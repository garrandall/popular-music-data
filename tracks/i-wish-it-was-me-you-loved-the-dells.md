Oh, oh, Lord
All alone again
You say it's been this way
Since you don't know when

There are a lot of places
A woman like you could go and see
Why your man won't take you
Is a mystery to me

Oh, I wish, how I wish
It was me you loved
Baby, I wish, how I wish
It was me you loved

Honest to God
Such a pretty thing
All locked up in
The crib by yourself

He comes home from work
Just to eat and sleep
He even make you promises
He'll never keep

Yet you stand by him
All faithful and can be
Can't you see you'd be better off
With a man like me

How I wish, how I wish
It was me you loved
Hey, how I wish, how I wish
It was me you loved

He's running the streets at night
(Chasing after every skirt)
Chasing every skirt
All along, doing his dirty dirt
Oh, yes, he is

You're sitting home all alone
While your man
He's out having fun

Oh
(How I wish that it was me you loved)
I wish you were mine
How I wish, how I wish
(How I wish that it was me you loved)

I want you by my side
With every step I take
I want you with me
For the rest of my days

(How I wish that it was me you loved)
How I wish it was me you loved
How I wish, oh, I wish
It was me you loved

(How I wish that it was me you loved)...
I'll take you anywhere you wanna go...
