It's a new day, but it all feels old
It's a good life, that's what I'm told
But everything, it all just feels the same

At my high school, it felt more to me
Like a jail cell, a penitentiary
My time spent there only made me see

That I don't ever wanna be like you
I don't wanna do the things you do
I'm never gonna hear the words you say
And I don't ever wanna

I don't ever wanna be you
Don't wanna be just like you
What I'm sayin' is, this is the anthem
Throw all your hands up
You, don't wanna be you

Go to college, a university
Get a real job, that's what they said to me
But I could never live the way they want

I'm gonna get by and just do my time
Out of step, while they all get in line
I'm just a minor threat, so pay no mind

Do you really wanna be like them
Do you really wanna be another trend
Do you wanna be part of their drill
'Cause I don't ever wanna

I don't ever wanna be you
Don't wanna be just like you
What I'm sayin' is, this is the anthem
Throw all your hands up
You, don't wanna be you

Shake it once, that's fine
Shake it twice, that's okay
Shake it three times, you're playing with yourself again

You, don't wanna be just like you
What I'm sayin' is, this is the anthem
Throw all your hands up
Y'all got to feel me, sing if you're with me

You, don't wanna be just like you (be just like you)
This is the anthem throw all your hands up
Y'all got to feel me, sing if you're with me

Another loser anthem (whoa)
Another loser anthem (whoa)
Another loser anthem (whoa)
Another loser anthem
