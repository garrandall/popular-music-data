Dance dance on little girl
In the arms of someone new.
As you dance, as you twirl,
My heart dances with you.

Dance dance on little girl,
Tell me what I've done wrong.
Why should he hold you tight
While they're playing our song.

I am watching you,
Oh no no it cannot be.
While I'm watching you,
I'm wishing, hoping it's for me.

Dance dance on little girl,
Tell me why did we part.
Dance dance on little girl,
Dance out of my heart.

I am watching you,
Oh no no it cannot be.
While I'm watching you,
I'm wishing, hoping it's for me.

Dance dance on little girl,
Tell me why did we part.
Dance dance on little girl,
Dance out of my heart.
Oh look at you,
There you go go go.
Oh yes you know
That you're wrong wrong wrong...
