I'll go, I'll go to my grave
To my grave lovin' you (lovin' you) lovin' you
I'd give, I'd give all I've saved
I've saved lovin' you (lovin' you) lovin' you
Abd should, and should I live again
Even then, it won't end
For I'll go, I'll go to my grave
To my grave lovin' you (lovin' you) lovin' you

Bridge:
Oh, to take his place forever
There's nothin' I wouldn't give
I'd prove to you daily what a man really is

I'll lay, I'll lay down my life
Down my life lovin' you (lovin' you) lovin' you
I'd work, I'd work day and night
Day and night lovin' you (lovin' you)
Lovin' you, lovin' you
And when, and when life calls us both above
Honey, you'll know that you'd been loved
For I'll go, I'll go to my grave
To my grave lovin' you (lovin' you) lovin' you...
