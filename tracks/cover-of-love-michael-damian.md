Cover Of Love
Michael Damian
Susie sits all alone
She waits by the telephone
Joey's out having fun
Waits to call when she's not at home
She gets scared and then takes off
And runs from the cover of love
He knows that he'll find her there
And knows what she'd thinking of
I know the broken hearted
When I look in their eyes I see
Is it the world that's changing
And turning away from me
Why do we run from the cover of love
Why do we run from the cover of love
You and I have been through this
A million times or more
Don't we know it's the same routine
So what are we fighting for
We all go and waste our time
But we are all the same
All we do is just to tun away
And play the same old game
You know the broken hearted
When you look in my eyes you see
Is it my life that's changing
And getting away from me
Why do we run from the cover of love
Why do we run from the cover of love
The changing heart knows no bound
Time may stand still
Emotions keep turning the fire burns on and on
You know the broken hearted
When you look in my eyes you'll see
Is it my life that's changing
And getting away from me
Why do we run from the cover of love
Why do we run from the cover of love
