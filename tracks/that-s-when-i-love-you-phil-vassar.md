When I hear you stop and laugh out loud
When you're fallin' fast asleep
When you're in the middle of a crowd
When you're lyin' close to me
When I hear you softly say my name
When you're high and when you're low
When you don't need me to explain
'Cause you already know
When you smile that way
I know, every night and day

That's when I love you, when I need you
When I care about you
That's when I know without a doubt
That I can't live without you
Everyday I find another reason
Every season we go through
And every little thing you do
That's when I love you

When you're drivin' in your car
When you dance and sing to the radio
When you're walkin' underneath the stars
Anywhere and everywhere you go
When you're dressed up or you're dressed down
When you're talkin' on the phone
With a million people all around
Or when you're all alone
When you're near, or you're far
You're in my heart no matter where you are

That's when I love you, when I need you
When I care about you
That's when I know without a doubt
That I can't live without you
Everyday I find another reason
Every season we go through
And every little thing you do
That's when I love you

When you smile that way
I know, every night and day

That's when I love you, when I need you
When I care about you
That's when I know without a doubt
That I can't live without you
Everyday I find another reason
Every season we go through
And every little thing you do
That's when I love you

That's when I love you, when I need you
When I care about you
That's when I know without a doubt
That I can't live without you
Everyday I find another reason
Every season we go through
And every little thing you do
That's when I love you

That's when I love you
