Don't you wanna rain dance with me?
Don't you wanna rain dance with me?
Don't you wanna rain dance with me?
Don't you wanna rain dance with me?


Fifi said to Don the Baker
"Can you show me how to bake another bun, Don?"
And I'm still sitting with my next-door neighbor saying
"Where'd you get the gun, John?"


Don't you wanna rain dance with me?
Don't you wanna rain dance with me?
Don't you wanna rain dance with me?
Don't you wanna rain dance with me?


Christopher was asking the astronomer
"Can your telescope tell me where the sun's gone?"
And I'm still sitting with my next-door neighbor saying
"Where'd you get the gun, John?"


Don't you wanna rain dance with me?
Don't you wanna rain dance with me?
Don't you wanna rain dance with me?
Don't you wanna rain dance with me?


Changing just a few things
Laughing while the bell rings on the door
Changing just a few things
Shooting when the bird sings


Don't you wanna rain dance with me?
Don't you wanna rain dance with me?
Don't you wanna rain dance with me?
Don't you wanna rain dance with me?
