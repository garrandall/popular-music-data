If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway?
Would you have my baby?


If you were a carpenter
And I were a lady
I'd marry you anyway
I'd have your baby


If a tinker was my trade
Would I still find you


I'd be carrying the pots you made
Following behind you


Save your  love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onliness
Give me your tomorrow


If I were a miller
At a mill wheel grinding
Would you miss your color blouse
And your soft shoe shining?


If you were a miller
At a mill wheel grinding
I'd miss my color blouse
And my soft shoe shining


Save your  love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onliness
Give me your tomorrow


If I worked my hands in wood
Would you still love me?


I'd answered you, "Yes I would"
And would you not be above me


If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady


I'd marry you anyway
I'd have your baby


Save your  love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onliness
Give me your tomorrow
