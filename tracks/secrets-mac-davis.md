Can't be no secrets
If we're going to last
Can't keep anything from me
Future, present or past

Unanswered questions
And shades of gray
Lead to suspicion
That ain't the way

Secrets
There should never be
Secrets
Between you and me

Hidden truth or fantasy
Got nothing to hide
Come on and open up for me
Let me come inside

What I don't haunts me
What you don't say burns
There's nothing you can show me that'll shock me
Nothing I don't want to learn

Secrets
There should never be
Secrets
Between you and me

Oh

Secrets
There should never be
Secrets
Between you and me

Oh

Between you and me
There should never be (secrets)
Secrets (secrets)
Never be secrets (secrets)
(Secrets secrets)
