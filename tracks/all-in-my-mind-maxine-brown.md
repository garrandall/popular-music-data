I think that you don't care
And its more than I can bare
I don't know baby
Maybe its all in my mind, all in my mind

I know that I've been true
But honey sweetie baby what about you?
I don't know baby
Maybe its all in my mind

We've been going steady so long
I'd never dream you would ever do me wrong
I knew I was yours and I thought you were mine
And that every little thing was so fine

Whoa darling Id hate to see
Someone else with you other than me
I don't know baby
Maybe its all in my mind
All in mind
Oh, hum, hum
Oh yes, its all in my mind

I don't mean to think so mean and evil baby
Please tell me, tell me
It's all in my mind
