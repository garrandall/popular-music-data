The boy next door has really got me dreamin'
(dum-dee-dum-dee-dum, the boy next door)
But I remember when he was a little demon
(dum-dee-dum-dee-dum, the boy next door)

He used to pull my hair
But I didn't really care
I loved him even then
When he was twelve and I was ten

The boy next door used to take my toys away
(dum-dee-dum-dee-dum, the boy next door)
But now he's busy keeping all of the boys away
(dum-dee-dum-dee-dum, the boy next door)

He's jealous as can be
But that's alright with me
He told all the other guys
"Stay away if you value your life"

The boy next door wants to move across the street
(dum-dee-dum-dee-dum, the boy next door)
He wants to get married, gonna make my life complete
(dum-dee-dum-dee-dum, the boy next door)

So if you're looking â€˜round
For a boy in your home town
The one that you're looking for
Just might be the boy next door

Oh, the boy next door
(dum-dee-dum-dee-dum, the boy next door)
