She a-ain't, she ain't you
No, she a-ain't, she ain't you
No, she a-ain't, she ain't you
No, she a-ain't, she ain't you


You make it hard for me to see somebody else
I'm calling her your name
Yeah, it's messed up 'cause I'm thinking 'bout you
It's your fault, babe, I never wanted us to break up
No, not this way, but you don't understand it, girl


When she touches me, I'm wishing that they were your hands
And when I'm with her, it's only 'bout the sex
With you, I had a bad romance
And if I could just trade her in, I would
'Cause nobody compares to you, no, yeah


I think I better let her go (Go), 'cause I can't leave you alone (Oh)
Every day that I'm with her, all I want is you (Yeah)
I wanna leave but I'm afraid (Afraid), that you don't even feel the same (The same)
And now I realize, that she ain't you
No, she ain't you


Oh-oh, oh (Oh, no, no-no, no)
Whoa-oh, oh (Oh, no, no-no, no)
Whoa-oh (She ain't you)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
'Cause she ain't, no, she ain't you


I've been sleeping out for quite some nights now
It's not the same in my bed
But if she found out what's going on in my head
It'll be all bad, have me right back
But you don't understand it, girl, no


When she touches me, I'm wishing that they were your hands
And when I'm with her, it's only 'bout the sex
With you, I had a bad romance
And if I could (And if I could) just trade her in, I would (I would)
'Cause nobody compares to you, no, yeah (Compares to you)


I think I better let her go (Go), 'cause I can't leave you alone (Oh)
Every day that I'm with her, all I want is you (Yeah)
I wanna leave but I'm afraid (Afraid), that you don't even feel the same (The same)
And now I realize, that she ain't you
No, she ain't you


She a-ain't, she ain't you
No, she a-ain't, she ain't you
No, she a-ain't, she ain't you
No, she a-ain't, she ain't you
No, she a-ain't, she ain't you
No, she a-ain't, she ain't you
No, she a-ain't, she ain't you
No, sheâ€”


I think I better let her go (Hey), 'cause I can't leave you alone (Whoa-oh)
Every day that I'm with her, all I want is you, girl (Yeah)
I wanna leave but I'm afraid (Afraid), that you don't even feel the same (The same)
And now I realize, that she ain't you
No, she ain't you


Oh-oh, oh (Oh)
Oh na-na-na-na (Oh na-na-na-na-na)
Whoa-oh, oh
Oh na-na-na-na (Hey, hey)
Whoa-oh (She ain't you)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
'Cause she ain't, no, she ain't you
