Okay everybody, are you ready for this?
Watch out, cause here we go again!

And it looks like daylight
Gonna catch me up, gonna catch me up again
People are getting up,
We're just getting in
That's the only, only time
When me and my baby can unwind

Five o'clock in the morning
Party's still going strong
There's a conversation over in the corner
And dancin' on the lawn

Oh, and the music is groovin'
Everybody's getting down in their stocking feet, yeah
Sleepy eyes are peepin'
Through the window from across the street

And it looks like daylight
Gonna catch me up, gonna catch me up again
People are getting up,
We're just getting in
Oh, but that's the only, only time
When me and my sweet baby can unwind

And I swore to myself, yes I did
Time and time again
That I would give up the night life
And start layin' in

But it ain't easy, no no
Sayin' no to my friends
Cause the real set don't get started
Til everybody else is in

And it looks like daylight
Gonna catch me up, gonna catch me up again
People are getting up,
We're just getting in
But that's the only, only time
When me and my sweet baby get a chance to unwind

Daylight
Daylight, gonna catch me up again
Daylight
Daylight, gonna catch me up again

Daylight, gonna catch me up, gonna catch me up
Daylight, gonna catch me up again
Daylight, gonna catch me up, gonna catch me up
Daylight, gonna catch me up again

Oh, and it looks like daylight, say what?
Gonna catch me up, gonna catch me up again
People are getting up,
We're just getting in
That's the only, only, only time
When me and my sweet baby, whoo, get a chance to unwind

You know I swore to myself, yes I did
Time and time, time, time again
That I would give it all up and give up the night life
And start layin' in

But it is not easy, no no no
Sayin' "Sorry, no, I can't go out" to my friends
Cause the real set does not get started, no no
Til everybody else is in

Oh, and it looks like daylight, say what?
Gonna catch me up, gonna catch me up again
People are getting up,
We're just getting in
Oh but that's the only, only time
When me and my baby get a chance to unwind

Daylight, gonna catch me up, gonna catch me up
Daylight, gonna catch me up again
Daylight, gonna catch me up, gonna catch me up
Daylight, gonna catch me up again

Daylight
Daylight, gonna catch me

Daylight, gonna catch me up, gonna catch me up
Daylight, gonna catch me up again
Daylight, gonna catch me up, gonna catch me up
Daylight, gonna catch me up again

Daylight, gonna catch me up, gonna catch me up
Daylight, gonna catch me up again
Daylight, gonna catch me up, gonna catch me up
Daylight, gonna catch me up again
