I'm somebody's daughter, somebody's friend
A shoulder to lean on no matter when
I'm somebody's teacher when they don't understand
Got a seat in the bleachers, I'm the world's biggest fan ohh well

I wish I was half the woman I've got to be
I wish I had all the answers right in front of me
I'm everything to everyone and I'm scared as I can be
Cause when I look into the mirror all I see is me

I'm somebody's sweetheart, somebody's girl
Someone's direction to find their way in this world
And I've got to be perfect even when I feel bad
I've got to keep giving when I gave all I had ohh well

I wish I was half the woman I've got to be
I wish I had all the answers right in front of me
I'm everything to everyone and I'm scared as I can be
Cause when I look into the mirror all I see is me ohhh

When I feel uncertain, I'm on my knees to pray
I know that it's all worth it, but at the end of the day

I wish I was half the woman I've got to be
I wish I had all the answers right in front of me
I'm everything to everyone and I'm scared as I can be
Cause when I look into the mirror all I see is...

Somebody's daughter, somebody's girl
Someone's direction to find their way in this world
