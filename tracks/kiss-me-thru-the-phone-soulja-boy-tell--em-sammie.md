Soulja Boy tell 'em


Baby, you know that I miss you, I wanna get with you tonight
But I cannot, baby girl, and that's the issue
Girl, you know I miss you, I just wanna kiss you
But I can't right now so, baby
Kiss me through the phone (Kiss me through the phone)
I'll see you later on (Later on)
Kiss me through the phone (Kiss me through the phone)
See you when I get home (When I get home)


Baby, I know that you like me, you my future wifey
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, yeah
You can be my Bonnie, I can be your Clyde
You could be my wife, text me, call me
I need you in my life, yeah all day every day I need ya
And every time I see ya my feelings get deeper
I miss ya, I miss ya, I really wanna kiss you but I can't
Six, seven, eight, triple nine, eight, two, one, two


Baby, you know that I miss you, I wanna get with you tonight
But I cannot, baby girl, and that's the issue
Girl, you know I miss you, I just wanna kiss you
But I can't right now so, baby
Kiss me through the phone (Kiss me through the phone)
I'll see you later on (Later on)
Kiss me through the phone (Kiss me through the phone)
See you when I get home (When I get home)


Baby, I been thinking lately so much about you
Everything about you, I like it, I love it
Kissing you in public, thinking nothing of it
Roses by the dozen, talking on the phone
Baby you so sexy, your voice is so lovely
I love your complexion, I miss ya, I miss ya, I miss ya
I really wanna kiss you but I can't
Six, seven, eight, triple nine, eight, two, one, two


Baby, you know that I miss you, I wanna get with you tonight
But I cannot, baby girl, and that's the issue
Girl, you know I miss you, I just wanna kiss you
But I can't right now so, baby
Kiss me through the phone (Kiss me through the phone)
I'll see you later on (Later on)
Kiss me through the phone (Kiss me through the phone)
See you when I get home (When I get home)


She call my phone like:
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
We on the phone like:
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
We taking pics like:
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
She dial my number like:
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Six, seven, eight, triple nine, eight, two, one, two


Baby, you know that I miss you, I wanna get with you tonight
But I cannot, baby girl, and that's the issue
Girl, you know I miss you, I just wanna kiss you
But I can't right now so, baby
Kiss me through the phone (Kiss me through the phone)
I'll see you later on (Later on)
Kiss me through the phone (Kiss me through the phone)
See you when I get home (When I get home)
