King Tut (King Tut)
Now when he was a young man
He never thought he'd see
People stand in line to see the boy king

(King Tut) How'd you get so funky?
(Funky Tut) Did you do the monkey?
Born in Arizona
Moved to Babylonia (king Tut)

(King Tut) Now, if I'd known
They'd line up just to see him
I'd taken all my money
And bought me a museum. (king Tut)

Buried with a donkey (funky Tut)
He's my favorite honkey!
Born in Arizona
Moved to Babylonia (king Tut)

(Tut, Tut) Dancin' by the Nile, (Disco Tut, Tut)
The ladies love his style, (boss Tut, Tut)
Rockin' for a mile (rockin' Tut, Tut)
He ate a crocodile

He gave his life for tourism
Golden idol!
He's an Egyptian

They're selling you!

{Instrumental bridge}

Now, when I die
Now don't think I'm a nut
Don't want no fancy funeral
Just one like old king Tut. (king Tut)

He coulda won a Grammy, (king Tut)
Buried in his Jammies, (king Tut)
{alternatively - His sister was a mummy}
Born in Arizona, moved to Babylonia
He was born in Arizona, got a condo made of stone-a
King Tut!
