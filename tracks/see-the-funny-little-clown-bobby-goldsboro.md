See the funny little clown
See him laughing as you walk by
Everybody thinks he's happy
'Cause you never see a tear in his eye

No one knows he's crying
No one knows he's dying on the inside
'Cause he's laughing on the outside, mm
No one knows, no one knows

See the funny little clown
He's hiding behind a smile
They all think he's laughing
But I know he's really crying all the while

How his heart is aching
How his heart is breaking on the inside
But he keeps laughing on the outside, mm
No one knows, no one knows

This funny little clown
You never used to see him around
Without his girl beside him
To love and guide him

Until one day his girl just walked away
And to this very day he says
"He never loved her anyway"
Mm, and no one knows except for me
Because you see I'm that funny little clown
