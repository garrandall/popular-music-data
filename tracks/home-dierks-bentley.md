West, on a plane bound west
I see her stretching out below
Land, blessed mother land
The place where I was born
Scars, yeah she’s got her scars
Sometimes it starts to worry me
Cause lose, I don’t wanna lose
Sight of who we are


From the mountains high
To the wave crashed coast
There’s a way to find
Better days I know


It’s been a long hard ride
Got a ways to go
But this is still the place
That we all call home


Free, nothing feels like free
Though it sometimes means we don’t get along
Cause same, no we're not the same
But that’s what makes us strong


From the mountains high
To the wave crashed coast
There’s a way to find
Better days I know


It’s been a long hard ride
Got a ways to go
But this is still the place
That we all call home


Brave, gotta call it brave
To chase that dream across the sea
Names, and they signed their names
For something they believed
Red, how the blood ran red
And we laid our dead in sacred ground
Just think, wonder what they think
If they could see us now


It’s been a long hard ride
Got a ways to go
But this is still the place
That we all call home


It’s been a long hard ride
And I won’t lose hope
This is still the place
That we all call home
