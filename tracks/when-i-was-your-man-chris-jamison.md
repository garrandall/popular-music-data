Followed all the wrong directions
Colored outside of the lines
Busy working on becoming
Someone I didn't recognize

Then you walked in my life
Couldn't see what was in front of me
'Til you opened my eyes
Fit in my arms so perfectly
My heart's racing, done wastin' time

Never thought I'd be standing here with you and me now
I fall to my knees, baby, I'll be yours eternally
You came along and changed my song with words I never had
When I got you holding my hand, I'm a better man

Couldn't look into the future
Too busy worrying about the past
The mistakes I made defined me 
Never thought I'd find something that lasts

Then you walked in my life
Couldn't see what was in front of me
'Til you opened my eyes
Fit in my arms so perfectly
My heart's racing, done wastin' time

Never thought I'd be standing here with you and me now
I fall to my knees, baby, I'll be yours eternally
You came along and changed my song with words I never had
When I got you holding my hand, I'm a better man

You found me broken
Build me up, made me whole again, yeah
All the words I've spoken are true
But long overdue

Never thought I'd be standing here with you and me now
I fall to my knees, baby, I'll be yours eternally
You came along and changed my song with words I never had
When I got you holding my hand
When I got you holding my hand
When I got you holding my hand
When I got you holding my hand, I'm a better man
