On your side of the bed, there's a picture of our wedding day
A clock that don't work and the bible that your daddy gave
It's on the window side, where the moon creeps in at night
Staring at the ceiling, lying here all alone
I said a prayer for you then I said one of my own
But you don't reach for me, when you lie down quietly


Tell me how, how'd you get so far away?
All we have left are the memories of the love we made
Are you sleeping with your own regret?
On your side of the bed


On your side of the bed there's a burned out candle flame
A letter I started but I didn't know what to say
No I couldn't write it down, so I'll try to say it now


Tell me how, how'd you get so far away?
All we have left are the memories of the love we made
Are you sleeping with your own regret?
On your side of the bed


Aren't you even going to make a sound?
Your side of the bed
Turn the other way when I turn the lights down
Your side of the bed
Are you lonely? Like I'm lonely?


How, how'd you get so far away?
All we have left are the memories of the love we made
Are you sleeping with your own regret?
On your side of the bed


On your side of the bed
Are you still awake, on your side of the bed
