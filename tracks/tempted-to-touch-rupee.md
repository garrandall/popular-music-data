Yo
To all the ladies in the dance
(Each and every princess)
Yeah aw, aw
Aw

I lose all control when I see you
Standing there in front of me
Your style, your clothes, your hair
You fair woman, you look so sexy
De way you wine and, de way you dance
And de way that you twist and turn your waist
Leaves me wanting, leaves me yearning
Leaves me feening for a taste

Before the end of the night
I wanna hold you so tight
You know I want you so much
And I'm so tempted to touch

Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I'm inside your clutch
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I'm inside your clutch

Yo
To all the ladies in the dance
(I'm looking at these ladies, thinking about one of them having my babies, uh)
Yeah aw, aw
Aw

I don't even know your name
Little woman, I don't even know your age (for real)
But there's something about you girl
When I see you whining in front the stage (something about you)
Please forgive me, please excuse me
But there's nothing else that a man can do (excuse me)
I can't help myself little woman
I just need to be next to you

Before the end of the night
I wanna hold you so tight
You know I want you so much
And I'm so tempted to touch

Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I'm inside your clutch
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I'm inside your clutch

I wanna feel you, I wanna squeeze you
I wanna hug and kiss and caress you
I wanna love you, I wanna touch you
And place no one else above you
I wanna feel you, I wanna squeeze you
I wanna hug and kiss and caress you
I wanna love you, I wanna touch you
You know woman I wanna wings of a dove you

Before the end of the night
I wanna hold you so tight
You know I want you so much
And I'm so tempted to touch

Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I'm inside your clutch
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I'm inside your clutch

Before the end of the night
I wanna hold you so tight
You know I want you so much
And I'm so tempted to touch

Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I'm inside your clutch
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I'm inside your clutch
