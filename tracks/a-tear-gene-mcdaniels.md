A tear... I can't stop this little drop of water called a tear Ever since you went away, this little drop of water has been here
So my darlin tell me why, why you wanna make me cry
Come here and stop this little drop of water called a tear
As long as you're in love, you'll find as you go through the years
From your heart, love will bring laughter
And from your eyes, love will bring tears, tears, tears, tears
A tear... what is this little drop of water called a tear
When you broke my little heart, this little drop of water of fears
I guess it's something I can't explain, why this little crystal of rain
Falls from my eyes, a little drop of water called a tear
O-o-oh
Keeps fallin from my eyes tears, tears, tears, tears, tears, tears, oh
