Psst
I've got a secret to tell

I'll let you into my secret
I'll let you into my secret


Can you keep it
Keep it up
When you get to the
Heart of the mystery

Can you keep it when you see
Why a treasure is
Buried in secrecy

I'll be waiting to let it go
It's been building up
For such a long time

Are you ready
Do you know
It's time for me to open your eyes


I'll let you into my secret
If you're in, you could never get out
I'll let you into my secret
Give the whispers something
To shout about


Can you keep it
Keep it up
When I whisper in
The dead of the night

Can you keep it when you feel
All the secrets
You're bringing to life

Revelation is the proof
You're the only one I want to know
Intonation, it's the truth
And it's so hot, you'll never let go


I'll let you into my secret
It keeps getting harder to hide
I'll let you into my secret
Cause I can't keep a secret
My double might


Keep coming closer
Cause I'm dying to tell you
Why'd I keep it
To myself so long

Keep coming closer
Cause the urge to tell you
Is burning me up, ooh
It's so strong

Into my secret
(Strong)
Into my secret

Keep coming closer
I can only whisper
You know I don't want
No one else to know

Keep coming closer
You're the only one
That I can trust to
Believe it's true


I'll let you into my secret
I'll let you into my secret
I'll let you into my secret
It keeps getting harder to hide
I'll let you into my secret
Cause I can't keep a secret
My double might

I'll let you into my secret
If you're in
You could never get out

I'll let you into my secret
Give the whispers something
To shout about

I'll let you into my secret
It keeps getting harder to hide
I'll let you into my secret
