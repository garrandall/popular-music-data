Leah, Leah
Leah, Leah

Here I go, from the hut to the boat to the sea, for Leah

Uh huh I've gotta go diving in the bay
Gotta get a lot of oysters, find some pearls today
To make a pretty necklace for Leah
Leah

I've gotta go deep and find the ones just right 
I'll bet my Leah'll be surprised tonight
I'll place the pearls around the only girl for me 
Leah

But something's wrong I cannot move around 
My leg is caught it's pulling me down
But I'll keep my hand shut tight for if they find me
They'll find the pearl for Leah

And now it's over, I'm awake at last
Old heartaches and memories from the past 
It was just another dream about my lost love 
About Leah

Leah, Leah
Leah, Leah

Here I go, back to sleep and in my dreams 
I'll be with Leah, Leah, Leah
