Here I come
The king of clowns
As I hide behind this smile and paint the town
Though I cry
Since you're gone
You'll never know because the show must go on

I've been sad (I've been sad)
I've been blue (I've been blue)
Ever since the day that you found someone new (someone new)
I pretend but you can't tell
With my broken heart I play my part so well

Step aside
Here I come
The king of clowns
As I hide the lonely teardrops that come down
I make believe with a smile
But the king of clowns is crying all the while

Here comes the king of clowns

Here comes the king of clowns

There are tears (there are tears)
You'll never see (never see)
No, you'll never see my tears and pity me (pity me)
Though I'm hurt
Still I'm proud
Always laughing as I walk among the crowd

Step aside
Here I come
The king of clowns
As I hide the lonely teardrops that come down
I make believe with a smile
But the king of clowns is crying all the while

Here comes the king of clowns

Here comes the king of clowns

Here comes the king of clowns
