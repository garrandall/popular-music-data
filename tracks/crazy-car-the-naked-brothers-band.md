Crazy Car,
To lead me no where,
Lead me no where,
Actually,
It's made for that,
Made for that

I have never seen you cry,
But why now baby, why oh why?
Take my hand and be my woman,
Just for a day.

Crazy Car,
To lead me no where,
Lead me no where.
Actually,
It's made for that,
Made for that.

Cra-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-zy Car
Cra-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-zy Car
Cra-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-zy Car
Cra-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-zy Car

Breaks my heart to see you sad,

I have never felt this bad.
Take my hand and be my woman,
Just for a day.

Crazy Car,
To lead me no where,
Lead me no where.
Actually,
It's made for that,
Made for that.

Cra-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-zy Car
Cra-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-zy Car
Cra-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-zy Car
Cra-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-zy Car

Cra-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-zy Car
Cra-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-zy Car
Cra-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-zy Car
Cra-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-zy Car
