Hear ye, hear ye
The court's in session
The court's in session, now
Here comes the judge

Here comes the judge
Here comes the judge
Here comes the judge, y'all
Here comes the judge

Stop eatin' that fudge
'Cause here comes the judge
Don't nobody budge
'Cause here comes the judge
Judge Shorty is presidin' today
And he don't take no stuff from nobody
No kind of way

Hey boy, take off that hat
Where do you think you're at
I know where you gon' be
If you don't heed my plea
I'm here to tell you
Court's in session
Order in the court now
Court's in session
Can't nobody smoke now
Here comes the judge
Here comes the judge

Here comes the judge
Here comes the judge
Here comes the judge, y'all
Here comes the judge

Order, order
What's the first case on the docket
Judge I got a boy here who can't dance
Can't dance? Aww (Can't dance your Honor)
Ninety days, thirty days for boogaloo
Thirty days to learn how to shing-a-ling
And thirty more for the Afro twist
Can't dance, what is this
Court's in session, everybody quiet now
Court's in session, here comes the judge
Here comes the judge

Is that the man?
No, your honor
Does he look like the man?
No, your Honor
Well, I'm sorry you got to go now
Ah ha you can't recognize the man
No, your Honor
You got to stand guilty

Here comes the judge
Here comes the judge
Here comes the judge, y'all
Here comes the judge

Ah yes, here comes the judge
They caught him stompin' down the aisle
Yes here comes the judge
I'd rather be lost in the jungles of Brazil
Than to face the judge
This morning the way he feels
Here comes the judge
Here comes the judge now
Don't nobody budge
'Cause here comes the judge
Everybody doin' their time today
