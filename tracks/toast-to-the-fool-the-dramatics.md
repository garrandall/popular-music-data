You gave your all and all to him, he was untrue
He tried to find another girl sweeter than you
Imagination sent him on a wild goose chase
And now he sees no other girl can ever take your place

So now he's trying hard again to win you back
But his heart is made of cellophane and you see through that
When he held your love in the palms of his hands
He wasn't satisfied, he charmed, and connived
And he had to have another girl right there on his side

Oh, let's give a toast
(Give a toast, give a toast, give a toast)
To the fool
(To the fool)
Who let you go
(Who let you go)
Let's give a toast

(Give a toast, give a toast, here's another toast)
To the fool
(To the fool)
Who let you
(Who let you go)
But now we're together he can't hurt you no more

Let's have another one, baby

Now when he held your love in the palms of his hands
He wasn't satisfied, I said he charmed and connived
And he had to have another girl right there on his side

Let's give a toast
(Give a toast, give a toast, give a toast)
To that fool
(To the fool)
Who let you go
(Who let you go)

He can't hurt you no more
(No, no, no)
Three cheers
(Three cheers, for the fool)
For the fool
(For the fool)

Who let you go
(Who let you go)
He can't hurt you no more (no, no, no)
I tip my hat
(Tip your hat)
To the fool

(To the fool)
To the fool
Who let you go
(Who let you go)
He can't hurt you no more
(No, no, no)
Let's give a toast

Ain't it funny babe
How can fate can work so strange?
Sometimes to get to love
You must go through so much pain
Now, you gave your love so unselfishly
And all that you got back in return was misery

I'm glad, I'm glad, I'm glad it all turned out this way
You would never have left him
Had he not drove you away
But his lost was our every gain
And the love that we share together now
Is his every, every pain

Oh let's give a toast
(Give a toast, give a toast, give a toast)
To that fool
(To the fool)
Who let you go
(Who let you go)

Let's give a toast
(Give a toast, give a toast, here's another toast)
To the fool
(To the fool)
Who let you go
(Who let you go)
But now we're together he can't hurt you no more

Let's give a toast, baby
To that fool
(To the fool)
Who let you go
(Who let you go)

Let's give a toast
(Toast, yeah)
To the fool
(To the fool)
Who let you go?
(Who let you go?)
But now we're together he can't hurt you no more
