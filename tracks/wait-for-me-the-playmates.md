(Wait wait for me wait wait for me
Johnny wait for me)

When I first met her she was only three
And I remember how she followed me
She was always getting in my way

And I still yes I still can hear her say
(Wait for me wait for me Johnny please wait for me
I love you more than I can hardly stand
Wait for me wait for me Johnny please wait for me
I'll grow up just as fast as I can
Wait for me wait for me wait for me wait for me)

As we grew older she would always wait
She'd wait for me by the schoolyard gate
I would yell at her to go away

And I still yes I still can hear her say
(Wait for me wait for me Johnny please wait for me
I love you more than I can hardly stand
Wait for me wait for me Johnny please wait for me
I'll grow up just as fast as I can
Wait for me wait for me wait for me wait for me)

And now we're grown up but she didn't wait
And I'm in love with her but it's too late
She just married someone else today

And I still yes I still can hear her say
(Wait for me wait for me Johnny please wait for me
I love you more than I can hardly stand
Wait for me wait for me Johnny please wait for me
I'll grow up just as fast as I can
Wait for me wait for me wait for me wait for me)

Johnny, wait for me!
