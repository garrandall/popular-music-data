Thirty years since all this happened
Thirty years it took to rise
Blood on the floor and in their eyes
They took the bite and left them to die
Thirty years and now I'm here
The only one left to scream in fear
Your job means nothing when I've got you running
Away with blood in your tears
Take a look at me
Can you see the death in my eyes?
All the time you're waiting, I get stronger with power and force
It's not as if they're paying you much


In Five Nights at Freddy's 3
I'll hunt you down and you will see
You burn alive
When you hit Night Five
That's life
In Five Nights at Freddy's 3
A horror ride built just for me
Your doom is near
Your time comes now
You're just too late
I'm coming for you now!

All these toys, yet not much time
Before I take your soul tonight
Piece by piece I build your fears
What can we use to end this right?
All these vents and all these rooms
The camera keeps you from your doom
Cause nothing stops me from the past that's rotting
I'M STILL HERE, BITCH!
Your fight ends soon!
Now I'm free to take your soul and place it in mine
All the time you're waiting, time grows longer and longer inside
Before you know it, your soul is mine



Thirty years ago, they used to be just toys
Just. Playmates
But then it happened
The fire in their eyes became unstoppable, indestructible
They were machines ready for their final act
But thirty years have passed
And patrons renewed the franchise, rebuilt the nightmare
Poor fools
What the fuck have they done?
WE'RE COMING FOR YOU!

12AM, you sit and stare
1AM, I start the fair
2AM, I zip and zoom
3AM, I come for you!
4AM, shit just got real
5AM, you know the deal!
Let's hope you make the last hour count!
It's time to die



What can we use?
The power divine
Your fight ends now
Burn alive in Night Five!
What can we use?
The power divine
Your fight ends now
Burn alive, in Night Five!
