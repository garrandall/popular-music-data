You're a very lovely woman
But I think I better turn you down this time.
'Cause you've used all of your charms on me
And I kind of miss the things I left behind.

A girl who loves me, is thinking of me, my home and friends
But you're a lovely woman (A very lovely woman)
Lovely woman (A very lovely woman)

And now you ask me to forget the things
It took me long to get and find.
And go away with you again
And follow you in sin and drink your wine.

I've made my mind up I will not wind up a life in sin
But you're a lovely woman (A very lovely woman)
Lovely woman (A very lovely woman)

And oh even though you're lovely
Your world is ugly so come back no more.
For all that you have to offer
Is not enough to ruin my life for.

You're a very lovely woman
Very lovely, yes you are.

And oh even though you're lovely
Your world is ugly so come back no more.
For all that you have to offer
Is not enough to ruin my life for.

You're a very lovely woman
But I think I better turn you down this time.
'Cause you've used all of your charms on me
And I kind of miss the things I left behind.

A girl who loves me, is thinking of me, my home and friends
But you're a lovely woman (A very lovely woman)
Lovely woman (A very lovely woman)
Lovely woman (A very lovely woman)
Lovely woman (A very lovely woman)
Lovely woman
