My mama told me love
Is not all sweet, uh huh
She said, watch out for all
The boys you meet, uh huh
Cause someday, you'll be on
Your own two feet, uh huh

But if you find
The right boy to marry
Life can be a bowl of cherries
Like peaches and cream
Don't you know what I mean

Ah, ah, ah, peaches
Peaches and cream
Ah, ah, ah, peaches
Don't you know what I mean

Now I'm grown and
Living on my own, uh huh
Got me a boy, I know
He's not alone, uh huh
He's the kind of boy a
Girl can take home, uh huh

I know I found
The boy to marry
Cause our life's been
A bowl of cherries
Don't you know what I mean

Ah, ah, ah, peaches
Peaches and cream
Ah, ah, ah, peaches
Don't you know what I mean

I know I found
The boy to marry
Cause our life's been
A bowl of cherries
Don't you know what I mean

Ah, ah, ah, peaches
Ah, ah, ah, peaches
Peaches and cream
Peaches and cream

Ah, ah, ah, peaches
Ah, ah, ah, peaches
Peaches and cream
Don't you know what I mean

Ah, ah, ah, peaches
