You won't forget my eyes
Ooh deep inside you realize
You're gonna see me wherever you go
You're gonna hear me on your radio
There you are in your car
And suddenly
You hear me
"Do you want me
Do you want me"

Take me to heart
I promise you a miracle
Take me to heart
You're gonna be mine
Take me to heart
You know it's just a matter of time

I'm always on your mind
I'm the chill that never left your spine
In the building where you live and breathe
I'm the sound that never lets you sleep
Down the hall through the walls
You hear a voice that's calling
"Do you want me
Do you want me"

Take me to heart
Don't deny the miracle
Take me to heart
What more can I say
Take me to heart
Surrender's just a motion away
