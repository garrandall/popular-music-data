If I Say

Laying here baby counting stars
Want to know how it got this far, baby
Just you and me
How could we say didn't know
The heartache of letting go babe
Couldn't you see
I don't know
Yeah

I've been missing you
If I see you tomorrow
Don't you know it's not too long babe
If I see you crying
Can you see our love's so strong
You gotta know, I said I think I need you

Rain may go away, and come back some other day, babe
I need the sun to shine
It doesn't matter, don't you know
Doesn't matter where I go, baby
You're always on my mind
I need you there

[I've been missing you
If I see you tomorrow
Don't you know it's not too long babe
If I see you crying
Can you see our love's so strong
You gotta know, I said I think I need you

I need you there
I've been missing you
If I see you tomorrow
Don't you know it's not too long babe
If I see you crying
You gotta know our love's strong babe
If I hear you, don't you know I'll be there
If I see
I need to tell you baby
I said that I think that I love you
