I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama, hm
I ain't your mama, boy, I ain't your mama
When you gon' get your act together?
I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama, no


Wake up and rise and shine, ah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Best get to work on time, ah-yeah-yeah-yeah
No more playing video games, ah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Things are about to change, 'round here, 'round here


We used to be crazy in love
Can we go back to how it was?
When did you get too comfortable?
Cause I'm too good for that, I'm too good for that
Just remember that, hey!


I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama, hm
I ain't your mama, boy, I ain't your mama
When you gon' get your act together?
I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama, no


Lucky to have these curves, ah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Stop getting on my nerves, ah-yeah-yeah-yeah
You still tryna ride this train? Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Cause some things have gotta change, 'round here, here, here


We used to be crazy in love
Can we go back to how it was?
When did you get too comfortable? Hey
Cause I'm too good for that, I'm too good for that
Just remember that, hey!


I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama (I ain't your mama, no)
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama (I ain't your mama, hey, hey)
I ain't your mama, boy, I ain't your mama (Oh, hey!)
When you gon' get your act together?
I ain't your mama (I ain't your mama)
No, I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama, no
I ain't your mama, no


We used to be crazy in love
Can we go back to how it was?
When did you get too comfortable?
Cause I'm too good for that, I'm too good for that
Just remember that, hey!


I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama (I ain't your mama)
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama (I ain't your mama, hey)
I ain't your mama, boy, I ain't your mama (Ah no no, ah no no)
When you gon' get your act together? ('Cause I ain't your mama, hey!)
I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama ('Cause I ain't your mama, hey!)
I ain't your mama, boy, I ain't your mama (Na na na, na na na)
When you gon' get your act together? (No, I ain't your mama, no)
No, I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama
No, I ain't your mama, no
