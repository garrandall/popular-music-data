Jesse's in a new low rider outside Frank's Drive-in
He's there with Juanita and the gang, but nodding out again
Jesse you're a fool to yourself
'Cause you won't stop
You can't take it with you
Jesse you're losing yourself


Oh don't be a fool again
There may not be a next time
Oh, don't be a fool again, Jesse


Jesse, there's a whole world out there
That you can't ignore
But nickel bags and chrome-lined cars
Is that all that you want
Jesse, you can't get their respect if you don't stop
You don't even want to
Jesse, you're losing yourself
