I feel like I'm sitting on time bomb baby
And it's going to explode
Yes I'm sitting on a time bomb baby
Everyday I know you're going to blow right up
Thru the prime of the day there'll be no more of me

Time bomb, time bomb
Going to blow me high
Time bomb, time bomb
Blow me to the sky
Time bomb, time bomb
Going to blow me high

You thought you knew it all
And love was blind
And you don't want to fight
It makes such a foolish game
And now it seems that
You must pay the price
You lit the fuse
And now it's only time, before it all goes off
At least it's no surprise
You know the score
Come in, your time is up
Everyday I feel it ticking in my heart
Time to say, cause here we go with
Three, two, one

Time bomb, time bomb
Going to blow me high
Time bomb, time bomb
Blow me to the sky
Time bomb, time bomb
Going to blow me high

Feel like I'm sitting on a time bomb baby
And it's going to explode
Yes I'm sitting on a time bomb baby
I feel...
