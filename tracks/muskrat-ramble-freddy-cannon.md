A-look at them shuffle
And a-shufflin' down
A-ramblin', a-scramblin'
A-headin' for town
A-hustle and a-bustle
And a-buzzin' around
Happily awaitin' at the station

A-look at that train, no. 709
A-huffin', a-puffin', arrivin' on time
A-who do you think's about to arrive?
The band they call the Dixieland Five

They gonna play
That muskrat ramblin' tune
Like the way you never heard it played
A-get ready for the big parade

All together now, one and two
Join that happy throng
A-feel the beat of that ramblin', scramblin' muskrat song
Come on and ramble along, whoa

A-look at them shuffle
And a-shufflin' down
A-ramblin', a-scramblin'
A-headin' for town
A-hustle and a-bustle
And a-buzzin' around
Happily awaitin' at the station

A-look at that train, no. 709
A-huffin', a-puffin', arrivin' on time
A-who do you think's about to arrive?
The band they call the Dixieland Five

They're gonna play
That muskrat ramblin' tune
The way you never heard it played
A-get ready for the big parade

Now all together now, one and two
Join that happy throng
A-feel the beat of that ramblin', scramblin' muskrat song
Come on and ramble along, whoa

Whoa

Whoa

Whoa
