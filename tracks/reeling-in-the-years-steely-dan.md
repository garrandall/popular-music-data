Your everlasting summer you can see it fading fast
So you grab a piece of something that you think is gonna last
Well you wouldn't even know a diamond if you held it in your hand
The things you think are precious I can't understand

Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?

Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?

You been tellin' me you're a genius since you were seventeen
In all the time I've known you I still don't know what you mean
The weekend in the college didn't turn out like you planned
The things that pass for knowledge I can't understand

Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?

Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?
I spent a lot of money and I spent a lot of time
The trip we made to hollywood is etched upon my mind
After all the things we've done and seen you find another man
The things you think are useless I can't understand
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?
