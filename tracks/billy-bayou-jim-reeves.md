Back about eighteen hundred some
A Louisiana couple had a redheaded son
No name suited him the Jim Jack or Joe
They just called him Billy Bayou

Billy Billy Bayou watch where you go your walking on quicksand walk slow
Billy Billy Bayou watch what you say a pretty girl will get you one of these days

Bill was big for his size
Red hair and freckles and big blue eyes
Thirteen years form the day he was born
He fought the battle of the Little Big Horn

Billy Billy Bayou watch where you go your walking on quicksand walk slow
Billy Billy Bayou watch what you say a pretty girl will get you one of these days

One sad day Billy sed cried ho! ho!
I can whip the fathers of Geronmino
He got smart the chief got mad
This nearly ended our Louisiana lad

Billy Billy Bayou watch where you go your walking on quicksand walk slow
Billy Billy Bayou watch what you say a pretty girl will get you one of these days

One day in eighteen-seventyeight
A pretty girl walked up to Bill's front
He didn't know whether to stand or run
He wound up married cose he did eather one

Billy Billy Bayou watch where you go your walking on quicksand walk slow
Billy Billy Bayou watch what you say a pretty girl will get you one of these days

Pretty girl will get you one of these days
