Back about eighteen hundred and some a Louisiana couple had a red headed son
No name soothe him Jim Jack or Joe they just called him Billy Bayou
Billy Billy Bayou watch where you go you're walkin' on quick sand and walk slow
Billy Billy Bayou watch what you say a pretty girl'll get you one of these days

Billy was a boy kinda big for a size red hair and freckles and big blue eyes
Thirteen years from the day he was born Billy fought the battle of the Little Big Horn
Billy Billy Bayou...

One said day Billy cried ho-ho I can whip the feathers of Geronimo
He smarted off the chief got mad this nearly ended our Louisiana lad
Billy Billy Bayou...

One day in eighteen-seventy-eight a pretty girl walked through Bill's front gate
He didn't know whether to stand there and run
He would up married cause he did neighter one
Billy Billy Bayou...
A pretty girl'll get you one of these days
