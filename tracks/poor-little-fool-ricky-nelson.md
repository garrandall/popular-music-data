I used to play around with hearts that hastened at my call
But when I met that little girl I knew that I would fall

Poor little fool, oh yeah, I was a fool, uh huh..

She played around and teased me with her carefree devil eyes
She'd hold me close and kiss me but her heart was full of lies

Poor little fool, oh yeah, I was a fool, uh huh..

She told me how she cared for me and that we'd never part
And so for the very first time I gave away my heart

Poor little fool, oh yeah, I was a fool, uh huh..

The next day she was gone and I knew she'd lied to me
She left me with a broken heart and won her victory

Poor little fool, oh yeah, I was a fool, uh huh..

Well I've played this game with other hearts, but I never thought I'd see
The day that someone else would play love's foolish game with me

Poor little fool, oh yeah, I was a fool, uh huh..
Poor little fool, oh yeah, I was a fool, uh huh..
