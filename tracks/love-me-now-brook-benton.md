If you're ever going to love me
Love me now (love me now)
And if you have something
Good to tell me, tell me now
(Tell me now)

Darling, don't wait til I'm gone
Then chisel it in marble
On an ice cold stone
If you're ever going to love me
Love me now (love me now)

Why put off for tomorrow
What we should do today
There may not be a tomorrow
Life is funny that way

So if you're ever going to love me
Love me now (love me now)
If you're ever going to love me
Love me now (love me now)
