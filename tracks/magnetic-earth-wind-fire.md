No self-control
A chain reaction as my body lets go
A strange kind of light
The tempo takes me and the circuit excites

It's magnetic
The rhythm of a dangerous dance
Let's dance in the static
Suck you in twice as fast
Magnetic
The rhythm of a dangerous dance
Let's dance in the static
Suck you in, you'll never last

Step into the light
Make the spark ignite
Step into the light tonight

No place to hide
I keep on runnin' but I'm falling behind
A new kind of beat
It takes your mind, then it takes your feet

It's magnetic
The rhythm of a dangerous dance
Let's dance in the static
Suck you in twice as fast
Magnetic
The rhythm of a dangerous dance
Let's dance in the static
Suck you in, you'll never last

Are we making contact tonight?
Don't break the circuit
I'll be making contact tonight
Don't break the circuit
