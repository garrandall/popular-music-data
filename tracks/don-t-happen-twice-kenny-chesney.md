I haven't seen you in forever
Oh you haven't changed a bit
You didn't think that I would remember
How could I forget


We sang Bobby McGhee on the hood of my car
Made a wish on every star
In that clear September sky
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
3 am I fell in love
For the first time in my life
Oh that's something that just don't happen twice


To this day I still taste that first kiss
How I prayed it wouldn't end
In a way, seeing you like this
I guess it never really did


We sang Bobby McGhee on the hood of my car
Made a wish on every star
In that clear September sky
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
3 am I fell in love
For the first time in my life
Oh that's something that just don't happen twice


One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
3 am I fell in love
For the first time in my life
Oh that's something, baby that's something
Oh that's something
That just don't happen twice


Oh yeah

We sang Bobby McGhee on the hood of my car
Made a wish on every star
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
Yeah we fell in love
