I was taught to never tell a lie
To look you in the eye and tell it like it is
Always thought that you would be the same
It's such a shame that's not the way it is

I was fooled by your innocence
And my love for you was so intense
With our connection only physical
If it got me through the night
Well that's a lie

Hey little liar I believed in you
Hey little liar I believed in you
Hey little liar I believed in you oh

A simple question makes you look away
Your hesitation gives it all away
There's some protection in the way you move
If there's sadness in my eyes
It's coming from your lies

Hey little liar I believed in you
Hey little liar I believed in you
Hey little liar I believed in you
I believed in you

You want to sleep with me but payback's tough
Why don't you call me when you're all grown up
If there's a change in you I'll know it's true
Hey little liar I believed in you

Hey little liar I believed in you
Hey little liar I believed in you
Hey little liar I believed in you
Hey little liar I believed in you
Hey little liar I believed in you
Hey little liar I believed in you
Hey little liar I believed in you
Hey little liar I believed in you
Hey little liar
Hey little liar
Hey little liar
