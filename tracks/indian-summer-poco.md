There's a full moon in the sky
It's got a hold on me, I'm hyptotized
Like your love it's getting stronger
Please keep my heart a little longer

Indian Summer is on it's way
Cool at night - and hot all day
Ain't no black clouds filled with rain
Santa Ana wind blew them all to Maine

Baby takes my hand
She says she understands
About the way I feel
She knows this love is real

I'm a wide open space cowboy
I got lazy ways I got some hidden joy
Motorcycle and tons of RPM
Ain't gonna wait around till it's here again

Baby takes my hand...

Indian Summer is on it's way
