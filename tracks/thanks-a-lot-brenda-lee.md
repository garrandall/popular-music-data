Thanks thanks a lot
I got a broken heart, that's all I've got
You made me cry, I cried a lot
Oh I lost your love, hm hm baby thanks a lot
You told my friends, as I was passing by
That you're not sorry, that you made me cry
You said I deserved, ah just what I got
Well if that's how you feel, ah honey thanks a lot
Thanks thanks thanks thanks a lot
I've got a broken heart
That's all I've got, you're made me cry
Lord I cried a lot, I lost your love
Honey baby thanks a lot

You wanted a fool, ah and I played the part
Now all I've got is a broken heart
We loved a little, ah we loved a lot
And you are gone gone gone
Honey thanks a lot, yeah I say
Thanks thanks thanks, ah thanks a lot
I got a broken heart
That's all I've got, you made me cry
Yes I cried a lot
And now you're gone gone gone
Baby thanks a lot
Thanks thanks thanks
Thanks a lot
Thanks you thank you thank you
Thanks a lot
