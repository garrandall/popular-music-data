Out of control
MMM - stick it where it hurts
Girl, I'll be peeling you off the ceiling. That's right Hee Hee
Ladies and gentlemen - Neneh Cherry

Well you laughed at me right in my face
At the wrong time and in the wrong place
You turned around and said "I'm all shook up"
Said to me "I'm your sweet buttercup" You're lying, you're lying,
Begging him to stay and crying
You're lying, you're lying, you're never satisfied

Heart, heart you can't break my heart
Hard, hard you think you're so hard
If you meant what you did it wouldn't been half as bad
But you did it in spite and that just isn't right

You took my man and didn't mean it
But you did it to hurt my feelings
What I should do is slap you in your face
You left me here with a pain below my waste
You lose a guy you move into the larder
You got no style, why don't you try a little harder
Chocolates, bananas, doughnuts and salami
Ain't gonna fit coz you're full of boloni

Heart, heart you can't break my heart
Hard, hard you think you're so hard
If you meant what you did it wouldn't been half as bad
But you did it in spite and that just isn't right

Only back alley rats take other peoples cats
And then strike back, that isn't where I'm at

Anyway, it's gonna get you anyway
Anyday, I'm gonna get you, get you

Heart, heart you can't break my heart
Hard, hard you think you're so hard
If you meant what you did it wouldn't been half as bad
But you did it in spite and that just isn't right
I thought you were my friend. God, you're just so digital girl.
You're like one of those cabbage patch creatures - DJ

You're burning the candle at both ends
You're gonna feel the heat
If everything you do comes back to you 
By now you'd be dead meat
You took my man and took his body
Strapped him to your bed just to have his baby
Everybody knows you're a phoney
You just want his alimony

Heart, heart you can't break my heart
Hard, hard you think you're so hard
If you meant what you did it wouldn't been half as bad
But you did it in spite and that just isn't right
