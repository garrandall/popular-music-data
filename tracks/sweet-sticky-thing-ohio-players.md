You just go from man to man
I just don't seem to understand
Why you're so very hard to take
You sweet sticky thing

If I could slow you down sometime
I'd like to try and change your mind
You're really not the one to blame
You sweet sticky thing

Sweet, sweet sticky thing
Sweet, sweet sticky thing
Sweet, sweet sticky thing
Sweet, sweet sticky thing
Sweet, sweet sticky thing
Sweet, sweet sticky thing

Every time that you walk by
You really leave me paralyzed
If you just wouldn't play those games
You sweet sticky thing

Your beehive is full of bees
I wish you had a place for me
I'm really trying hard to change
You sweet sticky thing

Sweet, sweet sticky thing
Sweet, sweet sticky thing
Sweet, sweet sticky thing
Sweet, sweet sticky thing
Sweet, sweet sticky thing
Sweet, sweet sticky thing

Little buzzin' bumble bee
I'd want to take you home with me
Will you share my beehive with me
You sweet sticky thing

You leave honey everywhere
Sometimes I wonder if you care
Who sees you when you do your thing
You've got such a sting

Sweet, sweet sticky thing
Sweet, sweet sticky thing
That's why I sing
Da da da daa
Da da da daa
Da da da daa ah

Da da da daa
Da da da daa
Da da da daa ah

Da da da daa
Da da da daa
Da dat da daa ah

Da da da daa
Da da da daa
Da da da daa ya
