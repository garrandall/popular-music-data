Ooooooh...mmm...mmm...
Extra! Extra!
I'm in love
I gotta thank my luck stars above
Hurry, hurry don't be late
Cause I can't wait
I gotta celebrate
It's a fact
We got a first rate act
It's evident when we make love
The main event
You're my every thought
You're my own attraction
You must be heaven's saint
You give me so much satisfaction
(You're the one)
You make life worth fighting for
You're the one-ah!
And there is nobody quite like you
Baby, you're the one...
Extra! Extra!
I'm in love
I gotta thank my luck stars above
Hurry, hurry don't be late
I can't wait
I gotta celebrate
It's a fact
We got a first rate act
It's evident when we make love
The main event
You're my everything
And it's my conclusion
There is no sweeter scent
When you have found the right solution
(You're the one)
You make life worth fighting for
You're the one-ah!
And there is nobody quite like you
Honey, you're the one
Extra! Extra!
I'm in love
I gotta thank my luck stars above
Hurry, hurry don't be late
I can't wait
I gotta celebrate
It's a fact
We got a first rate act
It's evident when we make love
The main event
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight for what you want
Fight for what you need
Fight to keep the one you love
With love you might succeed
(Fight!) Come on and fight!
(Fight!) Fight for what you want
Fight! Fight for what is real
Fight to keep the one you love
If love is what you feel
Love
Don't try to kick me when I'm down
No love-ah!
Cause I'm gonna lift you every round
(Keep it comin', keep it comin')
Look out kid cause I'm a-comin'
(Keep on tryin', keep on tryin')
You're a knockout
So put up your dukes and fight
(Fight! Fight!)
I said fight!
Love...
Don't try to kick me when I'm down
Love...
My feet are planted on the ground
Love...ah...ah!
You're gonna give up without a sound
(Keep it comin', keep it comin')
Look out kid cause love's a-comin'
(Keep on tryin', keep on tryin')
I'm a winner there's no denying
(Keep it goin', keep it goin')
You're a knockout
So put up your dukes and fight
Ah...Extra! Extra!
I'm in love
Hurry, hurry don't be late
Cause I can't wait
I gotta celebrate
It's a fact
We got a first rate act
It's evident when we make love...
Oh...Oh...Oh...

I'm gonna thank my luck stars above
(Hurry, hurry don't be late)
