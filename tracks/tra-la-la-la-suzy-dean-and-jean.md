Tra la la la Suzy
Tra la la la Suzy

Tra la la la Suzy
Tra la la la Suzy
Tra la la la Suzy
She's the girl for me

Oh, you love little Sue so
But you can't let Sue know
You're afraid little Suzy
Might turn her back on you

After school, you'll miss her
How you long to kiss her
She's the loveliest, prettiest
Sweetest little girl you ever knew

I call her
(Tra la la la Suzy)
Keep on calling her
(Tra la la la Suzy)

Don't quit calling her
Tra la la la Suzy
She's the girl for me

You get so discouraged
If you just had courage
Oh, you would ask little Suzy
To go out on a date

So today when you pass her
Then you oughta ask her
Yay, and I just hope you
Haven't waited too late

Today you're
(Tra la la la Suzy)
Keep on calling her
(Tra la la la Suzy)

Oh, don't quit calling her
Tra la la la Suzy
She's the girl for me

So you asked little Suzy
For a date for Tuesday
Oh, and she said, yes
What made you wait so long

And now her books, you'll carry
And pretty soon, you'll marry
Oh, yeah, you'll go through life
And keep on singing this song

I love my
(Tra la la la Suzy)
Keep on calling her
(Tra la la la Suzy)

Oh, don't quit calling her
Tra la la la Suzy
She's the girl for me

I love my
(Tra la la la Suzy)
Oh, keep on calling her
(Tra la la la Suzy)

Don't quit calling her
Tra la la la Suzy
She's the girl for me
