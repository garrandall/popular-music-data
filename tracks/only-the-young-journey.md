Another night in any town
You can hear the thunder of their cry
Ahead of their time
They wonder why

In the shadows of a golden age
A generation waits for dawn
Brave carry on
Bold and the strong


Only the young can say
They're free to fly away
Sharing the same desires
Burning like wildfire


They are seeing through the promises
And all the lies they dare to tell
Is it heaven or hell?
They know very well


Only the young can say
They're free to fly away
Sharing the same desires
Burning like wildfire




Only the young can say
They're free to fly away
Sharing the same desires
Burning like wildfire


Only the young can say
Only the young can say (young can say)
Only the young can say
Only the young can say (young can say)
Only the young can say
