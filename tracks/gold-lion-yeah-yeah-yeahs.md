Gold Lion's gonna tell me where the light is
Gold Lion's gonna tell me where the light is
Take our hands out of control
Take our hands out of control


Now, tell me what you saw
Tell me what you saw
There was a crowd of seeds
Inside, outside
I must have done a dozen each
It was the height I grew
The weight, the shell was crushing you
I've been around a few
Tell me what you saw
I'll tell you what to
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ohh ohh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ohh ohh


Gold Lion's gonna tell me where the light is
Gold Lion's gonna tell me where the light is
Take our hands out of control
Take our hands out of control


Outside, Inside
This is a moon without a tide
We'll build a fire in your eyes
We'll build a fire
When the cover's getting brighter, cold desire
Makes a moon without a tide


Tell me what you saw
I'll tell you what to
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ohh ohh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ohh ohh


Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ohh ohh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ohh ohh
