She's a very freaky gurl, don't bring her to mama
First you get her name then you get her number
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer

She's a very freaky gurl, she get it from her momma
First you get her name then you get her number
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer

Gucci can't ding a ling, bet I make your back hurt
Bet I make your cat squirt, bet I make your neck jerk
Called Lil' Kim, told her, better wear a tight skirt
Bet I know you're tight work, bet I make ya cum first

Gucci mane, yeah, bet we make a sex tape
Flood it on the internet, put it on my Myspace
Gucci got a big stick, make ya sing my ad libs, yeah
But you gotta be a queen bitch
(Gucci)

So icy trap star, fuck her like a porn star
On my H2 then I fucked her in her own car
Face down, ass up, I'ma make her love me
Probably don't love me but let her suck and fuck me

Gucci wanna sex ya, tell me is ya itched it
Probably could'a hit it, dawg, I ain't even hit it yet
Fuck the 20 minutes, dawg, I ain't even nutted yet
Now, she braggin' on me, dawg, I ain't even stuntin' it

She's a very freaky gurl, don't bring her to mama
First you get her name then you get her number
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer

I'm a very freaky gurl, very freaky gurl, gurl
Very freaky gurl, very freaky gurl, gurl
Very freaky gurl, very freaky gurl, gurl, yeah

Oh, you want a freaky gurl? Welcome to Kim's World
You ain't gon' wanna leave, just like a kid at DisneyWorld
My deep throat'll have you squirtin' like a water-gun
Coochie overflowin' like somebody let the faucet run

Bust one nut, I ain't done, I got more cum
Friends? Tell' 'em all to come, we gon' have some mo' fun
Yeah, chew on me like some bubblegum
I'll lick you like a lollipop once you taste my honeybun

It's our lil' secret, just like my underwear
You know pain is pleasure, can you make me shed a tear?
Smack my ass, grab my neck, got 'em cummin' everywhere
I'ma freak, so I don't care, just don't get none in my hair

Now, he callin' me wifey and he wanna introduce me
Takin' me on shoppin' sprees, he wanna buy me Gucci
Zoomin' like a bootsy on the back of his Suzuki
And I ain't even sex him, all I did was let him eat my coochie

Ha, ha, ha, okay, it's Gucci
Yeah, Lil' Kim

She's a very freaky gurl, she get it from her mama
First you get her name then you get her number
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer

Luda, I got sum brain, up in the front seat of the hummer
And if you can make it rain then Ludacris can make it thunder
I ain't messin' with these lames but it seem to make 'em wonder
How I came and took the game fo' the past seven summers?

Now your woman wanna get it from the front, from the back
If she with it, I'm a hit it from the side
Give her what she wants in the lac
She a freaky and I can see it in her eyes

She can go tit for tat, it's so good that I made her wanna cry
A little bit of this, a little that for a two piece biscuit and sum fries
Straight from churches, ya boyfriend's worthless
'Cause Luda goes deep while he barely scratch the surface

She itching for a scratch like she DJ JC
If you looking for ya match, bitch, come and find me

I be in the A town, I ain't that hard to find
Put ya legs up in the air and see the DTP sign
If ya wanna meet my mama, that's a thing I won't do
You say muthafuck me, nah, muthafuck you, kno' why?

'Cause she's a very freaky gurl, don't bring her to mama
First you get her name then you get her number
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer

I'm a very freaky gurl, very freaky gurl, gurl
Very freaky gurl, very freaky gurl, gurl
Very freaky gurl, very freaky gurl, gurl
Very freaky gurl, very freaky gurl, gurl
