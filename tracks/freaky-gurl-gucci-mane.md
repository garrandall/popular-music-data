(Yeaa!)
Yeaa! Yeaa!
Yeaa! Yeaa!
Yeaa! Yeaa!
Yeaa!
She's a very freaky girl
Very freaky girl
Gucci, I want a very freaky girl


She's a very freaky girl (yeaa!), don't bring her to mama (mama!)
First you get her name (name), then you get her number (number!)
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer (yeaa!)
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer (yeaa!)
She's a very freaky girl (yeaa!), don't bring her to mama (mama!)
First you get her name (name), then you get her number (number!)
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer (yeaa!)
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer (yeaa!)
Uh


Let me set the record straight:
Hater: you participate
3 girls with me like I'm going on Elimidate
Say you got a man, but your man ain't here
The ice in my ear shine like a chandelier
Jumping out the phantom, don't you think I'm handsome?
Watch on my wrist cost more than a mansion
Bet your baby-daddy ain't icing like the kid be
Got your baby mama front seat of the Ferrari


She's a very freaky girl (yeaa!), don't bring her to mama (mama!)
First you get her name (name), then you get her number (number!)
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer (yeaa!)
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer (yeaa!)
She's a very freaky girl (yeaa!), don't bring her to mama (mama!)
First you get her name (name), then you get her number (number!)
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer (yeaa!)
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer (yeaa!)
Uh


Gucci Mane La Flare. Baby, I'm that guy
Girls' eyeballs pop when they see when my Lamb' pass by
My money long as a limo
Just to show off, I put my wrist out the window
Ride through the 6, little kids scream "bingo!"
I fell off in the spotlight, like ay, let's mingle
Then the DJ play my new single
The club got crazy, all the hoes went psycho


She's a very freaky girl (yeaa!), don't bring her to mama (mama!)
First you get her name (name), then you get her number (number!)
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer (yeaa!)
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer (yeaa!)
She's a very freaky girl (yeaa!), don't bring her to mama (mama!)
First you get her name (name), then you get her number (number!)
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer (yeaa!)
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer (yeaa!)
Uh


Don't be conceited, girl
I know you're freaky, girl
I know your secret, girl
But I'm gonna keep it, girl
Oh, you's a college girl?
Come be a Gucci girl
Oh, you's a Gucci fan?
Let's go to Gucciland
You dig a Gucci man
Cause only Gucci can
Drop a stack, pop your back with a rubberband
You diggin Gucci, Gucci
Let's do the oochie-coochie
Oh, that's your girlfriend?
Why don't you introduce me


She's a very freaky girl (yeaa!), don't bring her to mama (mama!)
First you get her name (name), then you get her number (number!)
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer (yeaa!)
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer (yeaa!)
She's a very freaky girl (yeaa!), don't bring her to mama (mama!)
First you get her name (name), then you get her number (number!)
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer (yeaa!)
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer (yeaa!)
Uh
