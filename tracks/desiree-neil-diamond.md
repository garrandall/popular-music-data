It was the third of June,
On that summer's day
When I became a man
At the hands of a girl almost twice my age

And she came to me
Just like a morning sun
And it wasn't so much her words as such
As the way they were sung
It was the way they were sung

Desiree
Oh, Desiree
There I was found
By the sweet passion sound
Of your loving song
Time was right, the night was long

Remember, Desiree
Oh, Desiree
Somehow I knew
I could only have you 'til the morning light
If only for that single night
Sweet Desiree, you made it right

Then came the fourth of June,
On that sleepless night
Well I tossed and I turned
While the thought of her burned
Up and down my mind

For she was there and gone
Without one regret
But she continues on
Like the words of a song
I could not forget, I could not forget

Desiree
Oh, Desiree
There I was found
By the sweet passion sound
Of your loving song
Time was right, the night was long

Remember Desiree
Oh, Desiree
And though somehow I knew
I could only have you 'til the morning light
The night was long, the time was right

Do you remember, Desiree
Oh, Desiree

Do you remember,
Desiree
