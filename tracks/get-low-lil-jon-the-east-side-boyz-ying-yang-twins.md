3, 6, 9 - damn you fine
Hoping she can sock it to me one more time
Get low (get low) get low (get low)
Get low (get low) get low (get low)
To the window (to the window)
To the wall (to the wall)
'Til the sweat drop down my balls (my balls)
'Til all these bitches crawl (crawl)
'Til all skeet skeet mo'fuckas, all skeet skeet god damn! (mo'fuckas!)
Til all skeet skeet mo'fuckas, all skeet skeet god damn! (I got down)


Shorty crunk, so fresh, so clean
Can she fuck? That question been harassing me
In the mind, this bitch is fine
I done came to the club about 50 11 times
Now can I play with your panty line?
The club owner said I need to calm down
Security guard go to sweating me now
Nigga drunker than a motherfucker, threaten me now


She getting crunk in the club, I mean she work it
And I like to see the females twerking
Taking her clothes off - fuckin' naked
ATL - ho, don't disrespect it
P-pop your pussy like this
Cause Yin Yang Twins in this B-I-itch
Lil Jon and the East Side Boys with me
And we all like to see ass and titties
Now bring your ass over here, ho
And let me see you get low if you want this thug
Now take it to the floor and if your ass want to act
You can keep your ass where you're at


3, 6, 9 - damn you fine
Hoping she can sock it to me one more time
Get low (get low) get low get low!
To the window, to the wall!
Til the sweat drop down my balls
Til all these bitches crawl
Til all skeet skeet mo'fuckas, all skeet skeet god damn! (mo'fuckas!)
Til all skeet skeet mo'fuckas, all skeet skeet god damn! (I got down)


Let me see you get low (you scared!)
Drop that ass to the floor (You scared!)
Drop that ass ey, shake it fast ey
Pop that ass to the left and the right ey
Drop that ass ey, shake it fast ey
Pop that ass to the left and the right ey
Now back, back, back it up
Now stop (oh!) then wiggle with it (yea!)


3, 6, 9 - damn you fine
Hoping she can sock it to me one more time
Get low, get low, get low get low!
To the window, to the wall!
Til the sweat drop down my balls
Til all these bitches crawl
Til all skeet skeet mo'fuckas, all skeet skeet god damn! (mo'fuckas!)
Til all skeet skeet mo'fuckas, all skeet skeet god damn! (I got down)


Now give me my dub back and go get your friend
Stupid bitch standing there while I'm drinking my Hen
Steady looking at me still asking questions
Time's up, nigga, pass me another contestant
Ho move to the left if you ain't bout 50
Done talked through 3 or 4 songs already
Looking at a nigga with your palm out
Bitch, I ain't even seen you dance!
Twerk something baby, work something baby
Pop your pussy on the pole, do your thang baby
Slide down that bitch a little bit then stop
Get back on the floor, catch your balance then drop
Now bring it back up, clap your ass like hands
I just wanna see your ass dirty dance
Yin Yang we done done again
And put it on the map like "hah?!"


3, 6, 9 - damn you fine
Hoping she can sock it to me one more time
Get low, get low, get low get low!
To the window, to the wall!
Til the sweat drop down my balls
Til all these bitches crawl
Til all skeet skeet mo'fuckas, all skeet skeet god damn! (mo'fuckas!)
Til all skeet skeet mo'fuckas, all skeet skeet god damn! (I got down)


Ya'll twerking a little bit ladies
But you got to twerk a little bit harder than that
Right now, I need all the ladies that know they look good tonight
We want y'all to do this shit like this:
Bend over to the front, touch your toes!
Back that ass up and down and get low
Bend over to the front, touch your toes!
Back that ass up and down and get low


3-6-9, damn, she fine
Hoping she can sock it to me one more time
Get low (get low) get low (get low)
Get low (get low) get low (get low)
To the window (to the window)
To the wall (to the wall)
'Til the sweat drop down my balls (my balls)
'Til all these bitches crawl (crawl)
'Til all skeet-skeet, mothafucka (mothafucka!)
All skeet-skeet, goddamn (goddamn!)
'Til all skeet-skeet, mothafucka (mothafucka!)
All skeet-skeet, goddamn (goddamn!)
