You're not the type, type of girl to remain
With the guy, with the guy 
Too shy, too afraid to say he'll give his heart to you forever
I'm not the boy who will fall to his knees
With his hands clasped tight
Begging, begging you please
To stay with him for worse or for better

But I'm staring at you now
There's no one else around
I'm thinking you're the girl for me


I'm just saying it's fine by me
If you never leave
And we can lay like this forever
It's fine by me

In the past I would try
Try hard to commit to a girl
Wouldn't get too far
It always somehow seemed to fall apart

But with you, you, you
I can see what I need
I can dream realistically
I knew that this was different from the start

And it seems that every time
We're eye to eye
I can find another piece of you
That I don't wanna lose

And I'm staring at you now
There's no one else around
I'm thinking you're the girl I need


I'm just saying it's fine by me
If you never leave
And we can lay like this forever
It's fine by me
I'm just saying it's fine by me
If you never leave
And we can lay like this forever
It's fine by me

And it's never easy
Darling, believe me
I'm as skeptical as you
When I think of life without "us"
It seems like "What we're supposed to do? "
But I don't wanna come on too strong


I'm just saying it's fine by me
If you never leave
We can lay like this forever
It's fine by me
It's fine by me
If you never leave
And we can lay like this forever
It's fine by me
I'm just saying it's fine by me
If we never leave
And we can lay like this forever
It's fine by me
