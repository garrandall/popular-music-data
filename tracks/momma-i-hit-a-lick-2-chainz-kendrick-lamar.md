(I want it, I want it, I want it)

(Chili, chili, chili, chili)
(Way up countin' chili)
(I'm up countin' chili)
(Tell my momma I hit a lick)
(Tell my momma I hit a lick)
(Momma, I hit a lick)
(Momma, I hit a lick)

I'm coming, baby, send the address
Progress, never digress
Your last man didn't pass the 'fly test'
I eat rappers, no digest
Fuck a piece, I want the whole pie graph
Money taller than a giraffe
Feng shui by the mic stand
Have you ever had two one-night stands?
I'm an emperor, very sinister
Someone smoking on indica
Fox on me like Vivica
I pray before a meal, spiritual

brought a case, bought a big face
They want my spot, they wanna switch place
They want the game, wanna sip Ace
Bow, bow, straight to the face
I'm takin' my lawyer, the whole briefcase
Makin' a play in the police face
They were like, "Man, he fresh"
I was like, "Go DJ"
When they play your new shit
I was like, "No DJ!"
You can go on and skip that
I buy a house and flip that

(Chili, chili, chili, chili)
(Way up countin' chili)
(I'm up countin' chili)
(Tell my momma I hit a lick)
(Tell my momma I hit a lick)
(Momma, I hit a lick)
(Momma, I hit a lick)

Fall off in this bitch, I ball off in this bitch
My commas hit the floor, you crawl off in this bitch
I do a hundred more, you stall off in this bitch
And then I vÃ¡manos, applaud me in this bitch
C-notes, vinos Pinots all up in this bitch
MaÃ±ana in this bitch, y'all are not familiar
Y'all are immigrants, the law not in this bitch, I

Fuck the opp, no competitor
got into it with my bitch last night
She was right, but I had to get at her
Two popped bands and they dance on my waist
Hit the face, that's the editor
I don't take pics on a jet, lil' nigga
This shit regular
G-5's all in my back yard
Situated crew in the nose bleed
And my pockets holdin' big protein
Big, big protein

I levelled up past 5-5
Your favorite rapper Desperate Housewives
Play with me get your chastised
Milk 'em all 'til I'm satisfied

Get involved 'fore I strategize
Switch the flow 'cause I know niggas like identity theft
Oh you got like me? (Say less)
Oh, you pop like me? (Say less)
Mask keep a nigga (In Check)
Huh, swag keep a nigga (With checks)
Huh, tags on my wall (Success)
Huh, played the underdog, now I flex

(Chili, chili, chili, chili)
(Way up countin' chili)
(I'm up countin' chili)
(Tell my momma I hit a lick)
(Tell my momma I hit a lick)
(Momma, I hit a lick)
