"Maybe, just maybe
Naughty girls need love too."

I've been told time and time again
That you can't treat love like a game
But I play rough with hearts that never mend
'Cause some guys like you do the same
Love was just a four letter word
Never heard how absurd it could be
But now I can't believe this is real
How I feel now you steal
My heart away from me

Used to be so good and so bad
Sex was something I just had
Used to always know what to do
Now you've got me confused

Baby don't let me be misunderstood
Temporary love's so bad but if feels so good
Then along came you
Now I know its true
Naughty girls need love too
Then came you, then came you

Yes, it's true
I'm in love with you
And believe it baby this time
Your love won't get away
Stay here in the place to be
We can get busy my way
For six forevers and a day-ay-ay
Ooh it's only you I adore
So much more than my body
Was asking for
Yes your love is breaking my chill
Even still there's a thrill
In my heart

"Samantha Fox was such a wild dame
Huh but what's in a name
(S-S-Samantha, S-S-Samantha)
No more fun and games of the mind
Let's get busy one more time."
