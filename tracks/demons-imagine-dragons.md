Born sinner, half nigga with a ER
Traveling local, no agent or PR
This big room in a house with no one to share it with
If she was alive, I swear to God, I'd move my grandma in
Lost focus, trying to mend this broken heart
Writing words on my phone and hopes it will show my art
The older that we get, the more we grow apart
It was built on a lie, we came from a hopeless start
And I'm not supposed to rap about my feelings, never
Supposed to make a lot of jokes and say some shit that's clever
And act like I'm balling and fucking bitches
Man, fake it till you make it's gotta be the worst expression ever
I'd rather only portray the things that are real
Even if that shit does cost me a record deal
And you could say that I'm stupid or say I'm foolish
But I'm living off this music, I'll never know how your desk will feel


And I'm just fighting off my demons (Fighting off my demons)
I'm fighting off my demons (Fighting off my demons)
I thank the fans for telling me I'm the man
I'm just glad I can finally give you something to believe in
And I'm fighting off my demons (Fighting off my demons)
I'm fighting off my demons (Fighting off my demons)
I wanna thank the fans for accepting who I am
Understand you're the reason why I'm breathing


I put that gun to my head and then I put it down
I threw it in the river, let the bullets drown
I'm known as this funny I'll go and rapper guy
But really, you don't know what goes on when you're not around
And then I thought about it, a selfish sacrifice
The afterlife, if heaven's real then would I go there?
And then I thought about the shit me and my friends did
If I do make it, there'll be nobody I know there
And I'm fighting off these tears, but I'm failing
Every time I feel like I'm better, I fucking relapse
I'm spitting image of my dad, I used to think that was a bad thing
But now I'm not even ashamed to be that
A good man who made mistakes just like the rest of us
Life is short, look at the time that he invest in us
We've had our differences, people change with the seasons
We fighting off all our demons and let you pick up what's left of us
