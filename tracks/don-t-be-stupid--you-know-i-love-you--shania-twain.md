Cool
Yeah
Uh-uh, yeah


You're so complicated
You hang over my shoulder when I read my mail
I don't appreciate it
When I talk to other guys
You think they're on my tail
I get so aggravated when I get off the phone
And get the third degree
I'm really feelin' frustrated
Why don't you take a pill and put a little trust in me?
And you'll see


Don't freak out until you know the facts
Relax


Don't be stupid, you know I love you
Don't be ridiculous, you know I need you
Don't be absurd, you know I want you
Don't be impossible


I'm mad about you (I'm mad about you)
Can't live without you (Can't live without you)
I'm crazy about you (I'm crazy about you)
So don't be stupid, you know I love you


Stop overreacting
You even get suspicious when I paint my nails
It's definitely distracting
The way you dramatize every little small detail


Don't freak out until you know the facts
Relax, max


Don't be stupid, you know I love you
Don't be ridiculous, you know I need you
Don't be absurd, you know I want you
Don't be impossible
No, no, no


I'm mad about you (I'm mad about you)
I can't live without you (Can't live without you)
I'm crazy about you (I'm crazy about you)
So don't be stupid, you know I love you


Don't be stupid
My baby


I'm mad about you (I'm mad about you)
I can't live without you (Can't live without you)
I'm crazy about you (I'm crazy about you)
So don't be stupid, you know I love you


Don't be stupid, you know I love you
Don't be ridiculous, you know I need you
Don't be absurd, you know I want you
Don't be impossible, impossible
Oh, no, no, no


Don't be, don't be, don't be, baby
Don't be ridiculous
No, no
Oh, don't be stupid
