The broken clock is a comfort, it helps me sleep tonight
Maybe it can stop tomorrow from stealing all my time
I am here still waiting though I still have my doubts
I am damaged at best, like you've already figured out


I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart that's still beating
In the pain, there is healing
In your name I find meaning


So I'm holding on, I'm holding on, I'm holding on
I'm barely holding on to you


The broken locks were a warning you got inside my head
I tried my best to be guarded, I'm an open book instead
I still see your reflection inside of my eyes
That are looking for a purpose, they're still looking for life


I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart that's still beating
In the pain, is there healing?
In your name I find meaning


So I'm holding on, I'm holding on, I'm holding on
I'm barely holding on to you


I'm hanging on another day
Just to see what you throw my way
And I'm hanging on to the words you say
You said that I will be okay


The broken lights on the freeway left me here alone
I may have lost my way now, haven't forgotten my way home


I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart that's still beating
In the pain, there is healing
In your name I find meaning


So I'm holding on, I'm holding on, I'm holding on
I'm barely holding on to you
