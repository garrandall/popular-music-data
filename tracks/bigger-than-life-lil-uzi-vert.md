Let's go, let's go
Lil Uzi Vert
Let's go, let's go (I'm Working on Dying)
Not playin', oh-oh
(One, two) Let's go (One, two, three)
Alright now (Yeah)

I done made so many millions
Ain't nothin' to think about
And she fuck with me because I am the one
That still come back even though I made it out (Yeah)
I thought she was G, when I put in my dick
She was screamin', she said, "Come on, take it out"
And loyalty, I swear that's everything
And for me, got niggas that's gon' kill it off (Yeah)
And when I do a show, it's a hundred thousand
What the venue probably was just payin' out
And she know he a bum, so his girlfriend with me
And you know at late night she be stayin' out
I ain't do it on purpose, oops, my bad, I didn't mean
There goes the reason he hatin' now
Got a V12 that's all on my engine
That's prolly the reason that my head be racin' off (Vroom)

I'm too evil, too evil, too evil, too evil
It's nobody out here can save me now (Woah)
I remember when I was younger
My girl ain't answer my phone and listen to "Take You Down" (Woah)
My diamonds, they dance like Chris Brown
Look at my wrist, it's lit now (Woah)
My niggas shootin' them rounds (Bah)
Fuck nigga better get down (Duck down) (Let's go)
I'm not worried 'bout no niggas
These niggas, they fake, these niggas they hate
These niggas they all, all perpetrate
These niggas ain't really with all the shits
These niggas, they walk around with dirty sticks
When I shoot two, I shoot a nigga his shit (Yeah)
I don't play with niggas, these niggas, they hoes
I just do everything then, I suppose (Let's go)
These niggas, they is really not my bros (No)
These niggas, they my foes (Yeah, yeah)
I ran out of space, put diamonds that's all on my toes
I'm switchin' my hoes, same way I'm switchin' my clothes (Yeah)
Rockstar goals, septum all on my nose (Yeah, goals)

I done made so many millions
Ain't nothin' to think about
And she fuck with me because I am the one
That still come back even though I made it out
I thought she was G, when I put in my dick
She was screamin', she said, "Come on, take it out"
And loyalty, I swear that's everything
And for me, got niggas that's gon' kill it off
And when I do a show, it's a hundred thousand
What the venue probably was just payin' out
And she know he a bum, so his girlfriend with me
And you know at late night she be stayin' out
I ain't do it on purpose, oops, my bad, I didn't mean
There goes the reason he hatin' now
Got a V12 that's all on my engine
That's prolly the reason that my head be racin' off

Walked in and I had to go get a bag
Walked in and had to go get a big bag (Yeah)
Brought the big bag for the brand new bae
Why the fuck would I care what you say? (Amen)
Had a fuck nigga head like a toup√©e (What?)
Okay, they wanna see a new wave (Yah)
Made two hundred racks in two days (Check it out)
My diamonds they cooler than Cool J (Yah)
No, no, your swag don't move me (No)
That's not a new Rollie, that's a new face (What?)
Spent fifty racks in Gucci
Spent eighty racks in Louis (Let's go)
Okay, my life is great (Yeah)
Walk around with a whole lotta oochie (Let's go)
On the sides, got a fade like Boosie
Hand wet, I ain't playin' with her coochie (Oh)
I don't know why these niggas be playin'
I don't know why these niggas be watchin' (I don't know, I don't know)
I don't know why these niggas be clockin' (I don't know)
That's why I got time for you (Who?)
'Cause a nigga like me, I'm not watchin'
'Cause a nigga like me, I'm not clockin' (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, a nigga like me fill my pocket (Fill my pocket)
Yeah, a nigga like me be show-stoppin' (Let's go) (Yeah, yeah)

I done made so many millions
Ain't nothin' to think about (Yeah, yeah)
And she fuck with me because I am the one
That still come back even though I made it out (Yeah)
I thought she was G, when I put in my dick
She was screamin', she said, "Come on, take it out"
And loyalty, I swear that's everything
And for me, got niggas that gon' kill it off (What?)
And when I do a show, it's a hundred thousand
What the venue probably was just payin' out
And she know he a bum, so his girlfriend with me
And you know at late night she be stayin' out
I ain't do it on purpose, oops, my bad, I didn't mean
There goes the reason he hatin' now
Got a V12 that's all on my engine
That's prolly the reason that my head be racin' off
