It's perfect outside. It's like God let me dial up the weather.
Got the whole crew here, I ain't seen some of them in forever.
It's one of those never-forget-it-better-stop-and-take-it-in kinda scenes.
Everything's just right, yeah, except for one thing.

You should be here, standing with your arm around me here.
Cutting up, cracking a cold beer, saying cheers, hey y'all it's sure been a good year.
It's one of those moments, that's got your name written all over it.
And you know that if I had just one wish it'd be that you didn't have to miss this
You should be here.

You'd be taking way too many pictures on your phone.
Showing them off to everybody that you know back home.
And even some you don't, yeah
They say now you're in a better place
And I would be too if I could see your face.

You should be here, standing with your arm around me here.
Cutting up, cracking a cold beer, saying cheers, hey, y'all it's sure been a good year.
It's one of those moments, that's got your name written all over it.
And you know that if I had just one wish it'd be that you didn't have to miss this.
Aw you should be here.

You'd be loving this, you'd be freaking out, you'd be smiling, yeah
I know you'd be all about what's going on right here right now.
God, I wish somehow you could be here.

Oh, you should be here.

Yeah, this is one of those moments that's got your name written all over it
And you know that if I had just one wish it'd be that you didn't have to miss this.
Aw you should be here.
You should be here.
