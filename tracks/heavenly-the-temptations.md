So you're through with love
And you say
It's just a waste of time
(Waste of time you blew your mind)
There are two sides to love
And if you will
I'd like to show you mine
Girl, love has it's ups and downs
It's sometimes like a merry go round
Going round and around and around and around
Never knowing where you're bound
I may not be the one you want
But I'm sure the one you need
Give me a chance to prove
Love shared by me and you can be


Heavenly
Heavenly
Heavenly
(That's how)
That's how love is when it's right it's right
(Simply)
Heavenly
Heavenly
Heavenly
(That's how)
That's how love is when it's right


Hey girl, be fair to your heart
Don't turn your back on love
(Don't turn your back on love)
No, no, 'cause love is the one thing everybody needs
(Everybody needs love)
Hey girl, open up your heart again
Please, won't you let me in
Give me a chance to undo, all the hurt he's put you through
I may not be the one you want
But I'm sure the one you need
Girl, give me a chance and you'll see
Sharing your love with me will be


Heavenly
Heavenly
Heavenly
(That's how)
That's how love is when it's right
(I know, I know it's gonna be)
Heavenly
Heavenly
Heavenly
That's how love is when it's right


Oh girl
Hey girl, give love another try
Oh, love can pass you by
Love can be


Heavenly
Heavenly
Heavenly
(Hey girl)
That's how love is when it's right
Heavenly
Heavenly
Heavenly
(Hey girl)
That's how love is when it's right
(Love can be, love can be)
Heavenly
Heavenly
Heavenly
(Hey girl)
That's how love is when it's right

That's how love is when it's right
