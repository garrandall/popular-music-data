I hope you think of me
I hope you think of me
I hope you think of me
I hope you think of me

He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
Hope you think of me
I hope you think of me
I hope you think of me
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
Hope you think of me
I hope you think of me
Won't you think of me
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:
"When you think Tim McGraw
Hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place"

When you think happiness
Hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
Hope you think of me
I hope you think of me
I hope you think of me
Won't you think of me
I hope you think of me
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
I hope you think of me
You think of me

He said the way my blue eyes shine
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
