Passenger side, I slide on in
Vinyl seats hot from the heat of the sun
Chewin' on a Slim Jim, can't stop 
thinkin' about him
Yeah, yeah, yeah he's the one
Yeah, yeah, yeah he's the one


Ooo life's so sweet right here in the 
passenger seat
Ooo yeah life's so sweet
When I look to my left, see his 
suntanned hands
His muddy river hair and his 
thousand-acre plans
I'm all shook up like a quarter in a can
Ain't life sweet in the passenger seat

I daydream of me and a cold cotton pillow
And the feel of his skin
The windowsill smiles and before I know 
it I'm miles 
Away sittin' next to him
Miles away sittin' next to him




Shiftin' those gears baby, one, two, three
Then he shifts those ocean eyes back to me
Can't imagine a moment any better than this
Then we kiss

Ooo Life's so sweet right here in the 
passenger seat
Ooo yeah, life's so sweet
Ooo life's so sweet right here in the 
passenger seat
Ooo yeah life's so sweet, it's life's so sweet
It's life's so sweet, it's so sweet in the 
passenger seat

Life's so, life's so
Life's so sweet
Sweet right here, right here
