A CHANGE IS GONNA COME

PEOPLE GOTTA BE FREE

All the world knows
It's so easy to see
People everywhere
Just want to be free
Listen, please, listen
That's the way it should be
Peace in the valley
People got to be free, now
I want to be free, now
Now come on
All the world
All the world knows
It's easy to see
People everywhere
People everywhere
Just want to be free
Can't understand
Can't understand
So simple to me
People everywhere
People everywhere
Just got to be free
Got to, got to be free
Listen, oh shout it
From the mountains
Shout it from the mountains
And out to the sea
No two ways about it
No two ways about it
People have to be free
That's my opinion
That opinion will be
That's the situation
For a man to be free
Oh, come on
Oh, got to be free
Yeah, yeah, oh
Oh, what a feeling
Just come over me
Not to lose nothing
Let a black man see
Everybody's dancing
Come on, let's go see
Peace in the valley
People got to be free, oh
Come on
That's what I'm talkin' about
Uh, huh, let me hear you try it one time
Come on people, gotta be free
I want to be free
Gotta be free, oh
So you better see
(Gotta be free)
People everywhere
(Gotta be free)
They just got to be free
(Gotta be free)
Oh, what a feeling
(Gotta be free)
Come over me
(Gotta be free)
I'd love to move a mountain
So the black man can see
(Free)
All the world over
(Gotta be free)
Gotta be free
Gotta be free
Gotta be free...
