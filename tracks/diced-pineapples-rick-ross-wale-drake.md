Diced pineapple,
Tonight you shall reach a height that the sky won't catch you
The highest form of my admiration
I ain't no connoisseur but I'm kinda sure you will admire my taste
And before the sun graze you

I'm tryna see how deep you are
And believe me shorty I ain't talking about no intimate conversation
I wanna see if I can make you reach things unobtainable
When I peek into your nature
And I promise you my goals will exceed any physical pleasure
I wanna give you what's better than better

The better my effort, the wetter her treasure
The more these mere moments seem like heavens or temporary forevers
Shorty get it together
Diced pineapple

May your love come down so my mind might have you
You designed my imagination
Let me redefine foreplay so you need five and
Tell me shorty you got it baby
If it's not it baby,
Hope it's progress baby
Let it all drip baby
If you stop that shaking,
No more talking baby,
No more talking baby


Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples, damn, my baby tastes the best
I nearly lost my mind, guess it was a test
Swept her off her feet and went and bought her ass a Lex

Paid it off cash so I never wrote a cheque
Leave my cars at her crib I'm just stuntin' on her ex
Pussy's excellent and I know it sound a mess
I love to make her toes curl as I'm lickin' on her flesh uh

Sex all night, couple shots of CÃROC
Crib on the water, got LeBron up the block
Money ain't a thing, baby welcome to the mob
Diced pineapples talking diamonds by the jar

Bitch so bad got me wishing I could sing her
Uniform Isabel Marant when you on the team
Double MG them other niggas fell off,
Baby girl I just wanna see you well off


Call me crazy shit at least you're calling
Feels better when you let it out don't it girl
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it 'cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right


Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples I just bought my girl a set
I know my lifestyle wild, I do it for the set
She know how to make me smile and she do it with the sex

Pop bottles, make love, Thug Passion,
Red bottoms, Moncler, high fashion
Belt buckles, door handles, gold-plated,
Balmain rich denim, out Vegas

French Riviera baby girl lets take a trip
I'm 'a trip go to Cannes France to catch a flick
Baby listen, this position is a blessing and with your permission
Hopefully you'll learn a lesson

I'm so fly that I shouldn't even walk.
She so fine she ain't even gotta talk
Diced pineapples talking diamonds by the jar
She never wrote a song but I know that she's a star


Call me crazy shit at least you're calling
Feels better when you let it out don't it girl
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it 'cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right


Something about her probably can't live without her
Roll up some sour, let me kiss on a fountain
Mission accomplished, you increasing your heart rate
And I won't ever rest we meet at the peak of your mountain

Eager to show you, thinking that I should know you
And you eager to work perfect, I can employ you
Designer shit spoil you, rub you down with the oil
To get on a higher tree, gonna have to climb a sequoia

Hol' up, showing off some Agent Provocateur
Rushing you out your draws, though patiently get you off
Hate when they get too anxious though, hate when they get too dull
Like to go deep but I hate to get too deeply involved

How sweet is you, let me see some proof
Fuck making pussy talk, I like to make it sing a tune
All we need is we, we don't need no room
Right now I'm tryna eat, and we don't need a spoon


Call me crazy shit at least you're calling
Feels better when you let it out don't it girl
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it 'cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
