I can tell by the look in your eyes 
You've been hurtin 
You know I'll never let you down oh, no 
And I'll try anything to keep it workin 
You gave me time to find out 
What my heart was lookin for 
And what I'm feelin inside 

In your eyes 
I want to see your love again 
In your eyes 
I never want this feeling to end 
It took some time to find the light 
But now I realize 
I can see the heaven in your eyes 

Can't you see I'm finding it hard to let go oooh 
All the heartaches we've been through 
I never really thought I'd see this love grow 
But you helped me see 
Now I know what my heart's been lookin for 
And what I'm feeling inside 

In your eyes 
I want to see your love again 
In your eyes 
I never want this feeling to end 
It took some time to find the light 
But now I realize 
I can see the heaven in your eyes 

We've been livin on the edge 
Where only the strong survive 
We've been livin on the edge 
And it's something that we just can't hide 
Oh this feeling inside 

In your eyes 
I want to see your love again 
In your eyes 
I never want this feeling to end 
It took some time to find the light 
But now I realize 
I can see the heaven in your eyes 
Oh yeah, I can see the heaven in your eyes 
Oh yeah, I can see the heaven in your eyes 
I can see the heaven in your eyes 
Heaven in your eyes oh 
Heaven in your eyes 
I can see the heaven, heaven in your eyes 
Heaven in your eyes
