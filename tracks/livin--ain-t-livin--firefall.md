All the empty words I've spoken
All the promises I've broken
All the lovers and the loves I've pushed away
Now they all come back to haunt me
And the silence seem to taunt me
'Cause they turned the tables round the other way

Livin' is easy with someone who cares
Someone to call you their own
Livin' is lovely with somebody there
Livin' ain't livin' alone ain't livin' alone

Did I turn my back so coldly
On the ones who trie to hold me
Saying only that I needed to be free
Now I know some dreams were shattered
Because I never thought it mattered
No I never thought of anything but me

Livin' is easy with someone who cares
Someone to call you their own
Livin' is lovely with somebody there
Livin' ain't livin' alone ain't livin' alone

Have I taken all my chances
Will there be no more romances
Did I make my choice and never even know
But I'm much too young for endings
So I have to keep pretending
That tomorrow is the day my love will show
