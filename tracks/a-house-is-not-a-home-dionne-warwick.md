Whooa. whoooa. oh oh oh
A chair is still a chair
Even when there's no one sittin' there
Ohbut a chair is not a house
And a house is not a home
When there's no one there
To hold you tight
And no one there you can kiss goodnight
Whoa, yeah yeah
A room is a still a room
Even when there's nothin' there but gloom
But a room is not a house and a house is not a home
When the two of us are far apart
And one of us has a broken heart

Now and then
I call your name
And suddenly your face appears
Ooo... but it's just a crazy game

When it ends, it ends in tears

Darling, have a heart, don't let one mistake keep us apart
I'm not meant to live alone, turn this house into a home
When I climb the stairs, yeah yeah
And turn the key oh, please be there,
Sayin' that you're still in love with me, yeah
I'm not meant to live alone, turn this house into a home
When I climb the stairs and turn the key
Oh, please be there, still in love
Still in love with me
Still in love with me
