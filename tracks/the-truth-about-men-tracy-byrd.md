We don't like to go out shopping,
We don't care whats on sale,
We just wanna sit with a bag full of chips
Watchin the NFL

When you come over at half time
And say does this dress fit to tight
We just look you in the eye with a big fat lie
And say uh uh it looks just right

Well thats the truth about men
Thats the truth about us
We like to hunt, and golf on our days off
And scratch and spit and cuss
And no matter what line we hand you
When we come draggin in
We ain't wrong we ain't sorry and it's
Probably gonna happen again

We hate watchin steel magnolias
We like rambo and die hard 4
Jump up and down like fools
When we see the new tools
At the home depo store
We don't really wanna take you to dinner
At some fancy resturaunt
The only reason we do is cause
We know it leads too the one thing
That we all want

Well thats the truth about men
Thats the truth about guys
We'd rather pick guitars and work on cars
Then work on the problems in our lives
And tho we might say it to you every now and then
We ain't wrong we ain't sorry and it's
Probably gonna happen again

Well if you wanna know what we're all thinkin
It's nothing to complex
It's just some thing cold for drinkin
And a whole lot of S.E.X
Well thats the truth about men
Thats the truth about us
We like to hunt, and golf and drive around lost
And scratch and spit and a whole lot of other discusting stuff
And no matter what line we give you
When we come crawlin in
We ain't wrong we ain't sorry and it's
Probably gonna happen again
We ain't wrong we ain't sorry and it's
probably gonna happen sure it's gonna happen
You know it's gonna happen again

And thats the truth about men
