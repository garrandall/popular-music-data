Drivin around
I just can't hear a sound
'Cept my own wheels turnin
Wastin a day
I'm just runnin away
From a heart that's burnin
But I can't run forever

Yes
We're gonna fall in love
And it feels so right
Yes
We're gonna make love
It's gonna be tonight
I can just imagine
Huggin and teasin and
Lovin and squeezin all night

I've made up my mind
He's gonna be mine
I'm so glad I waited
Why did I try
To figure out why
Everything can't be anticipated
I can't wait to tell him

Yes
We're gonna fall in love
And it feels so right
Yes
We're gonna make love
It's gonna be tonight
I can just imagine
Huggin and teasin and
Lovin and squeezin all night
Yes

Yes
Heavin' and lovin' and squeezin' all night
Yes
I can just imagine
Huggin' and teasin' and
Lovin' and squeezin' all night

Yes
We're gonna fall in love
And it feels so right
Yes
We're gonna make love
It's gonna be tonight
Yes
We're gonna fall in love
And it feels so right
Yes
We're gonna make love
It's gonna be tonight
Yes
We're gonna fall in love
And it feels so right
Yes
We're gonna make love
It's gonna be tonight
Yes
We're gonna fall in love
And it feels so right
Yes
We're gonna make love
It's gonna be tonight
