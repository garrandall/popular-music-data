Bow bow whompa bow bow
Bow bow whompa bow bow
Bow bow whompa bow bow

Bow bow whompa bow bow

Looky over there, sunshine in her hair
That's my girl, her name is Skooby-Doo
Don'tcha like her smile?
Don'tcha like her style?
You know I'd walk a mile for Skooby-Doo

Oh my Skooby-Doo
I'll do ya what you want me to
Oh my Skooby-Doo
You got my lonely head a-reeling all the time
Feelin' so good
So good
Feelin' so good

Anytime at all I wanna have a ball
All I do is call my Skooby-Doo
She can make me laugh in a minute in a half
Yes, I'm going daff with Skooby-Doo

Oh my Skooby-Doo
I'll do ya what you want me to
Oh my Skooby-Doo
You got my only head a-reeling all the time
Feelin' so good
So good
Feelin' so good

Oh my I love you
Skooby-Doo, I love you
I said a "S"
"k"
"o-o"
"b"
"y"
"d-o-o"
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh
Oh
Oh oh oh oh

Diamonds and a ring, presents I could bring
Wouldn't mean a thing to Skooby-Doo
Sunday after mass picnic in the grass
Diggin' Mama Cass with Skooby-Doo

Oh my Skooby-Doo
I'll do ya what you want me to
Oh my Skooby-Doo
You got my only head a-reeling all the time
Feelin' so good
So good
Feelin' so good
So good

Feelin' so good

Whompa bow bow
Whompa bow bow
Whompa bow bow
My Skooby-Doo
Feelin' so good

Whompa bow bow
Whompa bow bow
Whompa bow bow
MY Skooby-Doo

Whompa bow bow
Whompa bow bow
Whompa bow bow
My Skooby-Doo
Feelin' so good
