She'd snuggle up and talk to me
Each night as I watched TV
I'd teasingly call her Chatterbox

Then one night
She said don't be scared
I see an angel on the stairs
Daddy, can you hear the angel talk

()
One more year of lollipops
Ice cream cones and soda pop
One more year of Daddy's little girl
One more year of Crackerjacks
Bubble gum and sugar smacks
One more year of Daddy's little girl

I took her in my arms upstairs
And as she said her nighttime prayers
I felt a fever burning in her head

She gave thanks for Mom and me
And said, I heard my angel speak
Daddy, this is what my angel said

()

Her faith grew strong, her body weak
And soon my frightened eyes could see
There was nothing on Earth that I could do

And one year later, to the day
In her sleep, she slipped away
And I knew what she'd said
And heard was true

()

One more year of Daddy's little girl
