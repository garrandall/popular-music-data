You left me here alone
I guess I'll never see the light
You turned another's thumb
And he makes your wrongs
seem right 
Out on some different wavelength
Somehow he brings you more 
But sweetheart tonight
I know for sure
I'll see those tears
The damage they do
You're breaking my heart with those tears
I'll cry over you
Can we make a new start
Of all the girls I've had at my knees
You're the only one
That could bring me to these tears 
A master of the beat
You've got my number in your hands
A killer on the streets
You've got your actions planned 
But somewhere in your heart
There must be a place for me 
Cause sweetheart tonight
I know for sure
I'll see those tears
The damage they do
You're breaking my heart with those tears
I'll cry over you
Can we make a new start
Of all the girls I've had at my knees
You're the only one
That could bring me to these tears 
Oh yeah
Oh yeah 
I'm looking at you
You're looking at me
You won't let me go
But you won't set me free
Of those tears
The damage they do
You're breaking my heart with those tears
Cry over you
Cry for you tonight 
Cry you a river
I'm gonna cry for you tonight
I'm gonna cry you a river
Cry you a river tonight
(Cry for you)
I'm gonna cry for you tonight
(Cry for you)
I'm gonna cry you a river 
(Cry for you)
I'll cry for you tonight
