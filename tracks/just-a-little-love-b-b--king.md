Some people die for hate
Some die for love
Some die because
They don't have mate
But all I want
All I want is a little love
All I've ever wanted, people
All I want is just a little love

All I want (All I want)
A little bit of love (A little bit of love)
All I want (All I want)
Is a little bit of love (Is a little bit of love)
All I want (All I want)
Is just a little bit of love (Is just a little bit of love)

Everybody say the world is large
But to me it's very small
Out of all of these women
I can't find no true love at all
All I want
Is just a little love
All I've ever wanted, mm
Is just a little love

All I want (All I want)
Is a little bit of love (Is a little bit of love)
All I want (All I want)
Is a little bit of love (Is a little bit of love)
I say all I want (All I want)
Is just a little bit of love (Is just a little bit of love)

All I want (All I want)
Is a little bit of love (Is a little bit of love)
All I need (All I need)
Is a little bit of love (Is a little bit of love)
All I want (All I want)
Is just a little bit of love (Is just a little bit of love)

All I want
Is a little bit of love
All I want
Is a little bit of love
All I want
Is just a little bit of love
