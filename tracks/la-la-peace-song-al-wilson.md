Mmm hmm, la la, oh, yeah

What's that sound, so profound
Over heads of children, Lord
As they pass

Sounds like thunder
But thereâs no rain
This kind of thunder blows down
Doors and walls and things

Ah, somebody's crying
For those dying
But no one knows
How long it's gonna last

Steel birds falling to the ground
Not knowing whatâs below
When the end comes, tell me now
Where we gonna go

Oh, people, that's my
La la la la peace song
La la la la, tell me
Why can't we get along

Oh, people, that's my
La la la la peace song
La la la la, tell me
Why can't we get along

Oh, I'll tell you why
It's not safe to fly
You might get hijacked
To an unknown land

Desperate people seeking refuge
From corruption, oh
By means of subterfuge

Oh, sabotage, men at large
Innocent people suffering
By another's hand

Racial injustice dividing men
Allowing their hate to grow
Tell me, whenâs it gonna end

Whoa, oh, people, thatâs my
La la la la la la la peace song
La la la la, tell me
Why can't we get along

Oh, people, thatâs my
La la la la la la la peace song
La la la la, tell me
Why can't we get along
Oh, sing it with me now

Oh, hear me, that's my
La la la la la peace song
La la la la, tell me
Why can't we get along

Oh, hear that sound, so profound
Itâs the voice of people
Lord, hear them pray

Feel the strength of their words
Lead us not to temptation
Lest we go astray

Oh, people, that's my
La la la la peace song
La la la la, tell me
Why can't we get along

Oh, that's my
La la la la la peace song
La la la la, tell me
Why can't we get along
