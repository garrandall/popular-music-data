Grab your board and go sidewalk surfin' with me
Don't be afraid to try the newest sport around
Bust your buns, bust your buns now
It's catchin' on in every city and town

You can do the tricks the surfers do, just try a
"Quasimodo" or "The Coffin" too, why don't you?
Grab your board and go sidewalk surfin' with me

You'll probably wipeout when you first try to shoot the curve
Bust your buns, bust your buns now
Takin' gas in a bush takes a lotta nerve

Those hopscotch poledads and pedestrians, too, will bug ya
Shout "Cowabunga!" now and skate right on through, why don't you?
Grab your board and go sidewalk surfin' with me

You can do the tricks the surfers do, just try a
"Quasimodo" or "The Coffin" too, why don't you?
Grab your board and go sidewalk surfin' with me

So get your girl and take her tandem down the street
Bust your buns, bust your buns now
Then she'll know you're an asphalt athlete

A downhill grade, man, will give you a kick
But if the sidewalk's cracked, ya better pull out quick, why don't you?
Grab your board and go sidewalk surfin' with me
Skateboard with me, why don't you skateboard me?
Grab your board and go sidewalk surfin' with me
Skateboard with me, why don't you skateboard me?

Grab your board and go sidewalk surfin' with me
Skateboard with me, why don't you skateboard me?
Grab your board and go sidewalk surfin' with me
Skateboard with me, why don't you skateboard me?
Grab your board and go sidewalk surfin' with me
