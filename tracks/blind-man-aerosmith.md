I took a course in Hallelujah 
I went to night school for de blues 
I took some stuff they said would cool ya...hea ha 
But nothing seemed to light my fuse 

But that's all in the past 
Like a check that's in the mail 
She was a tall whiskey glass 
I was an old hound dog 
That just loved to chase his tail 

Until I met a Blind Man 
Who taught me how to see...yeah 
A Blind Man 
Who could change night into day 
And if a I can 
I'm gonna make you come with me...yeah 
Because a here come the sun 
And we'll be chasing all the clouds away...yeah yeah... 

I've had some lovers like a joyride 
Some things are never what they seem 
My heaven's turned into a landslide 
Thank God I woke up from that dream 

I met a Blind Man 
Who taught me how to see...yeah 
Blind Man 
Who could change night into day 
And if a I can 
I'm gonna make you come with me...yeah 
Beacuse a here comes the sun 
And we'll be chasing all the clouds the way 
The bee's chase honey 
And drink all the flowers dry 
We'll be saving us a little money 
And if that doesn't do it, yeah 
I know the reason why 

Don't make no sense lightin' candles 
There's too much moonlight in my eyes 

I met a Blind Man 
Who taught me how to see...yeah 
Blind Man 
Who could change night into day 
And if a I can 
I'm gonna make you come with me...ah ah ah ah yeah 
Because a here come the sun 
Ain't no surprise 
Ain't no doubt about it 
Gonna open up my eyes
