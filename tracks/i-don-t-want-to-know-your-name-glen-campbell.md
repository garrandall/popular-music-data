I see you just like the movies
I see your face
Across a crowded room
And I have learned through
Simple trial and error
Not to speak too soon

Your eyes just like a magnet
They're drawing my eyes around
And I can't hear one
Word of conversation
I can't hear a sound

I see you looking at me
You see me looking at you


I don't wanna know your name
And I don't wanna play this game
Where two lovers meet
And one lover parts in pain

I feel this urge to meet you
I feel this urge to run
Repairing hearts so easily shattered
Is never any fun

I see you looking at me
You see me looking at you


I don't wanna know your name
I don't wanna play this game
I don't wanna know your name
I don't wanna play this game
