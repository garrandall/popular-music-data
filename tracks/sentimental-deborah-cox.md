I used to mess around
But I never let it get into me
'Cause I didn't take you serious baby
Now to be without your love
Only makes me realize
What I could've had in you honey

Now that you're gone (oh oh oh)
I want you more
I said it slapped me in my face
And then my friends don't understand
Because I had the chance
I don't know why


I'm going crazy alone in a daze
And my heart ain't the same
And I don't even think unless I think about you
That's the only time I get sentimental
That's the reason why baby
I can't let go of you
Yeah, that's the only time I get sentimental

I miss you day and night, seems like you're still here
I'd rather be together honey
Now that I'm lost for words
I can't believe I'm on my own
I should've been looking at love

Now that you're gone
I want you (oh oh oh)
I said it slapped me on my face
And now my friends don't understand
Because I had the chance
I don't know why



Now that you're gone I want you more
I said it slapped me on my face
And then my friends don't understand
Because I had the chance
I don't know why
