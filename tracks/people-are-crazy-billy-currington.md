This old man and me
Were at the bar and we
Were having us some beers
And swapping I-dont-cares
Talking politics
Blonde and red-haired chicks
Old dogs and new tricks
And habits we ain't kicked

We talked about God's grace
And all the hell we raised
Then I heard the ol' man say
"God is great, beer is good
And people are crazy"

He said, "I fought two wars
Been married and divorced"
What brings you to Ohio?
He said, "Damned if I know"
We talked an hour or two
About every girl we knew
What all we put 'em through
Like two old boys'll do

We pondered life and death
He lit a cigarette
He said, "These damn things'll kill me yet"

"But God is great, beer is good
And people are crazy"

Last call is 2 AM
I said goodbye to him
I never talk to him again

Then one sunny day
I saw the old man's face
Front page obituary
He was a millionaire
He left his fortune to
Some guy he barely knew
His kids were mad as hell
But me, I'm doing well

And I dropped by today
To just say thanks and pray
And I left a six-pack right there on his grave
And I said
"God is great, beer is good
And people are crazy"

God is great, beer is good
And people are crazy
God is great, beer is good
And people are crazy
