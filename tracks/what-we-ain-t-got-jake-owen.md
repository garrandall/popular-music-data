I saw your number on my phone,
I said yeah I'm here alone.
I saw the lights, opened the door before you rang my bell
Hey how ya been? And you leaned in and I just told myself

One little kiss never killed nobody,
One little drink never wrecked no party.
Thought we were over baby, but you kept getting closer baby.
One little touch never broke no heart girl,
But I always wanna finish what you start girl.
Now your gone and it's hitting me,
Like a bullet and it's hard to breath,
One little kiss never killed nobody, but me.

Aint goin out, aint getting drunk
Don't need a shot to get messed up
I'm thumbing through pictures of you from last night
Thought I'd be fine to see you one last time, yea right

One little kiss never killed nobody,
One little drink never wrecked no party.
Thought we were over baby, but you kept getting closer baby.
One little touch never broke no heart girl,
But I always wanna finish what you start girl.
Now your gone and it's hitting me,
Like a bullet and it's hard to breath,
One little kiss never killed nobody, but me.

Right here, they said I never would have listened when you whispered in my
Ear, last night when you said "Baby it's alright"

One little kiss never killed nobody, 
One little kiss never killed nobody,
One little drink never wrecked no party.
Thought we were over baby, but you kept getting closer baby.
One little touch never broke no heart girl,
But I always wanna finish what you start girl.
Now your gone and it's hitting me,
Like a bullet and it's hard to breath,
One little kiss never killed nobody, but me.
Nobody but me
