We all want what we ain't got
Our favorite doors are always locked
On a higher hill with a taller top
We all want what we ain't got
We ain't happy where we are
There's greener grass in the neighbors yard
A bigger house and a faster car
We ain't happy where we are


All I want is what I had
I'll trade it all just to get her back
She's moving on, but I guess I'm not
We all want what we ain't got


We all wish it didn't hurt
When you try your best and it doesn't work
And goodbye's such a painful word
We all wish it didn't hurt


All I want is what I had
I'll trade it all just to get her back
She's moving on, but I guess I'm not
We all want what we ain't got


All I want is what I had
I'll trade it all just to get her back
She's moving on, but I guess I'm not
We all want what we ain't got


I wanted the world until my whole world stopped
You know a love like that ain't easily forgot
I guess we all want what we ain't got
Yeah, we all want what we ain't got
