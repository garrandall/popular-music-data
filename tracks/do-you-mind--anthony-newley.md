If I say I love you do you mind
Make an idol of you do you mind
If I shower you with kisses
If I tell you honey this is
How I think of heaven do you mind

I want to whisper, whisper sweet nothings in your ear
Nothings that are meant for my love alone to hear

So then
If I say I love you do you mind
Make an idol of you do you mind
If I shower you with kisses
If I tell you honey this is
How I think of heaven do you mind

I want to whisper, whisper sweet nothings in your ear
Nothings that are meant for my love alone to hear

So then
If I say I love you do ya mind baby
Make an idol of you do you mind
If I shower you with kisses
If I tell you honey this is
How I think of heaven do you mind

Do you mind
Do you mind
Honey do you mind
