You don't know what you do to me
Sometimes I find
You knock me off my feet
Oh how I wish
That we could be alone
Oh how I wish to me
That you belonged

I often watch you
When you're least aware
Even though I know
It's really rude to stare
Sometimes I find
I just can't help myself
'Cos I want you
want nobody else

My heart skips a beat
Whenever you are near
And I just don't know
What I'm gonna do

Oh how I wish
That you were here
Oh how I wish
That you were near
Holding me tight
Spending some time
Wish you were mine

My thoughts revealed
I'm showing all the signs
When we're face to face
I can't look in your eyes
Sometimes I find
I just can't help myself
'Cos I want you
Want nobody else

My heart skips a beat
Whenever you are near
And I just don't know
What I'm gonna do

Oh how I wish
That you were here
Oh how I wish
That you were near
Holding me tight
Spending some time
Wish you were mine

My heart skips a beat
Whenever you are near
And I just don't know
What I'm gonna do
