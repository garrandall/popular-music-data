Wind me up, put me down, start me off and watch me go
I'll be running circles around you sooner than you know
A little off center and I'm out of tune
Just kicking this can along the avenue
But I'm alright

Because it's easy once you know how it's done
You can't stop now, it's already begun
You feel it running through your bones

And you jerk it out
And you jerk it out

Shut up, hush your mouth, can't you hear you talk too loud
No I can't hear nothing cause I got my head up in the clouds
I bite off anything that I can chew
I'm chasing cars up and down the avenue
But that's okay

Because it's easy once you know how it's done
You can't stop now, it's already begun
You feel it running through your bones

And you jerk it out

'Cause it's easy once you know how it's done
You can't stop now, it's already begun
You feel it running through your bones

And you jerk it out

And you jerk it out
And you jerk it out
And you jerk it out
Oh baby don't you know you really gotta jerk it out
When you jerk it out
Oh baby don't you know you really gotta jerk it out
When you jerk it out
Oh baby don't you know you really gotta jerk it out
