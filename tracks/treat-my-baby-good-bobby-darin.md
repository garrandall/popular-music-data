You better treat my baby good
If you know what's good for you
You'd better never make her cry

Go on make one mistake
And I'll step in and take
Away the ache in her heart
So... play it smart

You better treat my baby good
If you know what's good for you
Don't ever let me see her blue

Go ahead and put her down
Once too often around a friend in town
And you'll see
She's back with me

Who am I kiddin'?

She's better off without me now
And I know that's good for you
But, all the same keep this in mind

Just make sure everyday
That you treat her the way
She'd like to say that you should
Treat my baby good

Just make sure everyday
That you treat her the way
She'd like to say that you should
Treat my baby good

Just make sure everyday
That you treat her the way
She'd like to say that you should
