Ah, oo
In my own way I say too much
Love has a lonely way of leaving us
Outside a storm is brewing
I can hear the sound
And inside my heart is beating out loud
I can't live on without her
I don't wanna go on
Cause life has no meaning without her
I can't wait that long

And tell me where can a man find such a woman
To give him all the love he needs in his heart
She's there for his lovin
God knows he needs her so bad

And in my own time I've heard the call
I've seen so many roses bloom
And I've seen them fall
I know the things a man Must do to make him strong
I know the kind of love I've needed for so long

And tell me where can a man find such a woman
To give him all the love he needs in his heart
She's there for his lovin
God knows he needs her so bad

All through the night she's there
Just to treasure his love
That's the life, high on the pleasure of love
That's all right
God knows he needs her so bad
And maybe I am lost and I just can't be found
Maybe it'll be true love next time around
Maybe next time
Somebody tell me where can a man
Find such a woman
To give him all the love he needs in his heart
She's there for his lovin
God knows he needs her so bad
