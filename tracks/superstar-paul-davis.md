Bernie writes the words 
While Elton makes the music and the melody
Philadelphia Freedom 
Always sounds so good to me
Stevie, you're a wonder 
When you're singin' that perfect harmony (yeah, sweet harmony)
It's hard to believe 
All the love that blind man made me see, whoa...

Superstar
I want to thank you for what you are, oh whoa
Only six ninety-eight
Lord, you sound so great
And I just can't wait
To hear you singin' (come on, come on)
Come on and sing it, woah...

Heart like a wheel 
Always made me feel any way I want to be
Linda, you're a winner
Oh, girl, you're lookin' thinner than you used to be
Joni Mitchell, you 
Always pull me through when I get down and blue
Music is your callin'
Help, I think I'm fallin' in love with you, whoa...

Superstar
I want to thank you for what you are, whoa...
Only six ninety-eight
Lord, you sound so great
And I just can't wait
To hear you singin' (come on, come on)
Come on and sing it, whoa...
Sing it (come on, come on)
Come on and sing it, whoa...
Sing it (come on, come on)
Come on and sing it, whoa...

Sing another song and make me happy
Come on and sing it (happy)
Whoa...

Sing another song and make me happy
Come on and sing it (happy)
Whoa...

Sing another song and make me happy
Come on and sing it (happy)
Whoa...

Sing another song and make me happy
Come on and sing it (happy)
Whoa...
