Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind, hey Mickey, hey Mickey
Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind, hey Mickey, hey Mickey

Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind, hey Mickey, hey Mickey
Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind, hey Mickey

Hey Mickey
You've been around all night and that's a little long
You think you've got the right, but I think you've got it wrong
Why can't you say goodnight? So you can take me home Mickey?

'Cause when you say you will, it always means you won't
You're givin' me the chills, baby, please, baby don't
Every night you still leave me alone Mickey

Oh Mickey, what a pity, you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand
Oh Mickey, you're so pretty, can't you understand
It's guys like you, Mickey
Oh what you do Mickey, do Mickey
Don't break my heart, Mickey

Hey Mickey
Now when you take me by the hooves, who's ever gonna know
And every time you move I let a little more show
There's something you can use, so don't say no Mickey

So come on and give it to me anyway you can
Anyway you want to do it, I'll take it like a man
But please baby, please don't leave me in the damp Mickey

Oh Mickey, what a pity, you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand
Oh Mickey, you're so pretty, can't you understand?
It's guys like you, Mickey
Oh what you do Mickey, do Mickey
Don't break my heart, Mickey

Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind, hey Mickey, hey Mickey
Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind, hey Mickey, hey Mickey

Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind, hey Mickey, hey Mickey
Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind, hey Mickey

Oh Mickey, what a pity, you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand
Oh Mickey, you're so pretty, can't you understand?
It's guys like you, Mickey
Oh what you do Mickey, do Mickey
Don't break my heart, Mickey

Oh Mickey, what a pity, you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand
Oh Mickey, you're so pretty, can't you understand?
It's guys like you, Mickey
Oh what you do Mickey, do Mickey
Don't break my heart, Mickey

Oh Mickey, what a pity, you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand
Oh Mickey, you're so pretty, can't you understand?
It's guys like you, Mickey
Oh what you do Mickey, do Mickey
Don't break my heart, Mickey

Oh Mickey, what a pity, you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand
