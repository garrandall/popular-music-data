There must be something
That I'm missing
Or is it something
That she's got, oh, baby

Ladies and gentlemen
While landing at Chicago's O'Hare airport
Please fasten your seatbelts
And observe the no smoking signal
Until you're well inside the terminal
Thank you

Hello, hon, yes, this is Tyrone
Now please, don't hang up the phone

You see, I came all the way up here
Just to say to you, baby
I'm so sorry

And if my loving
Mean anything at all to you
I just wanna tell you, I've changed
I mean, I'm a brand new me
Oh, baby, yeah, I'm ready to crawl

You see
I don't know what it is you got
But whatever it is, without it
I'm a lonely man

You see, baby
Ever since I've been away
I've had a lot of time to think
A lot of time to reminisce
About all the good things about you

Oh, yeah, I had a date or two
But what do that mean, you know
They could never take the place of you

And you see, baby
What I was trying to find
I had it in you all the time

Well, baby, I'm gonna say goodbye
But not for long
Just for the time it will take a cab
To get me home

Here they go, the same two feet
Walking back down that one-way street
Here goes this heart of mine
It say, you'll let me
Get her back one more time

I keep telling myself
That I don't want you no more
But every day of my life
I have to knock up on your door

And that lets me know
What I've been trying to find
I had it all the time

You see, I can't stop
Feeling this way about you, babe
I can't stop feeling
This way about you, babe

Oh, here go these two eyes of mine
They long to see you one more time
My lips wants to kiss you
My arms can't resist you
I'd swallow my pride
To tell you how much I miss you

You see, I can't stop
Feeling this way about you, babe
I can't stop feeling
This way about you, babe

And what I was out there
Trying to find
I had it all the time

I said, what I was
Out there trying to find
Oh, baby, I had it all the time

I can't stop feeling this way about you
I can't stop feeling this way about you

Oh, I went out on other dates
And I found that I made a mistake
You see, something was missing
It wasn't you I was kissing
While in anothers arms
I found myself reminiscing

And that let me know
What I was trying to find
I had it all the time

I said, that let me know
What I was trying to find
I had it all the time

You see, I can't stop
Feeling this way about you, baby
I can't stop feeling
This way about you, babe

I'm coming on home
I got to see you
One more time, baby
I'm coming, I'm coming
Oh, baby, I got to have you

Mama, mama, mama, mama
Look out, I'm coming home
