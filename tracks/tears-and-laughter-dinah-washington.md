No one's gonna come alone
And line your palms with gold
And if he did, you would unfold
And if you did, you'd be wrong to take it
After all the tears and all the laughter
Your happiness is a string of disasters
Oh, what more could someone ask for

No one's gonna say it's fault
To set alight your soul
But if you did
Where would it go
With all your home in ashes

After all the fear of showing ages
On your face like a heavy scepter time
When time is all we're after

Step wasters in the line
There we'll watch them all walk by
To the waterside

After all the fear of showing ages
On your face like a heavy scepter time
When time is all we're after

Still on all the walls
We have reminders
Of the time we left behind us
Now all your words are silence

Step wasters in the line
There we'll watch them all walk by
To the waterside
