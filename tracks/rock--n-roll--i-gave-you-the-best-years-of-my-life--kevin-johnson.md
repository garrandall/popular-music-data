I can still remember when I bought my first Guitar
Remember just how good the feeling was put it proudly in my car
And my family listened fifty times to my two-song-repertoire
And I told my mam her only son was gonna be a star.
I bought all the Beatle-records sounded just like Paul
I bought all the old Chuck Berries 78's and all.
I sat by my record-player playing every note they played
Now watched them all on TV copied every move they made.

Oh, Rockn' roll I gave you all the best years of my life
All the dreamy sunny sundays all the moonlit summer nights
I was so busy in the back-room writing love-songs to you
And you were changing your direction and you never even knew.
That I was always just one step behind you.

66 seemed like the year I was really goin' somewhere
We were living in San Francisco weard flowers in my hair.
Singing songs of kindness so the world would understand
That the Guys and me thought we were more than just another band!
And then 69 in L.A.? came around so soon we were really making hippie
Writing love-song tunes.
There we must have played the wildest thing we had ever played.
The way the crowds cried out for us we thouth we had it made.

Oh, Rockn' roll I gave you all the best years of my life
All the crazy lazy young days all the magic moony nights
I was so busy on the road singing love-songs to you
And you were changing your direction and you never even knew.
That I was always just one step behind you.

71 in Soho when I saw Susan
I was trying to go it solo with someone else's band
And she came up to me ladylike took me by the hand
And I told her all my troubles and she seemed to understand
And she followed me through London to a hundred hotel rooms
To a hundred record companies who didn't like my tunes.
And she followed me when finally I sold my old guitar
And she tried to help me understand
That I'll never be a star.

Oh, Rock? n roll I gave you all the best years of my llfe
All the dreamy sunny sundays all the moonlit summer nights
Oh I never knew the magic of making it with you
L'm getting along with my country-songs
Doin' what I wanna do
And I was always just one step behind you.
Oh, Rock'n roll I gave you all the best years of my llfe
