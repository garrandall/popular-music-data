What's so good about goodbye?
All it does is make-a you cry
Well, if leaving causes grieving
And depart can break you heart
Tell me what's so good about it
I could have done without it
What's so good about goodbye?


Since you said goodbye to me
All I've known is misery
Well, if everything goes wrong
And lovers say so long
Tell me what's so good about it
I could have done without it
What's so good about goodbye?


How can goodbye be good to a lover who really cares?
And another thing I would like to clarify
Is how can farewell be fair?
Won't you please tell me why
You could say this is goodbye
Girl, when it makes me so sad then it's got to be bad
Tell me what's so good about it
I could have done without it
What's so good about goodbye?

Won't somebody tell me, now
How can goodbye be good to a lover who really cares?
And another thing I would like to clarify
Is how can farewell be fair?
Won't you please tell me why
You would have the nerve to say this is goodbye
Girl, when it makes me so sad then it's got to be bad
Tell me what's so good about it
I could have done without it
What's so good about goodbye?
Baby
What's so good about goodbye?
