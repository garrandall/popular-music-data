For you, there'll be no more cryin'
For you, the sun will be shinin'
And I feel that when I'm with you
It's alright, I know it's right

To you, I'll give the world
To you, I'll never be cold
'Cause I feel that when I'm with you
It's alright, I know it's right

And the songbirds are singing
Like they know the score
And I love you, I love you, I love you
Like never before

Oooohhh
Oooohhh

And I wish you all the love in the world
But most of all, I wish it from myself

And the songbirds keep singing
Like they know the score

And I love you, I love you, I love you
Like never before, like never before
Like never before
