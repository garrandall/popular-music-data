For you, thereâll be no more crying,
For you, the sun will be shining,
And I feel that when Iâm with you,
Itâs alright, I know itâs right

To you, Iâll give the world
To you, Iâll never be cold
âCause I feel that when Iâm with you,
Itâs alright, I know itâs right.

And the songbirds are singing,
Like they know the score,
And I love you, I love you, I love you,
Like never before.

And I wish you all the love in the world,
But most of all, I wish it from myself.

And the songbirds keep singing,
Like they know the score,
And I love you, I love you, I love you,
Like never before, like never before.
