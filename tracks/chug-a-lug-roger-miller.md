Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug
Make you want to holler hi-de-ho
Burns your tummy, don'tcha know?
Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug

Grape wine in a Mason jar
Homemade and brought to school
By a friend of mine 'n' after class
Me and him and this other fool decide

That we'll drink up what's left
Chug-a-lug, so we helped ourself
First time for everything
Hmm, my ears still ring

Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug
Make you want to holler hi-de-ho
Burns your tummy, don'tcha know?
Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug

4-H and FFA
On a field trip to the farm
Me 'n' a friend sneak off behind
This big old barn where we uncovered

A covered-up moonshine still
And we thought we'd drink our fill
And I swallered it with a smile
Bll-bbb, I run ten mile

Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug
Make you want to holler hi-de-ho
Burns your tummy, don'tcha know?
Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug

Jukebox 'n' sawdust floor
Sumpin' like I ain't never seen
And I'm just goin' on fifteen
But with the help of my finaglin'

Uncle I get snuck in
For my first taste of sin
I said, "Lemme have a big old sip"
Bll-bbb, I done a double back flip

Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug
Make you want to holler hi-de-ho
Burns your tummy, don'tcha know?
Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug
Chug, Chug, chug-a-lug
