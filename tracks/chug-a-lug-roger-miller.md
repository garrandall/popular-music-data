Chug-a-lug chug a lug
Make ya wanna holla hidy hoe,
Burns your tummy don't you know
Chug-a-lug chug-a-lug

Grape wine in a mason jar
Homemade and brought to school
By a friend of mine after class
Me and him and this other fool
Decided that we'll drink up whats left
Chug-a-lug so I helped myself
First time for everything
Umm my ears still ring

Chug-a-lug Chug-a-lug
Make you wanna holla hidy hoe,
Burns your tummy don't you know
Chug-a-lug chug-a-lug

4 H and an FFA
On a field trip to the farm
Me and friend sneak off behind
This big old barn
Where we uncovered a covered up
Moonshine still
And we thought we'd drink our fill
And I swallowed it with a smile
Ohh I run ten mile

Chug-a-lug chug a lug
Make u wanna holla hidy hoe,
Burns your tummy don't you know
Chug-a-lug chug-a-lug

Jukebox and sawdust floor
Somthin' like I've never seen
Heck I'm just going on 15,
But with the help of my finaglin' uncle
I get snuck in for my first taste of sin
I said let me have a big old sip
Bbbbb I done a double back flip

Chug-a-lug chug a lug
Make u wanna holla hidy hoe,
Burns your tummy don't you know
Chug-a-lug chug-a-lug chig a chagle uh
