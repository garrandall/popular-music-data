Ooh, I can see that you've got fire in your eyes
And pain inside your heart
So many things have come and torn your world apart

Oh baby, baby, baby
Don't give up
Don't give up
Don't give up

(If you want love) 
If you want love, you've got to give a little 
(If you want love)
If you want faith, you just believe a little 
(If you want love)
If you want peace, turn your cheek a little

Oh, you've got to give
You've got to give
You've got to give to live

An empty hand reaching out for someone
An empty heart takes so little to fill
It's so much easier to push instead of pull

Oh baby, baby, baby
Don't give up
Don't give up
Don't give up

(If you want love) 
If you want love, you've got to give a little
(If you want love)
If you want faith, you just believe a little
(If you want love)
If you want peace, turn your cheek a little

Oh, you've got to give 
You've got to give 
You've got to give to live

Each man's a country in his own right
Oh, everybody needs a friend
One friend, one God, one country
No man need defend, yeah

I believe in fate and destination 
But so much of that lies in our own hands
If you know what you want, just go on out and get it

Oh baby, baby
Just don't give up, no, no
Don't give up, yeah, yeah

(If you want love)
If you want love, you've got to give a little 
(If you want love)
If you want faith, you just believe a little 
(If you want love) 
If you want peace, turn your cheek a little

Oh, if you want love, you've got to give 
(If you want love) oh, give to live 
(If you want love) you've got to give
You've got to give, you've got to give to live
(If you want love)

(If you want love) oh, oh
(If you want love) oh, oh
(If you want love) oh, oh
(If you want love) oh, oh
