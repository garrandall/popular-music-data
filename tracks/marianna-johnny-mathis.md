Hello, hello Marianna
I took a trip on you, do you remember me?
Hello, hello Marianna
I see you sleeping right here next to me

Hello, hello Marianna
In your constellations I'm your valentine
Hello, hello Marianna
Pack up your suitcase, let's go on holiday

I grew you flowers
Dreamt in bad taste
Swam across oceans
Float into space

I'm just a crazy fool
I'll re-write the alphabet
I'm open to love you forever
But you haven't tried it yet

Hello, hello Marianna
Send me a postcard, bring back a memory
Hello, hello Marianna
I see you sleeping right here next to me

Hello, hello Marianna
In your constellations I'm your valentine
Hello, hello Marianna
Pack up your suitcase, let's go on holiday

I've got your picture on my wall
Shaking your legs, ready and waiting
For what happens next
Yes, I'm a crazy fool
I'll re-write the alphabet

I'm open to love you forever
But you haven't tried it yet
It hasn't happened yet
But it will, I promise it will
I will live on your window sill until you see me

Hello, hello Marianna
I took a trip on you, do you remember me?
Hello, hello Marianna
I see you sleeping right here next to me

Hello, hello Marianna
In your constellations I'm your valentine
Hello, hello Marianna
Pack up your suitcase, let's go on holiday
