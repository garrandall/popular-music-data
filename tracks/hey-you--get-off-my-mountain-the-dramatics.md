Hey you, get off my mountain
Hey you, get off my cloud
Hey you, get off my mountain
You're just trying to
Bring me down

And you laugh in my face
Make me feel like a clown
Baby, I think I better put you in your place

That kind of action I don't need
(I don't need that kind of action)
That kind of heartache I can't use
(I can't use that kind of heartache)
That kind of loving I can do without
So go and play your games with someone new

Hey you (hey you), get off my mountain
Hey you (you), get off my cloud
Hey you (hey you), get off my mountain
You're just trying to (you're just trying to)
You're just trying to
Bring me down

That kind of action I don't need
(I don't need that kind of action)
And that kind of heartache I can't use
(I can't use that kind of heartache)
That kind of loving I can do without
So go and play your games with someone new

Hey you (hey you), get off my mountain
Hey you (hey you), get off my cloud (stay off of my cloud)
Hey you, get off my mountain
You're just trying to (you're just trying to)
I said you're just trying to
Bring me down

You're trying, you're trying
You're trying, you're trying
