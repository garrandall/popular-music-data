Ow, mmm, mmm, mmm
Click-click-click-click

Make your body stop
Strike a love that's so deep
Make your body stop

Turn your head this way, baby, I'm focused in on you
And your sexy smile
Turn a little, babe, left, blend into the light
I'd like to do you perfectly right

And I want to snap, out, you, strike a love that's so deep
And I want to snap, out, you, 'Cause I like to move thee

Click on over here, baby, the color of your face
Expose your beauty and grace

Ow, out, you, strike a love that's so deep
Said I want to snap, out, you, yeah, hey, 'cause I like to move thee

Come a little closer, got the total view
Like to get and show to you
Your jeans they fit so tight, the camera takes all of you
In my darkroom turn out the light

Said I want to snap, out, you, 'cause I like to move thee
And I want to snap, out, you, strike a love that's so deep

Mmm, the upper persuasion from the lower invasion

Ow, out
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
Said I want to snap out, out, you, strike a love that's so deep

Gonna use my telephoto, zoom it in on you
I look so serious too, uh-huh
I gotta have your picture 'cause I'm stuck on you
A shot of you, you sexy thing

And I want to snap, out, you, baby, strike a love that's so deep
And I want to snap, out, you, I do, oh, oh, oh, yi-yi, 'cause I like to move thee

I'm focused, baby, out, I'm so high thinking about having
That shot of you, strike a love that's so deep, out, mmm, huh
Upper persuasion from the lower invasion, out

Ow, mmm, mmm, mmm

Make your body stop
Hey, babe, right there
Okay, turn a little to the right
Right there, strike a love that's so deep
That's it, that's it, snap you
Okay, now grab your hair and look real sexy now
And give me a big one, give me a big pretty smile now
'Cause I like to move thee
That's close, a little more
That's it, snap you
Alright now, here's
I want you to really get into this one
I mean show that real beautiful emotional smile, out
And get that body all the way like entwined with that good
Thing, alright, strike a love that's so deep
Come on, out, oh, snap you
Clap your hands, huh. 'cause I like to move thee
Alright
This one is for the cover of Life magazine
So we gonna get all the way tough on this one, right, out
Snap you again, strike a love that's so deep
That was a good stop, that stop was the bomb
In the pocket, in the pocket, out, you, strike a love that's
So deep
Mmm, the upper persuasion from the lower invasion
