My hands are clean, my heart is so pure
The world is sick, I am the cure
I don't want no money, or golden gifts
Give me your mind and souls to lift

Put your faith and trust in me
I'll move your mountains, part your seas.

All you poor, all you needy
All you're doing, is giving to the greedy
All you poor, all you needy
All you're doing, is giving to the greedy

Get off your knees, belive in me, I'll set you free
All I need is a little
Power
Power
Power
Power

I have for you, a master plan, (tell it)
I'll lead you to the promised land
I'll give you peace (peace)
I'll give you pride (pride)
I'll save you from the suicide

I'm your hope
One salvation
One man united nation

All you poor, all you needy
All you're doing, is giving to the greedy
All you poor, all you needy
All you're doing, is giving to the greedy

Tell me your fears, I'll be your friend, I won't don't you in
All I need is a little
Power
Power
Power
Power

I'll make you all, the master race
Just put me in my guarded place
We must work down on our feet
In the lands fields of oil and in the lands of wheat

Power

Power
I want it
Power
More
Power

One thing I must make, perfectly clear
Power
Nuclear weapons, all men fear
Power
Their hands sweat, their fingers itch
Power
I'm the only one you can trust with the switch
Power

Give it to me
Power
Power
Power
Power
Power
Give it to me

I need It
Power
Got to have it
Power
I must have it

Give it to me
