Things haven't been the same
Since you came into my life
You found a way to touch my soul
And I'm never, ever, ever gonna let it go


Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand
How it could be
Until you shared your
Secret with me


Something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret


You gave me back the paradise
That I thought I lost for good
You helped me find the reason why
It took me by surprise that you understood
You knew all along
What I never wanted to say
Until I learned to love myself
I was never ever loving anybody else


Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand
How it could be
Until you shared your
Secret with me


Something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret


Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand
How it could be
Until you shared your
Secret with me


Something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret


Mmm-mmm, my baby's got a secret
Mmm-mmm, my baby's got a secret
Mmm-mmm, my baby's got a secret for me
Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm
