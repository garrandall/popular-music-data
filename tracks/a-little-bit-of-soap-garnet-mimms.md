A little bit of soap will wash
Away the lipstick from my face
A little bit of soap will never
Never, never, ever erase
The pain in my heart and my eyes
As I go through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will never
Wash away my tears
Mmm, a little bit of soap will wash
Away your powder from my chin
A little bit of soap will never
Never, never, ever begin
To take away the hurt that I feel
As I go through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will never
Wash away my tears
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Have you heard
When love begins to die
It leaves someone to cry
Night and day
Like a bird, you left your
Robin's nest and just like
All the rest, you flew away
Mmm, a little bit of soap will
Take away your perfume eventually
A little bit of soap will never
Wash away the memory
Of your name in the night
That I call through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will never
Wash away my tears
I'll never lose the memory
Of your name in the night
That I call through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will
Never wash away my tears
I'll never lose the memory
Of your name in the night
That I call through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will
Never wash away my tears
