You make this so hard for me

Ooh, ooh, ooh, oooooh



Today I'm forever your lady
Tomorrow I cant take it
We've been through stormy weather
Get back together
And do it over again
Instead of me being your woman
I feel like I'm your opponent
I want this battle to end
Here I surrender
You can have it this aint what I need

But I'm so weak for you
I can only be without you for a day or two
Maybe I been fooling myself
Boy this relationship needs some counseling
So I should call it quits


I cant stand to see you with somebody else
Whining and dining somebody else
Rolling in your whip with somebody else
So I'd rather stay than to see u baby
Kissing and hugging somebody else
At your crib making love to somebody else
Introducing your mama to somebody else
So I'd rather stay than to see you baby


Its obvious its some misunderstandings
For my girl there is no other standing
I know it seems crazy at times
Stuttering seems like im lying

But cant nobody get it like you do
The way I feel for you is hundred proof
Before I was out of control
Now I cant let you go
There is no reason for you to walk away
Just stay
You can never be replaced
I swear
In the past it was hard for you to trust I see
But at last you can find some security in me girl

 Somebody else
 I wont be with
 Somebody else
 No, no, no, no, no
 Somebody else
 So I'd rather stay than to see you baby
 Im not kissing and touching
- Somebody else
 At the crib getting down with
 Somebody else
 Dont worry bout mama and
 Somebody else
 So I'd rather stay than to see that baby


Baby I refuse to let you go
She aint picking up where I left off
And though we fuss and fight
I aint met no other chick
Nothing like me


Baby it dont matter who's right or wrong
At the end of the night I'll be at home
With you
 I cant stand to see you with somebody else
 You give me no reason to be with


Somebody else
 Whining and dining
Somebody else
 Rolling in your whip with
Somebody else
 So I'd rather stay than to see you baby
Kissing and hugging somebody else
 I dont wanna cuz you make love to me
At your crib making love to somebody else
 So I'd rather stay than to see you baby

Somebody else
ooh
Somebody else
ooh
