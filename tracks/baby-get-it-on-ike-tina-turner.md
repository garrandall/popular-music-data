You don't know girl how you blow my mind
I said now, baby, won't you hear what I say?
I want your lovin' in the worst darn way
So come on, baby, let's get it on

Well, you're the finest girl I ever found in my life
I wanna stick to you like white on white
So come on, baby, let's get it on

Now I said, now baby
Baby, baby, get it on

You know that I've been waiting too doggone long
So come on, baby, let's get it on
Now you don't want me enough for me to turn me on
Come on, baby, what you're waitin' on?

Come on, baby
Baby, baby, get it on

Now you're the finest girl, just as fine as can be
I want every joy for you and me
So come on, baby, let's get it on

Now I said now
