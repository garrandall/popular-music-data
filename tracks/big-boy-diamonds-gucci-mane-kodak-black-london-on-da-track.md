Big boy diamonds
Ice on me changin' the climate
She like the way I be vibin'
This ain't a grill, ice on my teeth here is permanent
Bought a new gun and I dirtied it
I'm a burglar and a murderer, try me
I'm a burglar and a murderer, try me
Big boy diamonds
Ice on me changin' the climate
She like the way I be vibin'
Big boy diamonds

Beat down your lady's vagina
Rockin' the latest designer
Pull up like abracadabra, boo hoo
Pull right back up in a Jag with voodoo
Milkin' these bitches like Yoo-hoo
Shit on these niggas like doo doo
I'm passin' gas like I farted
Boy, if you smelled it, you dealt it
Water on me like I'm meltin', water
Fuck on your daughter, don't call her, water
Come on, lil bitch, I'm your father, water
Call me "Daddy", I'm your papi
Comin' over, drop the addy
I was on Xannies already
I be on mollys already
Fuck all the talkin', I been done shot 'em already

Big boy diamonds
Ice on me changin' the climate
She like the way I be vibin'
This ain't a grill, ice on my teeth here is permanent
Bought a new gun and I dirtied it
I'm a burglar and a murderer, try me
I'm a burglar and a murderer, try me
Big boy diamonds
Ice on me changin' the climate
She like the way I be vibin'
Big boy diamonds

I'm gon' be icy in Heaven
Diamonds on me and they white like a wife at the wedding
I done shot dice with my celly
I taught a lifer a lesson
I put that knife on the peasant
I bought the choppers already
Gucci the GOAT, but you know it already
Scope on the rifle, I'm holdin' it steady
Diamond AP like Elvis Presley, dance
Play like you hard, but you sweeter than jelly
Bitch, I'm the shit, it ain't shit you can tell me
Her stomach on flat, so my dick in her belly
Think I'm at least spend a brick on her Presi'
Christmas, I want a stick for a present
Bugatti ship hard, it's factory setting
Run up on 'Wop and you'll never forget it
I broke the dam, I told 'em to flood it
I want the cash, I'm done with the credit
Went in my stash and gave me a budget
My pockets so bulgin'
That bitches is callin' me handsome
That then was callin' me ugly
I caught a rash from countin' the money
I'm changin' the climate like global warming
She seen the charm and said I'm charming
The watch on my arm, it come with army

Big boy diamonds
Ice on me changin' the climate
She like the way I be vibin'
This ain't a grill, ice on my teeth here is permanent
Bought a new gun and I dirtied it
I'm a burglar and a murderer, try me
I'm a burglar and a murderer, try me
Big boy diamonds
Ice on me changin' the climate
She like the way I be vibin'
Big boy diamonds
