How ya doin' sweetheart?
Heya, you know these last few months we've been together
Happened so right and I'm just so happy for what we shared
I've been wonderin', how do you feel?


I wanna get lost in love with you
And do all the things you want me to
Caress your body, touch your soul
'Cause boy I love you so
I wanna get lost in love with you
And do all the things you want me to
Caress your body touch your soul
'Cause boy I love you so


The love we shared something so especial
Es tan contigo is all I wanna do every night
Ever since el primer dia, the first day
I knew it'd last forever if I had it my way
So the days go on, no hago otra cosa
But dream about the moment, our hearts will come closer
Holdin' tu mano in your face tan bonita
Never met another young lady senorita
And that is why I gotta say that you're the best
A millon and one ways just to express
Mi amor I know that we will be together
So, sing to me, baby, and sing forever


I wanna be with you always
Together forever 'til our ending days
Hold me baby don't let go
Makin' love like never before
I wanna be with you always
Together forever 'til our ending days
Hold me baby don't let go
Makin' love like never before


Makin' love in the night time, walks and romance
I'm telling you, hermosa, my heart is in a trance
They say that true love is so hard to find
I thank the man up above for makin' you mine
Talkin' on the telephone, sendin' you kisses
A dozen of roses just to say that I am missin'
The warmth of your body right next to mine
Eres tu la mejor like a toast of fine wine
Out to the movies, maybe sharing some ice cream
Si estoy dormido, don't wake me from my dream
Todo lo que quiero, all I need is your affection
My life was fine but you brought perfection
Now we sit here just holdin' hands
Whispers in my ear tell me that I'll be your man
Today, manana in a paradise for two
I feel the same way 'cause I'm so in love with you


I love the way you make me feel
My love for you is all so real
Embrace my body, touch me softly
Love me 'til the morning
I love the way you make me feel
My love for you is all so real
Embrace my body, touch me softly
Love me 'til the morning


You know that love we shared is just something so special
The tenderness
I just don't know what to say, girl
Would you sing to me one more time?
Do it like this, come on


I wanna get lost in love with you
And do all the things you want me to
Caress your body, touch your soul
'Cause boy I love you so
I wanna be with you always
Together forever 'til our ending days
Hold me baby, don't let go
Makin' love like never before
