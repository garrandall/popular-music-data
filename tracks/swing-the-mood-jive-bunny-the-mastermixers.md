1-2
1-2
1-1-1-1-2-3-o'clock
4 o'clock
5-6-7- o'clock
8 o'clock
9-10-11 o'clock
12 o'clock rock
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
Well, if you like my song join behind
We'll have some fun while the clock straights one
We're gonna rock, rock, rock, rock, till ray light come
We're gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock tonight
RRRock rock everybody
Roll, roll, roll, everybody
Rock, rock, rock, everybody
Roll, roll, roll, everybody
Rock, rock, rock, everybody
Rock, move, baby
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, babaluma
Bump, bump, bump, babaluma
Bump, bump, babaluma
Balan, bump, bump, bump
(Eh) bump (eh) bump (eh-eh-eh-eh-eh) bump
(eh-eh-eh-eh-eh)

Wake up little Susie, wake up
Wake up little Susie, wake up
We're both inside a sleep
Wake up little Susie and dropped the movie's over
It's 4 o'clock and we're in trouble deep
Wake up little Susie wake up littel Susie
We gotta go home

UUUUU
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
You're crying all the time
You make up looking like a hound dog
Crying all the time
We'll you ain't ever called a rammin' and you're ain't
No friend of mine

Shake, shake, shake, shake, rattle and roll I said
Shake, rattle and roll, I said
Shake, rattle and roll, I said
Shake, rattle and roll

Oh with the bless of my soul, oh won't you
Roll with me, I met you like a man on a fossil tree
My friend said I might think what's the bog
I made for love, I'm all shook up

RRRRock one threw a party in the canned jail
The prison band was here
They began the whole
The band was jumpin' and they jumped again the swing
You should've heard the knock out jail
First singing
Let's rock, everybody let's rock everybody
In the whole state of rock will dance
In the jails of rock

Ah ah ah ah
Bump, bump
