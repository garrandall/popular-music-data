Now, I don't need to travel farâ¨
And I don't need to be a star
â¨I don't need no one, to tell me if I'm rightâ¨
You're the only one that matters in my life

I was made to love youâ¨
Love you, love you aloneâ¨
Yes, I was made to love you
â¨Love you, love you alone

I don't think I can pretend, no
â¨'Cause baby, you're more than just a friendâ¨
We grew up together, living separate lives
â¨Now, we need each other, what a big surprise

I was made to love youâ¨
Love you, love you aloneâ¨
Yes, I was made to love you
â¨Love you, love you alone

Love you, love youâ¨
Love you, love you alone
â¨I was made to love

Behind my dreams are thoughts and feelings
â¨They're tellin' me life lines never change
â¨I believe in karma and I believe in you
â¨And I feel somehow you believe in me too

I was made to love youâ¨
Love you, love you alone
â¨I was made to love youâ¨
Love you, love you alone

I was made to love you
â¨Love you, love you alone
â¨I was made to love youâ¨
Yes, I was made to love
