I remember when we first started
You came to me and you were broken hearted
I took you in and wiped all your tears away
I gave you loving more than any other gave
Don't you know I'm the one and I love you girl
I don't care what they say you know you are my world
Come back home to the one
Who loves you more and more
Soon you'll see that it was me you were searchin for

Oh my love searching for
I really need you
I really want you baby
I need you and I want you baby
Spring love - come back to me
I gotta have you baby

I can remember the first time we ever met
The sun was shining
Love was gleaming in the air
You caught my eye and the next thing that I knew
I was in love - I was so in love with you
We were so close for a season of my life
I wanted so much to have you for my wife
But something changed
Season came to an end
I had to leave you
And that's where my heartache began

Spring love come back to me
I need you and I want you baby
Spring love come back to me
I really need you
I gotta have you baby
Springtime love is on my mind and I won't forget
The way we shared the way we cared
And I don't regret it
I don't regret it - come back to me darlin
Springtime love is on my mind
And I won't forget
Come back to me darlin
The way we shared the way we cared
I really need you my springtime lover
