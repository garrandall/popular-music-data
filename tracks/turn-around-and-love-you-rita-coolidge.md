Never in my life before
Have I ever cried
The way I've cried for you
Because you abuse me
To amuse your friends
And you use me
That's where your story ends

And I turn around
And love you, baby

Never in my wildest dreams
Even when I made believe
I knew I'd never own you
No, I've never really known you

But I turn around
And I love you, baby

And even though I can
Never really know for sure
What's in your heart
I'm gonna hold on

Knowing that you're
The hurting kind
And if the day ever comes
When you say you're
Gonna leave me

I would lose my mind
Every day and every little way
Everything I do or say
I do for you

But you abuse me
To amuse your friends
And you use me
That's where your story ends

And I turn around
And love you, baby

I turn around and love you
Oh, yeah
I'm always thinking of you
Oh, yeah
I turn around and love you
Oh, yeah
I'm always thinking of you
