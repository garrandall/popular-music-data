Friday night, I'd just got back
I had my eyes shut, was dreamin' 'bout the past
I thought about you while the radio played
I should have got movin', some reason I stayed

I started driftin' to a different place
I realized I was fallin' off the face of your world
And there was nothin' left to bring me back

I'm a million miles away
A million miles away
I'm just a million miles away, away, away
And there's nothin' left to bring me back today

Took a ride, went downtown
The streets were empty, there was no one around
To the place that we used to know
Been all the places we used to go

I'm at the wrong end of the lookin' glass
Just tryin' to hold on to the hands of the past and you
And there was nothin' left to bring me back

I was a million miles away
A million miles away, away, away, away
I'm just a million miles away
And there's nothin' to bring me back today
Bring me back today
Bring me back today

I started driftin' to a different place
I realized, fallin' off the face of your world
And there was nothin' left to bring me back

I'm just a million miles away
I'm a million miles away
I'm a million miles away, away, away, away
And there's nothin' left to bring me back today
Bring me back today
Bring me back today, today, today
Bring me back today
