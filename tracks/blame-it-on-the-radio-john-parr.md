Blame it on the moonlight, blame it on the radio
I just wanna hold her tight, and never let her go
Maybe its her blue eyes, or maybe its her sweet hello
I just know it feels so right, I gotta let her know

Yeah!

Whos that girl walking down the street, whos that girl I got to meet
Sexy dress, cut with style, she makes me weak, she drives me wild

I got her number written on my hand, its more than I can stand

Blame it on the moonlight, blame it on the radio
I just wanna hold her tight, and never let her go
Maybe its her blue eyes, or maybe its her sweet hello
I just know it feels so right, I gotta let her know

Whos that girl, I got to know, whos that girl, I can't let go

Hot n bothered, I can't sleep at night, one kiss could make it right

Blame it on the moonlight, blame it on the radio
I just wanna hold her tight, and never let her go
Maybe its her blue eyes, or maybe its her sweet hello
I just wanna know, blame the radio, blame the radio

I always seem to be the lonely one
Maybe someday Ill be the only one, the only one

Blame it on the moonlight, blame it on the radio
Blame it on me, blame it on you, oh
Blame it on the radio, blame it on the radio
Blame it on your father, oh your mother, blame it on anyone, anyone
Blame it on the radio, the radio, the radio, the radio... (to fade)
