You better wake up, little Johnny
Better wake up real
soon
The time has come now
For me and you

Spent
those years dreaming
But the dreams didn't
last
Time is moving much too fast
Turn the radio
on

Well they built those factories
With blood,
sweat and steel
Coming down fast under
The weight of the
wheel

Hey, little Johnny
There ain't no room
for you
Tell me, Johnny
Am I getting
through?


Turn the radio on
With every
beat of the drum
Then go out in the streets
With the
voice of America's sons
There ain't no one
today
Tonight someone will play
Out in the
streets

Hear the voice of America's sons

Well,
they're fighting in the jungles
And they're
fighting in the streets
They're playing those
games
Man, they're playing for keeps

Hey,
little Johnny
When they call on you
Tell me,
Johnny
What are you gonna
do?



Turn the radio on
Turn the
radio on



Turn the radio on
With
every beat of the drum
Then go out in the streets
Hear
the voice of America's sons

Turn the radio
on
With every beat of the drum
Then go out in the
streets
Hear the voice of America's sons
