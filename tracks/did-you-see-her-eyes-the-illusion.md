Hey, hey now

Well now here she comes, walking down the street
Well now here she comes, walking down the street

Did you see her eyes
Did you see her eyes
Did you see her eyes
Yeah, yeah, yeah, now

Well now here she comes, walking down my street, alright
Well now here she comes, ah, she looks so sweet

She can make you feel so good
She can make you feel so fine
She can make you feel so good
If you give her time, she can blow your mind

Naaaaaa, na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na

Well now here she comes, she looks so sweet
Well now here she comes, she looks so fine
Well now here she comes, I'm gonna make her mine
