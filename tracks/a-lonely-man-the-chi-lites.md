Ah-ah-ah...
Doo-doo-doo-doo, you better let me tell ya
Ah-ah-ah...
Doo-doo-doo-doo, you better let me tell ya

You know, some time ago
Our pathways parted
Now you may have found bliss
Yeah, but I found regret

Maybe you can smile
Maybe even laugh
Yeah, but all the while
I'm trying to forget

Tears cannot express my grief
Nor words my loneliness
For they can only tell a part
And let my heart tell you the rest

I would season every day of my life with you
You better let me tell ya
I would show you just what it means to be true, girl
You better let me tell ya

Cause after love has come and gone
Baby, I'm the lonely one
Oh...
But why should a man be lonely
(Why should a man be lonely, why should a man be lonely)
When he has someone like you

How can I make you believe
That I got to have you, baby (got to have you, baby)
Yes, I got to have you, baby (got to have you, baby)
Oh, I got to have you, baby (got to have you, baby)

I would sweeten every hour of my day with you
You better let me tell ya
I would give you all the things a good lady would need
You better let me tell ya

For you I'd save up all of my time
Give you every dime
For you, girl, you better let me tell ya

Cause after love has come and gone
Baby, I'm the lonely one
Oh...
But why should a man be lonely
(Why should a man be lonely, why should a man be lonely)
When he has someone like you

How can I make you believe
That I got to have you, baby (got to have you, baby)
Yes, I got to have you, baby (got to have you, baby)
Oh, I got to have you, baby (got to have you, baby)

I got to travel on
Down life's highway
Searching faces
Some old, some new
Seeking someone whom I need the most
I know there can't be two
Yeah, I'm searching for someone
Who's the closest thing to you

Gotta go on, gotta go on
I'm so lonely, I gotta go
I'm so lonely, gotta go, yeah
Oh, I just gotta go

I said, baby, baby, baby, baby, oh
I just-just-just-just got to go (I've got to go, I've got to go)
I'm so lonely (hey), I gotta go (oh)
I'm so lonely, gotta go, yeah
(Gotta go on, yeah, yeah)
(Oh, I gotta go, I gotta go, I just gotta go, yeah)
Gotta go on, gotta go on

I'm so lonely, I gotta go, I'm so lonely, yeah, yeah
I've just gotta go
Hey, hey, got to, got to, oh, I got to, I just to go on
(I've got to go, I've got go)
I'm so lonely (hey), I gotta go (oh)
I'm so lonely
