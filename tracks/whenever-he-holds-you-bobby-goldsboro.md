Take your little heart
Tear it all apart
Make the teardrops fall
From your eyes
And you'll know how I feel
When he holds you
Whenever he holds you

Pretend no one loves you
Make believe you're blue

And if you get an empty feeling deep inside
Then you'll know how I feel
When he holds you
Whenever he holds you

My friends say forget you
I know I should try
But whenever he holds you, I feel I could die

But if you ever find
That I'm still on your mind
Maybe you'll come back to my arms

Till then I'll cry
When he holds you
Whenever he holds you
