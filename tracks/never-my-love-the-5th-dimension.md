I promised to take her the the sun
And I gave her the night
And now that the dawn breaks at last she is vanished
From sigh
Here's now that I'm finally learned a few things that
Could bring her the bright.

No...
It'll never be the same again
Never be the same
It'll never be the same again
Never be the same
It'll never be the same again
O' right...

I read her the points I loved when she spent that first
Night
And we disgusted everything from my friends to a "put
Her so tight"
And now that some time is gone by and I think I can
R The hi
No
It'll never be the same again
Never be the same
It'll never be the same again
Never be the same
It'll never be the same again
O' right

How many mistakes can you make just getting by?
And out can the worst worrying emptyer then they prayes
I would try
What is it they can take love and reduce it into a
Sigh

No
It'll never be the same again
Never be the same
It'll never be the same again
Never be the same
It'll never be the same again
O' right...

No
It'll never be the same again
Never be the same
It'll never be the same again
Never be the same
It'll never be the same again
O' right
