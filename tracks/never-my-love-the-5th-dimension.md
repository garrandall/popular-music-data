You ask me if there will come a time
When I grow tired of you
Never my love
Never my love
You wonder if this heart of mine
Will lose its desire for you
Never my love
Never my love
What makes you think love will end
When you know that my whole life depends on you
Never my love
Never my love

You say you feel I'll change my mind
And I won't require you
Never my love
No never, never my love
How can you think love will end
When I asked you to spend your whole life with me
I need you never my love
Oh, believe me baby
I want you forever and ever my love
I wanna be yours
