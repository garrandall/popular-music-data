 You Might need a passport for this one 
 Its internacional 
 J. Holiday! 
 And we got a special Guess 
 Guess who...Boss! 
 You know sometimes ladies they move to fast and they choose the wrong one 
 Yea! 
 But if you like me.. 
 Rite 
 We just might take yours back 
 I'm with that 
 Like repossession 
 Belive that 


By the way that you scream my name 
I put a talk that you aint been claimed 
Now you up in here with that lame 
Looking back you chose the wrong lover 
(thats the wrong dude over there Baby) 
And I can tell that you feel the same 
You see me your expression change 
I dont want To approach or disrespect 
So I text you I gotta have you tonight 


So lets do it again 
Meet me at the spot 
So we can Dot dot dot-dot dot dot 
Alright (Alright) 
She hit me back like 3 O'clock 


Its the way that you walk smooth (so sexy) 
The way that You move oooh 
Girl I cant let You escape I have to reposses u stay 
Its the way that you walk smooth 
The way that You move oooh 
Since that night you was all mines 
You realized you chose the wrong lover 


By the way that You play your game 
Put a talk that your field done changed 
But baby now all you can say for yourself is I love ya 
And its written all on your face (all over your face) 
That you wanna meet me at your place 
I dont want To approach or disrespect 
So I text baby whats up for tonight (sup baby deal with me) 


So lets do it again 
Meet me at the spot 
So we can Dot dot dot-dot dot dot 
Alright (Alright) 
She hit me back like 3 O'clock 



I need you baby 
Ridin with that sucker Not a good look 
Not a good Look! 
Not frontin baby I Got more paper than Him to 
Not being arrogant or am I? 


I shines on a rainy night 
My new mercedes bright 
I let her hit the smoke 
Me knowing this how ladys like it 
We counting thousand stacks 
Im on my 89th 
She on her 21st 
Feel like a pretty curse 
But then the tables turn 
She actin like she aint concerned 
Running with a wide reciver cuz hes paper firm 
Another angel came 
Player got hes ankle sprained 
Out for the season now she see that things are not the same 
She made the wrong choice picked the wrong man 
But baby I forgive now get with the program 
Its ricky ross jholiday You a star and I got the perfect part to play
