Everybody shake
Everybody groove
Everybody shake

Mary, Mary, you're on my mind
Folks are gone and
The place will be mine
Aw, Mary, Mary, wanna be with you

And this is what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna put a call to you
Cause I feel good tonight
And everything's gonna
Be right, right, right, yeah

I'm gonna have a good time tonight
Rock and roll music gonna play all night
Come on, baby, it won't take long
Only take a minute just to sing my song

Boney Maroney's gonna be with him
I said long tall Sally gonna be with Slim
Short fat Fanny's is gonna
Gonna be there too

And this is what I'm gonna do
I've got to put a call to you
Cause I feel good tonight
And everything's gonna
Be right, right, right

I'm gonna have a good time tonight
Rock and roll music gonna play all night
Come on, baby, it won't take long
Only take a minute just to sing my song

I gotta talk to you

Wow, long tall Sally gonna be with him
Short fat Fanny's gonna be there too

And this is what I'm gonna do

Cause I feel good tonight
And everything's gonna
Be right, right, right

I'm gonna have a good time tonight
Rock and roll music gonna play all night
Come on, baby, it won't take long
Only take a minute just to sing my song

Rock and roll music gonna play all night
Come on, baby, it won't take long
Only take a minute just to sing my song
