No, no, no, no
Don't phunk with my heart
Yeah
No, no, no, no
Don't phunk with my heart


I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby? (Love, love)
In love, baby (Love, love)
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby? (Love, love)
In love, baby (ove, love)


Girl, you know you got me, got me
With your pistol shot me, shot me
And I'm here helplessly
In love and nothing can stop me
You can't stop me once I start it
Can't return me once you bought it
I'm coming, baby, don't doubt it
(Don't make me wait) So let's be about it


No, no, no, no
Don't phunk with my heart


Baby, have some trustin', trustin'
When I come with lustin', lustin'
'Cause I'll bring you that comfort
I ain’t only here 'cause I want your
Body, I want your mind too
Interestin' what I find you
And I'm interested in the long haul
Come on girl, yee-haw!
Come on


I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby? (Love, love)
In love, baby (Love, love)
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby? (Love, love)
In love, baby (Love, love)


No, no, no, no
Don't phunk with my heart


Girl, you had me once you kissed me
My love for you is not iffy
I always want you wit me
I'll play Bobby and you play Whitney (all long)
If you smoke I smoke too
That's how much I'm in love wit chu
Crazy is what crazy do
Crazy in love, I'm a crazy fool


No, no, no, no
Don't phunk with my heart


Why you so in-sa-cure
When you got passionate love hurr?
You always claimin' I'm a cheatah
Think I'll up and go leave ya
For another señorita
You forgot that I need ya
You must have caught amnesia
That's why you don't believe-a
Wha'- yeah - check it out


Don't ya worry about a thing, baby
'Cause ya know ya got me by a string, baby
Don't ya worry about a thing, baby
'Cause ya know ya got me by a string, baby


Baby girl, ya make me feel...
You know you make me feel so real...
I love you more than sex appeal...
'Cause ya


That-that-that-that-that-that-girl
That-that-that-that-that-that-girl
That-that-that-that-that-that-girl
That-that-that-that-that-that-girl
That-that-that-that-that-that-girl
That-that-that-that-that-that-girl


No, no, no, no (That-that-that-that-that-that-girl)
Don't phunk with my heart (That-that-that-that-that-that-girl)
No, no, no, no
Don't phunk with my heart


I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby? (Love, love)
In love, baby (Love, love)
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby? (Love, love)
In love, baby (Love, love)
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby? (Love, love)
In love, baby (Love, love)
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby? (Love, love)
In love, baby (Love, love)


Don't ya worry about a thing, baby
'Cause ya know ya got me by a string, baby
Don't ya worry about a thing, baby
'Cause ya know ya got me by a string, baby
