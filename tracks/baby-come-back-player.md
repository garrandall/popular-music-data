Spendin' all my nights, all my money goin' out on the town
Doin' anythin' just to get you off of my mind
But when the mornin' comes, I'm right back where I started again
And tryin' to forget you is just a waste of time


Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was somethin' in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without you


All day long, I'm wearin' a mask of false bravado
Tryin' to keep up a smile that hides a tear
But as the sun goes down, I get that empty feelin' again
How I wish to God that you were here


Baby come back, oh baby, any kind of fool could see
There was somethin' in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without you, oh


Now that I put it all together, oh-oh
Give me the chance to make you see
Have you used up all the love in your heart?
Nothing left for me? Ain't there nothing left for me?


Baby come back, oh darling, any kind of fool could see
There was somethin' in everything about you
Baby come back, listen baby, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without you
I was wrong and I just can't live
