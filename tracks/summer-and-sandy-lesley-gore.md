Oh what a day to take a ride, my baby's by my side
Top down, beach bound
Music on the radio that makes you wanna go
Sky high, my guy
Picks me up and makes my world aglow
You oughta know


Sandy, summer and Sandy
No rainy days (no rainy days)
All summer long
Coming on strong with


Sandy, summer and Sandy
Breaking away (breaking away)
Grooving along
With summer and Sandy (Sandy, Sandy, Sandy)
Salty air and harbor lights and lazy summer nights
Boardwalk, small talk
And gazing into Sandy's eyes and stars up in the skies
My love, I love
Everything about him that I see
And he loves me

Oh, oh baby, oh
Sandy, I love him, I love him
Sandy, oh love him, I love him
