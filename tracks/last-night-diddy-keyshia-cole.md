Last night, I couldn't even get an answer
I tried to call, but my pride wouldn't let me dial
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child


I know you can hear me
I know you can feel me
I can't live without you
Girl, please make me better
I wish I wasn't the way I am


If I told you once, I told you twice
You can see it in my eyes
I'm all cried out, with nothing to say
You're everything I wanted to be
If you could only see, it all belongs to me
I love you so much, I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free, forever yours, I'll be
Baby, won't you come and take this pain away?


Last night, I couldn't even get an answer
(You said you couldn't get an answer, baby)
I tried to call, but my pride wouldn't let me dial
(That should never stop you)
And I'm sitting here (Sitting there) with this blank expression
(I can't read your mind, baby)
And the way I feel (The way I feel), I wanna curl up like a child
(Ooh baby)


I need you and you need me
This is so plain to see
And I would never let you go
And I will always love you so, I will
If you could only see, your heart belongs to me
I love you so much, I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free, forever yours, I'll be
Baby, won't you come and take this pain away


Last night (Oh, last night), I couldn't even get an answer
(Oh baby, what you wanna do to me?)
I tried to call (Alright), but my pride wouldn't let me dial
(Why would you just hurt me, baby? Oh)
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression
(Don't save me baby, don't, no)
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child
(I'm so alone, I'm so lonely, baby, oh)


Tell me what words to say to make you come back
Don't break me like that (Ooh)
And if it matters, I'd rather stay home (Baby)
With you, I'm never alone
Don't wanna wait 'til you're gone
Whatever you do, just don't leave me


Last night (Yeah), I couldn't even get an answer (Didn't get an answer, baby)
(Oh) I tried to call (Call me, baby), but my pride wouldn't let me dial
(Oh, couldn't you just dial me, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby?)
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression (Don't sit there, no)
And the way I feel (Alright, yeah), I wanna curl up like a child
(I'm so alone, I'm so lonely, baby, oh)


I need you and you need me (I need you)
This is so plain to see
And I would never let you go
And I will always love you so, I will
If you could only see, your heart belongs to me (Belongs to me)
I love you so much (So, so), I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free, forever yours, I'll be
Baby, won't you come and take my pain away?


Last night, I couldn't even get an answer (I couldn't get you, baby, yeah, oh)
I tried to call (Call me, baby), but my pride wouldn't let me dial
(Why couldn't you just dial me, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby?)
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression (Don't sit there, no)
And the way I feel (Alright, yeah), I wanna curl up like a child
(I'm so alone, I'm so lonely, baby)


Why don't you pick up the phone and dial up my number?
And call me up, baby, I'm waiting on you
Why don't you pick up the phone and dial up my number?
Just call me up, baby, I'm waiting on you


{Phone dialing and ringing}
"Hello
Hey what's-up
I've been tryin' to reach you all night
That shit ain't funny not picking up the motherfucking phone
Better stop fucking playing with a nigga's feelings like that
You know how much I love you, right?
But for them couple of seconds though
When I couldn't get in touch with you
I'm ready to come over your house and shoot that motherfucker up
You better fucking not be there when I get over that house
{Laughing}
That's really how it goes down, right?"
