Last night. 
I couldn't even get an answer.
I tried to call but my pride wouldn't let me dial.
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression.
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child.

I know you can hear me.
I know you can feel me.
I can't live without you.
God, please make me betta.
I wish I wasn't the way I am.


If I told you once, I told you twice.
You can see it in my eyes.
I'm all cried out with nothing to say.
You're everything I wanted to be.
If you could only see your hearts belongs to me.
I love you so much.
I'm yearning for your touch.
Come and set me free.
Forever yours I'll be.
Baby, won't you come and take this pain away.


Last night. 
I couldn't even get an answer. (You said you couldn't get an answer baby)
I tried to call but my pride wouldn't let me dial. (But that should never stop you)
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression. (Sitting there, I can't reach your mind baby)
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child. (The way I feel, a baby)


I need you and you need me.
This is so plain to see.
And I would never let you go.
And I will always love you so.
I will...

If you could only see your hearts belongs to me.
I love you so much.
I'm yearning for your touch.
Come and set me free.
Forever yours I'll be.
Baby, won't you come and take this pain away.


Last night. (Oh, last night)
I couldn't even get an answer. (Baby why you wanna do me, yeah)
I tried to call but my pride wouldn't let me dial. (Why won't you just call me baby oh?)
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression. (Don't sit there baby, no, no, no)
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child. ( Alright, I'm so alone; I'm so lonely, baby)


Tell me what there is to say to make you come back.
Don't break me like that.
And if it matters I'd rather spend my life with you. 
I'm never alone.
Whenever you're home just phone me.


Last night. (Yeah)
I couldn't even get an answer. (Couldn't get an answer baby, oh)
I tried to call but my pride wouldn't let me dial. (Call me baby, why couldn't you just dial
me baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby)
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression. (Don't sit there, no)
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child. (Alright, I'm so alone, I'm so lonely baby)


I need you and you need me. (Need you, I need you)
This is so plain to see.
And I would never let you go.
And I will always love you so.
I will...

If you could only see your hearts belongs to me. (Only see)
I love you so much. (So, so)
I'm yearning for your touch.
Come and set me free.
Forever yours I'll be.
Baby, won't you come and take my pain away. (Hey)


Last night. 
I couldn't even get an answer. (I couldn't catch you baby, no)
I tried to call but my pride wouldn't let me dial. (Call me baby, why couldn't you just dial
me baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby)
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression. (Don't sit there, no)
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child. (Alright, I'm so alone; I'm so lonely, baby)


Why don't you pick up the phone and dial up my number?
And call me my baby.
I'm waiting on you.
Why don't you pick up the phone and dial up my number?
Just call me up baby.
I'm waiting on you.
