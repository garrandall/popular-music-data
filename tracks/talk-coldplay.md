Oh, brother I can't, I can't get through
I’ve been trying hard to reach you 'cause I don’t know what to do
Oh, brother, I can't believe it's true
I’m so scared about the future and I wanna talk to you
Oh, I wanna talk to you


You can take a picture of something you see
In the future where will I be?
You can climb a ladder up to the Sun
Or write a song nobody has sung
Or do something that's never been done


Are you lost or incomplete?
Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?
Tell me how do you feel
Well, I feel like they're talking in a language I don't speak
And they're talking it to me


So you take a picture of something you see
In the future where will I be?
You can climb a ladder up to the Sun
Or write a song nobody has sung
Or do something that's never been done
Or do something that's never been done


So you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk?
And you feel like you're going where you've been before?
You tell anyone who'll listen, but you feel ignored?
Nothing's really making any sense at all, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk, let's talk
