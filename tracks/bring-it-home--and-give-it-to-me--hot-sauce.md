I didn't mean to make you mad
Tears me up to see you sad
I know it's true
(It's true)
I don't know what to do
Don't see how I can go through life without you
(Without you)
You're always fine and tryna please
Not what you want but what you need
I'm gonna give it to you
My heart and I on bended knees
Cryin': "Baby, baby please come on home to me"
Baby, baby


Bring it home
(Bring it home)
Give it to me
(Give it to me)
Hurry up
(Hurry up)
Lay it on me, lay it on me, yeah (Lay it on me)
Runnin' blind throughout the world
'Cause I've lost the sweetest man I've ever seen
Oh, yeah
Bring it home
(Bring it home)
Give it to me
(Give it to me)
Hurry up
(Hurry up)
Lay it on me, lay it on me (Lay it on me)
I die inside each time you decide to leave
When you're gone you know it grieves me
Like it's doing now


If you think I'm havin' fun
Playin' around with anyone
I know you're wrong
(You're wrong)
You just made a big mistake
My hearts about to break
Since you been gone
(Since you been gone)
If you only knew how much I miss you
How I long to hold and kiss you
You'd come on home
You never, never put me down
Stay out on the town
Like you're doing right now
Baby


Bring it home
(Bring it home)
Give it to me
(Give it to me)
Hurry up
(Hurry up)
Lay it on me, ooh, lay it on me (Lay it on me)
Runnin' blind throughout the world
I've lost the sweetest man I've ever seen
Oh, baby
Bring it home
(Bring it home)
Give it to me
(Give it to me)
Hurry up
(Hurry up)
Lay it on me, lay it on me (Lay it on me)
(I need you baby)
I die inside each time you leave
When you're gone you know it grieves me, it grieves me


Oh, baby, baby
Bring it home
(Bring it home)
Give it to me
(Give it to me)
Hurry up
(Hurry up)
Oh, why don't you lay it on me (Lay it on me)
(I need you baby)
