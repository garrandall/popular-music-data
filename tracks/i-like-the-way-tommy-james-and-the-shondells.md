Hey, be comin' on so nice to me
And let you think it ain't so hard to see.
You're not actin' like you know you should
And that's no good. No.

You know you shouldn't look at me that way.
'Cause when you do, you know I wanna stay.
You make me wish my heart was made of wood
And that's no good.
I'm taken and you'd just be fakin' your heart out.
I'm taken and you'd be mistaken to start out.
'Cause I'm not out for love.

I've got somebody who's so good to me.
But if I didn't, I'd be glad to be
The one to live you like nobody could. I could.
But I'm taken and you'd just be fakin' your heart out.
I'm taken and you'd be mistaken to start out.
'Cause I'm not out for love. No.

I'm taken and you'd just be fakin' your heart out.
I'm taken and you'd be mistaken to start out.
