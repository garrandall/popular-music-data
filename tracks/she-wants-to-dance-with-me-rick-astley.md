She wants to dance
She wants to dance with me
Oh yeah (dance with me)

There's a girl I've been waiting to see
And I really get the feeling that she likes me
'Cos she said so, but not in so many words
I've got to tell you what I've heard

She don't want no wild romance
When she's with me she only wants to dance

She wants to dance with me
'Cos I'll hold her so tight next to me
She wants to dance with me
'Cos I'll let her be what she wants to be

Now I know I've been out of touch
And I never meant to hurt my baby oh so much
'Cos I love her and I think she love me
And that's the way it's got to be

When we're together we never fight
We've got better things to do tonight

She wants to dance with me
'Cos I'll hold her so tight next to me
She wants to dance with me
'Cos I'll let her be what she wants to be

She wants to dance
She wants to dance

She wants to dance with me
'Cos I'll hold her so tight next to me
She wants to dance with me
'Cos I'll let her be what she wants to be
