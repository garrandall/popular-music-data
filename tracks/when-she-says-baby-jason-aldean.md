Some days itâs tough just gettinâ up
Throwinâ on these boots and makinâ that climb
Some days Iâd rather be a no show
Lay low âfore I go out of my mind

But when she says baby
Oh donât matter what comes
Ainât goinâ nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair
And saves me
Yeah that look in her eyes got me cominâ alive
And drivinâ me a good kind a crazy
When she says baby
Oh when she says baby

Some nights I come home fightinâ mad
Feel like runninâ my fist through the wall
Is it even worth what Iâm fightinâ for anymore
Feelinâ torn, oh the hell with it all

But when she says baby
Oh donât matter what comes
Ainât goinâ nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair
And saves me
Yeah that look in her eyes got me cominâ alive
And drivinâ me a good kind a crazy
When she says baby
Oh when she says baby

Everything gonna be alright
Just lay down by my side
Let me love you through this life

Sheâs a perfect shot of faith
When every bit of mine is gone
Somethinâ I can believe in
A best friend, a heaven sent
Love to lean on

But when she says baby
Oh donât matter what comes
Ainât goinâ nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair
And saves me
Yeah that look in her eyes got me cominâ alive
And drivinâ me a good kind a crazy
When she says baby
Oh when she says baby

Yeah that look in her eyes got me cominâ alive
And drivinâ me a good kind a crazy
