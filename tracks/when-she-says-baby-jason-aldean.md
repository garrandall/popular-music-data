Some days it's tough just getting up
Throwing on these boots and making that climb
Some days I would rather be a no show or lay low
'Fore I go out of my mind


But when she says baby (baby)
Oh, no matter what comes, ain't going nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair and saves me (saves me)
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me coming alive
And driving me a good kind of crazy
When she says baby
Oh, when she says baby


Some nights I come home fighting mad
Feel like running my fist through the wall
Is it even worth what I'm fighting for anymore
Feeling torn, aw, to hell with it all


But when she says baby (baby)
Oh, no matter what comes, ain't going nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair and saves me (saves me)
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me coming alive
And driving me a good kind of crazy
When she says baby


Everything gonna be alright
Just lay down by my side
Let me love you through this life


Yeah, she's a perfect shot of faith
When every bit of mine is gone
Something I can believe in, a best friend
A heaven sent love to lean on


But when she says baby (baby)
Oh, no matter what comes, ain't going nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair and saves me (saves me)
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me coming alive
And driving me a good kind of crazy
When she says baby
Oh, when she says baby


Yeah, that look in her eye's got me coming alive
And driving me a good kind of crazy
