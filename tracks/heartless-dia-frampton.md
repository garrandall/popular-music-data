In the night, I hear 'em talk,
Coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road,
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?

How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me
I mean after all the things that we've been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Yeah I know of some things that you ain't told me
I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, I got homies
In the end it's still so lonely


In the night, I hear 'em talk,
Coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road,
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?

How could you be so Dr. Evil,
You bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't gon' speak so
Why we up 3 A.M. on the phone?
Why does he's so mad at me for?
Homie I don't know, he's hot and cold
Won't stop, won't mess my groove up
'Cause I already know how this thing end


In the night, I hear 'em talk,
Coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road,
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Yeah, how could you be so heartless?

Talkin', talkin', talkin', talk
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
I'm gon' take off tonight


Into the night I hear 'em talk,
Coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road,
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?
