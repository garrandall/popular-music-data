Shame on me for hurting you
What can I say, darling
What can I do

Last night, I was blind
But today, I see
I did you wrong
I did you wrong
Shame on me

You say you won't be seeing me again
You say we're through
Well, darling, I wouldn't wanna
See the sunrise tomorrow
If I knew that to be true

I know that just saying I'm sorry
Doesn't sound like a lot
But the girl you saw me with last night
Meant no more to me than the
Thousand stars and the great clouds above

And the more I looked at her
The more I realized
How much I loved you

Shame on me for hurting you
What can I say, what can I do

I'll admit, I shouldn't have
Given in to love's wild temptations
With something I care nothing for
But, darling, I was blind and I hurt you
Can you ever forgive a fool
A fool that really loves you

Last night, I was blind
But today, I see
I did you wrong
I did you wrong
Shame on me

Oh, darling, darling
I did you wrong (shame)
I did you wrong (shame)
Shame on me

Spite me but, baby, don't leave me
I did you wrong (shame)
I did you wrong (shame)
Shame on me

I need you, baby, please...
