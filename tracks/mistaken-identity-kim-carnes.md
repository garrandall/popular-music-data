Did she tell you it's over
Did she throw you out in the night
Here you come to your other lover
Thinkin' that a restless heart
Will get you high again

But I changed the number 
On my telephone
You won't find me when you come callin'

And I'll say
Must be a case of mistaken identity
I'm not the girl you want me to be
Must be a case of mistaken identity
I'm not the girl you want me to be

Did you think I'd be waiting for you
Did you think I'd be holding my breath
To hear the songs of your footsteps
Sayin' its all over with her
And now you need me
You need me

But I changed the number 
On my telephone
You won't find me when you come callin'

And I'll say
Must be a case of mistaken identity
I'm not the girl you want me to be
Must be a case of mistaken identity
I'm not the girl you want me to be

So don't try to call me anymore with your lies
Don't be a fool and make the
Mistake of thinking I still love you
Oh anyone can tell I'm find
And I don't need you

But I've change the number 
Of my telephone
You won't find me when you come callin'

And I'll say
Must be a case of mistaken identity
I'm not the girl you want me to be
Must be a case of mistaken identity
I'm not the girl you want me to be
