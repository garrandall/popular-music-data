How gentle is the rain, that falls gently on the meadow;
Birds high upon the trees serenade the flow'rs with their melodies.
Oh, see there beyond the hill, the bright colors of the rainbow;
Some magic from above made this day for us, just to fall in love.

How gentle is the rain, that falls gently on the meadow;
Birds high upon the trees serenade the flow'rs with their melodies.
Oh, see there beyond the hill, the bright colors of the rainbow;
Some magic from above made this day for us, just to fall in love.

You'll hold me in your arms, and say once again you love me;
And if your love is true, ev'rything will be just as wonderful.

You'll hold me in your arms, and say once again you love me;
