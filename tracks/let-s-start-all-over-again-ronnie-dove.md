(Let's start all over again)
Pretend my kisses are new
(Let's start all over again)
As perfect strangers would do

Why should a word or two
In anger mean goodbye
We shared so many dreams
How can we let them die

(Let's start all over again)
While tender memories remain
(Let's put aside our foolish pride)
Or face a lifetime of pain

Oh, I just can't go on without you
Now you know how I feel about you
So don't break my heart
And let's start over again

(Let's start all over again)
Pretend my kisses are new
(Let's start all over again)
As perfect strangers would do

Oh, I just can't go on without you
Now you know how I feel about you
So don't break my heart
And let's start over again (all over again)
