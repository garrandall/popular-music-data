Take ya dusty ass next door wit' them bootlegs, man, ain't nobody want that around here

Man, this real, man. You trippin

Uh-huh, yeah

This moment they all been waitin' for, playboy
We here now
We're in the house now, for sure

Girl, I'd trade it all, money, cars and everything
All, even give up my street dream
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl, I'd trade it all

Hot storm, I'm so into you
'Cause even before we hit the bedroom, I was friends with you
If they ask, I ain't gotta say whom in them interviews
My sweet thing, never believe them rumors that been true
In fact, I had no more expense, it's true
But you was wifey could change me into a groom in a mintue, Boo
Maybe my sense of humor gets into you
But girl, they can make a perfume from the scent of you
I wanna take you there, feel like June in December, too
So what you think about Cancun 'til the winter through
I don't know whatever consumes you gonna do
I put a daytime to go to Bloomies and spend with you
Like any other man, I will zoom to the clinic, too
Now I wanna see if me and my junior's identical
I zoom, put a moon on the skin of you
I swear to everything that same afternoon will begin to move, feel me

Girl, I'd trade it all, money, cars and everything
All, even give up my street dream
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl, I'd trade it all

Even give up my good green
All, and I'd give the watch and pinky ring
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl, I'd trade it all

Come here, girl, come and take a walk with me
So I could take you places you don't often be
Come on, ma, come and get lost with me
As far as them other chicks, can't get 'em off-a me
Everlastin' love in a whole other fashion
All I'm askin', let me cash in
'Cause I'll give her passion, all of the Sean John flashin'
In orderly fashion, perhaps when
Figure it out excatly wat Diddy about
'Cause we can take this whole city out
Now who gon' stop us, who gon' knock us
Top us, we can't find coppers to lock us
Leer jets and choppers, love helicopters
Separate the weak from the awesome
Me hard to keep, I gotcha
I rock ya word to big pa-pha I gotcha

Girl, I'd trade it all, money, cars and everything
All, even give up my street dream
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl, I'd trade it all

Even give up my good green
All, and I'd give the watch and pinky ring
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl, I'd trade it all

Now what you want, huh

(I'm gonna give this all up for you, Shorty)

Now what you want, huh
Now what you want, huh, huh, huh

Yeah
Yo, this newcomer's known to move with the seasons
Couple winter lodges, few summer homes
And there for every uw, hum, and moon and make sure when the new hummer roams
The shoes come in chrome
I ain't new if ain't buy white yellow and Q'cumba stones
That send chills threw a womans bones
But life gives groove summer loans
Even though I got the kinda bread that won't matter if a few crumbs are blown
Flights out of few summer loans
Now I wanna wake up every day with you in a new number zone
Ma-Me-ya it's you I'ma phone
Just to erase all the negative view from your dome
And I promise this Fella G
And so case they hit comma of jealousy
And drama you tellin' me
So mama come yell at me
So I could put the top down and we could cruise like Tom and Penelope
My charm is a felony

Girl, I'd trade it all, money, cars and everything
All, even give up my street dream
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl, I'd trade it all

Even give up my good green
All, and I'd give the watch and pinky ring
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl, I'd trade it all

Money, cars and everything
All, even give up my street dream
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl, I'd trade it all

Even give up my good green
All, and I'd give the watch and pinky ring
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl, I'd trade it all

P.Diddy
Fabolous
Diddy
Desert Storm
Rock on, rock on
Bad Boy, yeah
Rock on, rock on
DJ Clue, Duro
Rock on, rock on
I trade it all, baby
That's for life, that you love me
Stop playin', let me holler at you, Boo

Come on, come on
Stop playin', come on, come on
Stop playin', come on, come on
Stop playin', come on, come on
Stop playin', come on, come on
Stop playin', come on, come on
Stop playin', come on, come on
Stop playin', come on, come on
I trade it all
