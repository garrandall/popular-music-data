Someone told me it's all happening at the zoo.
I do believe it, I do believe it's true.
It's a light and tumble journey
From the East side to the park.
Just a fine and fancy ramble to the zoo.
But you can take the cross-town bus
If it's raining or it's cold.
And the animals will love it if you do.

Something tells me it's all happening at the zoo.
I do believe it, I do believe it's true.
The monkeys stand for honesty.
Giraffes are insincere.
And the elephants are kindly but they're dumb.
Orangutans are skeptical of changes in their cages
And the zoo keeper is very fond of rum.
Zebras are reactionaries,
Antelopes are missionaries.
Pigeons plot in secrecy
And hamsters turn on frequently.
What a gas you got to come and see
At the zoo.
