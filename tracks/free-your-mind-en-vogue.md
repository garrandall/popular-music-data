Prejudice, wrote a song about it
Like to hear it? Here it go
Free your mind


I wear tight clothing, high heeled shoes
It doesn't mean that I'm a prostitute, no no
I like rap music, wear hip hop clothes
That doesn't mean that I'm out sellin' dope, no no no
Oh my forgive me for having straight hair, no
It doesn't mean there's another blood in my heir, yeah yeah
I might date another race or color
It doesn't mean I don't like my strong black brothers


Mmm-dah, mmm-dah, mmm-dah, mmm-dah
Why oh why must it be this way?
Mmm-dah, mmm-dah, mmm-dah, mmm-dah
Before you can read me you gotta learn how to see me, I said


Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color blind, don't be so shallow
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color blind, don't be so shallow


So I'm a sista, buy things with cash
That really doesn't mean that all my credit's bad, oh
So why dispute me and waste my time?
Because you really think the price is high for me
I can't look without being watched, and oh
You rang my buy before I made up my mind, OW!
Oh now attitude, why even bother?
I can't change your mind, you can't change my color


Mmm-dah, mmm-dah, mmm-dah, mmm-dah
Why oh why must it be this way?
Mmm-dah, mmm-dah, mmm-dah, mmm-dah
Before you can read me you gotta learn how to see me, I said


Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color blind, don't be so shallow
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color blind, don't be so shallow
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color blind, don't be so shallow
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color blind, don't be so shallow
Free your mind

Mmm-dah, mmm-dah, mmm-dah, mmm-dah
Why oh why must it be this way?
Before you can read me you gotta learn how to see me, I said


Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color blind, don't be so shallow
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color blind, don't be so shallow
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color blind, don't be so shallow
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color blind, don't be so shallow
FREE YOUR MIND!
