There is someone walking behind you
Turn around, look at me
There is someone watching your footsteps
Turn around, look at me

There is someone who really needs you
Here's my heart in my hand
Turn around
(Turn around)
Look at me
(Look at me)
Understand, understand

That there's someone who'll stand beside you
Turn around, look at me
And there's someone to love and guide you
Turn around, look at me

Oh, I've waited, but I'll wait forever
For you to come to me
Look at someone
(Look at someone)
Who really loves you
(Yeah, really loves you)
Turn around, look at me
