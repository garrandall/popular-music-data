Chances are when said and done
Who'll be the lucky ones
Who make it all the way?
Though you say I could be your answer
Nothing lasts forever
No matter how it feels today


Chances are we'll find a new equation
Chances rolled away from me
Chances are all they hope to be


Don't get me wrong I'd never say never
'Cause though love can't change the weather
No act of God can pull me away from you
I'm just a realistic man
A bottle filled with shells and sand
Afraid to love beyond what I can lose
When it comes to you
And though I see us through, yeah


Chances are we'll find two destinations
Chances roll away from me
Still, chances are more than expectations
But possibilities over me


It's a fight with two to one
Lay your money on the sun
Until you crash what have you done?
Is there a better bet than love?
What you are is what you bring
You gotta cry before you sing
Chances, chances
Chances lost are hope's torn out pages
Maybe this time!


Chances are we'll be the combination
Chances come and carry me
Chances are waiting to be taken
And I can see...
Chances are the fascinations
Chances won't escape from me
Chances are only what we make them
And all I need
