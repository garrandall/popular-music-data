I don't have a girl to call my own
And I don't have a lover whose mine alone
Everything I do I always end up feeling blue
Mr. Lonely is my name
(Mr. Lonely)
I don't have a love life that's right or wrong
And I don't hear a love bird sing me it's song
Everything I sing never turns out my way
Mr. Lonely is my name
I want to be like other boys
Go to movies, drive-ins or a date
Every time I meet a girl
I never get a second chance
If I had a girl I'd treat her right
I would make her happy and live for her each time
But to me it seems that all I ever do is dream
Mr. Lonely is my name
(Oooo 's)...
