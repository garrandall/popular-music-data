Doctor, doctor you gotta help me yeah 
You gotta make it right for me 
It seems this other man's name has been following me around 
And it just won't let me be 
You see I got this name and he's got this name too know
Well they're kinda close only a blind crazy fool 
Would think I was him it's like saying green is blue 
But let me tell you brother it started being a bother 
When he made the cover of Time magazine

I was at this party in the wild-hilled hills 
Just the other night 
Her name was Shelly I introduced myself 
She just smiled and said "all right" 
Well we got talkin' and drinkin' wine 
And she said she liked my music thought it was fine 
She said, "Let's make love, your place or mine" 
And in the middle of the passion I was on the borderline 
When she called out a name but it wasn't mine

She called me Bruce, Bruce 
I can hear her calling Bruce, Bruce 
I can hear her calling Bruce, Bruce 
I can hear her 
My name is Rick I'm gonna stick it to ya babe

And there's this kid walking carrying a guitar 
You know I told him that I played 
He asked me my name you know I told him 
I said it plain as clear as day 
Well he seemed really, clearly, sincerely impressed 
And as he pulled a piece paper for me to sign from his vest 
He said, "I thought Born To Run was one of your best" 
Awww wait a minute man, who do you think I am? 
He answered, "Mr. Springsteen, you're a famous man."

He called me Bruce, Bruce 
I can hear him calling Bruce, Bruce 
He called me Bruce, Bruce 
I can hear him 
My name is Richard gonna hit it to you babe

You know my mama called me long distance yesterday 
And as she got off the phone I swear I heard her say

Bye bye Bruce, Bruce 
I can hear her calling Bruce, Bruce 
She called me Bruce, Bruce 
I can hear her 
My name is Ricky gonna stick it to you babe
