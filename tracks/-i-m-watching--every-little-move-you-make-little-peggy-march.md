I'm watching you
Watching you to see
What you're doing without me
Now that you've been gone

I'm watching you
Watching every guy
As you give them all
The eye to dance another song

Yes, I'm watching
Every little move you make
Every little step you take
Every little heart you break

Yes, everything
Every little word you sigh
Is every little time I try
To look the other way
But I keep watching you
I take a little peek
As you see cheek to cheek

Oh, the jealousies
I'm watching you
You know I'm on the floor
So you pour it on some more
Just to torture me.
