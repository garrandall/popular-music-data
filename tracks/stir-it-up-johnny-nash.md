Stir it up, little darling
Stir it up, oh yeah, yeah
Stir it up, little darling

It's been a long, long time
Since I had you on my mind
Now you are here, it's so very clear
Thereâs so much we could do, just me and you, come on

Stir it up, little darling
Stir it up, oh yeah, yeah
Stir it up, little darling

I'll push the wood, light the fire
Oh, I'll satisfy your heart's desire
I will stir it every, every minute
All you have to do, girl, is keep it in it

Stir it up, little darling
Stir it up, oh yeah
Stir it up, little darling

I said I'll push the wood, light the fire
Oh, I'll satisfy your heart's desire
Girl, I'll stir it every, every minute
All you have to do is keep it in it

Stir it up, little darling
Stir it up, little darling
Stir it up, little darling
Stir it up (yeah, yeah) little darling
I said stir it up, little darling
Baby, stir it up, yeah
