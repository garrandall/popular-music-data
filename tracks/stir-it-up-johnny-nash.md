Stir It Up
Bob Marley

Stir it up, little darling, stir it up
Come on baby come on and stir it up little darling, stir it up
It's been a long long time since I've got you on my mind
And now you are here
I say it's so clear
To see what we can do baby, just me and you

Come on and stir it up, little darling, stir it up
Come on baby come on and stir it up. little darling, stir it up
I'll push the wood, I'll blaze your fire
Then I'll satisfy your heart's desire
Said I'll stir it up, yeah, every minute, yeah
All you got to do baby, is keep it in
And stir it up, little darling, stir it up
Come on and stir it up, oh, little darling, stir it up, yeah

Oh, will you quench me when I'm thirsty?
Come and cool me down baby, when I'm hot
Your recipe, darling, is so tasty
And you sure can stir your pot
So stir it up, little darling, stir it up
Come on and stir it up, oh, little darling, stir it up
Come on and stir it up, oh, little darling, stir it up
