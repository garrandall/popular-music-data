When I got the news today
I didn't know what to say
So I just hung up the phone

I took a walk to clear my head
And this is where the walking led
Can't believe you're really gone
Don't feel like going home

So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
And watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer

Funny how the good ones go
Too soon, but the good Lord knows
The reasons why, I guess

Sometimes the greater plan
Is kinda hard to understand
Right now it don't make sense
I can't make it all make sense

So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
And watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer

So long, my friend
Until we meet again
I'll remember you
And all the times that we used to...

...sit right here on the edge of this pier
And watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer
Drink a beer
Drink a beer
Yeah
