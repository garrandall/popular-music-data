Yeah, I feel sanctified
Yeah, I feel sanctified
Yeah, I feel sanctified

I just left my baby's house
And I got the strength I needed
Knowing that the beast of man
Is very hard to please

I'm so glad the sun is shining
To brighten up the day
Cause behind last night
I see things in a different way

Yeah, I feel sanctified
(Feel it, feel it my soul, yeah)
Yeah, I feel sanctified

She led me to the peak of love
And no words could ever describe
Oh, when you get that kind of loving
It's a blessing to be alive

Ooh, the sacred feeling
Just blows through my soul
Searching for sanctuary
To rest it must explode

Yeah, I feel sanctified
Yeah, I feel sanctified
Yeah, I feel sanctified

She led me to the peak of love
And no words could ever describe
Oh, when you get that kind of loving
It's a blessing to be alive

Ooh, the sacred feeling
Just blows through my soul
Searching for sanctuary
To rest it must explode

Yeah, I feel sanctified
Yeah, I feel sanctified
Yeah, I feel sanctified
