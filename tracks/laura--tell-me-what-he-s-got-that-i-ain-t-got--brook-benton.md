Willie and Laura Mae Jones were our neighbors a long time back
They lived right down the road from us in a shack, just like our shack
We worked in the fields together, and we learned to count on each other
When you live off the land you don't have time to think
About another man's
Color.

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine
But that was another place and another time

We'd sit out on the front porch in the evenin' when the sun went down
Willie would play and Laura would sing and the chilluns would dance around
And I'd bring over my guitar, we'd play into the night
And every now and then Willie would grin and say
'Boy you play alright' (and that made me feel so good)

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine
But that was another place and another time

I remember we'd hitch up the mules when Saturday rolled around
We'd always stop by Willie's house and say
'Do y'all need anything from town?'
He'd say 'No, but why don't cha all stop on your way back home
And I'll get Laura Mae to cook us some corn pones (you know, they good)'

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine
But that was another place and another time

The years rolled past our land, and took back what they'd given
We all knew we'd have to move if we was gonna make a livin'
So we all moved off and we went our separate ways
And it sure was hard to say goodbye to Willie and Laura Mae (Jones)

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine
But that was another place and another time

The years rolled past our door and we heard from them no more
Until I saw Willie downtown the other day
I said, "Y'all stop by tonight, and we can sit down and eat a bite
We'd love to see your children and Laura Mae
He shook his head real slow, and spoke with eyes so kind
"This is another place and another time"

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine
But that was another place and another time
