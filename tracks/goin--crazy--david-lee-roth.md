Wow, ah
Yeah

Well, here I'm rolling down another sunny highway
Been in the sun too long
I'm goin' coconuts but least I'm going my way
I'll probably be here when the sun goes down, oh

I wanna live it up, wanna quit my job
Tell the boss to go to hell
I ain't complainin', you do the best with what you got
I know you're laughing 'cause it's easy to tell

I'm goin' crazy
Goin' crazy
Ooh, from the heat

Remember dancing on the pier last night?
Got drunk and fell into the water
The big policeman wasn't laughing, didn't blink an eye
He said, "You're messin' with the mayor's daughter." (Whoa no!)

Don't tell me give it up, too busy getting down
I learned my lessons well
You get it goin' and you don't never stop
I see you smilin' 'cause it's easy to tell

I'm goin' crazy
Goin' crazy
Ooh, from the heat
Yeah

Yeah, yeah, wow
Everybody

Goin' crazy (goin' crazy)
Goin' crazy
From the heat

Ow!
Goin' crazy (goin' crazy)
Goin' crazy
From the heat

Wow-wow-wow-wow
Goin' crazy (goin' crazy)
Goin' crazy
From the heat
