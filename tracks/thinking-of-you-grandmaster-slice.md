"You know on a rainy day like this
I spend a lot of time thinking
Thinking about the goals I set in life
About family and the girl I love
The only thing is that the girl i love
Seems to only exist in my mind
In my dreams
They say that everyone has a perfect match
And if that's true
Sweetheart, I'm thinking of you"
Thinking of someone
With a good sense of humor
That will trust my love
And don't believe rumors
Cuz people like to talk when you have a good thing
Especially if they're single
And don't wear a ring
Cuz you'll have me
And they'll have none
We'll have a table for two
They'll have a table for one
We'll have a lot of laughs
While some sing the blues
Oo i love you and i'm thinking of you
Thinking of you
Dreaming of you and the warmth of your touch
Visions of you
Alone in the dark, oh I need you so much
Thinking of you
Dreaming of you and the warmth of your touch
Visions of you
What can i do when i need you so much
Thinking of a girl that's devoted
And will stand behind me
100% and won't nag or remind me
When my ideas are hopeless
Or i'm on the wrong track
Instead she'll hold me in her arms
Or massage my back
And treat me like a king
Make me feel kinda royal
And when i'm on the road
I know that she'll be loyal
Because we first became friends
Before our love grew
Oo girl, yo i'm thinking of you
Thinking of you
Dreaming of you and the warmth of your touch
Visions of you
Alone in the dark, oh I need you so much
Thinking of you
Dreaming of you and the warmth of your touch
Visions of you
What can i do when i need you so much
I'm thinking of a girl who's intelligent
Who pursues her own goals
And makes love to me at night
WHen it gets kinda cold
And again when we wake up
Oo so beautiful
A girl that looks good without make up
Her beauty's deeper than skin
Beyond the bone marrow
And i'm choosy
So that path to my heart's kinda narrow
And now that you've made it and your love is true
Oo girl yeah im thinking of you
You know dream girl
You might be right in front of my eyes
But I just don't see you
But i want to let you know
That i'm Yours
Sincerely
