Oh yes

Uh, this for you girl
Yo, I took you from the projects, put the best clothes in ya closet
Like Ginger from "Casino" and now you a pro
We was like Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe
All ya jealous girlfriends hatin' waitin'
So I put the cards in yo hand
All I know is Nas was yo man
It was so real, boats and sixes
Special Japanese chefs makin' home cooked dishes
Plenty trips, invisible sets
You know what you missin'
It's funny coz for a while

I Walked around with a smile
But... deep inside, I could hear
Voices telling me "This ain't right"
Don't you know, it's not for you
I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
Cause I love you I just got to stay
You used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh yeah)

Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And I know inside that I'm gonna be alright (Gonna be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright (Gonna be alright)
Friends of mine say to me
Say you got control over me

You're not alone, I played my part
I saw the way you were from the start
Could I expect so much from you
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize I can't change you
You used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it

And I know inside that I'm gonna be alright (Gonna be alright)
I said I didn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright (Gonna be alright)
Said I wouldn't walk away
Some days I want to stay (Days I want to stay)
But leaving you is what I need to do (Need to do)

To be OK (I need to be OK)
I never thought it would be true (Would be true)
Me living without you (Living without you)
Huh, this life is crazy
So now it's time for me to make that move
Huh check it
Yo nobody understands me, I'm dealin' with pressure

My peoples is locked in a jail cell with no bail stressin'
Guess it's the life of a kingpin

Rap Stephen King, rock bling
Like neon lights, we gonna be alright

But it's like you feelin' lesser
Claim I'm actin' like a retard
Right me and my boys
We start fights, well will I mature
You scream I'm in the streets all night
Or where was I at, ya found light brown hairs on my hat
I'm slow caught
You used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And I know inside that I'm gonna be alright (Gonna be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright (Gonna be alright)
