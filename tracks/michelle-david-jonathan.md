Oh, Tell me David, what have you done?
Where has BatSheva's sweetheart gone?
What's taken over? When is enough?
When the going gets lonely â the lonely get rough

Oh, times have changes since you became king,
Since that boy with a flute, that played with a sling
But you still fight from a distance, that sling in your hands
If anyone gets near you don't give them a chance

Oh pray. They have left you here in the cold

Oh, tell me David, with just one stone
You didn't really think Goliath is gone
Now there you go prancing up Jerusalem road
And that giant inside you is starting to get hold

Michelle's in the window, BatSheva's in bed
Jonathan left you, and Uriah's dead
Now I don't pretend to know night time from day
But if I were your god, I'd have something to say

Oh pray. They have left you here in the cold
