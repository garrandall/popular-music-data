The many roads I've covered
The many trails I've burned
But when our paths did cross, love, oh
My whole world made a turn

And we've got time to kill
What a thrill
June and July

We've got all our love
Buckets of
The tears that we cried

Now we don't cry no more
Gonna bolt the door
Don't know what we've got but it feels like a lot
We don't need no more

When my day's work is done
We can take in a jamboree
But I just wanna sit down by the fire
With my love right here beside me

We've got time to kill
Catskill
Sweet by and by

We've got all our love
The sky above
The twinkle in your eye

Now where the wheel might roll
Is where my love and I shall go
We're gonna plant the seed, there ain't nothing we need
We found our own rainbow

My love wants to have her fortune read
And I know that she's in a hurry
If we go along the straight and narrow
You don't even have to worry

We've got time to kill
Standin' still
Go on, give it a try

We've got all our love
Mountains of
The trees are so high

We don't need no big car
Don't eat no caviar
When we come to rest we take to the nest
You know where we are
