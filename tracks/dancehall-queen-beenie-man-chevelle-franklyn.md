It's a dancehall thing!


She's a dancehall queen for life,
Gonna explode like dynamite.
And she's moving outta sight,
Now she a guh mash up di place like dynamite.

She's a dancehall queen for life,
Gonna explode like dynamite.
And she's moving outta sight,
Now she a guh mash up di place like dynamite.


Gal how yuh so full a etiquette and yuh so clever,
Thru a Selassie mek a you design fi be the dancer.
If a fi m alone a woulda tun yuh inna mi lover,
Gal mi waan mi name, mi waan fi knock yuh wid mi hammer.
Den mek mi get back pon track yah,
Marcia! Fus time mi see yuh mi woulda walk inna macka,
Now mi see yuh wine mi waan fi bun up inna fire,
Tan up inna clothes like a tinking Fila,
Fi da gal yah a wine she look like mumma killa.
One touch mi touch mi it bun mi like pepper,
But hear di DJ a utter, mi halla,
Chevelle now or forever yuh halla.


She's a dancehall queen for life,
Gonna explode like dynamite.
And she's moving outta sight,
Now she a guh mash up di place like dynamite.

She's a dancehall queen for life,
Gonna explode like dynamite.
And she's moving outta sight,
Now she a guh mash up di place like dynamite.


Contest a gwaan fi di dancehall queen,
Who a wear di crown nuh di one Alovene Hell,
And powderhouse when miss lady come in,
Den everybaddi staart screem, seen.
Where di girl come from nobody don't know,
She's a devil angel and she's a go-go,
Ask mi I don't know, all mi know,
When mi hitch up dung a African Star,
Mi see bus, mi see truck, mi see bike, mi see car.
Night time come and video ligt it tun on,
Har body staart to alarm, gal because.


Watch mi now,
She can cork any session,
Wid a cute face a create nuff heat inna di place,
An', try nuh touch a button,
If yuh touch a button she a guh try an duh yuh suppen.
An', go girl, faah mi naah stop say so,
Go girl, to the rhythm whey a throw,
Go girl, to the bass whey a blow.
Go girl.

She can cork any session,
Wid a cute face a create nuff heat inna di place,

If yuh touch a button she a guh try an duh yuh suppen.
Go girl, faah mi naah stop say so,
Go girl, to the rhythm whey a throw,
Go girl, to the bass whey a blow.

She can cork any session,
Wid a cute face a create nuff heat inna di place,

If yuh touch a button she a guh try an duh yuh suppen.
You just go girl. Go girl.

Go Girl, to the bass whey a blow.


She's a dancehall queen for life,
Gonna explode like dynamite.
And she's moving outta sight,
Now she a guh mash up di place like dynamite.
