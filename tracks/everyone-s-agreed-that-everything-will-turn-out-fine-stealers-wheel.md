Riding on the subway, watching all the people stare
Everyone just listens, they won't do any talking (oh no, oh no)
They just sit there waitin', waitin' with their eyes
Don't ask any questions, you won't get an answer (oh no, oh no)

Everybody seems to have a good time
Nobody goes stepping out of line
Everyone's agreed that everything will turn out fine

Moving through the city, making all the rounds
Trying different places, didn't like the faces (oh no, oh no)
Rollin' in the gutter, throwin' up my pride
Belly full of whiskey, was it hard to swallow (oh no, oh no)

Everybody seems to have a good time
Nobody goes stepping out of line
Everyone's agreed that everything will turn out fine

Everybody seems to have a good time
Nobody goes stepping out of line
Everyone's agreed that everything will turn out fine

Everyone's agreed that everything will turn out fine
Everyone's agreed that everything will turn out fine
Fine (fine), fine (fine)
So fine (fine) fine (fine)
Fine (fine), fine (fine)
Fine (fine), so fine (fine)

Oh no
