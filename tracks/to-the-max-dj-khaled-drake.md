Get 'em right, get 'em right...
Another one
Get 'em right, get 'em right...
We the Best Music
Get 'em right, get 'em right...
The legacy continues
Get 'em right, get 'em right...
DJ Khaled!


I talk grey, I don't keep it white and black
Only say "I love you" just so I can hear it back
Sometimes, other times I'd love to have you back
Can't think of a night that we ain't turn up to the max
To the max, no
Like the album just went platinum, yeah
Turnt up to the max
If they pop somebody's chain then we gotta get it back
No discussion to be had, we ain't goin' out like that
Man, we lit
(My youngins and we...)
(All of my youngins and we lit...)

Get 'em right, get 'em right...
Yeah

Got it on the dresser, I've been under pressure
They wanna see me laid out on a stretcher
Gotta keep my head up
Get 'em right, get 'em right
Now all of a sudden, people say we cousins
I keep hearin' all this "You my brother" talk, I can't relate to nothin'
My broski down to ride
Made a knot in the line
You can never break ties
We don't really rate those yutes there
That's a whole other side
That's a whole 'nother vibe
They ain't really on shit, yeah

(My youngins and we...)
(All of my youngins and we lit...)


Get 'em right, get 'em right...
More chune pon your head top
Get 'em right, get 'em right...
Watch how you speak on my name, you know?
Get 'em right, get 'em right...
DJ Khaled!
Another one...
