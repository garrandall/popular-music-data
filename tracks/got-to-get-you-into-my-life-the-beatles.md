I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there


Oh, then I suddenly see you
Oh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?


You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again, for I had told you


Oh, you were meant to be near me
Oh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day


Got to get you into my life


What can I do, what can I be?
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true, I'll never leave
And if I do, I know the way there


Oh, then I suddenly see you
Oh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life


Got to get you into my life


Got to get you into my life


I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
And suddenly I see you
Did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?
