I'm so glad I found someone like you to love me
I'm so glad I found you, boy
I'm so glad I found someone like you to love me
I'm so glad I found you, boy

I can't wait to hold you tight
On all those sunny days
Lying on the beach at night
Makin' love in so many ways

I'm so glad I found someone like you to love me
I'm so glad I found you, boy
I'm so glad I found someone like you to love me
I'm so glad I found you, boy

Summertime is party time
It's the time we'll be young and free
And I say what a lucky girl I am
To have you share the Summer with me

I'm so glad I found someone like you to love me
I'm so glad I found you, boy
I'm so glad I found someone like you to love me
I'm so glad I found you, boy

Oh oh hoo
Say you love me so and never let me go
Come on and hold me in your arms, thrill me with your charms
Oh oh baby
Oh oh baby
Oh oh baby, yeah, yeah

Love's so good to me right now
I never ever felt this way
And it's all because of you, my love
Don't ever go, just say you'll stay

I'm so glad I found someone like you to love me
I'm so glad I found you, boy
I'm so glad I found someone like you to love me
I'm so glad I found you, boy (Oh baby, yeah, yeah)

I'm so glad I found someone like you to love me (Oh oh baby)
I'm so glad I found you, boy (Yes, I am now, now, now)
I'm so glad I found someone like you to love me (Oh oh baby)
I'm so glad I found you, boy (Oh oh baby)
