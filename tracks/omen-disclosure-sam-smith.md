I'm feeling something, something different
When you left, my picture changed
I was blinded, I'd not envisioned
The same face in a different frame

It's an omen
Caught my baby crying
Saw the silver lining
It must be an omen
Needed you to show me
Without you I am lonely

My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears as an omen

Omen, omen

You were waiting, I was vacant
You left before my eyes
Then it hit me, you're relocating
And I need you by my side

It's an omen
Caught my baby crying
Saw the silver lining
It must be an omen
Needed you to show me
Without you I am lonely

My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears as an omen

My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears as an omen

Omen
Now love
Omen
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark

Omen
But now I see your tears as an omen
Omen
Now I see your tears as an omen
Omen
