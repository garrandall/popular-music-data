From my heart and from my hand
Why don't people understand
My intentions?

(Weird science)
Plastic tubes and pots and pans
Bits and pieces and
Magic from the hand
We're making

(Weird science)
Things I've never seen before
Behind bolted doors
Talent and imagination

(Weird science)
Not what teacher said to do
Makin' dreams come true
Living tissue; warm flesh

(Weird science)
Plastic tubes and pots and pans
Bits and pieces
Bits and pieces

(Bits of)
My creation, is it real?
It's my creation—I do not know
No hesitation—no heart of gold
Just flesh and blood—I do not know

From my heart and from my hand
Why don't people understand
My intentions, ooh, weird
Weird science!

(Weird science)
Magic and technology
Voodoo dolls and chants
Electricity
We're makin'

(Weird science)
Fantasy and microchips
Shooting from the hip
Something different
We're makin'

(Weird science)
Pictures from a magazine
Diagrams and charts
Mending broken hearts (and makin')

(Weird science)
Something like a recipe
Bits and pieces
Bits and pieces
