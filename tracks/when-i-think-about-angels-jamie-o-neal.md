Why does the color of my coffee match your eyes?
Why do I see you when a stranger passes by?
I swear I hear you in the whisper of the wind
I feel you when the sun is dancin' on my skin
And when it's raining
You won't find me complaining 'cause


When I think about rain
I think about singing
When I think about singing
It's a heavenly tune
When I think about heaven
Then I think about angels
When I think about angels
I think about you


The taste of sugar sure reminds me of your kiss
I like the way that they both linger on my lips
Kisses remind me of a field of butterflies
It must be the way my heart is fluttering inside
Beautiful distraction
You make every thought a chain reaction


When I think about rain
I think about singing
When I think about singing
It's a heavenly tune
When I think about heaven
Then I think about angels
When I think about angels
I think about you

Anywhere I go, anything I do
Everything around me, baby
Makes me think of you


When I think about rain
I think about singing
When I think about singing
It's a heavenly tune
When I think about heaven
Then I think about angels
When I think about angels
I think about you


When I think about rain
I think about singing
When I think about singing
It's a heavenly tune
When I think about heaven
Then I think about angels
When I think about angels
I think about you

Ohhh, oh, oh
When I think about you, baby
Yeah, yeah
I think about you
