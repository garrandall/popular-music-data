Friday afternoon in Bostontown-
still know my way around.
Tryinâ âa find the rehearsal spot for
the reunion of the âkids on the block.

Gonna rip it like we used to do.
Good to be back chillinâ with the crew.
Donât know how its gonna be, but
last time we made history.

So tell ya mother and ya sistah too,
the New Kids are coming back for you.
And in my heart I knew youâd never forget,
but to see you again like this
makes me feel like Iâll never be alone.

Wherever it is Iâm goinâ to, whatever I am
is because of you and I thank you. And I thank you.
5 BROTHERS AND A MILLION SISTERS-
didnât know how much I missed you.
Thank you. And I thank you.

All the way back and all the way up tonight.
Call it what you want, but Iâll call it love tonight.
Some people said we couldnât do it again,
but the New Kids had the last word in the end.

See what happens when you follow your dreams?
See what happens when you just believe?
The whole world opens up her arms.
Everything is easy that used to be hard.

So tell ya mother that I lover her too
and donât you know we did it all for you, cuz
in my heart I knew youâd never forget,
but to see you again like this
makes me feel like Iâll never be alone.

Wherever it is Iâm goinâ to, whatever I am
is because of you and I thank you. And I thank you.
5 BROTHERS AND A MILLION SISTERS-
didnât know how much I missed you.
Thank you. And I thank you.

Cuz you build me up. You make me high.
When I feel your love, I wanna fly.
No matter what weâre goinâ through
there ainât nothinâ we canât do.

And I thank you.
