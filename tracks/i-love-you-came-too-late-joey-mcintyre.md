Baby listen to me
If I had the chance
I'd say the words
Come on...

The bluest of blue that's what her eyes are
That's what I am today
And if I had it all to do all over again
I wouldn't have waited so long to say

I can't live without you
Don't want nobody else
Baby, listen very closely
I love you...

Chorus:
I couldn't lie, she couldn't wait
I love you came too late
I'd give my life for yesterday
I love you came too late

I should've seen the signs, paid her more attention
But I pushed her love away (I pushed her love away)
So she found someone to give her what she needed
Somebody else not afraid to say (not afraid to say)

I can't live without you
Don't want nobody else
Baby listen very closely
I love you...

(repeat chorus)
I can't live without you
Don't want nobody else
My heart is in my hand
I took a good look at myself
If I had another chance I'd shout it out to the world
I LOVE YOU!

(repeat chorus and fade)
