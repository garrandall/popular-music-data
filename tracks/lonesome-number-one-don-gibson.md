Lonesome number one just call me lonesome number one
Although no titles have I won I surely must be lonesome number one

Every love I've had has faded like a dew
Every one I wanted has wanted someone new
Heartaches hang around they always come
I surely must be lonesome number one
Lonesome number one...

Every love I've had...
Yes I surely must be lonesome number one
