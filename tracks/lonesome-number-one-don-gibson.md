Lonesome Number One, just call me Lonesome Number One 
Although no titles have I won, I surely must be Lonesome Number One 

Every love I've had has faded like the dew 
Every one I've wanted, has wanted someone new 
Heartaches hang around and always come 
I surely must be Lonesome Number One 

Lonesome Number One, just call me Lonesome Number One 
Although no titles have I won, I surely must be Lonesome Number One 

It seems I'm always losing, love just can't come near 
Just when love gets close it always disappears 
Sorrow always keeps me on the run 
I surely must be Lonesome Number One 

Lonesome Number One, just call me Lonesome Number One 
Although no titles have I won, I surely must be Lonesome Number One 
Just call me Lonesome Number One, here I come I'm Lonesome Number One
