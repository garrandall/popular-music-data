(Ooooo, Ooooo)
I'm gonna tell you something you don't wanna hear
You never listen when I talk
Maybe you'll listen when I walk
So I made my mind up and made a sandwich
And I didn't shed a tear
I gave you one last minute of my time
In this mess I left behind
When you come home tonight
And turn on the light
Don't you be surprised to find


My little good-byes
Empty hangers by the closet door
Lipstick tube on the bathroom floor
My little good-byes
Unpaid bills by the kitchen phone 
I took the Beatles, left Billy Joel
Little good-byes, little good-byes

I'm sure, you're sure I'll be back in just an hour or two
You'll tape a Hallmark to my door
They always said it better than you
And if you're wondering
When you're gonna hear from me
Well, take a real good look around boy
And it won't hard to see
When you come home tonight and turn on the light
Don't you be surprised to find


My little good-byes
Took your favorite Dodger's hat
Left the litter, but I took the cat
My little good-byes
Loaded up the TV in the back of my car
Have fun watching the VCR
Little good-byes, oh baby, little good-byes


So, cry to your mama
And your sympathetic friends and tell'em 
And tell them how the story ends


My little good-byes
Took the hourglass, left the sand
Now you got time on your hands
My little good-byes
Took the statue from Japan
Funny little Buddha man


My little good-byes
Change my voice on the machine
Or there'll be little good-byes with every ring
My little good-byes
Left the pictures and took the frame
I've got the umbrella, here comes the rain
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Little good-byes
Rain - yeah, yeah, yeah
Little good-byes
Hey, hey - yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, hey - yeah, yeah, yeah
Little good-byes
