He's the 1432 Franklin Pike Circle hero
And you can see him every weekend
With a car full of kids and snow cones

And the people cross town don't know his name
But on Franklin Pike Circle, he's king
1432 Franklin Pike Circle hero

Well, at five thirty-five at
The corner of Franklin and Warner
A blue station wagon comes
Sliding around the corner

And on down Franklin Pike Circle
All you're seeing is a streak of blue
And pulls in the drive at the address of 1432

And he says, my head aches and my back hurts
And I don't feel like talking
Don't wan go the show to see Doctor Zhivago
Don't wanna take the dog out walking

I wanna sit right here in this easy chair
It's been a jungle all day, you know
The 1432 Franklin Pike Circle hero is home

He was out pitching ball with the
Kids in the neighborhood yesterday
And the old major leaguer had to quit
'Cause he said he threw his arm away

And the kids all hid behind the hedge
And laughed at him but wouldn't let it show
Because they love him so,
He's the 1432 Franklin Pike Circle hero

He's the 1432 Franklin Pike Circle hero
And you can see him every weekend
With a car full of kids and snow cones

And, you know people cross town
Don't know his name
But on Franklin Pike Circle, he's king
1432 Franklin Pike Circle hero

Well, he won a little pony at the
Hill High auction just the other day
And he didn't mean to do it
And he wanted to give the pony away

AWhen they called out his name
He tried not to claim it
But the kids started crying
'Cause they'd already named it

And who's up every Saturday morning
Saddling his new toy, you guessed it
The 1432 Franklin Pike Circle cowboy

He's the 1432 Franklin Pike Circle hero
And you can see him every weekend
With a car full of kids and snow cones

During Christmas, took the kids
Down to see the floats
When he wanted to stay home
And watch the Baltimore Colts
1432 Franklin Pike Circle Hero

Well, the ten-thirty news usually
Finds our hero is a sleepy head
And Peter's out somewhere wrecking the car
And the rest of the kids have gone to bed

So she takes his hand
They climb the stairs and he falls asleep
And she bends over him so tenderly
To kiss his cheek

'Cause she loves him so
And she's lucky, you know
To be married to the 1432
1432 Franklin Pike Circle hero

He's the 1432 Franklin Pike Circle hero
And you can see him every weekend
With a car full of kids and snow cones

Christmas time, he took
'Em down to see the floats
When he wanted to stay home
And watch the Baltimore Colts
He's the 1432 Franklin Pike Circle hero
