You're always in a great big hurry, grab a kiss and off you scurry
Off to there, and there to who knows where
I'd give the world and all creation for a little conversation
Just a word or two, how are things, what's new?
Please talk to me, talk to me, talk to me
Your magical kiss can take me just so far
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me
Don't leave me like this, dangling from a star
You set me all aflame and it's so pleasin'
It would be a shame if you were only teasin'
So, my love, before I go, turn the light way down low
And talk to me, talk to me, talk to me
