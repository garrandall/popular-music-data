Count me out
Count me out

Fellas want to hang
And save tonight just
For the gang
But you'll have to count me
Out tonight
If I can't bring my girl

Don't look surprised
When I tell you that
Gotta spend some time
With my baby, yes
So if that means
We're gonna rain on
Your parade

You'll have to count me out
You're gonna have to count me
Out
You'll have to count me out
I wanna be with my girlfriend
You'll have to count me out
This time
You'll have to count me out

When she asked me please
Could I say no and feel at
Ease
If you count me out tonight
She's gonna be with me wherever
I go

She's got a sweet personality
She saves her kisses just for me
So if that means we're gonna rain on
Your parade

You'll have to count me out
You're gonna have to count
Me out
You'll have to count me out
I'm saving kisses for my baby
You'll have to count me out
This time
You'll have to count me out

You'll have to count me out
You're gonna have to count
Me out
You'll have to count me out
My baby wants to be with me
You'll have to count me out
That's the way it's gonna be
You'll have to count me out

Count me out
Count me out

You'll have to count me out
You're gonna have to count me
Out
You'll have to count me out
I wanna be with my girlfriend
You'll have to count me out
This time
You'll have to count me out
This time
You'll have to count me out

You'll have to count me out
You're gonna have to count
Me out
You'll have to count me out
I'm saving all my loving for her
You'll have to count me out
This time
You'll have to count me out

I love my baby but she's just a
Tease
And when I need her I say please,
Please, please
Can I hold you,
Squeeze you,
Cause I need you
Count me out
You'll have to count me out
This time
Don't count me out
Don't leave me out
You'll have to count me out
This time

You'll have to count me out
Count me out
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
Count me out
You'll have to count me out

Man, we're going to the movies
Then to the park, to play a little
Ball till it get dark
That's what being young is all about
Man, C-O-U-N-T me out

Well what about us,
We're your friends
We wanna C-O-U-N-T
Me in,
No not tonight
Where you going then
Tonight I wanna be with my girlfriend

You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
This time
You'll have to count me out

Count me out
Count me out
Count me out

Don't count me out
Don't leave me out

You'll have to count me out
You're gonna have to count
Me out
You'll have to count me out
I'm saving kisses for my baby
You'll have to count me out
This time
You'll have to count me out

You'll have to count me out
You're gonna have to count
Me out
You'll have to count me out
I wanna be with my girlfriend
You'll have to count me out
This time
You'll have to count me out
