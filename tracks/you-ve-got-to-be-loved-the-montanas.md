You gotta be loved
You gotta be loved
You gotta remember, girl
To make your life worthwhile
You gotta be wanted
You gotta be loved
You gotta be loved, yeah
You gotta be loved
You're hidden in clothes you wore
That soon went out of style
'Cause, baby, you need it
You gotta be loved
You gotta be loved, yeah
You gotta be loved
You gotta be loved, yeah
You gotta be loved all the way
Every hour, every day
I'll be there, I'll be with you
You gotta be loved, yeah
You gotta be loved all the time
All the dreams that were mine
We can share
You know, baby, how I care
Turn around and I'll be there
You needn't be lonely when
There's someone all the while
To make you feel wanted
You gotta be loved
You gotta be loved
You gotta be loved
You gotta be wanted
You gotta be loved
You gotta be loved, yeah
You gotta be loved
You gotta be loved, yeah
You gotta be loved all the way
Every hour, every day
I'll be there, I'll be with you
You gotta be loved, yeah
You gotta be loved all the time
All the dreams that were mine
We can share
You know, baby, how I care
Turn around and I'll be there
You needn't be lonely when
There's someone all the while
To make you feel wanted
Yes, you gotta be loved
You gotta be loved
You gotta be loved
You gotta be loved
