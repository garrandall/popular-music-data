Everyday is getting worse
Do the same things, and it hurts
I don't know if I should cry
All I know is that I'm tryin'
I wanna believe in you
I wanna believe in you, but you make it so hard to do
What's the point of makin' plans?
You break all the ones we had
I don't know where we went wrong
'Cause we used to be so strong
I wanna believe in you
I wanna believe in you


So, why can't you be, be good to me?


I don't ask for much
All I want is love
Someone to see
That's all I need
Somebody to be
Somebody to be good to me, good to me
Gotta be good to me, good to me, please


I used to think I had it all
Then one day, we hit a wall
I had hoped you were the one
Where's my dream?
Where has it gone?
I wanted to be with you
Forever, just me and you


So, why can't you be, be good to me?


I don't ask for much
All I want is love
Someone to see
That's all I need
Somebody to be
Somebody to be good to me, good to me
Gotta be good to me, good to me, please


What up, what up mommy?
What it is?
What's good?
I make you shine, like a star up in Hollywood
I'll be your knight in shining armour
Your prince in the saga
Never catching me bringin' drama, never that
Whoa, you run the club, like monopoly
Smiling, looking like you won a mil of the lottery
And I'ma be good, like water to a whale
Jassy world, Miss Ashley Tisdale


Where do I go from here?
You've gotten under my skin
And I don't know how to get out of this place that I'm in


I don't ask for much
All I want is love
Someone to see
That's all I need
Somebody to be
Somebody to be good to me, good to me
Gotta be good to me, good to me, please
I don't ask for much
All I want is love
Someone to see
That's all I need
Somebody to be
Somebody to be good to me, good to me
Gotta be good to me, good to me, please
