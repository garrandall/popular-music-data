I said D-A-W-I-N
(Silent√≥)


They can imitate you
The way your body's movin'
You got something special
About to make me lose it
I like the way you move, girl
I like the way you move, girl


They can imitate you
But they can't duplicate you
Cause you got something special
That makes me wanna taste you
I want it all day long
I'm addicted like it's wrong
I want it all day long
I'm addicted like it's wrong


Whatcha gon
Whatcha gon do with that dessert
(Instrumental)
Murder that, murder that
Dancefloor, dancefloor
(Instrumental)
Murder that
Murder that
Murder that


Oh! The way your body movin' got me hesitating
I'm lookin' at you girl, yeah, you so amazing
Kinda complicated, got me educated (what?)
When I watch you I feel the rhythm in my heart
When I see you girl, I knew it from the start
Movin' to the beat, I'm just tryin' to play my part
I'm addicted, I just can't miss this chance
To go ahead and get my dance


They can imitate you
But they can't duplicate you
Cause you got something special
That makes me wanna taste you
I want it all day long
I'm addicted like it's wrong
I want it all day long
I'm addicted like it's wrong


They can imitate you
But they can't duplicate you
Cause you got something special
That makes me wanna taste you
I want it all day long
I'm addicted like it's wrong
I want it all day long
I'm addicted like it's wrong


Whatcha gon', whatcha gon' do with that dessert?
Murder that, murder that dance floor, dance floor
Murder that
Murder that
Murder that
Whatcha gon', whatcha gon' do with that dessert?
Murder that
Murder that
Murder that
Murder that, murder that


Are you saving that dessert for me?
Cause if you are baby
You know you could work for me
The way you do it causing jealousy
But you don't ever gotta worry about the enemy
They try to do it like you
And they get mad cause they don't do it successfully
They try to copy your moves
But they don't never ever do it that tastefully


Whatcha gon
Whatcha gon do with that dessert
(Instrumental)
Murder that, murder that
Dancefloor dancefloor
(Instrumental)
Whatcha gon
Whatcha gon do with that dessert
(Instrumental)
Murder that
Murder that
Murder that


Are you saving that dessert for me?
Cause if you are baby
You know you could work for me
The way you do it causing jealousy
But you don't ever gotta worry about the enemy
They try to do it like you
And they get mad cause they don't do it successfully
They try to copy your moves
But they don't never ever do it that tastefully


They can imitate you
But they can't duplicate you
Cause you got something special
That makes me wanna taste you
I want it all day long
All day long
All day long
I want it all day long
All day long
Whatcha gon
Whatcha gon do with that dessert
