If I could hold you in the arms of love tonight
I'd never let you go
As the hours go by I'd show you why we've waited for this
As two lovers whisper low

If I could feel that magic kiss your lips invite
Imagine the joys I'd know
The day has died away, let's find a hideaway
And share the promise of a new tomorrow
In the arms of love tonight

The day has died away, let's find a hideaway
And share the promise of a new tomorrow
In the arms of love tonight

Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
