Well, I told you
To hit the road, Jack
I'm sorry now, so
Won't you come on back

Why you go and
Break my heart now
You know that we
Should never, never part

Well, come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on now

Well, I told you
That you had to go
When I found out
You ain't had no dough

Whoa, money ain't everything
My love means more than anything

Well, come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on now

Now I'm back down on my knees
Say you want me back

Yeah, you come on, daddy
Cause I need a Cadillac

Well now, you told me
To pack my bags, baby
And that I had to go now

Well, that was yesterday
Well, I ain't coming back
No more, no, no, no

Well, I told you
To hit the road, Jack
I'm sorry now, so
Won't you come on back

Well now, you told me
To pack my bags
I had to go out on my own

Well, come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on now

Well, I told you
To hit the road, Jack
I'm sorry now, so
Won't you come on back

Well now, you told me
To pack my bags and go
Oh, I don't know now

Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on back

Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on back
