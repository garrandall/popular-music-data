I woke up again this morning
And wouldn't you know it... pouring rain
I went and burned a pot of coffee
And like us I poured it down the drain

'Cause I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my my bad, come back song

I know I said I wouldn't miss you
But now I'm saying I'm a fool
You're on the feel good side of leaving
And I'm the backside of a mule

And I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my so sad come back song

And now I'm laying down without you
In this king size empty bed
And I wish I had my arms around you
But I'll just dream of you instead

'Cause I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my get packed, come back

Hey, I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go and letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my my bad, come back song

Oh yeah yeah

I know I said I wouldn't miss you
I said I wouldn't miss you girl, yeah

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

We all sang na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na, yeah

Come on now

This is my my bad, come back song
