I wrote a simple song
With simple words and harmony
Wasn't very long
Before a star, I was bound to be

I didn't care if it made the charts
I only wrote it for you and me
They think they're so smart now
They're not as smart as they want to be

They took my simple song, yes they did
They changed the words and the melody
Made it all sound wrong, yeah
Now it sounds like a symphony

Who told them to mess with my
Oh now, who gave them the right, I wanna know now
That song was personal
Because I wrote it for you
It's yours and mine, girl

Mmm, girl
Oh Lord

I don't care if it makes the charts, y'all no
I only wrote it for you and me
They think they're so smart, yes they do
They're not as smart as they want to be

Who told them to mess with my, oh now
Who gave them the right, I wanna know
That song was personal, whoa
I wrote it for you
It's yours and mine

Yeah, yeah...
