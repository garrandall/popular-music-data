It's done in Alabama
(You shall be free)
Way down in Louisianna
(You shall be free)
It's down in Alabama
(You shall be free)
Now, now, now nobody's gonna set 'em down

Lord have mercy on my soul
How many chickens have I stole?
One last night and night before
I'm goin' back and try and get 10 or 'leven more

Started gettin' more
(You shall be free)
I love my chicken baby
(You shall be free)
But down in Alabama
(You shall be free)
Now, now, now nobody's gonna set 'em down

Nine feet, ten feet
Going across a hill
Nine feet stepped on
Ten feet hill
Nine feet turn around
But ten feet cleared

His teeth fell out
But his tongue stayed in
(You shall be free)
Six, seven, eight now
(You shall be free)
Way down in Alababa
(You shall be free)
Now, now, now nobody's gonna set 'em down

Leo the monkey
Told the lion one day
A bad little fella's comin' your way
He talked about your family
It's a crying shame
Your mama's workin' on the chain gang
She's bustin' bricks now
(You shall be free)
She's workin' hard, baby
(You shall be free)
But down in Alabama
(You shall be free)
Now, now, now nobody's gonna set 'em down

The preacher and the digger
Were friends one day
Along came a bear
Comin' down the way
A preacher told the digger
He said, lord our prayer won't kill this bear
We got to make it baby
(You shall be free)
We got to run for it
(You shall be free)
But down in Alababa
(You shall be free)
Now, now, now nobody's gonna set 'em down

Way down in Alababa
(You shall be free)
Way down in Louisianna
(You shall be free)
Now, now, now nobody's gonna set 'em down
