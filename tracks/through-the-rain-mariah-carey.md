When you get caught
In the pouring rain
With nowhere to run
Without anyone and you
Get a little bit frightened
Cause you've lost your way home
But through all the thunder and lightening
Just keep praying and keep
Saying to yourself

Yes I can, yes I can
I'll make it through the rain
I'll stand up once again
On my own and I know
That I'm strong and in time
I can mend
When I'm afraid
I hold tighter to my faith
Live another day longer
And I make it through the rain

And if you keep on falling down
Don't you dare give in
You will arise safe and sound
If you keep pressing on, steadfastly
You'll have everything you need
Believe you will prevail
If you just say

Yes I can, yes I can
I'll make it through the rain
I'll stand up once again
On my own and I know
That i'm strong and in time
I can mend
When I'm afraid
I hold tighter to my faith
Live another day longer
And I make it through the rain

There are times in your life
When you feel like you can't
Keep going
But keep holding on, keep holding on
There are times in your life when you
Feel like the world all around you
Has shattered, but know that you can't be broken
Don't be afraid, stand tall and say

Yes I can, yes I can
I'll make it through the rain
I'll stand up once again
On my own and I know
That I'm strong and in time
I can mend
When I'm afraid
I hold tighter to my faith
Live another day longer
And I make it through the rain
