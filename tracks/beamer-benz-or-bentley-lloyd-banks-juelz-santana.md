Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
My jeans are never empty
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
This scheming don't affect me


Im fresh Im fly, Im so damn high
more than 500 horses when I roll by
Im calm Im cool, everything brand new
I don't hand cuff you can get your whole damn crew

Get in my Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
beat it I bet she let me
she been fiending since she met me
Im the coolest shit especially when I throw on all my Gretzky
got my sm-sm-smith and Wessie to protect me so respect me
this is heavy new Bentley
color vanilla and cherry Andretti-O Pirelli make a movie out the getty
where my ring and my confetti Im Kobe Bryant ready
pink Rose and chronic smelly while stumbling out the telly
Im so fly Im so ferry and the way I flow is very
ginsu or machete, way my pencil move his deadly
platinum band platinum bezzie
make a straight girl out of lezzie
magazine mac benzie keep my windows like the prezzie
press a button than Im stuntin
my roof look like its duckin
meter go 2 hundred something
and my trunk do when its bumpin
I am not the one for jumpin I will rachet out and stump him
dump him, your better off dead, ya money red


Im fresh Im fly, Im always high
got ya bitch waving at me when I roll by

Im calm Im cool everything brand new
I don't handcuff you can get the whole damn crew




Whether Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
I be movin I be movin
making movies Tom Cruisin
If its action than Im shootin
pockets fat, necks studded
boy my nick name should be Ruben
my Columbian connect told me the Mexicans have moved it
and he know just how I get it so we bout to introduce him
got a girl named cigar called her that because she Cuban
got a black chick that be boosting
got a white girl that be boothin
gotta watch her cause she use it
but she fuck me like she stupid
and she always ready to give me that becky
last time it was so good I almost crashed my Bentley
hit the club ordered bottles see the sparks in the sky
will have this whole bitch lookin like the 4th of July
but if you get to frontin and the pushing lead to shoving
we just bussin and we leaving like its nothin
if it aint the Gucci or the Louie than its Polo or its Rugby
and this bitch I brought with me she be baggin bitches for me

I got a girl named Kima
and Kima like Christina
baby three don't make a crowd it make a sex scene meaner
I just wanna get between her
turn it over scream her
than its one, two, Im through, see ya
I scoop her in my Beamer, Benz or Bentley.
