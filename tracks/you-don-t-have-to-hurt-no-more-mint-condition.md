I don't like the way he treats you
That's not the way
That I would do you
What gives him the right to say
Its you that he owns

All those nights he left you to cry
Left you with nothing
But tears in your eyes
Girl, just come with me
'Cause this house is not a home

Girl he's over and gone
You don't have to hurt no more
And I'll be there for you
To give all the love you're yearning for

And you don't have to hurt no more
Baby, he's over
I'll be what you're looking for
Let me take over
And you don't have to hurt no more

I'll make you see
I'll be what you're looking for
And more
So you don't have to hurt
You don't have to hurt

No more
How could he look into those pretty eyes
And hurt you?
Oh, no
You don't have to hurt no more

Every day I see you
With those sad eyes
You try so hard to hold back
From all you cries

Just come with me
There is no reason
For your broken heart to stand

Girl, your heart will heal
From all the pain you feel
Just let me show you
The real love you've been waiting for

Just close the door
You cannot take no more
There is no reason for

Girl, he's over and gone
You don't have to hurt no more
And I'll be there for you
To give all the love you're yearning for

You don't have to hurt no more
Baby, he's over
I'll be what you're looking for
Let me take over
You don't have to hurt no more

I'll make you see
I'll be what you're looking for
And more
So you don't have to hurt

You don't have to hurt no more
Baby, he's over
I'll be what you're looking for
Let me take over
You don't have to hurt no more

I'll make you see
I'll be what you're looking for and more
So you don't have to hurt
You don't have to hurt no more

He must be a fool
To leave you alone
You don't have to hurt
