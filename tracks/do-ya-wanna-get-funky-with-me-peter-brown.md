DO YA WANNA GET FUNKY WITH ME
PETER BROWN

The lady smiled at me when she asked about the possibility
That we might spend some time alone
And oh the thoughts that filled my head
When she looked in my eyes and slowly said
Do ya wanna get funky with me, do ya wanna... oh!

The idle mind is a playground for the devil
Do ya wanna get funky with me, do ya wanna?
Do ya wanna get funky

The way she spoke to me told me I had the opportunity
To see how funky she could be
And when I looked into her eyes
The fire they held made me realize
Her flame was burning just for me

The lady tempted me
I closed my eyes, it was plain to see
She was the devil in disguise
And oh the message she'd relay
When she would take my hand and say
Do ya wanna get funky with me, do ya wanna?

The idle mind is a playground for the devil
Do ya wanna get funky with me, do ya wanna?

I wanna set ya on fire
"Cause it's hot
"Cause it's hot

It's so hot I'm burning up
It's so hot I'm burning up
Oh no no no

I felt the heat within, the lust of love and the urge to sin
I felt her reachin' for my soul
And then I knew I had no choice
But to heed the command of the devil's voice
Do ya wanna get funky with me, do ya wanna, do ya wanna, do ya wanna?

The idle mind is a playground for the devil
Do ya wanna get funky with me, do ya wanna get funky
Do ya wanna get funky with me, do ya wanna?

The idle mind is a playground for the devil
Ah, do ya wanna get funky with me, do ya wanna?
Do ya wanna get funky with me?
