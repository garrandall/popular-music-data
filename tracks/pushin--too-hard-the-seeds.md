You're pushin' too hard, uh-pushin' on me
You're pushin' too hard, uh-what you want me to be
You're pushin' too hard about the things you say
You're pushin' too hard every night and day
You're pushin' too hard
Pushin' too hard on me (too hard)

Well all I want is to just be free
Live my life the way I wanna be
All I want is to just have fun
Live my life like it's just begun
But you're pushin' too hard
Pushin' too hard on me (too hard)

Well, better listen girl to what I'm tellin' you
You better listen girl, or we are through
You better stop all your foolin' around
Stop your runnin' all over town
'Cause you're pushin' too hard
Pushin' too hard on me (too hard)

Well I know there's a lotta fish in the sea
I know some would-uh stay by me
So if you don't think I'm gonna try
You better ask yourself the reason why
'Cause you're pushin' too hard
Pushin' too hard on me (too hard)

Pushin' too hard, pushin' too hard
Pushin' too hard, pushin' too hard
Pushin' too hard, pushin' too hard
Pushin' too hard on me (too hard)
