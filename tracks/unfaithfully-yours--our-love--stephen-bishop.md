I knew I needed moral support
Somebody who could last
I've had my share of love as a sport
Waiting in line too long to save the best

I'm a jealous guy
I'm insecure
But I've got what
I've been looking for

One love, just one love
Makes me happy, so happy
One love, just one love
Makes me happy, so happy

One day your world is falling apart
Wondering where the stars are
Then love hits you and, boom
There goes your heart

Now it's boy gets girl
And the dream comes true
My heart is racing
It's really true

One love, just one love
Makes me happy, so happy
One love, just one love
Makes me happy, oh, so happy

Oh, oh

I've been waiting so long
To make her mine
There is no reason for us
To draw the line

Cause I love this girl
I know for sure
Yes, I've got what
I've been looking for

One love, just one love
Makes me happy, so happy
One love, just one love
Makes me happy, oh, so happy

One love, just one love
Makes me happy, so happy
One love, just one love
I've got one love
I've got one love

One love, just one love
Makes me happy, so happy...
