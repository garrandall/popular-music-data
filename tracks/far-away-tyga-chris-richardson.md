Walk a thousand miles
Just to see her (see her)
But sheâs far far away
And Iâd do anything just to see her face
But sheâs far far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again


Sittinâ on a plane
Reminiscing back when I made that mistake
I wish it never ended with a heartbreak
Now your heart broken, tears in ya face
Ask myself why, looking at the sky
If I could turn back Iâd make it all right
Praying that you better but its still stormy weather
Donât wanna let go but the rain wont let up
Now you gone, still thinking bout you everyday
And I know feelings was hurt and you can blame me but
Iâm sorry for the games that I played
But now itâs too late
And now sheâsâ¦


Now sheâs far far away
And Iâd do anything just to see her face
But sheâs far far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again


Itâs cold putting up a fight
Arguing back and forth through the night
Regardless what I said and I donât mean most of it
You know I really love you, this the realest goinâ get
It take time to realise what you really wanna know
You was ready for it all but your feelings I ignored
I know my fault, I shouldâve gave more
Now youâre miles away and Iâm miles on tour
Now itâs drums playing, crowd singing
Light changing, wish you was here to witness all that
It starts fading
They say two wrongs donât make it right
And I was wrong and now it ain't right


Cause sheâs far far away
And Iâd do anything just to see her face
But sheâs far far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again


Na na na nah
If I could turn back
If I could make it right
Iâd do just that
If I could make it right
Iâd do it all tonight
Hold you in my arms, with you Iâd spend my life

Na na na nah
If I could turn back
If I could make it right
Iâd do just that
Iâd do just that
If I could turn back

(Come back here again)


Cause sheâs far far away
And Iâd do anything just to see her face
But sheâs far far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again
