Hello baby yeah this is the Big Bopper speaking ha ha you sweet thing
Do I what will I what oh baby you know what I like
Chaintily lace and a pretty face and a pony tail hangin' down
A wiggle and a walk and a giggle and a talk made the world go round
There ain't nothing in the world
Like a big eyed girl to make me act so funny make me spend my money
Make me fool real loose like a long necked goose
Like a girl oh baby that's what I like
What's that honey pick you up at eight and don't be late
But baby I ain't got no money honey ha ha oh alright honey you know what I like

(Hello you good lookin' thing you yeah huh now this is the Killer speaking
Do I like what I sure do like it baby)
Chantilly lace pretty face pony tail hangin' down
A wiggle in her walk giggle in her talk it gonna make that world go around
Ain't nothing in the world like a big- eyed girl
Make me act so funny spend my doggone money
I feel real loose like a long neck goose like a whoa baby that's what I like
(Hello) huh (hello) can I what (hello) do I what (hello) will I what (hello)
Can't never tell baby ha ha ha ha I might But honey you knows what I like
Chantilly lace (chantilly lace) pretty face (chantilly lace) 
Pony tail hanging down (chantilly lace)
A wiggle in her walk (chantilly lace) giggle in her talk (chantilly lace) 
It gonna make that world go around (chantilly lace)
Ain't nothin' in the world like a big eyed girl
Make me act so funny spend my doggone money

Huh ha ha ha ha huh what you say pick you up at eight
And don't be late you gotta be joking woman

Chantilly lace (chantilly lace)  pretty face (chantilly lace) 
Pony tail hanging down (chantilly lace)
A wiggle in her walk (chantilly lace) giggle in her talk (chantilly lace) 
Oh it makes the world go around (chantilly lace)

Make me act so funny spend my doggone money

Ooh ha ha ha ha honey you tearin' me up on this telephone
I swear I don't know what in the world I'm gonna do with you
You yap and yap and yap and yap and yap
But when you break it all down you know what I like
Chantilly lace (chantilly lace) pretty face (chantilly lace) 
Pony tail hanging down (chantilly lace)
A wiggle in her walk (chantilly lace) giggle in her talk (chantilly lace) 
It gonna make that world go around (chantilly lace)
Ain't nothing in the world like a big eyed girl
Make me act so funny spend my doggone money
I feel real loose like a long neck goose like a whoa baby that's what I like
