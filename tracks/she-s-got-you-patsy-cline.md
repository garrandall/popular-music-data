Jumping in the Harley she rides alone
81 sticker blacked out, no chrome
Mean grip ape hanger ready to roll
Born to be a gypsy, long way from home
Shuffle through the iPod 
With a little bit of 'shine and some DAC
Quick to pull a pistol, if you know what I mean
She's a dive bar beauty queen
She grew up in the hills driving daddy's old truck
Have that blue nose pit since he was a pup
Flip that Zippo, girl, light one up
Back behind the shed where you grew up
Uncle Ronnie wore hats that were red and white
Didn't say too much but he taught her to fight
She loved to live wrong more than she did right
Devil with the halo, gypsy in the night
I love the way her cigarette hangs down low
I love it when she dances to rock and roll
I'm loving them hips in them ripped up jeans
Just a rock and roll dive bar beauty queen

Dive bar beauty queen
Living off whiskey and nicotine
Prettiest thing you've ever seen in the dark
She likes Motorhead and Patsy Cline
Smokes the kind and packs a nine
And she's got barbed wire wrapped around her heart

When she slides in through the backdoor of a dive bar late at night
There's thunder pumping in my heart from the lightning in her stride
And her smooth silky silhouette is shining through her cigarette smoke
And there's cause for concern when the boys act like a fool
Cause the venom from her kiss knocks their asses off their stool
Then she'll drink their shots of whiskey, then play some Dixie
And then she'll ride

Dive bar beauty queen
Living off whiskey and nicotine
Prettiest thing you've ever seen in the dark
She likes Motorhead and Patsy Cline
Smokes the kind and packs a nine
And she's got barbed wire wrapped around her heart

Shes a honky-tonking blue collar angel
Dive bar beauty don't fit any labels
Whiskey woman ain't scared of the devil
Legend in her own living life as a rebel

Long blonde hair standing five foot nine
Bright green eyes, switch blade on her thigh
Says she's a rebel and she loves to shine
At the hole in the wall going overdrive
She grew up fast and she grew up mean
Mama looking clean when she hits the scene
Still got a body that looks nineteen
Just a rock and roll dive bar beauty queen
Pearl snaps popping cause her blouse is loose
Rhinestones don't even shine like you
Bikers, rednecks, cowboys too
Can't get enough of her Daisy Dukes
I love it when her g-string hangs down low
I love it when she dances to rock and roll
I'm loving them hips in them ripped up jeans
Just a rock and roll dive bar beauty queen

Dive bar beauty queen
Living off whiskey and nicotine
Prettiest thing you've ever seen in the dark
She likes Motorhead and Patsy Cline
Smokes the kind and packs a nine
And she's got barbed wire wrapped around her heart

Dive bar beauty queen
Living off whiskey and nicotine
Prettiest thing you've ever seen in the dark
She likes Motorhead and Patsy Cline
Smokes the kind and packs a nine
And she's got barbed wire wrapped around her heart
