Baby, I know you're hurting
Right now you feel like you could never
Love again
Now all I ask is for a chance
To prove that I love you


From the first day
That I saw your smiling face
Honey, I knew that we would
Be together forever
Oh, when I asked you out
You said no, but I found out
Darling that you'd been hurt
You thought that you'd never love again


I deserve a try honey just once
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
You walked in, you were so quick to judge
But honey he's nothing like me


I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me (give you all of me)
Honey, that's no lie (that's no lie)
I'll never break your heart (I'll never break your heart)
I'll never make you cry (I never wanna see you cry)
I'd rather die than live without you (baby, no, no, live without you)
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie


As time goes by
You will get to know me
A little more better
Girl, that's the way love goes baby, baby
And I (I)
Know you're afraid (know you're afraid)
To let your feelings show (feelings show)
And I understand
Girl, it's time to let go
(Girl, it's time to let go because)


I deserve a try (try) honey, just once (once)
Give me a chance (chance) and I'll prove this all wrong (wrong you walked)
You walked in, you were so quick to judge (quick to judge)
But honey he's nothing like me
(Darling why can't you see)


I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry (make you cry)
I'd rather die than live without you (I'd rather die than live without you, girl)
I'll give you all of me (give you all of me, baby)
Honey, that's no lie
I'll never break your heart (your heart)
I'll never make you cry (I'll never make you cry)
I'd rather die than live without you (die, can't live without you)
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie (I'll never break your heart)


I'll never break your heart
No way, know how
Girl, I'll never break your heart
Make you cry
I swear
Oh believe me
I swear, I swear
Honey, I swear
No way, know how
I'll do your right
Girl, I'll never break your heart
Cause I know how!


I'll never break your heart (break your heart, I would never do that to you)
I'll never make you cry (oh, just give me a chance and I'll show you show much I love you)
I'd rather die than live without you (I would die, rather die than live without you)
I'll give you all of me (I would give you the world)
Honey, that's no lie
I'll never break your heart (I'll never, I'll never, I'll never, I'll never)
I'll never make you cry (I'll never, no, I won't)
I'd rather die than live without you (baby, honey, I'd never)
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie (I want you, I need you)
