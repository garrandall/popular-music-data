Somebody help me, yeah
Somebody help me now
Won't somebody tell me
What I've done wrong

When I was just
A little boy of seventeen
I had a girl
She was my queen
She didn't love me like I loved her
Now I know
Now I'm so lonesome on my own

Somebody help me, yeah
Somebody help me now
Won't somebody tell me
What I've done wrong

I need someone in my life
I need a girl to hold me tight
Someone who can make me feel
Make me feel all right

Somebody help me, yeah
Somebody help me now
on't somebody tell me
What I've done wrong

Somebody help me, yeah
Somebody help me now
Somebody help me, yeah
Somebody help me now
Somebody help me, yeah
Somebody help me now
