Let's Limbo some more
Let's Limbo some more
Let's hit the floor like we did before
Let's Limbo some more

Let's Limbo to the Limbo Rock
Let's Limbo to the 
You know the score
Whatsya waitin' for
Let's Limbo some more

We started dancin' at half past nine
Quarter to one we still look fine
And we're still dancin' at half past two 
Now whatsya wanna do

Ha Limbo some more
Let's Limbo some more
Let's hit the floor like we did before
Let's Limbo some more

Limbo some more
Let's Limbo some more
You know the score
Whats ya waitin' for
Let's Limbo some more

Let's Limbo like we did last month
Let's Limbo like we did last year
Well down and down and down we go
Let's Limbo some more

We started dancin' at half past nine
Quarter to one we still look fine
And we're still limbin' at half past two 
Now whats ya wanna do

Everybody gonna Limbo some more
Let's Limbo some more
Let's hit the floor like we did before
Let's Limbo some more

Limbo to the Limbo baby
Limbo are drivin' me crazy
No No Limbo like a slow slow Limbo
With you with you with you...
