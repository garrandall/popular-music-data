When we first met
Stole my heart away
Your love was incredible
Wonderful
Then you began to change
You used to make me feel special
Now all you do is make me cry
I gave you my everything baby
But all you gave me was lies

I, I try to be the one for baby, you you
Never was into nothin'
What I do, do
That's why Im leaving
'Cause it's all about you
And not about me

When we get in a fight
Im always the first to apologize
Even if it was you who did wrong
I never do enough to please you
That's why I can't go on
No matter what I do for you
Its never any good for you
You always got to complain
That's why I got to say
I can't stay

Selfish baby
Anything you want I do
I never understand how you
Could treat me bad and be so cruel
Youre begging me to come back to you
Baby I gave you all my love
But what I had was not enough
You turned around & broke my trust
Got the nerve to ask me
What about us?
