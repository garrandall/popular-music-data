You left a yearning, in my heart
And I can't soothe it, naw, naw, baby
I can't find another thrill, strong enough to remove it
This HEAVY LOVE
It's too high to get over, naw
It's too deep to get under, naw
It's too wide to get around
And it's weighing me down
This HEAVY LOVE, oooweee, baby
It's too high to get over
Watch out you might drown
(Too deep to get under)
It's too deep to get under, baby
It's too wide to get around
And it's weighing me down
Oh why, tell me why
Have I been condemned to love only you
Why, tell me why
Can't I spread my wings and fly above you
To the world beyond

These memories that cloud my mind
I can't erase them - I've tried hard, baby
I can't find another love, strong enough to replace them Aaaawww, naw, oo this HEAVY LOVE
It's so high
(To high to get over)
I can't get over I've tried
Too deep to get under - you might drown
Too wide to get around - and it's weighing me down
Oh why, tell me why
Have I been condemned to love only you
Why, somebody tell me why
Can't I spread my wings and fly above you
To the world beyond
This HEAVY LOVE, baby
It's too high to get over, you can't jump that high
(Too deep to get under) oh, baby, you might drown
(Too wide to get around) you can't get around, Oh baby, and it's weighing me down
It's weighing me down
You got my heart stopped, baby
(Weighing me down)
It's weighing me down, down
This HEAVY LOVE, baby
Too high to get over
It's too deep to get under
It's too wide to get around, baby
And it's weighing me down
It's weighing me down
Aaaww, can't you come back and tell
(Weighing me down)
It's weighing me down
This HEAVY LOVE, baby
It's too high to get over
It's too deep to get under
It's too wide to get around
And it's weighing me down
I want you to understand
(Weighing me down)
It's weighing me down
It's weighing...
This HEAVY LOVE, baby
It's too high to get over
Oh, I can't jump that high, baby
(Too deep to get under)
Oh, it's too deep to get under
It's too wide to get around
And it's weighing me down
Oh, look like I got lead on my legs, baby
(Weighing me down)
Aaww, don't wanna drown

This HEAVY LOVE, baby
Too high to get over
It's too deep to get under
It's too wide to get around
And it's weighing me down
(Weighing me)
Please don't hurt me, baby
With this HEAVY LOVE, aawww, baby
Too high to get over
