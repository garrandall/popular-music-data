Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

I know you don't love me like you used to
Girl, you see me pull up in that new new
Know I'm out here, pushin' heavy pound
Livin' legend, know I'm stickin' 'round
This the type of shit I'm gettin' used to
You ain't changed nothin' since I knew you
I'm still out here puttin' records down
Where you goin'? Why you showin' out?

I just want you to stay here
I don't want you to go home
I just wanted to lay up
I was hoping we could...

Keep applyin' the pressure
'Cause you look so impressive
Keep on pushin' my buttons
I'ma show you how I measure up
Temptations high runnin'
Call me David like Ruffin
Baby show me how you really feel
Take control (Control)
Control me, oh (Me, oh)
I'ma let you take control (Control)
Control me, oh (Me, oh)
Show me how you really feel

All these birds be out here actin' cuckoo (Cuckoo)
'Cause I'm flyin' higher than I used to (Used to)
Trending topic, that's a heavy pound
Doin' numbers, I ain't goin' down
This the type of shit I'm gettin' used to (Used to)
I've been on the come up since I knew you (Since new you)
I ain't average, I'm a savage (Oh)
Livin' lavish, let me show you how (Yeah)

I just want you to stay here (For the night)
I don't want you to go home (Home tonight)
I just wanted to lay up (If it's alright)
I was hopin' we could...

Keep applyin' the pressure (Yeah)
'Cause you look so impressive (Yeah)
Keep on pushin' my buttons (Yeah)
I'ma show you how I measure up (Show you, show you)
Temptations high runnin'
Call me David like Ruffin (Come see you)
Baby show me how you really feel (Uh-huh)
Take control (Ooh)
Control me, oh (Ooh, me, oh)
I'ma let you take control (Ooh)
Control me, oh (Ooh, me, oh)
Show me how you really feel
Keep applyin' the pressure (Yeah)
'Cause you look so impressive (Yeah)
Keep on pushin' my buttons (Yeah)
I'ma show you how I measure up (Show you, show you)
Temptations high runnin'
Call me David like Ruffin (Come see you)
Baby show me how you really feel (Uh-huh)
Take control (Ooh, ooh)
Control me, oh (Ooh, ooh)
I'ma let you take control (Ooh, ooh)
Control me, oh (Ooh, ooh)
Show me how you really feel

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
