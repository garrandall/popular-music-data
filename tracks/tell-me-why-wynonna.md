Everywhere I look the sun is shining
But it's always raining here inside
I can see
You really had a hold on me
It's a mean old love
With a flame that never dies

Won't you tell me why
I can't say goodbye

Everywhere I go you're in my shadow
When I turn around there's no one there
And it's a real bad sign
I'm walking on a real thin line
A fool in love with a fool that never cared

Won't you tell me why
I can't say goodbye
Won't you tell me why

Ask anyone you know
And they'll say love fades away
But this hearts' cryin' just like yesterday

And it's a real bad sign 
I'm walking on a real thin line
A fool in love with a fool that never cared

So won't you tell me why
I can't say goodbye

Won't you tell me why
I can't say goodbye
