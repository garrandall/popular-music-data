La-la-la, mmmÂ­mmmÂ­

Did I ever tell you
How you live in me
Every waking moment
Even in my dreams
And if all this talk is crazy
And you don't know what I mean
Does it really matter, oh
Just as long as I believe

I will love again
Though my heart is breaking
I will love again
Stronger than before
I will love again
Even if it takes a lifetime to get over you
Heaven only knows
I will love again
MmmÂ­I will love again
MmmÂ­oh, yeah

People never tell you
The way they truly feel
I would die for you gladly
If I knew it was for real
So if all this talk sounds crazy
And the words don't come out right
Does it really matter
If it gets me through this night

I will love again
Though my heart is breaking
I will love again
Stronger than before
I will love again
Even if it takes a lifetime to get over you
Heaven only knows

If I'm true to myself
Nobody else can take the place of you
But I've got to move on
Tell me what else can I do ?

I will love again
Though my heart is breaking
I will love again
Stronger than before, mmm
I will love again
Even if it takes a lifetime to get over you
Heaven only knows
I will love again

I will love again
Though my heart is breaking
I will love again
Stronger than before
I, I will love again
Even if it takes a lifetime to get over you
To get over you
Heaven only knows
I know one day I'll love again
I know one day I'll love again

You can't stop me from loving again
Breathing again
Feeling again
I know one day I'll love again, again, again, again, again
