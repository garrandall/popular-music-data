Well, if you want me
Come on and get me
Here I stand
At your command
My heart is yearning
My lips are burning
Come on and get me
Well, if you want me
Come on and get me
Don't be shy
Come on and try
Don't hesitate
Cause I can't wait
Come on and get me
I feel just like a volcano
That's ready to blow
I want your loving kisses
Cause I love you so
And with every kiss
That you give to me
I'll fill your loving heart
With ecstasy
So if you want me
Come on and get me
Here I stand
Your loving man
I want your love tonight
Come on, it's all right
Come on and get me
Come on and get me
Come on and get me
