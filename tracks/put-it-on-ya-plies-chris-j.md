Shorty I wanna know if you come over
If you don't mind girl put your legs up on my shoulders
Don't lie, I can see it in your eyes
You want for you and I to do the freaky things you like
When I put-put-put it on girl, when I put-put-put it on ya
When I put-put-put it on girl, when I put-put-put it on ya
When I put-put-put it on girl, when I put-put-put it on ya
When I put-put-put it on ya, put-put-put it on ya

Let's ride round the city, make love in the car
Let's get on express way, and let me tease you ma
And while you drive baby, I wanna taste your tongue
Pull in to rest area, and let me give you some
You ever been driving while your man made you cum
I wanna hit and stay, I wanna hit and run
Let's pull the car over, and have a little fun
The AC working, so we ain't gotta bun

Can I lick it, can I stick it, can I touch it, can I grab it
Baby tell me can I have it
Can I rub it, can I flip it, can I hold it, can I grip it
Anyway I wanna get it

Shorty I wanna know if you come over
If you don't mind girl put your legs up on my shoulders
Don't lie, I can see it in your eyes
You want for you and I to do the freaky things you like
When I put-put-put it on girl, when I put-put-put it on ya
When I put-put-put it on girl, when I put-put-put it on ya
When I put-put-put it on girl, when I put-put-put it on ya
When I put-put-put it on ya, put-put-put it on ya

If that don't work for ya, I got another idea
Ain't nobody home, so girl come over here
Let's play hide and seek, in our underwear
I find you, I can get it right there
You find me, then I get bare
Either way we both win, now that's fair
Whatever I gotta do to be with you I don't care
You my queen, I'm your king, now that's a nice pair

Can I lick it, can I stick it, can I touch it, can I grab it
Baby tell me can I have it
Can I rub it, can I flip it, can I hold it, can I grip it
Anyway I wanna get it

Shorty I wanna know if you come over
If you don't mind girl put your legs up on my shoulders
Don't lie, I can see it in your eyes
You want for you and I to do those freaky things you like
When I put-put-put it on girl, when I put-put-put it on ya
When I put-put-put it on girl, when I put-put-put it on ya
When I put-put-put it on girl, when I put-put-put it on ya
When I put-put-put it on ya, put-put-put it on ya

Let me grade you, give you a report card
Your first test is, can you get it hard
Show me how good you communicate when we start
Today's pop quiz, to find your hot spot
Wanna see how good your balance is on top
Give you a A+ if you don't stop
This a big test, you looking kinda shocked
Either you get promoted, or you get dropped
Your final exam, show me your wet box
Ain't no tattle teller, I keep my mouth locked
Make you an honor student, show me you back shot
You passed with flying colors, ohthat's a nice twat

Can I lick it, can I stick it, can I touch it, can I grab it
Baby tell me can I have it
Can I rub it, can I flip it, can I hold it, can I grip it
Anyway I wanna get it

Shorty I wanna know if you come over
If you don't mind girl put your legs up on my shoulders
Don't lie, I can see it in your eyes
You want for you and I to do those freaky things you like
When I put-put-put it on girl, when I put-put-put it on ya
When I put-put-put it on girl, when I put-put-put it on ya
When I put-put-put it on girl, when I put-put-put it on ya
When I put-put-put it on ya, put-put-put it on ya
