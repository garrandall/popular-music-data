Long legs, cut off jeans
Pullin' me in like a magnet
Your eyes locked on me
I knew I better had to have you
Right here in the middle of the floor
With this hole in the wall on a backstreet
I knew I had to get close to you

Girl what's your name, what you drinkin'?
Yeah what's your favorite song?
If you're thinkin' what I'm thinkin'
We ain't gonna be in this bar too long
We'll be sneakin' on out to your car
Stealin' kisses out there in the dark
Yeah it might be too soon to say I love you
But you're gonna make me want to

Soft hands touchin' on me
Lightin' me up like a bonfire
Your lips are makin' me think
This is gonna be an all-nighter
Right here in the middle of the crowd
You're the center of the world on a bar stool
Oh yeah I had to get close to you, girl...

What's your name, what you drinkin'?
Yeah what's your favorite song?
If you're thinkin' what I'm thinkin'
We ain't gonna be in this bar too long
We'll be sneakin' on out to your car
Stealin' kisses out there in the dark
Yeah it might be too soon to say I love you
But you're gonna make me want to

We'll be sneakin' on out to your car, car, car
Stealin' kisses out there in the dark, dark, dark

Girl, what's your name, what you drinkin'?
Yeah what's your favorite song?
If you're thinkin' what I'm thinkin'
We ain't gonna be in this bar too long
We'll be sneakin' on out to your car
Stealin' kisses out there in the dark
Yeah it might be too soon to say I love you
But you're gonna make me want to

You're gonna make me want to
You're gonna make me want to, girl, hah
You're gonna make me want to, want to, I want you
