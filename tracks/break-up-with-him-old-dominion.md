Hey girl, what's up?
I know it's late, but I knew you'd pick it up
Naw, I ain't drunk
Okay, maybe I do have a little buzz but
That song came on and I just thought what harm could come from one little call?
I know you say you're taken, but I say girl you're taking too long

To tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl, it's just wasting precious time
Girl, you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a band-aid
The way you look at me, girl, you can't pretend
I know you ain't in love with him, break up with him

I know, you don't wanna break his heart, but that ain't no good reason to be keeping us apart look,
just tell him, it's you, it ain't him,
and maybe you can lie to him and say you'll still be friends
Whatever you got to say to get through to him that you ain't in love
C'mon you can't deny that you and I kinda fit like a glove

So tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl, it's just wasting precious time
Girl, you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a band-aid
It ain't my business to be all up in, but I know you ain't in love with him, break up with him
I know that you're so done with him, break up with him, break up with him

You would've hung up by now if you weren't thinking it too
No pressure, whatever, just do what you gotta do, but if I was you
I'd tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl, it's just wasting precious time
Girl, you know it can't wait
Just rip it off like a band-aid
Yeah, I know I said it, but I'll say it again, I know you ain't in love with him, break up with him
The way you look at me, girl, you can't pretend,
I know you ain't in love with him, break up with him, yeah
Just break up with him
