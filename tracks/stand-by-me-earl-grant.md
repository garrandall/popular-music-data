Come on my music make her snake away
my music make her creep away
my music make her sneak away
every single day
The club scene is filled wit cats who mug mean
my thug team is Skatterman and Snug Brim
Krizz and Grant and Kutty be my buddies wit slug beams.
Joe and Nick and catty Matty open your bloodstreams.
Snake ya make ya broad disrespect ya break I break the One N9ne
grace to face wit pace ya hates the way I make raps erase ya
hearts on brace so he takes echinecea
I ain't come to talk about you and your girl man
if I tell him what I know he'll do the earl thing
It's a pity
how your living in your city
and your kitty is kicking wit me getting grimy and gritty
aight klown I know how this might sound
I heard your womans peeping I'm coming wit tight klowns
we can fight now
or else you can just pipe down
why am I even talking to you right now

I don't know what who she creep wit no
I don't know who else she sleeps wit no
All I know you don't want no beef wit Strange will make ya dang chain to snake ya man

He wit this chick for like 2 or 3 years
she in the club getting lose of like 2 or 3 beers ya know
he done shared 2 or 3 tears before
now here we go again tell you be throwing and mowing and ?
mumbling something bout last night
wat was this cat like
wanna live the fast life
make the jokes let it go you can back it up and if you wanna get back wit her maybe you can patch it up
She chose me to approach me to slowly poke the back out of her rode
the pony and saddled her told me it didn't matter what we was ?
she had a habit and was an addict and had to have it now her boyfriends on to us and he got beef wit me I ain't tripping go
t my piece wit me out numbered got my peeps wit me it Rice G Tech Skatter Snug and BG so well see.

I don't know what who she creep wit no
I don't know who else she sleeps wit no
All I know you don't want no beef wit Strange will make ya dang chain to snake ya man

Its official grab your pistol she told him how we make the municipal licking crystal wit mystical how I hit it was critical then I split then I missed a few rounds tech and christen you down you fished and you found you still insist to be clowned cause here I stand the ? in town and dissing you now I spit till you frown cause you a trick and I'm bound to tell your chick to make me rich you swim in shit and you drown I have now time for the punks I dunk not eager to stick around waiting for funk to jump hes mad at the n9ne cause I put the crunk in the front you been the sherman klump how many lumps do you want still I don't really know who you talking bout if you don't get out my face you wont be walking out but in my mind I remember I sats it down and ate it soft cause I laugh when I told her wretch around and wrench it off cha

I don't know what who she creep wit no
I don't know who else she sleeps wit no
All I know you don't want no beef wit Strange will make ya dang chain to snake ya man

Yo see you all in my face I'm like what I see you all in my space I'm like what I don't know your girlfriend you heard me say so I don't know the girl then

Yo see you all in my face I'm like what I see you all in my space I'm like what I don't know your girlfriend you heard me say so I don't know the girl then
