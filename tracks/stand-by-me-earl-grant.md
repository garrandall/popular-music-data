When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the
Only light we'll see

No, I won't be afraid
No, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

So, darling, darling
Stand by me, oh, stand by me
Oh, stand, stand by me
Stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountains should
Crumble to the sea

I won't cry, I won't cry
No, I won't she'd a tear
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

And darling, darling
Stand by me, oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now, stand by me
Stand by me

Darling, darling
Stand by me, oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now, stand by me
Stand by me

Whenever you're in trouble
Won't you stand by me
Oh, stand by me...
