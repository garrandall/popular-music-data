What's the reason
What's the reason
What's the reason
What's the reason

Tonight
The reason that I care
It isn't fair

Tonight
The reason why I cry
Please tell me why

Oh, oh, oh, oh...

I want to know the reason
What have I done
You are the one

I want to know the reason
I love you so
Want you to know
You're the reason

You're the reason
Why I'm in love
Why do I pray
To the Lord above

Why am I longing
Each night and day
Tell me you want me
Oh, tell me
Tell me you'll stay

I want to know
The reason why I cry
Tell me why

Oh, oh, oh...
(You're the reason)
(You're the reason)
(You're the reason)
Oh, oh, oh...
