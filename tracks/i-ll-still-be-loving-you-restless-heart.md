Changin' my life with your love
Has been so easy for you
And I'm amazed every day
And I'll need you

'Till all the mountains are valleys
And every ocean is dry, my love

I'll be yours
Until the sun doesn't shine
'Till time stands still
Until the winds don't blow

When today is just a memory to me
I know I'll still be loving
I'll still be loving you
I'll still be loving you

Never before did I know
How loving someone could be
Now I can see, you and me
For a lifetime

Until the last moon is rising
You'll see the love in my eyes, my love

I'll be yours
Until the sun doesn't shine
'Till time stands still
Until the winds don't blow

When today is just a memory to me
I know I'll still be loving
I'll still be loving you

I'll be yours
Until the sun doesn't shine
'Till time stands still
Until the winds don't blow

When today is just a memory to me
I know I'll still be loving
I'll still be loving you

I'll still be loving you
I'll still be loving
I'll still be loving you
I'll still be loving
I'll still be loving you
I'll still be loving
I'll still be loving you
