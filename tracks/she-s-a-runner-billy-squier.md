Take my soul to the lost-and-found
Girl she made me a hand-me-down
Never know when she'll come around or what I'll see
No resistance--it's hardly fair
Call my name, honey--I'll be there
I'll give in to you anywhere..so foolishly
I could never ever lie to you
I could never even try
I just wanna be beside you

Sweet emotion'll pass you by
Girl she left me alone to cry
I still remember how she could make love to me
You see the traces--they always show
Some may come and some may go
But one of us will never know what you see
Never wanted to rely on you
Never wanted you to try
I just wanna be beside you

She's a runner...anyone can see
She's a runner...she run all over me
She's a runner...you can't walk away
She's a runner..she can make you stay

I need to listen to my advice
The aggravation ain't worth the price
I can tell ya she won't think twice
She gonna knock down, put ya down..oo yea

She's a runner...anyone can see
She's a runner...she tore it out a me
She's a runner...watch her walk away
She's a runner...you can't make her stay
