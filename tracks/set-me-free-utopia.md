There ain't no reason why you let me wait
Just give me up and I will go, let's set it straight
Got a right to who I am
And if I don't fit your plan then set me free


But you refuse to set me free
And you deny me of my needs
You have me under lock and key
Just set me free, just set me free


You never cared for what I had to say
It's just because you got to have it all your way
Well, I ain't no superman
If that's what you demand then set me free


Couldn't you please just set me free
You get your fun just hurting me
If this is how it's going to be
Just set me free, just set me free


Now I deserve to be as mad as hell because
I just don't get it
I place myself in your hands to fall
But I'm not quitting, no




Feels like the time we spent was going to waste
Sooner or later it's goodbye, we're gonna say
'Cause you just don't give a damn
So go find some other man and set me free


Just don't refuse to set me free
You can't deny me of my needs
Just turn your head to hear my plea
Just set me free, just set me free


Couldn't you please just set me free
You get your fun just hurting me
If this is how it's going to be
Just set me free, just set me free


Just don't refuse to set me free
You can't deny me of my needs
Just turn your head to hear my plea
Just set me free...
