When night and day unite
And dreams turn to dust
Another day to be
Consumed in tragedy
Calamity
You're set up to be free
But the mirror lies to you

Wafting every fear within me
Downing inside
Fatal was your mode this time

Know that you're the one who follows
A fool's utopia
Leave this season in its colors

Your standing on the edge
Beneath a troubled sky
Your faith was all you had
Now it's shattered on the ground
Calamity
Not set up to be weak
But the mirror lies to you

Walking every fear within me
Downing inside
Fatal was your mode this time

Know that you're the one who follows
A fool's utopia
Leave this season in its colors

Calamity
Waking every fear within me
Drowning inside
Fatal was your mode this time

Know that you're the one who follows
A fool's utopia
Leave this season in its colors
Remember you're the one who follows
A fool's utopia

(Know that you're the one who follows)
Leave this season in its colors
