When I look back
On everything I've done
I know you must have cried
A river of tears,
But, you were there
When I was feeling low
To walk me through my darkest fears

So when the sun goes down
An' those nights grow colder,
I will be there
Looking over your shoulder

An' the deeper the love
The stronger the emotion,
An' the stronger the love
The deeper the devotion

There were times
I almost let you go
When I thought I needed to break free,
But you were there
To whisper in my ear
Why don't you share my dreams with me.

So when the sun goes down
An those nights are growing colder
I will be there
Looking over your shoulder.

An' the deeper the love
The stronger the emotion,
An' the stronger the love
The deeper the devotion

I don't mind, what you're doing to me,
I don't mind, 'cause you're all I can see
I don't mind, baby, you mean the world to me

When the sun goes down
An' those nights are growing colder,
I will be there
Looking over your shoulder, baby, baby, baby.

So When the sun goes down
An' those nights are growing colder,
I will be there
Looking over your shoulder.

'Cause the deeper the love
The stronger the emotion,
An' the stronger the love
The deeper the devotion...

I never gonna let you go,
In my heart, I know.
I love you, I love you.
Oh baby, I really love you...
