I don't like to worry
About no one else
I like to be, you know alone and free
I'm happy by myself, yeah

But here comes this girl, whoa, yeah
I've seen 'em all around the world
She looks into me
Looks right through me

Don't you know it hit me like a hammer
Hit me like a ton of lead
You know it hit me like a hammer
You know it hit me, baby, well

I told myself to take it easy
'Cause this won't last long
A day or two, I'll be back in love
And she'll be long gone, yeah

But then she caught my eye, whoa, yeah
I knew that it was all a lie
I started shakin'
My heart was breakin

Don't you know it hit me like a hammer
Hit me like a ton of lead
You know it hit me like a hammer
You know it hit me, baby

And now I can't stop this feelin' I've got
I wanna know
'Cause there's no time to make up my mind
You shocked me, now you got me
If you really want me

Here comes this girl, whoa, yeah
I've seen 'em all around the world
She looks into me
Looked right through me

Don't you know it hit me like a hammer
Hit me like a ton of lead
You know it hit me like a hammer
You know it hit me, baby

You shocked me, now you've got me
You know you hit me like a hammer
You know you hit me like a hammer
Hit me like a five pound sledge
You know it hit me, baby
You know you hit me like a hammer
