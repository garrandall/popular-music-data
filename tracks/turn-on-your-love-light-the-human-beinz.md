Without a warnin'
You broke my heart
You took it darlin'
And you tore it apart
You left me standin'
In the dark cryin'
You said your love
For me was dyin'
Turn on your lights
Let it shine on me
Turn on your lights
Let it shine on me
Let it shine shine
Let it shine
Let it shine shine
Let it shine
Shine on me
I get lonely
In the middle of the night
And I need you darlin'
To make things alright
Turn on your lights
Let it shine on me
Turn on your love light
Let it shine on me
A little bit higher
A little bit higher
A little bit higher
A little bit higher
(a little bit higher)
(a little bit higher)
Turn on your love light
Let it shine on me
(a little bit higher)
(a little bit higher)
Turn on your love light
(a little bit higher)
(a little bit higher)
Turn on your love light
Etc
