When it appears your love is finally on the line,
And you can't hold it back much longer
And when it seems as though you're runnin' out of time,
That's the time you should be stronger,
Well, if you care about her - don't you ever doubt her love,
Would you turn around and throw it all away,
Just let her know today.


That it looks like trouble in paradise,
And you're burnin' alone, that's cold as ice,
Go out and find a flame - so you can warm it up again.

May you always have somebody to depend on,
And may your days be celebrations,
And may there always be an angel on your shoulder,
To cut that awkward situation.
And if you love each other - you'll never need another, oh no,
When the whole wide world has finally got you down,
She'll still be around.


That it looks like trouble in paradise,
And you're burnin' alone, that's cold as ice,
Go out and find a flame - so you can warm it up again.
