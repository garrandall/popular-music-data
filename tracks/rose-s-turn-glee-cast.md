All that work and what did it get me?
Why did I do it?
Scrapbooks full of me in the background.
Give 'em love and what does it get ya?
What does it get ya?
One quick look as each of 'em leaves you.
All your life and what does it get ya?
Thanks a lot and out with the garbage,
They take bows and you're battin' zero.

I had a dream.
I dreamed it for you, Dad.
It wasn't for me, Dad.
And if it wasn't for me
Then where would you be,
Miss Rachel Berry?

Well, someone tell me, when is it my turn?
Don't I get a dream for myself?
Starting now it's gonna be my turn.
Gangway, world, get off of my runway!
Starting now I bat a thousand!
This time, boys, I'm taking the bows and

Everything's coming up Kurt!
Everything's coming up Hummel!
Everything's coming up Kurt!
This time for me!
Hahahahahahaha!

For me! For me! For me! For me! For me! For me! Ya!
