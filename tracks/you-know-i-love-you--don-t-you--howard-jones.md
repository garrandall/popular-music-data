YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU...DON'T YOU?
Howard Jones
You got the socket and I got the plug
I am the floor and you are the rug
I got the rhythm you got the beat
We feel it shake us from our souls to our feet
And you know I Love you
You know I Love you...don't you
You got the metal and I got the die
We make a structure that no one can deny
I need you and you need me
I need your honey like a flower needs a bee
You know I Love you
You know I Love you...don't you
No one is an island on that you can depend
A person on his own is a sinking ship
It will be that way til the time will end
Now don't you worry when things get tough
We'll stick together through the smooth and the rough
Your the steam engine and I am the tracks
Roll over me I'll be rolling right back 'cos
