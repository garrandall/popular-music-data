Just gimme the gees an we be clubbing yow.
Gal a make we please and we be thuggin' now.
Sippin' Hennesy an we'll be bubblin' yow.

Set we mind at ease we got to take it slow.


So when you see the S.P. floating don't provoke him
Cause the girls we be poking have to smoking.
Best thing fi the recreation a fi get the best girls inna every nation.
All Topper girls we promotin' and suportin'
And dem love how we flow king here them shouting
First class ticket invitation girls from New York, England and Jamaican.

We be burnin' not concernin' what nobody wanna say.
We be earnin' dollars turning 'cause we mind de pon we pay.
More than gold and oil and diamonds - girls, we need dem everyday
Some got gold and oil and diamonds - all we got is Mary J
Recognize it, we pimpin' as we riding
Legalize it, time to recognise it


Girls them a page me waan fi raise me
True me write nuff tune and drive them crazy.
Well I man a true born Jamaican
Ready fi the girls them inna every situation.

We a the gal dem pro, them know we flow
With the lyrical content that make them dip low and
Make the club keep jumpin'
Turn up the bass make we here when it pumpin'.

Summertime bounce to the music people choose it
Sean da P gal a cruise with... well reputed cause.
We a the girls them champion,
Have nuff a them like the great king Solomon.

Many girls inna wi eye sight sexy dress type
Se them ready fi a hype night
Just gimme di light
An make we blaze it the roof we haffi raise it again


Everyday...
