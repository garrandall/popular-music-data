The dirty rain is falling
I hear the wind a calling me away
The motel sign is flashing
And in my mind I'm crashing what to say
What to say

The words they started flowing
And passions started growing like years ago
The wine made my mind crazy
But now I'm not so hazy I gotta go
I gotta go

The love we made today
It was just a foolish way
To try to bring back yesterday there ain't no way

The dirty rain is falling
And in my mind it's calling me away
I'm staring at the ceiling
I can't let that feeling make me stay
Oh no, I just can't stay

Oh, the love we made today
It was just a foolish way
To try to bring back yesterday
There ain't no way

Yeah, the love we made today
It was just a foolish way
To try to bring back yesterday
There ain't no way

Yeah, the love we made today
It was just a foolish way
To try to bring back yesterday
There ain't no way

There ain't no way
There ain't no way
