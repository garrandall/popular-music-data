Supernatural love, Supernatural 

Love like a river, 
Flowing deeper than time 
Rushing over my senses, 
Like sweet cherry wine 

Stole my emotion, 
Like a thief in the night 
Love made me an offer, 
I couldn't deny 

You raise me up until I can't see the ground 
Wanna tell the whole world about this love that I found 


Supernatural love 
You're giving me 
Supernatural high 
Oh keep on giving me 
Heaven sent from above 
Heaven sent from above 
Supernatural love 
Oh, supernatural 

I'd like the thank you 
For changing my world 
You made a woman 
From a lost little girl 

My soul was searching 
Searching to find 
Something to cherish 
A love so divine 

I'm hypnotized by feelings I've never felt 
It's like your magic put me under a spell 
Supernatural love 
You're giving me 
Supernatural high 
Oh keep on giving me 
Heaven sent from above 
Heaven sent from above 
Supernatural love 
Oh, supernatural 

Keep on, keep on giving me (Keep on) 
Keep on, keep on giving me (Giving me) 
Keep on giving me Supernatural Love 
Supernatural Love 

Keep on, keep on giving me (It's what I want) 
Keep on, keep on giving me (It's what I need) 
Keep on giving me Supernatural Love 
Supernatural Love 

I'm hypnotized by feelings I've never felt 
It's like your magic put me under a spell 

Supernatural love 
You're giving me 
Supernatural high 
Supernatural high 
Heaven sent from above 
Heaven sent from above 
Supernatural love 
Woo hoo 

Lift me up higher, higher, and higher 
Lift me up higher than I've ever been before yeah 
Lift me up higher, higher, and higher 
With Supernatural love 

Keep on, keep on giving me, 
Keep on, keep on giving me, 
Keep on, keep on giving me, 
Supernatural love 

Keep on, keep on giving me, 
Keep on, keep on giving me, 
Keep on, keep on giving me, 
Supernatural love 

Supernatural love (keep on giving me) 
Keep on giving me something sweet sweet 
Heaven sent from above 
Supernatural love 

Keep on, keep on giving me, 
Keep on, keep on giving me, 
Keep on, keep on giving me, 
Supernatural love 

Keep on, keep on giving me, 
Keep on, keep on giving me, 
Keep on, keep on giving me, 
Supernatural love
