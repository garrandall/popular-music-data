Keep on pushin'
Keep on pushin'

I've got to keep on pushin'
I can't stop now
Move up a little higher
Someway or somehow

'Cause I've got my strength
And it, don't make sense
Not to, keep on pushin'

Hey, Hallelu-jah, Hallelu-jah
Keep on pushin'

Now maybe some day
I'll reach that higher goal
I know, I can make it
With just a, little bit of soul

'Cause I've got my strength
And it, don't make sense
Not to, keep on pushin'

Now look a look, look a look
A look a yonder
A what's that I see
A great big stone, wall
Stands there ahead of me

But I've got my pride
And I'll, move the wall aside
And keep on pushin'

Hey, Hallelu-jah, Hallelu-jah
Keep on pushin'
Keep on pushin'

What I say yeah
Keep on pushin'
Well, that's alright
