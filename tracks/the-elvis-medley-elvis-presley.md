Heavy metal longsleeve made in 1988
Fake nugget wristwatch made in 1988
Dixie cup in the cup holder, shakin', makin' waves
Boom, boom, boom, got Jurassic Park 808's
Ooh, I'm Elvis Presley, 38's on 22's
Rhinestone jacket like Joshua Hedley
Yeah, I got that Honolulu
Flower power, bouquet, medley
'Bout to throw this Chevy in Tom Cruise
And go Trailer Park Hollywood, go Trailer Park Hollywood

Yeah, I got a styrofoam cooler full of cheap suds
Rock a necklace that I pulled off a sink plug
Bubba's in the corner chillin' with the mean mug
Permanently ill, never did king drugs
Did he crack a smile or is it just cracker smiles?
That white trash hood shit, go deep with the crocodiles
That gummo celebrity mullet is fucking popping now
You laid on my vision, you out of touch like a pocket dial
Now hold up, open up the folder, look back in the rolodex
We repping the seat ever since your uncle was smoking boas
Ever since your crooked ass cop daddy, he pulled me over
And took my quarter bag of dope, 'cause he's a smoker
Fuck it, I got a lot where that came from
I know a couple grow spots where that came from
808's rattle in the seat where she came from
Yeah, I keep that bottom 'cause I know where I came from
Still Slum, bitch

Just like a new velvet painting of a pinup girl
We Trailer Park Hollywood, we Trailer Park Hollywood
I still got the dice hanging from my rearview 'cause
I'm Trailer Park Hollywood, I'm Trailer Park Hollywood, Hollywood
Your mama's cigarettes hanging with the heroin, girl
She's Trailer Park Hollywood, she's Trailer Park Hollywood
Just like a new velvet painting of a pinup girl
We Trailer Park Hollywood, Hollywood

British nights, stepping through puddles and drinking Sprite
Baby blue dirt bike, kickstand and the kitchen lights
Diggin' through mama's vinyl collection to the smell of fried bologna's a ceremony
My religion is 'Bama life
No smoke in the mirror tricks, just dope in the mirror with
The seeds in the rolling tray and the box with the poker chips
The roach in the roach clip with the leather and feathers
The bellbottoms and aqua net, the hippies and heavy metal, uh
And the block is hot as a tea kettle
So much dope in the garage you can't park in it
These levels of underground made me a genius with keeping secrets
With a family that's scramblin' police radio signals
So what does your daddy do?
Punch in the clock and growin' pot in the paddy room
And you can't hang unless you get on his latitude
Hip-hop is my lane and rock and roll is my attitude
I stay country fresh, bitch

Just like a new velvet painting of a pinup girl
We Trailer Park Hollywood, we Trailer Park Hollywood
I still got the dice hanging from my rearview 'cause
I'm Trailer Park Hollywood, I'm Trailer Park Hollywood, Hollywood
Your mama's cigarettes hanging with the heroin, girl
She's Trailer Park Hollywood, she's Trailer Park Hollywood
Just like a new velvet painting of a pinup girl
We Trailer Park Hollywood, Hollywood
