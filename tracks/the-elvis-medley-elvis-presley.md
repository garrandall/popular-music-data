Since my baby left me,
Found a new place to dwell.
It was down at the Lonely Street,
At Heartbreak Hotel.
I get so lonely, baby, I get so lonely,
I get so lonely, I can die.

When I walk through that door, baby, be polite.
You're going to make me sore
If you don't treat me right.
Don't you ever kiss me once,
Kiss me twice,
Treat me nice.

Well, it's a one for the money,
Two for the show,
Three to get ready
Now, go, go, go!
Now, don't you step on my blue suede shoes.
Well, you can do anything
But lay offa my blue suede shoes.

Well, that's all right now, mamma,
That's all right with you.
That's all right now, Mamma, just any way you do.
Well, that's all right, baby, that's all right.
That's all right, now, mamma, any way you do.

Well, Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans,
Way back in the woods among the evergreens.
You see the that log cabin made of earth and wood,
Lives a country boy named Johnny B. Goode.
He never learned to read or write so well,
But he can play the guitar just like a rein of Hell!
Go, go!
Go, Johnny, go go go!
Go, Johnny, go go go go...
Go Johnny go go go...
Go, Johnny Go go go... Johnny B. Goode.

Well bless my soul what's wrong with me?
I'm b*tchin' like a man on a fuzzy tree...
My friends say I'm acting queer as a bug,
I'm in love... uh! I'm all shook up!

Uh-uh... uhhh... yeah, yeah, yeah!

Uh-uh... uhhh... yeah, yeah yeah!

You ain't nothin but a hound dog,
Cryin' all the time!
You ain't nothin but a hound dog,
Cryin' all the time...
You ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine.

Since my baby left me,
Found a new place to dwell.
It was down at the Lonely Street,
At Heartbreak Hotel.
I get so lonely, baby, I get so lonely,
I get so lonely, I can die.

Yeah!
