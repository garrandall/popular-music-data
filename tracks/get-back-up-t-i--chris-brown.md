I'm only, I'm only human dog, hello, out there
I'm only human dog, can you, hear me?
I'm only human dog, it's an S.O.S
Ayy, ayy listen to me, to let me, be me


Ayy, when they push you down you got to get back up, I'm only human y'all
Ayy, when they push you down you got to get back up, I'm just a human y'all
Push the dirt, off your jersey then go for the cup (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Or the trophy, or the ring, champion no matter what
'Cause when you got the belt, and the ring
People with you popping bottles, taking pictures, look around (yeah, yeah, yeah)
But soon as you fall down all the haters passing judgment, oh no no
Fly as I'm is shawty, I'ma rise above this, oh no no no no


Hey, what it is world? (Ayy) Yeah, it's me again (again)
Back before you, at your mercy, on bended knee again
No running from the truth (nah), as much as we pretend
That it ain't what it is, then it hits CNN
Apologies to my fans and my closest friends (I'm sorry)
For letting you down, I won't take you down this road again (uh-uh)
Most of you now saying, "Whatever, here we go again" (what?)
Blogs, radio and television all going in (ayy, ayy, ayy)
I laugh to keep from crying through all of the embarrassment (I gotta say)
I gotta say you fucking haters is hilarious (ha ha)
How dare you sit right there and act as if you holier than thou?
Point your finger now (now) with me looking down (down)
Same clown that was Twitpicing at my wedding (ayy, what?)
On the same Twitter page disrespecting, wait a second (hold up)
Never mind my imperfections, this a fact, remember that
No mistake's too great to recover and bounce back


Ayy, when they push you down you got to get back up, I'm only human y'all
Ayy, when they push you down you got to get back up, I'm just a human y'all (you gotta get back up)
Push the dirt, off your jersey then go for the cup (oh, na na)
Or the trophy, or the ring, champion no matter what (oh, na na na na na na)
'Cause when you got the belt, and the ring
People with you popping bottles, taking pictures, look around (yeah, yeah, yeah)
But soon as you fall down all the haters passing judgment, oh no no
Fly as I'm is shawty, I'ma rise above this, oh no no no no


I admit, yeah I done some dumb shit, disappointed erry'body I know (damn)
Try not to hold that against me though (ayy)
My road to redemption has no GPS
So guess that time must be invested for this to be manifested (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yes it's, hard living life in the spotlight
Trying to dodge the haters same time as the cop light (woo)
The Bible say, "Let he without sin cast the stone first" (stone first)
The sinner or the one who judged him, who was wrong first? (Huh)
Yeah, he go to work, never done no drugs up until the Fed
He just drink his liquor, touch his kids, beat his wife instead (damn)
Difference is my shortcomings hit the media
Thanks to TMZ, the AJC and Wikipedia (what?)
See the stairway to heaven while stepping down Jacob's ladder
My good outweigh the bad, God ain't that what really matter? (Nope)
And matter fact, I'm wrong but after that
The good I done in yo' hood, should it over-shadow that?
Got the world laughing at me for the moment
But it gonna be your turn 'fore it's over with, even if you're so legit
That you get a house with a dog and a picket fence (ayy, ayy, ayy)
The people with you then but when they turn on you remember this (ayy, ayy)


Ayy, when they push you down you got to get back up, I'm only human y'all
Ayy, when they push you down you got to get back up, I'm just a human y'all
Push the dirt, off your jersey then go for the cup (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Or the trophy, or the ring, champion no matter what
'Cause when you got the belt, and the ring
People with you popping bottles, taking pictures, look around (yeah, yeah, yeah)
But soon as you fall down all the haters passing judgment, oh no no
Fly as I'm is shawty, I'ma rise above this, oh no no no no


So I say...
Hello, out there (I'm only human dawg)
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
(I'm only human dawg)
It's an S.O.S (oh, oh, oh, oh)
To let me, be me (yeah, ayy)
Hello, out there (You gotta get)
Ayy, you can love me, or either leave me
Can you hear me? (You gotta get)
Before you judge me, just let me be me
It's an S.O.S, to let me be me
(You gotta, gotta believe in me)
Ayy, you can love me, or either leave me
Before you judge me, see life ain't easy (Hey!)
Hello, out there
Yeah, you gon' miss me when I'm gone
Can you, hear me?
I know when I'm gone, I bet you gon' miss me when I'm gone
It's an S.O.S
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
To let me, be me
I know when I'm gone, I bet you gon' miss me when I'm gone
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
I accept full responsibility for all the wrong I've done
If y'all thought I was perfect
I apologize for being human man
But never again partner, you could put my life on that


Ayy, when they push you down you got to get back up, I'm only human y'all
Ayy, when they push you down you got to get back up, I'm just a human y'all
Push the dirt, off your jersey then go for the cup (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Or the trophy, or the ring, champion no matter what (okay)
'Cause when you got the belt, and the ring (yeah)
People with you popping bottles, taking pictures, look around (look around)
But soon as you fall down all the haters passing judgment, oh no no
Fly as I'm is shawty, I'ma rise above this, oh no no no no


Hello, out there, ay you can love me, or either leave me
Can you, hear me? Before you judge me, just let me be me
It's an S.O.S, ay you can love me, or either leave me
To let me, be me, before you judge me, see life ain't easy
