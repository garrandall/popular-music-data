Come on baby let the good times roll, come on baby let me thrill your soul, 
Come on baby let the good times roll, roll all night long 
Come on baby and a listen to this, this is a somethin you just can't miss 
Come on baby let the good times roll, roll all night long 

Come on baby while the thrill is on, come on baby rock me all night long 
Come on baby let the good times roll, roll all night long 
Come on baby just a close the door, come on baby lets a rock some more 
Come on baby let the good times roll, roll all night long 

Feels so good when you're home come on baby rock me all night long 
Come on baby let the good times roll, come on baby let me thrill your soul, 
Come on baby let the good times roll, roll all night long 
Feels so good when you're home come on baby rock me all night long 

Come on baby let the good times roll, come on baby let me thrill your soul, 
Come on baby let the good times roll, roll all night long 
Come on baby let the good times roll...
