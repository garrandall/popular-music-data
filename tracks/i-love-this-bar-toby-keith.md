Well, we got winners
We got losers
Chain smokers and boozers
And we got high-techs
We got bikers
And plenty of thirsty hitchhikers

And the girls next door dress up like movie stars
Hmm, hmm, hmm
I love this bar

We got divorcees
And a big ol' bouncer man
We got dancing girls
We got a damn good band
We got waitresses
Yeah, we got bar flies
We got a dumb ass
We got a wise guy

And if we get too drunk you can sleep out in your car
Uh huh, huh
I sure love this bar

I love my bar
My kind of place
Where just walking through that front door
It puts a big smile on my face

No cover charge
Come as you are
Uh huh, huh
Whoo, I love this bar

I like my truck (I like my truck)
I like my old lady (I like your girlfriend)
I like to take her out to dinner
Take in a movie now and then

But I love my bar
It's my kind of place
We just strolling around the dance floor
Keeps a big smile on my face

It ain't too far
So come as you are
Uh huh, huh
I sure love this bar

'Cause we got  heads
We got  heads
We got a bunch of juicers and potheads
And we got 
Now we got Tahoe
Come on baby, the whole world's gonna 

And we all know just exactly who we are, don't we now
Uh huh, huh
I love this bar, well
Uh huh, huh
I love this bar, whoo yes I do
Yeah man, uh
