(Walkin' the floor)
(Feelin' so blue)
(Smoke cigarettes)
(Drink coffee, too)

I just lay here at night
Toss and I turn
Lovin' you so
How my heart yearns
You're the reason
I don't sleep at night (Don't sleep at night)

Walkin' the floor
Feelin' so blue
Smoke cigarettes
Drink coffee, too
You're the reason
I don't sleep at night (Don't sleep at night)

I'm bettin'
You're not losin' sleep over me
But if I'm wrong
Don't fail to call
You can keep me company (Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)

Sometimes I go for a walk
Take a look at the moon
Strum my guitar
Sing a love tune
Honey, you're the reason
I don't sleep at night (Don't sleep at night)

(Walkin' the floor)
(Feelin' so blue)
(Smoke cigarettes)
(Drink coffee, too)
(Strum my guitar)
(Look at the moon)
(Losin' my sleep over you)

I'm bettin'
You're not losin' sleep over me
But if I'm wrong
Don't fail to call
You can keep me company (Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)

Sometimes I go for a walk
Take a look at the moon
Strum my guitar
And sing a love tune
Honey, you're the reason
I don't sleep at night (Don't sleep at night)

(Walkin' the floor)
(Feelin' so blue)
(Smoke cigarettes)
(Drink coffee, too)
(Strum my guitar)
(Look at the moon)
(Losin' my sleep over you)

You're the reason
You're the reason
You're the reason
You're the reason
You're the reason
