I wanted everything for a little while
Why shouldn't I
I wanted to know what it was like
I pushed you too far
And you started laying down the law
Till I didn't love you anymore


Now you can pull a little bit
And there's a little give and take
And love will stretch a little bit
But finally it's gonna break


Wherever you go I will follow you
'Cause I was wrong
Wherever you go I will follow you
'Cause I was wrong


So there we both were in that little house
Just hanging out
You didn't know what you were about
You turned to me as you were
Threading daisies on a chain
And you said, "It's decision time again"


Now you can pull a little bit
And there's a little give and take
And love will stretch a little bit
But finally it's gonna break


Wherever you go I will follow you
'Cause I was wrong
Wherever you go I will follow you
'Cause I was wrong


And the ground's gonna swallow you
I was wrong
'Cause I was wrong
I was wrong
I was wrong
I wanted everything for a little while
Why shouldn't I
I wanted to know what he was like


Now you can pull a little bit
And there's a little give and take
And love will stretch a little bit
But finally it's gonna break


Wherever you go I will follow you
'Cause I was wrong
Wherever you go I will follow you
'Cause I was wrong
Wherever you go I will follow you
'Cause I was wrong
Wherever you go I will follow you
'Cause I was wrong
Wherever you go I will follow you
'Cause I was wrong
'Cause I was wrong
'Cause I was wrong
I was wrong
I was wrong
