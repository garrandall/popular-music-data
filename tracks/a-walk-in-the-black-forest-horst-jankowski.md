The trees join hands and say, "Hello,"
And suddenly ev'rywhere we go
The sun beams through in fun
The leaves form patterns like a heart
And whisper forever "Never part."
Be true, 'cause I love you
Shadows write words of love across our path;
Birds sing "How lucky those whose love just grows together."
Blades of grass stand on and on
And chatter together in a calm
That's green and so serene
A mem'ry of our walk of love
In a dream, a stream goes by
Reflecting a message from the sky above
And here and there we look around
To see other lovers who have found
Their way
Crickets tap out their symphony in code;
Rabbits run helter skelter finding shelter here
And flowers swaying in the breeze
Look up to the branches of the trees
And sing as birds take wing
All this is true 'cause I love you
