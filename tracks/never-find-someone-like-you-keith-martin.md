Girl you take my breath away and when I'm with someone new.
I'd rather be here with you, baby forever.
My heart belongs to you 'cause I think about you all the time.
You know my love is true when we're together.
I played around girl and I made you cry.
When I looked up you were saying good-bye.
I'm begging you please. I need you so bad.
Don't leave me now you're best that I had.


I'll never, I'll never find someone like you.
I promise it's true no I'll never, I'll never find someone like you.
'Cause I love the way that you hold.
Girl I won't no I won't let you go.
Noone could ever do the way I would make love to you, oh.

All I have is just my heart and my feelings I gave to you.
That's all that I can do is give you forever.
And oh, you don't know that you're hurtin' me.
'Cause it's not just a sexual thang.
I want to share my dreams baby together.
Girl I'm afraid just to give it all up, my hearts tellin' me to hold back on my love.
But when you get close I just want you to know, I start to get weak and I can't let you go.
