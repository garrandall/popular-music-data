I'm dreaming tonight, I'm living back home 
Right!
Yeah...yeah 

Take me back to a south Tallahassee 
Down cross the bridge to my sweet sassafrassy 
Can't stand up on my feet in the city 
Gotta get back to the real nitty gritty 

Yes sir, no sir 
Don't come close to my 
Home sweet home 
Can't catch no dose 
Of my hot tail poon tang sweetheart 
Sweathog ready to make a silk purse 
From a J Paul Getty and his ear 
With her face in her beer 

Home sweet home 

Get out in the field 
Put the mule in the stable 
Ma she's a cookin' 
Put the eats on the table 
Hate's in the city 
And my love's in the meadow 
Hands on the plow 
And my feets in the ghetto 

Stand up, sit down 
Don't do nothing 
It ain't no good when boss man's 
Stuffin' down their throats 
For paper notes 
And their babies cry 
While cities lie at their feet
When you're rockin' the street 

Home sweet home 

Mama, take me home sweet home 

I was the last child 
I'm just a punk in the street
