From the corners of the world they come
The bravest and the best
To write their names in history
And to face the final test

And they gather as they've always done
With one purpose and the one aim
To give their souls and bodies to
The challenge of the game

Olympia, Olympia
Light the flame
And let it burn
Olympia, Olympia
You will teach
And we will learn
We will learn
In your name
We have come
To honor courage
More than glory
More than fame.
We will learn
If we can
The triumph of the spirit
Is the victory of man

And they reach out to each other
To make us all aware
That we celebrate our brotherhood
In the struggles that we share

Olympia, Olympia
Light the flame
And let it burn
Olympia, Olympia
You will teach
And we will learn
We will learn
In your name
We have come
To honor courage
More than glory
More than fame.
We will learn
If we can
The triumph of the spirit
Is the victory of man

And the truth of what you stand for
Will endure when we are gone
Just as long as people dare
To dream
Olympia, Olympia, Olympia
You live on, you live on

Olympia, Olympia
Light the flame
And let it burn
Olympia, Olympia
You will teach
And we will learn
We will learn
In your name
We have come
To honor courage
More than glory
More than fame.
We will learn
If we can
The triumph of the spirit
Is the victory of man
