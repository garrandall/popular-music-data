Wishful crystal 
Water covers everything in blue 
Coolin' water 

Wishful sinful 
Our love is beautiful to see 
I know where I would like to be 
Right back where I came 

Wishful, sinful, wicked blue 
Water covers you 
Wishful, sinful, wicked you 
Can't escape the blue 

Magic risin' 
Sun is shinin' deep beneath the sea 
But not enough for you and me and sunshine 
Love to hear the wind cry 

Wishful sinful 
Our love is beautiful to see 
I know where I would like to be 
Right back where I came 

Wishful, sinful, wicked blue 
Water covers you 
Wishful, sinful, wicked you 
Can't escape the blue 

Love to hear the wind cry 
Love to hear you cry, yeah, yeah
