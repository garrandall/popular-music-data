How men be so greedy
When there's so much left?
All things are God-given
And they all have been blessed
Why can't we be humble
Like the good Lord say?
He promised to exalt us
But love is the way
That's the way God planned it
That's the way God wants it to be
Oh, that's the way God planned it
That's the way God wants it to be
Let not your heart be troubled
Let mourning, sobbing cease
Learn to love your brothers and
And live in perfect peace
Why can't we be humble
Like my Lord say?
He promised to exalt us
But love is the way
That's the way God planned it
That's the way God wants it to be
Yeah, that's the way God planned it
That's the way God wants it to be
Oh, why can't we be humble
Like my Lord said, y'all?
God's gonna exalt us all
But love is the way
Yeah, that's the way God planned it
That's the way God wants it to be
Ya better believe me
That's the way God planned it
That's the way God wants it to be, ya-hey
Why don't you believe me?
That's the way God planned it
That's the way He wants us to be
Love one another
Whoa, man
That's the way God planned it
That's the way God wants it to be
So we can have peace now
We've gotta do it the way God planned it
We gotta do it way He planned it to be
Before we can have peace, y'all
We've gotta do it the way God planned it
We gotta do it the way God wants it to be
That's the way God planned it
