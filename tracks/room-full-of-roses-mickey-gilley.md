If I sent a rose to you
For every time you made me blue
You'd have a room full of roses
And if I sent a rose of white
For every time I cried all night
You'd have a room full of roses

And if I took the petals
I would tear them all apart
I'd be tearing at the roses
Just the way you broke my heart

If someday you're feeling blue
And you could send a roses, maybe too
Don't send me a room full of roses
But I want my arms around you

And if I took the petals
I would tear them all apart
I'd be tearing at the roses
Just the way you broke my heart

If someday you're feeling blue
And you could send a roses, maybe too
Don't send me a room full of roses
But I want my arms around you
