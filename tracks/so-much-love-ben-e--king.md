In the midst of all my darkness, baby
You came along to guide me
You took pity on a lonely man
When you said you'd stand beside me
I'll never forget you for what you've done
I'll never turn my back on you for anyone

'Cause I've got so much love to give you
Baby, I've got so much love to give you
Girl, there's more than enough to last a whole life through
And it's all for you

My world was cold and empty
And my life was so unfilling
When I needed someone to pick me up
Oh girl, you were oh-so-willing
Now to you that might seem like a little thing
But to me it's like changing winter to spring

I've got so much love to give you
Baby, I've got so much love to give you
Girl, there's more than enough to last a whole life through
And it's all for you

There's so few women nowadays
Who understand the soul of a man
They're always on the taking end
Never giving, never offering a helping hand
But baby, I can count on you
Whenever trouble calls, you see me through
You show your love, babe, in so many ways
I'm gonna love you, baby, the rest of my days

Baby, I've got so much love to give you
Baby, I've got so much love to give you
Well, there's more than enough to last a whole life through
And it's all for you
