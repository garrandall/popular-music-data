Well you know that I'm not a gambler
But I'm being gambled on
They put in a nickel and I sing a little song
Da-da-da-da...
They put in a nickel and I sing a little song

Well, I don't mind that they're lucky
But it seems that they always win
And gamblin' is illegal in the state of mind I'm in
And if I had a nickel for each time that
I've been put on
I would be their nickel man
And I'd sing a little song

They're only putting in a nickel and
They want a dollar song
They're only putting in a little to
Get rid of a lot that's
Wrong

Well I don't know so many things
But I know what's been goin' on
We're only putting in a little
To get rid of a lot that's wrong
And if we had a nickel for each time that
We've been put on
We'd all be their nickel man
And we'd sing a nickel song
You know they're only putting in a nickel
And they win a dollar song
Oh, yeah, they're only putting in a little
To get rid of a lot that's wrong
Oh, they're only putting in a nickel
To win a dollar song
