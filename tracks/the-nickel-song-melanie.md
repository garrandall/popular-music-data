Nickel song
*With refrain from music! music! music!
* Put another nickel in
In the nickelodeon
All i ever want from you is music
I'll do anything for you anything you want me to
All i ever, all i ever wanted was music
Well you know that i'm not a gambler but i'm being gambled on
They put in a nickel and i sing a little song
In the nickelodeon
All i ever, all i ever, wanted was music
Well i don't mind that
They're lucky but it seems like they always win
And gambling is illegal in the state of mind i'm in
And if i had a nickel for each time that i've been put on
I would be their nickel man and i'd sing a little song
You know they're only putting in a nickel
And they want a dollar song, oh
They're only putting in a nickel
And they want a dollar song
Oh yeah, all i ever wanted was the music
I'll do anything for you anything you want me to

All i ever all i ever wanted was music sweet music
They're only puttin' in a nickel
To get rid of a lot that's wrong
Oh you know they're only puttin' in a nickel
And they want a dollar song
They're only puttin' in a nickel
And they want a dollar song

Yeah...
