Nickel song
*With refrain from music! music! music!
* Put another nickel in
In the nickelodeon
All I ever want from you is music
I'll do anything for you anything you want me to
All I ever, all I ever wanted was music
Well you know that I'm not a gambler but I'm being gambled on
They put in a nickel and I sing a little song
In the nickelodeon
All I ever, all I ever, wanted was music
Well I don't mind that
They're lucky but it seems like they always win
And gambling is illegal in the state of mind I'm in
And if I had a nickel for each time that I've been put on
I would be their nickel man and I'd sing a little song
You know they're only putting in a nickel
And they want a dollar song, oh
They're only putting in a nickel
And they want a dollar song
Oh yeah, all I ever wanted was the music
I'll do anything for you anything you want me to

All I ever all I ever wanted was music sweet music
They're only puttin' in a nickel
To get rid of a lot that's wrong
Oh you know they're only puttin' in a nickel
And they want a dollar song
They're only puttin' in a nickel
And they want a dollar song

Yeah...
