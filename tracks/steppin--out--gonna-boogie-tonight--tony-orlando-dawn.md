No, I'm not upset, I'm not, lots of people get married
Please, I'm in a hurry, won't you straighten my tie? I'll get by
She was something else, she was, now, she's gonna get married
She's got herself carried off by somebody new, what can I do?

Don't worry 'bout me, ma, I'll be alright
I'm steppin' out, I'm gonna boogie tonight
Dancing and singing love songs 'til the dawn's early light
Oh, I'm steppin' out, I'm gonna boogie tonight

Yes, I must admit, we did, we looked so good together
Thought it would last forever but I'm a dreamer at heart
Dreams fall apart, tell me where's my shoes, my groovy shoes?
Enough about Diana, oh my sweet Diana, she's getting married today

Oh, don't worry 'bout me, ma, I'll be alright
I'm steppin' out, I'm gonna boogie tonight
Dancing and singing love songs 'til the dawn's early light
Oh, I'm steppin' out, ma, I'm gonna boogie tonight

Oh, my tender lips, they lied
And they told me that she loved me
I'm just catching cold, ma
These aren't tears in my eyes

So don't worry 'bout me, Ma, I'll be alright
See, I'm steppin' out, I'm gonna boogie tonight
Dancing and singing love songs 'til the dawn's early light
Oh, I'm steppin' out, Ma, I'm gonna boogie tonight

Dancing and singing, don't worry, I'll be alright
I'm steppin' out tonight, oh dancing and singing
