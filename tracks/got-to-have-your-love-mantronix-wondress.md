Every time I close my eyes
I can clearly see the image of your smile
Shine through my darkest dreams
I never thought that I'd find myself this close, this close
To you, my dear, tell me what it means
I can feel your sweet caress wash away all the loneliness
That I once felt inside my heart
Boy, if you could read my mind I'm sure that you would find
What you've been searching for, what you've been searching for


Free me from despair (Free me), there's so much to share
If you surrender to me
Whisper in my ears words I long to hear
Woo ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh ooh ooh


(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
Boy, I got to have your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
You know, you know, you know I need your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
Boy, I got to have your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart, ha-ha-heart)
You know, you know, you know I need your love, ooh


You're like an angel in disguise
I feel like I'm in heaven when you walk my way
You're such a mystery (Such a mystery)
The butterflies I feel inside must be (must be), must be (must be)
A sign of love, no one can disagree
My desire for your love is like a new horizon
Only lovers see like you and I, I
Sacred love will be the start to sacred nights, our hearts
I'll love you 'til my dying day, until my dying day


Free me from despair (Free me), there's so much to share
If you surrender to me (To me, to me, to me)
Whisper in my ears words I long to hear
Oh oh whoa whoa oh


(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
Boy, I got to have your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
You know, you know, you know I need your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
Boy, I got to have your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart, ha-ha-heart)
You know, you know, you know I need your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
Boy, I got to have your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
You know, you know I need your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
Boy, I got to have your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart, ha-ha-heart)
You know, you know, you know I need your love
Free me (Gotta find a way to get into your heart) from despair
I want your love, got to have your love
Whisper (Gotta find a way to get into your heart) in my ears
Got to find a way to get into your heart
Tell me (Gotta find a way to get into your heart) that you are mine
Boy, I've got to have your love
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart, ha-ha-heart)
Free me from despair, yeah
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
There's so much to share
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
Whisper in my ear
(Gotta find a way to get into your heart)
