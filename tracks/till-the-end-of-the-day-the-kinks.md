Baby, I feel good
From the moment I arise
Feel good from morning
Till the end of the day
Till the end of the day

Yeah, you and me
We live this life
From when we get up
Till we go sleep at night
You and me were free
We do as we please, yeah
From morning, till the end of the day
Till the end of the day

Yeah, I get up
And I see the sun up
And I feel good, yeah
'Cause my life has begun
You and me were free
We do as we please, yeah
From morning, till the end of the day
Till the end of the day

You and me were free
We do as we please, yeah
From morning, till the end of the day
Till the end of the day
Till the end of the day
Till the end of the day
Till the end of the day
Till the end of the day
