Live long enough you're bound to find
Moonshine'll make a man go blind
Never can tell what the brew will do
But there's times you'll wind up feelin so fine

Some women seem to have a knack
They'll turn you on and leave you flat
Never can tell who's playin for keeps
So tell me now what's holding you back
I know your heart can take it

Don't fight it
Don't fight it
Don't fight it
It'll do your heart so good
Don't fight it
Don't fight it
Don't fight it
It'll only do you good

Don't fight it'll do your heart so good
Do what mama do
Do what daddy do
When you gonna make up your mind
You can run but love will find you
Ready or not here it comes

Some people when they hear a groove
Shake their heads cause they just can't approve
Well I turn up the music till it's shakin the sky
Is everybody ready to move

There's times you wanna shake yourself
There's nights you wanna yell for help
You can fly when you're standing still
N there's nothing wrong with raising some hell
Tonight we're gonna raise it

Don't fight it
Don't fight it
Don't fight it
Don't fight it

Don't fight it
Don't fight it
Don't fight it'll do your heart so good
Don't fight it
Don't fight it
Don't fight it
Don't fight it
