You smiled that misty way and something in my said
Remember the last time
Don't fall in love

I walked so blindly in
I fell and hurt my head
Oh I can't forget it
And I won't regret it
I couldn't even stop it if I tried

Only this time I'm going in with my eyes open
I won't make the same mistakes again
This time Ill see the signs and no hearts broken
Won't be so blind and lose my way

It'd be so nice to love
Don't let it end the same
If you get uneasy just let me know
Don't lie or call me by somebody else's name
Oh I couldn't take it
I know it would break it
And I wanna give you
Everything I am

Only this time I'm going in with my eyes open
I won't make the same mistakes again
This time I'll see the signs and no hearts broken
Won't be so blind and lose my way

This time I'm going in with my eyes open
I won't make the same mistakes again
This time I'll see the signs and no hearts broken
Won't be so blind and lose my way
