Well, I was rollin' down the highway
See my baby, Ruth
Car broke down, tire blew out
Found a telephone booth

I tried to call my honey
What was the sound I had to hear
(Buzz buzz a-diddle-it) in my ear?
(Buzz buzz a-diddle-it)
It's some endless yakkin' hound dog
Hawkin' and sweet talkin' to my dear
(Buzz buzz a-diddle-it)
(Buzz buzz a-diddle-it)

Central seven
Who's on that line?
Break through to my baby
Three-o-ninety-nine

Oh, S.O.S., sweet mama
Switch me to Heaven, get me through
(Buzz buzz a-diddle-it)
(Buzz buzz a-diddle-it)
Telephone operator
Our lovin' future hangs on you
(Buzz buzz a-diddle-it)
(Buzz buzz a-diddle-it) Hang on

Central seven
Who's on that line?
Break through to my baby
Three-o-ninety-nine

Oh, S.O.S., sweet mama
Switch me to Heaven, get me through
(Buzz buzz a-diddle-it)
(Buzz buzz a-diddle-it)
Telephone operator
My lovin' future hangs on you
(Buzz buzz a-diddle-it)
(Buzz buzz a-diddle-it)

Come on, honey (Buzz buzz a-diddle-it)
Get my baby (Buzz buzz a-diddle-it)
Come on, sugar (Buzz buzz a-diddle-it)
Get me honey (Buzz buzz a-diddle-it)
Talk to me, baby (Buzz buzz a-diddle-it)
Come on, honey (Buzz buzz a-diddle-it)
Get my baby
