Mmmm...
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you

You know, in your lifetime
You're gonna have many broken hearts
And sometimes you can't always finish
You can't finish the things that you start

You know, somebody's gotta win and
And, and somebody's always gotta lose
But I want you to remember this
While you're out there paying your dues

You've got to give a little, take a little
And let your poor heart break a little
That's the story of, that's the glory of
Love, of love, love, love, love

You've got to win a little, lose a little
And always have, always have
The blues just a little
That's the story of, that's the glory of
Love, of love, of love, of love, of love

As long, girl
As there's the two of us
We'll have the world
And all of it's charms

But, baby, when
When this world is all through with us
We'll have each other's charms

Love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, oh, love

You've got to win, sometimes lose
Sometimes win, sometimes lose
Always have the blues, always the blues
Love, love, love, love, love, love

In your lifetime
You gotta win, you gotta lose
Always, I want you to remember
I love you, baby

Love, love, love...
