For all the times that we,
We ever wouldn't be,
Look at us baby,
Look at us now,
For everyday that I should have you by my side,
We'll make it baby,
Look at us now,

For every night I pray,
I know that you will stay,
Look at us baby,
Look at us now,

Remembering the time our love was not so fine,
We made it baby,
Look at us now,
Baby look at us,

Everybody believed we would never be,
Look at us up above,
We are so in love,
Everyday in your arms,
Baby can't go wrong we are strong look at us now,

For all the times that we,
We ever were to be,
Look at us baby,
Look at us now,
For everyday that I should have you by my side,
We'll make it baby,
Look at us now,

For every night I pray,
I know that you will stay,
Look at us baby,
Look at us now,

Remembering the time,
Our love was not so fine,
We made it baby,
Look at us

Baby look at us,
Baby look at us,
Baby look at us.
