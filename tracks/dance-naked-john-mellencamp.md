I want you to dance naked
So I can see you
I'd like to get to know you
You don't have to act naughty

Spin it round and round
Spin it round and round and round

I want you to dance naked
I promise I won't touch you
I promise to tell no one, no
I want you to dance naked

Spin it round and round
Spin it round and round and round
Spin it round and round

I want you to dance naked
If you like I'll join you
I want to enjoy your body
I want to hear all your secrets
I want to know if you like me
As much as I like you
I want you to dance naked
But only if you want to

Spin it round and round
Spin it round and round and round
Spin it round and round

I want you to dance naked
So I can see you
I'd like to get to know you
But only if you want to

Spin it round and round
Spin it round and round and round
Spin it round and round
Spin it round and round and round
I want you to dance naked
