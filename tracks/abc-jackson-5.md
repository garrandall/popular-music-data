Uh-huh huh huhhh
Let me tell ya now, hh-huh
(Mmhhmmm)


When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch, one glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look


Oh, baby, give me one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me back in your heart?
Oh, darlin', I was blind to let you go
(Let you go, baby)
But now, since I see you in his arms
(I want you back)

Yes, I do now
(I want you back)
Oh, oh, baby
(I want you back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I want you back
Na, na, na, na
(I want you back)

Uh-buh-buh-buh-buh buh
(Uh-buh-buh-buh-buh buh)


You went to school to learn girl
Things you never, never knew before
Like "I" before "E" except after "C"
And why 2 plus 2 makes 4
Now, now, now, I'm gonna teach you
(Teach you, teach you)
All about love, girl
(All about love)
Sit yourself down, take a seat
All you gotta do is repeat after me


A B C
Easy as, 1 2 3
As simple as, do re mi
A B C, 1 2 3
Baby, you and me, girl
A B C
It's easy, it's like counting up to 3
1 2 3
Sing a simple melody
Do re mi, ABC
That's how easy love can be
That's how easy love can be
Sing a simple melody (That's how easy can be)
1 2 3, you and me

Hi-ya!
Sit down girl
I think I love ya
And all I want you to do is repeat after me
Say 'ABC' (ABC)
Say 1 2 3 (1 2 3)
ABC (ABC)
Say 1 2 3 (1 2 3)

Shake it, shake it baby, come on now
Shake it, shake it baby, oh, oh
Shake it, shake it baby, ho
1 2 3 baby, oh oh
A B C baby, nah nah
Do re mi, baby, oh
That's how easy love can be

A B C it's easy
It's like counting up to 3
Sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be


Stop! Nanana! You'd better save it!
Stop, stop, stop, you'd better save it!
Woo!


Stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, take it slow
Or some day you'll be all alone
You'd better stop the love you save may be your own
Darling, look both ways before you cross me
You're headed for a danger zone


Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on

S is for "Save it"
T is for "Take it slow"
O is for "Oh, no"
P is for "Please, please, don't go! "
