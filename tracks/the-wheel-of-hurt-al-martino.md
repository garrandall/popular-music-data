When the wheel of hurt
Comes wheeling round to you

You're gonna know
What it means to be lonely
You're gonna know
What it meants to be blue

You're gonna know how it feels
To feel your heart breaking in two
When the wheel of hurt
Comes wheeling round to you

I'll see you crying bitter tears
One day, baby (one day, baby)
I'll hear you say you're sorry
We are through (sorry we're through)

But I'll be the first one to help you
Cause you need someone that's true
When the wheel of hurt
Comes wheeling round to you

You're gonna learn the truth the hard way
And when you do, you'll always know
That it's bad luck to hurt somebody
When that somebody loves you so

It may be today or it
May be tomorrow (may be tomorrow)
You'll have to pay
When your payment is due
(Payment is due)

And maybe then you'll realize
How much pain you've put me through
When the wheel of hurt
Comes wheeling round to you

When the wheel of hurt
Comes wheeling round to you
