Oh baby girl, last night
Hands down
One of the best nights
That I've had no doubt
Between that bottle of wine
And that look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Well then we danced in the dark under September stars
In the pouring rain

And I know (and I know) that I can't (that I can't)
Ever tell you know enough
All I need (all I need) in this life (in this life)
Is your crazy love

If I never get to see the Northern Lights
If I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I've got is your hand in my hand
Maybe I can die a happy man
Oh yeah I could, baby
Die a happy man, baby
Yeah

Oh baby that red dress
Brings me to my knees
Oh but that black dress shawty
Makes it hard to breath
You're a saint, you're a goddess, the cutest, the hottest
A masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you
In my wildest dreams

And I know (and I know) that I can't (that I can't)
Ever tell you enough
All I need (all I need) in this life (in this life)
Is your crazy love

If I never get to see the Northern Lights
If I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I've got is your hand in my hand
Maybe I can die a happy man

I don't need no vacation
No fancy destination
Baby you're my great escape, yeah
And we can stay at home
Listen to the radio
Or dance around the fireplace

If I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Drive a sports car up the coast to California
Oh, if all I've got is your hand in my hand
Maybe I can die a happy man
Oh, if all I've got is your hand in my hand
Maybe I can die a happy man
Oh yeah I could, baby
I'd die a happy man, baby
Yeah
I could die, I could die a happy man
I'd die a happy man, baby
Yeah
