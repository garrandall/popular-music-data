And if you really love me won't you tell me
And if you really love me won't you tell me
And if you really love me won't you tell me
Then I won't have to be
Playing around


You call my name
Oh so sweet
To make your kiss incomplete
When your mood is clear
You quickly change your ways
Then you say I'm untrue
What am I supposed to do
Be a fool who sits alone waiting for you


And if you really love me won't you tell me
And if you really love me won't you tell me
And if you really love me won't you tell me (yeah)
Then I won't have to be
Playing around


I see the light of your smile
Calling me all the while
You are saying baby
It's time to go
First the feeling's alright
Then it's gone from sight
So I'm taking out this time to say
Oh oh


And if you really love me won't you tell me
And if you really love me won't you tell me
And if you really love me won't you tell me, baby tell me
Then I won't have to be
Playing around
Playing around (oh Yeah)
Playing around


Hey yeah
Goofing around no
Oh baby
Playing around no
Let me know how you feel baby (oh oh)
Hey oh baby
Playing around no (oh oh)
