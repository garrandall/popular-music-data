(James) Man I luv this shit
Man I luv this shit (Okay)
Man I luv this shit
Man I luv this shit
And I luv this shit (Okay)
And I luv this shit
And I luv this shit
(Luv it, luv it, luv it - HAH!)

It's 2 o'clock and I'm faded, this kush feeling amazing
Got a voicemail on my phone from a lil' breezy feeling X-rated
She told a nigga she hurtin', I'm in the car and I'm swervin
I walked into her bedroom, I put it down that's certain
Man I stay on that Ciroc, man I stay takin' shots
May your girl be on my jock, maybe because I'm everything your not
See I ain't no bitch nigga, no rich nigga, no snitch nigga
I'mma real nigga, that's real nigga - I'm just trying to chill cause
I'm way too drunk to be talking like this
I'm way too high to be trippin like this
I'm way too young to be livin like this
Ask me why I do it? I'ma put it like this

Goddammit I luv it, I luv it
I luv it, I luv it
Goddammit I luv it, I luv it
I luv it, I luv it
So I'ma keep on drinking cause I luv this shit
And Ima keep on smoking cause I luv this shit
And I'ma keep on grindin cause I luv this shit
She tell me keep fuckin cause she luv this shit; and I luv it

Rollin through my hood rolling up some good
Shorty lips be rolling on the wood - damn she rode it good
Rollin over I ain't sleepin over, now she, rollin the eye
Rollin on the floor laughing cause she looks so surprised
Girl, you been around the block, and I been on that Ciroc
Got your man circling your block, maybe because I'm everything you're not
See I ain't no bitch nigga, no rich nigga, no stitch nigga
I'mma real nigga, that's real nigga - I'm just tryin' to chill cause
I'm way too drunk to be talkin' like this
I'm way too high to be trippin' like this
I'm way too young to be livin' like this
Ask me why I do it? I'mma put it like this

Goddammit I luv it, I luv it
I luv it, I luv it
Goddammit I luv it, I luv it
I luv it, I luv it
So I'ma keep on drinking cause I luv this shit
And Ima keep on smoking cause I luv this shit
And I'ma keep on grindin cause I luv this shit
She tell me keep fuckin cause she luv this shit; and I luv it

James, uh...
What you know about love? (Hah), well love know about you
When I try something new, you refuse to believe that my love is true (goddamn)
So I use all I got to prove to you but the proof ain't enough so you move on
To the next dude li-li-li-like "what he gon do?" (Ha)
I don't understand this girls (girls, girls, girls, girls)
I don't understand this girls (girls, girls, girls, girls)
Looking for a real nigga like in all the wrong places (stupid)
And all the wrong ways; they don't care, they don't change cause
She gon do what she want and that is okay (okay)
And he gon do what he want and that is okay (okay)
I said I luv it, luv it, luv it, luv it, luv it, luv it, luv it
He don't nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' about it
Lil bitch!

Goddammit I luv it, I luv it
I luv it, I luv it
Goddammit I luv it, I luv it
I luv it, I luv it
So I'ma keep on drinking cause I luv this shit
And Ima keep on smoking cause I luv this shit
And I'ma keep on grindin cause I luv this shit
She tell me keep fuckin cause she luv this shit; and I luv it
