Oh, you hold in your hand a diamond
The left held it tight
And you hold in your hand our love
You let it fall from the right

I fell for the love and it cost me
Another painful night
This time I'm afraid you lost me
And without a fight

Girl, it's so strange
Now my life's rearranged
How you want to say goodbye again

Oh, oh, girl, it's so strange
How your feelings can change
Are they real, are they only pretend

Oh, girl, I don't need you
I never want to see you
Do you understand

Oh, girl, I don't need you
I never want to see you
Do you understand

Oh, girl, I don't need you
I never want to see you
Do you understand

And now that you have my heart
You walk away
One thing we never learned
Is how to make love stay

Oh, love is a lethal weapon
If you use it wrong
You carry with you my affection
But it's true, we don't belong

Girl, it's so strange
Now my life's rearranged
How you want to say goodbye again

Oh, girl, I don't need you
I never want to see you
Do you understand

Oh, girl, I don't need you
I never want to see you
Do you understand

Oh, girl, I don't need you
I never want to see you
Do you understand

Oh, girl, I don't need you
I never want to see you
Do you understand

Oh, girl, I don't need you
I never want to see you
Do you understand

Oh, you held in your hand a diamond
The left held it tight
Oh, you held in your hand our love
It fell from the right

In closing, I remind you
Don't be callous with a heart
Love is just one step behind you
You'll wait for it if you're smart
