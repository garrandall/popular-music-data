I've been alive forever
And I wrote the very first song
I put the words and melodies together
I am music and I write the songs


I write the songs that make the whole world sing
I write the songs of love and special things
I write the songs that make the young girls cry
I write the songs, I write the songs

My home lies deep within you
And I've got my own place in your soul
Now when I look out through your eyes
I am young again even though I'm very old



My music makes you dance and gives you spirit to take a chance
And I wrote some rock 'n' roll so you can move
Music fills your heart and that's a real fine way to start
It's from me, it's for you, it's from you, it's for me
It's a worldwide symphony



Yeah! I write the songs that make the whole world scream!
I write the songs of love and special things
I write the songs that make the young girls cry
I write the songs, I write the songs

I am music (music) and I write the songs
Yeah
