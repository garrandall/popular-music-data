I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
Let me hold yo' hand
Try to understand

I want a girl like you
Tell my troubles to
You won't be afraid
You heard what I said

Let the four wind blow
Let 'em blow, let 'em blow
From the east to the west
I love you the best

Let the four wind blow
Let 'em blow, let 'em blow
From the east to the west
I love you the best

I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
Let me hold yo' hand
Try to understand

I want a girl like you
Tell my troubles to
Don't be afraid
You heard what I said

Let the four wind blow
Let 'em blow, let 'em blow
From the east to the west
I love you the best

Let the four wind blow
Let 'em blow, let 'em blow
From east to the west
I love you the best
