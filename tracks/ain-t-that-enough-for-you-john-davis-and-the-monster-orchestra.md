I'll do anything to make you mine
I wanna be here with you all the time
I'll give you everything you need
Everything, can't do no more, oh

Ain't that enough for you
Oh, ain't that enough for you
There's nothing more I can do
So ain't that enough for you

I'll make you happy here with me
I'll give you all the love you need
I'll give you loving every night
Til the morning light
Can't do no more, oh

Ain't that enough for you
Oh, ain't that enough for you
There's nothing more I can do
So ain't that enough for you

Ain't that enough
Ain't that enough
Ain't that enough for you

Ain't that enough
Ain't that enough
Ain't that enough for you

Ain't that enough
Ain't that enough
Ain't that enough for you

Ain't that enough
Ain't that enough
Ain't that enough for you

I'll do anything to make you mine
I wanna be here with you all the time
I'll give you everything you need
Everything, can't do no more, oh

Ain't that enough for you
Oh, ain't that enough for you
There's nothing more I can do
So ain't that enough

Ain't that enough for you
Oh, ain't that enough for you
There's nothing more I can do
So ain't that enough

Ain't that enough for you
Oh, ain't that enough for you
Ain't that enough for you
Oh, ain't that enough for you

There's nothing more I can do
So ain't that enough
There's nothing more I can do
So ain't that enough...
