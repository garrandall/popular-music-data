So tell me baby
Whatchu wanna do?
We got all night

So baby it's on, it's on, it's on, yeah
Deeper, deeper baby
Deeper than he's ever gone
Cuz I can go on and on and on

You've got to show me lady
Just how you feel
I want to relax your mind
And go so deep
Because I can go deeper baby
Deeper than he's ever gone
Cuz I need it, and you want it
Cuz you've got what I want and I want what's inside

1 - Can we do it on the low
Keep the lights down
I can do a sex move and get funkey
Workin' it like it ain't no thing
Makin' it sweet in the sheets
From your head down to your feet

2 - Deeper, deeper baby
Deeper than he's ever gone
So baby it's on, it's on, it's on
I can go deeper, deeper baby
Deeper than he's ever gone
Cuz I can go on, and on, and on

Champagne and candlelights would be nice
Just me and you
Let's start things off right tonight
Girl, what should we do babe
Let's sit and fantasize about me and you
We're takin' it up and down and round and round
Givin' you everything that you need

Repeat 1
Repeat 2

Deeper baby, deeper baby
Deeper than he's ever gone
Deeper baby, deeper baby
Deeper than he's ever gone

I can go deep if you let me
I can go deep if you want me
I can go deep when you want me to
I can go deep

I can go deep if you let me
I can go deep if you want me
I can go deep when you want me to
I can go deep

Repeat 2 until fade
