When we walk down the street
Oh, we don't care who we see or who we meet
Don't have to run (run), don't have to hide (hide)
'Cause we have something burning inside


'Cause we got love (love) power (power)
And it's the greatest power of them all
Oh, we've got love(love) power (power)
And together we cannot fall
Sometimes we're up (up), sometimes we're down (down)
But our feet are always on the ground
We always laugh (laugh), don't have to cry (cry)
And this is the reason why:
'Cause we got love (love) power (power)
And it's the greatest power of them all, hey, hey, hey!
We've got love (love) power (power)
And together we cannot fall


Hey, sometimes we're up (up), sometimes we're down (down)
But out feet are always on the ground
We always laugh (laugh), we don't have to cry (cry)
And this is the reason why:
'Cause we got love (love) power (power)
And it's the greatest power of them all, hey,hey, hey!
We got love (love) power (power)
And together we can't fall, hey, hey, hey
We got love (love) power (power)
And it's the greatest power of them all, hey, hey, hey...
