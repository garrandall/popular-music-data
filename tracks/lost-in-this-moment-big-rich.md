I see your momma and the candles
And the tears and roses
I see your daddy walk his daughter down the aisle
I feel my knees start to tremble as I tell the preacher
Don't she look beautiful tonight

All the wonderful words in my head I've been thinkin'
You know I wanna say them all just right
I lift your veil and angels start singin'
Such a heavenly sight yeah


Lost in this moment with you
I am completely consumed
My feelings so absolute
There's no doubt
Sealing our love with a kiss
Waiting my whole life for this
Watching all my dreams come true
Lost in this moment with you

I smell the jasmine floatin' in the air like a love song
Watch my words draw sweet tears from your eyes
We bow our heads while the preacher talks to Jesus
Please bless this brand new life yeah


Lost in this moment with you
I am completely consumed
My feelings so absolute
There's no doubt
Sealing our love with a kiss
Waiting my whole life for this
Watching all my dreams come true
Lost in this moment with you yeah
Lost in this moment with you
I am completely consumed
My feelings so absolute
There's no doubt
Sealing our love with a kiss
Waiting my whole life for this
Watching all my dreams come true
Lost in this moment with you
Lost in the moment (in the moment)
In this moment with you
Lost in the moment yeah
Lost in the moment (in the moment)
In this moment with you
Lost in the moment yeah
