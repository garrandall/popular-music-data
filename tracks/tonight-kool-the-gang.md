Tonight, oh
This is the night you'll see the light
Tonight, oh
This is the night you'll see the light

My 16th birthday I was so shy
Not yet a man but ready to try
Music playin', people swayin'
I looked around she caught my eye

Walked into the room I couldn't hardly see
There she was moving closer to me
She told me her name before I could speak
Took my hand and then she said these words to me

Tonight, oh
This is the night you'll see the light
(That's what she said me)
Tonight, oh
This is the night you'll see the light

Hey, beautiful girl so lovely tonight
Show me the way show me the light
Music playin', people swayin'
Next thing I knew we started to groove

Dancin' and dancin' moving so free
A feeling of love had come over me
I held her close and knew it was right
What a perfect surprise I had finally seen the light

Tonight, oh
This is the night you'll see the light
(That's what she said me)
Tonight, oh
(This is the night)
This is the night you'll see the light

Tonight, you will finally see the light
(Oh baby)
Tonight, you will finally see the light
(Oh baby)

Tonight, you will finally see the light
(You will see, ohyou will see the light)
Tonight you will finally see the light
(Oh yeah)

Oh, come on, I want to dance with you
(Tonight, oh
(This is the night you'll see the light)
