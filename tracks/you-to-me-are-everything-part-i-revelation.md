We are not so different, you and I
no matter what we think
weâre kicking against the traces, bludgeoning
trying to make it sink

Weâre stepping into the unknown
peeling layers of the onion right down
cuz that is part of my style to
risk to be left with nothing
in pursuit of chasing something
out of hand
I know, I know donât tell me

Iâve been on this earth
I know the moon like a friend
I hear a tune or someone sing
feel the beauty in them
these words woman
we have some children
I got memories with you
I wonder how it ends
itâs beautiful yes
what we have chosen
with love in our hands
we have made this garden
& I think I can ride
although Iâm not a horseman
but I have a patient mind
& itâs open

We donât want to walk into the gray
solo rolling with no map in hand
so we reach out for someone to grasp
keep from sinking into the sand

Pick it up now brother help another pick it up
donât get stuck in the destruction looming near
pick it up now brother help another pick it up
this is the revelation of the year

Picking up all the pieces here and there
to see if one might fit
spinning them around and sideways and up and down
it kinda stings a bit

Digging through all the ditches just unwinding all the stitches into thread
then hang it out to dry so
what was I expecting just collecting balls of lint up in my head?
I know I know donât yell at me

I know youâre tired of the same routine
you have that look on your face
I think I know what it means
out of sorts in a vast machine
a worker bee up in the scene
never will be the queen
& yes sometimes you have to sting
expose the schemes to unlock the dreams
ignite quicker than the gasoline
to mask everything again in a smokescreen

We donât want to walk into the gray
solo rolling with no map in hand
so we reach out for someone to grasp
keep from sinking into the sand
