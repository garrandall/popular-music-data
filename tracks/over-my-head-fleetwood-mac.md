You can take me to paradise,
And then again you can be cold as ice
I'm over my head,
But it sure feels nice.
You can take me anytime you like,
I'll be around if you think you might love me baby,
And hold me tight.
Your mood is like a circus wheel,
You're changing all the time,
Sometimes I can't help but feel,
That I'm wasting all of my time.
Think I'm looking on the dark side,
But everyday you hurt my pride,
I'm over my head,
But it sure feels nice,
I'm over my head,
But it sure feels nice.
