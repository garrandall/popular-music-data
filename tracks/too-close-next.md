I wonder if she could tell I'm hard right now
Yeah, come on, dance for me, baby, yeah
You feel that? All right, come on, don't stop now
You done did it, come on, yeah, all right, hold on


Baby, when we're grindin', I get so excited
Ooh how I like it, I try but I can't fight it
Oh, you're dancin' real close, 'plus it's real, real slow
You're makin' it hard for me


Oh the songs on you requested
You're dancin' like you're naked
It's almost like we're sexin' (oh yeah)
Yeah, boo, I like it, no, I can't deny it
But I know you can tell I'm excited, oh girl


(Step back, you're dancin' kinda close)
(I feel a little poke comin' through on you)
Now girl, I know you felt it
But boo, you know, I can't help it
You know what I wanna do


Baby, when we're grindin', I get so excited
Ooh how I like it, I try but I can't fight it
Oh, you're dancin' real close, 'plus it's real, real slow
You know you're makin' it hard for me


Baby, us dancin' so close ain't a good idea
'Cause I'ma want you now and here
The way that you shake it on me
Makes me want you so bad sexually, oh girl


(Step back, you're dancin' kinda close)
(I feel a little poke comin' through on you)
Now girl, I know you felt it
But boo, you know, I can't help it
You know what I wanna do, oh yes


Baby, when we're grindin', I get so excited
Ooh how I like it, I try but I can't fight it
Oh, you're dancin' real close, 'plus it's real, real slow
You know you're makin' it hard for me
Baby, don't stop
Baby, when we're grindin', I get so excited
Ooh how I like it, I try but I can't fight it
Oh, you're dancin' real close, 'plus it's real, real slow
You're makin' it hard for me


I love when you shake it like that
(I see that you like it like that)
I love when you shake it like that

Baby, I like it


Baby, when we're grindin', I get so excited
Ooh how I like it, I try but I can't fight it
Oh, you're dancin' real close, 'plus it's real, real slow
You're makin' it hard for me


I like the way you move
(Baby, when we're grindin' I get so excited)
You're making me want you oh the way you move
('Plus it's real, real slow)
I like those things you do cause you're a little too close, yeah
I get so excited, ooh, how I like it, I try but I can't fight it
Oh, you're dancin' real close, 'plus it's real, real slow
You're makin' it hard for me
