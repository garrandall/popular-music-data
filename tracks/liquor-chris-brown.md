There's something in this liquor, the air is getting thicker
I can't help but to stare at you, oh yeah, girl what did you do to me?
What did you slip up in my cup, girl? Cause I want you, oh yeah
I had a little bit too much girl, so come over here


There's something in this liquor, oh yeah
The air is getting thicker
All I want is you-ou-ou-ou
All I want is you-ou-ou-ou


There's something in this liquor girl, I'm looking at your figure woah
I just want to see you strip right now, baby let me help you work it out, oh
Girl you look so good, I just wanna get right to it, oh
I could beat it up like-like a real nigga should, baby when we do it, woah


There's something in this liquor, oh yeah
The air is getting thicker
All I want is you-ou-ou-ou
All I want is you-ou-ou-ou


All I wanna do is drink and fuck, drink, drink and fuck
All I wanna do is drink and fuck, and fuck, and fuck
All I want is you-ou-ou-ou, drink and fuck, drink, drink and fuck
Drink and fuck, and fuck, and fuck


There's something in this liquor, there's something in this liquor girl
The air is getting thicker, the air is getting thicker
I can't help but stare at you, oh, yeah, girl what did you do? (Why?)
What did you slip up in my cup girl? Cause I want some
I had a little bit too much girl, so come over here, woah


All I wanna do is drink and fuck, drink, drink and fuck
Drink and fuck, and fuck, and fuck
Drink and fuck, drink, drink and fuck
Drink and fuck, and fuck, and fuck


All I wanna do is drink and, drink, drink and
Drink and, and, and
Drink and, drink, drink and
Drink and, and, and
