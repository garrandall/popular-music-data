Hey D.J. Just play that song
Keep me dancing all night long
Hey D.J. Just play that song
Keep me dancing all night long
Hey D.J. Just play that song
Keep me dancing all night long
Hey D.J. Just play that song
Keep me dancing all night long


Now what you hear is not a test
It's from ol' school to new school coming back with a twist
It's the Lighter Shade bringing back the funky rhythm
Time to show 'em what I give 'em
Show 'em how I use to live 'em
Back in the days before Hip Hop departed
No more dicso fever John Travolta finished what he started
Walking down the street with your ghetto blaster bumping
And thumping break beat always urge to rap something
Nowadays you got a new type of flavor
A certain rap behavior Lighter Shade returns the favor
I'm giving props to all D.J.'s
That play the ol' funk you know how we play
And as the MC let the freestyle funk flow
Every once in a while they make the crowd scream, "Ho"
Jumping around wasn't the thing they did
Steady bopping their head while the girls had said

Can I get a dang dang
A ringa dang digga digga digga dang dang
A ringa dang digga digga
As I swing to the old school, funk
94 bump pop it in your trunk
And lay back and relax for a while
As I kick It to this smooth, dope style
And commence to a get you in the mood
Move to tha groove cause ya now your gonna do it
And checka, checka, checka, check it out (Check it out)
Step right up and see what the Shade is all about
Who the flavor, I'm the flavor
And I came here just to save you
With a bit of the same old that you heard
Huh, now can I get a word
As I'm goin', goin',  gone
Hey D.J., come on and play me that funky song

Now I remember around the way back
Back in the day I use to know
A DJ who could mix it wicked it
Pick it up, pick it up, like check one two
Only now there's just more than a few rappers
MC's, who boast and they brag
A bag full of hits cause the Shade will never lag
As I rip it, I wreck it, so check it
Yo, D, bust a fat rhyme for the fat record
Hippity hop what it's the loco
Peep the game to the PG and the vocals
As I reminisce over this and that yo oh
Where we gonna take 'em (Way back)
Like I said before and I'll say it again
It's the old school versatile flex when we band
Eel skill that we got, you know we got mad props
So play me that funky song
