Say man, let's split (who's driving?)
Not me (well not me)
What'd ya mean not you?

(Chorus)
I need some gas money
I need some gas money
Well if you really want to go
You'll have to come up with some dough
I need some gas money

Well if I'm in your car
No matter where or how we are
You try to get my cash
'Cause you say you're out of gas
So just stay just where we are

(Chorus)

I need some gas money

Well I done run out of bread
And that's the only thing I dread
I don't got any money
'Cause I spent it on my honey
So I'm going home to bed

(Chorus)

I need some gas money

Well if I'm in your car
No matter where or how we are
Oh you try to get my cash
'Cause you say you're out of gas
So just stay just where we are

(Chorus)

Well if you really want to go
You'll have to come up with some dough
I need some gas money
