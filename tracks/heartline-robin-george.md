Your crazy attitude is spoiling everyone's fun
All you wanna do is take the money and run
All I ever get from you is desert and sun
It's much too late to change your mind, the damage is done

I've tried to see your point of view but baby, come on
The situation's vacant, now the season has gone
All I want to know is why it took you so long
It's much too late to change the tune, I don't like this song

Heartline
You get your number changed
Bad sign
'Coz I won't be callin' again

Hard time
Your mind is always engaged
Good bye
Heart's on the line
Heart's on the line

I'm through with making music on a telephone line
I'll pay the bill, you keep the change, show me where to sign
All you ever gave me was a hell of a time
It's much too late to change your words, it still won't apply

Heartline
You get your number changed
Bad sign
'Coz I won't be callin' again

Hard time
Your mind is always engaged
Good bye
Heart's on the line
Heart's on the line

Heartline
You get your number changed
Bad sign
'Coz I won't be callin' again

Hard time
Your mind is always engaged
Good bye
Heart's on the line

Heartline
You get your number changed
Bad sign
'Coz I won't be callin' again

Hard time
Your mind is always engaged
Good bye
Heart's on the line
Heartline
Heartline
