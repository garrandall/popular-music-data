At the top of the stairs, there's darkness
My life is not based on unhappiness,
Just a life unwanted
My life has been sadly taunted,
I fear the sight of darkness,
'Cause I can see you in the shadow of happiness.

Just a life on the border,
My love has been taken from that order,
My life has been arranged with sorrow,
My life is cloudy today and tomorrow;
When I had love, it was nice,
How could I base my entire life?

At the top of the stairs, there's darkness,
My life is not based on happiness,
My life has been sadly taunted,
Now I fear the sight of darkness,
Now I fear the shadow of loneliness.
