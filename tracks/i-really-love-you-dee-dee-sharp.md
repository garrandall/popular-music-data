(I really love you)
(Baby baby yes I do)
(I really love you)
(Baby baby yes I do)

I can't get used to
Not having you to
Take me out on a late
Sugar, sugar, would ya would ya
Tell me where I made my mistake
Because

(I really love you)
Yes I do

(Baby baby yes I do)

AinÂ´t no use denying
I'm doin a lot of crying
Over you
Sweetie, sweetie, tell me tell me
Where did I go wrong
Because...

(I really love you)
Yes I do

(Baby baby yes I do)
(I really love you)

Baby baby
Oh yes I do

(Baby baby yes I do)

I really miss you
Since you been gone
We had a love
Oh so strong
Why won't you come on back?
Why won't you come on back?
Come on back?
Where you belong
Because...
