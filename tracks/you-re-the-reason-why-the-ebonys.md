Ba ba ba ba... yeah

Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

Just because of you (ooh, yeah)
I'm a happy guy
You're the reason why
Just because of you
I'm a happy guy
You're the reason why

I feel like a king
Sitting high on top of the world
If my heart could sing
I'd sing a love song to you, girl

You are my reason
To feel this way
And every time I see you
I just wanna say

Just because of you (ooh, yeah)
I'm a happy guy
You're the reason why
Just because of you
I'm a happy guy
You're the reason why

Feel like a tot
That found a brand new toy
All the love that you bring
You fill my heart with so much joy

You are my reason
That I feel this way
And I hope and I pray
You'll never take your love away

Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

Just because of you (oh, yeah)
I'm a happy guy
You're the reason why
(You make me feel so brand new)

Ba ba ba ba... yeah

Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

Just because of you (that's why)
I'm a happy guy
You're the reason why
(You make me feel so brand new)

Just because of you (that's why)
I'm a happy guy
(I just got to, got to love you)
You're the reason why, yeah

Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

Just because of you (ooh, yeah)
I'm a happy guy (come on)
You're the reason why
Just because of you...
