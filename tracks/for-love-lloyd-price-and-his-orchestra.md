(For love)
Honey may I change your name
(For love)
I know I'll be a happy man
(For love)
Losing you would be a shame
(For love)
I'm sewn to you, ball and chain.

For love, for love, for love, your love
For love, for love, for love

(For love)
Maybe we could settle down
(For love)
In some little country town
(For love)
I'd buy myself a rockin' chair
(For love)
And maybe we'll be happy there

For love, for love, for love, your love
For love, for love, for love

(Music interlude)

For love, for love, for love, your love
For love, for love, for love

(For love)
Honey may I change your name
(For love)
I know I'll be a happy man
(For love)
Losing you would be a shame
(For love)
I'm sewed to you, ball and chain.

For love, for love, for love, your love
For love, for love, for your love
