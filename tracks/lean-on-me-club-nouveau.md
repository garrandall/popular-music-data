Sometimes in our lives
We all have pain
We all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that there's always tomorrow

Lean on me
When you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
(I'll be your friend)

I'll help you carry on
(Lean on me)
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on


Please swallow your pride
If I have things you need to borrow
For no one can fill
Those of your needs
That you won't let show




So just call on me brother
When you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem
That you'd understand
We all need somebody to lean on


Lean on me
When you're not strong
(When you're not strong)
And I'll be your friend
(I'll be your friend)

I'll help you carry on
(Lean on me)
For said
It won't be long (Won't be too long)
'Til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on

We be jamming
We be jamming (Hey, now)
We be jamming

We be jamming
We be jamming

We be jamming
We be jamming (hey)

We be jamming

(Just call me)
Uh, when you need a friend
(Call me)
Oh, baby
Now
(Call me)
Uh, when you need a friend

(Call me)
Oh, baby now
(Call me)
Uh, when you need a friend
(Call me)
Oh, baby
Now
