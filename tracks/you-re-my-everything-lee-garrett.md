I'm singing about, I love you girl
I'm singing about

Sometimes, when late at night when I wake up
And I find you there
I thank god 'cause he answered all of my prayers
Hey there's plenty of sunshine
To follow the rain
I know when you're mine, baby
Why should we complain

(You're everything)
(You're my everything)
(Baby)

You're so fine, glad you're mine
My baby, baby

You said I am the brightest and
All of your
Honey, I said thanks for the lifeliness
And love so many ways

Plenty of sunshine
To follow the rain
I know when you're mine, baby
Why should we complain

(You're everything)
(You're my everything)
(Baby)

My baby
Yes you're my...
Glad your mine, sweet baby, baby

Ohhh, girl girl girl
Such a
Ohh baby, my baby
And I'm glad you're my baby
My baby, my baby
You're...
I said you're...
My baby, baby
Oh baby baby baby baby
I love you little girl
