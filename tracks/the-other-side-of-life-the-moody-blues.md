The atmosphere on the streets tonight
Is the driving beat of the world
The word down here on the streets tonight
Is the truest music you've heard

So take your share of the gifts that are there
They all belong to you
And come what may at the break of each day
We all begin anew once more, we all begin anew

Baby, baby, baby, let's investigate
The other side of life tonight
The lovers and the fighters and the risks they take
Are on the other side of life tonight

Let's lose our way, go completely astray
And find ourselves again
You know the only way to get there is to take that step
To the other side of life tonight

The atmosphere on the streets tonight
Is the driving beat of the world
The word down here on the streets tonight
Is the truest music you've heard

So take your share of the gifts that are there
They all belong to you
And come what may at the break of each day
We all begin anew once more, we all begin anew

Baby, baby, baby, let's investigate
The other side of life tonight
The lovers and the fighters and the risks they take
Are on the other side of life tonight

Let's lose our way, go completely astray
And find ourselves again
You know the only way to get there is to take that step
To the other side of life tonight

Let's lose our way, go completely astray
And find ourselves again
You know the only way to get there is to take that step
To the other side of life tonight
