But, baby, baby
Don't let them tell you
I'm too young
Such a pretty baby

So young, my teenage love
So young, my darling (oh, baby)
Oh, how I desire your lips warm as fire
And the thrill when you're near me
(Fire, baby)

As our love may grow
It will hurt me, I know
For our love can never be (oh)

Sweetheart, I want you so bad
This love is driving me mad
But what can I do

So young, too young
That's what they tell me (oh, baby)
Oh, I know that I'll cry
And I know that I'll die
When they take you away from me
(Such a pretty baby)

I'm feeling so blue
For I know that it's true
I can never have you

Sweetheart, I want you so bad
This love is driving me mad
But what can I do

So young, too young
That's what they tell me (oh, baby)
Oh, I know that I'll cry
And I know that I'll die
When they take you away from me
(Such a pretty baby)

I'm feeling so blue
For I know that it's true
I can never have you (oh, baby)
