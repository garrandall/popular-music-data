This for the step-daddies here


Do the Stepdaddy, do the Stepdaddy...

Hey!


Game comin' on tonight!
Say--y'all gon' be quiet tonight!
Play--you'll get whipped tonight!
I say--betta catch a grip tonight!
Lil' boy! Put your little sister down!
Lil' boy! Think I'm playin' around!?
I'll pull my belt, walk these steps
Stepdaddy'll make you beg for help
Now I'mma watch this game...Lord knows
You stay in the house no outdoors

 You ain't my daddy!
 What you say?

 You ain't my daddy!
 What I thought you say!

Now all you lil' mothas go to bed
And tell ya lil' brothas to go to bed



 You ain't my daddy!
 SHUT UP!
 You ain't my daddy!
 SHUT UP!
 You ain't my daddy!
 SHUT UP!
 You ain't my daddy!
 SHUT UP!

 I'mma call yo mama!
 Call my mama!
 I'mma tell yo mama!
 Tell my mama!
 You so bad!
 I'm so bad! You just mad cause you ain't my dad!

 I'mma call yo mama!
 Call my mama!
 I'mma tell yo mama!
 Tell my mama!


Two in da mornin' (What?) call it a night (What?)
Take me a nap, wait for the wife
Who is that?! Better be sleepwalkin!

 B not here?
 Better be sleeptalkin!

Who the hell is that in the refrigerator?

 We hungry!
 Kids don't eat 'til later


At two in the mornin, kids be sleep
It's two in the mornin, go back to sleep!
Now me and my baby won't get to creep
Bebe and her kids gettin' the best of me



 This ain't yo house no way!
 Shut Up!
 You ain't my dad!
 Okay, that's enough..
 I wish my dad wouldn've never left!
 What?!
 I wish we lived here by ourself!
 What?!


Wash these dishes, take this trash out
Do my homework (I'ma stepdaddy girl) then I pass out (a stepdaddy!)
Stepdad ain't been there for me!

 Don't talk back! Bet' not embarrass me!
 You don't take none of us to the movies!
 Shut Up!
 You don't take none of us to the zoo!
 Shut Up!
 Every time we talk to you...
 "Shut Up..."
 Ain't nobody even talkin' to you!
(tell her again)
 "Shut Up!"


Hey! Hey! Ya'll get ready to take ya bath, get ready to go to bed
Put them UNO cards up, ain't no--ain't no "Itsy Bitsy Spider" tonight
Run yo water, put yo sister down you think I'm playin?!

 The Itsy Bitsy Spider went up the water spout!
 Shut Up!
 Down came the rain and washed the spider out!
 Go to bed!
 Out came the sun and dried up all the rain!
 Shut Up!
 And the Itsy Bitsy Spider went up the spout again!
 Go to bed!
