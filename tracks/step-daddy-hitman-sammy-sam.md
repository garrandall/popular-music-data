Tay-Tay, KeKe, Red, and Mike-Mike
Somebody betta tell me why I hear ya outside
Got a call from ya step daddy  was tha issua
You betta stop talkin or ima start whippin


He aint my daddy
Always fussin
Makin us clean up and he aint did nuthin
Ima tell mama what ya did anyway
He left us in the house by ourself all day


What? Where the hell he at


Girl Stop


Boy you gone make me snap


Girl Stop


You left my kids home alone


Uh huh


You been callin girls on my phone


Uh huh


Boy you betta start answerin me


They lyin


Or you gone find yaself out on tha street


Put em out mama


Shut up


Put em out mama


Shut up


Naw shut yo mouth
Tryin to handle my kids
Need to take care of yours
When the last time you went to pay some child supports
You aint took out no trash and cut no grass
You went out last night and aint was yo ass
Did you give my children sumn to eat?


Sho' didn't


But you had time to creep thru the streets


Sho' did


I tell you wat you got two minutes to get out mah face
Between you and DFEX ima catch me a case
4reel


You aint my daddy anyway


Shut yo mouth, shut up


You aint my daddy anyway


Im leavin this house cause im fed up


I wish yo neva met my mama


I wish I neva met yo mama


I wish it was just me and my mama


I wish it was just you and yo mama


You aint my daddy anyway


Shut yo mouth, shut up


Im leavin this house cause im fed up
After all I did you beleavin them
Ill tell you wat baby im leavin her
They talk back to me girl anyway
They bad no matta what ya mama say
Can't go no where wit me


Don't want to


Can't go to the fair with me


Don't want to


They all talk back to me

I told you now ya see


Shold do


Step daddy
