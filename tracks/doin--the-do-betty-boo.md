(Oh, ah, ohah
Oh, ah, ohah)

It's me again, yes, how did you guess?
'Cause last time you were really impressed
And I'm bolder, c-c-cold, gettin' colder
And at the very same time I heat up at the party

And solder but not with solar power
For far too long made mistakes
And allowed a fat and ugly thing get in my way

Now I'm suitable and MC, I'm no inbetween
Top of the rank like Pearl and Dean
And if you can't take the heat get out the kitchen
Ain't got no time for your boo-boo-be

Betty Boo, Betty Boo just doin' the do
And you are through and there's nothing you can do
Betty Boo, Betty Boo just doin' the do
And you are through and there's nothing you can do

Hoodlum, that what you called me
Rebellious, you can't ignore me
But never mind, 'cause I know that I'm sweeter
Your time is up so put more money in your meter

You say I bully though I know I'm no goody-goody
But what do I know is that I'm fully in control
You're on a roll, fat as a rolypoly and on the whole

You think that I'm a threat
'Cause I'm the best you could ever get
I never make the teachers' pet
And ease yourself, I know you despise me
You criticize and override me

But I'm better and a whole lot cleverer
A go-getter, you know, a trend setter
I'm all the rage and all the craze
Come on, change the record, gotta turn the page

Betty Boo, Betty Boo just doin' the do
And you are through and there's nothing you can do
Betty Boo, Betty Boo just doin' the do
And you are through and there's nothing you can do

I'm sorry if I upset ya
To get the better of me I wouldn't let ya
Any time of the day I could get ya
You come runnin' to me, yes, I bet ya

Ain't goin' out like a sucker
There's no need to huff and puffa
'Cause, baby, I am tougher than you think
So you just gotta suffer

Betty Boo, Betty Boo just doin' the do
And you are through and there's nothing you can do
Betty Boo, Betty Boo just doin' the do
And you are through and there's nothing you can do

You might play bold but Betty Boo is bolder
Cold gettin' dumb, cold gettin' colder
Spent half the time lookin' over your shoulder
There ain't another MC who could be the queen

You have never been considered as anyone hype
So tonight I'm gonna take time out
To wipe that smile off your face
You're a side effect like an aftertaste

So face the facts, I do the job well
And hell, why not, I got a lot so tell me
What you're sayin', I'm not playin'
Somebody's gotta go and I'm stayin', Jack

Get back, exactly, you got me right
Get up, get with it or get outta my sight
Because I'm hot and sizzly, put you in the mood
Someone like you puts me off my food

Betty Boo, Betty Boo just doin' the do
And you are through and there's nothing you can do
Betty Boo, Betty Boo just doin' the do
And you are through and there's nothing you can do

Betty Boo, Betty Boo just doin' the do
And you are through and there's nothing you can do
Betty Boo, Betty Boo just doin' the do
And you are through and there's nothing you can do
