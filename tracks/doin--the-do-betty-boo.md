Ohh Ohh Ohhh Ohh Ohh Ohh Noo
Good lord have mercy I'm happy to see you
The last time I've seen you must've been high school
How we lost in touch
Girl right now don't matter much cause we got unfinished busniness that we gotta discuss
First and for most shawty you still got it lookin' cute
That's why I gave you your nickname betty boo
Back to the subject
Girl remember where we left
You tellin' me gimme somethin that I won't forget
Yes
Started out from just watch and play
Then one day made our own movie
Oh I
Still holding on to that one time
You know that was a tease
So now that were both grown and sexy
And it ain't like couldn't say you just met me
I'm thinking why not catch up with your people
Get ready get ready
Girl it's time to make a sequel
Time we make a sequel
Time we make a sequel
Let me be your pornstar
You can take the lead roll
Love I've been waiting, stay in tune for the part two
Camera started roll
Time we make a sequel
Time we make a sequel
Girl you know you wanted to
Everything I didn't do
I'm a make it up to you
Rip up the script
Girl get busy cause there's no rules
Camera started roll
Time we make a sequel
Wanna be your trainer
Work your body ody ody
All day all night baby we'll doin big (something)
Know how to just get you numb
Ever had a orgasm
Whispering all the things you wanna hear (something)
Have you do them tricks
Like you were into gymnastics
Can't help it
Can't help it
My lovin's fantastic
Baby we just begun
No were near my final stunt
No doubt about it
Your gonna label me your best
Yes!
Started out from just watch and play
Then one day made our own movie
Oh I
Still holding on to that one time
You know that was a tease
So now that were both grown and sexy
And it ain't like couldn't say you just met me
I'm thinking why not catch up with your people
Get ready get ready
Girl it's time to make a sequel
Time we make a sequel
Time we make a sequel
Let me be your pornstar
You can take the lead roll
Love I've been waiting, stay in tune for the part two
Camera started roll
Time we make a sequel
Time we make a sequel
Girl you know you wanted to
Everything I didn't do
I'm a make it up to you
Rip up the script
Girl get busy cause there's no rules
Camera started roll
Time we make a sequel
Scene 1
Searching for my keys as were kissing under sun
Slam the door as baby we begin this marathon
Start right here on the floor
And then I pick you up
Change rolls
Gotta nominate you
Scene 2
Best part is coming
This is were you gon' end
You deserve an Oscar for your performance
I'm a give you your award
Now how about we make this official
Cause' I'm ready to make a sequel
Time we make a sequel
Time we make a sequel
Let me be your pornstar
You can take the lead roll
Love I've been waiting, stay in tune for the part two
Camera started roll
Time we make a sequel
Time we make a sequel
Girl you know you wanted to
Everything I didn't do
I'm a make it up to you
Rip up the script
Girl get busy cause there's no rules
Camera started roll
Time we make a sequel
