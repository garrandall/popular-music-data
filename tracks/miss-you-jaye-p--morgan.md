I miss you
Since you went away, dear
Miss you
More than I can say, dear
Daytime, nightime
Nothing I do can make me forget
That I still love you

Wondering
Why we had to break up
Wondering
If we'll ever make up
Wondering
If you ever miss me
As I miss you

I keep wondering
If you ever miss me
As I miss you
