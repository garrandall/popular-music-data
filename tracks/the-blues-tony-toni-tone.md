You know what fellas? What?
I wanna get this beat. Pull out them drums loud
I wanna hear them kickin'
Kick it so loud they kick 'em way back in Mississippi
Like that? Aw, yeah, like that
All you ever give me is the blues
C' mon fellas, let's do this

Spendin' all my time trying to show how I feel when there is so much I can do
Oh, I wanna please you. (Yeah.)
You say you care for me, but you don't act that way
C'mon, girl, who you trying to fool
Tell, Dwayne
Just when I try to fill you what I can do for you
I feel like I'm wasting my time
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I can't see myself without you
That's why I hang around
All you ever give me is the blues

Girl, you know I'm spending all my time pleasing you
All you ever give me is the blues
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Spending all my time pleasing you
All you ever give me is the blues
Oh, I wanna please you

Every time I see you, girl (Why?)
All I wanna know is how I may get next to you
Oh, I wanna please you
There's got to be a way
I'm thinking every day
C'mon, girl, please give me a clue
Tell, Dwayne

Just because he drives a Porsche (Yeah) and I just drive a note
But what about the man inside
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, if that is what you're into
Why don't you let me know instead of always giving me the blues

Girl, 'cause you know I'm spending all my time pleasing you
All you ever give me is the blues
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Spending all my time pleasing you
All you ever give me is the blues
Oh, I wanna please you
C'mon, y'all
Clap your hands
Everybody clap your hands
Oh, I wanna please you
Boys, help me out
Oh, I wanna

Blues. Blues. Blues. Blues
Blues. Blues. Blues. Blues

Spending all my time pleasing you
I've always been true
Why you wanna give me the blues
Spending all my time pleasing you
All you ever give me is the blues
You're always on my mind all the time
(Spending all my time pleasing you)
Every day, every night
(All you ever give me is the blues)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Spending all my time pleasing you
All you ever give me is the blues
I tried 20 times (Spending all my time pleasing you)
And you never cross my mind
(All you ever give me is the blues)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Spending all my time pleasing you)
For my money worked, what can I do for you
All you ever give me is the blues
