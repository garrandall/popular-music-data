No matter what you are
I will always be with you
Doesn't matter what you do, girl
Oh girl, with you


No matter what you do
I will always be around
Won't you tell me what you found, girl
Oh girl, won't you?


Knock down the old grey wall
Be a part of it all
Nothing to say, nothing to see, nothing to do
If you would give me all
As I would give it to you
Nothing would be, nothing would be, nothing would be


No matter where you go
There will always be a place
Can't you see it in my face, girl?
Oh girl, want you




Knock down the old grey wall
Be a part of it all
Nothing to say, nothing to see, nothing to do
If you would give me all
As I would give it to you
Nothing would be, nothing would be, nothing would be


No matter what you are
I will always be with you
Doesn't matter what you do, girl
Oh girl, with you
Oh girl, you girl, want you
Oh girl, you girl, want you
