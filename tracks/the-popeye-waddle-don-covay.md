(Can you do the Popeye)
I'm trying that now
(Can you do the Popeye)
Well, show me how
(Can you do the Popeye)
You'll do fine if you get in line

(Popeye) hey, watch me do it
(Popeye) there's nothing to it
(Popeye, let's do the Popeye all night)

(Can you do the Waddle)
I'm trying that now
(Can you do the Waddle)
Well, show me how, yeah
(Can you do the Waddle)
I can get it, I can get it
You'll do fine if you get in line

(Waddle) oh, watch me try
(Popeye) it's not the? porcupine?
(Popeye, I like the waddle, all right)

Popeye, hey, it's like the waddle
Was the name of the game
Waddle, hey, it's like the Popeye
Every dance is the same

You hit it, get it
Make it, shake it

Popeye, waddle with the wobble
Was the name of the game

(Can you do the wiggle)
I'm a swinging cat
(Can you do the waddle)
I like it like that
(Can you wiggle waddle)
I can make it if you shake it
You'll do fine if you get in line

(Come on and wiggle)
Hey, it's like the waddle
(Waddle) hey, it's like wobble
(Let's do the dances all night)

Popeye, hey, it's like the waddle
Was the name of the game
Waddle, hey, it's like the Popeye
Every dance is the same

You hit it, get it
Make it, shake it
Popeye, waddle with the wobble
Was the name of the game

All together, do the
Popeye, waddle with the wobble
Was the name of the game
One more time now
Popeye, waddle with the wobble
I love em just the same
