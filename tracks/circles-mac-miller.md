Well, this is what it look like
Right before you fall
Stumbling around, you been guessing your direction
Next step, you can't see at all

And I don't have a name, I don't have name, no
Who am I to blame? Who am I to blame though?
And I cannot be changed, I cannot be changed, no
Trust me I've tried, I just end up right at the start of the line
Drawing circles

Well I drink my whiskey, and you sip your wine
We're doing well, sitting, watching the world falling down, its decline
And I can keep you safe, I can keep you safe
Do not be afraid, do not be afraid

You're feeling sorry, I'm feeling fine
Don't you put any more stress on yourself, it's one day at a time
It's getting pretty late, getting pretty late
Yeah, and I find it goes around like the hands that keep counting the time
Drawing circles
