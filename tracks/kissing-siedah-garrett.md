Oh la la
Oh, baby, baby
Don't you know I live for your touch
Oh, baby, baby
Only you can give me what I want (just what I want)
Yes
Oh, baby, baby
Why don't we just test the waters
Oh, baby, baby
Put your lips next to mine then we'll take a step above


Begins with love
That's where it's going
I want you, you want me
This kind of thing can lead
To the birds and the bees
High in the breeze
Boys and girls
Names on trees
All starts with the K I S S, K I S S I N G

Oh, why don't we get together
Don't you know all we ever need
One thing leads straight to another
First things first, second we'll see



I like it, you know
K I S S I N G

Oh, baby, baby
Why don't we just test the waters
Oh, baby, baby
Put your lips next to mine then we'll take a step above
And we'll work it overtime
