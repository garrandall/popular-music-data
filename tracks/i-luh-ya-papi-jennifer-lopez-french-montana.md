I put it down for a brother like you
Give it to you right in the car, that's you
We can first give you some of this, that's you
And you're all out loving that JLove true

Hold up, I can get you fun up
Pull your trigger, go and get your gun up
I'mmatie my hair up top
Put a pin in it, now I'm ready, let it rock
Keep it number 1, that's easy mathematics
Keep it number 1, baby, ain't no static
Got that hourglass for you, baby, look at these legs
No brakes, go green, no red
If you wanna kill the body, gotta start with the head
Put it on you, I'm a need about 4-5 beds
Cause I love my papi

I didn't see it, but I see it now
Think I love you, and I need you know
Ain't had none like you in a while

I luh ya papi, I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
Yeah, that my papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi

I put it down for a brother like you
Give it to you right in the car, that's you
We can first give you some of this, that's you
And you're all out loving that JLove true

All day, 24 hour
Feeling like I want one when it's crowded
If you wanna hear your name, I shout it
Boy, you the shit, go and take a power shower
And I'm feeling like it's me and you, I don't doubt it
You can drive it how you want, I ain't trying to count mileage
I'm loving me some you
Started from the bottom, baby, then we went roof
Cause I love my papi

I didn't see it, but I see it now
Think I love you, and I need you know
Ain't had none like you in a while

I luh ya papi, I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
Yeah, that my papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi


I love you, mami, l-l love you, mami
Baby, you the shit, l-l love you, mami
Shorty got me catching feelings
And that rave drop reaching for the ceiling
Southside Bronx, Teterboro just overseas
Take the pants out here, drop to her knees
Oh my, I'm a don like Omar
Speed it up slow ma, throw it back, toma
Rock-rock Gators like my detroit players
You can hate to love us, you can love to hate us
From the bottom it been real
From the bottom shorty been trill
And even though we made it to the top
Still J.Lo from the-the the block
Ey, I love you, mami, I love you, mami
Baby, you the shit, l-l love you, mami

I think I love just who you are
We haven't grown apart, this is just the start
Where life begin all the way to the end
And we started as friends, boy I do love

I luh ya papi, I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
Yeah, that my papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
