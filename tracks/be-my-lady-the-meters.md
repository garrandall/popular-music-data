Would you be my lady for the lifetime?
With this is a song I want to fill the air
Givin' you all my understanding
Sweet tender loving care

Be my lady
Drive me crazy
Be my sweetness, my completeness
Be my lover there is no other

You are the song of loving me
Sugar sweet is in your smile
Countin you in all my blessings
Holding you straight for just a while
