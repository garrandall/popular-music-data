There's an army on the dance floor
Fashion with a gun, my love
In a room without a door
A kiss is not enough in

Love my way, it's a new road
I follow where my mind goes

They put us on a railroad
And dearly make us pay
For laughing in their faces
And making it our way
There's emptiness behind their eyes
Dust in all their hearts
They just want to steal us all and tear us all apart, but

Love my way, it's a new road
I follow where my mind goes
Love my way, it's a new road
I follow where my mind goes

Swallow all your tears, my love
And put on your new face
You can never win or lose
If you don't run the race
If you don't run the race

Love my way, it's a new road
I follow where my mind goes
Love my way, it's a new road
I follow where my mind goes
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Love my way, it's a new road (Ah, ah)
I follow where my mind goes (Ah, ah)
Love my way, it's a new road (Ah, ah)
I follow where my mind goes (Ah)
