There's an army on the dance floor
It's a fashion with a gun, my love
In a room without a door
A kiss is not enough in

Love my way, it's a new road
I follow where my mind goes

They'd put us on a railroad
They'd dearly make us pay
For laughing in their faces and making it our way
There's emptiness behind their eyes
There's dust in all their hearts
They just want to steal us all and take us all apart
But not in

Love my way, it's a new road
I follow where my mind goes
Love my way, it's a new road
I follow where my mind goes

Love my way, it's a new road
I follow where my mind goes

So swallow all your tears, my love
And put on your new face
You can never win or lose
If you don't run the race

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw oh, Aw oh, Aw oh
Aaaaaa, Aaaaaa, Aaaaaa, Aaaaaaa
