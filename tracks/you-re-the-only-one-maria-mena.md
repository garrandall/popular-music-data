Well I saw you with your hands above your head
Spinning around, trying not to look down
But you did, and you fell hard on the ground
Then you stumbled around for a good ten minutes
And I said "I'd never seen anyone look so dumb before"
And you laughed and said "I still know how to turn you on though"


You're the only one who
Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams
You're the only one who
Knows exactly what I mean

And I probably forgot to tell you this
Like that time when I forgot to tell you about the scar
Remember how uncomfortable that made you feel?
See you're not what I expected
But you're the only one who knows how to handle me
And you're such a great kisser and I know that you agree



I hope you can forgive me for that time
When I put my hand between your legs
And said it was small
Cuz its really not at all
I guess there's just a part of me that likes to bring you down
Just to keep you around
Cuz the day that you realize how amazing you are
You're gonna leave me

You're the only one who
Holds my hair back when I'm drunk and get sick
You're the only one who
Knows exactly what I mean



Exactly what I mean

Well I saw you with your hands above your head
Spinning around, trying not to look down
But you did, and you fell hard on the ground
