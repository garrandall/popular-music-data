Just smile for me
And let the day begin
You are the sunshine
That lights my heart within

And I'm sure that
You're an angel in disguise
Come take my hand and
Together we will rise


On the wings of love
Up and above the clouds
The only way to fly
Is on the wings of love

On the wings of love
Only the two of us
Together flying high
Flying high up on the wings of love


You look at me
And I begin to melt
Just like the snow when
A ray of sun is felt

And I'm crazy 'bout cha
Baby, can't you see
I'd be so delighted if
You would come with me


On the wings of love
Up and above the clouds
The only way to fly
Is on the wings of love

On the wings of love
Only the two of us
Together flying high
Flying high up on the wings of love


Yes, you belong to me
I'm yours exclusively
Right now we live
And breathe each other

Inseparable it seems
We're flowing like a stream
Running free traveling
On the wings of love


On the wings of love
Up and above the clouds
The only way to fly
Is on the wings of love

On the wings of love
Only the two of us
Together flying high
Together flying high

On the wings of love
Up and above the clouds
The only way to fly
Is on the wings of love

On the wings of love
Only the two of us
Together flying high
Flying high up on the wings of love
