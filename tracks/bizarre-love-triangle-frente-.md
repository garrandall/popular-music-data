Every time I think of you
I get a shot right through
Into a bolt of blue
It's no problem of mine

But it's a problem I find
Living the life that I can't leave behind
There's no sense in telling me
The wisdom of a fool won't set you free

But that's the way that it goes
And it's what nobody knows
And every day my confusion grows

Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for the final moment
You say the words that I can't say

I feel fine and I feel good
I feel like I never should
Whenever I get this way
I just don't know what to say

Why can't we be ourselves
Like we were yesterday
I'm not sure what this could mean
I don't think you're what you seem

I do admit to myself
That if I hurt someone else
Then I'll never see
Just what we're meant to be

Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for the final moment
You'll say the words that I can't say

Every time I see you falling
I'll get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for the final moment
You'll say the words that I can't say
