Five seven o five
But there's no reply
Five seven o five

Got myself just one more dime
But will the operator hold the line
When my ears keep telling me
There's no reply, no reply
I pick up the telephone
I go crazy when there's no one home
I feel cheated and small when
My number's on the wall of her room
Call me soon

Hey operator
Five seven o five
But there's no reply
Five seven o five
Why do you keep me hanging on the line

I can't believe that there's no one there
Is this a private number love affair
With your phone booth lover
Still waiting on the wire, high wire
I saw the light shine behind your door
I heard the party on the second floor
But you only pretend that you've been
Visiting friends from abroad, tell me more

Hey operator
Five seven o five
But there's no reply
Five seven o five
Why do you keep me hanging on the line
Mysterious people I can't believe what she done to me
It's too late now
It's all over town

Five seven o five
But there's no reply
Five seven o five
Can you hold the line
