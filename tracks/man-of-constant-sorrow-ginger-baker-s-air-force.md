(In constant sorrow all through his days)

I am the man of constant sorrow
I've seen trouble all my days
I bid farewell to ol' Kentucky
The place where I was born and raised

(The place where he was born and raised)

For six long years
I've been in trouble
No pleasure here on Earth I find
For in this world I'm bound to ramble
I have no friends to help me out

(He has no friends to help him out)

Kids fare the well
My old true lover I never expect to see you again
For Im bound to ride that Northen Railroad
Perhaps I'll die upon that train

(Perhaps he'll die upon this train)

You can bury me in Sunny Valley
For many years where I may lay
Then you may learn to love another
While I am sleeping in my grave

(While he is sleeping in his grave)

Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
My face you'll never see no more
But there is one promise that is given
I'll meet you on God's golden shore

(He'll meet you on God's golden shore)
