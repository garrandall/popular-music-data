Mmm, the very first time you kissed me
It was so thrilling
What made it so great was
I knew that your heart was willing

I never thought that I'd give love a try
Then you came a walking by
And gave me my first taste of love

Mmm, the very first time you held me
It was so nice
I finally found this place they call paradise

Oh, I was such a sad and lonely guy
Then you came a walking by
And gave me my first taste of love

Your lips upon my lips
Your arms around my waist
How can I forget that first date

Mmm, so keep your
Head on my shoulder
Stay real close, baby, don't let go

Don't think of tomorrow
Let's live for tonight
Because I love you so

You see that love light
Gleaming in my eye
Swear it's gonna never die
'Cause I've got my first taste of love

You see that love light
Gleaming in my eye
Swear it's never gonna die
'Cause I've got my first taste of love

Swear it's never gonna die
'Cause I've got my first taste of love
Swear it's gonna never die
'Cause I've got my first taste of love
