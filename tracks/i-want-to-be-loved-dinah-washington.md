I wanna be loved with inspirationI wanna be loved starting
TonightInstead of merely holding conversationHold me tightI
Wanna be kissed until I tingleI wanna be kissed starting tonightEmbrace
Until our heartbeats intermingleWrong or rightI feel like acting my
AgeI'm past the stage of merely turtledoving(be careful, be careful
What you do)I'm in no mood to resistAnd I insist the world owes me a
LovingI wanna be thrilled to desperationI wanna be thrilled
Starting tonight(love me, love me, love me)With every kind of wonderful
SensationI wanna be lovedI feel like acting my ageI'm past the
Stage of merely turtledovingI'm in no mood to resistAnd I insist the
World owes me a lovingI wanna be thrilled to desperationI wanna be
Thrilled starting tonightWith every kind of wonderful sensationI wanna
Be loved
