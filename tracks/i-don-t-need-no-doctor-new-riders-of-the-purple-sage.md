I don't need no doctor, 'cause I know what's ailin' me,
I don't need no doctor, 'cause I know what's ailin' me.
Been too long away from my baby, I'm comin' down... with the misery.

I don't need no doctor, 'cause my will to live is gone.
I don't need no doctor, 'cause my will to live is gone.
 baby please... come back home.

Now the doctor said I need rest, but all I need is her carress.
He put me on the critical list, but all I need is her sweet kiss.
He gave me a medicated lotion, it didn't sooth... my emotion.

I don't need no doctor, 'cause my will to live is gone (I don't need no doctor, I don't need no doctor)
I don't need no doctor, 'cause my will to live is gone
 baby please... come back home.
