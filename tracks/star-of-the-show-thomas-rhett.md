Walking down the street, hand in mine
It don't keep them other guys
And their wandering eyes from looking at you
That's alright and that's okay
Who can blame 'em anyway?
You're so pretty, and you ain't even got a clue

Cause everywhere we go girl
You're the star of the show
And everybody's wondering and wanting to know
What's your name?
Who's that girl, with the prettiest smile in the world?
Oh, what gets me the most is you don't even know
That you are, you are, you are
The star of the show
You're the star of the show, yeah, baby

Friday night on the town
We walk in and you draw a crowd
Even the band seems to sing for you
Ease on up, order a drink, barkeep says its all on me
You look at me and laugh
Like you don't know what to do
Baby you're so cute

Cause everywhere we go girl
You're the star of the show
And everybody's wondering and wanting to know
Whats your name?
Who's that girl, with the prettiest smile in the world?
Oh, what gets me the most is you don't even know
That you are, you are, you are
The star of the show, yeah
You're the star of the show, baby, yeah yeah

Even in a ponytail in a pair of jeans you look like a cover
Of a magazine, baby you're the only one who doesn't see

That everywhere we go girl
You're the star of the show
And everybody's wondering and wanting to know
Whats your name?
Who's that girl with the luckiest guy in the world?
Oh, what gets me the most is you don't even know
That you are, you are, you are
You are, you are, you are, baby
You are, you are, you are, you are
The star of the show..

Don't you know, you're the star of the show, baby
