While I'm away from you (oh Baby)
I know it's hard for you (oh Baby)
Because it's hard for me
And the darkest hour, is just before dawn

Each night before you go to bed (oh Baby)
Whisper a little prayer for me. (oh Baby)
And let's tell all the stars above
This is dedicated to the one I love

Life can never be exactly like you want it to be

But I can be satisfied Girl, just knowing that you love me
There's one thing I want you to do, especially for me
Hey that's something everybody needs

While I'm away (oh Baby)
Whisper a little prayer for me. (oh Baby)
And let's tell all the stars above
This is dedicated to the one I love
