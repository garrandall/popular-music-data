The moon was yellow, and the night was young.
A smile brought us together, and I was wond'ring whether
We'd meet again someday.
The moon was yellow, and a song was sung.
That vocal inspiration gave me the inclination
To give my heart away.
Here we are!  Is our romance to continue?
Will it be my luck to win you.
May I look that far?  Ah!  My love is
Ah, my love is yellow and the night is young.
