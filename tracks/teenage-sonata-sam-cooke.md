Here, here in the moonlight
Hold me while I sing to you
My teenage sonata
Of my love
Eternally true
It's written and filled with devotion
From deep in my heart
And with my teenage sonata
Comes a prayer that we'll never part

And as long as we love it will stay
We'll hear it on our wedding day

My lips can only kiss you
They can explain how you make me feel
But my teenage sonata
Will tell you that my love is real
My love is real
My love is real
