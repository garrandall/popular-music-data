I don't need her
Don't need her kind of heartache and pain
She's gonna have to see
Things now can never be the same again

I won't miss her
Well, maybe I'll miss her once in a while
She thinks I'm gonna die
Now that she's said goodbye
But she's so wrong
Her eyes just smile

Baby baby, don't you believe it?
When it comes to your lovin', I can take it or leave it
Baby baby, don't you believe it?
When it comes to your lovin', I can take it or leave it
I can take or leave your lovin'
I can take or leave your lovin'

I'm not sorry
I still think we're better apart
She says she's gonna see
A day when there's gonna be a change of heart

Baby baby, don't you believe it?
When it comes to your lovin', I can take it or leave it
Baby baby, don't you believe it?
When it comes to your lovin', I can take it or leave it
I can take or leave your lovin'
I can take or leave your lovin'
