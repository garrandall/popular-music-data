Well I never been much for admitting things
That's why it's all so hard to say
That I'm head over heels in love with your kind of insanity
And if it please Your Highness on a sunny day sometime
Can I take your picture in the park with silk and satin on?


Star Baby, flashy little shiny little two-timin' mama
Star Baby, shiny little flashy little lovin' machine


I never been much good at keepin' a secret
Now it's easy for me to say
That I'm head over heels shook up
About the way that you fool with me
And if it please Your Highness on a sunny day sometime
Can you take me ridin' babe, I'll tell you what I'm thinkin' 'bout you

Well I saw you last night on a Hollywood show
And now it's easy for me to say
That I'm head over heels shook up
About the way that you sang to me
And if it please Your Highness on a sunny day sometime
Can you take me drivin' baby, kissin' in your Cadillac
