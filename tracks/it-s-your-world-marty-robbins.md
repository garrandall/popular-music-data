Let me live in your world for a day
Even though I know my heart will fail
A lonely soul in search of happiness
Has found the world of heaven in your kiss

I knew someday someway I'd find a thrill
But finding love there too doesn't seem real
I know it's wrong and you won't let me stay
But let me live in your world for a day

And that day I know I found the way
Of living in my world so far away
Love me now and then send me away
But let me live in your world for a day
