It's Your World and your smile turns on my sunshine
You have all the power it takes to make me blue
You control the way I feel both day and night time
It's Your World and I'm just passin' thru

Let me live, let me live
Let me live in, live in your world
If only for part of the time
There must be, there must be
Oh sweet love, love in your world
Cause there just isn't any in mine

It's Your World and I don't belong in it
Foolishly I keep pretending that I do
From the start you've made it plain that you don't want me
It's your world and I'm just passin' thru
