See, the sun is shinin' hot up above
Rain will follow you when you're in love
You may wonder, I get lost in the tide
But think of me darlin', when you're hurting inside


Call my name and I'll be there
And I'll follow you everywhere
Call my name and I'll be there, baby
And I'll follow you everywhere


Nights won't ever get too dark
Days won't ever get too long
Winds won't ever blow too strong
I'll be there to wrap you in my lovin' arms


Call my name and I'll be there
And I'll follow you everywhere
Let your love light shine on me, baby
I'll be there to love you endlessly, yeah


Ah, yeah
Mmm, yeah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
(M-I-L-S-O-M-P-I-C, could be T too)


Call my name and I'll be there
And I'll follow you everywhere, baby
Let your love light shine on me
I'll be there to love you endlessly


Nights won't ever get too dark
Days won't ever get too long
Winds won't ever blow too strong
Call me, yeah, ah
Call me
