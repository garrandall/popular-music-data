Uhh, uhh, uhh
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be?
Opened my eyes, yeah
It was only just a dream
So I travel back, down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize, yeah
It was only just a dream


I was at the top and now it's like I'm in the basement
Number one spot, now she found her a replacement
I swear now I can't take it
Knowing somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around, baby I can't think
I shoulda put it down, shoulda got that ring
'Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair
My love of my life
My shorty, my wife
She left me, I'm tight
'Cause I knew that it just ain't right


Uhh, uhh, uhh
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be?
Opened my eyes, yeah
It was only just a dream
So I travel back, down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize, yeah
It was only just a dream


When I be riding man I swear I see her face at every turn
Trying to get my Usher on but I can't let it Burn
And I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn - for
My woman, oh I miss her, when will I learn?
Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinking all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she pick up the phone
But she made a decision that she wanted to move on
'Cause I was wrong


Uhh, uhh, uhh
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be?
Opened my eyes, yeah
It was only just a dream
So I travel back, down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize, yeah
It was only just a dream


If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone
And you wishing you could give them everything
Everything (heyyy)
Said if you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone
And you wishing you could give them everything


Uhh, uhh, uhh
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be?
Opened my eyes, yeah
It was only just a dream
So I travel back, down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize, yeah
It was only just a dream
Uhh, uhh, uhh
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be?
Opened my eyes, yeah
It was only just a dream
So I travel back, down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize, yeah
It was only just a dream
