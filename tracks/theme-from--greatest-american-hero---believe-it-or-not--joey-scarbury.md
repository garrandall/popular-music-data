Look at what's happened to me
I can't believe it myself.
Suddenly I'm up on top of the world
Should have been somebody else.

Believe it or not, I'm walking on air.
I never thought I could feel so free.
Flying away on a wing and a prayer
Who could it be?
Believe it or not, it's just me.

Looks like the light of a new day
Hit me from out of the blue.
Breaking me out of the spell I was in
Making all of my wishes come true.

Believe it or not, I'm walking on air.
I never thought I could feel so free.
Flying away on a wing and a prayer
Who could it be?
Believe it or not, it's just me.

This is too good to be true,
Look at me
Falling for you.
Believe it or not,
Believe it or not,
Believe it or not,
Believe it or not.
Believe it or not,
I'm walkin' on air,
I never thought I could feel so free;
Flyin' away on a wing and a pray'r,
Who could it be?
Believe it or not, it's just me.
Believe it or not,
I'm walkin' on air,
I never thought I could feel so free;
Flyin' away on a wing and a pray'r,
Who could it be?
Believe it or not, it's just me.
