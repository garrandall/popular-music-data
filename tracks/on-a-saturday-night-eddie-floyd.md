Well I'm looking for my baby
And when I found my baby
I'm going to kick back the rugs
I'm gonna pull down the shades

Well, I know everything gonna work out fine
Just me and my baby and a glass of wine
On a Saturday night, oh yeah
On a Saturday night

Listen, if we're gonna have a good time
And it might as well be a good time
We're gonna kick back the rug
We're gonna pull down the shade

'Cause I got a get you to be with you
'Cause you're kind of love, I can never get enough
On a Saturday night, oh yeah
On a Saturday night
Alright, work it out son

Well I'm looking for my baby, oh yeah
And when I find my baby
We're gonna go in the back door
I'm gonna lock up the front door

Well, I know everything, gonna work out fine
Just me and my baby and a good old wine
On a Saturday night
You know what I'm talking about, fellas, listen
On a Saturday night, oh yeah, alright now

On a Saturday night, oh yeah darling
On a Saturday night, everything uptight, baby
On a Saturday night
Just do it, alright now, yeah
On a Saturday night
