I know there's someone somewhere who loves me
I know there's someone somewhere who cares
I know there's someone somewhere who loves me
I know there's someone somewhere who cares
I'm gonna keep on a-searchin' until the angel answer
My prayer
Good thing, good things, good things, good things
Good things
Come to those who wai-ait
An' I've been waitin' a long, long time, good things
Come to those who wait
An' I wanna tell you I been waitin' long, long time
I'm gonna keep on a-waitin', until the day I can call
You mine
I'm not gonna get discouraged, I'm not gonna turn
Around
I'm not gonna get discouraged, I'm tryin' to tell you
I'm not gonna turn around
I'm gonna keep on pressin' hard and forward, until
True love, I've found
