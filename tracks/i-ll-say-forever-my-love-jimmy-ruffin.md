Forever
Forever
Forever my love
I'll say forever my love


You have come to me
And you ask me how much I care
'Cause you listened to your friends
When they told you I wasn't there
If you can't see what I feel inside
By the look of love that's planted in my eye


Just ask me how long I'll need you
Go on and ask me how long I'll love you
I'll say forever my love
I'll say forever my love
I will love you and need you


Days have passed us by
And you're feelings you care for me
And the things you thought I'd done
Could have been explained so easily
But if my feelings aren't enough for you
And the words I say can't give you all the proof


Just ask me how long I'll need you
Go on and ask me how long I'll love you
I'll say forever my love
I'll say forever my love
I will love you and need you darling


Forever is a long time
And forever I will love you
Remember what I say
As I softly speak to you in love
Oh please don't ask your friends if my feelings you are doubting
Oh darling


Just ask me how long I'll need you
Go on and ask me how long I'll love you
I'll say forever my love
I'll say forever my love
I'll want you and need you and love you forever


Forever my love
I'll say forever my love
