(Ayy, where you get that beat from? Mooktoven)
I'm in a 'Vette, I'm gettin' neck
Ain't no subliminals, only direct
My check continuous, I do not stress
Cartier skeleton, I done progressed

I'm in a 'Vette, I'm gettin' neck
Ain't no subliminals, only direct
My check continuous, I do not stress
Cartier skeleton, I done progressed
This shit I'm burnin' the best of the best
This ho I'm hittin' the best of the best
You know we fuck 'fore I'm bustin' them checks
Got one, gon' send that shit to my address

BOA send that shit to my address
Squeeze in the Lam', I just cramped up my leg
Don't let these lil' niggas gas up your head
Pushin' and ridin' with a bale in the bed
Pushin' the Tesla, a bag on the seat
My BM, she worried, she think I'ma cheat
I spazzed on the police, I think I was geeked
I maxed from a trooper, my motor was geeked
I broke his lil' jaw, that nigga was weak
Fuck it, told Johnny come bust down my teeth
Fuck it, told Mooktoven give me the beat
Dior my toes, they gon' cover my feet
My ho got them numbers, she swipin', I'm weak
Fans keep on askin' when I'm gon' release
Bought some loose diamonds to bust down the piece
Got a hotel room to bust down a freak
Bought a hotel room to bust down these bags
I do not answer the phone and she mad
I do not look at the price on the tag
Still don't do interviews, I ain't met Vlad
Still don't do interviews, I ain't met Adam
Yeah, I be pimpin' these hoes like I'm Adam
Yeah, I be sellin' that tree, I'm not chattin'
Yeah, I be killin' these niggas with fashion
Fuck it, my carpet, I look like Aladdin
I give that ho wood, I ain't talkin' 'bout cabin
Two hundred my dash, so you know I'ma max it
A UPS worker done stole my last package
I go to boutiques and I go on a shoppin' spree
I might flip out and then go on a shootin' spree
These diamonds A1, they came straight from Tiffany
I drop the hardest shit you heard in history

I'm in a 'Vette, I'm gettin' neck
Ain't no subliminals, only direct
My check continuous, I do not stress
Cartier skeleton, I done progressed
This shit I'm burnin' the best of the best
This ho I'm hittin' the best of the best
You know we fuck 'fore I'm bustin' them checks
Got one, gon' send that shit to my address

I'm in a 'Vette, I'm gettin' neck
Ain't no subliminals, only direct
My check continuous, I do not stress
Cartier skeleton, I done progressed
I'm in a 'Vette, I'm gettin' neck
Ain't no subliminals, only direct
My check continuous, I do not stress
Cartier skeleton, I done progressed
