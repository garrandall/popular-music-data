Take a walk around midnight in the city
Young Blood is hiding there somewhere
If you're looking for something to do
There's always something happening there

Like I & Bragger, we borrowed a coupe to day
Here come Pepe and she's got a friend with a chevrolet
But she ain't running
She's walking a little slow
And she ain't crying-- she's just singing a little low

They say this city will make you dirty
But you look alright
You feel real pretty when he's holding you tight
City will make you mean
But that's just make-up on your face
Love will wash you clean in the night's disgrace

Find a block where your people can find you
Keep a third eye watching behind you
You never know when you're making a memory
They will wish they were here together again, someday
Kids looking for something to get into--
Take a look
Two for the movie show
Three for the back row
Hold on tight!
Remember, you might have looked like cool twelve
But your fuse just felt like dynamite

Take a walk around midnight in the city
Young Blood will find you there, somewhere
And if you're looking for something to do
There's always something happening there
