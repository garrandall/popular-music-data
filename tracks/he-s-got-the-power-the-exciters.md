Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
He makes me do things I don't wanna do
He makes me say things I don't wanna say

And even though I wanna break away
I can't stop saying I adore him
I can't stop doing things for him
He's got the power, the power of love over me

Me, me me me me me

He makes me stay when I don't wanna stay
He makes me go when I don't wanna go
And though I try to break the spell, I know

I can't stop saying I adore him
I can't stop doing things for him
He's got the power, the power of love over me
Can't stop, can't stop, can't stop

Can't stop the way I need him
It's got me crazy as can be
Oh but I love him he's got a certain somethin'
And that's the one thing that has got a hold on me

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
He makes me do things I don't wanna do
He makes me say things I don't wanna say

And even though I wanna break away
I can't stop saying I adore him
I can't stop doing things for him
He's got the power, the power of love over me
Can't stop, can't stop, can't stop

La la la
La la la
La la la

Oh but I love him

La la la
La la la
La la la

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
He makes me do things I don't wanna do
He makes me say things I don't wanna say

And even though I wanna break away
I can't stop saying I adore him
I can't stop doing things for him
He's got the power, the power of love over me

Can't stop sayin' I adore him and doin' things for him
Can't stop sayin' I adore him and doin' things for him
Can't stop sayin' I adore him and doin' things for him
