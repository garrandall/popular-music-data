You better stop fooling if you want to get along with me
We grew up on the block and we know about poverty
So, tell all your high-falutin' friends we just can't compete
It's only been a little while and I just got on my feet


And I'm still a struggling man
Doing the best that I can
I can only take it, girl, I can only make it, girl
Long as you, you understand that baby


Stop your complaining 'cause I'm aiming to make the gray
Forget those social plans, I'm the man and this is my parade
Why should we prove to Mr. Jones that we're doing fine?
He'll find out soon enough so let's not pay him no mind


And I'm still a struggling man
Doing the best that I can
I can only take it, girl, I can only make it, girl
Long as you, you understand, yeah


La la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la


I know we can make it girl but I need the love you kill
You just compared today to the way we used to live
Those good times just won't come unless we struggle and fight
As long as you love me, girl, I know everything's alright


I'm still a struggling man
Doing the best that I can
I can only take it, girl, I can only make it, girl
Long as you, you understand
I'm still a struggling man
Doing the best that I can
Take it, girl, make it, girl
Long, try and understand it, yeah
I'm still a struggling man
Doing the best that I can
I can only take it, girl, I can only make it, girl
