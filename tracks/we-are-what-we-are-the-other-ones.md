The sun came pouring upon my face
I heard the silence of empty space
Took my passion, my dream of life
Left me, oh, too weak to fight
Please don't say it
I won't take it anymore
Why should I run and hide?
We, we are what we are
Oh, we're just like anybody else
Oh, we are what we are
Oh, we only want to be ourselves
Look above me, look all around
Imagination is what I've found
I never asked you to go away
Didn't want to, oh, cause you pain
Please don't say it
I won't take it anymore
Why should I run and hide?
We, we are what we are
Oh, we're just like anybody else
Oh, we are what we are
Oh, we only want to be ourselves
Ourselves, ourselves

We, we are what we are
Oh, we're just like anybody else
Oh, we, we are what we are
Oh, we only want to be ourselves
We are what we are (we're just like anybody else)
Oh, we're just like anybody else (we are what we are)
Oh, we are what we are
Oh, we only want to be ourselves
Oh, we, we are what we are
Oh, we're just like anybody else
Oh, we, we are what we are
Oh, we only want to be ourselves
Oh, we are what we are (we're just like anybody else)
Oh, we're just like anybody else (we are what we are)
Oh, we, we are what we are
Oh, we only want to be ourselves
