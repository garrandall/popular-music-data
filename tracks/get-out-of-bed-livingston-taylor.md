There's a festival today
Come and see it's all so fine
People who are not my kind are here
There's a festival today
The world is changing fresh and new
It's mostly green with bits of blue
But it's all here for you
And here's all you have to do:

CHORUS:
Get up, get up
Get out of bed
Let the sunshine fill your head
Listen to what your friends have said
Get up, get out of bed

Morning with a quick yawn
I'll be gone
I'll be hurrying on my way
I hear there's a bad cat
On your back
And you'd best stay in today
And tomorrow I'm here to say:

CHORUS

Can you see me clearly?
Lover I do not know
Can you hear me nearly?
Oh and I do think so
Then you ain't got far to go

CHORUS
