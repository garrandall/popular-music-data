Come out Virginia, don't let me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
Aw, but sooner or later it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one


Well, they showed you a statue, told you to pray
They built you a temple and locked you away
But they never told you the price that you pay
For things that you might have done


Only the good die young
That's what I said
Only the good die young
Only the good die young


You might have heard I run with a dangerous crowd
We ain't too pretty, we ain't too proud
We might be laughing a bit too loud
But that never hurt no one


So come on Virginia, show me a sign
Send up a signal, I'll throw you the line
The stained-glass curtain you're hiding behind
Never lets in the sun
Darling only the good die young


Only the good die young
Only the good die young


You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation
You got a brand new soul
And a cross of gold
But Virginia, they didn't give you quite enough information
You didn't count on me
When you were counting on your rosary


They say there's a heaven for those who will wait
Some say it's better, but I say it ain't
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
The sinners are much more fun
You know that only the good die young


Only the good die young
Only the good die young


Said, your mother told you "All that I could give you was a reputation."
Aw, she never cared for me
But did she ever say a prayer for me?


Come out Virginia, don't let me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
Aw, but sooner or later it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one


Only the good die young
Only the good die young
You know that only the good die young
You know that only the good die young
Oh whoo
Only the good die young
Only the good die young
