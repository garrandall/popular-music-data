Come out Virginia, don't let me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
But sooner or later it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one

Well, they showed you a statue, and told you to pray
They built you a temple and locked you away
They never have told you the price you would pay
For things that you might have done

Only the good die young
Only the good die young
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

You might have heard I run with a dangerous crowd
We ain't too pretty we ain't too proud
We might be laughing a bit too loud
But that never hurt no one

Come on Virginia show me a sign
Send up a signal I'll throw you the line
The stained-glass curtain you're hiding behind
Never lets in the sun

Only the good die young
Only the good die young
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

They got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation
You got a brand new soul
And a cross of gold
But Virginia they didn't give you quite enough information
You didn't count on me
Have you considered trying sodomy?

They say there's a heaven for those who will wait
Some say it's better but I say it ain't
I'd rather laugh with the butcher than cry with the saints
Smokers have much more fun

Only the good die young
Only the good die young
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

Yeah

You say your mother told you all that I could give you was a mild abrasion
She never cared for me
She ever say a prayer for me?
Well come out, come out Virgina, don't let me wait,
Catholic girls start much too late
Sooner or later it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one

Only the good die young
Only the good die young
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

Only the good, yeah
Only the good die young
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Uh!
