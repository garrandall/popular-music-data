I feel like I just seen the sun for the first time
You make my life bright cause you shine
It's me and you baby, it's our time
I'm living my dream, girl cause you mine
You got me skippin' down the street
And singin' love songs all out of key
I didn't smoke nothin' but I feel so high
And I know why
It's a love thing, it's got to be
Your heart's all locked and I got the key
It feels like I just won the lottery
'Cause I got my girl and she got me

You my new obsession
All I want to do
You my new obsession, girl
I feel on top of the world with you baby
I want to dance and party tonight
I feel on top of the world with my lady
I'm gonna rock your body all night
She makes me wanna sing

La, la la la

Oh, I can't get you out my mind
Everything you do is feelin' right
Remember that way you caught my eye?
I remember that way you was walkin' by
Oh girl, watch out now
You looked at me, turned around and smiled
Gave me eyes, my heart went wild
Hypnotized, this love starts now
And how do I know you're real?
It really doesn't matter, it's the way I feel
You make me feel super like the man of steel
Got me goin' stupid, pickin' daffodils

You my new obsession
All I want to do
You my new obsession, girl
I feel on top of the world with you baby
I want to dance and party tonight
I feel on top of the world with my lady
I'm gonna rock your body all night
She makes me wanna sing

La, la la la

You my new obsession

All I want to do
You my new obsession, girl
I feel on top of the world with you baby
I want to dance

Dance...

I feel on top of the world with you baby
I want to dance and party tonight
I feel on top of the world with my lady
I'm gonna rock your body all night
