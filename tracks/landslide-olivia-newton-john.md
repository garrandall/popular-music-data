Cold winds rarely blow
Here at the end of the rainbow
Guess it's hard to believe
I'd be willing to leave
Someone walked up behind me
Seemed to find me
I felt him standing there, I turned around and
Saw the face of an angel, I fell
It wasn't fair, it just wasn't fair

He took my heart, it was a landslide
You know it was a landslide
My head was saying this is the man
My heart agreed
My minor desires turned to major needs
My needs won't be denied
It was a landslide

Somehow I'm thrilled by all he says
High on his campaign promises
I don't wanna come down
I don't wanna come down
But no promises he made me could persuade me
Like the loneliness that comes on when I
Try to go on without him
Try to doubt him
I confess, I have to confess

He took my heart, it was a landslide
You know it was a landslide
My head was saying this is the man
My heart agreed
My minor desires turned to major needs
My needs won't be denied
It was a landslide

I'm in heaven when he's around
In heaven when he's around
And I'm hoping that he might be
Feeling the same as me
I'm in heaven, heaven
It isn't hard to see

He took my heart, it was a landslide
You know it was a landslide
My head was saying this is the man
My heart agreed
My minor desires turned to major needs
My needs won't be denied
It was a landslide

I'm gonna tell everybody I see
He's the only party for me
It really was a, it really was a
You know it was a landslide
It really was a landslide
My head was saying this is the man
My heart agreed
My minor desires turned to major needs
My needs won't be denied
It was a landslide
Oh it was a landslide
He took my heart, it was a landslide
Oh it was a landslide
He took my heart, it was a landslide
Oh it was a landslide
