I'm travelin' down the road and I'm flirtin' with disaster
I've got the pedal to the floor, my life is running faster
I'm out of money, out of hope, it looks like self-destruction
Well, how much more can we take with all of this corruption

We're flirtin' with disaster, y'all know what I mean
And the way we run our lives, it makes no sense to me
I don't know about yourself or what you want to be, yeah
When we gamble with our time, we choose our destiny

I'm travelin' down that lonesome road
Feel like I'm dragging a heavy load
Yeah, I've tried to turn my head away
Feel about the same most every day

You know what I'm talking about, baby

Speeding down the fast lane, honey, we're playin' from town to town
The boys and I've been burnin' it up, can't seem to slow it down
Iâve got the pedal to the floor, our lives are runnin' faster
We got our sights set straight ahead, but I ain't sure what we're after

Flirtin' with disaster, yâall damn sure know what I mean
You know, the way we run our lives, it makes no sense to me
I don't know about yourself or what you plan to be, yeah
When we gamble with our time we choose our destiny

Yeah, we're travelin' down that lonesome road
Feel like I'm dragging a heavy load
Don't try to turn my head away
I'm flirtin' with disaster every day

And you are too, baby

Flirtin' with disaster, babe, y'all know what I mean
You know the way we run our lives, it makes no sense to me
I don't know about yourself or what you plan to be
When we gamble with our time we choose our destiny

Yeah, we're traveling down this lonesome road
Feel like I'm dragging a heavy load
Don't try and turn my head away, ba ba ba yeah
Flirtin' with disaster every day
