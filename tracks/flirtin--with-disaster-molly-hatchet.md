I'm travelin' down the road, and I'm flirtin' with disaster
I got the pedal to the floor, and my life is runnin' faster
I'm out of money, out of hope it looks like self destruction
Well how much more can we take with all of this corruption

We're flirtin' with disaster, ya'll know what I mean
And the way we run our lives it makes no sense to me
I don't know about yourself or what you want to be, yeah
When we gamble with our time we choose our destiny

I'm travelin' down that lonesome road
Feel like I'm draggin' a heavy load
Yeah, I've tried to turn my head away
Feel 'bout the same most every day
(You know what I'm talkin' about, baby)
Speedin' down the fast lane from home
And we're playin' from town to town
The boys and I have been burnin' it up
Can't seem to slow us down
We got the pedal to the floor our lives are runnin' faster
We got our sights set straight ahead
But I ain't sure what we're after

Flirtin' with disaster ya'll damn sure know what I mean
You know the way we run our lives it makes no sense to me
I don't know about yourself or what you plan to be, yeah
When we gamble with our time we choose our destiny

Yeah, we're travelin' down that lonesome road
Feel like I'm draggin' a heavy load
Don't try to turn my head away
I'm flirtin' with disaster every day
(And you are too, baby)
(It ain't for everybody)
(Ah, c'mon man)

Flirtin' with disaster, babe ya'll know what I mean
You know the way we run our lives it makes no sense to me
I don't know about yourself or what you plan to be
When we gamble with our time we choose our destiny

Yeah, we're travelin' down this lonesome road
Feel like I'm draggin' a heavy load
Don't try to turn my head away, bahh bop bop yeah
I'm flirtin' with disaster every day
