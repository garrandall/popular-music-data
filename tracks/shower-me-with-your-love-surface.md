My heart is filled with so much love
And I need someone I can call my own
To fall in love, that's what everyone's dreaming of
I hold this feeling, oh, so strong

Life is too short to live alone
Without someone to call my own
I will care for you, you will care for me
Our love will live forever

Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love that I long for
Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love I've been waiting for

I close my eyes and pray all my wishes come true
Every night I go to sleep
Until you're mine, I'll wait for you endlessly
Can't you see

Fairy tales, they do sometimes come true
If you believe, it could happen to you
Like the stars that shine way up in the sky
Our love will live forever

Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love that I long for
Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love I've been waiting for

Like the stars that shine way up in the sky
Our love will live forever
Live forever

Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love that I long for
Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love I've been waiting for

Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love I've been waiting for
