Oh, come on over baby
Whole lotta twistin' goin' on
Ooo, come on over baby
Baby, you can't go wrong.
Don't cha know we ain't fakin'
Whole lotta shakin' goin' on.

Why don't cha come on over baby
There's good twistin' tonight
Wow, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.
Come over baby, baby
You can do the shimmy alright
Yeah, we ain't fakin'
Whole lot of shakin' tonight.

Come on, I said shake it baby, shake 
Ooo, twist baby, twist 
Oh, shake baby, shake 
Yeah, twist baby, twist 
Come on over
Whole lot of twistin' goin' on.

Well, I said come on over baby
We got chicken in the barn
Whose barn what barn my barn
Come on over baby
We really got the bull by the horn
Yeah, we ain't fakin'
Whole lot of shakin' goin' on

Easy Now. Shake 
Ahhhh. twist it baby 
Yeah, you can twist one time for me 
Ah come on, come on a baby 
Whole lot of shakin' goin' on 
Now let's get real low, one time now.

Shake baby, shake 
All you gotta do honey, is kinda stand in one spot 
Wiggle around just a little bit 
That's all you gotta do, yeah 
Oh babe whole lotta shakin' goin' on 
Now, let's go one more time.

Shake it, Baby, shake 
Shake it, Baby, shake
Twist it baby, come on baby, shake baby, shake 
Come on over, whole lot of shakin' goin on...
