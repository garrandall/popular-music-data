Vocal By Buddy Miles

Oh, I bet you're wondering how I knew
Bout your plans to make me blue
Of some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys
You know I love you more

It took me by surprise, I must say
Then I found out yesterday

Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah

(Heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you
Be my baby, oh oohohoh

I know a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears that I hold inside
Losing you would end my life, you see
Cause you mean that much to me

You could have told me yourself
That you love somebody else

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Hey, said I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah

(Heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you
Be my baby, ohoohhoh

People say believe half of what you see
Now now now, from what you hear
I can't help being confused
If it's true, then tell me, dear

Do you plan to let me go
For some other guy you knew before

Hey, I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Said I heard it through the grapevine
Hey, I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah

(Heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you
Be my baby, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Honey, honey, I know
That you're letting me go
Hey, I heard it through the grapevine
(Heard it through the grapevine)
I heard it through the grapevine

Say I heard it through the grapevine
(Heard it through the grapevine)
Noy much longer would you be mine
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Said I heard it through the grapevine
(Heard it through the grapevine)
I heard it (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Honey, I know, I know...
