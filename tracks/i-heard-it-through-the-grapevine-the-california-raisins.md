I am everything that I said I am
Keep my shit tight man, motherfuckin' Hoover Dam
And I ain't cracking anytime soon, my mind said it's fine-tuned
This world will be mine soon
Show down at high noon, sharp as a harpoon
Crash like a monsoon, style like a costume
I'm constantly awesome
Voice fresh as spring, yo my beats bout to blossom
Caution, get out the pit when I'm moshin'
My friends are all high, yeah, I'm nice and I got 'em that way
We Bulls on Parade
My bowl's full of weed man, higher than a pterodactyl
You can call me caveman, California raisin
Hear me through the grapevine
Duddy B be dazed again but man I'm feelin' just fine
I be out in Vegas while ya bitches just at state line
I ain't never stoppin' 'til I finally feel I got mine


We're never gonna lay down, we ain't going nowhere, you can come and give a try
Our bond is our blood and thicker than water, like Goonies never say die
'Cause Goonies never say
'Cause Goonies never say die


I keep it cool right, I'm like an avalanche
I get stupid when I want to, Rain Man
I keep it flowing, now I do the rain dance
Man everybody loves me call me Raymond
Here I go, I be gettin' so high like I'm standing on my tippy toes
Spread my wings and fly but I got two arms where my wings should go
Hungry as an animal, tearin' down the devil's door
He's sellin' me his soul for all the lyrics in my arsenal
Eyes red, lungs full, half-masted flag pole
I'm about to kill this beat and throw it in a drowning pool
Hair long, style cool, lyrics fresh, jet fuel
On this track no looking back, I'm hippie like a hacky sac
Smoother than a Cadillac, leave MCs needing medi-vac
Yeah I lost my shit but bitch you know I got my passion back
Locked inside my temper trap, I'm laughin' at your pussycats
'Cause I ain't never stopping 'til the top is what I'm lookin' at


We're never gonna lay down, we ain't going nowhere, you can come and give a try
Our bond is our blood and thicker than water, like Goonies never say die
'Cause Goonies never say
'Cause Goonies never say die


Okay listen up kiddos I'm a shark you're a minnow
Balls on your chin, call your bitch Jay Leno
Don't go swimmin' 'cause your shit sounds menstrual
And we ain't here to play Dr. Dre South Central
Spit barbiturates to make you rub your tits and shit
Have your body moving, shaking hips and throwing fits
Willie sittin' high, just as high
The time is nigh now I'm floorin' my DeLorean, Marty McFly yeah
Anybody home, two spliffs to the dome
It's a headshot, dread naught, noobs get pawned!
Yeah I fucking said it, it was so last year
I got a pack full of gear and a trunk full of beer


We're never gonna lay down, we ain't going nowhere, you can come and give a try
Our bond is our blood and thicker than water, like Goonies never say die
We're never gonna lay down, we ain't going nowhere, you can come and give a try
Our bond is our blood and thicker than water, like Goonies never say die
'Cause Goonies never say
'Cause Goonies never say die
