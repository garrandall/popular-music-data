Here at the party I came to alone
Ramblers are rambling you stared at your phone
I'll stick around if you stick around too
I wanna know why you hide in your hair
Where do you go when you glide down the stairs?
I'll stick around if you stick around too

You and I break out just a matter of time
There's a reason we don't live forever
Reason we don't live forever
You and I break out just a matter of time
There's a reason we don't live forever
Reason we don't live forever
You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I

Waking with you in the home that we've made
Dishes are dirty and bills to be paid
I'll stick around if you stick around too

You and I break out just a matter of time
There's a reason we don't live forever
Reason we don't live forever
You and I break out just a matter of time
There's a reason we don't live forever
Reason we don't live forever
You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I

Now that we're older with gray in our hair
Holding your hand as we glide down the stairs
I'll stick around if you stick around too

You and I break out just a matter of time
There's a reason we don't live forever
Reason we don't live forever

You and I break out just a matter of time
There's a reason we don't live forever
Reason we don't live forever

You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I
