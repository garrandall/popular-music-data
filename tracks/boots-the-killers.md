Oh, God, oh, God
Dear father in heaven
I'm not a praying man but if you're up there and you can hear me
Show me the way
I'm at the end of my road and I...
Show me the way, oh God


No more trouble in this town
Silent night for a change
A brand new year coming up ahead
You know it's been so long since I rang one in
I close my eyes, think about the path I took
Just when I think these times have gotten the best of me


I can see my mother in the kitchen, my father on the floor
Watching television, it's a wonderful life
Cinnamon candles burning, snowball fights outside
Smile below each nose and above each chin
Stomp my boots before I go back in


I wasted my wishes on Saturday nights
Boy, what I would give for just one more
I'd soften my heart, shock the world
Do you hear my voice?
Do you know my name?
Light my way, lift my head, light my way


I can see my mother in the kitchen, my father on the floor
Watching television, it's a wonderful life
Cinnamon candles burning, snowball fights outside
Smile below each nose and above each chin
Stomp my boots before I go back in


Family all together, presents piled high
Frost on all the windows, what a wonderful night
Cinnamon candles burning, snowball fights outside
Smile below each nose and above each chin


So happy they found me
Love was all around me
Stomp my boots before I go back in
