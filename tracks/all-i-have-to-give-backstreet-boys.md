I don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car
To get to you I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart?
I don't know, but if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart


But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give


When you talk, does it seem like he's not
Even listening to a word you say?
That's okay, babe, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does he leave when you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby, please, I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine


But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
Oh, to you


Hey, girl
I don't want you to cry no more inside
All the money in the world
Could never add up to
(All the love I have inside, inside of you)
And I will give it to you
(All I can give, all I can give)
(Everything I have is for you)
You're the one I need
(My love is)
All that I have to give
(All that I have is for you)


But my love is all I have to give
My love is all
Without you I don't think I could live
I don't think that I can live without you
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
It's all that I have
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give


To you, oh
I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
Give the world to you, baby
But love is all I have to give
That's all I got to give
But my love is all I have to give
Yeah, yeah
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
