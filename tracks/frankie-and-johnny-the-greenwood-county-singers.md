Little Frankie
Went down to the barroom
She asked for a glass of beer
She said, hey, bartender
Has my Johnny been here
He's my man but he's
Done me wrong

The bartender said, Frankie
You know I won't tell you no lie
He left here about a minute ago
With a gal named Alice Fry
He's your man but he's
Doing you wrong

Frankie was a good little woman
Surely everybody knows
She paid one hundred dollars for
Johnny's new suit of clothes
She loved her man but
He done her wrong

Then Frankie went down Broadway
With a razor in her hand
She said, stand back
All you women
I'm looking for my cheating man
Yes, he's my man but
He's done me wrong

It was on a Friday morning
About a half past nine o'clock
Frankie pulled her.44
And fired three fatal shots
She shot her man cause
He done her wrong

Why don't you run, Frankie
They said, Frankie
Why don't you run

Cause here comes
The Chief Of Police
With the.44 smokeless gun
You killed your man
We know he done you wrong

Yeah, he done you wrong, Frankie
You should've shot him forty times
I'm a witness, Frankie
