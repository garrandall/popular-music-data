In a perfect world
It would never end like this
There'd be something we could do

In a perfect world
Lovers wake up with a kiss
And their wishes all come true

But here we are
I thought you belonged to me
It seemed like the
Perfect arrangement
Ain't it funny when you find
How wrong you can be cause

Oh, this ain't no perfect world
I've got my problems
No, this ain't no perfect world
You've got your problems, too
Now what do we do

In a perfect world
I'd have been the boy you need
I'd have been somebody else

In a perfect world
You'd have been the girl for me
Yeah, you could have been yourself

You see, we're dying for love
But we're afraid to drop our guard
We're lost in a world gone crazy
Where the men won't grow up
And the women get so hard

Oh, this ain't no perfect world
And I've got my problems
No, this ain't no perfect world
Cause you've got your problems too
Now what do we do

I don't know
If we wind up friends
I don't know
If we wind up strangers

Cause I never had to
Walk away from anybody
I wanted as much
As I wanted you

Oh, this ain't no perfect world
Cause I've got my problems
Oh, this ain't no perfect world
Cause you've got your problems too

Oh, this ain't no perfect world
Oh, no, no
Oh, this ain't no perfect world
