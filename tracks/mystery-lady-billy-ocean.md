Hey there Mystery Lady can I spend the night with you
Can I have your number I'll be anything you want me to
We ought to get something started
Oh I can tell so very well
He has left you brokenhearted
It's time to start mending you heart
Darling when the nights are cold and lonely - I will keep you warm
You need to be loved by me - Mystery Lady
You need to be loved by me - Mystery Lady
Hey there Mystery Lady love is but a kiss away
And you can bet you bottom dollar
I'll do anything to make you stay
So let's get something started
Why hesitate oh I can't wait
There is something that you're missing
The fire in your eyes - you can't disguise
Darling when the nights are cold and lonely - I will keep you warm
You need to be loved by me Mystery Lady
You need to be loved by me Mystery Lady
You need to be loved by me Mystery Lady
Girl I'll come knocking at your door
Caught in your magic just look what you've started
We ought to get something started oh I can tell so very well
That he's left you broken hearted it's time to start mending your heart
So darling when the nights are cold and lonely I will keep you warm
