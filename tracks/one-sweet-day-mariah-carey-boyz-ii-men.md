Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say
And now it's too late to hold you
'Cause you've flown away
So far away
Ayyy


Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feeling and knowing you hear me
It keeps me alive
Alive


And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together

One sweet day

Eventually I'll see you in heaven...


Darling, I never showed you (I never showed you)
Assumed you'd always be there (I thought you'd always be there)
I took your presence for granted
But I always cared
( But I always cared)
And I miss the love we shared


And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together

One sweet day
 Eventually I'll see you in heaven


Although the sun will never shine the same
I'll always look to a brighter day

Yeah
Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep
You will always listen as I pray


And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
 Together
One sweet day


And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
 Together
One sweet day

 Sorry I never told you (oooh)
 All I wanted to say
