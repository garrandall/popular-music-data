You better take it easy, baby
Before you go away
You did me dirty
But you'll get yours one day

You better (watch your step)
Talking about you (watch your step)
You better (watch your step)
(Watch your step)

Keep your eyes open wide
'Cause you'll be hurting down inside
(Watch your step)
(Watch your step)

You better leave me all your money
Before you go away
Don't think I'm funny, honey
But all I've gotta say

You better (watch your step)
Whoa, oh (watch your step)
(Watch your step)
(Watch your step)

'Cause when you
Took your love from me
You left me full of misery
(Watch your step) hey, hey
(Watch your step)

I'm gonna miss your loving every night
When I get myself together
I'm gonna be all right now
Yeah, yeah

(Watch your step)
(Watch your step)
(Watch your step)
(Watch your step)

Need me by your side
I'm gonna say
Go somewhere and hide
(Watch your step) hey, hey
(Watch your step)

You better watch out, baby
(Watch your step)
Everything you do
(Watch your step)
I'm gonna keep my eyes focused
(Watch your step)
Right on you
(Watch your step)

You're gonna look out, honey
(Watch your step)
Eerywhere you go
(Watch your step)...
