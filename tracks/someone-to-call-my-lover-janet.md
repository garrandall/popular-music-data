Back on the road again
Feeling kinda lonely
And looking for the right guy
To be mine
Friends say I'm crazy cause
Easily I fall in love
You gotta do it different A
This time

Maybe we'll meet at a bar
He'll drive a funky car
Maybe we'll meet at a club
And fall so deeply in love
He'll tell me I'm the one
And we'll have so much fun
I'll be the girl of his dreams
Maybe

Alright maybe gonna find him today
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby come on
Alright baby come in, pass my way
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby come on

I spoil her when I'm in love
Given her what she dreams of
Sometimes it's not a good thing
But I'm blind
I love hard with everything
Giving my all more than they
I'll take my friends' advice this time
I'll do it differently

Maybe we'll meet at a bar
She'll drive a funky car
Maybe we'll meet at a club
And fall so deeply in love
She'll tell me I'm the one
And we'll have so much fun
I'll be the girl of her dreams
Maybe

Alright maybe gonna find her today
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby come on
Alright baby come in, pass my way
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby come on

Gotta have what I like in a man

Alright, find him today

Alright maybe gonna find him today
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby come on
Alright baby come in, pass my way
