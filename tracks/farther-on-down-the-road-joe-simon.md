Alright
Baby, you're alright
Oh honey, you're alright
Farther on down the road
You will accompany, oh yeah
Farther on down the road
You will accompany, oh yeah
When I think back
Your love was like a sun
I don't remember the cold days
I just remember the warm
Farther on down the road
Girl, you will accompany, oh yes, you will
If a fusing life that I had before
I'd rather be, oh yeah
I'll be glad to learn from you and I know, good and well, honey
You'd be glad to learn from me, oh yeah
If we get down and things get sad
We can cheer up each other
And  things just ain't that bad
If a fusing life
That I'd had before, girl
I'd rather be
I'm happy
As long as you're with me
I don't have to worry
I love, I love you
Day by day
One step, one step at a time
You gave me so much love
Just an ease this old aching heart on mine, oh yeah
I don't know where they came from
And I don't know what they might say, woman
You always been in my heart
Oh, day by day
It's the magic of kindness
Flowing all the time, that's all love is
Farther on down the road
Girl, you will accompany, oh yes you will
I don't have to worry, baby
I do believe you'd love me
You'd love me, you'd love me
You'd love me, you'd love me
You know I'd love you too, honey
We don't have to worry
Farther on down the road
Evey thing gonna be alright
Alright, alright, alright
