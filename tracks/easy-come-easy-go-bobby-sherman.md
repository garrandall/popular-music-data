I'm taking the shade out of the sun
Whatever made me think that I was number one
I oughta know, easy come, easy go
Sittin' it out, I'm spinnin' the dial
Thinkin' about the chump I've been ,I have to smile
Didn't I know, easy come, easy go
She wasn't kind, I wasn't smart
I lost my mind and fell apart
I had to find myself in time
Now I can start all over again
Just Hangin' around, takin' it slow
So happy I found I still can smile and dig the show
Lettin' me know, easy come, easy go
