Yeah
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Whoo! Aha, uh, whoo, yeah! Ready
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

Can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar

Uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah!
Now, what the hell are you waitin' for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, make some noise

Get 'em Jay!

Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah, hearin' me rap is like hearin' G rap in his prime

I'm Young H.O., rap's grateful dead
'Bout to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect

On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand openin', grand closin'
Damn, your man Hov' cracked the can open again

Who you gon' find doper than him with no pen
Just draw off inspira- (-tion-tion)
Soon you gon' see you can't replace(him him)
With cheap imitations for these generations

Can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah
Now, what the hell are you waitin' for

After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise
What the hell are you waiting for?

Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you

From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yeah)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye

When I come back like Jordan
We're in the four five, it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens

Sucker, take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold out concerts
So, m-r, if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore

I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take!

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb

Can I get an encore? Do you want more? (more, more, more)
I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar
