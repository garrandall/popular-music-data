Hoo-wee, baby
Baby you`re so fine
Gotta have your loving any old time
Oh, baby
Baby, baby
You`re so fine, fine, fine

Hoo-wee, baby
Remember last night?
You said you were leaving
We had a big fight
Oh, baby
Baby, baby
You`re so fine, fine, fine

Remember the night I met you?
We danced until a quarter to two
You held my hands and you kissed my lips
Baby, what you trying a-do?
Woo-woo-woo

Hoo-wee, baby
Gotta let you know
What you reap, baby
You sure gotta sow
Oh, baby
Baby, baby
You`re so fine, fine, fine



Hoo-wee, baby
Baby, you`re so fine
Gotta have your loving any old time
Oh, baby
Baby, baby
You`re so fine, fine, fine
Oh, baby
Like to make-a your all mine, mine, mine

Oh, baby
Baby, baby
You`re so fine, fine, fine
Oh, baby
