Nice legs, Daisy dukes, makes a man go 
Thats the way they all come through like 
Low-cut, see-through shirts that make you 
Thats the way she come through like 


'Cause I just set them up, just set them up, just set them up to knock them down,
'Cause I just set them up, just set them up, just set them up to knock them down.

I think I should know, how, to make love to something innocent without leaving my fingerprints out,
Now, L.O.V.E's just another word I never learned to pronounce.
How, do I say I'm sorry 'cause the word is never gonna come out,
Now, L.O.V.E's just another word i never learned to pronounce.

Tight jeans, Double D's makin' me go 
All the people on the street know 
Iced-out, lit-up make the kids go 
All the people on the street know 


'Cause I just set them up, just set them up, just set them up to knock them down,
'Cause I just set them up, just set them up, just set them up to knock them down,

I think I should know, how, to make love to something innocent without leaving my fingerprints out,
Now, L-O-V-E's just another word i never learned to pronounce,
How, do I say I'm sorry cause the word is never gonna come out,
Now, L.O.V.E's just another word I never learned to pronounce.


You know that type of s**t just don't work on me,
Whistling and trying to flirt with me,
Don't take it personally 'cause we were never in love,
It doesn't really matter who you say you are,
Singing at the window of your car,
Find another girl across the bar 'cause L.O.V.E's not what this was,

I think I should know,(oh ohh)
how,(oh ohh)to make love to something innocent without leaving my fingerprints out,(oh ohh)
Now,(oh ohh)L-O-V-E's just another word i never learned to pronounce,(oh ohh)
How,(oh ohh)do I say I'm sorry cause the word is never gonna come out,(oh ohh)
Now,(oh ohh)L.O.V.E's just another word I never learned to pronounce.
