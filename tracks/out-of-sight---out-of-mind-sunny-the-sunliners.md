Out of sight out of mind
So the story goes
You forgot I exist
My broken heart knows
Out of sight out of mind
You found someone new
But I can't change my love
The way you do
I sit around wondering
About your new affair
I should forget to remember
And remember not to care
I would laugh if I could
But my heart is blind
You are gone out of sight
But not out of my mind
I sit around wondering
About your new affair
I should forget to remember
And remember not to care
I'd forget if I could
But my heart is blind
You are gone out of sight
But not out of my mind
Out of sight
But not out of my mind
Yes you are gone out of sight
But you're not out of my mind
