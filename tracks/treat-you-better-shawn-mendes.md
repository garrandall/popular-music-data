I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman

Tell me why are we wasting time on all your wasted crime
When you should be with me instead

But I can treat you better


I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face when you say that he's the one that you want
And your spending all your time in this wrong situation and anytime you want it to stop

I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time on all your wasted crime
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Oh better than he can


Alright let's do this
I'll stop time for you
The second you say you want me to
And I just wanna give you the lovin that your missin
Baby just to wake up to you
We'll be everything I need
And this could be so different
Tell me what you wanna do


Yeah I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time on all your wasted crime
When you should be with me instead
Yeah I know I can treat you better
Hey eyey


Tell me why are wasting time on all your wasted crime
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better


Better than he can
