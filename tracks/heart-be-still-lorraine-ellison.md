Baby, my heart is breaking
And there's no hope, no hope inside

The sky is an ocean of darkness
No one to hold me
In the lonely night

Tell me, how can I forget you
How can I sleep (Lay myself down to rest)
I love you
I love you and always will

When you're lonely and feeling blue
Don't forget about the true love
That I gave to you
You know you don't have to be alone, no
My arms are waiting
Come home, come home, come home

Don't move, don't move, don't move, don't move
Heart be still...
