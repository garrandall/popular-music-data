It's morning
And we slept the night away
It happened
Now we can't turn back
The hands of time (oh no)

Yes, we've stolen this moment
We forgot to face
One simple fact
We both belong
To someone else
As we slept the night away


It's morning
Sunlight shines across
Your sleeping face
A new day
Brings reality that
We must go our separate ways

What a lovely night
We had (yeah yeah)
As we shared each other's love
We forgot about
All the pain we'd cause
As we slept the night away


As we lay
We forgot about tomorrow
As we lay (mmhmm, hey hey)

As we lay
We didn't think about the price
We'd have to pay
(Oh no, no no no, no no no, no)


It's morning
And now it's time for us to say goodbye
Goodbye, baby
You're leaving me
I know you got to hurry home
To face your wife (whoa)

I would never want to hurt her
No
She would never understand
You belonged to me for
Just one night
As we slept the night away


I would never want to hurt her, no
She would never understand

You belonged to me for
Just one night
As we slept the night away



We should have counted up the cost
But instead we got lost
In the second
In the minute
In the hour

Hey hey, hey
As we lay
We forgot about tomorrow
As we lay
Whoa

It's morning
(it's morning)
(Oo oo)

It's morning
(whoa)
It's morning
