Fresh off the plane
I can feel the wind
Know what I'm saying
Baby girl
Knew just what I was phased with, same shit
And she gonna make the time when the time's right
And she gonna show me love when love won't
I'm just saying, maybe she's thinking

That I'm with it
Just say the word and I'm out and I'm wit it
Everytime she be calling I'm wit it
We both know the sound when she's calling

2 many nights in LA
I spent 2 many nights in LA
2 many nights in LA
I took too many nights with her so

I'm stuck here thinking about you
This crazy love the way it is
I know you're done thinking about me
But I can't stay away from her
Baby I don't know where this is going
These California nights pulled me away
And everytime she calls you pull away
I'm just thinking, maybe she's thinking

That I'm with it
Just say the word and I'm out and I'm wit it
Everytime she be calling I'm wit it
We both know the sound when when we making love

2 many nights in LA
I spent 2 many nights in LA
2 many nights in LA
I took 2 many nights with her so

Everything you say it don't matter
What you thinking about all the time when you had her?
Spending all the time out there in LA
Listening to Shirley Murdock as we lay
I don't really know what you saw in her
Hanging up the phone saw you calling her
You will never know what you mean to me
Damn I really thought that you needed me

I'm with it
Just say the word and I'm out and I'm wit it
Everytime she be calling I'm wit it
We both know the sound when when we making love

2 many nights in LA
I spent 2 many nights in LA
2 many nights in LA
I took 2 many nights with her so

2 many nights in LA
I spent 2 many nights in LA
2 many nights in LA
I took 2 many nights with her so

2 many nights in LA
I spent 2 many nights in LA
2 many nights in LA
I took 2 many nights with her so

2 many nights in LA
I spent 2 many nights in LA
2 many nights in LA
I took 2 many nights with her so
