Oh...oh...oh...oh... (Yeah)
If they gleam in the sun
while they spin and they fit on my truck then
And if it came in the sack
No stems no seeds in the bag girl

And if they drip from my wrist and they look like they shine like new then

But Ohhh girl
I forgot to be your lover

If it wasn't for the 9 to 5
Double-up overtime then
If it wasn't for the Sunday all star
weekend games girl

And if it wasn't for the dough
Gettin fifty g's a show girl ya know that
But silly me, silly me
Ohhh
Tell me how could I ever forget to be your lover

Now I realize that you need love too (Oh, yeah)
Spend my life makin' love to you
Oh, girl
Oh, I forgot to be your lover

When she starts bringin' up old dirt
And the fights keep getting worse (Oh, brother)
Findin' numbers in her purse
Better put that woman first (Yeah)

And you know she ain't wearin' her ring (Oh, no)
When she starts playin' little games
Comin' in late from work
You better put that woman first

If it wasn't for the make up on my shirt
Still I'd be chasin' skirts then
And if it wasn't for that fight last night
You smashin out my headlights then

If it wasn't for parole
Steady duckin' my P O girl you know
But silly me, silly me, babe
Tell me how could I ever forget to be your lover

Now I realize that you need love too
Spend my life makin' love to you
Oh, girl
Oh, I forgot to be your lover

When she starts bringin' up old dirt (Bringin' up old shhhh)
And the fights keep getting worse
(Oh...oh...oh...oh...)
Findin' numbers in her purse (I'm tellin' you, brother)
Better put that woman first (You better put your woman first)

And you know she ain't wearin' her ring (Oh, yeah)
When she starts playin' little games (I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm tellin' you, brother)
Comin' in late from work
You better put that woman first (Put that woman first)

 Actin like it wasn't really nothin'
 Kept to myself, always runnin'
 All that I sin
 I need you to stay
 Even though sometimes fallin'
second
 You know I had to win the last race
 Put in some work
 Always put that woman first

When she starts bringin' up old dirt
And the fights keep getting worse (Gettin' worse)
Findin' numbers in her purse (In her purse)
Better put that woman first (Put that woman first)

And you know she ain't wearin' her ring (Oh yeah)
When she starts playin' little games (Her little games)
Comin' in late from work (I'mma say it again)
You better put that woman first (Put that woman, put that woman first)

When she starts bringin' up old dirt
And the fights keep getting worse (She's gonna leave you)
Findin' numbers in her purse
Better put that woman first (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

And you know she ain't wearin' her ring (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
When she starts playin' little games (Yeah, yeah)
Comin' in late from work
You better put that woman first
