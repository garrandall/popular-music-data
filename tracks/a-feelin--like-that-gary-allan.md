I stepped out into the blue
Felt the wind hit my face
Before my shoot opened I felt my heart race
I was fallin
Oh that's just fallin

Off the coast of australia 
I dove way down deep 
For all that I saw of that Great Barrier Reef 
It was nothin 
Compared to you it was nothin


I got Lightning in my vains 
thunder in my chest.
all tangled up with you and tryin to catch my breath
I've been chasing that sensation half way 
around the world and lookin' back
on what we had.
I've done it all i've seen it all but I can't find a feelin' like that.


I wound up in some town in spain
runnin with the bulls 
Tryin to catch another thrill with a thousand other fools
We were runnin 
Ah but thats just runnin 
when I started pushin 30 
it started pushin back
Well how was I to know till now you'd be such a hard act to follow
Nothin seems to follow

 
I got Lightning in my vains 
thunder in my chest.
all tangled up with you and tryin to catch my breath
I've been chasing that sinsation half way 
around the world and lookin' back
on what we had.
I've done it all i've seen it all but I can't find a feelin' like that.

It's like flyin down some back road at midnight 
with you eyes closed and the head lights off 
Your life is searchin everywhere can't find that feelin anywhere 
Your all I want, now all I want is that...

Lightning in my vains 
thunder in my chest.
all tangled up with you and tryin to catch my breath
I've been chasing that sensation half way 
around the world and looin back
on what we have.
I've done it all i've seen it all but I can't find a feelin' like that.

thats right I've done it all 
I've seen it all but I can't find a fellin like that
