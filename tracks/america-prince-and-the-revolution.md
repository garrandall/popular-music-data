Girl, you excite me so
Ooh wee baby, your body's like no other
Girl, it's you I gotta know
Ooh wee baby, I bet you're quite a lover
Ooh girl, I wanna take you home
Ooh wee baby, you're dreaming I scream inside you

I want you in the worst way
You make me...

Girl
Girl

Girl, won't you kiss me?
Ooh wee baby, my lips they want you so
Girl, how can you resist me?
The smell of animal lust is all, all over me
Oh girl, if I could hold your hand
I'd make you touch my body until you understand
I'm your man
All night, all day

I want you in the worst way
You make me...

Caress the flower
Warm, warm
Bring it to the garden
The garden?
Be poetic
Tell me what it feels like
A sea of electricity?
Now that's wonderful
Talk to you? Talk to you?
What do you wanna hear?
If I was anything else I'd be the water in your bath, darling
Mmm

Girl
Girl, you excite me so
Ooh wee baby, my flesh is on fire
Girl
Girl, the way you play with it
Ooh wee baby, I think you desire me
Girl

Make a wish, baby
Anything
We'll make it come true
Me and you
I want you in the worst way

You make me...
Ooh girl

Girl
Girl

You like the dreaming I scream...
Girl, your lips are so wet
Girl
Feel my hands, they're all sweaty
