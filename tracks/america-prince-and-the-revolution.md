Yeah
Peace!


Aristocrats on a mountain climb
Making money, losing time
Communism is just a word
But if the government turn over
It'll be the only word that's heard


America, America
God shed his grace on thee
America, America
Keep the children free


Little sister making minimum wage
Living in a one room jungle-monkey cage
Can't get over, she's almost dead
She may not be in the black
But she's happy she ain't in the red


America, America
God shed his grace on thee
America, America
Keep the children free


Freedom
Love
Joy
Peace


Jimmy Nothing never went to school
They made him pledge allegiance
He said it wasn't cool
Nothing made Jimmy proud
Now Jimmy lives on a mushroom cloud


America, America
God shed his grace on thee
America, America
Keep the children free
America, America
God shed his grace on thee
America, America
Keep the children free


Freedom
Love
Joy
Peace


Boom
Boom
Boom
Boom
The bomb go
Boom
Boom
Boom
Boom
The bomb go boom
Teacher, why won't Jimmy pledge allegiance?
