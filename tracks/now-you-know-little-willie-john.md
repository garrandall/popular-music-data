There was nothing I could do
Where's Willie John?
Dead so long
Born to fall, nothing at all
Who's gonna grieve
When you're gone?
I once believed
I wouldn't bleed
I seen all these good looking women
While I'm getting off the plane
Remember where my baby is
Start thinkin' 'bout my baby
All she ever knew was trouble
And for much I was to blame
But when I heard the news that night
I went down like a satellite
And when my world stood still that night
I dropped like a satellite 
She never knew how much I loved her
She never knew how much I cared
I thought I'd get back to my special one
I thought I'd get on a lucky run
I said I'd get back to my special one
I said I'd get on a lucky run
God damn
Where's Willie John?
Dead so long
Born to fall, like nothing at all
Now who's gonna grieve 
When you're gone?
I once believed I'd never bleed
But lord I'm all alone tonight
Don't the sun love it's satellite?
Lord I'm all alone tonight
Don't the sun love it's satellite?
I don't know
Seein' all these good looking women
And remember where my baby is
Start thinkin' 'bout my baby
Remember where my baby is
Start me thinkin' 'bout my baby 
Where's my baby?
