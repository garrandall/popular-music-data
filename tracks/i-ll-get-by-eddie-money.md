1985 white Lamborghini Countach, 2 of em

I need a slow motion video right now
Cause Iâm moving in slow motion, slow motion
Feelinâ like Hype Williams shooting a nigga
Shooting a nigga, hey hey hey
I need a slow motion video right now ay ay

Damn baby, pussy canât be your only hustle
Unless you bad as Naomi Russell
I mean a lot of niggas got money
So basically, Russell ainât the only Russell
Russell Brand, Russell Crowe
Zero Zero Zero Zero, a whole lot of 0âs
What you after, actor money?
You in line behind currency, yeah you after money
Bullet proof condom when Iâm in these hoes
Got staples on my dick (why) fuckinâ centerfolds
And I swear to God they so cold
Got a nigga in Miami wearing winter clothes
I got my fur on feelinâ like Jerome
She got her fur too, we get our his and her on
Donât look at the jewelry, or get your blurr on
Too close, you comatose so dope you overdose
Get back, you overclose
Oh no, the hood was strugglinâ
But then I blessed them with that Polo
Niggas was making music and then my first soloâ¦
Collo Drolo sponsored by Manolo
She got Zeppi Notos ready for some photos
Yeah and Iâm cold bitch, please try to keep the door closed
Lanvin thousand dollar tee with no logos
Let me show you what I see when my eyes closed


Take it how you want til a nigga dead
(Til then Iâm the illest motherfucker alive)
Whole world aiming at a nigga head
(Because Iâm the illest motherfucker alive)


Holla, King Hov, Iâm exactly what the fuck you think
11 in a row, Bill Russell rings, Michael Jordan swag
Y'all think Michael Jordan bad
Nigga I got a 5 more rings than Michael Jordan had
Elvis has left the building now Iâm on the Beatles ass
Niggas hear Watch The Throne, yeah itâs like the Beatles back
Bey Bey my Yoko Ono, Rih Rih complete the family
Imagine how thatâs gon' look front row at the Grammy's
Fuck your awards like Eddie Murphyâs couch
The Roc is in the building we should have stayed in the house
I donât even know what we doing here
Seems to me a complete waste of gear
Just a fuckin waste of time, a complete waste of bottles
Niggas fashion is weak, they be wastinâ all the models
Got the over-sized Rolley let me show the how to do it
When I say it then you see, it ainât only in the music
Basquiats, Warhols serving as my muses
My house like a museum, so I see em when Iâm peeing
Usually you have this much taste you European
Thatâs the end of that way of thinking, nigga never again
Know when to leave when the heat is coming, I learned that
This is where DiNero would be if he ainât turn back
Fuck Sosa, this Hova this is real life
This is what the ending of Scarface should feel like


I need a slow motion video right now
Cause Iâm moving in slow motion slow motion
Feelinâ like Hype Williams shooting a nigga
Shooting a nigga hey hey hey
I need a slow motion video right now ay ay

Slow motion slow motion...
