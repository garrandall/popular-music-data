Give me one last look
As you walk away
I, I don't know what to say
I start callin' out your name
But I just can't find the words
I know will change your mind
I've tried a thousand times
But I just can't make it right

Someday I pray there will come a day
When I can open up my heart and love again
Until then I'll get by
Somehow I'll get by
I know I'll get by

I take a look around
I see this lonely room
I used to share with you
Now I want to paint it blue
'Cause everywhere I turn
There's something else I find
The notes you left behind
Were you tryin' to be kind?

Tell you somethin' baby, there will come a day
When I can open up my heart and love again
Till then I'll pretend; I'll play the fool
Someday I'll find another someone just like you
Till then I'll get by
Somehow I'll get by
I know I'll get by

My heart don't own me
Can't think about it any more
Love's just a memory
Surrounded by these lonely walls

Lately I've been thinkin'
I should move away
No reason left to stay
This house is haunted anyway

I'll tell you something baby, there will come a day
When I can open up my heart and love again
Until then I'll get by
Somehow I'll get by
I know I'll get by
