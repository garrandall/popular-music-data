Bet you think I'm sitting at home. No.
Bet you think that I'm all alone. No.
Bet you think I'm missing you and wishing you would call my phone,
Hell, no!

I went wheels up on a runway
And that ticket was a one-way

I'm somewhere on a beach
Sipping something strong,
Got a new girl, she got it going on
We drink all day, and party all night
I'm way too gone to have you on my mind
She got a body and she's naughty,
And she got me like you ain't ever got me.
I'm getting sun, getting some, and I ain't slept in a week
Yeah, I'm somewhere on a beach.

Heard you called my boys,
Heard you called my folks
They said you drove by my house real slow
You can check any spot, roll down every road
But, girl, I ain't even close

I'm somewhere on a beach
Sipping something strong,
Got a new girl, she got it going on
We drink all day, and party all night
I'm way too gone to have you on my mind
She got a body and she's naughty,
And she got me like you ain't ever got me
I'm getting sun, getting some, and I ain't slept in a week
Yeah, I'm somewhere on a beach.

I wish it could've worked out
But I'm gettin' over you now,
On a beach towel
With my shades on
My drink's up
And the sun's out
Huh! I'm somewhere on a beach!

I'm somewhere on a beach
Sipping something strong,
Got a new girl, she got it going on
We drink all day, and party all night
I'm way too gone to have you on my mind
She got a body and she's naughty,
And she got me like you ain't never got me
I'm getting sun, getting some, and I ain't slept in a week
Yeah, I'm somewhere on a beach.

Yeah, I'm somewhere on a beach.
