I've been trying to tell you
But you just won't learn
When you get down to trying it on
You get your fingers burned

You've been trying to tell me
That you know the game
Oh, but love ain't a game to play
Ain't that a shame, shame, shame

Well, you got the wrong impression
How to handle me
Cause it ain't quite as simple
As it seems to be

You gotta try it on
Before you take it home
Cause if you find it don't fit
Well, that's it

You gotta try it on (try it on)
Before you take it home
(Take it home)
Cause if you find it don't fit
Well, that's it

You've been trying
To show me that you know
But what I can't understand
Is you're all show, show, show

Don't you think you ought to
Get to know me before we go
Ooh, make a fool out of someone else
But don't let me know

Well, you got the wrong impression
How to handle me
Cause love ain't quite as simple
As it seems to be

You gotta try it on
Before you take it home
Cause if you find it don't fit
Well, that's it

You gotta try it on (try it on)
Before you take it home
(Take it home)
Cause if you find it don't fit
Well, if you find it don't fit
Well, if you find it don't fit
Well, that's it

Try it on, try it on, ooh

Try it on, try it on, ooh

Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You gotta try it on
(Try it on, try it on)
Before you take it home
(Try it on, try it on)
Cause if you find it don't fit, well

You gotta try it on
(Try it on, try it on)
Before you take it home
(Try it on, try it on)
Cause if you find it don't fit, well

You gotta try it on
(Try it on, try it on)
Before you take it home
(Try it on, try it on)
Cause if you find it don't fit, well...
