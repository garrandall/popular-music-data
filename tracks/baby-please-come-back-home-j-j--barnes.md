Ooh, baby
Baby, please come back home
Darling, please come back home
Cause I can't stand it
I just can't stand it

Broke your heart and I know
Misused your love, I did you wrong
I never thought I'd see the day
You'd get your coat and
Walk away (walk away)
But I'm sorry bout it, baby

Baby, please, oh, please
Come back home
Girl, I'll never treat you wrong
Baby, please, oh, please
Come back home
Girl, I'm about to blow my top
If this heartache, you don't stop

I hope my begging you will kill
The pain within I made you feel
(Made you feel, made you feel)
Once was blind but now I see
Girl, how much you mean to me
I'm so sorry bout that

Ooh, please, come back home
Girl, I'll never treat you wrong
Baby, please, oh, please
Come back home
Girl, I'm about to go insane
Anytime I hear your name, ooh, baby

(Mmm, baby, come back) ooh, babe
(Mmm, baby, come back)
Darling, please, come back home
(Mmm, baby, come back)
Wherever you may be, girl
Just come back home

(Mmm, baby, come back)
Hurry back to me, baby
Come back home
Cause I can't stand it
I can't stand it

Salty tears in my eyes
Oh, can't you see I apologize
(Apologize, apologize)
Those heartaches still made you go
Ooh, baby, I'll make them leave forever more
I said I was so sorry, baby

Another day has passed and gone
I find it hard to carry on
If she would only write me a simple letter
This would make me feel so much better

But until then
Baby, please come back
Girl, I'll never treat you wrong
Cause I can't stand it, darling
I can't stand it, baby
You left all alone, oh, baby
Baby, please...
