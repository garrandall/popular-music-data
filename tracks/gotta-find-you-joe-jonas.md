Every time I think I'm closer to the heart
What it means to know just who I am
I think I finally found a better place to start
No one ever seems to understand

I need to try to get to where you are
Could it be you're not that far?

You're the voice I hear inside my head 
The reason that I'm singing
I need to find you
I gotta find you
You're the missing piece I need 
The song inside of me
I need to find you
I gotta find you

You're the remedy I'm searching hard to find
To fix the puzzle that I see inside
Painting all my dreams the color of your smile
When I find you it will be alright

I need to try to get to where you are
Could it be you're not that far?

You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singing
I need to find you
I gotta find you
You're the missing piece I need
The song inside of me
I need to find you
I gotta find you

Been feeling lost
Can't find the words to say
Spending all my time stuck in yesterday
Where you are is where I wanna be
Oh, next to you, you next to me

I need to find you

You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singing
I need to find you (need to find you)
I gotta find you
You're the missing piece I need
The song inside of me
I need to find you
I gotta find you (I gotta find you)

You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singing
I need to find you (need to find you)
I gotta find you (gotta find you)
You're the missing piece I need
The song inside of me
I need to find you
I gotta find you

I gotta find you
