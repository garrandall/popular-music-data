Alone from night to night you'll find me
Thank you
Too weak to break these chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisoner
Don't let me be a prisoner
For one command I stand and wait now, no no no
From one who's master of my fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now

I'm just a prisoner
Don't let me be a prisoner

What's the good of my caring
If someone is sharing those arms
But not with me?
Although she has another
And I can't have another for I'm, I'm not free

She's in my dreams awake or sleeping, no no no
Upon my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life, my life, is in her keeping

I'm just a prisoner
Don't let me be a prisoner
(Prisoner of love)
You made me a prisoner
(Prisoner of love)
You made me love you
(Prisoner of love)
Said the night time was the right time
(Prisoner of love)
To be with the one you love
(Prisoner of love)
You made me a blind man
(Prisoner of love)
And I can't see, baby
(Prisoner of love)
You said you loved nobody, no no
(Prisoner of love)
And that is true to me
(Prisoner of love)
But oh no, no
(Prisoner of love)
NO
(Prisoner of love)
NO
(Prisoner of love)
NO
(Prisoner of love)
Prisoner of love
(Prisoner of love)
My face is wet
(Prisoner of love)
So wet with tears
(Prisoner of love)
You know I want you
(Prisoner of love)
I need you down through the years
(Prisoner of love)
My face is wet
(Prisoner of love)
So wet, you know
(Prisoner of love)
You got to hurt me, kiss me
(Prisoner of love)
And never, never never let me go
(Prisoner of love)
My face is wet
(Prisoner of love)
So wet with sweat
(Prisoner of love)
The way I love you
(Prisoner of love)
Do you know you never will forget?
(Prisoner of love)
My face is wet
(Prisoner of love)
My face is wet
(Prisoner of love)
My face is wet
(Prisoner of love)
My face is wet
(Prisoner of love)
Baby
(Prisoner of love)
Darling
(Prisoner of love)
Baby
(Prisoner of love)
NO
(Prisoner of love)
No
(Prisoner of love)
NO
(Prisoner of love)
No
(Prisoner of love)
NO
(Prisoner of love)
NO, NO, NO
(Prisoner of love)
Oh darling
(Prisoner of love)
Prisoner of love
(Prisoner of love)
Prisoner of love
(Prisoner of love)
Prisoner of love
(Prisoner of love)
Prisoner of love
(Prisoner of love)
Talk to me
(Prisoner of love)
Talk to me
(Prisoner of love)
Tell me, oh
(Prisoner of love)
You love me so
(Prisoner of love)
Talk to me
(Prisoner of love)
Baby, can't you see?
(Prisoner of love)
Darling, I
(Prisoner of love)
Darling, I
(Prisoner of love)
Darling, I
(Prisoner of love)
Darling, I
(Prisoner of love)
Oh, I
(Prisoner of love)
Darling, I
(Prisoner of love)
Darling, I
(Prisoner of love)
I love you so
(Prisoner of love)
Let them talk
(Prisoner of love)
If they want to
(Prisoner of love)
You know that I talk
(Prisoner of love)
I know, don't bother me
(Prisoner of love)
I know the gossip
(Prisoner of love)
Come from the devil's workshop
(Prisoner of love)
Do you know what I'm talking about?
(Prisoner of love)
Do you know what I'm talking about?
(Prisoner of love)
Do you know what I'm talking about?
(Prisoner of love)
They call it Stormy Monday
(Prisoner of love)
But Tuesday's just as bad
(Prisoner of love)
Wednesday's worse
(Prisoner of love)
And Thursdays are so sad
(Prisoner of love)
I never know
(Prisoner of love)
How much I love you
(Prisoner of love)
I never know
(Prisoner of love)
Just how much I care
(Prisoner of love)
When you put your arms around me
(Prisoner of love)
When you put your arms around me
(Prisoner of love)
When you put your arms around me
(Prisoner of love)
OH...NO!
