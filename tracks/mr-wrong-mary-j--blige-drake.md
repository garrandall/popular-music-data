Turn the lights on
Don't it seem like, like I'm always there when it matters
But missing most of the other time, a terrible pattern
The rewards I see from working made me an addict
There's way more people that want it than people that have it
I don't get it, I would hate to think I tricked 'em
They fall victim to my system, guess I sure know how to pick 'em
And I'm always her regret, yeah, I'm always her regret
And I always make it harder on whoever's coming next
It goes up and down, it's just up and down
She's crying now but she'll laugh again
'Cause we on the rise and she here with us
In expensive shit, just keeps happening
She loves it, she stares at me like who does this
And we hold hands while I pray that she's not the type to hold grudges
I'm wrong


Bad boys ain't no good
Good boys ain't no fun
Lord knows that I should
Run off with the right one

Me and Mr. Wrong get along so good (so good)
Even though he breaks my heart so bad (so bad)
We got a special thing going on
Me and Mr. Mr. Wrong
Even if I try, no, I never could
Give him up 'cause his love's like that
Ain't no way that I'm moving on
I love my Mr. Wrong

Hung up off your good
You call and I run
My family's screaming at me, "Don't do it
Don't do it Mary!"
I guess they never had none

Me and Mr. Wrong get along so good (so good)
Even though he breaks my heart so bad (so bad)
We got a special thing going on
Me and Mr. Mr. Wrong
Even if I try, no, I never could
Give him up 'cause his love's like that
Ain't no way that I'm moving on
I love my Mr. Wrong

When he put that loving on me
I can't think of nothing
That'll make me walk out
I'm holding on
I love my Mr. Wrong
He be kissing and touching on me
I can't help but love him
I must be out of my mind
For going so strong
I love my Mr. Wrong

Me and Mr. Wrong get along so good
Even though he breaks my heart so bad
We got a special thing going on
Me and Mr. Mr. Wrong
Even if I try, no, I never could
Give him up 'cause his love's like that
Ain't no way that I'm moving on
I love my Mr. Wrong

Mr. Wrong
