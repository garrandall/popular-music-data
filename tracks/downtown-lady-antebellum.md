Well, all the parties on the streets are talking, store front mannequins sleeping in lights.
We used to smoke while we were jaywalking like it was your birthday every other saturday night.
Knew The bands so we never payed our cover.
Wrote our names on the bathroom tiles.
We never dressed to impress all the others,
They would let us in on our laid back kind of style.
But boy you know it's been a while.

I don't know why you don't take me down town like you got anywhere better to be.
Talk it up and give me the go round, round like a good time tease.
I'm only counting on your cancellation,
When I should be counting on you at my door.
Did you forget about how we went around,
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore.
Ohhhhhhhh anymore.

I got some platforms sitting in the corner.
They wanna stroll on a city sidewalk.
I got a dress that'll show a little uh uh but you ain't gettin' uh uh if you don't come pick me up (damn),
Show me off (wow),
You might be tired, but I'm not!

And I don't know why you don't take me down town like you got anywhere better to be.
Talk it up and give me the go round, round like a good time tease.
I'm only counting on your cancellation,
When I should be counting on you at my door.
Did you forget about how we went around,
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore.

I don't know why you don't take me downtown like you got anywhere better to be.
Talk it up and give me the go round round like a good time tease.
I'm only counting on your cancellation,
When I should be countin on you at my door.
Did you forget about how we went around,
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore.
Ohhh anymore.
Yeaaaaah I don't know why you don't take me downtown,
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore.
I just don't get it
