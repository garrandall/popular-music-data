You've got to pay the price
Love don't come so easy
You've got to make every sacrifice
You've got to pay the price

Because sooner than your fashion
There is something hard to find
You might spend a lifetime trying
For that love's when you finally found
Someone you can build your life around

It's worth it to find a love that's true
And you'll best the pain
You been through

But you've got to pay the price
Love don't come so easy
You've got to make every sacrifice
You've got to pay the price

That means hurtings and remember
Going from one boy to another
Looking and finding
Finally you'll discover
That true love is confusion
And it might just be an illusion

Bad days when you're feeling blue
But lady luck smiles on a heart that's true

But you've got to pay the price
Love don't come so easy
You've got to make every sacrifice
You've got to pay the price
You've got to pay the price

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
You've got to pay the price
You've got to pay the price

You've got to pay the price
Love don't come so easy
You've got to make every sacrifice
You've got to pay the price

While you're looking for affection
Just be warned you've got to pay your dues
Here's some advice you might can use
Keep your eyes in one direction
'Til you make
The right connection

Somehow
Somewhere
One day
True love will find a way

But you've got to pay the price
Love don't come so easy
You've got to make every sacrifice
You've got to pay the price
You've got to pay the price
Can't get something for nothing
You've got to pay the price
Can't get something for nothing
