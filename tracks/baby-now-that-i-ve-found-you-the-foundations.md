Baby, now that I've found you, I can't let you go
I'll build my world around you, I need you so
Baby, even though you don't need me
You don't need me

Baby, now that I've found you, I can't let you go
I'll build my world around you, I need you so
Baby, even though you don't need me
You don't need me

Baby, baby, since first we met
I knew in this heart of mine, (I wanna tell you...)
The love we had could not be bad
Play it right and bide my time

Spent a lifetime looking for somebody
To give me love like you
Now you've told me that you wanna leave me
(Darling, I just can't let you)

Baby, now that I've found you, I can't let you go
I'll build my world around you, I need you so
Baby, even though you don't need me
You don't need me

Baby, now that I've found you, I can't let you go
I'll build my world around you, I need you so
Baby, even though you don't need me
You don't need me

Spent a lifetime looking for somebody
To give me love like you
Now you've told me that you wanna leave me
(Darling, I just can't let you)

Baby, now that I've found you, I can't let you go
I'll build my world around you, I need you so
Baby, even though you don't need me
You don't need me

Baby, now that I've found you, I can't let you go
I'll build my world around you, I need you so
Baby, even though you don't need me
