In the morning you go gunning
For the man who stole your water
Then you fire til he is done in
But they catch you at the border

And the mourners are all singing
As they drag you by your feet
But the hangman isn't hanging
And they catch you on the street

You go back, Jack, do it again
Wheel turning round and round
You go back, Jack, do it again

When you know she's no high climber
Then you find your only friend
In a room with your two timer
And you're sure you're near the end

Then you love a little wild one
And she brings you only sorrow
All the time you know she's smiling
You'll be on your knees tomorrow

Yeah, you go back, Jack, do it again
Wheel turning round and round
You go back, Jack, do it again

She says I am the one

Billy Jean's not my lover
Billy Jean's not my lover
Billy Jean's not my lover
Billy Jean's not my lover...
