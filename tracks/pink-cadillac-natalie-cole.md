You may think I'm fooling
For the foolish things I do
You may wonder how come I love you
When you get on my nerves like you do

Well baby, you know you bug me
There ain't no secret about that
Well, come on over here and hug me
And, baby, I'll spill the facts

Well, honey it ain't your money
'Cause I got plenty of that

I love you for your pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, peeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what you do 
There in the back of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac

Well, now way back in the Bible
Temptations always come along
There's always somebody tempting you
Somebody into doing something they know is wrong

Well, they tempt you, man, with silver 
And they tempt you, sir, with gold
And they tempt you with the pleasures 
That flesh does surely hold

They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple
Man, I ain't going for that

I know it was her pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, peeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what you're doing
In the back of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac

Now, now, now, some folks say it's too big 
And uses too much gas
Some folks say that it's too old
And that it just goes too fast

Ho, but love is bigger than a Honda (Honda)
And it's bigger than a Subaru (that, too)
Hey man there's only one thing
And one car that will do

Anyway we don't have to drive it 
Honey, we can park it out in back
And have a party in your pink Cadillac

Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, peeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what you do there
In the back of your pink Cadillac
You know the one I mean, Le Car
