Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans,
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens...
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood,
Where lived a country boy name of Johnny B. Goode...
Who never ever learned to read or write so well,
But he could play a guitar just like ringin' a bell.

Go Go
Go Johnny Go
Go
Go Johnny Go
Go
Go Johnny Go
Go
Go Johnny Go
Go
Johnny B. Goode

He use to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track.
Oh, the engineer would see him sitting in the shade,
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made.
People passing by, they would stop and say
Oh my but that little country boy could play

Go Go
Go Johnny Go
Go
Go Johnny Go
Go
Go Johnny Go
Go
Go Johnny Go
Go
Johnny B. Goode

His mother told him, "Someday you will be a man,
And you will be the leader of a big old band.
Many people comin' from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Sayin' Johnny B. Goode tonight."

Go Go
Go Johnny Go
Go Go Go
Johnny Go
Oh Go go
Johnny Go
Oh Go Go
Johnny Go
Go
Johnny B. Goode
