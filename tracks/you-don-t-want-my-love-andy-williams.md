In the summertime when all the trees and leaves are green
And the redbird sings, I'll be blue
'cause you don't want my love

"Some other time", that's whatcha say when I want you
Then you laugh at me and make me cry
'cause you don't want my love

You don't seem to care a thing about me
You'd rather live without me
Than to have my arms around you
When the nights are cold and you're so all alone (all alone)

In the summertime when all the trees and leaves are green
And the redbird sings, I'll be blue
'cause you don't want my love

Once upon a time you used to smile and wave to me
And walk with me but now you don't
'cause you don't want my love

Some other guy is takin' up all your time
Now ya don't have any time for me
'cause you don't want my love

You don't seem to care a thing about me
You'd rather live without me
Than to have my arms around you
When the nights are cold and you're so all alone (all alone)

In the summertime when all the trees and leaves are green
And the redbird sings, I'll be blue
'cause you don't want my love

In the summertime when all the trees and leaves are green
And the redbird sings, I'll be blue
'cause you don't want my love

(In summertime, in summertime when all the leaves are green)
In the summertime, I'll be blue all the time
'cause you don't want my love
