All night, these days, people are playing
Game ball off the wall with the head
The man promised me a raid (I said who?)
Who's gonna raid me when I'm dead?

Oh, I'm so tired of putting that clock every day (Working every day)
All day skatin' on thin ice
Lord knows we could use a holiday, baby
Just the two of us would be so nice

Gimme the bon
Gimme the bon, bon
Gimme the bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon vie
Gimme the good life (Give it to me)

Gimme the bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon vie
Oh, gimme the good life (Oho, baby)

(Heyeyeyey)

We were born and raised in New York City
Fell in love in Central Park
I really love New York City
Still number one in my heart

Sometimes I feel kind of strange in here (Dododododo)
Used that, abused and forgot
Sometimes I feel like no-one would really give a damn (Dododododo)
If I dropped dead right here on the spot

Gimme the bon (Hey, keep on, ce soir)
Gimme the bon, bon (Ce soir)
Gimme the bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon vie (Ce soir)
Gimme the good life

Gimme the bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon vie
Oh, gimme the good life (Oho, oho)

Do it
Dodobedodum
Dodobedodum

Let's go out, go into town tonight, pretty baby
Dance 'till the sun comes up
We'll have fun, carry on 'till our minds are blown
And put our last dime in that blind man's cup

Gimme the bon
Gimme the bon, bon
Gimme the bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon vie
Gimme the good life (Gimme the good life)

Gimme the bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon vie
Gimme the good life (Baby, oho, baby)
Bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon vie (Yeah, say it again)
Gimme the good life (Good life, good life)

Bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon vie
Gimme the good life (I said give it to me, give it to me, yeah)
Bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon vie
Gimme the good life (Good life, yeaheah)

Bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon vie
Gimme the good life (Yeah, give it to me)
Bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon vie
