I know that I could not survive
All alone in isolation
I got to get to my body heat
From the many people I know

I got to have a steady flow
Of voices and pretty faces
I stay in crowd places
'Cause I need the body heat

Gimme, gimme your body heat
Save me from the blizzard
Gimme, gimme your body heat
Save me from the cold

All I want is your body heat
To keep me from freezing
You can make me warm inside
If you give me your body heat

Something scares me every time
I'm alone in seclusion
I don't have no body heat
When I'm all by myself

I got to have a place to go
To get some embraces
And the speaker cranked up
Because I need my body heat

Gimme, gimme your body heat
Make me a fire
Gimme, gimme your body heat
Oh, save me now

All I want is your body heat
To keep me from freezing
You can make me warm inside
If you give me your body heat
You can make me warm inside
If you give me your body heat

Gimme, gimmbe body heat
Make me a fire
All I want is body heat
Save me from the cold

Gimme, gimme body heat
Make me, make me a fire
All I want is body heat
Save me from the cold, oh
Gimme, gimme body heat
Make me a fire

(Written by Alicia Bridges and Susan Hutcheson)
