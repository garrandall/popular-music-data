War war is stupid
and people are stupid
And love means nothin
in some strange quarters
War war is stupid
and people are stupid
And I heard them banging
on hearts and fingers
People fill the world
with narrow confidence
Like a child at birth
a man with no defence
What's mine's my own
I won't give it to you
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
Now we're fighting
in our hearts
Fighting in the streets
Won't somebody help me
Man is far behind
in the search for something new
Like a Philistine
we're burning witches too
This world of fate
must be designed for you
It matters what you say
it matters what you do
Now we're fighting
in our hearts
Fighting in the streets
Won't somebody help me
After the bird has flown
He walked ten thousand
miles back home
You can't do that to me, no
you can't do that to me
You can't do that to me, no, you can't do that to me
