I anchored my heart into the depths of this sea
With this ship made out of fears
Its crew plagued with the curse that comes with the daylight
And pours its black flood on me when the night arrives

On this sinking hearse I stand, made of bones, blood and horns
Sails of this ghost ship left at the mercy of these storms

I tore the demons out of me
But the night always brought them back
They painted my skin with their shadows
And cut me with their blades

I was drowned under their will
Until I knelt like a sheep under wolves' eyes
They made me stare straight into the fire
Until I heard all the cries of pain in the aether

But in the flame I saw myself burned alive
Burned alive with her

Please, save me Saint Peter!

On this sinking hearse I stand, made of bones, blood and horns
Sails of this ghost ship left at the mercy of these storms
Flags ripped apart by the winds that felt like thorns

No land, no home in sight
I am abandoned, abandoned by the light

The purest form of pain
My heart pulled apart by ebony horses
Unaware of their powers

Gentle in their calmness
Until their eyes lit up like the fires of Hell
Or was it just a reflection of mine?

On this sinking hearse I stand, made of bones, blood and horns
Sails of this ghost ship left at the mercy of these storms
Flags ripped apart by the winds that felt like thorns

No land, no home in sight
I am abandoned, abandoned by the light
