Girl, you're such a bad thing
Standing there all alone
Looking so good to me, baby
Can't do no wrong (Hey, baby)
Put your arms around me
Set my world on fire
There ain't never going to be nobody like you, baby
Honey, that's no lie (Hey, honey)


You put that spell on me
I'll tell you, honey
You know you set me free
Hey, little girl you know my heart's desires
Come on and give it to me, baby
I can't deny you
Hey, hey, what I'm saying is


Do it to me one more time
Oh, give you one more chance
This heart of mine
Do it to me one more time, baby
Can't get enough of your love


Oh, you're my Motown lover
(Motown lover)
Girl of my dreams
(Girl of my dreams)
When you laugh, when you cry
Girl, that look in your eyes
You're my everything, oh baby
Oh baby, oh hooo


You put that spell on me
I'll tell you, baby
You know you set me free
Oh, little girl you know my heart's on fire
I'm sayin' come do it to me, baby
It's you I desire
Hey, hey, what I'm saying is


Do it to me one more time
Oh, give you one more chance
This heart of mine
Do it to me one more time, baby
Can't get enough of your love
Can't get enough of your love


Whoa, oh, my friends say I'm a dreamer
It takes a fool in love
To know what I'm feeling
Each time you say goodbye
I find a reason why
To give us one more try
Knowing, knowing, baby
You're going to hurt me
Oh, oh oh yeah


Oh, do it to me one more time
Give you one more chance this heart of mine
Do it to me one more time, baby
Can't get enough of your love
Can't get enough of your love
Can't get enough of your love


Got this feeling deep inside me
There ain't nothing I can hide, baby
I just love the way you love me
Do it to me one more time, oh baby
(One more time)
Can't you see girl, that I need you
All I want to do is please you
Even though it's hard to love you
Do it to me one more time, oh yeah
(One more time)
When you move, girl, you tease me
We make love slow and easy
I just want you here beside me
Do it to me one more time
Do it, do it, baby
