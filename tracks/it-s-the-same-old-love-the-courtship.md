I don't bring you flowers every day
Say 'I love you' in the usual way
No, I don't come a-calling
(Don't come a-calling)
Those ways have moved on
It's a changing world, babe
And those days are gone

Still, it's the same old love
Darling, it's the same old butterflies
Yes, it's the same old stardust in my eyes
Still, it's the same old love
Darling, it's the same old games we play
Just the same as yesterday
It's that same old love a brand new way

I don't take you strolling down the lane
Or quote you lines from an old refrain
There's no vine covered cottage
(Vine covered cottage)
For us to dream about
Yet when we're all alone
And all the lights are out

Still, it's the same old love
Darling, it's the same old butterflies
Yes, it's the same old stardust in my eyes
Still, it's the same old love
Darling, it's the same old games we play
Just the same as yesterday
It's that same old love a brand new way

Still, it's the same old love
Darling, it's the same old love
Darling, darling, darling, it's the love
It's the same old love
It's that same old love
Still, it's the same old love
Still, it's the same old love
Still, it's the same old love
