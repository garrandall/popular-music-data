Today's the day, we're out to play 
And lost our way, it's always the same - oh baby now 
Climbed the trees, swan the seven seas 
We've grazed our knees and no-one's to blame 

Come and sit beside us 
We'll give you such a thrill 
We're not nice we're cool as ice 
We'll give you quite a chill 
Let your imagination take over on this ride 
Out of sight - all right 
(Hold on tight) 

Come on 
Come on 
Get it on 
Riding in our rollercoaster 
Come on 
Come along 
Get it on 
Riding in our rollercoaster of love 

So don't be shy 
You'll soon be high 
We'll touch the sky 
You'll never believe oh baby now 
Go round and round 
But don't look down 
We won't be found 
You'd better believe it
