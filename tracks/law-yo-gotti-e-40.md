Don't fuck no bitch that's fucking with your dawg, that's law
If you come up don't forget about your dawgs, that's law
I'm a street nigga so its fuck the law
If you broke nigga that should be against the law
Fuck no bitch that's fucking with your dawg, that's law
If you come up don't forget about your dawgs, that's law
I'm a street nigga so its fuck the law
If you broke nigga that should be against the law


I'm a real hustler so don't knock it, that's law
It's all about the re-up and the profit, that's law
Can't be in the club without no bottles, that's law
We gon' ball today fuck tomorrow, that's law
I be in the kitchen whipping trying to cook the sauce
If you sat down to talk, then nigga you the law
Balmain mannequin I'm fresher than a doll
Look so damn fresh that shit should be against the law
I'm living my life like the rules of the game and they calling the 48 laws
Money with money with all of my homies ain't fucking with none of these broads
Hustling just to show out for these bitches you lost
In love but you ain't never got the pussy you off
Head on first night we need to turn that to a law
Love on first sight, man I don't fuck with that at all
Bitches can't be beefing 'bout no niggas, that's law
Niggas shouldn't be beefing over bitches, that's soft


Don't fuck no bitch that's fucking with your dawg, that's law
If you come up don't forget about your dawgs, that's law
I'm a street nigga so its fuck the law
If you broke nigga that should be against the law
Fuck no bitch that's fucking with your dawg, that's law
If you come up don't forget about your dawgs, that's law
I'm a street nigga so its fuck the law
If you broke nigga that should be against the law


Gossiping ass nigga, news reporter
Working with them folks, you on Law & Order
If your girl getting it, then you must support her
I'm turnt up and I'm trying to fuck somebody daughter
Piecing up on bottles boy don't let me find out
Don't let me find out, don't let me find out
Them your homegirl's shoes, bitch don't let me find out
Don't let me find out, don't let me find out
Trying to steal my swag that copyright infringement
You can't rock all white if your white be looking dingy
The brokest bitches always trying to say they independent
I'm picking real bitches over bad bitches do you feel me


Don't fuck no bitch that's fucking with your dawg, that's law
If you come up don't forget about your dawgs, that's law
I'm a street nigga so its fuck the law
If you broke nigga that should be against the law
I'm a real hustler so don't knock it, that's law
It's all about the re-up and the profit, that's law
Can't be in the club without no bottles, that's law
We gon' ball today fuck tomorrow, that's law


Paper over plastic P.O.P, that's law
Cash on delivery C.O.D, that's law
Hush your mouth some time and let them teach ya, that's law
Never bite the hand of the man that feed ya, that's law
Don't forget who buttered your bread don't get amnesia, that's law
Sleep with one eye closed, no back door you ain't sneaky, that's law
Know your bail bondsman and your lawyer number by heart, that's law
Interrogation keep your tongue in park, that's law
You pushing a line, I'm pushing a line
You packing a nine, I'm packing a nine
Your bitch is a dime, my bitch is a dime
She curvy and fine, she curvy and fine
You halving your bread, I'm halving my dough
You selling them O's, I rap and do shows
You powder your nose, I only do dro
Mendicino, you know how it go
Got to play the game of life the game of death, that's law
Don't be no bitch don't stir up hella mess, that's law
He praying on his paper didn't pray, that's law
Died with two guns in hand from the AK, that's law


Don't fuck no bitch that's fucking with your dawg, that's law
If you come up don't forget about your dawgs, that's law
I'm a street nigga so its fuck the law
If you broke nigga that should be against the law
I'm a real hustler so don't knock it, that's law
It's all about the re-up and the profit, that's law
Can't be in the club without no bottles, that's law
We gon' ball today fuck tomorrow, that's law
