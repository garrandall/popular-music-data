(And it's hard enough to make the same mistakes)
(And it's hard enough to make the same mistakes)

Little pockets of ignorance
He leaves the plastic on the seat of his car
And there's a plague around you

I think this time I'm being pushed a little too hard
Are you sure there hasn't been some sort of mistake?
Are you sure there hasn't been some sort of mistake?
Are you sure there hasn't been some sort of mistake?
Are you sure there hasn't been some sort of mistake?

You think you've got the gift of second sight
Because you argue better doesn't mean you're always right
I've known him all my life
This innocent man lost my respect years ago

Are you sure there hasn't been some sort of mistake?
Are you sure there hasn't been some sort of mistake?
Are you sure there hasn't been some sort of mistake?
Are you sure there hasn't been some sort of mistake?

And it's hard enough to make the same mistake
And it's hard enough to make the some mistake

Little pockets of ignorance
I wouldn't have believed he was the one you were searching for
I mean I've known him all my life
This innocent man lost my respect years ago

Are you sure there hasn't been some sort of mistake?

(And it's hard enough to make the some mistake)
(And it's hard enough to make the same mistake)

(The man who knew too much... Are you sure?)
Stands alone I confess
(The man who knew too much... Are you sure?)
Are you sure? I'm not sure
