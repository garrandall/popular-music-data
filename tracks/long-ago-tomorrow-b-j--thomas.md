Maybe I'll be the things I dream 
And not the things I seem 
Maybe I'll get to change the world 
Before it changes me 
And maybe my life 
Will always be 
Just as happy as it seems 
Long ago tomorrow 
Long ago tomorrow 
Long ago tomorrow 

In my dreams 
Maybe I'll learn to face the truth 
And like the truth I face 
Maybe I'll get to find myself 
Before I'm lost in space 
And maybe a love 
Will always be 
Just as faithful as it seems 
Long ago tomorrow 
Long ago tomorrow 
Long ago tomorrow 

In my dreams 
And maybe a love 
Will always be 
Just as faithful as it seems 
Long ago tomorrow 
Long ago tomorrow 
In my dreams.
