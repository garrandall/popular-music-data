I could fall in love with the proper stranger
If I heard the bells and the banjos ring
If two certain eyes with the look of danger
Smiled a welcome warm as spring

If the beating in my heart
Sounded out a warning
Don't let her
Don't let her walk through the door
This is the one you've been waiting for
Oh, yes, I'd know
However wild it seems
You know I'd know

And I'd whisper
Come take my hand, proper stranger
Don't go through life as a stranger
For I'm a poor proper stranger, too

Don't let her
Don't let her walk through the door
This is the one you've been waiting for
Oh, yes, I'd know
However wild it seems
You know I'd know

And I'd whisper
Come take my hand, proper stranger
Don't go through life as a stranger
For I'm a poor proper stranger, too
