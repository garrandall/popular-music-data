I don't know how to say goodbye
I'm trying not to cry
We were so special
Can you remember

But I don't believe in holding on
Can love like this be wrong
My heart is breaking
Watching you walk away from me
Is this the way good bye's supposed to be
(I will be your shelter)

(When the rain begins to fall)
(You wake up and he's gone)
In spite of heartbreak
Love lives after all

(When there's nowhere else to run)
(And you've all but given up)
And when there's no one left to care
Just believe in love and I'll be there

(Oh... oh.. ooh)
(I'll be there, yes, I will)

And now with all the sacrifice
My thoughts of you
From night fall to the sunrise (To the sunrise)
There'd be days when I'd cry

Knowing that it's useless to resist
(Can love be more than this)
I prayed forever (Forever and ever)
And forever is a long time to believe
That there'd be one more chance for you and me
(I will be your shelter)

(When the rain begins to fall)
(You wake up and he's gone)
In spite of heartbreak
Love lives after all

(When there's nowhere else to run)
(And you've all but given up)
And when there's no one left to care
Just believe in love and I'll be there

I'm just a telephone call away
You can call me any day
And when there's no one left to care
Just believe in love and I'll be there
