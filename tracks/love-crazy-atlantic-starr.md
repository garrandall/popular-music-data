I'm love, love crazy
Crazy over you
I'm love, love crazy
I'm helpless
There's nothing I can do

Cupid, he must have
Shot me with his arrow
When I first saw your face
Cause I, I been floating
On a cloud ever since
Girl, I'm just a hopeless case

The first time that I held you
I knew that it was just
A matter of time before
I did what comes naturally when
A pretty girl blows your mind

I think about you
In the middle of the day
Thinking how much I love you
And if everything's okay

Can't wait to hug you
And squeeze you, oh, so tight
Then make such good love to you
You'll be hanging on for dear life

I'm love, love crazy
Crazy over you
I'm love, love crazy
I'm helpless and
There's nothing I can do

You bring me all
The joys I possess
You make me feel alive
Well, well, they say man
Can't live by bread alone
You're the reason I survive

Whenever times get
Dark and cloudy
You make my gray skies blue
And whenever I fell
You're always there
To bring me up
I can always count on you

No one else has made me
Feel the heat of the battle
Nothing I can say or do
I could the wild thing
Twenty-four hours a day
That's the way it is
When I'm with you

I'm love, love crazy
Love crazy, baby
Crazy over you
I'm love, love
Love crazy, oh
There's nothing I can do

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Love, l-o-v-e, love

Love me til you're, girl
You got me going crazy
You got me doing freaky things
Just thinking about you

I can't stand it, girl
When I'm all alone
Without you, without you, girl

I can't stand
I'm going crazy
I want you to move in
With me, baby

Love crazy
I'll sure give it to you
I'll sure give it to you
I'll sure give it to you

Love crazy
Get it, baby
Cause I love you true
You got me going crazy

Drive me crazy
Drive me crazy
I got so much love
To give to you now

I got so much love
For you, baby...
