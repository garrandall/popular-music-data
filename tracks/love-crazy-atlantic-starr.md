I want your love, your sweet love
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do...
I want your love, your precious love
Ooh, it's all I ever think of

I got a crave for something warm and tender
Developing a thirst for something wet and wild
Something that forever could hold my attention, yeah
Something that is, oh, so soft and mild

I know you're wondering
What I'm trying to say
And where I'm comin' from
Well, I want you to know
It's comin' from my mind
I fantasize about you
I live and touch and taste you, baby

I want your love, your sweet love
Come bring it to me, baby, yeah
I want your love, your precious love
It's all I ever think of

Crazy is this feeling
That I've got about you, girl, yeah
It's no lightweight feeling, baby
It's for real, oh, yes it is
Ooh, the way you feed my imagination, ooh...
If love could be stolen
Your love I would steal, yes I would

Ooh, baby, I know you're wondering
What I'm trying to say
And where I'm comin' from
Well, I want you to know
It's comin' from my mind
I fantasize about you
I live and touch and taste you, baby

I want your love, your sweet love
Come bring it to me, baby
And I, I want your love, your precious love
It's all I ever think of

Yeah, give me your love

I know you're wondering
What I'm trying to say, yeah
And where I'm comin' from
Well, I want you to know
It's comin' from my mind
I fantasize about you
I live and touch and taste you, baby

I want your love, your sweet love
I want your love, your precious love
(I, ooh-ooh...)
It's all I ever think of
Ooh, baby, yeah

Crazy 'bout your love
Crazy, crazy, crazy
Crazy 'bout your love, love, yeah
Crazy 'bout your love
Late at night, sometimes I sit up
And I, I think about what your love
Might feel like, baby
Crazy 'bout your love
I can feel it, your love
I can touch it
I can taste it...
