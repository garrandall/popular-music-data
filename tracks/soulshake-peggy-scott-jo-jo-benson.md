Dancing with you baby
Really turns the soulshake on
Yeah, groovin' with you baby
Really turns that soulshake on
I'm a woman possessed by the way you move
Ain't nothing 'bout you baby
That I don't approve
Come on, come on baby
Let's pour the soulshake on

Well this dance floor is lookin'
Like a great big honeycomb
And all the bees inside
Are really swarming and digging the song
I'm your king bee baby
Buzzin' in this house
Well buzz on baby
Let's look alive, let's do it together
Let's pour the soulshake on

Well there ain't nobody else
In the whole wide world like you
No, no, no, nobody else
Can turn me on baby like you do
When your soul light shines
I nearly flip my mind
And when you do it, do it baby
It's fine, so fine
Groovin' with you baby
Really turns the soulshake on
