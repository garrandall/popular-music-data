I have heard the wild bird's sing
So I know what "freedom" is
I have looked into the eyes of a child
So I know what "faith" is
I have seen a rainbow
So I know what "beauty" is
I have planted a tree
So I know what "hope" is
I have held a helping hand
So I know what "kindness" is
I have seen a blossom burst into bloom
So I know what "glory" is
I have lost a friend
So I know what "sorrow" is
I have knelt down in prayer
So I know what "peace" is
I have seen a mother at her crib
So I'm sure of the meaning of "love"
I have seen and I have felt these things
And now I know what "God" is!
