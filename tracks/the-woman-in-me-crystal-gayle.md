Seems to me, no matter what I do
I picked the wrong time to do it
In a minute, I will be all right
If you will let think it through

I could comb my hair and
Walk right out of here so fast
Let the silence tell you that
I've grown up at las&116

You'll never break in woman in me
Though you might break the smile
You'll never hurt the woman in me
But you might hurt the child

Can I help it if it feels good
To have your arms wrapped around me
When you touch me, I'm a little girl
And there's so much that I still need

Give me room to touch my own heart
I'm not so weak
I could fly away and leave you
With a kiss on the cheek

You'll never break in woman in me
Though you might break the smile
You'll never hurt the woman in me
But you might hurt the child

You'll never break in woman in me
Though you might break the smile
You'll never hurt the woman in me
But you might hurt the child
