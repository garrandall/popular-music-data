Sometimes it feels like
We lack communication
I know you feel like
You need a long vacation
When you've had enough
And you say this isn't love
You know it ain't true
(I've heard it all before)
I know it too
(Not worried anymore)
Don't talk - we can touch
Don't talk 'cause words never can say enough
Do what you want but
Don't talk - I'd rather we touch
Don't say anymore, we've already said enough
Do what you want but don't talk
I never mastered
The art of conversation
So you'll just have to
Use your imagination
I know you won't mind
When we make up one more time
We've been thru a lot
(We've shared it all together)
So we gotta stop
(It's better late than never)
Don't talk
We can touch
Don't talk 'cause words never can say enough
Do what you want but
Don't talk
We're staring at the ceiling
Conceal our thoughts, our feelings
Now all that's left to do is
Show my love for you so
Don't talk
We can touch
Don't talk 'cause words never can say enough
Do what you want but
Don't talk
I'd rather we touch
Don't say anymore, we've already said enough
Do what you want but
Don't talk,
We can touch
Don't talk 'cause words can never say enough
Don't talk
