What, what about your friends?
What about
What about your friends?
What about your
What about your
What about your


Every now and then, I get a little crazy
That's not the way it's supposed to be
Sometimes my vision is a little hazy
I can't tell who I should trust or just who I let trust me, yeah
People try to say I act a little funny
But that's just a figure of speech to me
They tell me I changed because I got money
But if you were there before, then you're still down with me, yeah


What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down again?
What about your friends?
Are they gonna be low down?
Will they ever be around?
Or will they turn their backs on you?


Well, is it me, or can it be I'm a little too
Friendly so to speak hypothetically say?
I supply creativity to what others
Must take as a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy
Which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just 'cause I am what some choose to envy


Every now and then, I get a little easy
I let a lot of people depend on me
I never thought they would ever deceive me
Don't you know when times got rough
I was standing on my own
I'll never let another get that close to me
You see, I've grown a lot smarter now
Sometimes you have to choose and then you'll see
If your friend is true, they'll be there with you
Through the thick and thin


What about your friends? (What about your friends?)
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down again? (Woah)
What about your friends? (What about your friends?)
Are they gonna be low down (Be low down)
Will they ever be around? (Be around)
Or will they turn their backs on you?
What about your friends? (What about your friends?)
Will they stand their ground? (Stand their ground)
Will they let you down again? (Oh)
What about your friends? (What about your friends?)
Are they gonna be low down (Be low down)
Will they ever be around? (Be around)
Or will they turn their backs on you?


Yo, is it me? Here we go
Or can it be I am a little too friendly?
So to speak hypothetically say?
I supply creativity to what others must take as a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy, which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just cause I am what some choose to envy


What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down again?
What about your friends? (What about your friends?)
Are they gonna be low down?
Will they ever be around? (Be around)
Or will they turn their backs on you?
What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down again?
What about your friends? (What about your friends?)
Are they gonna be low down? (Be low down)
Will they ever be around? (Be around)
Or will they turn their backs on you?


People say I act a little funny
I wouldn't change not for no money
I'll be a friend as long as you're a friend to me
Yeah, yeah (What about your friends?)
Even though I might be easy
It don't give you no cause to deceive me
It's not the way that I want my friends to ever be


What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down again?
What about your friends? (What about your friends?)
Are they gonna be low down? (Be low down)
Will they ever be around? (Will they ever be around)
Or will they turn their backs on you? (Or will they turn their backs on you?)
What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground? (Stand their ground)
Will they let you down again?
What about your friends?
