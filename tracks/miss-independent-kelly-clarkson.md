Miss Independent
Miss Self-Sufficient
Miss Keep-Your-Distance

Miss Unafraid
Miss Out-Of-My-Way
Miss Don't-Let-A-Man-Interfere, no

Miss On-Her-Own
Miss Almost-Grown
Miss Never-Let-A-Man-Help-Her-Off-Her-Throne

So, by keeping her heart protected
She'd never ever feel rejected
Little Miss Apprehensive
Said oh, she fell in love

What is the feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open my door
Surprise it's time
To feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you
When love is true

Misguided heart
Miss Play-It-Smart
Miss If-You-Want-To-Use-That-Line-You-Better-Not-Start, no

But she miscalculated
She didn't want to end up jaded
And this miss decided not to miss out on true love

So, by changing her misconceptions
She went in a new direction
And found inside she felt a connection
She fell in love

What is the feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open my door (open this door)
Surprise it's time
To feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye (goodbye), old you (old you)
When love, when love is true

When Miss Independence walked away
No time for love that came her way
She looked in the mirror and thought today
What happened to Miss No-Longer-Afraid?

It took some time for her to see
How beautiful love could truly be
No more talk of why can't that be me
I'm so glad I finally see

What is the feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open my door
Surprise (surprise), it's time
To feel (to feel) what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye (goodbye), old you
When love, when love is true

Miss Independent
