New dance, it's an old dance come back again
Run, go tell your friend, it's a brand new design!
Watch the girl, them babblin', whinin', when they whinin', make sure them no brought them waist line
Lord, have mercy, I'd go!

Man, you know what really drive me crazy
Man, you know what really drives me mad
'Cause seeing a whiney, whiney girl, it does roll in my tum
It makes a rum-pum-pum-pum-brooo, boys, feel glad, come for 'em in a man (give it all)

You just just jiggle and a wiggle and a jiggle and a wiggle, and move them body
Then does a whine and go down, because them know them sexy
Said the new style come, man, in the runway country
In Los Angeles, Miami or New York City, so listen

Man, you know what really drive me crazy
Man, you know what really drives me mad
It's to watch the whiney, whiney girls roll in my tum
It makes a rum-pum-pum-pum-brooo, boys, feel glad, watch me now

Them put them shoulders in, they put their bumper out
They put the and then, them whine all about
And then, they'll do the whiney, whiney and I'll jump and I'll shout
And me say "that's what it's all about", come for 'em in a man



It just all bounce and a dip and bounce and a dip and whine off your whip
You're just tight, baby, and get a good grip
'Cause when the are whining, you know I'm fully equip
And if you're flip, you're my flop, and you're flop, you're my flip, so listen
(what are ya sayin'?)

Girl, you got me whiney now
You got me whiney like I never before (come for 'em in one and two)
And yeah, you really whiney now
You whiney, tell ya about 'til me touch the floor

Whiney, whiney,
You're whiney, whiney
You're whiney, whiney
All the nice and thin and fat body girls, bueno!

Hey!
Push it up, girl
'Cause it's all good

Let me say man, you know what really drive me crazy
Man, you know what really makes me mad
It's to watch the whiney, whiney women roll in my tum
It makes a rum-pum-pum-pum-brooo, boys, feel glad, come for 'em in a man

Them put them shoulders in, they put their bumper out
They put the , and then, them whine all about
And then, they'll do the whiney, whiney and I'll jump and I'll shout
And me say "that's what it's all about", come for 'em in a man

You just just jiggle and a wiggle and a jiggle and a wiggle, and roll your belly
Said the new style come, man, in the runway country
So girl, just bring your Vodka and just roll your belly
In Miami, Las Vegas or in New York City

All of them bouncin', all of them movin', all of them gettin' the move
All of them love the new style, 'cause it's new and improved
Some of them short, and some of them slim, and some of them round like??????
Some of them very very ugly, but you're good lookin'

So me say man, you know what really drive me crazy
Man, you know what really makes me mad
It's to watch the whiney, whiney girls roll in my tum
It makes a rum-pum-pum-pum-brooo, boys, feel glad



Whiney, whiney
You're whiney, whiney
You're whiney, whiney
