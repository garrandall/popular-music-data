I feel a little sad today
My head's on fire and we trashed the place
Tears of frustration stain the way
Like maps of the pain that are on your face
Take our cat and you're leaving home
Stepping on the glass where our picture broke
You won't tell me where you'll go
Said I had my chance, ain't love no more

Talk about being afraid
Thinking to myself it was my mistake
I'm really bad at letting go
I let you go, go
Deep down you're just as bad
Never broke down, told me you're sad
Just waited till it's too late
It's too late

What do you want me to say?
My heart is choked and my head hangs low
But I guess you feel like I don't care
'Cause I said nothing, nothing
I said nothing
What do you want me to do?
Tell you how I feel or just let you go?
I fucked it up and everything's my fault
'Cause I said nothing, nothing
I said nothing

Phone lights up, it's late at night
It's just you telling me I'm dead inside
Wish I could say how much it hurt
Open my mouth but it don't work
I built these walls that I'm living in
Now I can't breathe and they're caving in
Found this dark place on my own
Now I'm livin' here all alone

Talk about being afraid
Thinking to myself it was my mistake
I'm really bad at letting go
I let you go, go
Deep down you're just as bad
Never broke down, told me you're sad
Just waited till it's too late
It's too late

What do you want me to say?
My heart is choked and my head hangs low
But I guess you feel like I don't care
'Cause I said nothing, nothing
I said nothing
What do you want me to do?
Tell you how I feel or just let you go?
I fucked it up and everything's my fault
'Cause I said nothing, nothing
I said nothing

Talk about moving on
You seem okay, but I'm so lost
Shoulda fought for us and not regret
So why did I just say nothing then?

What do you want me to say?
My heart is choked and my head hangs low
But I guess you feel like I don't care
'Cause I said nothing, nothing
I said nothing
What do you want me to do?
Tell you how I feel or just let you go?
I fucked it up and everything's my fault
'Cause I said nothing, nothing
I said nothing
