When I first saw you standing there
You know, it was a little hard not to stare
So nervous when I drove you home
I know being apart's a little hard to bear

Sent some flowers to your work in hopes
That I will have you in my arms again
We kissed that night before I left
Still now that's something
I could never forget

You've got all that I need
Looking at all or nothing
Babe it's you and I
With you I know that
I'm good for something
So let's go and give it a try
We've got our backs against the ocean
It's just us against the world
Looking at all or nothing
Babe it's you and I
Looking at all or nothing
Babe it's you and I

Let's take a chance go far away today
And never look back again
Since I said I loved you in Las Vegas
It's never been the same since then

You've got all that I need
Looking at all or nothing
Babe it's you and I

With you I know that
I'm good for something
So let's go and give it a try
We've got our backs against the ocean
It's just us against the world
Looking at all or nothing
Babe it's you and I
Looking at all or nothing
Babe it's you and I

This is it nothing to hide
One more kiss never say goodbye
This is it baby, you're all mine
Looking at all or nothing
Babe it's you and I
I know that I'm good for something
So let's go and give it a try
We've got our backs against the ocean
It's just us against the world
Looking at all or nothing
Babe it's you and I
With you I know that
I'm good for something
So let's go and give it a try

We've got our backs against the ocean
It's just us against the world
Looking at all or nothing
Babe it's you and I
Looking at all or nothing
Babe it's you and I
Babe it's you and I
