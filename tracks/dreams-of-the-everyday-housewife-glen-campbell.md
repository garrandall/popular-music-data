She looks in the mirror
And stares at the wrinkles that
Weren't there yesterday
And thinks of the young man
That she almost married
What would he think
If he saw her this way?
She picks up her apron
In little girl fashion
As something comes into her mind
Then slowly starts dancing
Remembering her girlhood
And all of the boys
She had waiting in line


Ah such are the dreams
Of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere anytime of the day
An everyday housewife
Who gave up the good life for me


The photograph album
She takes from the closet
And slowly turns the page
And carefully picks up
The crumbling flower
The first one he gave her
Now withered with age
She closes her eyes
And touches the house dress that
Suddenly disappears
And just for a moment
She's wearing the gown
That broke all their minds
Back so many years


Ah such are the dreams
Of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere anytime of the day
An everyday housewife
Who gave up the good life for me


Ah such are the dreams
Of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere anytime of the day
An everyday housewife
Who gave up the good life for me


Ah such are the dreams
Of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere...
