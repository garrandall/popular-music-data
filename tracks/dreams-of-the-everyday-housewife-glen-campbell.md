She looks in the mirror and stares at the wrinkles that weren't there yesterday
And thinks of the young man that she almost married
What would he think if he saw her this way?

She holds up her apron in little girl fashion as something comes into her mind
And slowly starts dancing remembering her girlhood
And all of the boys she had waiting in line

Ah, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere, anytime of the day
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me

The photograph album she takes from the closet and slowly turns the first page
And carefully picks up the crumbling flower
The first one he gave her now withered with age
She closes her eyes and touches the house dress that suddenly disappears
And just for that moment she's wearing the gown
That broke all their minds back so many years

Ah, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere, anytime of the day
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me
