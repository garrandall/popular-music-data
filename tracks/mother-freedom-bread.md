Freedom, keep walkin'
Keep on your toesand don't stop talkin' 'bout
Freedom, get goin'
Lots to be learned and lots to be known 'bout
People gotta reach 'em
Sit 'em right down and then you gotta teach 'em 'bout
Freedom, gotta win it
Gotta put yourself smack dab in it

Hey tomorrow
Now don't you go away
'Cause freedom
Just might come your way

Freedom, keep tryin'
People stay alive and people keep dyin' for
Freedom, so don't lose it
Ya gotta understand ya just can't abuse it
Freedom, get movin'
Never gonna stop till everybody's groovin' on
Love for - one another
Callin' some friend and callin' some brother

Hey tomorrow
You're not so far away
Mother freedom
We'll know you well someday
