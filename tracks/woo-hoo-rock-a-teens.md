Standing all alone here, in a tavern full of ghosts
It's 3am, we're back again, here's my toast...
The first one, goes to rock n' roll, the fortune and the fame
The limousines, the screaming teens, that yell our name
I came here to get wasted, but it just ain't the same

I'm raising my glass and tossing it back, but I can't remember why...
So let's have another for all of my brothers, who drank until they died
My dead drunk friends (woo hoo!)
(woo hoo!)
My dead drunk friends (woo hoo!)

Here's to all the women, the widows and the brides
The ones that we came home to, the ones we had to hide
The next one's to the road boys, and all the crap we tried
We thought we were immortal, and then YOU DIED!
I've been feeling kind of lonely, so I came here to get fried

I'm raising my glass and tossing it back, but I can't remember why...
So let's have another for all of my brothers, who drank until they died
I'm raising my glass and tossing it back, but I can't remember why...
So let's have another for all of my brothers, who drank until they died
Drank until they died
My dead drunk friends

We drink and we fight
And we fight and we puke
And we puke and we fight and we drink

We puke and we puke
And we drink and we fight
And we fight and we puke and we drink

OR...

We drink and we puke
And we fight and we fight
And we drink and we puke and we puke

We drink and we fight
And we puke and we puke
And then we DIE

My dead DRUNK friends

I'm raising my glass and tossing it back, but I can't remember why...
So let's have another for all of my brothers, who drank until they died
I'm raising my glass and tossing it back, but I can't remember why...
So let's have another for all of my brothers, who drank until they died
Drank until they died
Drank until they died

My dead drunk friends
