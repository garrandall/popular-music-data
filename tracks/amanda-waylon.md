I've held it all inward, God knows, I've tried,
But it's an awful awakening in a country boy's life,
To look in the mirror in total surprise.
At the hair on my shoulders and the age in my eyes. 

Amanda, light of my life.
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife.
Amanda, light of my life. 
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife.

It's a measure of people who don't understand,
The pleasures of life in a hillbilly band.
I got my first guitar when I was fourteen, 
Well I finally made forty, still wearing jeans.

Amanda, light of my life.
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife.
Amanda, light of my life. 
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife.
