Ooooh, Ooooh

Uptown girl
She's been livin' in her uptown world
I bet she never had a backstreet guy
I bet her mama never told her why
I'm gonna try for an

Uptown girl
She's been livin' in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am

And when she knows what she wants
from her time
And when she wakes up 
and makes up her mind
She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because 
I'm in love with an

Uptown girl
You know I've seen her in her uptown world
She's getting tired of her high-class toys
And all her presents from her uptown boys
She's got a choice

Oooooooooooooooh 

Uptown girl
Y'know I can't afford to buy her pearls
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
And then I'll win

And when she's walkin'
she's lookin' so fine
And when she's talkin'
she'll say that she's mine
She'll say I'm not so tough
Just because 
I'm in love with an

Uptown girl
She's been livin' in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am

Oooooooooooooooh 

Uptown girl
She's my uptown girl
You know I'm in love with an
Uptown girl
She's my uptown girl
You know I'm in love

With an uptown girl
