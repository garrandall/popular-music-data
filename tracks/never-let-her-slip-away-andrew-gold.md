I talked to my baby on the telephone
Long distance
I never would've guessed
I could miss someone so bad, yeah
I really only met her 'bout a week ago
But it doesn't seem to matter to my heart
I know that I love her
I'm hoping that I never recover
Cause she's good for me
And it would really make me happy
To never let her slip away

I feel like a kid with a teenage crush
On a school date
I feel like the lead in "Romeo & Juliet"
I'm a little bit dizzy, I'm a little bit scared
I guess I never felt this much aware
That I'd love her
I'm hoping that I'll never recover
Cause she's good for me
And it would really make me happy
To never let her slip away

Never, never, never let her slip away

I really only met her 'bout a week ago
But it doesn't seem to matter to my heart
I know that I love her
I'm hoping that I never recover
Cause she's good for me
And it would really make me happy
To never let her slip away

Mmm... I love her
I'm hoping that I never recover, oh
Cause she's good for me
And it would really make me happy
To never let her slip away
Oh, I know it's gonna make me happy
To never let her slip away...
