I talked to my baby on the telephone long distance
I never would've guessed I could miss someone so bad, yeah
I really only met her 'bout a week ago
But it doesn't seem to matter to my heart
I know that I love her
I'm hoping that I never recover
'Cause she's good for me
And it would really make me happy
To never let her slip away

I feel like a kid with a teenage crush on a school day
(On a school day afternoon)
I feel like the lead in "Romeo and Juliet", yeah
I'm a little bit dizzy, I'm a little bit scared
I guess I never felt this much aware
That I love her
I'm hoping that I never recover
'Cause she's good for me
And it would really make me happy
To never let her slip away

I really only met her 'bout a week ago
But it doesn't seem to matter to my heart
I know that I love her
I'm hoping that I never recover
Yeah, she's good to me
And it would really make me happy
To never let her slip away

Mm, I love her
I'm thinking that I never recover
Yeah, she's good for me
I know it's gonna make me happy
To never let her slip away
Oh, I know it's gonna make me happy
To never let her slip away
