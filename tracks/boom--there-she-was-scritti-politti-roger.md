The Tupamaros got a platinum card (all right)
I got a heart of gold and it's time to get hard (and I like it)
A Moto Guzzi I gotta way to get rich (all right)
I gotta library and a seven day itch (and I like It)

I got money oh I got around but my life was going nowhere

I was looking for love and I want your love baby love
When you gonna get me Boom! there she was
I was looking for love and I want your love baby love
When you gonna get me Boom! there she was - for me

The Tupamaros an immutable truth (all right)
I got a razor blade and a beautiful youth (and I like it)
A Moto Guzzi and a Gaultier pants (all right)
I got a reason girl, was Immanuel Kant's (and I like it)

I got money oh I got around but my life was going nowhere (nowhere)

I was looking for love and I want your love baby love
When you gonna get me Boom! there she was
I was looking for love and I want your love baby love
When you gonna get me Boom! there she was - for me

(baby baby baby
Oh yeah
There she was
Drivin me out
There she was)

Pharmacopoeia - I got a way with the word (all right)
I got and alphabet that you never have heard (and I like it)

I got money oh I got around but my life was going nowhere (no where)

I was looking for love and I want your love baby love
When you gonna get me Boom! there she was
I was looking for love and I want your love baby love
When you gonna get me Boom! there she was - for me

(Looking for love now) (Are you looking for me?)
(I'm looking for love now) (Wanted to get you girl)

I was looking for love and I want your love baby love
When you gonna get me Boom! there she was
I was looking for love and I want your love baby love
When you gonna get me Boom! there she was - for me
