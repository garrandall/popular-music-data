(If you leave, take my heart, take my heart)
If you leave me tonight I will cry
Though you say we will soon meet again
For the hours I've spent here with you
Are like words from a poet's pen


Words like love, and truth, and goodness
Words like Until death us do part
I will never love another
Take my heart, take my heart, take my heart
(Take my heart)

Yes, the hours I've spent here with you
Are like words from a poet's pen


Take my heart, take my heart, take my heart
(Take my heart)
