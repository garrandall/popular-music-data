Well, my friends, the time has come
To raise the roof and have some fun
Throw away the work to be done
Let the music play on (Play on, play on)
Everybody sing, everybody dance
Lose yourself in wild romance


We're going to party, karamu
Fiesta, forever
Come on and sing along
We're going to party, karamu
Fiesta, forever
Come on and sing along


All night long! (all night, all night)
All night long! (all night, all night)
All night long! (all night, all night)
All night long! (all night, all night)


People dancing all in the street
See the rhythm all in their feet
Life is good, wild and sweet
Let the music play on (Play on, play on)
Feel it in your heart
And feel it in your soul
Let the music take control


We're going to party
Liming, fiesta, forever
Come on and sing along
We're going to party
Liming, fiesta, forever
Come on and sing my song


All night long! (all night, all night)
All night long! (all night, all night)
All night long! (all night, all night)
All night long! (all night, all night)


Yeah, once you get started
You can't sit down
Come join the fun
It's a merry-go-round
Everyone's dancing their troubles away
Come join our party
See how we play!




Tam bo li de say de moi ya
Yeah, Jambo Jambo
Way to parti o we goin'
Oh, jambali
Tam bo li de say de moi ya
Yeah, Jambo Jambo
Oh, yes
We're going to have a party!


All night long! (all night, all night)
All night long! (all night, all night)
All night long! (all night, all night)
All night long! (all night, all night)


We're going to party, karamu
Fiesta, forever
Come on and sing along
We're going to party, karamu
Fiesta, forever
Come on and sing my song


All night long! (all night, all night)
All night long! (all night, all night)
All night long! (all night, all night)
All night long! (all night, all night)


Everyone you meet
They're jamming in the street
All night long!
Yeah, I said, everyone you meet
They're jamming in the street
All night long!
Feel good! Feel good!
