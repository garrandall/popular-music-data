(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh)

They call me rag doll (whee ooh)
They put me down (ooh whee ooh)
I couldn't take it any longer
So I got out of town.
I go to parties with playboys
Use them for toys
If my old friends could see (see me now)
They call me (ooh)
Society girl (ahh ahh ahh ahh)
Society girl
But I miss the guy
Who loved me when I was a rag doll.
High yigh society girl.

(Spoken)
'I'll bet that everyone thinks
That livin' in a penthouse
Is being on top of the world.
But you know I'd give it all up
If I could only be your girl'

My new address is (whee ooh)
Park Avenue (ooh whee ooh)
Got a French poodle and some dresses
But I'd rather have you.
Their money can't buy me love, no.
Oh honey I am so glad you can see
(See me now)
(A lonely... ooh)
Society girl (ahh ahh ahh ahh)
Society girl
And I need you more
Than when I was more than a rag doll.
High yigh society girl.

(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh)
