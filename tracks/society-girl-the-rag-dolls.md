(Oh ohoohhoh)oh
(Ah ah ah ah ah)

They call me rag doll (whee oh
They put me down (ohwhee oh
I couldn't take it any longer
So I got out of town.
I go to parties with playboys
Use them for toys
If my old friends could see (see me now)
They call me (oh
Society girl (ah ah ah ah)
Society girl
But I miss the guy
Who loved me when I was a rag doll.
High yigh society girl.

(Spoken)
'I'll bet that everyone thinks
That livin' in a penthouse
Is being on top of the world.
But you know I'd give it all up
If I could only be your girl'

My new address is (whee oh
Park Avenue (ohwhee oh
Got a French poodle and some dresses
But I'd rather have you.
Their money can't buy me love, no.
Oh honey I am so glad you can see
(See me now)
(A lonely... oh
Society girl (ah ah ah ah)
Society girl
And I need you more
Than when I was more than a rag doll.
High yigh society girl.

(Oh ohoohhoh)oh
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
