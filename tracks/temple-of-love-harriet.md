Oh, yeah, uh huh Until the rivers run dry
Like a stain from a child's cry
Until the snow brings fall
My love will wait to hear your call Whether or not you understand
How one woman could love
One man the way I love you I'll build you a temple and fill it with love
Stone by stone from morn til dusk
A temple and fill it with love I'll cross the mountains for you
Just so you know my love is true
I'll build you a bridge
If it takes a thousand men
Just to have you love me again Whether or not you understand
Just how one woman could love
Love one man the way I love you I'll build you a temple and fill it with love
Stone by stone from morn til dusk
I'll build you a temple and fill it with love And when my trying is done
Will love be locked and never undone
I'll build this temple so we can be alone
I'll build it strong like the love we own Whether or not you understand
Just how one woman could love
Love one man the way I love you I'll build you a temple and fill it with love
Stone by stone from morn til dusk
I'll build you a temple and fill it with love I'll build you a temple and fill it with love
Stone by stone from morn til dusk
I'll do anything, anything, anything for you
Yes, I will Build you a temple of love
Would I do anyhing for you, oh...
