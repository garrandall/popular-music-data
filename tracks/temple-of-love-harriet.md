There's something 'bout this day that seem good to me
When people I ain't like is showin' love to me
Good food and the mood and the hood is free
Peace and free is the frequency
This is the day women took over
No longer over your shoulder do you have to look over
Imagine, war is now over
Mothers get medals for being courageous soldiers
On dollars, it's Michelle Obama, Oprah and Rosa
The mayor, the shah is Liz Dozier
Hoods feel safer, families feel closer
We all drunk in love with no need to be sober
Ladies get their hair done, and men, we notice
You get high grade Indian weaves, at the lowest
Prices, chivalry is no longer lifeless
We openin' doors and pullin' out chairs again
Things are merry, there's more marryin'
Monthly free doses of Motrin and Valerian
For your menstrual, it's no more minstral shows
Depictin' women as ignorant simple hoes
It's more love songs from the radio
Respect for the ladies, you can hear it in the flow
Egos aside, for each other we rise
Since they done give us a life, the whole world feel alive


Oh, when women take over the world
Oh, every woman, boy and girl
Oh, maybe one day, we will see
Peace and unity the way it's meant to be


The day women took over, let it continue
Now women get paid as much as men do
Dr. Angelou's lookin' from Heaven's window
Tellin' young girls phenomenal woman is in you
Body is a temple, men don't pray
Mother earth's arms around you sayin' it's okay
Toilet seats down, that's a no-brainer
Monuments in Washington of Fanny Lou Hamer
Harriet, a soldier of truth is marchin' on
Women preachers and world leaders, it now the norm
Healthcare, payin' for nails, jails and fill-ins
Intellectual buildin', intersexual healin'
No stickin' movers, and no quick shooters
After 15 minutes, callin' you a Uber
The New World Order is fathers lovin' their daughters
And baby's mamas supported and ladies gettin' courted
In court, kids can't be tried as adults
And women, they called B's because they a boss
In all shapes and sizes, beauty is recognized
Goddess and queens is what we use to describe
Now Michelle Alexander wrote the new constitution
BeyoncÃ© made the music for the revolution
Imagine it, a world more compassionate
The malice of the feminine and masculine, I'm askin' if


Oh, what if women took over the world
Oh, every woman, boy and girl
Oh, maybe one day, we will see
Peace and unity the way it's meant to be
