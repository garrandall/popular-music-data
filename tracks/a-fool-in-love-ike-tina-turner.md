Oh, there's something on my mind
Won't somebody please, please tell me what's wrong?

You're just a fool, you know you're in love (What you say?)
You've got to face it to live in this world (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey... whoa, hey hey...)
You take the good along with the bad
Sometimes you're happy, and sometimes you're sad (One more time...)
You know you love him, you can't understand (Tell me 'bout it!)
Why he treats you like he do, when he's such a good man

Listen! He's got me smiling when I should be ashamed
Got me laughing when my heart is in pain
Oh now, I must be a fool
But I'll do anything he wants me to
Now how come?

You're just a fool, you know you're in love (Tell me one more time...)
You've got to face it to live in this world... (Hey, hey hey, hey, hey... whoa, hey, hey...)
You take the good along with the bad
Sometimes you're happy, and sometimes you're sad... (One more time...)
You know you love him, you can't understand (Tell me 'bout it!)
Why he treats you like he do, when he's such a good man

Listen! Without my man, I don't wanna live
You think I'm lying, but I'm telling you like it is
He's got my nose open, and that's no lie
And I, I'm gonna keep him satisfied
Now how come

You're just a fool, you know you're in love (Tell me how come...)
You've got to face it to live in this world... (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey... whoa! Hey, hey...)
You take the good along with the bad
Sometimes you're happy, and sometimes you're sad (One more time...)
You know you love him, you can't understand (Tell me 'bout it!)
Why he treats you like he do when he's such a good man

Listen! Ways of action speaks louder than words
The truest saying that I ever heard
I trust my man in all that he do
And I'll, and I'll do anything he wants me to do
Now how come?

You're just a fool, you know you're in love (Tell me one more time...)
You've got to face it to live in this world... (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey... whoa! Hey, hey...)
You take the good along with the bad
Sometimes you're happy, and sometimes you're sad (Tell me one more time...)
You know you love him, you can't understand (Oh...)
Why he treats you like he do, when he's such a good man

(Tell me...)
Doo doo, doo, doo (Tell me one more time...)
Doo doo, doo, doo (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey... yeah! hey, hey)
Doo doo, doo, doo (One more time!)
Doo doo, doo, doo (Oh...)
Doo doo, doo, doo
