Let me wrap you in my warm and tender love, yeah
Let me wrap you in my warm and tender love
Oh, I loved you for a long, long time
Darling, please say you'll be mine
And let me wrap you in my warm and tender love

Let me wrap you in my warm and tender love, yeah
Let me wrap you in my warm and tender love
You're so lovely, you're oh so fine

Come on and please me with your touch
And let me wrap you in my warm and tender love

For I loved you for a long, long time
Darling please say you'll be mine
And let me wrap you in my warm and tender love
I said it'll be alright if you just let me
Let me wrap you in my warm and tender love
Oh baby, come on and let me
Let me wrap you in my warm and tender love
I said it'll be alright if you just let me
Wrap you in my warm and tender love, yeah
