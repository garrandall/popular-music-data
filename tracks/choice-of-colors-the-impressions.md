If you had a choice of colors
Which one would you choose, my brothers
If there was no day or night
Which would you prefer to be right

How long have you hated your white teacher
Who told you, you love your black preacher
Do you respect your brother's woman friend
And share with black folks not of kin

People must prove to the people
A better day is coming for you and for me
With just a little bit more education
And love for our nation
We'll make a better society

Now some of us would rather cuss and make a fuss
Than to bring about a little trust
But we shall overcome, I believe someday
If you'll only listen to what I have to say

And how long have you hated your white teacher
Who told you, you love your black preacher
Can you respect your brother's woman friend
And share with black folks not of kin

I say now, people must prove to the people
A better day is coming for you and for me
With just a little bit more education
And love for our nation
We'll make a better society

And if you had a choice of colors
Which one would you choose, my brothers
If there was no day or night
Which would you prefer to be right

And if you had a choice of colors
Which one would you choose, my brothers
If there was no day or night
Which would you prefer to be right

If you had a choice of colors
Which one would you choose, my brothers
