Check this out baby girl, I want you to check out a nigga,
Cattttt Dadddyyyyy!


Man I go to work, true winner
Jeans skinny, like Squidward
Lookin for your girl, just missed her
Did my cat daddy and I took her down; Timber
Wrist cold, mamma call it winter
Swisher full of nuggets, daddy calls it Denver
Baby got ass chelsea calls its thinnest, UPS checks get it we deliver
Cat daddy when I dougie, cat daddy when I member
(when I member) rockin' skinnies they for rejetz I remember
Competition see the crease, they surrender
Smokin' Wyclef kush
Now I'm gone till november
Move your arms like your wheel chair stunt'n
Drop low grab your shoulder like fuck it
Tell Power 106 to bang this shit
Big up to my bro Sam, he the king of this shit


Call me SpongeBob
Stackin Krabby Patties
Bitch I go to work
Do my Cat Daddy

Call me SpongeBob
Stackin Krabby Patties
Bitch I go to work
Do my Cat Daddy

Cat Daddy, Cat Daddy, Cat Daddy, Cat Daddy (bitch I go to work)
Cat Daddy, Cat Daddy, Cat Daddy, Cat Daddy (bitch I go to work)


You heard of Too $hort?
I'm too long
I'm in the club all black goin Akon
Like headlights
I'm too on
Do my Cat Daddy going nuts
Acorn
Ima muthafuckin fool for this
When it come to the yard, I'm the coolest kid
I'm in my prime barbecue rib
And these Milfs like pubes all around my dick
I block a hater like a goalie
Pockets guacamole
Checks in the bank as she acts like a rollie
did it with your chick she ate the Cat Daddy lonely
Give her jungle fever, in the mall she glowin
Yea I'm crackin' like a new born rooster
Take your chick in the mall, yea we call that booster
Dont get mad, it's your chick, she choose it
Cat Daddy haters screamin "What the Fuck They Doing?"


Call me SpongeBob
Stackin Krabby Patties
Bitch I go to work
Do my Cat Daddy

Call me SpongeBob
Stackin Krabby Patties
Bitch I go to work
Do my Cat Daddy

Cat Daddy, Cat Daddy, Cat Daddy, Cat Daddy (bitch I go to work)
Cat Daddy, Cat Daddy, Cat Daddy, Cat Daddy (bitch I go to work)


Tell em Moe, Cat Daddy for I smash that
Big chain, cost a couple stacks man
J Hawk, make em slap on the track,
Do ya dance, You gonna wanna learn it for a day
Dip up in the Range Rover, Park like Yosemite
(Errrr) Blow a champ dog, smoking like a Chimney
You study ya matter and energy, its chemistry
Haters don't matter, bitches join my energy
Super fitted in the funk CAT DADDY
Then come up swing my arms, CAT DADDY
Baby I'm thuggin
Every weekend out clubbin
Little niggas show me love and the fade is nothin
Rain on me everyday, same pantry (money)
Since the day I was born, I been a star, Patrick
CAT DADDY, CAT CAT DADDY
CAT DADDY, CAT CAT DADDY


Call me SpongeBob
Stackin Krabby Patties
Bitch I go to work
Do my Cat Daddy

Cat Daddy, Cat Daddy, Cat Daddy, Cat Daddy (bitch I go to work)
Cat Daddy, Cat Daddy, Cat Daddy, Cat Daddy (bitch I go to work)
