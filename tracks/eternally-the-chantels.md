You said you'd leave me never
Never, ever, ever
And our love would last
For all eternity (eternally)

I don't need a new love
Now that I have you
Give me all of your sweet love
For all eternity (eternally)

For always and always
I'll be true to you
And my endeavor which
Means ever and ever
Will you be true
For I'll be loving

You said you'd leave me never
Never, ever, ever
And our love would last
For all eternity (eternally)

Eternally, ahh...
Eternally, ahh...
