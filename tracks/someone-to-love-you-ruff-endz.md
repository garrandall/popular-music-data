Mmm...yeah
Mmm...mmm...mmm...mmm

I bet you that I could read your mind
And tell you everything you're going through
Baby, I could try to find a thousand reasons why
You're alone and acting so cold

Tell me how long you've been this way
Maybe I can open up your heart
See, I've been waiting all my life for someone just like you
And I know you've been waiting too
For someone to love you


All you need is someone who cares (For someone to love you)
Someone who will always be there (Mmm...mmm...)
All you need to say is that you want me to be with you
Girl, I know you've waited so long
For someone to love you

Oh...
Mmm, mmm, mmm

Baby, I wish I could be there
For every time you ever shed a tear
Baby, I hate to see a pretty girl like you
Going through the things that you do, yeah

Girl, I think you've gone too far too long
Without a good man to make you smile
How can I appeal to you and make you understand
That I'm here, when you're ready for
Someone to love you



Baby you've been waiting for the man from all the fairytales
or maybe just the man from all your dreams
try to think reality, explore the possibilities
cause girl you know you've waited for so long
for some one to love you
(oh-yooh-yooh-yoooh)
(for someone to love you)
(waited oh so long)

all you you need is someone who cares
(all you need, all you need, baby)
someone who always be there
(in the middle of the night, in the middle of the night)
All you need is someone who cares
(I ain't trying to play no games with you, no, no)
Someone who will always be there
(never leave your side, no no no no)
(all you need!)
all you need is someone who cares
(someone, someone to love you endlessly)
(all you need is someone)
Someone who will always be there
(a man like, a man like me)
All you need is someone who cares
(I just want to hold you)
someone, someone, someone
(How was your day baby)
(all you need)
Someone who will always be there
(baby open up your heart!)
All you need is someone
(baby, lady, someone who loves you, will care for you)
All you need is someone
(baby, lady, I wanna be the one, please)
All you need is someone


woo! I care for you
all you need is someone
take my hand, I wanna be that someone
all you need is someone
momma said there'd be days like this, momma said there'd be days like this
tell me, tell me baby you believe in someone
