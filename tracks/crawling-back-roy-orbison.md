Only you and no one else 
Can keep me crawling back 
You know I cant help myself 
And now I'm crawling back 

After all you've done to me 
The times you've turned me down 
I still will be your clown 
Because I love you 
I'm crawling back 

You know I would die for you 
Heaven knows how I have cried for you 
But what else can I do 
But crawl on back to you, ooh 
Crawling back to you 

People stop they talk and they stare 
But they don't know that you really care 
That you're only lonely, and making believe 
And you need me around 
When the world turns you down 

Whenever you might need me 
I will come crawling back 
Wherever you will lead me 
I will come crawling back
