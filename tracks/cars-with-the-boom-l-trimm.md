So many kinds where can we start
 we like them dumb and we like them smart
 I like the ones with the pretty eyes
 well I like all kinds of guys
 STOP
 what happen'?
 how about the ones we especially like?
 Wich one?
 You know, the ones with the cars that go

 I hear ya!
 hit it

It was me and the posse with bunny d
We were cruising in the Jags or the Lamborghinis
When lo and behold, there appeared a mirage
He was hooking up a car in his daddy's garage
We stopped short, did a double take
He was looking so fine I thought I wasn't awake
He was obviously hooking up bass I assumed
But then he turned the little button and the car went boom


We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We're Tigra and Bunny and we like the boom
We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We're Tigra and Bunny and we like the boom


We like them short and we like them tall
We like them one and we like them all
They're always adding speakers when they find the room
Cause they know we love the guys with the cars that go boom
And see my boyfiend really knows where it's at
He's got 50 inch woofers all along the back
He makes a comment on going to my room
But I rather stay out with his car that goes boom


We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We're Tigra and Bunny and we like the boom
We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We're Tigra and Bunny and we like the boom



Now if your car ain't got it
Go out and get it

We like the boom
And don't you forget it

So turn down the treble
And flaunt your bass

So your car could be heard
Almost any place

Cause a banger in the street
He can't go far

Without hearing the boom
Pouring out your car

Yo if your speakers' weak
Then please turn it off

Cause we like the cars
That's down so tough


We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We're Tigra and Bunny and we like the boom
We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We're Tigra and Bunny and we like the boom
