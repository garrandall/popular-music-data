Come with me and I'll show you how
Making love can be
You will see that it's here and now
This is our destiny

We'll spend the night by candlelight
While we're romancing, baby
As we glide from side to side
Slow dancing, oh, slow dancing

Come on right now, baby
Come on right now

Close your eyes and drift away
Into my fantasy
Oh, don't ask why
Just say you'll stay and I
Will fulfill all your dreams

Let your mind drift into time
While we're romancing, baby
As we meet cheek to cheek
Sugar, we're slow dancing
Oh, slow dancing

Come on right now, baby
Come on right now
Slow dance with me

Sugar, sugar

Let your mind drift into time
While we're romancing, baby
As we meet cheek to cheek
Oh, sugar, we're slow dancing
Oh, slow dancing

Oh, slow dance
Slow dance with me

Come on right now, baby
Come on right now
Come on right now, baby
Come on right now

Slow dance with me
Slow dance

Come on right now, baby
Come on right now
Come on right now, baby
Come on right now
Slow dance with me
