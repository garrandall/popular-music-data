I wanna go higher
I wanna go higher
I wanna go higher
I wanna go higher (higher baby)
I wanna go higher (higher baby)

If I ever get down in the dumps
Short of a dollar nothin change for months
It seems to rain about every day
And all the news seeme kinda grey
Its no illusion call it reality
So I release more charge from my battery
We can rise death defy gravity
Bring about a sense of personality
So as I walk I look around
See some go up , some go down
There goes the man his nose is brown
Guess how he get to wear his crown
But his hands are shaking the walls are breakin
And one day they will all fall down
Sometimes its better that way
Makin space for a some better day

We're on the ground floor got lots to learn
Slip to the basement and you burn
First floor and you start to fall
Out the bed clothes answer the door
On the second I comprehend
Positive waves are what I send
Third floor and you start to flow
Tell me now where d'ya wanna go

(higher baby)
I wanna go higher (higher baby)
Were'd you wanna go?
I wanna go higher (higher baby)
I wanna go higher (higher baby)

So tell me baby kinda shakey
We ain't been too friendly lately
Things sometimes turn out that way
And that is all that you got to say
Well thats ok cause time can soothe
Like a dentist pulls out a tooth
As each new day will bring a new face
How can I make my rhyme go someplace

First of all she ask for more
I said sure I don't mind at all
The waters deep but I'm walking tall
It don't matter if you're rich or poor
Ain't here to score just raise the floor
Maximum vibes what I'm aiming for
I do my war dance back to the wall
Just returning my native call

And thats the way we're getting by ya
Always keeping you on the wire
Takin you higher - call me a liar
But you won't cause you're feeling inspired
Work we're going to, jerk you're all thru
Theres no way you'll stop my breakthru
Two ways to do it, get in or get out
Elevate yourself don't hang about
So wherever lies you'r latitude
Wherever you are we're gaining altitude
In all directions starting to climb
So come on girl - elevate my mind

I wanna go higher (elevate my mind)
I wanna go higher (higher baby)
(Let it reach ya) I wanna go higher (higher baby)
(Elevate my mind) I wanna go higher (higher baby)

I wanna go higher
I wanna go higher
I wanna go higher
