Woman is the nigga of
The world
Yes she is...think about it
Woman is the nigga of
The world
Think about it...do
Something about it
We make her paint her
Face and dance
If she won't be slave ,we
Say that she don't love us
If she's real, we say she's
Trying to be a man
While putting her down we
Pretend that she is above us
Woman is the nigga of
The world...yes she is
If you don't belive me take a
Look to the one you're with
Woman is the slaves of
The slaves
Ah yeah...better screem
About it
We make her bear and raise
Our children
And then we leave her flat for
Being a fat old mother hen
We tell her home is the only
Place she would be
Then we complain that she's
Too unworldly to be our friend
Woman is the nigga of
The world...yes she is
If you don't belive me take a
Look to the one you're with
Woman is the slaves of
The slaves
Yeah (think about it)
We insult her everyday on TV
And wonder why she has no
Guts or confidence
When she's young we kill her
Will to be free
While telling her not to be so
Smart we put her down for being so dumb
Woman is the nigga of
The world...yes she is
If you don't belive me take a
Look to the one you're with
Woman is the slaves of
The slaves
Yes she is...if you belive me
You better screem about it
Repeat:
We make her paint her
Face and dance
We make her paint her
Face and dance We make her paint her
Face and dance
