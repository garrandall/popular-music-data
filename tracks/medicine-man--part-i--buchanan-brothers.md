Come close
The changes are drastic
You've been trippin' the light fantastic
Your soul's in a shakedown
Baby, you're headed for a breakdown
I've got the potion, perpetual motion

Put your faith in me, don't you know
I'm the man, understand
I'm the only one who can
I'm the bad, make you glad, medicine man
Got the cure, it's for sure
I'm the one you're lookin for
I'm the bad, make you glad, medicine man

Come close, come close, come close, come close
I'm loaded for action
I guarantee you satisfaction
My baby needs huggin
My baby needs some super lovin
I've got the potion, perpetual motion
I've got the potion, perpetual motion
Right here in my hand

Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold tight now, don't let go
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold tight now, don't let go
