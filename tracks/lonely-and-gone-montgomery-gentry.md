Pulled in the driveway, picked up the paper 
Found my key, and unlocked the door 
I walked in, felt like a stranger 
Like I'd never, been there before 
And as I wandered room to room 
It was silent as a tomb 

Coulda heard a tear drop, coulda heard a heart break 
Never saw the flood come, even though I felt the rain 
Never heard a house sound, so loud with memories 
Where there used to be a happy home 
In the house on the corner of lonely and gone 

If she talked about leavin, I wasn't listenin 
If she showed me a sign, well I never saw 
Did she stop believin, did I stop givin 
Can't put my finger on what went wrong 
Now the quietest noise I'm told 
Is the sound of letting go. 

Coulda heard a tear drop, coulda heard a heart break 
Never saw the flood come, even though I felt the rain 
Never heard a house sound, so loud with memories 
Where there used to be a happy home 
In the house on the corner of lonely and gone 

Oh never heard a house sound, so loud with memories 
Where there used to be a happy home 
In the house on the corner, in the house on the corner 
Of lonely and gone
