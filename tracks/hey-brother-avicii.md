Hey, brother
There's an endless road to rediscover
Hey, sister
Know the water's sweet but blood is thicker


Oh, if the sky comes falling down
For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do


Hey, brother
Do you still believe in one another?
Hey, sister
Do you still believe in love?
I wonder


Oh, if the sky comes falling down
For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do


What if I'm far from home?
Oh brother, I will hear you call
What if I lose it all?
Oh sister, I will help you out
Oh, if the sky comes falling down
For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do


Hey, brother
There's an endless road to rediscover
Hey, sister
Do you still believe in love? I wonder


Oh, if the sky comes falling down
For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do


What if I'm far from home?
Oh brother, I will hear you call
What if I lose it all?
Oh sister, I will help you out
Oh, if the sky comes falling down
For you, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
