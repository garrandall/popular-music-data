When I'm alone at night
And there's no one to comfort me
I think of you . . 
And suddenly my pillow is your face and your arms
And when the winter wind comes chasin' after me
I think of you . . 
And it's as though I crawl beneath the blanket
Soft and warm

How did I get from dark to daylight
Before you happened to pass by?
How did I find my way through life
Before you brightened up my sky?
Was there a sky at all
Until you painted it for me?
How did I get on
â€˜Till you came along?

Who knows how many times I pause in every day
To think of you?
As often as the sun sails out upon the silent sea!
And if you're wonderin' why it is I only think of you
Well it's because I'd like to be as close to you
As you've become to me!
I think of you . . 
I think of you . .
