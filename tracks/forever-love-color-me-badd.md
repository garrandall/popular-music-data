You never know
It's hard to say sometimes, where a love will lead
It's a mystery, you take a chance
It's in the hands of faith, If we'll make it sugar
Time alone will show us what will be
Until we're sure about it,
We don't want to rush into anything baby


Why don't we just start with forever
And take it from there
If you got the time, baby I've got a lifetime to share
Why don't we spend some time together
Let's start with forever.

I understand...
I understand that you don't know me well
And if it's meant to be, only time will tell
I only know that when I'm in your arms (I know)
I wanna stay there always
I would like to spend my life with you
If your not sure about it (love, love, love...
We don't have to rush into anything baby



Ohh, It's gonna take at least a lifetime
To know what's gonna be (know what's gonna be)
So why don't you spend a lifetime with me
I believe that we can make it together, I feel no doubt
Let's spend forever just finding out (just finding out)

Time alone will show us what we'll be
If your not sure about it (love, love, love...
We don't have to rush into anything baby

Why don't we just start with forever, and take it from there
If you've got the time, baby I've got a lifetime to share
Start with forever, whoa start with forever

Let's start with tonight
