So if you're lonely
You know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a crosshair
I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here
You leave me broken, shattered I lie
I'm just a crosshair
I'm just a shot then we can die

I know I wont be leaving here with you

(I say) I say don't you know
(You say) You say you don't you know
I say, I say take me out

I stay, you don't show
Don't move, time is low
I say, I say take me out

(I say) I say don't you know
(You say) You say you don't go
I say, I say take me out

If I move this could die
If eyes move this could die
I want you, I want you to take me out

I know I wont be leaving here
I know I wont be leaving here
I know I wont be leaving here
I know I wont be leaving here
With you

(I say) I say don't you know
(You say) You say you don't know
I say, I say take me out

If I wait this could die
If I wane this could die
I want you, I want you to take me out

If I move this could die
If eyes move this could die
Come on you, come on you
Take me out

I know I wont be leaving here
I know I wont be leaving here
I know I wont be leaving here
I know I wont be leaving here
With you
