So if you're lonely, you know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a crosshair, I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here, you leave me broken, shattered I lie
I'm just a crosshair, I'm just a shot, then we can die


I know I won't be leaving here with you


I say, don't you know? You say you don't know
I say: take me out
I say, you don't show, don't move, time is slow
I say: take me out
Well, I say, you don't know, you say you don't know
I say: take me out
If I move, this could die, if eyes move, this could die
I want you to take me out


I know I won't be leaving here (with you)
I know I won't be leaving here (with you)
I know I won't be leaving here (with you)
I know I won't be leaving here with you


I say, don't you know? You say you don't know
I say: take me out
If I wane, this could die, I wait this, could die
I want you to take me out
If I move, this could die, eyes move, this can die
Come on, take me out


I know I won't be leaving here (with you)
I know I won't be leaving here (with you)
I know I won't be leaving here (with you)
I know I won't be leaving here with you
