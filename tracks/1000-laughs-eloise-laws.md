Didn't we have the magic?
Didn't we have the touch?
Didn't we find our rainbow?
Drenched in golden dust
Didn't we love the music?
Didn't we love the song?
Didn't we lose it all
By dancing much too long?

Yeah
We had a thousand laughs a minute
But love don't rest a minute
Didn't we have some fun?
Oh, didn't we beat the drum?
Boy, we had a thousand laughs a minute
But don't, don't rest a minute
Didn't we have some fun?
Oh, didn't we beat the drum?

Didn't we find enchantment?
In everything we did
Maybe it was wrong
We played too much like kids
Oh, but didn't we share a moment
You have ever known
Don't you think we're lucky
At least we'll always know

Yeah
We had a thousand laughs a minute
But love don't rest a minute
Didn't we have some fun?
Oh, didn't we beat the drum?
Boy, we had a thousand laughs a minute
But don't, don't rest a minute
Didn't we have some fun?
Oh, didn't we beat the drum?

Repeat the last verse and fade.
