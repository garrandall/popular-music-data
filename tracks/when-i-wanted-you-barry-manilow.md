Tho' we're going our separate ways
There can only be brighter days
'Cause I didn't mean that much to you
Work it out, don't lose the fight
You can make it turn out right
'Cause you've got the heart to be secure

When I wanted you I needed you
And I still can't bring myself to say I'm over you
When I gave you time to make up your mind
You turned you back on me
And now I've got to turn my back on you

After all that we've been through
Leavin' you is so hard to do
But when I close my eyes I don't feel the pain
What was wrong and who was right
In the end you see the light
'Cause you think a lot when you're on your own

When I wanted you
I needed you
And I still can't bring myself to say I'm over you
When I gave you time to make up your mind
You turned you back on me
And now I'm turnin' mine on you

Now you're on your own
How does it feel
To feel the way I used to feel

Chorus
