Throw it up!

(Woo hoo!)
(Woo, hoo! Woo, hoo!)
(Woo, hoo!) (yeah, yeah)
(Woo, hoo!) (yeah, yeah)


You're pretty, baby
But you know that
Wish I could bring ya
Across the map, yeah

I can feel it in the air that it's on tonight
I don't really care if it's wrong or right
Pedal to the metal
Baby, hold me tight
Anything you want I can get that, girl
If you're with that, girl


Everybody knows that I want ya
If you want me
Baby, show me
Roll the windows down
Let your hair flow
Let it all go tonight (night, night, night...)
(Party people!)


Woo hoo
All the windows down
Woo hoo
When I'm rolling through your town
(Woo hoo!)
Saying yeah, yeah
(Woo hoo!)
Saying yeah, yeah


You drive me crazy
But you know that
Feel the breeze girl
Let's take a lap, yeah

I can feel it in the air that it's on tonight
I don't really care if it's wrong or right
Pedal to the metal
Baby, hold me tight
Anything you want I can get that, girl
If you're with that, girl


Everybody knows, that I want ya
If you want me, baby show me
(Yo!)
Roll the windows down
Let your hair flow
Let it all go tonight (night, night, night...)
(Party people!)


Woo hoo
All the windows down
Woo hoo
When I'm rolling through your town
(Woo hoo!)
Saying yeah, yeah
(Woo hoo!)
Saying yeah, yeah




It's on tonight
It's on tonight
(It's on-on-on-on-on tonight)


Woo hoo
All the windows down
Woo hoo
When I'm rolling through your town
(Woo hoo!)
Saying yeah, yeah
(Woo hoo!)
Saying yeah, yeah
(Let's go!)

Woo hoo
All the windows down
Woo hoo
When I'm rolling through your town
(Woo hoo!)
Saying yeah, yeah
(Woo hoo!)
Saying yeah, yeah
Woo, hoo!
