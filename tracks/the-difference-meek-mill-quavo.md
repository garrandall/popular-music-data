Sonny Rollin' Grams of Wax


You got a bag and I got a bag but they know the difference
If you talking cash and I'm talking cash but they know the difference (Cash, cash)
They know the difference (They know the difference)
They know the difference (They know the difference)
You got a Wraith and I got a Wraith
But they know the difference (Cash)
Bought the machine in 2016 so they know the difference
The diamonds is shinin' the rollie is clean so they know the difference
They know the difference (They know the difference)
They know the difference (They know the difference)
Your bitches is bad, and my bitches bad but we know the difference


In the trenches gettin' back at it
With the haters and the backstabbers
Head huntin' for a rat rapper
Head huntin' for a wack rapper
I ain't really with the back and forth and nigga, I'm a send a hundred stacks at em
Nigga probably send the rats at em
Ninja turtle with a rat master
All this money won't stop nigga
30 round that Glock nigga
Feds lurk and we hot nigga
Swing through in that drop nigga
Moon walkin' in that dealer, like it's Thriller with the scrilla I'm a cop nigga
I'm a killer, you a cop nigga
Kick the door like we SWAT nigga

They know the difference, I really get it
I'm with the scammers, I'm buying bags for all of my bitches, (For all of my hoes)
Only the family
Keep all them niggas from out of my business
(From out of my business)
Cause I really did shit, I rapped about it you know that I lived it


You got a bag and I got a bag but they know the difference
If you talking cash and I'm talking cash but they know the difference (Cash, cash)
They know the difference (They know the difference)
They know the difference (They know the difference)
You got a Wraith and I got a Wraith
But they know the difference (Cash)
Bought the machine in 2016 so they know the difference
The diamonds is shinin' the rollie is clean
They know the difference, they know the difference
Your bitches bad and my bitches bad but we know the difference


Get to the bags, run up the racks
My bitches are bad, your diamonds finessed
Came in on a jet, 50 my neck, 30 my clip (graa)
I pour a eight and just sip
I put the brick on the trip
I put the dick on her lip
Money before the deal, I had to go bury a mill
She wanna pop the whole perc
I told her we splittin' that pill
My niggas been in the field
We know you put something in that seal
Used to pull up in that audi, I make the work do pilates
Screw the lil tip on the uzi, young nigga shootin' in silence
Huncho I'm havin' the stars and stripes, lil nigga you is a private
Too much money that will change your life
Power moves on a island


You got a bag and I got a bag but they know the difference
If you talking cash and I'm talking cash but they know the difference (Cash, cash)
They know the difference (They know the difference)
They know the difference (They know the difference)
You got a Wraith and I got a Wraith
But they know the difference (Cash)
Bought the machine in 2016 so they know the difference
The diamonds is shinin' the rollie is clean
They know the difference, they know the difference
Your bitches bad and my bitches bad but we know the difference
