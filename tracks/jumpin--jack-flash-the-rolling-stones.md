One two!


I was born in a crossfire hurricane
And I howled at the morning drivin' rain


But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas


I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag
I was schooled with a strap right across my back


But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas


I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled
Yeah, yeah
I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I was crowned with a spike right thru my head
My, my, yeah


But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas


Jumpin' Jack Flash, its a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, its a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, its a gas
Jumpin' Jack Flash, its a gas
