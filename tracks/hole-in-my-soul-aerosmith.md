I'm down a one way street 
With a one night stand 
With a one track mind 
Out in no man's land 
(The punishment sometimes don't seem to fit the crime) 

Yeah there's a hole in my soul 
But one thing I've learned 
For every love letter written 
There's another one burned 
(So you tell me how it's gonna be this time) 

Is it over 
Is it over 
'Cause I'm blowin' out the flame 

Take a walk outside your mind 
Tell me how it feels to be 
The one who turns the knife inside of me 
Take a look and you will find there's nothing there girl 
Yeah I swear, I'm telling you girl yeah 'cause 
There's a hole in my soul that's been killing me forever 
It's a place where a garden never grows 
There's a hole in my soul, yeah I should have known better 
'Cause your love's like a thorn without a rose 

I'm as dry as a seven year drought 
I got dust for tears 
And I'm all tapped out 
(Sometimes I feel broke and can't get fixed) 

I know there's been all kinds of shoes underneath your bed 
Now I sleep with my boots on but you're still in my head 
(And something tells me this time I'm down to my last licks) 
'Cause if it's over 
Then it's over 
And it's driving me insane 

Take a walk outside your mind 
Tell me how it feels to be 
The one who turns the knife inside of me 
Take a look and you will find 
There's nothing there girl yeah I swear 
I'm telling you girl, yeah, 
'Cause there's a hole in my soul 
That's been killing me forever 
It's a place where a garden never grows 
There's a hole in my soul 
Yeah, I should have known better 
'Cause your love's like a thorn 
Without a rose 

Is it over 
Yeah it's over 
And I'm blowin' out the flame 

Take a walk outside your mind 
Tell me how it feels to be 
The one who turns the knife inside of me 
Take a look and you will find 
There's nothing there girl yeah I swear 
I'm telling you girl, yeah, 
'Cause there's a hole in my soul 
That's been killing me forever 
It's a place where a garden never grows 
There's a hole in my soul 
Yeah, I should have known better 
'Cause your love's like a thorn 
Without a rose
