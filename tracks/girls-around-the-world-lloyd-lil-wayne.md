(Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh)

You're my pusha
Girl you got the world
But I wanna try
Don't wanna break the rules but I get high off your supply
Don't make me wait
I'll do what it takes
Your love is the fix I wanna taste

Her love is like cocaine cocaine
I'm flying on a private plane
And I'm so high (so high, so high, I sail in the sky)
Cobain, Cobain
She blows my brain
I'm trippin', I'm rollin'
I'm losing all control cause

She's my pusha, pusha
She's my pusha pusha
Girl she's my pusha, pusha
Pusha, pusha

She gon' make me push it
Push our love
She gon' make me push it
Push our love
She gon' make me push it
Push our love
She gon' make me push it
Push our love

I'm lifted baby
Your love is extasy
Everytime I'm with ya baby
I relapse and I OD
I'm addicted to you
Keep coming back for more
Never took a trip like this before

Her love is like cocaine cocaine
I'm flying on a private plane
And I'm so high (so high, so high, I sail in the sky)
Cobain, Cobain
She blows my brain
I'm trippin', I'm rollin'
I'm losing all control cause

She's my pusha, pusha
She's my pusha pusha
Girl she's my pusha, pusha
Pusha, pusha

She gon' make me push it
Push our love
She gon' make me push it
Push our love
She gon' make me push it
Push our love
She gon' make me push it
Push our love

(Pusha, yes she's my pusha, yes she's my pusha, yes she's my my my pusha)


And this is your Wayne on drugs
I be running around getting high on love
Too much it kill you, I know that's right
But she got that crack and I got that pipe
Now if shes the pusha, then I'm the hustla
And loves the drug, then this for the lovers
Uh, one time for them boys in the streets with it
But me and shorty we be hustlin in the sheets with it
She sellin em fire
And only when the drugs are done, I'll feel like dying
She dope, she bad, I think I'm a have to go to rehab

She's my pusha, pusha
She's my pusha pusha
Girl she's my pusha, pusha
Pusha, pusha

She gon' make me push it
Push our love
She gon' make me push it
Push our love
She gon' make me push it
Push our love
She gon' make me push it
Push our love

Push our love
(Push, push, push)
