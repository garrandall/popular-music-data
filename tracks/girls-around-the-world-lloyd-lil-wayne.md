+ (Lloyd)
"All around the world, girls, all around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world"
(I just want to be your man girl)
(So uh, gotta make you understand girl)


It's the way you flip your hair and those stylish clothes you wear
When you walk into the room, all my partners stopped and stared at you
But they just been the usual
It's the tattoo on your back and that brand new Louie bag
With them matchin' high heels; I can't help this girl's swag's the truth
And I just want to give her love, oh


Girl I, can't get you off my mind - you're like my favorite song (song)
Just want to turn you on, and work you all night long cause I (oh I)
I just want to be your man (I just wanna be your man)


Just to smell your perfume, got me goin out my head
See you comin' see you goin', never met someone as bad as you
Since you're my favorite girl, yeah
I know just what you need, to make you look complete
This platinum wedding ring, cause oh I got a thing for you
I'm a take you around the world, oh baby

Ah ha ha, yeah
OK I'm thinkin' of a master plan
Nah, I'm lyin', shorty on my mind
Shorty like a fryin', pan, and I ain't got
Nothin' but sweat inside my hands
So I dig into my pocket, all my money is spent
But I don't need a cent, cause shorty priceless
I tell it like this, I been (all around the world)
So baby I can take you (all around the world)
I roll up, this is a hold up; it's Young Money man
Shorty made me smile when ain't a damn thing funny
Heh heh, but still don't nothin' move but the money
So baby if I move then we move with the money
Which is my favorite dish
But if I taste you that'll probably switch
And then we will probably switch
Now I'm walking up the street, whistling this
