I really notice that you don't sleep at night
Say why do you worry, why you hurting inside?
Who's hurt you baby? I like you a lot
You are so beautiful and that is a fact
Yeah, yeah
Jealous
I watch the sun, it cuts through the cloudy skies
It heals these wounds and makes me glad to be alive
So don't you worry, no don't you worry
I'll make you happy, happy
Yeah, yeah
Something's wrong, something's wrong with you
Jealous, yeah
Something's really wrong, something's wrong with you
Jealous, Jealous, Jealous, Jealous
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Jealous, Jealous
I spot two lovers on the Old Brompton Road
I feel so jealous, I need someone to hold
Who's hurt you baby? I Like you a lot
I look at you and I know that something's up
Something's wrong, something's wrong with you
Jealous
Something's really wrong, something's wrong with you
Jealous, Jealous, Jealous, Jealous
How do you like the cat
Kitty, kitty, kitty
