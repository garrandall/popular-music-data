Don't be blue
My pretty bluebell
Don't you fret
Although you know that we must part
Don't be blue
My pretty bluebell
You will always be the flower of my heart

CHORUS
And all the way to Albuquerque
I'll be feeling mighty perky
Knowin' that I got a gal so true
And if you save up all your kisses
I'll change your name to Mrs.
On the day that I come back to you
Wait for me
My pretty bluebell
Wait for me
Although you know that we must part
Wedding bells
My pretty bluebell
Will be ringing for the flower of my heart
Of my heart
Of my heart

Don't be blue
My pretty bluebell
Don't be blue
Blue, bluebell
Don't be blue
My pretty bluebell
Bluebell blue


Flower of my heart
