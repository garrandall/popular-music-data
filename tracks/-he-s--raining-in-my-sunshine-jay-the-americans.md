See the raindrops falling, hear them fall so loud
Once I stood in sunlight; now darkness is my shroud
Rain never ever seemed to bother me
Trouble never came my way
The light of her love always followed me
Till her new love turned my world to gray

Now he's raining in my sunshine, clouding up my sky
Yes he's raining in my sunshine, come between her and I
All at once he's taken everything that's mine
Now he stands beside her, he walks in my sunshine
Why did he have to go and steal my love?
Why did he take her away?
She was the only thing I had in life
She was my sunny day
