She calls me up and says baby it's a lonely ol' night
I don't know I'm just so scared and lonely all at the same time
Nobody told us it was gonna work out this way
No, no, no, no, no
I guess they knew we'd work it out in our own way


It's a lonely ol' night
Can I put my arms around you
It's a lonely ol' night
Custom made for two lonely people like me and you

Radio playing softly some singer's sad sad song
He's singing about standing in the shadows of love
I guess he feels awfully alone
She says I know exactly what he means
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And it's a sad, sad feeling when you're living on
Those in-betweens
But it's okay



She calls me Baby She calls everybody Baby
It's a lonely ol' night but ain't they all
