Free, you better love me
And hide or run away
From all your yesterdays

Speak the truth or make your peace some other way, oh yea, yea
Well I never knew, but I believe that your trust in me
Will speak to me!

And way beyond your controlling mind (mind)
And no more believing in all your precious lies

Speak the truth or make your peace some other way, oh yea, yea
Well I never knew, but I believe that your trust in me
Will speak to me!
Speak the truth or make your peace some other way, oh yea, yea, yea
Well I never knew, but I believe that your trust in me
Will speak to me!

Speak the truth or make your peace some other way, oh yea, yea
Well I never knew, but I believe that your trust in me
Will speak to me!
Speak the truth or make your peace some other way, oh yea, yea
Well I never knew, but I believe that your trust in me
Will speak to me!
Speak
Speak
Speak
Speak
Speak!
