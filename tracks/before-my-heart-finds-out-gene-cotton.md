Well, you woke me from a dream about you
Just to say that you were leaving
I'm sleepy but I thought that you said
Our love that will last forever is endin'
Well before you walk out of my life
Would you be especially quiet
And don't you let my heart know that you're leavin'
Don't you say another word about it darlin'
Don't you let my heart hear your footsteps walkin' out
The door of my hopes and dreams
And don't you let my heart know that you're leavin'
Don't you say another word about it darlin'
Leave me now before my heart finds out

Well, I see you writing something down
And leavin' it on the dresser
And the tears in your eyes look a lot like mine
But I guess it's all for the better
Well before we say our last goodbye
Baby won't you hold me just one more time
And don't you let my heart know that you're leavin'
Don't you say another word about it darlin'
Don't you let my heart hear your footsteps walkin' out
The door of my hopes and dreams
And don't you let my heart know that you're leavin'
Don't you say another word about it darlin'
Leave me now before my heart finds out
Leave me now before my heart finds out
