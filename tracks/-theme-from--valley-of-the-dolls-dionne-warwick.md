Gotta get off, gonna get Have to get off from this ride
Gotta get hold, gonna get Need to get hold of my pride
When did I get, where did I
How was I caught in this game
When will I know, where will I
How will I think of my name

When did I stop feeling sure, feeling safe
And start wondering why, wondering why
Is this a dream, am I here, where are you
What's in back of the sky, why do we cry

Gotta get off, gonna get Out of this merry-go-round
Gotta get off, gonna get Need to get on where I'm bound
When did I get, where did I Why am I lost as a lamb
When will I know, where will I How will I learn who I am
Is this a dream, am I here, where are you
Tell me, when will I know, how will I know
When will I know why?
