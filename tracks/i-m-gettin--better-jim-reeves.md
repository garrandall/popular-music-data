I walked by the river
Where we said goodbye
Thought of your kisses
And didn't even cry
I'm gettin' better, I'm gettin' better

I talked with an old friend
He asked about you
I managed to tell him
With just a tear or two
I'm gettin' better, I'm gettin' better

I know I'll never be the same
I was standin' too close to the flame
But it doesn't hurt so much
To hear your name
I think I'll make it, I'm gettin' better...
