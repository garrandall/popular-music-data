Oh yeah, oh

She held me close, spoke my name
I felt the sun melt the rain
As I lay there with her picture
On my shoulder

There in the shadows
There in her room
Under the light of the neon moon
I could feel her memory
Growing colder

She said, "Once
Once we had a purpose
Once, once we had a song
Once the feeling disappears
It's all gone"

Don't walk, don't walk, don't walk away
The last words she heard me say
Don't walk, don't walk away
Yeah, from love, from love

I saw the tears
Move down her face
I saw the love
Good love gone to waste
And it cut me so deep and I knew
I couldn't keep her forever

Turning the pages
Breaking ties
That far away look
Deep in your eyes
It was over and done
You were on the run
Come the morning

She said, "Once
Once we had a purpose
Once, once we had a song
Once the feeling disappears
It's all gone"

Don't walk, don't walk, don't walk away
The last words she heard me say
Don't walk, don't walk away
Yeah, mmm, from love, oh, from love

She said, "Once
Once we had a purpose
Once, once we had a song
Once the feeling disappears
It's all gone, gone, gone"

Don't walk, don't walk, don't walk away
The last words she heard me say
Don't walk, don't walk away
Yeah, mmm, from love, oh, from love

Don't walk away from love
Don't walk away from love, yeah

I saw the tears
Running down her face
I saw the love
Good love gone to waste

Don't walk, don't walk away
Don't walk, don't walk away
Please, yeah
