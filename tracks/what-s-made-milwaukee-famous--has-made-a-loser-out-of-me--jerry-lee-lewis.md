It's late and she's waiting
And I know I should go home
But ev'ry time I start to leave
They play another song
Then someone buys another round
And with every drink or three
What Made Milwaukee Famous
Has made a fool out of me

Baby's begged me not to go
So many times before
She said love and happiness
Can't live behind those swinging doors
Now she's gone and I'm to blame
Too late, I finally see
What's Made Milwaukee Famous
Has made a fool out of me

Baby's begged me not to go
So many times before
She said love and happiness
Can't live behind those swinging doors
Now she's gone and I'm to blame
Too late, I finally see
What's Made Milwaukee Famous
Has made a fool out of me
