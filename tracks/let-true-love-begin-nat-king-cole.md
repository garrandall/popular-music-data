When you're young
You're afraid of the dark
Then you grow up
Unafraid of the dark

So, darling, when I kiss you
And your heart goes in a spin
Don't be afraid
Let true love begin

Oh, when you're alone
You're afraid that it's true
Love won't come
It won't hapoen to you

So to let this chance
For happiness go by
Would be a sin
Don't be afraid
Let true love begin

I know the feeling
That you're feeling is new
And your heart still
Wants to hide

This feeling that
Sends you reeling
I'm feeling too
It's love, it cannot be denied

So take my hand
I'll always be at your side
There's no need
For you to hide

So listen to your heart that's
Telling you from deep within
Don't be afraid
Let true love begin

Don't be afraid
Let true love begin
Don't be afraid
Let true love begin
