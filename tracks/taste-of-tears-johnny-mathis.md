City looks bright tonight
Dream and thrills and
Variety is the sweet taste of life
A chance to trip the light
There's a feeling in the air
Amongst the people, yeah I swear
All majestic in the light
This fantastic life
Should be revealed tonight

Tonight, tonight, tonight
If you've ever been alone
Find some love in the night
well, tonight, yea tonight, tonight
If you've ever lost your life
Find some love in the night

Black neon hangover in the morning
But i'm still smilin
Just a small price to pay
To wash my tears away
And I know I'm here to stay

Tonight, tonight, tonight
If you've ever been alone
Find some love in the night
well, tonight, yea tonight, tonight
If you've ever lost your life
Find some love in the night

If you're going down
Or if you're going around again
You better listen up
If you're going down
Or if you're coming around again
You better listen

Tonight, tonight, tonight
If you've ever been alone
Find some love in the night
well, tonight, yea tonight, tonight
If you've ever lost your life
Find some love in the night
