I thought I knew you well
But all this time I could never tell
I let you get away
Haunts me every night and every day

You were the only one
The only friend that I counted on
How could I watch you walk away
I'd give anything to have you here today

But now I stand alone with my pride
And dream that you're still by my side

But that was yesterday
I had the world in my hands
But it's not the end of my world
Just a slight change of plans

That was yesterday
But today life goes on
No more hiding in yesterday
'Cause yesterday's gone

Love, my love I gave it all
Thought I saw the light
When I heard you call
Life that we both could share
Has deserted me
Left me in despair

But now I stand alone with my pride
Fighting back the tears I never let myself cry

But that was yesterday
Love was torn from my hands
But it's not the end of my world
Just a little hard to understand

That was yesterday
But today life goes on
You won't find me in yesterday's world
Now yesterday's gone

Goodbye yesterday
Now it's over and done
Still I hope somewhere deep in your heart
Yesterday will live on
