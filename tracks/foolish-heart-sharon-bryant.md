Oh oh..

I need a love that grows
I don't want it unless I know
With each passing hour
Someone, somehow
Will be there ready to share

I need a love that's strong
I'm so tired of being alone
But will my lonely heart
Play the part of a fool again
Before I begin

Foolish heart
Hear me calling
Stop before
You start falling

Foolish heart
Heed my warning
You've been wrong before
Don't be wrong anymore, oh

Baby boy

I'm feeling that feeling again
And I'm playing the game
I can't seem to win

Love's knocking on the door
Of my heart once more
Think I'll let him in
Before I begin

I need, I need a love
That's strong (I need it)
I'm so tired of being alone
But will my lonely heart
Play the part of a fool again
Before I begin

Foolish heart (foolish heart)
Hear me calling (hear me calling)
Stop before
(Stop before you start falling)
You start falling

Foolish heart
Heed my warning
You've been wrong before, oh

Foolish heart (foolish heart)
Hear me calling
(Hear me calling, calling)
Stop before
(Stop before you start falling)
You start falling

Foolish heart
Heed my warning
(Heed my warning)
You've been wrong before
(You've been wrong)
(You've been wrong)

Foolish heart
Foolish, foolish heart, oh
You've been wrong before
And I can't take anymore

Foolish heart
(No, no, no, no...)
Hear me calling
Stop before
You start falling

Foolish heart (foolish heart)
Heed my warning
(Heed my warning)
You've been wrong before
(You've been wrong before)

Foolish heart
(Foolish, foolish, foolish
(Foolish, foolish, foolish heart)
You've been wrong before

Foolish heart
Please don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
