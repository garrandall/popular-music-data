She's been with a lot of dickhead niggas in the past (Truss)

She holds my tool for me, And more time I ain't even gotta ask, (Loyal)

She reminds me of my Rambo, were never apart, (Never)

We ain't no normal couple, we don't chill up in the park, (Bun Dat)

My girl the type to go and do some drillings after dark, (Bap!)

When I tell her do the dirt, she happily let it blast

After we get down an opp, we happily drink a glass

She's my ride or die, I could never leave her ass (Never)

And on our honeymoon she just wanna do some dippings (Dip Dip)

Trap Queen too, always got the nittys itching

And when she in the kitchen, she's certi with the whipping (Loves it)

She's always got it on her, don't you ever think she's slipping

Rambo girl never been a fighter

Scratches on my back when I'm up inside her

Hands on waist when I'm all behind her

If I was ever locked, she'll be my top provider

But let's not talking about the riding (Let's not)

And Let's not talk about the violence (Let's not)

She'll put an opp boy straight down to silence (M him off!)

She does up peds and she ain't even got a license (Nil)

South East to South West that's our island (That's Our Land)

Me and her, were both fly like a pilot (We're Fly)

For me she'll splash you in your face until you're eyeless (until your faceless)

She's just like me, after the dirt she starts smiling (She's love it)

She don't do none of that complaining and whining (None of that)

Chicken Cottage And Morleys where we go dining (That's our Nando's)

And every argument we have, we end up piping (Man bruk it out!)

She a Trap Queen too, if you need hiring (If you need that!)

I got love for her, I know she got love for me too (I Know)

She in the passenger, with the mash and the Malibu (With the burner!)

She the type of girl to come lock off your BBQ (Lock it off!)

The amount of love I got for her, niggas don't have a clue (They don't)

Niggas don't have a clue (They don't)


Slow Down, I just wanna catch up to ya
Baby, turn around, cause the XL Coupe looks good to me
Baby, Slow Down, I've never seen anything so lovely
Baby, turn around and look at me through your rear view, cutie
