Tim and Bob
Bobby Valentino
Let's slow it down...it's the remix



I can tell you keep yourself
hair and nails done plus a good job
baby I can tell you from a good home
You're a leader and your head is strong
you're exclusive not many guys 
can say they tapped that 
and I like that put your brake on
I'm writing you a ticket 
with my name on it plus ten digets



I'm in your city just for the weekend
Relaxation is all I'm seekin'
this walkin' and talkin' ain't doin' it for me
so baby won't you please turn around and



slow down I just wanna know ya
slow down I just wanna know ya
slow down I just wanna know ya
slow down I just wanna know you
slow down I just wanna know ya
slow down I just wanna know ya
slow down I just wanna know ya
slow down I just wanna know you



Maybe one day we can share a last name
Take trips over seas just to celebrate
Whens your birthday I'm a Pisces
The right zodiac you can be my wifey
Just imagine dress track and
I'm in a tux and almost cryin'
We gettin' married private ceremony
on the beach just like you told yo mamma
yea yeah



I'm in your city just for the weekend
Relaxation is all I'm seekin'
this walkin' and talkin' ain't doin' it for me
so baby won't you please turn around and



slow down I just wanna know ya
slow down I just wanna know ya
slow down I just wanna know ya
slow down I just wanna know you
slow down I just wanna know ya
slow down I just wanna know ya
slow down I just wanna know ya
slow down I just wanna know you



Just a little while (talk to me)
baby I'm beggin' 
baby I'm beggin', beggin' baby
Just a little while (tell me)
baby I'm beggin' 
baby I'm beggin', beggin' baby
Just a little while (bless me with your beauty)
baby I'm beggin' 
baby I'm beggin', beggin' baby
Just a little while (baby)
baby I'm beggin' 
baby I'm beggin', beggin' baby



slow down I just wanna know ya
slow down I just wanna know ya
slow down I just wanna know ya
slow down I just wanna know you
slow down I just wanna know ya
slow down I just wanna know ya
slow down I just wanna know ya
slow down I just wanna know you

slow down I just wanna know ya
slow down I just wanna know ya
slow down I just wanna know ya
slow down I just wanna know you
slow down I just wanna know ya
slow down I just wanna know ya
slow down I just wanna know ya
slow down I just wanna know you
