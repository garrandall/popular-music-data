She got it

Ah-ah (Yeah, yeah)
Ah-ah (Yeah, yeah)
Hey!

I know she got it 'cause she lookin' at me like she want it (Want it)
She drop it low, maybe wanna throw some D's on it (Hey!)
Whatever it is, you can't stop it
'Cause she get low
When she on that pole
And that let's me know

Whoa-oh (She got it)

Shawty
She got it

Excuse moi, let me talk to you for a second
Little mama so fine she got the whole squad sweatin' (Damn!)
"How you fit all that in them jeans?"
Was the question that I asked
Followed by "Let me buy you a drink" (Drink)
Young boss baby, I treat you
Treat you to the finer things
The neck bling, wrist bling
Wedding ring (Nah, I'm playin')
Might light ya neck or your wrist
But you gotta ride a nice dick and, uh
Take trips with the bricks (Hey yeah)
"She got it (She got it)
She got it"
That's what Pain said (She got it)
Them other niggas lame man, little mama, I got the game plan
2 Pistols, bein' your boss

I make it happen while they talk
Ridin' 6's while they walk

I know she got it 'cause she lookin' at me like she want it (Want it)
She drop it low, maybe wanna throw some D's on it (Hey!)

Whatever it is, you can't stop it
'Cause she get low
When she on that pole
And that let's me know

She got it (She got it)
She got it (She got it)
She got it (She got it)
She got (She got it)
Oooh! (She got it)
She got it (She got it)
Whoa-oh (She got it)

Damn, she bad (Damn, she bad)
Damn, she thick (Yes indeed)
Five foot five, hazel eyes, redbone, you da shit (Shit)
Make a nigga wanna stop and stare (Stare)
I just wanna pull your hair
Freaky shit, kinky shit
You don't need to take it there
I'm a young boss, girl (Girl)
Let me upgrade ya (Ya)
He's a worker, I get work out, what you 'bout, girl (Girl)
Trips to Venice (Venice)
What's the bid'ness (Bid'ness)
Bet this, swiss the digits
And the rest is history

I know she got it 'cause she lookin' at me like she want it (Want it)
She drop it low, maybe wanna throw some D's on it (Hey!)
Whatever it is, you can't stop it
'Cause she get low
When she on that pole
And that let's me know
She got it (She got it)
She got it (She got it)

I see my superwoman, nobody can't do it like she can
And she got it, I'm tellin' you like nobody yeah
And I love the way she talk them lames out they dreams
Bestest thing in fresh Louis with the matching jeans
And I love the tatted down baby, I'm your fit
Can I be yo' appetizer, yo just her and me
Oh, she's on tonight, the baddest in the club
I grab that ass when she give me a hug 'cause

I know she got it 'cause she lookin' at me like she want it (Want it)
She drop it low, maybe wanna throw some D's on it (Hey!)
Whatever it is, you can't stop it
