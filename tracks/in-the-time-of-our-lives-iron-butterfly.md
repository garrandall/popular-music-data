I listen to the clock beat as it ticks out time away
And listen to the birds' laughter as they live for today
And listen to the heart beat as it beats our lives away

These are the things that we hear in our world
And these are the things that we hear in the time of our lives
In the time of our lives

And to us they are real
And for us they're ideal

How you doing people that passed on yesterday?
Did you meet with justice on your judgement day?

These are the things that we fear in our world
And these are the things that we fear in the time of our lives
In the time of our lives

And to us they are real
And for us they're ideal

Yes, to us
Without a doubt they're real

Without a doubt they're real

Without a doubt they're real
