(Sometimes you gotta close a door to open a window)

I saw a photo, you looked joyous
My eyes are green, I eat my veggies
I need to get her out the picture
She's really fuckin' up my frame
She's not developed like we are

(Like magic, like magic, like magic wand)
(New magic, new magic, new magic wand)
(Like magic, like magic, like magic wand)
(New magic, new magic, new magic wand)

My buddy said I'm on the spectrum
Don't call me selfish, I hate sharing
This 60/40 isn't working, I want 100 of your time, you're mine
Please don't leave me now, please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
Please don't leave me now, please don't leave me now (Don't leave)

(Like magic, like magic, like magic wand)
(New magic, new magic, new magic wand)
(Like magic, like magic, like magic wand)
(New magic, new magic, new magic wand)

I wanna be found, passenger in your car (Don't leave)
You wanna get me mixin', there's no pot (Can make her bleed)
She's gonna be dead, I just got a magic wand (Don't leave)
We can finally be together

You roll the dice, hit a 7, sure you're right, beginner's luck
You not my first, who gives a fuck?
Your other one evaporate, we celebrate
You under oath, now pick a side, and if you don't
I pick you both, it's not a joke
Murder, she wrote

Ayo, take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea that one day you won't be here
I will not fetch the ball, eyes are green I eat my vegetables
It has nothing to do with that broad, but if it did, guarantee she'd be gone (Well)
I got a plan 'bout to walk in the pen
If you can't understand I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest, that I need to get off or I ain't talking to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
Gon' let the world know, 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain't
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one, not the other one
Keep it on the low, I'm in my right mind, keep it on the high
Janis Joplin, spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em
Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store
Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned
New magic wand
