Only a nascent trying to harness huge fire
Out on the beach in the darkness starting bonfire
So gorgeous, a man might cry
Burning trees in the basement, start a cool fire
Feel my heartbeat racing, baby you're on fire
So gorgeous, a man might cry

Back in Paris you told me you were suicidal
It's not a vacation if I lose you to the Eiffel
You're gorgeous but you can't fly
A hidden admirer sent me roses white as fire
We took our handfuls it was war, flower fighter

Wildfire
Wildfire
Wildfire
Wildfire
