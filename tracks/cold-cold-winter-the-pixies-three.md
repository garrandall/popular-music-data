When we had to part
That's when I knew
Baby
It’s gonna be a cold cold winter without you

The snow is fallin' on the ground
The wind is blowin' all around
From June until September
I always will remember
But it’s a cold cold winter night

I miss those summer days with you
The silly things we used to do
And since we're not together
I need you more than ever
But it's a cold cold winter night

True, summer's great for havin' fun
But you

I sit at home and watch the storm
Wish you were here to keep me warm
Can't wait till next vacation
I'll see you when that day comes
But it's a cold cold winter night

Can’t wait till next vacation
I’ll kiss you when that day comes
But it's a cold cold winter night
Can’t wait till next vacation
I'll love you when that day comes
But it's a cold cold winter night
Can't wait till next vacation
I’ll love you when that day comes
