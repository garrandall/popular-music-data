I saw your eyes
And you made me smile
For a little while
I was falling in love

I saw your eyes
And you touched my mind
Although it took a while
I was falling in love

I saw your eyes
And you made me cry
And for a little while
I was falling in love

I was falling in love

I saw your eyes (I saw your eyes)
And you made me cry (And you made me cry)
For a little while (For a little while)
I was falling in love

I was falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love
