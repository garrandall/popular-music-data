I feel like I could run away
Looking at a darker day
Oh, I'm pulling the shades away from my eyes
It's true the moody manners come and go
And it's better that you never know

Some things are better left unsaid
Some strings are better left undone
Some hearts are better left unbroken
Some lives are better left untouched
Some lies are better off believed
Some words are better left unspoken

My ideas seem to frighten you
Are you really that afraid to move
Oh, I guess that it's your right to reason
I'm still dealing with a force that's so strong
The force is stringing us along

Some things are better left unsaid
Some strings are better left undone
Some hearts are better left unbroken
Some lives are better left untouched
Some lies are better off believed
Some words are better left unspoken

You're livin' a lie
It's only on the outside

Ooh, some things are better left
Some things are better left unsaid
Some strings
Some things are better left unsaid
Some lives are better
Some things are better left unsaid
Some hearts are better
Some things are better left unsaid
Some lies are better
Some things are better left unsaid

Some things are better left
Some things are better left unsaid
Some strings
Some things are better left unsaid
Some lives are better
Some things are better left unsaid
Some hearts are better
Some things are better left unsaid
Some lies are better
Some things are better left unsaid
