You swore you'd never again, let yourself be tempted
Too many times in the past when you've opened up your heart --
You've had it broken in pieces, by too many lies
Still it's hard to acknowledge the past --
When she flashes those eyes
Over and over the song skips
Just as the final refrain fades away --
Like fools we are caught in the game

*Caught in the game
Caught in the game again --
Caught in the game
Caught in the game*

I swore I'd never again catch myself believin'
Too many times I've been hurt -- and it makes you hard inside
But when I saw you in the city tonight --
Was it just imagination --
Or did your eyes burn a little too bright
For purely conversation --
Over and over the lights flash down at the corner arcade
Swept away --
Like fools we are caught in the game

( * Repeat)

Over and over the song skips
Just as the final refrain fades away
Like fools we are caught in the game

( * Repeat)
