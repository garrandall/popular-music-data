Maybe I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time
Maybe I'm afraid of the way I love you
Baby, I'm amazed at the way you pulled me out of time
You hung me on a line
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you


Baby, I'm a man and maybe I'm a lonely man
Who's in the middle of something
That he doesn't really understand
Baby, I'm a man and maybe you're the only woman
Who could ever help me
Baby, won't you help me understand?
Oh-ah


Baby, I'm a man and maybe I'm a lonely man
Who's in the middle of something
That he doesn't really understand
Baby, I'm a man and maybe you're the only woman
Who could ever help me
Baby, won't you help me understand?
Oh-ah


Maybe I'm amazed at the way you're with me all the time
Maybe I'm afraid of the way I leave you
Baby, I'm amazed at the way you help me sing my song
You right me when I'm wrong
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you

Oh, oh
Oh
Hey
Oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Yeah-yeaiyeah
Oh
