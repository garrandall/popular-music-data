When I was a young boy
they said you're only gettin' older
but how was I to know then
that they'd be cryin' on my shoulder
put your money in a big house
get yourself a pretty wife
She'll collect your life insurance
when she connects you with a knife

Somebody get the doctor,
I'm feelin' pretty poor,
somebody get the stretcher
before I hit the floor

Somebody save me

I lost my job, they kicked me out of my tree,

Somebody save me

save me

Everybody's got opinions
but nobody's got the answers
and the shit you ate for breakfast
well it'll only give ya cancer
We're runnin' in a circle
runnin' to the mornin' light
and if ya ain't quite workable
It's been one hell of a night

Somebody get the doctor,
I think I'm gonna crash
Never paid the bill
because I ain't got the cash

Somebody save me

I lost my job, they kicked me out of my tree,

Somebody save me

save me, look out

Save me

I lost my job, they kicked me out of my tree,

Somebody save me

Save me

Somebody save me

I'm goin' down for the last time, look out

Save me

Save me
