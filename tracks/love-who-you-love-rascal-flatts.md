I should have stolen every moment
Now there's a page
With not enough on it
Where we belong
I guess I'll never understand it
Why do we take it all for granted
Until it's gone
'Cause then it's gone


Love who you love
With all that you have
And don't waste the time
That flies so fast
Love who you love
And say that you do
Hold on as tight as they'll let you
Love who you love

Give all you've got
Like it's your last day
Your heart and soul
Before it's too late
And pull them in so close
Enough that they can feel it
With every single breath that 
You're breathing
Breathe it in again and again


Love who you love
With all that you have
And don't waste the time
That flies so fast
Love who you love
And say that you do
Hold on as tight as they'll let you
Love who you love

Hold on, hold on

Yeah, love who you love
Say that you do -- yeah


Love who you love
With all that you have
And don't waste the time
That flies so fast
Love who you love
And say that you do
Hold on as tight as they'll let you
Love who you love

Yeah, love
Love who you love
Say that you do
Hold on, keep on holdin' on -- yeah
Yeah, with every single breath
You're breathing
