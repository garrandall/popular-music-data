I was sitting in the coffee shop
Just minding my own affair
When all of a sudden, this
Policeman caught me unaware

Said, is your name Pedro
I says, yeah, I guess so
Said, then come with me cause
You're the man we been looking for

I said, hey, man
I been framed
Hey, no, really, man
I was framed

Aw, I never do nothing wrong, man
But every time I get the blame
I been framed

They put me in the lineup
And let the bright lights shine
There was ten poor dudes like me
Standing in that line

I knew I was the victim
Of somebody's evil plan
When this scroungy looking dude
Came up and said, yeah
That's him, man

Hey, wait a minute, man
I been framed, man
Aw, listen to me, judge
I was framed

I never do nothing wrong
But every time I get the blame
Hey, I been framed

Then the prosecuting attorney
Started prosecuting on me
That dude gave me the first
Second, and third degree

He said where were you
On the night of July 29
I said, man, I was home in bed
He said, judge, that man's lying

I said wait a minute, man
I was framed, man
Hey, judge, listen to me, man
Really, you gotta believe me
I been framed, man

I never do nothing wrong
But every time I get the blame
Oh, I was framed

Now look, I deny the charges
Of having any weed
And I also deny the charges
Of taking any speed

I deny the charges
Of selling any grass
But when the judge
Looked down and said guilty
I said, judge, you can kiss my

Framed
Judge, I'm telling you the truth
I was framed, man

I never do nothing wrong
But every time I get the blame
Hey, I was framed

Oh, framed
You gotta believe me, judge
That wasn't even my stuff
I was holding it for a friend, man

Could this face life, man
Oh, come on, judge
Don't send me to camp, man
I just got my car fixed, man

Look, I just got a new
Tattoo and everything, man
Oh, man, what a bummer, man

Oh, come on, judge
Gimme a break, please
Aw, judge, come on, man
Don't take me away, I was framed
Man, really I been framed
