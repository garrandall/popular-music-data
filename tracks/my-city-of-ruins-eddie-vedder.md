There's a blood red circle
On a cold dark ground
And the rain is falling down
The church doors thrown open
I can hear the organ's song
But the congregation's gone

My city of ruins
My city of ruins

Now the sweet veils of mercy
Drifting through the evening trees
Young men on the corner
Like scattered leaves
The boarded up windows
The empty streets
While my brother's down on his knees

My city of ruins
My city of ruins

Come on rise up!
Come on rise up!
Come on rise up!
Come on rise up!
Come on rise up!
Come on rise up!
Come on rise up!

Now there's tears on the pillow
Darling where we slept
And you took my heart when you left
Without your sweet kiss
My soul, is lost my friend
Now tell me how do I begin again?

My city's in ruin
My city's in ruin

Now with these hands
With these hands
Oh with these hands
With these hands
I pray Lord
With these hands
Pray for the strength Lord
With these hands
Pray for the love Lord
With these hands
Pray for the lost Lord
With these hands
Pray for the strength Lord
With these hands
Pray for the strength Lord
With these hands

I
Come on Come on Come on Come on
Come on rise up!
Come on rise up!
Come on rise up!
Come on rise up!
Come on rise up!
Come on rise up!
Come on rise up!
Come on rise up!

Come on Rise up
