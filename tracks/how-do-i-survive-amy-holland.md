I'm not strong enough
Just to smile and make things easy
I can't put on that brave face anymore

I always took it for granted
That I could take whatever you gave me
I guess you never really know for sure

'Cause there was never a doubt in my mind
How it was meant to be
So who do I turn to darlin' if you should leave me?

How Do I Survive, if you break my heart?
How Do I Survive, if you break my heart?

I've got no excuses for being your fool
I never thought that it would be forever
But after so much time together, I've come to depend on you
What else am I supposed to do?

'Cause there was never a doubt in my mind
It wouldn't be easy
But I never realized how much you mean to me

How Do I Survive, if you break my heart?
How Do I Survive, if you break my heart?

(saxophone solo)

But there was never a doubt in my mind
How it was meant to be
So who do I turn to darlin' if you should leave me?

How Do I Survive, if you break my heart?
(How Do I Survive)
How Do I Survive, if you break my heart?
(If you break my heart)
How Do I Survive
(How Do I Survive)
If you break my heart?
(If you break my heart)
