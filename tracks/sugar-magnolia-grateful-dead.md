Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming, heads all empty, and I don't care.
Saw my baby down by the river; knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on. Under the willow, we can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

She's got everything delightful. She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double. Pays my ticket when I speed

She comes skimmin' through rays of violet. She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come, and I don't follow. Waits backstage while I sing to you

Well, she can dance a Cajun rhythm. Jump like a willys in four wheel drive
She's a summer love for spring, fall, and winter. She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia ringing that bluebell, caught up in sunlight, come on out singing;
I'll walk you in the sunshine. Come on honey. Come along with me

She's got everything delightful. She's got everything I need:
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight. Lazing in the sunshine? Yes, indeed

Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying, when the moon is half way down...
Sometimes when the night is dying, I take me out, and I wander around. I wander 'round

Sunshine daydream walking in the tall trees, going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose, breathing more freely
Ride our singin'; I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, Sunshine daydream walking in the sunshine
