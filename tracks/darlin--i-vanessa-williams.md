Oh, oh
Oh, oh.
Oh, ohoh, oh, ohoh, ohoh

I realized that now our love has past.
Tried so hard to make it last.
Feelings are far gone.
They just seem to fade away,
But yet I can hear him say we did try,
Tried our best to make it through those times.
Let's stop, don't go any further,
'Cause I need some time.

Darlin', I know you never meant to make me cry. (Me cry)
I never understood your reasons why.
And darlin', I know you never meant to make me cry. (Me cry)
Those lonely nights without you,
I guess it's goodbye.
Oh.

I never thought that I could hear you say
How I should go my own way.
Tell me, can't you see the changes that you put me through.
I wonder if you really knew how I tried, (We tried)
Tried my best to make it through these times.
But you said stop, don't go any further,
'Cause I need more time. Oh, baby.

And darlin', I know you never meant to make me cry. (Me cry)
I never understood your reasons why.
Oh, oh, oh, darlin', I know you never meant to make me cry. (Me cry)
Those lonely nights without you,
I guess it's goodbye. Goodbye.

Oh...oh. (Darlin', I)
You never meant to make me cry.
I never understood your reasons why.
Oh, oh, oh, darlin', I, you never meant to make me cry.
Tell me why, tell me why. Why. Oh, oh.
(Darlin', I) Woo, hoo, yeah.
You never meant to make me cry.
Don't say goodbye.
