No I didn't think you would let me down that easy
Oh no girl
And I didn't think it was over until you walked away
Like it was nothing, baby

And that moment was so hard for me to breathe, yeah
Cause you took away the biggest part of me, yeah
Life is so unpredictable, yeah
Never thought a love like yours would leave me all alone oh no

Didn't waste any time
Like you had already made up your mind
No sympathy
Cause I was out of line, oh yeah

But I didn't think you would let me down that easy
Oh no girl
And I didn't think it was over until you walked away
Like it was nothing girl

It was a bad day!
Hey hey hey...
I know I was wrong
But you could've said goodbye baby
It was a bad day
Now I'm like whoa

It was a bad day
It was a bad day
It was a bad day
