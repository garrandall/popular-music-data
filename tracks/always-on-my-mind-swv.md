You're always on my mind 


Boy, I can't seem to get you outta my head
But there's something about you that makes me smile
Don't change, I like the way you make me feel
Can we take our time and do this for a while


Girl, I never thought I'd find someone to love me
Now, you're the only one I want in my life
And the special touch you give comes from you only
I guess that's why you're always on my mind


You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind


Sometimes, I find it hard to concentrate
Because thoughts of us together fill my head
When you're away, it's hard to sleep at night
So, my pillow, like my thoughts of you, I hold tight


Girl, I never thought I'd find someone to love me
Now, you're the only one I want in my life
And the special touch you give comes from you only
I guess that's why you're always on my mind




Thinking 'bout ya, thinking 'bout ya, I can't stop thinking 'bout ya
(On my mind)
