Get on your mark, get set
Ready or not here I come
You've been looking for love
Well honey, I can give you some
When your world is standing still
I can turn it around
Put your head up in the clouds
And pick your feet off the ground


My love
Are you ready for my love, my love
My love, my love is ready for you
If you're looking for a heart that's always true
Only to you, then my love
My love, my love is ready for you

Girl, I've heard it said
That love is good for the soul
I see the hunger in your eyes
Burning out of control
My love is overflowing from a loving cup
Girl, I know you're down
But love will lift you up



My love is overflowing from a loving cup
Girl, I know your're down
But love will lift you up



My love, my love is ready for you...
