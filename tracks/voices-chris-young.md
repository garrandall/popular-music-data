You could say I'm a little bit crazy
You could call me insane
Walkin' 'round with all these whispers
Runnin' 'round here in my brain

I just can't help but hear 'em
Man, I can't avoid it
I hear voices
I hear voices like

My dad sayin', "Work that job
But don't work your life away"
And mama tellin' me to drop some cash
In the offerin' plate on Sunday

And granddad sayin', "You can have a few
But don't ever cross that line"
Yeah, I hear voices all the time

Turns out I'm pretty dang lucky
For all that good advice
Those hard-to-find words of wisdom
Holed up here in my mind

And just when I've lost my way
Or I've got too many choices
I hear voices
I hear voices like

My dad sayin', "Quit that team
And you'd be a quitter for the rest of your life"
And mama tellin' me to say a prayer
Every time I lay down at night

And grandma sayin', "If you find the one
You better treat her right"
Yeah, I hear voices all the time

Sometimes I try to ignore 'em
But I thank God for 'em
'Cause they made me who I am

My dad sayin', "Work that job
But don't work your life away"
And mama tellin' me to drop some cash
In the offerin' plate on Sunday

And granddad sayin', "You can have a few
But don't ever cross that line"
Yeah, I hear voices all the time
Yeah, I hear voices all the time
All the time
