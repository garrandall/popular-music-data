(I just don't know what else to say baby
There's really nothing left to say
There's really nothing more I can say
But I love you, listen;
Yeah...
I love you...
I love you...
Listen)


Since you came inside my life
You've given me the best of you everyday and night
I felt my happiness in you
Make me wanna ride to the end of any valley
Then you give me piece of mind
You bring me comfort to my soul give me such a high
No I will never let you go
Make me wanna fly to the top of every rainbow


I love you more everyday
You show me love in every way
There's nothing left for me to say
But I love you
I love you more everyday
You show me love in every way
There's nothing left for me to say
But I love you (more and more everyday)


So promise you will never leave
You never say this is the end you'll spend your life with me
You'll be my wife and my best friend, raise a family
Something we both can treasure
Ohyeah
In the mean time
I'm gonna put in work
You gonna be fine
You never have to work
So won't you come and fly with me
Forever you and me
That's how it's suppose to be
I love you every


I love you more everyday
You show me love in every way
There's nothing left for me to say
But I love you
I love you more everyday
You show me love in every way
There's nothing left for me to say
But I love you (more and more everyday)


I won't stop loving you
And I won't stop kissing you
You're the reason why I smile
And I won't stop holding you
And I won't stop loving you
You're the reason why I smile


I love you more everyday
You show me love in every way
There's nothing left for me to say
But I love you
I love you more everyday
You show me love in every way
There's nothing left for me to say
But I love you
I love you more everyday
You show me love in every way
There's nothing left for me to say
