It's my birthday, and he forgot again
Every time we date, he's always late
All the abuses and excuses, I've made up my mind
Gonna tell him this time we're through
But everything I plan to say
Just seems to fade away
Every time I see his face
My eyes light up, sparks start to flyin'
Like a live wire, real live wire
Just like a bolt of lightnin', it sets my soul on fire

Sweet kisses are his alibi
And that's why, that's where my weakness lies
Though I plan and rehearse the things I want to say
The words never never come my way, 'cause
'Cause everything I plan to say
Just seems to fade away
Every time I see his face
My eyes light up, sparks start to flyin'
Like a live wire

Like a bolt of lightnin', it sets my soul on fire
Just like a live wire, real live wire
A bolt of lightnin', oh yeah, sets my soul on fire
Like a live wire, real live wire
