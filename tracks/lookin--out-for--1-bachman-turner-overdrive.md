Every day is an endless train
You got to ride it to the end of the line
Be a troubleshooter, blow the bad luck away
And you will make it to your station on time

And you'll find out every trick in the book
And that's there's only one way to get things done
You'll find out the only way to the top
Is looking out for number one
I mean you keep looking out for number one

Every night is a different game
We gotta work for our fortune and fame
Success is a ladder, take a step at a time
And the people will remember your name

Yes, I found out all the tricks of the trade
And that's there's only one way you're gonna get things done
I found out the only way to the top
Is looking out for number one
And that's me, I'm looking out for number one

Every day is an endless train
But I ride it to the end of the line
I'm a real troubleshooter and I blow it away
No one's gonna get what's mine

I found out every trick in the book
And that's there's only one way to get things done
I found out the only way to the top
Is looking out for number one
I mean you, keep looking out for number one
That's us, keep looking out for number one
That's me, I'm looking out for number one
