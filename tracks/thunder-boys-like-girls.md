Today is a winding road
That's taking me to places that I didn't want to go
Whoa (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Today in the blink of an eye
I'm holding on to something and I do not know why
I tried
I tried to read between the lines, I tried to look in your eyes
I want a simple explanation for what I'm feeling inside
I gotta find a way out
Maybe there's a way out


Your voice was the soundtrack of my summer
Do you know you're unlike any other?
You'll always be my thunder
And I said, "Your eyes are the brightest of all the colors"
I don't wanna ever love another
You'll always be my thunder
So bring on the rain
And bring on the thunder


Today is a winding road
Tell me where to start and tell me something I don't know
Whoa (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Today I'm on my own
I can't move a muscle and I can't pick up the phone
I don't know (I don't know, I don't know, I don't know)
And now I'm itching for the tall grass and longing for the breeze
I need to step outside just to see if I can breathe
I gotta find a way out
Maybe there's a way out


Your voice was the soundtrack of my summer
Do you know you're unlike any other?
You'll always be my thunder
And I said, "Your eyes are the brightest of all the colors"
I don't wanna ever love another
You'll always be my thunder
So bring on the rain


Yeah, I'm walking on a tightrope
I'm wrapped up in vines
I think I'll make it out, but you just gotta give me time
Strike me down with lightning, let me feel you in my veins
I wanna let you know how much I feel your pain


Today is a winding road
That's taking me to places that I didn't want to go
Whoa


Your voice was the soundtrack of my summer
Do you know you're unlike any other?
You'll always be my thunder
And I said, "Your eyes are the brightest of all the colors"
I don't wanna ever love another
You'll always be my thunder
And I said, "Your voice was the soundtrack of my summer"
Do you know you're unlike any other?
You'll always be my thunder
So bring on the rain


Oh baby, bring on the pain
And listen to the thunder
