Tired of bein' pushed, bumped and turned around
Listenin' to the people fightin' next floor down
Tryin' to find fresh air to breathe just can't be done, no
I gotta get away and get some country sun
Look to the sky, the stars are outta sight
Hidden by the cloud of the city's might
Hear the sirens blowin' all over town
Well, now I gotta get away and get some country sound
Take it slow and take it easy, lots of time for livin'
Get out on the road and take a big load off your mind
Out in the country, your time's your time
And you know that you'll be feelin' right
Layin' in grass that's over two feet tall
Well, now I'm feelin' good, I'm feelin' clean, I'm feelin' small
Breathin' this air can really stone the brain
Like bein' lost and findin' your way again
Look to the sky, the stars are shinin' bright
The smile on the moon just helps to light the night
Sittin' doin', nothin' is bad they say, ha
But sittin' here doin' nothin' keeps me busy all day
Take it slow and take it easy, lots of time for livin'
Get out on the road and take a big load off your mind
Out in the country, your time's your time
Out on the road, take a load off your mind
Out in the country, your time's your time
Out on the road, take a load off your mind
Out in the country, your time's your time
Out on the road, take a load off your mind
Out in the country
