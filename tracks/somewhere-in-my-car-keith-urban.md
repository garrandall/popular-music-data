I'm driving home tonight, catching all red lights
That's alright 'cause I don't want to be alone
There's nobody waitin there, cold and empty bed
Words I wished I'd said come on the radio

Ooh, ooh, ooh, and I don't know why I do this to myself
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I know you're with someone else

But in my mind we're somewhere in my car
And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire
I never will forget, you grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
Fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
I'd give anything if I could bring you back ho o o o home

So, I've been sleeping 'til noon in the same bedroom
Where I once held you and it's breaking my heart
I should take down all those pictures from my wall
Promises we made won't fill this empty space

Ooh, ooh, ooh, and I don't know why I just can't let you go o o o
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I know you're never coming back

But in my mind we're somewhere in my car
And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire
I never will forget, you grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
Fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
I'd give anything if I could bring you back ho o o o home
If I could bring you back!

But in my mind we're somewhere in my car
And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire
I never will forget, you grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
I'd give anything if I could bring you back ho o o o home


Mmmm
If I could bring you back
Mmmm
Just close my eyes...
