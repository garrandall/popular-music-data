I lost someone, my love
Someone who's greater than the stars above
Someone, who I need
Someone who don't let my heart bleed
Someone, that's the one
That's the someone
That's the someone that I lost
I, I lost someone
A million to one
Ten thousand people
Under my Father's sun
We need someone
Someone, the only one
Just that someone who needs someone now
Under the sun
To care for, to care for
Just that someone now
Mmm, yeah

I got something I wanna tell everybody
And I got something I want everybody to understand now
You know we all make mistakes sometimes
And the only we can correct our mistakes
We got to try one more time
So I got to sing a song to you one more time
Now I want you to know I'm not singing a song for myself
I'm singing a song only for myself now
I'm singing it for you, too
And when I say something that make you feel good inside
When I say that little thing
I say that little part that might sting you in your heart now
I wanna hear you scream
I wanna hear you say OW!
