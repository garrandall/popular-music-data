You are beautiful
Soft and shy
You are the girl whose eyes met mind
Just as your boat sailed by

This I know of you 
Nothing more
You are the girl whose eyes met mine
Passing the river shore

You are the girl whose laugh I heard
Silver and soft and bright
Soft as the fall of lotus leaves
Brushing the air of night

While your flower boat
Sailed away
Gently your eyes looked back on mine
Clearly you heard me say
You are the girl I will love someday

While your flower boat
Sailed away
Gently your eyes looked back on mine
Clearly you heard me say
You are the girl I will love someday
