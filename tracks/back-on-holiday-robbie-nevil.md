It's quarter to nine
So tired I can barely move

No one's at work on time
I'll be there in an hour or two
Five days a week is absurd
A few days off in his crazy world
Is something I could use
I'm going -

Back on holiday
Isn't it time we had a vacation?
Back on holiday
Need a little rest and relaxation!

Pick up the phone
Tell the boss I'm not coming in

I'm busy taking it slow
No time to waste in a traffic jam
Morning
Noon and night I think I've paid my dues

Pack my bags and I'm ready to make my getaway
I'm going -

Back on holiday
Isn't it time we had a vacation?...

You know that sometimes life can turn into all work and no play

So if you feel like you need it just go back on holiday

Five days a week is absurd
A few days off in this crazy world
Is something I could use
I'm going -
