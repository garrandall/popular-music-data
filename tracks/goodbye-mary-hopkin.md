Please don't wake me up too late, tomorrow comes
And I will not be late
Late today when it becomes tomorrow
I will leave to go away

Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, my love
Goodbye

Songs that lingered on my lips excite me now
And linger on my mind
Leave your flowers at my door, I leave them for
The one who waits behind

Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, my love
Goodbye

Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, my love
Goodbye

Far away my lover sings a lonely song
And calls me to his side
When a song of lonely love invites me on
I must go to his side

Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, my love
Goodbye
