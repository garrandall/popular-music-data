Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy (Rah eh!)
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy (Rah eh!)
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy (Rah eh!)


Violence is an energy against the enemy
Well, violence is an energy (Rah eh!)
Bringing on the fury, the choir infantry
Revolt against the honor to obey (Oh eh, oh eh)
Overthrow the effigy, the vast majority
Well, burning down the foreman of control (Oh eh, oh eh)
Silence is an enemy against your urgency
So rally up the demons of your soul (Oh eh, oh eh)


Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy (Rah eh!)
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy (Rah eh!)


The insurgency will rise
When the blood's been sacrificed
Don't be blinded by the lies in your eyes
Say! (Oh eh, oh eh)
(Oh eh, oh eh)




Well, violence is an energy (Oh eh, oh eh)
Well, from here to eternity (Oh eh, oh eh)
Well, violence is an energy (Oh eh, oh eh)
Well, silence is the enemy
So gimme, gimme revolution!


Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy (Rah eh!)
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy (Rah eh!)
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy (Rah eh!)


Overthrow the effigy, the vast majority
Well, burning down the foreman of control (Oh eh, oh eh)
Silence is an enemy, against your urgency
So rally up the demons of your soul (Oh eh, oh eh)
