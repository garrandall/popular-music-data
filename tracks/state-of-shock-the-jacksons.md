You gotta be mine
'Cause you're so fine
Your butterfly style
It makes me wild
You take it to me good
You petrify my wood
Fall to your knees
Please, baby, please

Listen
She looked so great with or without her painted face
She puts me in a state
State of shock

Hey, hey!
She took it to her knees
My dick about to sneeze
I know you like to tease
Please, baby, please
You take it to me good
You petrify my wood
I love the way you walk
Don't make me stalk you

Listen
She looked so great with or without her painted face
She puts me in a state
State of shock

What up there, bitch?
Come over here
Uh-uh
Come over here, then (Yeah)
Come over here, bitch
You come over here!
Alright, then

You know I really love you, baby
You know I really want you, mama (Yeah)

You got me paralyzed (You got me paralyzed)
You got me catatonic (You got me catatonic, baby)
You got me supersonic (You got me supersonic, lady)
I'm deep fried (You know I'm deep fried)

Na na na na na na na na na na (Woo! Woo!)
Na na na na na na na na na na (Woo! Woo!)
Na na na na na na na na na na (Woo! Woo!)
Na na na na na na na na na na (Woo! Woo!)

Yeah, look what you've done to me
Look what you've done to me
Look what you've done to me
Yeah, I can hardly move. I think I need mouth-to-dick resuscitation

You put me in (Woo! Woo!)
Yeah
Yup! Yup! (Woo! Woo!)
Look at me
Look at me! (Woo! Woo!)
Look at me, bitch
Uh huh
You know I'm  (Woo! Woo!)

You got me in a state of shock
Place your lips up on my cock
Harder than a fucking rock
Fatter than a cinder block
I don't wear no Jimmy sock
Fixed with hydraulics like pock
Guaranteed, the boots I knock
Take my time, like tick-tock
Stick my key up in her lock
Shoot my load off like a Glock
Beat it, tap you out like Brock
Pussy walls smother my jock
Work that neden 'round the clock
Dick don't run, I more in stock
Pussy fishin' off the dock
That neden hunter, fuck a crock
Knock that pussy out like Spock
Copy porn, watch and mock
Bring your girls, I'll fuck the flock
Scared of skeet? Wear a smock
