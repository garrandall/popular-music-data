Yeah, come on, baby


You gotta be mine
'cause you're so fine
I like your style
It makes me wild
You take it to me good
You like it, know you should
You get me on my knees
Well, please, baby, please


Listen
She looks so great, every time I see her face
She put me in a state, a state of shock


Oh, do it
Come on, baby
Come on, baby
Come on, baby


She put me on my knees
Please, baby, please
I know you like to tease
Please, baby, please
You take it to me good
You like it, know you should
I love the way you walk
And talk, baby, talk


Listen
She looks so great, every time I see her face
She put me in a state, a state of shock


She put me, state of shock
Come on, dear, no, come over here
Talk, talk to me, state of shock
State of shock
You put me in
You know I've really love you, baby
State of shock
You know I really want you mama
You got me paralyzed
You got me paralyzed
You got me catatonic
You got me catatonic, baby
State of shock
You got me supersonic
You got me supersonic, baby
Baby, try, you know I'm deep fried
State of shock
Yeah, look what you've done to me
Look what you done to me
Look what you done to me
Yeah, I can hardly move
State of shock
You know I need mouth to mouth resuscitation
Come on, baby
You know I've really loved you, baby
State of shock
You know I've really want you for me
Yeah, baby, yeah, baby
Just look at me, look at me
State of shock
You drive me
You call me, you call me
You call me in a state of shock
Look at that, look at me
Look at me, look at me
Look at me, oh, look at me
