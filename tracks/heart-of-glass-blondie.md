Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out, had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, but only to find
Much of mistrust, love's gone behind

Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon found out I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing, but I was so blind
Much of mistrust, love's gone behind

In between what I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losing you
It's just no good, you teasing like you do

Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out, had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, but only to find
Much of mistrust, love's gone behind

Lost inside adorable illusion and I cannot hide
I'm the one you're using, please don't push me aside
We coulda made it cruising, yeah

It's just no good, you teasing like you do

Ooh ooh, wooh
Ooh ooh, wooh
Ooh ooh, wooh
Ooh ooh, wooh

Ooh ooh, wooh
Ooh ooh, wooh
Oh yeah
