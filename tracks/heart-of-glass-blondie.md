Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon found out I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind


In between
What I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losing you, it's just no good
You teasing like you do


Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind


Lost inside
Adorable illusion and I cannot hide
I'm the one you're using, please don't push me aside
We could've made it cruising, yeah


Yeah, riding high
On love's true bluish light


Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out to be a pain in the ass
Seemed like the real thing only to find
Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind


In between
What I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losing you, it's just no good
You teasing like you do
