Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
NLE the top Shotta
I got the bomb like Al-Qaeda

Get a bitch and make her famous, next minute she block me (Block me)
Thirty in this Perk, need to slow down on the Roxys
Got a call my nigga died I damn near skipped a heartbeat (damn near skipped a heartbeat a heartbeat)
Lookin' for your love, but your feelings is departing (your feelings is departin)
Pull up on the wrong street, you niggas getting blicked out
Gun up in my hand while I fuck her with my dick out (Dick out)
We was really in the trenches thugging in the choppa house (Choppa house)
Don't you tell me that it's smoke because you know that we gon' make it out (make it out)

I don't even know which car I'ma drive (Drive)
Roll a three-five now I'm too damn high (I'm too damn high)
Bitch I'm in my zone, don't you kill my vibe (Don't you kill my vibe)
If a nigga play, you know them choppas gon' ride (Ride)
The micro Draco clip, it look like a banana (Banana)
A niggas look wrong in this bitch, we gonna blam him (Grr, grr)
A lot of choppas when we ride, raise the count up (Raise the count up)
I robbed the corner store, the gun over the counter (Uh, uh, uh)
And I ain't gotta spin back because I know he dead
Ain't no surviving when you shoot a nigga right in his head
Paramedics asking questions 'bout that boy and the medsâ
But they know he ain't gon' make it so they pronounced him dead

Get a bitch and make her famous, next minute she block me (Block me)
Thirty in this Perk, need to slow down on the Roxys
Got a call my nigga died I damn near skipped a heartbeat (damn near skipped a heartbeat a heartbeat)
Lookin' for your love, but your feelings is departing (your feelings is departin)
Pull up on the wrong street, you niggas getting blicked out
Gun up in my hand while I fuck her with my dick out (Dick out)
We was really in the trenches thugging in the choppa house (Choppa house)
Don't you tell me that it's smoke because you know that we gon' make it out (make it out)

They gon' feel me, NLE the motherfuckin'...
NLE the top Shotta, yeah
Pull up on the wrong street, you niggas getting blicked out
Gun up in my hand while I fuck her with my dick out (Dick out)
We was really in the trenches thugging in the choppa house (Choppa house)
Don't you tell me that it's smoke because you know that we gon' make it out (make it out)
