It's not your situation
I just need contemplation
Over you
I'm not so systematic

It's just that I'm an addict for your love
I'm not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you
You're my only girl
I'm not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you

You're my only world
Georgy Porgy puddin' pie
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Georgy Porgy puddin' pie
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Georgy Porgy puddin' pie
Kissed the girls and made them cry

Kissed the girls and made them cry
Kissed the girls and made them cry

Just think how long I've known ya'
It's wrong for me to own ya'
Lock and key
It's really not confusion
I'm just the young illusion
Can't you see

I'm not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you
You're my only girl

I'm not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you
You're my only world

Georgy Porgy puddin' pie
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Georgy Porgy puddin' pie
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Georgy Porgy puddin' pie
Kissed the girls and made them cry

Kissed the girls and made them cry
Kissed the girls and made them cry
