The seasons come, the seasons go 
We get a little sunshine, rain and snow 
Just the way that it was planned to be 
But there's no seasons in my heart
While you play the leading part 
cause the flowers will bloom eternally. 

Your leaving, will bring autumn sorrow 
And my tears like withered leaves will fall 
But spring, it could bring some glad tomorrow 
And darlin' we could be happy after all. 

As it all is in natures' plan
No season gets the upper hand. Oh
How I tried to keep this fact in mind 
The trees are bare, the cold wind blows
And by experience I know 
That winter comes, but the spring is close behind. 

Your leaving, will bring autumn sorrow 
And my tears like withered leaves will fall 
But spring, it could bring some glad tomorrow 
And darlin' we could be happy.. after all...
