(Man, I was so drunk last night..
I was drinking shots off this fine, young killer
Motherfucker, that was me)

MONOXIDE!!


Iâm gone, but I.. (you gone, player)
I mean, I canât even feel my legs like Iâm froze
And I wanna get me dome,
But I canât even take her home
I wanna go, but my girl keep blowinâ up my phone
I donât give a fuck, though
Hand me a Dixie cup and a Red Bull
And I'mma mix it up with something special to make ya head go
Oh wee oh wee, oh wee oh wee
I just found a fuckinâ jar of weed in my car
I be rollinâ it, smokinâ it âtill Iâm up in a coma
Hopefully Iâll control the speed
Roll the window open and get the fuck up out the way
âCause I got throw up in the throat again
Iâm on a potion binge
Please quit all âemotioninââ
Itâs fuckinâ with my focus and
I need to see who the fuck it is Iâm smokinâ with
Sheâs askinâ me what I wanna do, and Iâm hopinâ hit
But Iâm too gone for this


Poppinâ pills and eatinâ shrooms
Give me molly and 'Bou Lou
JÃ¤ger Bombs and bong rips
Vicodins and that syrup shit
Come with us and then get undressed
See how wasted we can get
Come with us and then get undressed
See how wasted we can get
Get high, get drunk, get high,
Get drunk, get high,
Get WASTED!!
Puff, sip, puff sip, puff, sip,
Get WASTED!!


(Yeah..
I ate all the shrooms and I drank a fifth of Jack Daniels..
I canât feel my fucking hands..)


I got a bit of Tanqueray
Little bit of AlizÃ©
Put it in a cup and I fill it to the brim
Bottom to the skies, then I do it all again
Drink of champions, tell me who wanna contend
âCause I showed up drunk
Got a wet bar in the back of my truck
Crown Royal, Crystal Head, Seagrams Gin, Booneâs Farm, cold, dark
Get ya cup and shut the fuck
We âbout to party up
And sip and chug and drink
âTill somebody pass out or throw up
Bubble guts, Iâm soon to spew
How many drinks you had tonight?
Bartender said that 32 will slur your speech and blur your sight
36 will have you super pissy looking for a fight
And 50 will leave you holdinâ the toilet, puking for dear life
I grip the grass so my ass donât fall off the fuckinâ planet
Iâm drunk as ever but the plastered bitch donât understand it
I canât stand to stand up
âBout to piss, Iâm pissy drunk
Pour the rest of my liquor up into 20 sippy cups
Sip it slow and finish up
Ainât no quitter, listen up
Partyâs paused, but itâs back on
The very second I wake up


Poppinâ pills and eatinâ shrooms
Give me molly and 'Bou Lou
JÃ¤ger Bombs and bong rips
Vicodins and that syrup shit
Come with us and then get undressed
See how wasted we can get
Come with us and then get undressed
See how wasted we can get
Get high, get drunk, get high,
Get drunk, get high,
Get WASTED!
Puff, sip, puff sip, puff, sip,
Get WASTED!


Man, I woke up still higher than fuck
Man, I must have went to sleep with a hell of a buzz
Get twisted with Twiztid
It was ridiculous
Went to sleep with a thick bitch
And woke up with syphilis
Nasty.. in every sense of the word
Walkinâ in the waffle house about as high as a bird
B-b-b- back up off me, âcause I might puke
And there ainât no tellinâ what I might do
Iâm just like you, youâre just like me
Is he on some kind of pill?
I just might be
The room spinninâ, I think itâs time to go
Give me a couple seconds, and I might blow


(AJAX!!)


Iâm eatinâ Jerry Bears until Iâm barely there
Tripped my nuts off, landed in some chickâs derriere
Me and my hash rig make a scary pair
Stabbinâ globs on the skillet got these fairies scared
Yeah, Iâm purple hash wasted
Met this junkie hoe Katrina
Left the party at her manâs
She got drunk and stole the Beamer
I looked her in her eyes, said,
âGet comfy, hold the weinerâ
Then we slipped through the hood,
Vapinâ, bumpinâ Funky Cold Medina
Itâs âJax, bitch


(And it donât stop!)

Poppinâ pills and eatinâ shrooms
Give me molly and 'Bou Lou
JÃ¤ger Bombs and bong rips
Vicodins and that syrup shit
Come with us and then get undressed
See how wasted we can get
Come with us and then get undressed
See how wasted we can get
Get high, get drunk, get high,
Get drunk, get high,
Get WASTED!
Puff, sip, puff sip, puff, sip,
Get WASTED!


Gimme a jug of that Crowne
Guzzle that down
Whatâs the runner up?
Iâm trippinâ on that now
I can tell by the feeling in my stomach
Any little more of something
And Iâll be slumping
Iâll be hugging that ground
Yeah, you can tell that Iâm stumbling
I donât know how to act now
Had a few too many, bugging the act out
Drunk off my ass and I ainât fuckinâ sat down
That blurred vision
Iâm on one and Iâm lifted
Hit the dank mixed with that drank
Like Mad Mono, Iâm Twiztid
And Iâm gone
Not contemplating one conversation
Had too much drank
Get the fuck out my face, Iâm wasted


(Ladies and gentlemen.. BLAZE YA DEAD HOMIE!!)


Get basted, tipsy and wasted
Bitch, pop a molly and get naked
You can be my guest on the spaceship
We on that DMT with the aliens
Letâs get drunk, see double
Talk a little shit, I wanna start a lot of trouble
Burn trees, indeed, top speed,
Wanna see everybody turning green


Poppinâ pills and eatinâ shrooms
Give me molly and 'Bou Lou
JÃ¤ger Bombs and bong rips
Vicodins and that syrup shit
Come with us and then get undressed
See how wasted we can get
Come with us and then get undressed
See how wasted we can get
Get high, get drunk, get high,
Get drunk, get high,
Get WASTED!
Puff, sip, puff sip, puff, sip,
Get WASTED!


(Bottle of MoÃ«t? Check
Kilo of cocaine? Check
Box of condoms? Check)


(Bukshot)
Fuck the bullshit, homie
Letâs get wasted
Throwing down the hatchet
Watch me turn into a spaceship
(Blast off)
Sippinâ on this liquor got me lifted
(Cast off)
Talkinâ to a volley ball, Iâm Twiztid
Pull a pop cup full of vodka in the console
My head hurts like Daryl hit me with the crossbow
I saw Mono passing bottles like heâs Rondo
Jamie hit the bourbon like a Savage, call him Macho
Kush in the air, roaches in the ash tray
Life ainât fair, drinkinâ on a rampage
Cops ainât there, so we swervinâ in the fast lane
I donât care, slow motion like Iâm Max Payne
(Bukshot)
In the murder bucket, straight loaded
Naked bad bitches in the backseat, folded
My teamâs ready, it donât matter if they hate this
Tore up, laughing at your bitch
Weâre fucking wasted


Poppinâ pills and eatinâ shrooms
Give me molly and 'Bou Lou
JÃ¤ger Bombs and bong rips
Vicodins and that syrup shit
Come with us and then get undressed
See how wasted we can get
Come with us and then get undressed
See how wasted we can get
Get high, get drunk, get high,
Get drunk, get high,
Get WASTED!
Puff, sip, puff sip, puff, sip,
Get WASTED!


Iâm in Ann Arbor, Michigan
Ratchets all around me
OG white kush got the whole room cloudy
Smelling like a pound of that shit
When we walk up in the place
Me and Trevor G
Taking gram blunts to the face
Chugging molly cocktails
Iâm on my molly game shit
Fucked up at the hotel
Still there ainât a bitch I canât hit
Got crossed eyeballs
I can barely see where I am goinâ
Got 2 Xanax bars in my body
Now my heart rate is slowinâ
But I know Iâll be alright, I do this all the time
I actually live the life I rap about
In every one of these rhymes
Ask Twiztid, theyâll tell ya
Iâm a crazy motherfucker
Abominationz tour every night
Lil Wyte was slightly drunker
Ha ha haaa..


(Yeah, you right Lil Wyte
Now roll the motherfucking blunt
Iâll pour this motherfucking Crowne
We get wasted)


Poppinâ pills and eatinâ shrooms
Give me molly and 'Bou Lou
JÃ¤ger Bombs and bong rips
Vicodins and that syrup shit
Come with us and then get undressed
See how wasted we can get
Come with us and then get undressed
See how wasted we can get
Get high, get drunk, get high,
Get drunk, get high,
Get WASTED!
Puff, sip, puff sip, puff, sip,
Get WASTED!


I hear a lot of people jibber jabber
About doinâ this or that
(Johnny Richter!)
But me, Iâm only spittinâ facts
(Real knows real)
Itâs Richter teaming up with Twiztid
Twistinâ nothinâ but the biggest
Gettingâ lifted, we malicious
You not smokinâ? Thatâs suspicious
Writing rhymes in hieroglyphics
Munchinâ brownies, itâs delicious
 that ass, kick that ass, kid
Iâm losing my mind
But with the way Iâm looking, fuck it
Iâll just cook up some more crack
Drinkinâ vodka out the bucket
Mixed with heroin and smack
Me gettingâ sober? Thatâs hilarious
The joke of the year
Wrecked on the taste of getting wasted
I made it my career


Poppinâ pills and eatinâ shrooms
Give me molly and 'Bou Lou
JÃ¤ger Bombs and bong rips
Vicodins and that syrup shit
Come with us and then get undressed
See how wasted we can get
Come with us and then get undressed
See how wasted we can get
Get high, get drunk, get high,
Get drunk, get high,
Get WASTED!
Puff, sip, puff sip, puff, sip,
Get WASTED!


Here we go again
I canât see straight
Iâm Twiztid off of that Jack Daniels and that purple haze
Here we go again
Iâm fuckinâ retarded
From that Xanax, that Vicodin, that cocaine and Bacardi
Here we go again
Iâm fuckinâ up again
Iâm alienating my family and my closest friends
Iâm wasted
Feeling of out place and
Falling so hard, so hard, Iâm on my face again
Puffinâ that green shit
Sippinâ that mean shit
Smoking like a lunatic
I feel like Iâmma win again


(Can somebody get the paramedics over here, please?
This nigga doesnât have a pulse..
Can somebody call 911, please?
Aw damn..)


Poppinâ pills and eatinâ shrooms
Give me molly and 'Bou Lou
JÃ¤ger Bombs and bong rips
Vicodins and that syrup shit
Come with us and then get undressed
See how wasted we can get
Come with us and then get undressed
See how wasted we can get
Get high, get drunk, get high,
Get drunk, get high,
Get WASTED!
Puff, sip, puff sip, puff, sip,
Get WASTED!
