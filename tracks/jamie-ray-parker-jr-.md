Jamie used to be my girl
She used to be my girl
It's hard to imagine her
With someone else besides myself

Watch what you say about Jamie
'Cause she used to be my girl
I don't want to see her kissing
On one else besides myself

When you're loving Jamie
You got to hold her tight
'Cause she's the type of girl
That needs it every night every night

If you wondered how I should know
Let me tell you so
You see

Jamie used to be my girl
She used to be my girl
It's hard to imagine her
With someone else besides myself

So whatever you hear about Jamie
(Keep it to yourself)
'Cause she used to be my girl
Can't stand to hear about her
With no one else besides myself
Oh, Jamie, oh

Me and Jamie used to we used to be so close
Oh, oh out of all the girls I dated
I loved her the most
Her the most

Don't know how she got away from me
But I wish that I could make her see her see

Jamie used to be my girl (Jamie)
She used to be my girl
(Why won't you be my girl)

Jamie used to be my, she used to be mine (oh)
She used to be my girl

I trained her just the way I wanted her(I wanted her)
I taught her every trick in the book
It ain't fair for her to give all to
Some other guy Jamie you know you got me hooked

I'm hooked I'm hooked on your love baby
Jamie used to be my girl
She used to be my girl
I can't stand to see her with nobody else
'Cause I still want her for myself

Jamie used to be my girl Jamie Jamie
To me she's still my girl
Watch what you say to me Jamie
Watch who you're laying with Jamie
'Cause to me you're still my girl
Jamie Jamie Jamie
She used to be my girl
She used to be my girl Jamie Jamie
