Mama said get your ass out of bed
I said hell to the no
Said wash your grandma's nasty head
I said hell to the no

They tried to take away my tots
I said hell to the no
Yeah, 'cause I'm the one that calls the shots
And I say hell to the no

Try to make me change my weave
Well I got something up my sleeve
It's a whole lot of

Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hell to the no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no
I said
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hell to the no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no

I'm not trying to diva out
But this shows gotta stop so shout

Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hell to the no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no

Tell me I should eat my wheaties, you know what
Hell to the no (Hell to the no)
Tell me I'll come down with diabetes
Hell to the no (Hell to the no)

Try to make me change my eats
But baby that just isn't me
I'm a whole lot of

Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hell to the no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no
I said
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hell to the no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no

I'm not trying to diva out
But this shows gotta stop so shout

Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hell to the no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no

Take me you can leave me but I won't ever change
If you don't like the rules don't play my game
Talk to me to get R-E-S-P-E-C-T, but if I don't, it's all in me

Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hell to the no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no
I said
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hell to the no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no

I'm not trying to diva out
But this shows gotta stop so shout

Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hell to the no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no

I'm not trying to diva out
But this shows gotta stop so shout

Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hell to the no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no

Awe, hell to the no...
