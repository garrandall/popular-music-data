I can see what's happening (I can't, what?)
And they don't have a clue (Who's they?)
They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line
Our trio's down to two (Oh, I get it)
The sweet caress of twilight (Yep)
There's magic everywhere (It's everywhere)
And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disaster's in the air


Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things


So many things to tell her
But how to make her see
The truth about my past? Impossible
She'd turn away from me


He's holding back, he's hiding
But what, I can't decide
Why won't he be the king I know he is
The king I see inside?


Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things
Can you feel the love tonight?
You needn't look too far
Stealing through the night's uncertainties
Love is where they are


And if he falls in love tonight
It can be assumed
His carefree days with us are history
In short, our pal is doomed
