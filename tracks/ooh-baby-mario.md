I think this one's for the radio, oh, oh
Turn the lights on
Yeah, I think this one's for the radio
Baby, yeah


Hold on, don't say nothing
I just wanna make sure that your eyes are working
And what goes on here
Only concerns the two of us 'cause it's only the two of us

And I feel like it's 'bout time for me
To show you all, girl
All the freaky things that I'm thinking, baby


Your clothes are all off and the bed is right there
Besides your high heels all you're wearing is your hair
I could break it down for you if you not scared
Like oh oohohohby

Pleasure principle, can you work it in the chair?
And I can get you right with your legs up in the air
Now I can break it down for you if you not scared
Like oh oohohohby

Baby, baby, oh oohohohby
Baby, baby, oh oohohohby


It's been so long
Since somebody put it on ya like I'm 'bout to put it on ya
But let's make one thing clear
The things I'm 'bout to show you I already know you gonna love, girl

And it's gonna be so fun for me
To break you off, girl
Because I know just what your body needs, baby




I wanna hear your body say my name
Say my name
And you gon' be so happy
That you came over to get it, baby

So go on, get outta them clothes
Go 'head and go down over there on the floor
I'm dedicated to pleasing you
I know you're ready, baby
