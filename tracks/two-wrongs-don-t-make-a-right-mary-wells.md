Drunk with power (power, power, power) 


Aye yo, D-Double you can call me dash 
Dont talk no suck, bitch ass get slapped, 
pants sag, give a fuck like the president 
drop a bomb smoke a joint quicker then a gangsta step 
talk to me soft bout serve a muthafucka up 
turn into the double when I spit 
Cuz the heat from the fire burns ??
Fuck a pussy, dont make me start callin out names. 
Cause I dont really give a fuck about your claims. 
Calm down think before you speak. 
Put 'em in the state of mind now its plain deep. 
Its the D he gots no D, 
Stop fuckin with me I let the heat pop, 
let me in this punk muthafucka while the beat drop. 


Drunk with power (power, power, power) 
Pot resistance 
persue the life of liberty 
Drunk with power (power, power, power) 
Propostition 
resistance to the enemy 
Drunk with power (power, power, power) 
Pot resistance 
you'll never get the best of me 
Drunk with power (power, power, power) 
Proposition 
?? drug of industry 
Drunk with power (power, power, power) 
Pot resistance 
you'll never get the best of me 


Lately daily its kinda crazy 
once twice three times a lady 
Mary jane-zee she makes me hazy 
pigs roll bother dont wanna graze me 
it dont faze me cuz rhymes they pay 
I sing these songs till my dyin day. 
Lay stretched out flat in a cannabis coffin, 
So think of the offer when your packin your bong hits 
(Pot resistance) 
Daddy-x a last two rebel 
horny white devil, on another level 
(Pot resistance) 
I roll through with the east side flyin' 
change my sirens, politicians lyin. 
(Pot resistance) 
I keep grindin, politics is grindin 
In my vaporizer so I'm always vaporizen' 




Remember back in the day when they had probation 
now its a plant that'll end you up in prison 
whats your posistion on the status today 
alcohols good to go, but smoke some weed no way 
You get locked up they simpy throw away the keys 
Sounds like someones got a grudge, if you ask me 
it aint right, whos to say whats what. 
Call me wrong if I'm high while your drunk as fuck 
(Pot resistance) 
I aint givin in now and I wont give in never 
(Pot resistance) 
Alcohol takes lives, but pot no one dies. 
(Pot resistance) 
I aint givin in now and I wont give in never. 
(Pot resistance) 
alcohol takes lives, but pot no one dies. 

Drunk with power (power, power, power) 
Pot resistance 
persue the life of liberty 
Drunk with power (power, power, power) 
Propostition 
resistance to the enemy 
Drunk with power (power, power, power) 
Pot resistance 
you'll never get the best of me 
Drunk with power (power, power, power) 
Proposition 
?? drug of industry 
Drunk with power (power, power, power) 
Pot resistance 
Drunk with power (power, power, power) 
Pot resistance 
Drunk with power (power, power, power) 
Pot reisstance 
Drunk with power (power, power, power) 
Pot resistance 
Drunk with power (power, power, power)
