I can't sleep nights
Wishing you were here beside me
Can't help feeling
That's the way it ought to be
You know we could run (run, run) away
But I couldn't bear
To hear the things they'd say, oh no

Baby, let's pretend that tonight could live forever
If we close our eyes and believe it might come true
Baby, let's pretend we could always be together
But for now just let me spend the night with you

Somehow, someday
Things are gonna be so different
Don't cry, someway
I promise it'll be all right
So now that we're all alone
I couldn't bear
To leave to take you home, oh no

Baby, let's pretend that tonight could live forever
If we close our eyes and believe it might come true
Baby, let's pretend we could always live together
But for now just let me spend the night with you

So take me now
My love can't wait
We're almost there now, darlin', darlin'
Hold me (hold me), hold me (hold me)
Ho-oh-old me

Baby, let's pretend that tonight could live forever
If we close our eyes and believe it might come true
Baby, let's pretend we could always live together
But for now just let me spend the night with you

Baby, let's pretend that tonight could live forever
If we close our eyes and believe it might come true
Baby, let's pretend we could always be together
But for now just let me spend the night with you
