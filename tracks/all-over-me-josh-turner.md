Well the weather man says it's gonna be a hot one, heard it on the radio, 
Load up the boat, grab your girl if you got one, nice little breeze gonna blow, 
Baby I'm on my way to come and getcha, meet me at the end of your drive, 
Grab your shades and your string bikini and your Coppertone 45, 

Bring on the sunshine, bring on the good times, girl let me look at you, 
Jump in the front seat, kick up your bare feet, honey let your hair down too. 
I know a spot down on the river, underneath the Sycamore tree, 
Save all your kisses, but bring on your sweet love, pour it all over me 
All over me. 

We can build us a fire when we run out of daylight, let it light up your face, 
Lay on a blanket, listen to the river, get a little carried away 
Well I can take a side kiss on your sweet lips, ain't gonna want it to end, 
So when the morning comes, we'll roll on out, and do it all over again 

Bring on the sunshine, bring on the good times, girl let me look at you, 
Jump in the front seat, kick up your bare feet, honey let your hair down too. 
I know a spot down on the river, underneath the Sycamore tree, 
Save all your kisses, but bring on your sweet love, pour it all over me 
All over me. 

Bring on the sunshine, bring on the good times, girl just look at you, 
Jump in the front seat, kick up your bare feet, honey let your hair down too. 
I know a spot down on the river, underneath the Sycamore tree, 
Save all your kisses, but bring on your sweet love, pour it all over me 
All over me. 

Come on, 
Come on, 
Come on, 
Come on, 

Pour it all over me, 
All over me.
