You broke into my life
And stole my heart
Without a single clue
You fell apart
Well, now you're back again
You say you've changed
Well, I've got news for you
You're guilty just the same

'Cause now, it's my turn
Now, it's my turn
You hurt me then
I'll never let you hurt me again

Sweet surrender found me
On my knees
My eyes were full of love
I could not see
You left the scene of the crime
Hit and run
Well, don't think you'll get away
The pain has just begun

'Cause now, it's my turn
Now, it's my tun
You hurt me then
I'll never let you hurt me again, oh
It's my turn
Oh, you'll never learn
Just like me, you'll be
A casualty of your love

You have the right to remain silent
Anything you say can, will be used against you
In a court of love

Now, it's my turn
Now, it's my turn
You hurt me then
I'll never let you hurt me again, oh
It's my turn
Oh, you'll never learn
Just like me, you'll be
A casualty of your love
It's my turn
Oh, it's my turn
You hurt me then
I'll never let you hurt me again, oh
It's my turn
Oh, you'll never learn
Just like me, you'll be
A casualty of your love
