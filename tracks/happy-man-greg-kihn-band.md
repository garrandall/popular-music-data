I do not ask for much
Something real that I can touch
Someone there late at night
Someone there to hold me tight

You know I understand
Just what it takes
To be a happy man

I'm gonna be a happy man
Just you and me while we still can
There's nothing that we can't do
Me and you, a happy man

Some people need a lot
Others want what they haven't got
I need just what it takes
That's when the tension breaks

I'll be just what I am
Oh, oh, oh
A happy man

I'm gonna be a happy man
Just you and me while we still can
There's nothing that we can't do
Me and you, a happy man

I'm gonna be a happy man
Just you and me while we still can
There's nothing that we can't do
Me and you, a happy man

I'm gonna be a happy man
Just you and me while we still can
There's nothing that we can't do
Me and you, a happy man

A happy man
A happy man
A happy man

I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be
A happy man
