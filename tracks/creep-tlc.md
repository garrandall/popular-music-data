Yes it's me again
And I'm back
Oh I oh I oh I yeah
Oh I oh I oh I baby
Oh I oh I oh I yeah


The 22nd of loneliness and we've been through so many things
I love my man with all honesty, but I know he's cheating on me
I look him in his eyes but all he tells me is lies to keep me near
I'll never leave him down
Though I might mess around
It's only cause I need some affection


So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah, cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show, oh so I creep


The 23rd of loneliness, and we don't talk like we used to do
Now it seems pretty strange, but I'm not buggin'
Cause I still feel the same, yeah, yeah
I'll keep giving loving till the day he pushes me away
Never go astray
If he knew the things I did
He couldn't handle it
And I choose to keep him protected, oh


So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah, cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show, oh

So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low
(I think about us baby all the time)
Said nobody is supposed to know
(But you know that I'm gonna need some attention, yeah, yeah)
So I creep, yeah, cause he doesn't know what I do
(Love you forever, baby, soul and mind)
And no attention goes to show, oh
(And you gotta know it, if you don't give it, I'm gonna get mine)


(So I creep) Oh I oh I oh I, yeah
(So I creep) Oh I oh I oh I, yeah
(So I creep) Oh I oh I oh I, baby
Oh I oh I oh I, yeah


So I creep, yeah
(I creep around because I need attention)
I just keep it on the down low
(Don't mess around with my affection, yeah)
So I creep, yeah cause he doesn't know what I do
(I creep around because I need attention
Don't mess around with my affection, yeah)

So I creep, yeah, I just keep it on the down low
(Oh I oh I oh I, yeah, oh I oh I oh I)
So I creep, yeah cause he doesn't know what I do
(Oh I oh I oh I, yeah, oh I oh I oh I)

So I creep, yeah, just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention, goes to show oh so I creep
