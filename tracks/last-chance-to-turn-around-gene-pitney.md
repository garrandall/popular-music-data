The wheels of my old car
Are a'turnin, burnin' up the highway
Tonight that girl of mine
Will be yearnin' for not learnin' to see things my way

She hurt me for the very last time
I'm not hangin' around
I'll show her I can leave her behind
I'm gettin' out of town
I won't back down
I won't back down

Last exit to Brooklyn
Last chance to turn around
Last exit to Brooklyn
Gonna keep these wheels of mine coverin' ground

Last night I caught that girl
Lyin', tryin' to deceive me
And now all of these tears she's cryin'
I'm not buyin' you better believe me

She swore that she was mine alone
Our love would never die
I'm leavin' now for parts unknown
I saw her with that guy
That's the reason why
I'll be passin' by

The last exit to Brooklyn
The last chance to turn around
The last exit to Brooklyn
Gonna keep these wheels of mine coverin' ground
On the last exit to Brooklyn
The last chance to turn around
The last exit to Brooklyn
The last chance to turn around
...
