Baby will be my, corona and lime
And I will be your, main squeeze
And if your brother don't like my style,
We can take it to the street,
We can take it to the street


Yo, little girls in the city, dress up pretty
Go out and get messed up, get shitty
Girls by the sea, dress like hippies
And rock love beads and go skinny dippin'
Girls in the hills, go day trippin
To get their nails done and hair straightened
Little girls in the 818
Get hot when I roll over Laurel Canyon


Let me tell you bout a girl I know, 
She like hip hop and rock n roll
She walk slow down the avenue,
I ain't met her but I'll get her when I do
Let me tell you bout a girl I love,
She stay at home cuz she hate the club
Baby butt, pretty little features
I ain't met her but I'll get her when I see her




Girls from New York look like giraffes, 
Long neck long legs tiny tits and ass
Girls from L.A. rock oversized shades and chill all day cuz they already paid
Girls in Miami, street bikini's bump 
Techno by dj tiesto
Girls from Detroit like electro, 
and dance all night til' they break they neck yo


Let me tell you bout a girl I know, 
She like hip hop and rock n roll
Let me tell you bout a girl I love
Let me tell you bout a girl I love




Now if you lookin for love, won't you put your hands up 
If you lookin for love, won't you put your hands up
If you lookin for love then I'm lookin for love  
If you lookin for love then I'm lookin for love 
Now if you lookin for love, won't you put your hands up
If you lookin for love, won't you put your hands up
Now, if you lookin for love then I'm lookin for love, huh
And this is what I'm lookin for


Let me tell you bout a girl I know, 
She like hip hop and rock n roll
She walk slow down the avenue,
I ain't met her but I'll get her when I do
Let me tell you bout a girl I love,
She stay at home cuz she hate the club
Baby butt, pretty little features
I ain't met her but I'll get her when I see her




Baby will be my, corona and lime
And I will be your, sandy beach
And if your brother don't like my style,
We can take it to the street,
We can take it to the street
