The hills are alive
With the sound of music
With songs they have sung
For a thousand years
The hills fill my heart
With the sound of music
My hearts want to sing every song
It hears

My heart wants to beat
Like the wings of the birds that rise
From the lake to the trees
My heart wants to sigh
Like a chime that flies from a church
On a breeze
To a laugh like a brook
When it trips and falls over stones
On it's way
To sing through the night
Like a lark who is learning to pray

I go to the hills
When my heart is lonely
I know I will hear
What I've heard before
My heart will be blessed
With the sound of music
And I'll sing
Once
More
