And if she asks you why you can tell her that I told you
That I'm tired of Castles in the Air
I've got a dream I want the world to share an' castle walls
Just leave me to despair

Hills of forest green where the mountains touch the sky
A dream come true, I'll live there 'til I die
I'm asking you, to say my last goodbye
The love we knew, ain't worth another try

Save me from all the trouble and the pain
I know I'm weak but I can't face that girl again
Tell her the reasons why I can't remain
Perhaps she'll understand if you tell it to her plain

Oh, but how can words express the feel of sunlight
In the morning in the hills away from city strife
I need a country woman for my wife
I'm city born but I love the country life

For I will not be part of her Cocktail-Generation Partner's Waltz,
Devoid of all romance
The music plays and everyone must dance
I'm bowing out, I need a second chance

Save me from all the trouble and the pain
I know I'm weak but I can't face that girl again
Tell her the reasons why I can't remain
Perhaps she'll understand if you tell it to her plain

And if she asks you why you can tell her that I told you
That I'm tired of Castles in the Air
I've got a dream I want the world to share an' castle walls
Just lead me to despair
