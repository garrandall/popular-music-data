I've had a lot of big dreams
I've made a lot of bad moves
I know you could walk away
But you never do

I've met a lot of cold hearts
I've learned to smile and deceive
I know I'm hard to be around
But you never leave

I'm not easy to understand
But you hold out your hand

And you say you love me
Just as I am
You always treat me
The best that you can
You say you want me, need me
Love me, baby
Just as I am, just as I am

I've made a lot of heartaches
I've found a lot of closed doors
When all the others turn away
You love me more
You love me more

I'm not easy to understand
But you hold out your hand

And you say you love me
Just as I am
You always treat me
The best that you can
You say you want me, need me
Love me, baby
Just as I am, just as I am

I want to love forever
To keep our world together
And be the best that I can be
Baby, every time the world caves in on me

And you say you love me
Just as I am
You always treat me
The best that you can
You say you want me, need me
Love me, baby
Just as I am, just as I am
