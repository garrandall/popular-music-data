You are the crown of creation.
You are the crown of creation,
And you've got no place to go.

Soon you'll attain the stability you strive for,
In the only way that it's granted:
In a place among the fossils of our time.

In loyalty to their kind
They cannot tolerate our minds.
In loyalty to our kind
We cannot tolerate their obstruction!

Life is change.
How it differs from the rocks.
I've seen their ways too often for my liking.
New worlds to gain.
My life is to survive and be alive
for you.
