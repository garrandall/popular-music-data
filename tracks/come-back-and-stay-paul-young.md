Since you've been gone
I shut my eyes and I fantasize
That you're here with me
Will you ever return

I won't be you satisfied
'Til you're by my side
Don't wait any longer
Why don't you come back

Please hurry, why don't you come back
Please hurry
Come back and stay for good this time
Come back and stay for good this time
You said goodbye

I was trying to hide what I felt inside
Until you passed me by
You said you'd return
You said that you'd be mine

'Til the end of time
Don't wait any longer
Why don't you come back
Please hurry, why don't you come back

Please hurry

Come back and stay for good this time
Come back and stay for good this time
Since you've been gone
Opened my eyes and I realize

What we had together
Will you ever return
I'll have you change your mind
If you won't stay mine just love me forever

Love me forever
Why don't you come back
Please hurry, why don't you come back
Please hurry, why don't you come back
Please hurry, why don't you come back
Please hurry, why don't you come back
Please hurry
Just come back and stay for good this time
Come back and stay for good this time
Come back and stay for good this time
Come back and stay for good this time
Don't ever leave me
