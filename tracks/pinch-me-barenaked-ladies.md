It's the perfect time of year
Somewhere far away from here
I feel fine enough, I guess
Considering everything's a mess.
There's a restaurant down the street
Where hungry people like to eat
I could walk, but I'll just drive
It's colder than it looks outside.

It's like a dream - you try to remember but it's gone..,


 Hi folks this is Steven Page.
 This is Tyler Stewart.
 We're two members of Barenaked Ladies, and although you *thought*
you were downloading our new single,
what you're actually downloading is an advertisement for our new album 'Maroon',
comes out September 12th,
and after that point I'm sure you can download lots
of stuff from our record but until then you're just going to get lots of stuff with us bugging you.
 We fooled you, huh? We're sneaky like that...you can never trust a Canadian.
Next thing you know, we'll be supplying your natural resources!

...then ya try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn,
When ya try to see the world beyond your front door.

Take your time 'cause the way I rhyme's gonna make you smile,
When ya realise that with a guy my size it might take a while,
Just to try to figure out what all this is for.

It's the perfect time of day
To throw all your cares away
Put the sprinkler on the lawn
And run through with my gym shorts on.
Take a drink right from the hose
And change into some drier clothes
Climb the stairs up to my room
Sleep away the afternoon.

It's like a dream - you try to remember but it's gone,
Then ya try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn,
When ya try to see the world beyond your front door.


 Hello? Hi? H-? Hello? If you just- Would you- Could-
Could you please leave a m- Ah. If you'd just let me leave a -
At the sound of the - Uh. Ah. Thanks.

Take your time 'cause the way I rhyme's gonna make you smile, when ya
Realise that with a guy my size it might take a while, just to
Try to figure out what all this is for.
Pinch me
Pinch me
'Cause I'm still asleep.
Please God
Tell me
That I'm still asleep

On an evening such as this
It's hard to tell if I exist
If I packed a car and leave this town
Who'll notice that I'm not around?
I could hide out under there
I just made you say 'underwear'
I could leave but I'll just stay
All my stuff's here anyway.

It's like a dream - you try to remember but it's gone,
Then ya try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn,
When ya try to see the world beyond your front door.


 If you're listening? We're trying to get our song on Napster,
But we don't know how to do it...errr...we're Barenaked Ladies
And we're trying to...Ty? Can you just press that over there?

Take your time 'cause the way I rhyme's gonna make you smile,
When ya realise that with a guy my size it might take a while,
Just to try to figure out what all this is for.
Try to figure out what all this is for.
Try to see the world beyond your front door.
Try to figure out what all this is for.
