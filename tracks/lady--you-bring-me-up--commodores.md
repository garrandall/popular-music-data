Lady, you bring me up when I'm down
Maybe you're gonna change my life around

You came to me when I was lonely 
And no one cared
You made me see that I was only 
Just running scared

I saw your face and something told me
You were the one
You smiled at me and now I see
My life's begun

Lady (Pretty lady), you bring me up when I'm down
(Up when I'm down)
Maybe you're gonna change my life around
(Gonna change my life around, yeah)
Lady, you brought me in from out the rain (Yeah)
Maybe my life will never be the same

Once I was filled with desperation
A solitary man
You gave me hope and inspiration
Like only true love can

Now I believe in what you're saying
I'm ten feet tall
This love don't need no explaining
We've got it all

Lady, you bring me up when I'm down (Up when I'm down)
Maybe (Maybe) you're gonna change my life around

Lady, you bring me up when I'm down (Up when I'm down)
Maybe (Yeah) you're gonna change my life around
(You're gonna change my life around)
Lady (Pretty lady), you brought me in from out the rain
Maybe my life will never be the same
(It'll never be the same, yeah)
Lady, you bring me up when I'm down (Up when I'm down)
Maybe (Maybe) you're gonna change my life around
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, lady)

Lady, you bring me up when I'm down
Maybe you're gonna change my life around

Lady...
