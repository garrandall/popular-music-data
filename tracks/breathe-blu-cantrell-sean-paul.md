So what's that supposed to be about baby?
Ya'll free up your mind and stop acting crazy
Reminisce about all the good times daily
Why you try pull that got me acting crazy

What's that supposed to be about baby?
Ya'll free up your mind and stop acting crazy
Sean paul u'll give your the good loving daily
Now you try and pull that got me acting shady



You say you love, say you love me
But you’re never there for me, yeah, mmm...hmm...
You’ll be crying, slowly dying
When I decide to leave, oh, oh

All we do is make up
Then break up
Why don’t we wake up
And see

When love hurts
It won’t work
Maybe we need some time alone
We need to let it breathe

Breathe
Breathe
Breathe



So what's that supposed to be about baby?
Ya'll free up your mind and stop acting crazy
Reminisce about all the good times daily
Why you try pull that got me acting crazy



You’re only lonely when your homie
Ain’t got a ride or no loot, yeah, uh-huh
Then comes the drama
Some other girl is claiming she’s going out with you

Hmm...hmm...

All we do is make up
Then break up
Why don’t we wake up
And see

When love hurts
It won’t work
Maybe we need some time alone
We need to let it breathe

Breathe
Breathe
Breathe
Breathe (Uh...huh...)
Breathe



So what's that supposed to be about baby?
Ya'll free up your mind and stop actin crazy
Shady shady shady shady

Not again
My girl for the fourth time
Let me make it very clear to you
Your very dear to me
And honor of me
Share to you
Me not unfair to you
Who would u want
For real you make me know and
I will be there for you
But me know i'm not a fear to you
Stand up like a man and not be there cuz i care for you
Long time telling you
No other girl can compare to you
Woman if you leave me now
I'm gonna share a lot of tears for you
Say you want to breathe
I'm still not i'm exhaling
Say you want to leave cuz this relationship failing
Ain't nobody say that it would be smooth sailing
Girl i wanna know why your bailing

So what's that supposed to be about baby?
Ya'll free up your mind and stop acting crazy
Reminisce about all the good times daily
Why you try pull that got me acting shady shady baby baby



Maybe we need some time alone
So we can just breathe
Let it breathe
Breathe
Breathe
Let it breathe
Breathe
Breathe
Breathe
Breathe
Yeah yeah yeah yeah let it breathe yeah
Oh oh time to breathe ya'll...
