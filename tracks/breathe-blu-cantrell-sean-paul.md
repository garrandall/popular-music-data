Youâll be cryinâ, slowly dyinâ
When I decide to leave, oh, oh

All we do is make up
Then break up
Why donât we wake up
And see

When love hurts
It wonât work
Maybe we need some time alone
We need to let it breathe

Breathe
Breathe
Breathe



So what's that supposed to be about baby 
Gall free up ya vibe and stop actin crazy 
Reminisce 'pon all the good times daily 
Why you try pull that got me actin shady



Youâre only lonely when your homey
Ainât got a ride or no loot, yeah, uh-huh
Then comes the drama
Some other girl is claiminâ sheâs goinâ out with you,

Hmm... hmm...

All we do is make up
Then break up
Why donât we wake up
And see

It wonât work
Maybe we need some time alone
We need to let it breathe

For real you make me know and
I will be there for you
But me know I'm not a fear to you
Stand up like a man and not be there cuz I care for you
Long time tellin you 
No other girl can compare to you
Woman if you leave me now
I'm gonna shed alot of tears for you
Say you want to breathe

Say you want to leave cuz this relationship failin'
Aint nobody say that it would be smooth sailin'
Girl I wanna know why your bailin'

Why you try pull that got me actin shady shady baby baby

So we can just breathe
Let it breathe
