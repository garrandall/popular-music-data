If you were the ocean and I was the sun
If the day made me heavy and gravity won
If I was the red and you were the blue
I could just fade into you

If you were a window and I was the rain
Iâd pour myself out and wash off the pain
Iâd fall like a tear so your light could shine through
Then Iâd just fade into you

In your heart, in your head,
in your arms, in your bed,
under your skin
Til thereâs no way to know
where you end and where I begin

If I was a shadow and you were a street
The cobblestone midnight is where
we first meet

Til the lights flickered out,
we dance with the moon
Then Iâd just fade into you

In your heart, in your head,
in your arms, in your bed,
under your skin
Til thereâs no way to know
where you end and where I begin

I wanna melt in
I wanna soak through
I only wanna move when you move
I wanna breathe out
when you breathe in then
I wanna fade into you

If I was just ashes
and you were the ground
And under your willow
they laid me down

Thereâll be no trace
that one was once two
After I fade into you

And I just fade into you

And I just fade into you

And I just fade into you

And I just fade into you
