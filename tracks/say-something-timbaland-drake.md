This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely

We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there

But, I'm gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby

Yeah, it really sucks, but ever since I've been long gone
I traded in my senorita for a microphone
I hate the way we fell apart, girl, it's sad to see
Your life was good, but me and you, we a catastrophe

If I was a success, oh, would you be satisfied?
I need a paramedic, girl, I'm feelin' paralyzed
If I could choose, you would always be a friend of me
The more money I made, you actin' like my enemy

It's crazy, I can't help it if you feelin' change
Thought the pressure would turn you to my diamond babe
How could somethin' so familiar be so strange?
Closest friends gettin' strange when your status change

Why is it my mistake that where I am and where you at
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that have my back?
We were the perfect pair, and now it seem that we don't match
Is it the money? Want me to give it back?

This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely

We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there

But, I'm gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby

Uh, I am the topic of conversation, this a celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I moved out my momma's basement
To a condo downtown 'cause it's all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication of life

You shoulda been here to kick it with me
We coulda split this whole thing up 50/50
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever so talented Mr. Ripley

How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit

Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You can tell me that you never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
'Cause what's a star when its most important fan is missing?

This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely

We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there

But, I'm gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
