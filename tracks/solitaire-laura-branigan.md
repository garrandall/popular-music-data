I still remember how much I used to need you
Tried so hard to please you, but you didn't need me
You knew I loved you, knew I always would be there
You just did what you wanted, you didn't care
All the cards were held by you
There was nothin' I could do
All those nights I sat alone, starin' at the telephone
Wonderin' were you ever comin' home

Solitaire, it got so lonely
Solitaire, no one to hold me
Where were you when I played solitaire?

It took some time but I stopped thinkin' about you
Started livin' without you, now look who's back here
You've had a change of heart, well, mine just couldn't wait, no no
You found out you loved me just a little too late

Once the cards were held by you
Now there's nothin' you can do
All those nights you sit alone, starin' at the telephone
Wonderin' if I'm ever comin' home

Solitaire, see what it's like now
Solitaire, to cry all night now
Solitaire, see how it feels to bear

Solitaire, it gets so lonely
Solitaire, you wanna hold me
Don't wait up, 'cos babe, I won't be there
Solitaire, solitaire, solitaire

Solitaire, see what it's like now
Solitaire, to cry all night now
Solitaire, see how it feels to bear

Solitaire, it gets so lonely
Solitaire, you wanna hold me
Don't wait up, 'cos babe, I won't be there
Solitaire (solitaire, solitaire)
