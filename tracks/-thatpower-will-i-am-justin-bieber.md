And oh, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And oh, I can fly, I can fly, I can fly
And oh, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And I'm loving every second, minute, hour, bigger, better, stronger power

I got that power
I got that power
I got that power
Power, power, power

They call me will-A
Stay so cool, I'm chilli
I done made that milli
On my way to that billi
Used to have a piggy bank,
But now I got that bigger bank
Who who cares what the haters say
They hate on me cause we doing what they can't

I stay on that hustle,
I flex that little muscle
Hate to bust your bubble
I'm on that other level

Imma take it higher and high and high and higher
I stay and buy attire
Keeping burning like that fire

And oh, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And oh, I can fly, I can fly, I can fly
And oh, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And I'm loving every second, minute, hour, bigger, better, stronger power

I got that power
I got that power
I got that power
Power, power, power

Yes yes yes y'all feeling funky fresh y'all
Work to be the best y'all
(Work) good under pressure
Been through all that stress y'all
Get, get this off my chest y'all
Made it out in projects with this project that's progress y'all

I did it for my mama
I told her when I was younger
That Imma be that number one,
Yup, I'll be that number one

I take it higher and high and high and higher
I stay and buy attire
Keeping burning like that fire

Whatever doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger
So Imma get stronger
(Comin' like a battle ram, battle ram)
I'm knocking knocking down that door again, door again
(Comin', comin' like a battle ram, battle ram)
I'm knocking knocking down that door again, door again

And oh, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And oh, I can fly, I can fly, I can fly
And oh, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And I'm loving every second, minute, hour, bigger, better, stronger power

I got that power
I got that power
I got that power
Power, power, power

And I'm loving every second, minute, hour, bigger, better, stronger power

And I'm loving every second, minute, hour, bigger, better, stronger power
