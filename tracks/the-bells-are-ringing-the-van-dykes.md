Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse sleigh hey

Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh

Dashing through the snow in a one horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go laughing all the way(ha ha ha)
Bells on bobtail ring making sprits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight

Oh Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh Hey!

Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh

You know I hate the cold
That's why I always go
Down south to drink some rum
On a island in the sun
There's nothing like St. Barts
With the palm trees swaying slow
Or being there on Jost Van Dyke
When the New Year comes and goes

Oh jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh hey

Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
