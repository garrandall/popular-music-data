Ding dong
Ding dong

Oh those bells they are ringing in the tower
They seem to know the hour
When we are together

Oh those bells they say you're mine forever
Let's put our hearts together
To join us as one (ding dong)

Those bells bells are ringing for ours to come around
To join us together so no one can make us part

Oh those bells have put our hearts together
And have joined us forever
Forever and ever to part (ding dong)

Ding dong Bells bells
Ding dong Bells bells bells
