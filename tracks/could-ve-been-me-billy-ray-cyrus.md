I hear you just got married
Took a month-long honeymoon
And you were all smiles at the wedding
You cried when you kissed the groom
I got no invitation
I guess the mailman didn't bring it to me
But I see the whole thing in slow motion
Every night as I try to sleep


My buddy John said you looked real pretty
And you acted like you were in love
He said the preacher asked for objections
And he thought about standing up
I told John he must have been crazy
'Cause you were just about to say I do
He just gave me a wink and said all he could think
Was it could've been me with you


It could've been me standing there with you
It could've been me and my dreams coming true
But those dreams move on if you wait too long
It took me till now to see it could've been me


I don't guess I ever told you
That I went out and bought you a ring
I even carry it around in my pocket
Waiting to say the right thing
I pulled it out the other day
But the diamond had lost its shine
Well, I know how it feels cause my eyes grow dim
When I think you could have been mine


It could've been me standing there with you
It could've been me and my dreams coming true
But those dreams move on if you wait too long
It took me till now to see it could've been me


I know I called just in time a bit too late
You know dreams move on if you wait too long
It took me till now to see that


It could've been me standing there with you
It could've been me and my dreams coming true
But those dreams move on if you wait too long
It took me till now to see it could've been me


(It could've been me) it could've been me
(It could've been me) it could've been me
(It could've been me) it could've been me
