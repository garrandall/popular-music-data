Maybe if I pray every night
You'll come back to me
And maybe if I cried everyday
You'll come back to stay

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, maybe

Maybe if I hold your hand
You will understand
Maybe if I kiss your lips
I'll be at your command

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, maybe

I prayed and prayed to the Lord
To send me back our love
But instead you came to me
Only in my dreams

Maybe if I pray every night
You'll come back to me
Maybe if I cry everyday
You'll come back to stay

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, maybe
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, maybe
