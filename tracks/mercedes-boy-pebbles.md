Do you wanna ride?
Baby
Let me tell you
I've been watching you

See you dancing in my dreams
Feel you heartbeat inside of me
So if you feel it coming on
Catch me getting in the mood

Boy

Cruising's all you have to do

Do you wanna ride in my Mercedes
Boy?
Tell me what you're gonna do with me
'Cause if you wanna ride in my Mercedes
Boy

There are so many things that I'm gonna do to you

Baby

Good looks and more possessing all of me
So when it starts to coming on
Catch me getting in the mood

Boy

Boy?
Tell me what you're gonna do with me
'Cause if you wanna ride in my Mercedes
