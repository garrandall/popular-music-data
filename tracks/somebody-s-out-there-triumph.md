Is it fate or random chance
How can I decide
Are we victims of circumstance
When destinies collide

All the odds are against you
But somehow you make it through
You can rationalize it away
But it all comes down to you

Half our lives we spend waiting
For the knock upon the door
When it comes, will it be the one
That I've been waiting for

Somebody's out there, somewhere
Waiting for someone to come their way
Somebody's out there, somewhere
I will somehow be somebody's someone
Some day

Standing in the shadows
Hiding from the light
Reach out in the darkness
And hold on for your life

All the fear of the future
All the loneliness inside
When the moment of truth arrives, hey
You can run but you can't hide

Somebody's out there, somewhere
Waiting for someone to come their way
Somebody's out there, somewhere
I will somehow be somebody's someone
Some day

I can feel it inside me
I've been holding on so long
Something's telling me something's got to give
'Cause the feeling's way too strong, too strong

Somebody's out there, somewhere
Waiting for someone to come their way
Somebody's out there, somewhere
I will make them mine
Somebody's out there, somewhere
Waiting for someone to come their way
Somebody's out there, somewhere
I will somehow be somebody's someone
Some day (somebody's out there somewhere) 
Some day (somebody's out there somewhere) 
Some day (somebody's out there somewhere) 
I will make them mine (somebody's out there somewhere)
(Somebody's out there somewhere)
