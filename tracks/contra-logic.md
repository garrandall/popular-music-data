Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Bitch, I've been blowin' up (bitch I've been blowin' up)
Everyone showin' up, where was you in the beginnin'?
I know that they're showin' up (know that they're showin' up)
Only come around and fuck with me when the boy winnin'
No, you do not know enough (you do not, you do not, you do not)
You do not know a thing about this life that I'm livin'
You've never been low enough (never been low enough)
Yeah I was born at the bottom, everything I'm given now (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bitch, I've been blowin' up (bitch I've been blowin' up)
Everyone showin' up, where was you in the beginnin'?
I know that they're showin' up (know that they're showin' up)
Only come around and fuck with me when the boy winnin'
No, you do not know enough (you do not, you do not, you do not)
You do not know a thing about this life that I'm livin'
You've never been low enough (never been low enough)
Yeah I was born at the bottom, everything I'm given now (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Bobby, tell me who really 'bout it
Bitch, I got it, not a single person work harder than Bobby
Just wrote a novel, starrin' in a movie
Built another business while you at the party
Ain't one to flex, but yeah I'm finna flex
I just parked that new i8 right next to the Audi
Copped that G-Wagon right there for my shawty
Yeah now they know the name, yeah, they know Bobby

Yeah, get it like, get it like, get it like, get it like me, nah
Handout, palm up, you cannot get this shit here for free, nah
Bobby done put in that work, you gon' pay me a fee, nah

Bitch, I've been blowin' up (bitch I've been blowin' up)
Everyone showin' up, where was you in the beginnin'?
I know that they're showin' up (know that they're showin' up)
Only come around and fuck with me when the boy winnin'

Let that bitch breathe
Most of these people can't never ever comprehend all the shit that I've seen
I am polite than a mothafucka, but when I grip that mic I get mean
Come now, you know what I mean
Pepe done got the boy lean
Yeah you could doubt me, say what you want 'bout me
But I am a rappin' machine
I do this shit for the team
Shit for the squad, I'm livin' the dream
Yes I am livin' the dream, hold up, wait up
Just can't believe
Just can't believe that my swag is on another level
Yeah, I keep it G
Matter of fact, I keep it, I keep it, I keep it, I keep it M
Turn that shit upside down, now it's a W
No, no, ain't nobody fuckin' with him
Don't matter who come stand next to me
Once I'm surrounded ain't nobody fuckin' with them
I am the best of the best of the best
Of the best of the best of the best like Men In Black
Greatest alive, bitch, I've been that
If you don't agree, you'll get kidnapped
Bitch slapped, thrown back like woo

Yeah, get it like, get it like, get it like, get it like me, nah
Handout, palm up, you cannot get this shit here for free, nah
Bobby done put in that work, you gon' pay me a fee, nah
I said Bobby been livin' that life and you know, I said...

Bitch, I've been blowin' up (bitch I've been blowin' up)
Everyone showin' up, where was you in the beginnin'?
I know that they're showin' up (know that they're showin' up)
Only come around and fuck with me when the boy winnin'
No, you do not know enough (you do not, you do not, you do not)
You do not know a thing about this life that I'm livin'
You've never been low enough (never been low enough)
Yeah I was born at the bottom, everything I'm given now (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bitch, I've been blowin' up (bitch I've been blowin' up)
Everyone showin' up, where was you in the beginnin'?
