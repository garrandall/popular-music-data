I still hang around
Neither lost nor found
Hear the lonely sound
Of music in the night
Nights are always bright
That's all that's left for me, yeah
I play the street life because there's no place I can go
Street life, it's the only life I know
Street life and there's a thousand cards to play
Street life, until you play your life away
You let the people see
Just who you wanna be
And every night you sang
Just like a superstar
The type of life that's played
A temptin' masquerade
You dress and walk and talk
You're who you think you are
Street life, you can run away from time
Street life, for a nickel, for a dime
Street life, but you better not get old
Street life, or you're gonna feel the cold
There's always love for sale
A grown up fairy tale
Prince charming always smiles
Behind a silver spoon
And if you keep it young
Your song is always sung
Your love will pay your way
Beneath the silver moon
Street life
Street life
Street life
Oh, street life
I play the street life because there's no place I can go
Street life, it's the only life I know
Street life and there's a thousand cards to play
Street life, until you play your life away
You let the people see
Just who you wanna be
And every night you sang
Just like a superstar
The type of life that's played
A temptin' masquerade
You dress and walk and talk
You're who you think you are
Street life, you can run away from time
Street life, for a nickel, for a dime
Street life, but you better not get old
Street life, or you're gonna feel the cold
There's always love for sale
A grown up fairy tale
Prince charming always smiles
Behind a silver spoon
And if you keep it young
Your song is always sung
Your love will pay your way
Beneath the silver moon
Street life
Street life
Street life
Oh, street life
Oh, street life
Yeah, street life
Street life
Oh, street life
