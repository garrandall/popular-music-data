Friends they call me
On the phone
'Cause I'm steady
Talk about unhappy homes
'Cause I'm steady
Though I don't like to let it show
I got troubles of my own

We push and pull
And we fall apart
I'm not gonna die
Of a broken heart
I just don't want to
Stop and start
'Cause I'm steady

Day to day is so unsure
But I'm steady
I watch people crash and soar
But I'm steady
The more they try
So hard to change
The more they stay the same

We push and pull
And we fall apart
I'm not gonna die
Of a broken heart
I just don't want to
Stop and start
'Cause I'm steady

We're faced with so much
Back and forth
I don't need no ups and downs

We push and pull
And we fall apart
I'm not gonna die
Of a broken heart
I just don't want to
Stop and start
'Cause I'm steady
I'm steady
I'm steady
