They said your cheating heart will make me cry
And like a fool I gave it a try
I shoulda listened when they told me so
Many many tears ago

But I could not believe the things they said
Because my heart overruled my head
I shoulda listened when they told me so
Many many tears ago

I laughed out loud when they told me
That you had someone else
But your cheating heart has shown me
That I was only fooling myself

Well it's too late for a brand new start
For I have cried you out of my heart
I shoulda listened when they told me so
Many many tears ago

I laughed out loud when they told me
That you had someone else
But your cheating heart has shown me
That I was only fooling myself

Well it's too late for a brand new start
For I have cried you out of my heart
I shoulda listened when they told me so
I shoulda listened when they told me so
I shoulda listened when they told me so
Many many tears ago
