Something deep inside of me
Keeps me moving aimlessly
Always been, I'll always be
A lonely travelin' man
Something that I can't explain
Holding me from wind and rain
Wild and free and hard to tame
A lonely travelin' man


Travelin' Man
Travelin' Man
Got no goal got no plan
Just an old worn out heart in my hand
Travelin' Man
Travelin' Man
I'll get there anyway I can
I'm just an uninspiring tired out travelin' man


Please don't ask me where I've been
I've been alone through thick and thin
On the outside looking in
A lonely travelin' man
Something that I haven't found
Keeps me seeking all around
Moving on from town to town
A lonely travelin' man


Travelin' Man
Travelin' Man
Got no goal got no plan
Just an old worn out heart in my hand
Travelin' Man
Travelin' Man
I'll get there anyway I can
I'm just an uninspiring tired out travelin' man
Travelin' Man
Travelin' Man
Got no goal got no plan
Just an old worn out heart in my hand
Travelin' Man
Travelin' Man
I'll get there anyway I can
I'm just an uninspiring tired out..
