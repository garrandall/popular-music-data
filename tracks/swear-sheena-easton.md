I won't bother asking what you've done
Though the rumors all point to something going on
See the past is the past, I'm not gonna dwell
But I better never catch you with someone else

So Ill put it to you once, but never again (swear)
If you wanna be a lover, if you wanna be a friend (swear)
Then take five fingers, and put it to your heart (swear)

S.W.E.A.R.

Hand over heart and swear that you love me, swear that you need me

Get a judge and jury, bible in your hand
Gotta tell the whole truth, nothing less than that, boy

(Swear) That you love me! (Swear) That you need me
(Swear) That you want me! (Swear) Tell the truth!
Hand over heart and swear that you love me, swear that you need me

Swear!

(Swear) That you love me! (Swear) That you need me
(Swear) That you want me! (Swear) Tell the truth!
Hand over heart and swear that you love me, swear that you want me

I won't bother asking what you've done
Though the rumors all point to something going on
See the past is the past, I'm not gonna dwell
But I better never catch you with someone else

So Ill put it to you once, but never again
If you wanna be a lover, if you wanna be a friend
Then take five fingers, and put it to your heart

S.W.E.A.R. (don't lie)

(Swear) Do I need a judge and jury, (swear) with a Bible in your hand
(Swear) To make you tell the whole truth, (swear) nothing less than that

(Swear) Should I strap a lie detector
(Swear) To your heart, to your heart, to your heart
(Swear) Can I make you tell the whole truth
(Swear) Cross your heart, cross your heart, cross your heart
(Swear) That you want me, (swear) that you need me, (swear) that you love me
(Swear) Tell the truth, tell the truth, don't lie!
