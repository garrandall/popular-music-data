It's five O'clock, just got paid
I'll be off the next two days
No more workin' like dogs
No more leash, no more boss

I got a weekend full of nothin' to do at all
Yee haw!

I know a place down the road
The girls are hot, the beer is cold
It's two-for-one, yeah, that's right
Not just drinks, it's girls to guys

I hear the twins are back in town from Saginaw
Yee haw!

You take your all-right, you take your can't-wait
A lotta of bring-it-on and some damn straight
And mix it all up with some down home southern drawl, y'all
You got your yee haw!

The place is packed, the line is long
The band knows every Haggard song
I'm gettin' loose, I've had a few
She wants to dance, I do too

But her boyfriend's mad, I, I think he wants to brawl
All right, yee haw!

You take your all-right, you take your can't-wait
A lotta of bring-it-on and some damn straight
And mix it all up with some down home southern drawl, y'all
You got your yee haw!

I'm talkin' big time, I mean saddle up ad hold on tight
And if you know what I'm talkin' about, y'all, yeah
How about a yee haw! Ha, ha
Yep, bow bow, Y E E H A W, yee haw!
