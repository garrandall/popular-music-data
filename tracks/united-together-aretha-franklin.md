We've had a hard time
You and I
Life sent us through some changes
Oh, but somehow we got by

A winding road, a heavy load
Is nothing new, you see
We know that through the bad times
I'll have you and you'll have me

United together
I finally found the one
Who'll love me forever
We two have just become as one

If we just keep this love alive
As time goes on this joy we know
Can't help but grow inside

Some people spend a lifetime
Looking for that special need
I'm so glad my search is over
Darling, I'm so glad that we're

United together (United together)
I finally found the one (I finally found the one)
Who'll love me forever (Who'll love me forever)
We two have just become (We two have just become as one)

There's nothing we can't overcome
If you let me be your only one
There's nothing we can't overcome (Oh, hoo, hoo)
If you let me be your one and only, one and only

Some people spend a lifetime
Looking for that special need
I'm so glad my search is over
Darling, I'm so glad that we're

United together (United together)
I finally found the one (I have finally found the one)
Who'll love me forever (Who will love me and stand by me forever)
We two have just become

United together (United together)
I finally found the one (I finally found the one)
Who'll love me forever (Who will love me and stand by me forever)
We two have just become (Oh, yes, we have)
We two have just become (Oh, yes, we have)

United together (United together)
I finally found the one (I finally found the one)
Who'll love me forever (Who will love me, love me, love me)
We two have just become (We are, we are, we are)

United together (United together)
I finally found the one (Finally found the one)
Who'll love me forever (Who will love me forever)
We two have just become (Oh, we two)

United together (United together)
I finally found the one (I finally found the one)
Who'll love me forever (Who will love me forever)
We two have just become (We two have just become)

United together (United together)
I finally found the one (I finally found the one)
Who'll love me forever (Oh, who will love me forever)
We two have just become
