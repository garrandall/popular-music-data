I can tell by their talk
Like they don't understand
Why we kiss as we talk
And you cling to my hand

Can it be they forgot
That these things mean a lot
We're young, young and in love
(Young and in love)

Now they just don't believe
That our feeling is deep
They say we shouldn't rush
If it's love, it will keep

But the thrill is so great
Why should we have to wait
We're young, young and in love
(Young and in love)

Oh, they whisper that
We're at a dangerous age
Too reckless, too wild
And too fast

Oh, but I bet that they
Went through a similar stage
And did the same things
In the past

So, my darling, although
We are still in our teens
Oh, we know, yes, we know
What true love really means

Don't let time slip away
Make the most of today
We're young, young and in love
(Young and in love)

Oh, we're young and in love
Young and in love
(Young and in love)

Oh, we're young and in love
Young and in love
(Young and in love)
