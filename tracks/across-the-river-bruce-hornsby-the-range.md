Well, she moved back around here
Thirty-five weeks ago today
Oh, down the lane

Well, at night she walks on the banks
And remembers how she dreamed of rowing away
And how she left one day

She left with a driven look in her eyes
Came back around with it still inside
They said give it some time
And you'll forget about it too
We know they always do

Well, I know some fine day
You will find your way
Across the river, across the river
Row down slow
There's a long way to go
Across the river, across the river

She was proud and so strong
But she tried not to listen to idle talk
Downtown where she walked

Well, they sit around and they say
That she came back with her tail between her legs
Like they always said she would

Well, I hear it's better on the other side
They say you'll never do it so don't even try
Well, you may be beaten down with your closed mind
But don't try to make it mine

Well, I know some fine day
You will find your way
Across the river, across the river
Row down slow
There's a long way to go
Across the river, across the river

"Your wild days are through"
Is what they said
I dreamed she came, and I went down
And I walked where she led

Standing on the shore
She looks to the west with a look of longing
To where the grass seems greener
Well, there's a hard and distant prize
It probably won't happen but I think I'll try
Well, even if it doesn't happen for me
It still beats hanging around here

Well, I know some fine day
You will find your way
Across the river, across the river
Row down slow
There's a long, long way to go
Across the river, across the river
