Good job First


Got your ho with me
I pull her slowly
Saint Laurent on both my feet
All this jewelry, they gon' notice me
And you know I got that Rol' on me
I put it slow on me
Saint Laurent on both my feet
All this jewelry, they gon' notice me


Hulla
I wanna ride, ride, ride on it
Keep my eyes, eyes, eyes on her
Wanna grind, grind, grind on her
I wanna fly, fly, fly on it
Cannot vibe, vibe, vibe on it
Find five, five, five on it
Get live, yeah


All this jewelry, they gon' notice me (ayy)
Birds in the traps singin' like Jodeci
I tip a bitch just 'cause of my courtesy (tippin')
Been through her show, pick up my currency (back it)
Versace slippers colored burgundy ('Sace!)
Rappers be talkin', think they hurtin' me (uh uh)
I took his ho, make her come work for me (bitch!)
Keep the Draco case in emergency (grr, grat)
Ridin' 'round the city
Sippin' a tea, packin' the heat, niggas that lookin' for me (lookin' for)
Comin' up watchin' them niggas on TV like they were what I wanted to be (wanted to)
Now they wanna get paid for it, they got us a blessing to see (naw, for real)
Don't charge 'em on stage for it, Saint Laurent on my feet


Got your ho with me
I pull her slowly
Saint Laurent on both my feet
All this jewelry, they gon' notice me
And you know I got that Rol' on me
I put it slow on me
Saint Laurent on both my feet
All this jewelry, they gon' notice me


Hulla
I wanna ride, ride, ride on it
Keep my eyes, eyes, eyes on her
Wanna grind, grind, grind on her
I wanna fly, fly, fly on it
Cannot vibe, vibe, vibe on it
Find five, five, five on it
Get live, yeah


I told that bitch to drop a four for me (drop a four)
Drop my top, now I'm exposing me (skrt, skrt)
A lot of these rappers getting old to me (they kinda old)
Extortion publishing, you owe it to me (you know you owe)
I'm droppin' the top and showin' the titties (drop top)
Bunch of the money, we tryna get fitted (went to the mind)
I clear my mind and I had a vision (I had a vision)
And then I arrive with twenty-five bitches (then they arrive)
We sell out the whole facility
Not likin' your vibe, your energy (vibe)
I came from the pot with Kimberly (pot)
She sniffin' the lines, assembly (lines)
We had a good time in Italy (time)
Yo, these niggas be lyin' about loyalty (lyin')
Get on my knees, prayin' to God to cover me


Got your ho with me
I pull her slowly
Saint Laurent on both my feet
All this jewelry, they gon' notice me
And you know I got that Rol' on me
I put it slow on me
Saint Laurent on both my feet
All this jewelry, they gon' notice me


Hulla
I wanna ride, ride, ride on it
Keep my eyes, eyes, eyes on her
Wanna grind, grind, grind on her
I wanna fly, fly, fly on it
Cannot vibe, vibe, vibe on it
Find five, five, five on it
Get live, yeah

Nawfside, yeah
Can we ride, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
