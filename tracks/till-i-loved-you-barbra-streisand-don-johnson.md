Nothing lived, nothing grew
Till I loved you
Every sky ever gray, never blue
You were my friend, good friend
And sometimes I would wonder
Could the one to save me
Possibly be you?
I was lost, I was blind
Till I loved you
Wouldn't see, couldn't find someone new
You were my friend, dear friend
I held you close to my heart
But I never thought that I'd feel the way I do
Until that certain moment when I loved you
And now I can't ever imagine
My living without you
It seems I spend all of my time
Thinking only about you
Once I dreamed in a dream I would find you
Never thought that the dream would come true
Until that curtain lifted, parted, drifted from you
Until that certain moment when I loved you
Until that certain moment
Certain moment when I loved you
When I loved you
Nothing lived, nothing grew
Till I loved you
Every sky ever gray, never blue
Empty days, empty nights
Sometimes I wonder
Could the one to save me possibly be you?
Oh I was lost, I was blind till I found you
Couldn't see, couldn't find someone new
You came along, stole my heart completely
And I thought, could the one to save me possibly be you?
