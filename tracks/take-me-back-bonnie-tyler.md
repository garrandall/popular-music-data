You said it's over now
It's just not right
You said there's a better place for you to be
It's not with me
Then you turned and walked away
I can't believe what I see
And I can't go to sleep at night when I think of how it used to be

She can't give you what I've got
And she can't stop your pain
And she can't love you the way I do
God I want you back again
Maybe she could try with money
Or she could buy you clothes
But baby when it's dark and you're home at night
Does she ever hold you close

She takes you out in style
She treats you right
She gives you all the things I never could, she's so good
But don't you think of me
Baby late at night
And I just can't take it boy, together we could be so right

She can't give you what I've got
And she can't stop your pain
And she can't love you the way I do
God I want you back again
Maybe she could try with money
Or she could buy you clothes
But baby when it's dark and you're home at night
Does she ever hold you close

Take me back
(Ohyou're gonna need me)
(Ohyou're gonna need me)
Take me back
(Ohyou're gonna need me)
All those things we did before
Whatever happened to them
And all those things I've been living for
Gotta start 'em all over again

You said it couldn't last
That we were meant to part
A guy like you and a girl like me didn't stand a chance - not from the start
But then you looked at me
I had to ask you why
As I see and try to find out why you left me for those hungry eyes

She can't give you what I've got
And she can't stop your pain
And she can't love you the way I do
God I want you back again
Maybe she could try with money
Or she could buy you clothes
But baby when it's dark and you're home at night
Does she ever hold you close

Take me back
Ohyou're gonna take me
Take me back
Ohyou're gonna take me
Take me back
Ohyou're gonna take me
Take me back...
