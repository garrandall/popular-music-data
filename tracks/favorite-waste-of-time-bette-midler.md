You're my-i-i-i-i-i, baby, you're my favorite waste of time.
My-i-i-i-i-i, baby, you're my favorite waste of time.

Here I am, I'm playing daydreaming fool again.
My favorite game.
And you are the one who's got my head in the clouds above.
You're the one that I love and
you're my-i-i-i-i-i, baby, you're my favorite waste of time.
My-i-i-i-i-i, baby, you're my favorite waste of time.

I don't care if being with you
is meaningless and ridiculous;
If it's wrong or right.
I'm gonna give you my love tonight
and tomorrow night 'cause
you're my-i-i-i-i-i, baby, you're my favorite waste of time.
My-i-i-i-i-i, baby, you're my favorite wast of time.

Oh, oh oohyeah.
You're my-i-i-i-i-i-i-i, baby, you're my favorite waste of time.
My-i-i-i-i-i-i-i, baby, you're my favorite waste of time.

And one last thing:
I'm gonna give you my love tonight,
and the bells gonna ring 'cause
you're my-i-i-i-i-i-i-i, baby, you're my favorite waste of time.
My-i-i-i-i-i, baby. you're my favorite waste of time.
My-i-i-i-i-i, baby, you're my favorite waste of time.
My-i-i-i-i-i, baby, you're my favorite waste of time.
