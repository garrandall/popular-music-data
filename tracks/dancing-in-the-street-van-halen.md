Wow! 
Ah yeah! 
Calling out around the world,are you ready for a brand new beat. 
Summer's here and the time is right,for dancing in the streets, 
They're dancing in Chicago (They'll be dancing) 
Down in New Oreleans (Dancing in the streets) 
Up in New york city (Dancing in the streets) 
All we need is music (sweet sweet) sweet music (sweet sweet music) 
There'll be music everywhere. 
There'll be swinging,swaying,records playing,dancing in the streets,Oh! 
It doesnt matter what hat you wear,just as long as you are there, 
So come on 
Grab a guy,grab a girl,everywhere around the world. 
There'll be dancing,dancing in the streets. 
(Oh)Its just an invitation,across the nation,a chance for folks to meet. 
There'll be laughing and singing,music swinging,dancing in the streets 
All we need is music (sweet sweet) sweet music (sweet sweet music) 
There'll be music everywhere. 
There'll be swinging,swaying,records playing,dancing in the streets,Oh! 
It doesnt matter what hat you wear,just as long as you are there, 
So come on 
Grab a guy,grab a girl,everywhere around the world. 
Dancing,dancing in the streets, 
Way down in LA,everyday,dancing in the streets (Dancing in the streets) 
San Francisco way, (Dancing in the streets), they do it everyday now, 
(Dancing in the streets)
