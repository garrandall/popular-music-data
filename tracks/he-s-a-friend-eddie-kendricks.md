He's a friend of mine
He's a friend of mine

There was a time, I didn't believe at all
Then one day, I had to give him a call
There I was lying flat on my back
The doctor said, I had a heart attack
I said a prayer, before I went to sleep
Next day you'll know, I was back up on my feet

Oh
He's a friend of mine (He's a friend of mine)
He's a friend of mine (I want everybody to know it)
He's a friend of mine (Yeah, He is)
He's a friend of mine (He is a friend of mine)

I don't say much, but I speak to Him every day
He's always there, to help me find my way
I don't deny, our close association
He helps me out, of any situation
If you read the book, of Revelations
You'll find that He's, your only salvation

Oh
He's a friend of mine (Yeah)
He's a friend of mine (I want everybody to know)
He's a friend of mine (He is a friend of mine)
He's a friend of mine (Oh, He is a friend of mine)

I don't deny, our close association
He helps me out, of any situation
If you read the book, of Revelations
You'll find that He's, your only salvation

He's a friend of mine (He's a friend of mine)
He's a friend of mine (I want everybody to know)
He's a friend of mine (He is a friend of mine)
He's a friend of mine (A friend)
Log on to kill this message
He's a friend of mine (Oh)
He's a friend of mine (Everybody's friend)
He's a friend of mine (Everyday, in every way)
He's a friend of mine (Every way, a friend of mine)
He's a friend of mine (He is a friend of mine)

He's in my heart
He is
He's in my mind
All the time
He's all I need

He's a friend of mine (Don't you need a friend)
He's a friend of mine
He's a friend of mine (Don't you need a friend)

He's a friend of mine (Don't you need a friend)
He's a friend of mine
He's a friend of mine (Don't you need a friend)
