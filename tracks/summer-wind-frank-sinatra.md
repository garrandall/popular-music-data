The summer wind, came blowin' in from across the sea
It lingered there, to touch your hair and walk with me
All summer long, we sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts, and the summer wind

Like painted kites, those days and nights they went flyin' by
The world was new, beneath a blue umbrella sky
Then softer than, a piper man, one day it called to you
I lost you, I lost you to the summer wind

The autumn wind, and the winter winds
They have come and gone
And still the days, those lonely days they go on and on
And guess who sighs his lullabies
Through nights that never end
My fickle friend, the summer wind
The summer wind, warm summer wind, the summer wind
