The summer wind came blowin' in from across the sea
It lingered there to touch your hair and walk with me
All summer long we sang a song and then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts and that summer wind

Like painted kites, those days and nights, they went flyin' by
The world was new beneath a blue umbrella sky
Then softer than a piper man, one day it called to you
Well I lost you, I lost you to that summer wind

Now the autumn wind and the winter winds, they have come and gone
Still the days, the lonely days go on and on
And guess who sighs his lullabies through nights that never end?
My fickle friend, that summer wind
Oh the summer wind
The warm, warm summer wind
