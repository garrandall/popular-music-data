I put away your photograph
And turn out all the lights
But I can't seem to make myself forget
'Cause every time I close my eyes
And see your face again
I realize that's all that I have left

I'm through with love
I'm through with pain
Don't wanna feel that way again
'Cause if you're gone for good
I'll never be the same

I thought that what we had was real
But maybe I'm a fool
Who only sees the things he wants to see
'Cause it seems that when I need you most
I find myself alone
And I know that's not the way love's supposed to be

I'm through with love
And sad goodbyes
Can't take the lows
Don't want those highs
This heart needs time to mend
I'm through with love, my friend

Well, maybe someday if the feeling comes again
I won't remember how it hurt but until then

I'm through with love
I'm through with pain
Don't wanna feel that way again
'Cause if you're gone for good
I'll never be the same

I'm through with love
And sad goodbyes
Can't take the lows
Don't want those highs
This heart needs time to mend
'Cause if we've reached the end
Till I can feel again
I'm through with love, my friend
