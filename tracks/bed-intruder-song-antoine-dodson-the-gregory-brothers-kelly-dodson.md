He's climbin in your windows
He's snatchin your people up
Tryna rape em so y'all need to
Hide your kids, hide your wife
Hide your kids, hide your wife
Hide your kids, hide your wife
And hide your husband cuz they're rapin everybody out here
You don't have to come and confess
We're lookin for you
We gon find you we gon find you
So you can run and tell that,
Run and tell that
Run and tell that, homeboy
Home, home, homeboy



We got your t-shirt
You done left fingerprints and all
You are so dumb
You are really dumb--for real
You are really, really, really, really so dumb
The man got away leaving behind evidence

I was attacked by some idiot in the projects

So dumb, so dumb, so dumb, so




Bout 5'9", 5'10", Coffee complexion
Low cut like a Caesar with some little waves in his head
Clean cut, very smooth face
Seein my sister when I walked in
He had his hands around her neck
First thing was to pull him off of her
And that's what I did

Well, obviously we have a rapist in Lincoln Park

Are you serious, my boy?
I got your t-shirt
I got your scent
I know what shoe size you wear, my boy
So you can run and hide
But we're gonna find you, find you
