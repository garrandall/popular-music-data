Take my hand in yours
Press my lips to yours
Let my eyes gaze into yours
My darling, I love you
All I love is yours
All I have is yours
I would give my very life for yours
My darling, I love you
You are all that I live for
You are all that I care for
You alone hold my fate now
Please be kind to my heart
Here, take these arms, they're yours
Here, take these lips, they're yours
Here, have a promise, forever yours
My darling, I love you
