If you need me, I wantcha to call me
Said if you need me, all ya gotta do is call me
Don't wait too lo-o-ong if things go wrong
I-I-I'll be home, whoa-oh-oh, home

If you want me, send for me
I said if you want me, want, all ya gotta do is send for me
Don't wait too lo-o-ong, just-a pick up your phone
And I-I-I'll (hurry home where I belong)


People always said, darlin', that I didn't mean you no good.
And you would need me someday.
Way deep down in my heart I know I've done the best I could.
That's why I know that one of these days, it won't be long, 
you'll come walkin' through that same door (I'll hurry home).
And I can imagine in my mind that these are the words that you'll be sayin'.

I still love you, always thinkin' of you
And I still love, love, always thinkin' of you
Don't wait too lo-o-ong, just-a pick up your phone
And I-I-I'll hurry home (I'll hurry home)
Right there, where I belong
