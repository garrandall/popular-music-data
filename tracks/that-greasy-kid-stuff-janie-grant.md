Cleopatra sailing down the Nile with Mark
Was huggin' and kissin' was as happy as a lark
But suddenly she ran her fingers through his hair
Stopped and said Well I declare
Are you still using that greasy kid stuff?
That icky sticky ooey gooey greasy kid stuff
Stanley looked for Livingston the books all say
Found him in the jungle on that famous day
Shook his hand and shouted in a voice that boomed
Dr. Livingston I presume...
That you're still using that greasy kid stuff
That icky sticky ooey gooey greasy kid stuff
Delilah was a gal who was as smart as a fox
She crew-cut Sampson's curly locks
She wiped off the scissors when the job was done
Then whispered softly Tell me hon
Are you still using that greasy kid stuff?
That icky sticky ooey gooey greasy kid stuff
I dreamt that I was at a summit meeting last night
Nikita and the president were setting things right
Everything was fine until Nikita says
If it's not top secret, tell me prez
Are you still using that greasy kid stuff?
That icky sticky ooey gooey greasy kid stuff...
