Ooooooooh
When I met you baby
You put a circle of love around me

Ooooooooh
When I met you baby
You put a circle of love around me

And I give you my heart
I was in love right from the start
(Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii)

Got my first kiss in the back seat of a car
I was hot, I was really rarin' to go
Got my first kiss in the back seat of a car
At the drive-in, the drive-in movie show

And I gave her my heart
I was in love right from the start
(Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii)

Ooooooooh
When I met you baby
You put a circle of love around me

Ooooooooh
When I met you baby
You put a circle of love around me

And I give you my heart
I was in love right from the start
(Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii)
