Rachel:
I'm limited
Just look at me
I'm limited
And just look at you
You can do all I couldn't do, Glinda

So now it's up to you
For both of us
Now it's up to you

Kurt:
I've heard it said that people come into our lives for a reason
Bringing something we must learn
And we are led to those who help us most to grow
If we let them, and we help them in return
Well, I don't know if I believe that's true
But I know I'm who I am today because I knew you

Like a comet pulled from orbit as it passes a sun
Like a stream that meets a boulder halfway through the wood
Who can say if I've been changed for the better?
Because I knew you
I have been changed for good

Rachel:
It well may be that we will never meet again in this lifetime
So let me say before we part
So much of me is made from what I learned from you
You'll be with me like a handprint on my heart
And now whatever way our stories end
I know you have rewritten mine by being my friend

Like a ship blown from its mooring by a wind off the sea
Like a seed dropped by a skybird in a distant wood
Who can say if I've been changed for the better
But because I knew you

Kurt:
Because I knew you

Kurt and Rachel:
I have been changed for good

Rachel:
And just to clear the air
I ask forgiveness for the things I've done you blame me for

Kurt:
But then I guess we know there's blame to share

Kurt and Rachel:
And none of it seems to matter anymore

Kurt (Rachel):
Like a comet pulled from orbit (Like a ship blown from its mooring)
As it passes a sun (By a wind off the sea)
Like a stream that meets a boulder (Like a seed dropped by a bird)
Halfway through the wood (In the wood)

Kurt and Rachel:
Who can say if I've been changed for the better?
I do believe I have been changed for the better

Kurt:
And because I knew you

Rachel:
Because I knew you

Kurt and Rachel:
Because I knew you
I have been changed for good
