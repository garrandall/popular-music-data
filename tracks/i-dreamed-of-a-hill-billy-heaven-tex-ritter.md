(Wah, wah, wah, waaahhhh)
I dreamed I was there in hillbilly heaven


Spoken:
Last night I dreamed I went to hillbilly heaven. And you know who greeted me at the gate? The ole
Cowboy-philosopher himself, Will Rogers. He said to me, he said "Tex, the Big Boss of the riders
Up here has asked me to kinda show you around. Now, over yonder are a couple of your ole compadres."
My, was I glad to see them, Carson Robison and the Mississippi blue yodeler Jimmie Rodgers

I dreamed I was there in hillbilly heaven


Spoken:
He introduced me to Wiley Post, and he showed me the Hall of Fame with all the gold guitars and fiddles
Hanging on the walls. Then he said, "Tex, step over this way, there are two more of your friends I know
You'll want to see, they're waitin' for you." There they were standin' side by side and smilin' at me--
Hank Williams and Johnny Horton

I met all the stars in hillbilly heaven


Spoken:
Then I asked him who else do you expect in the next, uh, say a hundred years? He handed me a large book
Covered with star dust. Will called it the Big Tally Book. In it were many names and each name was branded
In pure gold. I began to read some of them as I turned the pages: Red Foley, Ernest Tubb, Gene Autry
Roy Acuff, Eddy Arnold, Tennessee Ernie, Jimmy Dean, Andy Griffith, Roy Rogers, Tex Ritter (Whaaaatttt???)
Tex Ritter? Oh, well, that's when I woke up, and I'm sorry I did, because

I dreamed I was there in hillbilly heaven
