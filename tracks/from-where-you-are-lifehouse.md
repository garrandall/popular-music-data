So far away from where you are
These miles have torn us worlds apart
And I miss you
Yeah, I miss you
So far away from where you are
I'm standing underneath the stars
And I wish you (And I wish you) were here


I miss the years that were erased (That were erased)
I miss the way the sunshine would light up your face
I miss all the little things (Little things)
I never thought that they'd mean everything to me
Yeah, I miss you (Yeah, I miss you)
And I wish you, were here


I feel the beating of your heart
I see the shadows of your face
Just know that wherever you are
Yeah, I miss you (Yeah, I miss you)
And I wish you (And I wish you) were here


I miss the years that were erased (That were erased)
I miss the way the sunshine would light up your face
I miss all the little things (All the little things)
I never thought that they'd mean everything to me
Yeah, I miss you (Yeah, I miss you)
And I wish you, were here


So far away from where you are
These miles have torn us worlds apart
And I miss you (And I miss you)
Yeah, I miss you (Yeah, I miss you)
And I wish you (And I wish you) were here
