Your kiss, your kiss, your kiss
Means more to me than anything I've ever known before
Your love, your love, your love
Is the only love I've ever known that keeps me wanting so much more
I thought there was nothing I had missed
And I thought I knew the meaning of a lover's kiss
You've turned me inside out
You've taught me what love was about
And that's why I'll always love you


Your touch, your touch, your touch
Is that velvet touch that thrills me so
How much you'll never know
When we're alone, when we're alone, when we're alone
Sometimes things that are wrong seem oh so right
Darling, please hold me tight
You've turned me inside out
You've taught me what love was about
And for this I'll always love you
