What's the sense in sharing this one and only life
Ending up just another lost and lonely wife
You'll count up the years, and they will be filled with tears

Love only breaks up to start over again
You'll get the baby, but you won't have your man
While he's busy loving every woman that he can, uh-huh

Say I'm gonna leave a hundred times a day
It's easier said than done when you just can't break away
(When you just can't break away)

Oh, young hearts run free
They'll never be hung up, hung up like my man and me
My man and me

Ooh, young hearts, to yourself be true
Don't be no fool when love really don't love you
Don't love you

It's high time now, just one crack at life
Who wants to live it in trouble and strife
My mind must be free to learn all I can about me, mm

I'm gonna love me for the rest of my days
Encourage the babies every time they say
âSelf-preservation is what's really going on todayâ

I say I'm gonna turn loose a thousand times a day
But how can I turn loose when I just can't break away
(When I just can't break away)

Oh, young hearts just run free
They'll never be hung up, hung up like my man and me
You and me

Ooh, young hearts, to yourself be true
Don't be no fool when love really don't love you
Don't love you

Oh, young hearts run free
They'll never be hung up, hung up like my man and me
My man and me

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, young hearts, to yourself be true
Don't be no fool when love really don't love you
It don't love you

Ooh, young hearts run free
They'll never be hung up, hung up like my man and me
My man and me

Oh, young hearts, to yourself be true
Don't be no fool when love really don't love you
Don't love you

Ooh, young hearts run free
They'll never be hung up, hung up like my man and me
