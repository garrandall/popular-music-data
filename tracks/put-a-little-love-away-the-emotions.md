We ask a question
You have no answer
The music finds you
A sad and lonely dancer

Somehow you lost it
What everybody's looking for
But yesterday's dead and gone
Tomorrow then you'll know

Better

Put a little love away
Everybody needs a
Penny for a rainy day
Put a little love away
Keep another thought in mind
Someone's gotta leave
Somebody's gotta stay behind
Put a little love away

Two people sharing
One tear too many
Look around for miracles

You know you don't find many

I've seen it coming
But what am I supposed to do
Just take a closer look around
Simply say to you

Better
