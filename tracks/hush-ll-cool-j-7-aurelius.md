Hush baby, wanna let ya know
This is how its gonna go




Hush baby, wanna let ya know
This is how its gonna go
If u wanna come and play
Gotta do it my way
Hush baby, don't talk so much
Just wanna feel ya touch
Everything will be ok
If u do it my way (my way, my way)
Hush baby


U feel so good
Rest of my life I wish I could
Hold u tight and take a flight out the hood
Was I foul or just misunderstood?
Mind-mannered or up to no-good
It really doesnt matter, either way I should
Maximize the moment and hold ya close
Jump in the drop spider and cruise down the coast
Who loved u the most?
I was never ghost
When lives was on the line
Confusion in ya mind
Runnin outta time
Drama of all kind
But theres faith in our mind
We spiritually inclined
Sometimes I flip
Sometimes u flip
Sometimes we wild out and act like lunatics
We movin too fast, the whole world's in a rush
Everybody just hush...

Its all a test; the pain, the drama
The villa in the bahamas
The highs, the lows
The hoop-t, the Rolls
The money flowin
Certain doors that we go in
The people we meet, the hands that we shake
Whether its Mortans or Sizzla steak
But everything will be okay
 if we do it my way
Cuz I believe in romance
Kissin while ya slow dance
Me bouncin baby? no chance
No matter the circumstance
Whatever it takes gurl, ill swim to France
Cuz ya beauty's unmatched
Such a great catch
Unconditional love, forever we are attatched
Deal with the drama, we can find our way back
With or without the Maybach...

I can feel ya pain
Like we simese twins connected by our brains
Walkin thru the desert in the ice cold rain
Want u in my life and nothins gonna change
God willin, we still be doin our thang
When my six-pack's faded
Raps outdated
But thats many years from now so don't rush
Little mama just hush...

Hush baby
Hush hush darling
Hush baby hush hush
Dont talk so much
Wanna feel ya touch


Hush baby hush
Hush baby hush


Hush baby wanna let ya know
