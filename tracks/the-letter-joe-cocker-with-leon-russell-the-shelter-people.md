Give me a ticket for an aeroplane

Give me a ticket for an aeroplane
I ain't got time to take no fast train
Oh the lonely days are gone I'm coming home
My baby she wrote me a letter

I don't care how much I've got to spend
Oh I'm gonna find my way back home again
Oh my lonely days are gone I'm coming home
Yeah my baby, she wrote me a letter

She wrote me a letter
Said, "She couldn't live without no more"
Listen to me Mister 
My baby once more, anyway

I don't care how much I've got to spend
I'm gonna find my way, way back home again
Lonely days are gone I'm coming home
My baby, she wrote me a letter

Well she wrote me a letter
Said, "She can't live without me no more"
Listen to me Mister 
My baby once more, anyway

Give me a ticket for an aeroplane
I ain't got time, take no fast train
Oh the lonely days are gone I'm coming home
My baby she wrote me a letter

My baby wrote me a letter
My baby wrote me a letter
My baby wrote me a letter
...
