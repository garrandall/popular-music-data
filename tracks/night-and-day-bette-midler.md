Ohhhhhhh.
Maybe you and I see life with two different visions,
and neither one of us is wrong or right.
And maybe we're too serious and don't wanna listen.
I just wanna make you laugh tonight.

We're like day and night, night and day.
We are both so different in so many ways.
We're like night and day, day and night,
and we go together just like black and white.

Seems you're always out one door when I'm in the other.
It's so hard to find some quiet time.
(So hard to find the time)
Wish that we could spend our lives alone with each other,
and never think about the world outside.

We're like day and night, night and day.
We are oh, so different in so many ways.
We're like night and day, day and night.
Still we know it's gonna be all right.

And if we never really get the picture right,
how many of us ever really win the fight?
I never want to lose your love,
or let the distance get the best of us,
'cause time is moving fast enough!

Maybe we don't always share a common opinion.
It's true that you and I don't think alike.
But when I look into your eyes and all is forgiven,
(all is forgiven)
all I wanna do is hold you tight.

We're like day and night, night and day.
We are both so different in so many ways.
We're like night and day, day and night.
Still we know it's gonna be all right.
We're like night and day, day and night.
We go together just like black and white.

We're like, we're like, we're like, we're like
day and night, night and day,
day and night, night and day.
We're like, we're like, we're like
day and night, night and day.
Like black and white.
