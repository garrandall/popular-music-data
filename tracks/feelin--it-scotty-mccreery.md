I'm feelin' it

Pop tops poppin'
Flip-flops floppin'
Drop tops droppin' down
Ray-Bans rayin'
Waves are wavin'
Ladies are layin' out
Feelin' it

iPods rockin'
Sunblock blockin'
Igloos stockin' up (yep)
Cutoffs are cuttin'
Worry 'bout nothin'
But puttin' something in my cup (feelin' it)

And I can't, I can't find nothin' wrong
With nothin', nothin' that's goin' on
It's makin' me wanna sing a song
That goes like this

Whoa, oh, whoa
Ain't nothin' like feelin' that summertime feelin'
Kicked back, relaxed, just chillin'
I'm feelin', I'm feelin' it
Whoa, oh, whoa
Ain't nothin' like diggin' that summertime
Diggin' in the sand, gettin' tan
With your hand in my hand
I'm feelin' it
Oh yeah, I'm feelin' it

Rip tide rippin'
Skim board skimmin'
Sip, sippin' somethin' on ice (fill it up)
Hot gets hotter
Head to the water
Jump into paradise (feelin' it)

And I can't, I can't find nothin' wrong
With nothin', nothin' that's goin' on
It's makin' me wanna sing a song
That goes like this (like this)

Whoa, oh, whoa
Ain't nothin' like feelin' that summertime feelin'
Kicked back, relaxed, just chillin'
I'm feelin', I'm feelin' it
Whoa, oh, whoa
Ain't nothin' like diggin' that summertime
Diggin' in the sand, gettin' tan
With your hand in my hand
I'm feelin' it
Oh, I'm feelin' it

Sunset settin'
Gettin' good's gettin'
Good as it can get
Lip gloss glossin'
No more talkin'
Baby givin' me a kiss
(Feelin' it)

Whoa, oh, whoa
Ain't nothin' like feelin' that summertime feelin'
Kicked back, relaxed, just chillin'
I'm feelin', I'm feelin' it
Whoa, oh, whoa
Ain't nothin' like diggin' that summertime
Diggin' in the sand, gettin' tan
With your hand in my hand
I'm feelin' it
Oh yeah, oh I'm feelin' it

Pop tops poppin'
iPods rockin'
Flip-flops floppin'
Oh, I'm feelin' it
