Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
It takes a lot to change a man
Hell, it takes a lot to try
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die


Nobody knows what waits for the dead
Nobody knows what waits for the dead
Some folks just believe in the things they've heard and the things they read
Nobody knows what awaits for the dead


I'm glad I can't go back to where I came from
I'm glad those days are gone, gone for good
But if I could take spirits from my past and bring 'em here
You know I would
Know I would


Nobody speaks to God these days
Nobody speaks to God these days
I'd like to think he's lookin' down and laughin' at our ways
Nobody speaks to God these days


When I was a child, they tried to fool me
Said the worldly man was lost and that a Hell was real
Well I've seen Hell in Reno
And this world's one big old Catherine wheel
Spinnin' steel


Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
It takes a lot to change your plans
And a train to change your mind
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
Oh, maybe it's time to let the old ways die
