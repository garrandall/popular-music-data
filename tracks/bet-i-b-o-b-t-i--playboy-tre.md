Put me on anything still I bet I bust
Put me anywhere on the map I bet I bust
This is what I does, so please don't gas me up
Matter of fact, gimme 15 minutes and a bag of bud
I bet I bust
I bet I bust (I, I)
I bet I bust
I bet I, I bet I, (bust)
I bet I bust
I bet I bust (I, I)
Matter of fact, gimme 15 minutes and a bag of bud I bet I bust


Bust, bust, bu-bu-bust
Yeah, on bud, bet I bust
That's just what I does, yes
Put me anywhere on the map with a backpack strapped
Still I bet I bust
Bet I flow
Bet I rip this beat
Bet I feel that soul
Bet I go
Bet I bench these niggas like Ray, sit down bro!
Bet I know, everything about this game
Bet I know my role
Plus they know when I come to the court this is my sport
B dot o, B
So, bet I go
Bet I'm on a brand new plane
Bet I'm in a whole different zone
I ain't really from this place
So I'm up all night long
Really I'm in outterspace
Really I ain't got no home
Really I'm a saint
Bet I'm blown,
Bet I'm thrown, up to the sky
Over the ocean
So I fly wherever I'm goin
When I'm by, bet I'm focused
If it's fire, you can bet I roll it
Matter of fact, you can bet I bust


Put me on anything still I bet I bust
Put me anywhere on the map I bet I bust
This is what I does, so please don't gas me up
Matter of fact, gimme 15 minutes and a bag of bud
I bet I bust
I bet I bust (I, I)
I bet I bust
I bet I, I bet I (bust)
I bet I bust
I bet I bust (I, I)
Matter of fact, gimme 15 minutes and a bag of bud I bet I bust


Gather round front and center
The king finna enter
The room with the boom and the booth, I deliver
The hottest, you prolly too small to acknowledge you
Impossible to copy like what everybody try to do
We cool as them dudes on them waves out in Malibu
I'm ballin hard baseline, Bob threw the alley-oop
BAM!
Comin through this thang like James in the air off the rim I hang
Nigga dis KANG! pretend you forgot my name if you wanna
I'm a come hard like a boner
Don't I? Make a nigga wanna revamp, turnt up, all the way, we amped
2 or 3 tramp
With 'em in the mill, same Bentley
Nigga say he do it like us, you shitting me.
96 97 in Atlanta didn't we have more blocks than Mutombo Dikembe
For those who can't hold water need a new kidney
Put it down under Australia, Sydney (bow!)
And I'm still representing,
For the niggas under prison
You are tuned in, listenin
And I'm back to doing big things
A sucka lookin for me, start in yo bitch dreams
I'm 20 feet tall standing on the big screen
Get dough, get green, my flow sickening,
It's the King nigga!


Put me on anything still I bet I bust
Put me anywhere on the map I bet I bust
This is what I does, so please don't gas me up
Matter of fact, gimme 15 minutes and a bag of bud
I bet I bust
I bet I bust (I, I)
I bet I bust
I bet I, I bet I (bust)
I bet I bust
I bet I bust (I, I)
Matter of fact, gimme 15 minutes and a bag of bud I bet I bust


Yeah, back with a cup of that liquor, nigga
Ya'll don't really know Tre,
Really know me,
Really know the streets, no!
Ya'll niggas really ain't G,
Really ain't hard,
Never really served no heart,
Ya'll be playin that roll
Talkin that pimp shit,
Never really pimp shit, nah
Ya'll be singin them hoes
But I don't, and I won't
I'll get a bitch anytime I want
I'm that guy, spit that fire
Shake the ground everytime I stomp
Beat in the trunk, cup in the air
You can talk shit but I really don't care
Man I'm in the cadillac goin direct
Gonna clack that back cause a nigga ain't scared
From that red clay, East to the A
Ya niggas get locked up everyday
Cops ain't shit so I drop that shit
Have a drop, gonna make it through the day
Grindin for my pay
It's that nigga Tre
Bustin like a pistol best believe it when I say
That I bust!


Put me on anything still I bet I bust
Put me anywhere on the map I bet I bust
This is what I does so, please donit gas me up
Matter of fact, gimme 15 minutes and a bag of bud
I bet I bust
I bet I bust (I, I)
I bet I bust
I bet I, I bet I (bust)
I bet I bust
I bet I bust (I, I)
Matter of fact, gimme 15 minutes and a bag of bud I bet I bust
