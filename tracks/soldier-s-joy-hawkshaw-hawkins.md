Some Continental soldiers on a bivouac
Were playin' stud poker in a mountain shack
But every vigilante threw down his hands
When the captain of the guard gave the sharp command


Oh Jimmy get your fiddle out and rosin up your bow
Johnny turn your banjo up, we're gonna have a show
Billy pass the jug around to Corporal McCoy
We're gonna have a tune called Soldier's Joy


The girls in Boston are dancin' tonight
The god darn redcoats are holdin' 'em tight
When we get there, we'll show 'em how
But that ain't a-doin' us no good now


Oh Jimmy get your fiddle out and rosin up your bow
Johnny turn your banjo up, we're gonna have a show
Billy pass the jug around to Corporal McCoy
We're gonna have a tune called Soldier's Joy


There goes General Washington
He's got his horse in a sweeping run
The barefoot boys are beggin' to fight
We're gonna cross the Delaware River tonight


Oh Jimmy get your fiddle out and rosin up your bow
Johnny turn your banjo up, we're gonna have a show
Billy pass the jug around to Corporal McCoy
We're gonna have a tune called Soldier's Joy


Oh we're goin' in the wilderness
Got his army in an awful mess
The farmers got mad at the British and the Huns
And they captured ten thousand of the son-of-a-guns


Oh Jimmy get your fiddle out and rosin up your bow
Johnny turn your banjo up, we're gonna have a show
Billy pass the jug around to Corporal McCoy
We're gonna have a tune called Soldier's Joy


John Paul Jones in an old tin can
Scoured the ocean like a fightin' man
The British said "Paul are you ready to strike?"
And Paul said "I'm just beginning to fight"


Oh Jimmy get your fiddle out and rosin up your bow
Johnny turn your banjo up, we're gonna have a show
Billy pass the jug around to Corporal McCoy
We're gonna have a tune called Soldier's Joy
