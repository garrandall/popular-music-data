I'm a few drinks in, but that ain't the reason
I'm all tongue-tied and my breath's leaving this fast
I can't get past
Those blue eyes shining
They keep drawing me in to you
Got me fallin' off track
You get me like that


Yeah, I'm hangin' on, hangin' on
To every word you say
Every move you make
I'm hangin' on, hangin' on
Wondering what's up next
Girl, I can't wait
Ain't nothing like spinning you around the room
Where everyone can see
You hangin' on, hangin' on to me


It ain't the song, and it ain't the playlist
It's every smile coming off of your sweet lips, yeah
That makes me wanna stay here
No, this ain't a one night, one time thing
You always light me up like a flame and it's clear
Every time you're near


Yeah, I'm hangin' on, hangin' on
To every word you say
Every move you make
I'm hangin' on, hangin' on
Wondering what's up next
Girl, I can't wait
Ain't nothing like spinning you around the room
Where everyone can see
You hangin' on, hangin' on to me
Yeah, you hangin' on to me


So let me pull you a little closer
Even when the music's over


I'll be hangin' on, hangin' on
To every word you say
Every move you make
I'm hangin' on, hangin' on
Wondering what's up next
Girl, I can't wait
Ain't nothing like spinning you around the room
Where everyone can see
You hangin' on, hangin' on to me
Yeah, you hangin' on to me
