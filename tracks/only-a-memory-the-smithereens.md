My mind is filled with thoughts of you
I think about the days of two
I search the room but you're not there
Your perfume lingers everywhere

But it's only a memory
Of what our love was going to be
Only a memory
Broken bits of you and me
Only a memory
Only a memory

In a world of pain I have no peer
You fade away and disappear
And now I have to learn the game
Where no one wins or takes the blame

But it's only a memory
Of what our love was going to be
Only a memory
Now that we are history
Only a memory
Only a memory

But it's only a memory
Of what our love was going to be
Only a memory
Broken bits of you and me
Only a memory
Only a memory

Why should it matter if I cry?
I sit around and wonder why
Now I feel much too weak to live
And I've got nothing left to give

Now it's only a memory
Of what our love was going to be
Only a memory
Broken bits of you and me
Only a memory
Only a memory

Only a memory, only a memory
Only a memory, only a memory
Only a memory, only a memory
Only a memory, only a memory

Only a memory, only a memory
Only a memory, only a memory
Only a memory, only a memory
Only a memory, only a memory

Memory
Memory
