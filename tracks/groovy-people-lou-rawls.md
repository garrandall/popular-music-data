Groovy people
I like to be around
Groovy, groovy people

I don't like nobody that's got an ego
I don't like to sit around and hold a conversation
With somebody who don't know where he wants to go

Give me the simple life
Full of fun and joy
Can't you see, I'm just a big ol' country boy

And I like groovy people
I'm talking 'bout
Groovy, down home people

I don't like nobody that's got an attitude
Walkin' 'round with their nose in the air
Them kind of people, I just can't use

I like to be relaxed
With my mind at ease
The best things in life
Is all I want for me

So give me some, groovy people
I said, groovy, groovy people
Talkin' 'bout groovy, groovy
Groovy, groovy people

Now baby, oh darlin', we don't have to put up
With them jive-time folks no more
Let's pretend that we're not at a-home
When they come knockin', knockin' on our door

I don't like nosy people
Get in my business and things
I done been through all of that, baby
And I know the bad feelings that it brings

Give me the simple life
Full of fun and joy
Can't you see I'm just a big ol' country boy?

And I like groovy people
I'm talkin' 'bout a groovy
Down home people
Talkin' 'bout groovy, groovy
Groovy, groovy people

Talkin' 'bout groovy people
(Groovy people)
I'm talking about people
(Groovy, groovy people)
That I can hold a conversation with
(Groovy people)

I'm talking about a people
(Groovy, groovy people)
That ain't goin' on no ego trip
(Groovy people)
I'm talkin' about people
(Groovy, groovy people)
That know how to love one another
(Groovy people)

I'm talking 'bout people
(Groovy, groovy people)
That know how to love their brothers
(Groovy people)
Talkin' about people
(Groovy, groovy people)
Who know how to get together
(Groovy people)

I'm talkin' about people
(Groovy, groovy people)
Who know how to brave the stormy weather
(Groovy people)
