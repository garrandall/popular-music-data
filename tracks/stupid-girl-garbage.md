You pretend you're high
Pretend you're bored
Pretend you're anything
Just to be adored
And what you need
Is what you get


Don't believe in fear
Don't believe in faith
Don't believe in anything
That you can't break


You stupid girl
You stupid girl
All you had, you wasted
All you had, you wasted


What drives you on (drives you on)
Can drive you mad (drive you mad)
A million lies to sell yourself
Is all you ever had


Don't believe in love
Don't believe in hate
Don't believe in anything
That you can't waste


You stupid girl
You stupid girl
Can't believe you fake it
Can't believe you fake it




Don't believe in fear
Don't believe in pain
Don't believe in anyone
That you can't tame


You stupid girl
You stupid girl
All you had, you wasted
All you had, you wasted
You stupid girl
You stupid girl
I can't believe you fake it
I can't believe you fake it
Stupid girl
You stupid girl
Can't believe you fake it
Can't believe you fake it


You stupid girl
