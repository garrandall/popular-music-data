The winds of fortune
Don't blow the same
She had to get out
And make a change
She had a kid now
But much too young
That baby daddy's out having fun


He's saying
I'm on a roll
With all the girls I know
His baby momma
She ain't so slow
He's saying
I'm on a roll
With all the girls I know
I know you wanna hit that
I know you wanna hit that
All the world is gettin' with, I say
Consequences are a lot, but hey
That's the way it
That's the way things go


What was a family
Is now a shell
We're raising kids now
Who raise themselves
Sex is a weapon
And it's like a drug
It gets him right into that grave that he just dug


She's saying
I'm on the run
I'm chasing guys for fun
Her baby daddy
It ain't his only one
She's saying
I'm on the run
I'm chasing guys for fun
I know you wanna hit that
I know you wanna hit that hit that
Everybody's gettin' with, I say
Consequences are a lot, but hey
That's the way it
That's the way things go


Well it winds up
Broken up
Really such a shame
But why not
Take a chance
Everything's a game
And it don't stop
Hooking up
Nothing's gonna change
The more he's trying
The more he's buying


He says
I'm on a roll
With all the girls I know
His baby momma
Don't need to know
He's saying
I'm on a roll
With all the girls I know
I know you wanna hit that
I know you wanna hit that, hit that
All the world is gettin' with, I say
Consequences are a lot, but hey
That's the way it
That's the way things go
