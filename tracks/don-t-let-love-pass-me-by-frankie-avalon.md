Why won't the moon ever shine for me
Don't know the reason why
I've been a good guy all of my life
Don't let love pass me by

Why won't the moon ever smile for me
It makes me wanna cry
I've been waiting a long, long time
Don't let love pass me by

Every night, I pray and pray
And do what I oughta do
Hope to find someone to love
Please make my dream come true

Why won't the moon ever shine for me
Don't let my dream fade and die
Just this once, please shine for me
Don't let love pass me by

I've been a good guy all of my life
Don't, don't let love pass me by
Don't let love pass me by
