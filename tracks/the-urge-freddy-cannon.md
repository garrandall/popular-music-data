(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)

When I first laid eyes on you
I got the urrrge to hold you
And the way you move your lips
I got the urrrge to kiss you
Every single little movement
Filled my heart with desire
Sends electric current through me
Like a forest fire
I got the urrrge, whoa, to love you

Now, baby, turn the lights down low
I got the urrrge to hug you
Snuggle tighter in my arms
I got the urrrge to squeeze you
Be my lovin' doll forever
Let me carry you home
'Cause I got a mind to marry you
And make you my own
I got the urrrge, whoa, to love you

Well, the way I feel for you (Yeah, yeah)
Scares me half to death (Uh-huh)
I have to count down
Just to catch my breath
I'm countin' ten (Nine)
Eight (Seven) six (five)
Four (Three) two, one

(Who's got) I got the urge
(Who's got) I got the urge
(Who's got) I got the urge
(Who's got) I got the urrrge, whoa, to love you
Yeah, whoa

(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)

Well, the way I feel for you (Yeah, yeah)
Scares me half to death (Uh-huh)
I have to count down
Just to catch my breath
I'm countin' ten (Nine)
Eight (Seven) six (five)
Four (Three) two, one

(Who's got) I got the urge
(Who's got) I got the urge
(Who's got) I got the urge
(Who's got) I got the urrrge, whoa, to love you
Yeah, move it (Whoa)

(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)

(Whoa)

(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)

(Whoa)

(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)
