She is my rock, bust at the op
Hold down the spot, beast with the box
Shawty be wet, dope in the pot
Beat down the block, the best thing I got
She is my rock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock
She is my rock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock
She is my rock, bust at the op
Hold down the spot, beast with the box
Shawty be wet, dope in the pot
Beat down the block, the best thing I got
She is my rock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock
She is my rock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock


Shawty was there 'fore I had them bands
She a lil' rider just like her friend
Her and her mama, cool as a fan
I love a woman, who love her man
What can I say? She realer than most
When things get ugly, she don't get ghost
The ship was sunkin', she stayed on the boat
I call her bae but to me, she the GOAT


She is my rock, bust at the op
Hold down the spot, beast with the box
Shawty be wet, dope in the pot
Beat down the block, the best thing I got
She is my rock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock
She is my rock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock
She is my rock, bust at the op
Hold down the spot, beast with the box
Shawty be wet, dope in the pot
Beat down the block, the best thing I got
She is my rock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock
She is my rock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock


She my lil' rock, what's mine is hers
Like shawty told me, "what's mine is yours"
She more than a hundred, that ain't even a word
Things go left, I hit her first
Things go right, I spoil her first
I give her the world, that's what she deserve
She my lil' rock, she ain't a bird
My numero uno, she can come first


She is my rock, bust at the op
Hold down the spot, beast with the box
Shawty be wet, dope in the pot
Beat down the block, the best thing I got
She is my rock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock
She is my rock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock
She is my rock, bust at the op
Hold down the spot, beast with the box
Shawty be wet, dope in the pot
Beat down the block, the best thing I got
She is my rock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock
She is my rock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock


She know how to grind, she hustle like me
Finesse for the check, she get it from me
She don't stay stagnant, she chasing her dreams
When I need a shoulder, that's where I lean
She cute in a dress, she cute in some jeans
She ain't a member, she is the team
When I'm on the go, she know where I be
She is my rock, she is my queen


She is my rock, bust at the op
Hold down the spot, beast with the box
Shawty be wet, dope in the pot
Beat down the block, the best thing I got
She is my rock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock
She is my rock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock, 'ock
