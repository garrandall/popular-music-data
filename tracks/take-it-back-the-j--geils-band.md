Think I found something that's gonna wreck my mind
Keep it close to me baby get all the time
Looked so good when I first met ya
Hold it babe I'll be back to get ya, oh yeah
Ain't gonna waste anytime with you
Hot and ready, gonna come on through
Ain't gonna hang around your door
Gonna pound it down, gonna get some more
Rip them wires right off your phone
Got to make sure we're all alone
Roll me over 'til I turn blue
Rockin' and rollin' 'til way past two
Looked so good when I first met ya
Told you then I'd be back to get ya
Looked so good when I first met ya
Told you then I'd be back to get ya
Get my 
Scramble my eggs honey, come on
It's comin' honey there it is
Throw your lovin' in my face
You know I'll take you any ol' place
Take it easy got all the time
Gotta buzz on me baby and I'm feelin' fine
Don't get shy or play polite, ha
Just shut your mouth and turn off the light
Been alone and I been blue
C'mon baby want to rock with you
Makin a mess all over the floor
Keep it going 'til I get sore
Looked so good when I first met ya
Told you then I'd be back to get ya and here I am honey
Looked so good when I first met ya
Told you then I'd be back to get ya
