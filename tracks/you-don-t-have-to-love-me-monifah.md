You don't have to love me (you don't have to love me)
You don't have to want me (anymore)
You don't have to need me (you don't have to need me)
Cuz I've got love on my side
And it's gonna be all right

Baby, I had a feeling that you were cheatin' on me
But blinded by love I couldn't see
I guess everybody plays the fool sometimes
But it's cool, yeah, it's cool
You don't have to worry about me

You don't have to love me (you don't have to love me)
You don't have to want me (anymore)
You don't have to need me (you don't have to need me)
No, no, no, no, baby
Cuz I've got love on my side
And it's gonna be all right, hey, hey

Do you believe that what goes around comes around
Just you wait and see, cuz I'm not worried 'bout a thing anymore
It doesn't follow me, it doesn't follow me, can't you see it
I don't need ya, ever need
Cuz you don't, I said you

You don't have to love me anymore (you don't have to love me)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no (anymore)
You don't have to want me (you don't have to need me)
Cuz baby, baby, cuz I've got love on my side
And it's gonna be alright, yeah, yeah

(you don't have to love me)
You don't have to want me (anymore)
You don't (you don't have to need me)
You don't have to need me
Cuz I've got love on my side
I've got love, I've got love, I've got love, I've got love
Love me no, no, I've got love, I've got love, I've got love
On my side

Ad lib until fade
