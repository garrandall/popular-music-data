Shot through the heart and you're to blame
Darlin' you give love a bad name

An angel's smile is what you sell
You promised me heaven then put me through hell
Chains of love got a hold on me
When passion's a prison you can't break free

Oh! You're a loaded gun, yeah yeah
Oh! There's nowhere to run
No one can save me the damage is done

Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
(Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
(Bad name)
You give love a bad name

Paint your smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your fingertips
A school boy's dream, you act so shy
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye

Oh! You're a loaded gun, yeah
Oh! There's nowhere to run
No one can save me
The damage is done

Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
(Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
(Bad name)
You give love!

You you give give love love
A bad bad name name n-n-name

Shot through the heart and you're to blame
Darlin' you give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
(Bad name)

Y-y-you give love a b-bad name
You give love a bad bad n-n-name
A bad name name

You give love a bad name, n-name
You give love a bad name
