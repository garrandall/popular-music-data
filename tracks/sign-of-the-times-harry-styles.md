Just stop your crying
It's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
Hope you're wearing your best clothes

You can't bribe the door
On your way to the sky
So you look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good, no

We never learn
We've been here before
Why are we always stuck here running from
The bullets, oh, the bullets

We never learn
We've been here before
Why are we always stuck here running from
The bullets, oh, the bullets

Just stop crying
It's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here

Just stop your crying
It'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

Just stop your crying
Have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
And things are pretty good from here

Remember
Everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here

We never learn
We've been here before
Why are we always stuck here running from
The bullets, the bullets

We never learn
We've been here before
Why are we always stuck here running from
The bullets, the bullets

Just stop your crying
It's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here (from here)
We gotta get away from here

Just stop your crying
It'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here
