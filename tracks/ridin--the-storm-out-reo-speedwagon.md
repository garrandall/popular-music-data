Ridin' the storm out, waitin' for the thaw out
On a full moon night in the Rocky Mountain winter.
My wine bottle's low, watching for the snow
I've been thinking lately of what I'm missing in the city.
And I'm not missing a thing
Watchin' the full moon crossing the range
Ridin' the storm out
Ridin' the storm out.

My lady's beside me, she's there to guide me.
She says that alone we've finally found home.
The wind outside is frightening,
but it's kinder than the lightning life in the city.
It's a hard life to live but it gives back what you give.
