(Tonight, ah, tonight)

I'm puttin' on my makeup
It's time to wake up
The owners of the night are calling me
I'm ready and I'm willing
To pull out the happy feeling
Something special's in the air for me

The night is mine
I'm gonna keep it just right
An angel in my pocket, right?
Feels so right
This mirror's tellin' no lie
Gonna let this magic shine


This is my night (tonight)
I'm gonna do it just right
I'm gonna let this magic shine
This is my night (tonight)
I'm gonna do it just right
I'm gonna let this magic shine

I feel like winning
I don't know the reason
Something telling me to let it ride
Got me rockin' and reeling
I don't know what the deal is
Something special I just can't describe

The night is mine
I'm gonna keep it just right
On my way to paradise
Feels so fine
Feels just like the first time
Gonna gonna let this magic shine



This is my night, this is my night, this is my night
The night is young, let it shine (come out)
This is, this is my night, this, this is my night!
This is my my my my my night, my my my...

This feels so right
This mirror's tellin' no lie
I'm gonna let this magic shine
Let it shine, let it shine

This is my night (tonight)
I'm gonna do it just right
I'm gonna let this magic shine (let it shine)
This is my night (my night)
I'm gonna do it just right
I'm gonna let this magic shine (let it shine)
This is my night (tonight)
I'm gonna do it just right
I'm gonna let this magic shine (let it shine, oh)
My night, let it shine This is my night (tonight)
I'm gonna do it just right
I'm gonna let this magic shine (let it shine on me, shine on me)
