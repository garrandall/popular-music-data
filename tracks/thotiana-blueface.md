I guess it's her fault, stupid, don't be mad at me (Don't be mad at me)
I wanna see you bust down (Bust down)
Bend that shit over, on the gang (Yeah aight)

She threw it back so I had to double back, on the gang (On the gang)
Smackin', high off them drugs (Off them drugs)
I tried tell myself two times was enough (Was enough)
