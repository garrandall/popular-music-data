Sex crime, crime
Can I take this for granted
With your eyes over me?
In this place, this wintery home
I know there's always someone in

Sex crime, sex crime
Nineteen eighty four
Nineteen eighty four

And so I face the wall
Turn my back against it all
How I wish I'd been unborn
Wish I was unliving here

Sex crime, sex crime
Sex crime, sex crime
Nineteen eighty four
Nineteen eighty four

I'll pull the bricks down
One by one
Leave a big hole in the wall
Just where you are looking in

Sex crime, sex crime
Nineteen eighty four
Nineteen eighty four
Nineteen eighty four
...
