Big man yesterday
but boy you ought to see me now
well I talked big yesterday
but boy you ought to see me now
I bragged too long that your love was strong
there'd never be another guy
but you said more when you whispered your goodbye
I was a big man yesterday
but boy you ought to see me now
I said that I was through with you
that I didn't need you anyhow
I said I didn't need you then
but boy you ought to see me now
those bragging words that you were mine
of that there was no doubt
some tempting lessons of my life walked out
half my life left me yesterday
and boy you ought to see me now
I couldn't see it yesterday
but now I know it's true
the only thing that made me big was you
I was a big man yesterday
but boy you ought to see me now
if you could only see me now
if you would only see me now
if you would only see me now
if you could only see me now
