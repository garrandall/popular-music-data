Woo! Let's go
Yea yea yea
Oh ho
Come on baby
Got to get the back
Don't ever tell an angel when your heart's on fire
She'll treat you like a stranger and she'll use her lies
Don't ever let that little girl know your one desire
Don't ever tell an angel when your heart's on fire
Never tell an angel when your heart's on fire
She will break your heart, she will make you cry
Never tell an angel when your heart's on fire
She will break your heart, she will tell you lies
My momma said "Now boy watch out you're bound to get hurt"
My daddy said go have your fun but son for what it's worth
Always keep her guessin', all that's going on inside
Don't ever tell an angel when your heart's on fire
Never tell an angel when your heart's on fire
She will break your heart, she will make you cry
Never tell an angel when your heart's on fire
She will break your heart, she will tell you lies
And when your heart is broke
It's in distress
Your heart is beatin now
A rhythm sending out an S.O.S.
If she rescues then she is true
But if she don't, she's a liar
Never tell an angel when your heart's on fire
Never tell an angel when your heart's on fire
She will break your heart, she will make you cry
Never tell an angel when your heart's on fire
She will break your heart, she will tell you lies
Never tell an angel when your hearts on fire
She'll treat you like a stranger and fill your head up full of lies
Don't ever let that little girl know what's on your mind
Don't ever tell an angel when your hearts on fire
Never tell an angel when your heart's on fire
(No, no baby)
She will break your heart, she will make you cry
(She's gonna break your heart, whoa ho ho ho)
Never tell an angel when your heart's on fire
(So watch out boy, she's gonna break your heart)
She will break your heart, she will tell you lies
(Break back, break back baby)
Never tell an angel when your heart's on fire
(Na na na na na na, whoa ho ho ho)
She will break your heart, she will make you cry
(She gonna break you, she gonna hurt you, yea she gonna hurt you)
Never tell an angel when your heart's on fire
(Hurt, hurt, hurt a little bit, hurt, hurt, hurt a little bit)
She will break your heart, she will tell you lies
(Hurt you baby, watch out baby, god help I warned you)
Never tell an angel when your heart's on fire
(Shay ya ya ya ya ya)
She will break your heart, she will make you cry
(Oh no no no)
