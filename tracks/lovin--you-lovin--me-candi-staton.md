When you smile
The woman in me shines
Where you touch me, Lord
With the look that says you're mine

In sweet surrender
With a kiss so warm and tender
It says love me, baby
And I will till the day I die

Wherever you go
I'll always be by your side
Though I may not always show it
I want you to know it

Oh, oh, oh, baby, baby
I'm so glad I found you, oh, yeah
There's so much to love about you
Just let me wrap my love around you

There's no place this side of Heaven
On God's green Earth I'd rather be
Than here, loving you loving me

Every time you gently touch my hand
I thank the Lord that
I got you for my man

'Cause you pledged with deep emotion
A lifelong devotion to me
Oh, there could never be
Love more precious
Than the one you've given me

Though I may not always show it
But I hope you know it

Oh, oh, baby, baby
I'm so glad I found you
There's so much to love about you
Oh, yeah, just let me wrap
My love around you

There's no place this side of Heaven
On God's green Earth I'd rather be
Than sitting here, loving you loving me
