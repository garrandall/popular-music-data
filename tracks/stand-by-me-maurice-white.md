When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we see
No I won't be afraid
I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand by me, stand by me

If the sea that we look upon
Should tumble and and fall
And the mountains should crumble in the sea
You know that I won't, I won't cry
Oh, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

And darling, darling
Stand by me, stand by me

You are the light that shines in my life
I reach out my hands to be with you
Let's keep on believing
You give me a reason, a reason to smile



If the sky and the mountains tumble to the sea
I'll be there as long as you stand by me

All the world come together, live in harmony
I can feel your love long as you stand by me

Like the moon feeds the ocean
Let me be your life
Baby, won't you stand by me

If the sky and the mountains tumble to the sea
Oh baby, won't you stand by me

All the world come together live in harmony
Baby, won't you stand by me
