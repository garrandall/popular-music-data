Yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I found a love, I found a love, I found a love
That I feel, whoa yeah,

I found a kiss
I just wanna tell ya that I can't resist
I found a love that I need, whoa, yeah
And I wanna call her now, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it will be, there's one thing
I wanna say right here, the way the woman walk
You set my little soul back, the ways you talk
She my heart desire and, oh, believe me,
I figured I would die if sometime I would call
Her in the midnight hour, yeah, yeah, OOW!
Don't leave me baby
Yeah, yeah, OOW!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
