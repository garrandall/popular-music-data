It's raining, it's pouring
My love-life is boring me to tears, after all these years

No sunshine, no moonlight, no stardust, no sign of romance
We don't stand a chance


I've always dreamed I found the perfect lover
But he turned out to be like every other man
Our love, our love


Raining (raining)
Pouring (pouring)
There's nothing left for us here
And we won't waste another tear


If you've had enough, don't put up with his stuff, don't you do it


If you've had your fill, get the check pay the bill, you can do it


Tell him to just get out


Nothing left to talk about


Pack his raincoat show him out


Just look him in the eye and simply shout
Enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough
Enough is enough
That's enough


If you've reached the end, don't pretend that is right when it's over


(it's over)
If the feeling is gone don't think twice just move on, get it over


(over, over)


Tell him to just get out, say it clearly, spell it out
Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough
Enough is enough
That's enough


I've always dreamed to find the perfect lover
But he turns out to be like every other man
Our love (I had no choice from the start)
Our love (I've gotta listen to my heart)
Our love (Tearing us apart)

Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough
Enough is enough
That's enough


No more tears (No more tears)
No more tears (No more tears)
No more tears (No more tears)
No more tears (No more tears)
Enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough
I've had it, you've had it he's had it, we've had is


I always dreamed I find the perfect lover


But he turned out to be like every other man


I had no choice from the start
I've gotta listen to my heart
Tearing us apart

Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Goodbye mister, goodbye, goodbye mister
Goodbye sugar

It's raining, it's pouring
There's nothing left for us here
And we won't waste another tear

No more tears
Is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough
Is enough
