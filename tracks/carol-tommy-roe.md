Oh, Carol, don't let him
Steal your heart away
I'm gonna learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day

Climb into my machine
So we can cruise on out
I know a swinging little joint
Where we can jump and shout

It's not too far
Back off the highway
Not so long a ride
You park your car
Out in the open
You can walk inside

A little cutie takes your hat
And you can thank her, maam
Every time you make the scene
You find the joint is jammed

Oh, Carol, don't let him
Steal your heart away
I'm gonna learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day

And if you wanna hear some music
Like the boys are playing
Hold tight, pat your foot
Don't let em carry it away

Don't let the heat overcome you
When they play so loud
Oh, don't the music intrigue you
When they get a crowd

If you can't dance
I know you wish you could
I got my eyes on you, baby
Cause you dance so good

Oh, Carol, don't let him
Steal your heart away
I'm gonna learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day

Don't let him steal your heart away
I've got to learn to dance
If it takes you all night and day
