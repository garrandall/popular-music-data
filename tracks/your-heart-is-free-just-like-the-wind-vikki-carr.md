Your heart is free
Just like the wind
Your hands reach out
But not for mine now

You build a
Castle out of sand
I taste the water
Not the wine now

What went wrong
Tell me how
How could you do
This thing to me, my love

Your heart is free
Just like the wind
The ring you're wearing
Isn't mine now

I feel you're
With me everywhere
And yet, you're only
In my mind now

What went wrong
Just tell me how
How could you do
This thing to me
How could you do
This thing to me, my love

Your heart is free
Just like the wind
Your hands reach out
But not for mine now

You build a
Castle out of sand
I taste the water
Not the wine now

Oh, what went wrong
Tell me how
How could you do
This thing to me, my love

Your heart is free
Oh, just like the wind
I was the giver
Not a taker

Oh, we have a life
So we must live
Although we
Cannot be together

What went wrong
Tell me how
How could you do
This thing to me
How could you do
This thing to me, my love

How could you do
This thing to me, my love
