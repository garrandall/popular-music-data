There's not much of a trick to playing safely baby
People do it every day
You can see them living sensibly with lots of care
Lonely in a cautious way

You be alone for me
I'll be alone for you
One and one people alone make two
Let's stir things up a bit
Throw the pieces up to the sky

Baby i want scary kisses
I want hits and i want misses
I want hell and i want bliss
And that stuff between it
And you gave me safety and
The showtime all that drove me crazy
I would rather run and fall then take no chance at all
Then take no chance at all

I would rather sit here by myself
Then settle down with someone safe and sound
I kinda like a little trouble every now and then
Someone with enough to break ground

You take a look for me
I'll take a look for you
We'll find it's not so bad it's just new
Let's stir things up a bit
Throw the pieces up to the sky

Baby i want scary kisses
I want hits and i want misses
I want hell and i want bliss
And that stuff between it
And you gave me safety and
The showtime all that drove me crazy
I would rather run and fall then take no chance at all

And if we break or if we bruise
It won't be the worst of news
We will just get up again start over on the count of ten
And if we scar or if we break
It will be our own mistake
Put it down to what we know
Then have another go

And take another chance
And just begin again
Run your finger through the flame
And i will do the same
Together we will fall
Together we will rise
Together we will do everything
But compromise

Baby i want scary kisses
I want hits and i want misses
I want hell and i want bliss
And that stuff between it
And you gave me safety and
The showtime all that drove me crazy
I would rather run and fall then take no chance at all

And if we break or if we bruise
It won't be the worst of news
We will just get up again start over on the count of ten
And if we scar or if we break
It will be our own mistake
Put it down to what we know
Then have another go

Baby i want scary kisses
I want hits and i want misses
I want hell and i want bliss
And that stuff between it
And you gave me safety and
The showtime all that drove me crazy
I would rather run and fall then take no chance at all
