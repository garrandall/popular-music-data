I don't want to get up, baby lets turn off the phone
I don't want to go to work today or even put my make-up on
I got better things to do on my to-do list anyway
Hide under the covers and waste away the day


Let's just lay here and be lazy, baby drive me crazy
All I want to do...
All I want to do... is love you

I got my whole life to change the world and climb ladders
Looking at you looking at me is the only thing that matters
Come a little closer baby we can talk without words
Hang a sign on the door, "Please do not disturb"



Give me a kiss, from that Elvis lip
You don't want to miss this

All I want to do...
All I want to do... is love you

All I really want to do is
All I really want to do is
All I really want to do is love you and love you and love you

Come a little closer baby we can talk without words
Hang a sign on the door,
"Please do not, please do not, please do not, please do not disturb"

When I lay down in the evening
All I really want to do is
When I wake up when I wake up in the morning baby
All I really want to do is

Ooo...
Ooo...
