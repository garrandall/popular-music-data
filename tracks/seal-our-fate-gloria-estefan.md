They say it's never too late and
Though that might be the case sometimes
The sad truth of it is opportunity won't knock twice
You can put off until tomorrow
But tomorrow might never come
Gotta think about the future
'cause today soon will be long gone

Where will you be a few years down the line,
Will it be everything you've dreamed of
It's always harder to do what is right
Sometimes one bad decision can mess up your life

We seal our fate with the choices we make
But don't give a second thought
To the chances we take
Could come up anytime
Better we be wide awake 'cause we
Seal our fate with the choices we make
Seal our fate, seal our fate, seal our fate,
Seal our fate with the choices we make

Surely, you say, it's not as bad as
You make it sound
If we make a mistake
You can alsways turn it back around
Get back on the straight and narrow
When I'm through having all my fun
After all it's m,y decision,
I'm not reeally hurting anyone

Before you know it's gotten way out of hand
In ways that you had never dreamed of
Never worth the price you pay in the end
Instead of being ahead you're starting over again

We seal our fate with the choices we make
But don't give a second thought
To the chances we take
Could come up anytime
Better we be wide awake 'cause we
Seal our fate with the choices we make
Seal our fate, seal our fate, seal our fate,
Seal our fate with the choices we make
