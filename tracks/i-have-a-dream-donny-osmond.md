I have a dream that someday
We'll all walk hand in hand
I have a dream that someday
This is gonna be a better land
Well maybe you can't see my meaning
And you can't see my dreaming
But I'm sure someday you'll understand
It'll all be better if we get it together
And dream, mmm, dream

I have a dream that someday
We'll all walk hand in hand
I have a dream that someday
This is gonna be a better land
Well maybe you can't see my meaning
And you can't see my dreaming
But I'm sure someday you'll understand
It'll all be better if we get it together
And dream, dream, dream

Oh how sweet the words
Love and peace sound to our ears
For the one thing wrong, my friends
Too many say these words
Not enough are sincere
And all the words of freedom, liberty
Stand out in my soul and my mind
Tears come to my eyes and I realize
Oh, it's just a crime, woah, oh oh

I have a dream that someday
We'll all walk hand in hand
I have a dream that someday
This is gonna be a better land
Well maybe you can't see my meaning
And you can't see my dreaming
But I'm sure someday you'll understand
It'll all be better
If we get it together and dream
It'll all be better
If we get it together and dream
