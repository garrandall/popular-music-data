Children, go where I send you
(How will you send me)
I'm gonna send you to that land
The land of a thousand dances
You gotta know how to pony
Like boney maronie


You gotta know how to twist
Stroll like this
Mashed potato
Do the alligator
Twist the twister
Like little sister


Then you get your ya yo
Say, hey, let's go, go
Get out on your knees
Do the sweet peas


Roll over on your back
Say I like it like that
Do the watusi
Do the watusi


Can you do the fly
With a hand jive
Can you do the slot
The chicken in the pot
Can you do the fish
Slow, slow twist
Can you do the flow
Got to move so low


Can you do the tango
It takes two to tango
Bye bye, children
Bye bye, children
Bye bye, children
Come on, children


I wanna show you
This little place
Across the track
The name of this place
Is I like it like that


The name of the band
The Twistolettes
Come on, children
I wanna show you
I wanna show you
I wanna show you
Come on, children
