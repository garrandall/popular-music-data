One, two, three
One, two, three
Ow! Uh! Alright! Uh!

Got to know how to Pony
Like Bony Moronie
Mash Potato
Do The Alligator
Put your hand on your hips, yeah
Let your backbone slip
Do the Watusi
Like my little Lucy

Ow! Uh!
Na, na-na na-na
Na-na na-na
Na-na na-na na-na
Na-na na-na
Need somebody help me say it one time!
Na, na-na na-na
Na-na na-na
Na-na na-na na-na
Na-na na-na

Wow!
Ow!
Uh!
You know I feel alright?
Hah!
Feel pretty good, y'all
Uh-hah!

Na, na-na na-na
Na-na na-na
Na-na na-na na-na
Na-na na-na
C'mon y'all, let's say it one mo' time!
Na, na-na na-na
Na-na na-na
Na-na na-na na-na
Na-na na-na

Ohh!

Dancin' in the alley
With Long Tall Sally
Twistin' with Lucy
Doin' the Watusi
Roll over on your back
I like it like that
Do that Jerk, oh
Watch me work, y'all

Ow! Do it!
Wow! Do it!
Watch me do it
Ohh, help me!
Ohh, help me!
Ohh, help me!
Ohh, help me!
