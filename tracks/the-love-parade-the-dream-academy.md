Look out of your window on any day
From June to September the love parade's
Out on the street where you live and you know
It's just a matter of time before it takes over
They've been married for so many years
Now a young love serenade blows sweet nothing in her ear
They're lonely together, when they're not apart
It feels like she's holdin' on to someone else in the dark

The love parade is on
Even against all odds
It'll go on forever
The love parade
The love parade
Only matinee shows
The love parade

But if he could put himself into a different skin
He'd be worryin' about what he'd let himself in for
Hangin' in the air apparent
A point of view almost transparent
So you sold your soul for a pocket full of sweet talk
Given up kisses at the end of a slow walk
And when it's done you put your world back on
'Cause she's otherwise engaged married to someone

Oh the love parade goes on
Even when you're gone
It'll go on forever
The love parade
The love parade
Only matinee shows
The love parade

Everybody knows
The love parade
Married to someone
Married to someone oh
Everybody knows
Body everybody everybody every when

This is dedicated to the one I love
This is dedicated to the one I love
This is dedicated to the one I love
