Got a good reason for
Taking the easy way out
Got a good reason for
Taking the easy way out

He was a day tripper
One way ticket, yeah
It took me so long to
Find out, and I found out

He's a big teaser
He took me half the way there
He's a big teaser
He took me half the way there

He was a day tripper
One way ticket, yeah
It took me so long to
Find out, and I found out

Tried to please him
He only played one night stands
Tried to please him
He only played one night stands

He was a day tripper

It took me so long to
Find out, and I found out

Day tripper
One way ticket to ride
I found out
Day tripper
One way ticket to ride
I found out
