 I used to go my way all by myself, me, my shadow & I 
Happy-go-lucky, nobody else but me, my shadow & I 
One day out of the clear blue skies 
I dared to look in your eyes 
So tenderly, that's how love fell on me, yes indeed

 I used to laugh at all my friends 
Gettin' ready for Valentines Day 
Givin' candy & kisses & friendship rings 
"Sweets for the sweet," they say 
One day when the sun was warm 
I couldn't help but take you in my arms 
So tenderly, that's how love fell on me

 Listen, Kim: it didn't hit me like a ton of bricks 
But I felt it just the same 
 Marvin, love came creepin' right into my heart 
When you whispered my name 
So sweet & tender, I had to surrender 
I knew I had really been hit 
 So tenderly, that's how love fell on me 
So tenderly, that's how love fell on me

 I couldn't help myself at all 
 You know, you came along & I had to fall 

 So tenderly, that's how love fell on me
