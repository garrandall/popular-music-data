Strollin' in the park
Watchin' winter turn to spring
Walkin' in the dark
Seein' lovers do their thing

Oo-oo-ooh
That's the time
I feel like makin' love to you
That's the time
I feel like makin' dreams come true, oh Baby

When you talk to me
When you're moanin' sweet and low
When you're touchin' me
And my feelin's start to show

Oo-oo-ooh
That's the time
I feel like makin' love to you
That's the time
I feel like makin' dreams come true, oh Baby

In a restaurant
holdin' hands by candlelight
While I'm touchin' you
Wanting you with all my might

Oo-oo-ooh
That's the time
I feel like makin' love to you
That's the time
I feel like makin' dreams come true, oh Baby

Strollin' in the park
Watchin' winter turn to spring
Walkin' in the dark
Seein' lovers do their thing

Oo-oo-ooh
That's the time
I feel like makin' love to you
