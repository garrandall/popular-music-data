I'm going to Kansas City
Kansas City, here I come
I'm going to Kansas City
Kansas City, here I come
They got a crazy
Way of loving there
I'm gonna get me some
I'm gonna be
Standing on the corner
On the corner of
Twelfth Street and Vine
I'll be standing on the corner
On the corner of
Twelfth Street and Vine
With my Kansas City baby
The one I call Miss KC fine
Well, I might take a train
I might take a plane
But if I have to walk
I'm going there just the same
I'm going to Kansas City
Kansas City, here I come
They got a crazy
Way of loving there
And I'm gonna get me some
I'm gonna pack my clothes
Leave at the break of dawn
I'm gonna pack my clothes
Leave at the break of dawn
Well, everybody in Cleveland
Nobody will know where I've gone
Cause if I stay in this town
I know I'm gonna die
Gotta find a pretty city
And that's the reason why
I'm going to Kansas City
Kansas City, here I come
They have a crazy
Way of loving there
I'm gonna get me some
