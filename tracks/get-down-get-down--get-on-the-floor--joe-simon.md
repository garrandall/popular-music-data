Up, high, down, low 
I be anywhere you want 
Not the one but slipping, 
but I'm sliding in yo Mary go
Ram like the size of them wheels that's on a Chevy though 
Ass so retarded, the homies calling you radio 
I get it on the floor 
When I beat I do my DougieDough
Gorilla, yes I am aka Mr. ma-Mighty Joe 
Simon says do this & I say do that 
I'm hoping out that whip
while yo chick saying who that 


It's the way I gotta be 
It's not changing 
Hell I got in front of me 
but I'm choosing 
If you think you can handle me, 
then get in here now 
& baby gimme what you ga-got 
I'll show you all the goods & ill turn you out 
Don't be acting like you don't want it now 
Lemme apologize cause imma wear you out 


I get around, I get around (I do that) 
I get, I get, I get, I get 
I get around, I get around (I do that) 

 
Shawty so bad, got me like 'oooo' 
Louis V. bag, Louis V. shoes 
Shawty got class, aint no need for school 
She got swagg, swagg, swagg like... 
No photos, look at her frame 
Bentley two doors, switchin up lanes 
Hit the airport we switchin up planes, planes, planes like... 


I get around, I get around (I do that) 
I get, I get, I get, I get 
I get around, I get around (I do that) 




I get around, I get around (I do that) 
I get, I get, I get, I get 
I get around, I get around (I do that)
