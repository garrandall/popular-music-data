A boy is a specimen of masculine things
That's biology
A girl is a specimen of feminine things
That's biology

A girl is a scientific joy to a boy
And you're a girl
And I'm a boy
And baby, that's biology

A boy has a positive reaction to the dark
Who loves to go and park
A girl has a negative reaction that is strong
But not for very long

A girl is a scientific joy to a boy
And you're a girl
And I'm a boy
And baby, that's biology

When we touch our fingertips
Electricity
Every time we touch our lips
Booo, biology

A boy really has to hold a girl in his arms
To study all her charms
A girl has an obligation never to resist
Not at a time like this

A girl is a scientific joy to a boy
And you're a girl
And I'm a boy
And baby, that's biology

A-when, a-when we touch our fingertips
Electricity
Every time we touch our lips
Booo, biology

A boy really has to hold a girl in his arms
To study all her charms
A girl has an obligation never to resist
Not at a time like this

A girl is a scientific joy to a boy
And you're a girl
And I'm a boy
And baby, that's biology

Biology
Uh-oh
