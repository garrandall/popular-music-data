Now there's no storyline
Just a real good time
And I don't want to seem to be mistaken
But there's a tale to tell
On this road to hell
It's in between the lines the case I'm making

Oh, lord, look my way
Save me from these crazy things I see
I don't know what's going on round here these days
But I can't dance to that
Oh, I can't dance to that
So let me dance to this
'Cos I can't dance to that

If you'll excuse me please
You see I got to go
And take myself before I'm past redemption
A voice is calling out
As if I didn't know
This wretched road is paved with good intentions
All the way
Down this Judas track
I know it so well
And I ain't going back
I don't know what happened to the good time songs
But I can't dance to that
Oh, I can't dance to that
So let me dance to this
'Cos I can't dance to that

Tell me what you know
Take away these chains
What stood in front of me it looks so pretty
But I can't dance to a cold machine
Oh, lord, and every drummer you know just what I mean
Oh, I can't dance to that
So let me dance to this
