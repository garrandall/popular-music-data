People living by a constalation
Everybody wants to be a star
People living in my generation
They're making movies in the singles bar
Look at them dancing the night away
Have you fogotten how to be a lover
Have you fogotten how to be sincere
Used to be we could talk to one another
Now you're just saying what I want here


Make it mean something
Make it mean something when I say you do
Make it mean something
Make it mean something when you say I love you

How can you promise you heart to a stranger
How can you tell him all those pretty lies
You will put your soul in terrible danger
Can't you see it baby, don't you realize



Hurt me if you got to
Go ahead say goodbye
Do what you got to
Don't be telling me no lies

Never be afraid to flirt with someone
Never be afraid to get in too deep
Never be afraid to hurt somebody
Time is precious, talk is cheap
