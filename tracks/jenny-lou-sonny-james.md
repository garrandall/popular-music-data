I was put here by a jury
Of 12 good men and true
For myself, I wouldn't worry
But what about Jenny Lou


What'll they do to her, what'll they do to her
What'll they do to my darling
Will they go blamin' her, taunting and shaming her
After I'm gone away


Since the main street was deserted
They all believe the worst
There was only me and Jenny
Could swear it was him drew first
They believed I meant to kill him
Although he'd been my pal
There was real bad blood between us
For Jenny was once his gal


What'll they do to her, what'll they do to her
What'll they do to my darling?
Will they go blamin' her, taunting and shaming her
After I'm gone away?


Now, they'll make my Jenny suffer
For her good name is gone
How his brother's lied by sayin'
That Jenny had led him on
They'll be comin' in the morning
To take me to a tree
Oh, when I think how they'll treat Jenny
I wish it was him killed me


What'll they do to her, what'll they do to her
What'll they do to my darling?
Will they go blamin' her, taunting and shaming her
After I'm gone away?
What'll they do to her, what'll they do to her
After I'm gone away?
