Gotta make a change, 
For once in my life, 
It's gonna feel real good, 
Gonna make a difference, 
Gonna make it right. 

As I turned up the collar on, 
My favorite winter coat, 
This wind is blowin' my mind, 
I see the kids in the street, 
With not enough to eat, 
Who am I to be blind, 
Pretending not to see their needs. 

A summer's disregard, 
A broken bottle top, 
And a one man's soul, 
They follow each other, 
On the wind ya' know, 
'Cause they got nowhere to go, 
That's why I want you to know. 

I'm starting with the man in the mirror, 
I'm asking him to change his ways, 
And no message could have been any clearer, 
If you wanna make the world a better place, 
Take a look at yourself and then make a change, 
Na na na, na na na, na na na na. 

I've been a victim of, 
A selfish kinda love, 
It's time that I realize, 
There are some with no home, 
Not a nickel to loan, 
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone. 

A willow deeply scarred, 
Somebody's broken heart, 
And a washed out dream, 
(Washed out dream), 
They follow the pattern of the wind ya' see, 
'Cause they got no place to be, 
That's why I'm starting with me. 

I'm starting with the man in the mirror, 
I'm asking him to change his ways, 
And no message could have been any clearer, 
If you wanna make the world a better place, 
Take a look at yourself and then make a change. 

I'm starting with the man in the mirror, 
I'm asking him to change his ways, 
And no message could have been any clearer, 
If you wanna make the world a better place, 
Take a look at yourself and then make a change. 

I'm starting with the man in the mirror, 
(Man in the mirror, oh yeah), 
I'm asking him to change his ways, yeah, 
(Change), 
No message could have been any clearer, 
If you wanna make the world a better place, 
Take a look at yourself and then make the change, 
You gotta get it right, while you got the time, 
'Cause when you close your heart, 
(You can't close your, your mind), 
Then you close your mind. 

(That man, that man, that man), 
(That man, that man, that man), 
(With the man in the mirror, oh yeah), 
(That man you know, that man you know), 
(That man you know, that man you know), 
I'm asking him to change his ways, 
(Change), 
No message could have been any clearer, 
If you wanna make the world a better place, 
Take a look at yourself then make that change. 

(Na na na, na na na, na na na na), 
Ooh, 
Oh yeah, 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, 
(Na na na, na na na, na na na na). 

Oh no, 
Oh no, I'm gonna make a change, 
It's gonna feel real good, 
Sure mon, 
(Change), 
Just lift yourself, 
You know, you got to stop it yourself, 
(Yeah), 
Oh, 
Make that change, 
(I gotta make that change today, oh), 
(Man in the mirror), 
You got to, you got to not let yourself, brother oh, 
Yeah, 
You know that, 
(Make that change), 
(I gotta make that make me then make), 
You got, you got to move, 
Sure mon, sure mon, 
You got to, 
(Stand up, stand up, stand up), 
Make that change, 
Stand up and lift yourself, now, 
(Man in the mirror), 
Make that change, 
(Gonna make that change, sure mon), 
(Man in the mirror), 
You know it, you know it, you know it, you know,, 
(Change), 
Make that change.
