Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman

Time to turn on
Love me every night
Looking at you looking at me, Mary, Mary
Now the two of you, love me every night
Looking at you looking that's the real thing

You want the real thing
Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman
You want the real thing, Mary
You want the real thing
Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman
You want the real thing

Time to turn on
Love me every night
Looking at you looking at me, my Mary, my Mary
Now the two of you, love me every night
Looking at you looking at me, my Mary, my Mary

Time to turn on
Love me every night (when you got it, you know)
Looking at you looking at me, my Mary, my Mary (he's got it, and he shows it)
Now the two of you, love me every night ()
Looking at you looking at me, my Mary, my Mary

Time to turn on
Looking at you looking at me, my Mary, my Mary

Time to turn on
Looking at you looking at me, my Mary, my Mary
