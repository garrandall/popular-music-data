We can dance if we want to
We can leave your friends behind
Cause your friends don't dance 
And if they don't dance then their no friends of mine

We can go where we want to
A place where they'll never find
We can act like we've come from out of this world
Leave the real one far behind

And we can dance or sing

We can go when we want to 
The night is young and so am I
And we can dress real neat from our hats to our feet
And surprise 'em with the victory cry

Say, we can act if we want to 
If we don't, nobody will
And you can act real rude and totally removed
And I can act like an imbecile

And say, we can dance, we can dance
Everything's out of control
We can dance, we can dance
They're doing it from wall to wall
We can dance, we can dance
Everybody look at your hands
We can dance, we can dance
Everybody's taking, taking little chance

We can dance if we want to
We've got all your life and mine
As long as we abuse it, never gonna lose it
Everything'll work out right

I say, we can dance if we want to
We can leave your friends behind
Because your friends don't dance and if they don't dance
Well, they're no friends of mind

And say, we can dance, we can dance
Everything's out of control
We can dance, we can dance
They're doing it from wall to wall
We can dance, we can dance
Everybody look at your hands
We can dance, we can dance
Everybody's taking, taking little chance

The safety dance
