We can dance if we want to
We can leave your friends behind
'Cause your friends don't dance
And if they don't dance
Well they're no friends of mine

I say, we can go where we want to
A place where they'll never find
And we can act like we come from out of this world
Leave the real one far behind
We can dance (Dansez!)

We can go where we want to
The night is young and so am I
And we can dress real neat
From our hands to our feet
And surprise 'em with a victory cry

I say, we can act if we want to
If we don't nobody will
And you can act real rude
And totally removed
And I can act like an imbecile
I say, we can dance, we can dance
Everything is out of control
We can dance, we can dance
We're doing it from wall to wall
We can dance, we can dance
Everybody look at your hands
We can dance, we can dance
Everybody's taking the chance

Safe to dance
Well it's safe to dance
Yes, it's safe to dance

We can dance if we want to
We've got all your life and mine
As long as we abuse it
Never gonna lose it
Everything will work out right

I say, We can dance if we want to
We can leave your friends behind
'Cause your friends don't dance
And if they don't dance
Well they're no friends of mine

I say, we can dance, we can dance
Everything is out of control
We can dance, we can dance
We're doing it from wall to wall
We can dance, we can dance
Everybody look at your hands
We can dance, we can dance
Everybody's taking the chance

Well it's safe to dance
Yes, it's safe to dance
Well it's safe to dance
Well it's safe to dance
Yes it's safe to dance
It's safe to dance
Well it's safe to dance
It's a safety dance
It's a safety dance
It's a safety dance
It's a safety dance
It's a safety dance
