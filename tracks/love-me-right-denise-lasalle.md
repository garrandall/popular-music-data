Don't want to see no movie
Don't turn on no tv
You see I got a condition baby
That's been worrying me
I've been neglected too long baby
While you're loving someone else
It's time I take the time out
To get a little lovin for myself

Loving you
That's all that's on my mind tonight
I can't let you go
Till you love me right
Honey, loving you
That's all that's on my mind tonight
I can't let you go
Till you do it to me right

You can call your other woman
Tell her you all tied up tonight (stayin in)
Cause when I let you go baby
It's going to be broad daylight
If she still want to see you
See you when I get through
She's welcome to all of the loving
You gonna have left in you

Cause loving you
That's all that's on my mind tonight
I can't let you go
Till you love me right
Honey, loving you
That's all that's on my mind tonight
I ain't gonna let you go
Till you do it to me right

(Love me right)
My mother's got the children
They're gonna spend the night
I disconnected the telephone
And I turned down the lights
I know you know how to love me
You used to be an expert
I fixed you a good dinner baby
Let me be your dessert

Honey loving you
That's all that's on my mind tonight
I can't let you go
Till you love me right
Honey, loving you
Can't you see that's all that's on my mind tonight
I ain't gonna let you go
Till you do it to me right

Baby, loving you
That's all that's on my mind tonight
I can't let you go
Till you love me right
Honey, loving you
That's all that's on my mind tonight
I can't gonna let you go
Till you do it to me right

Oh baby (love me right)
Oh baby (come on and love me right)
Oh baby (love me right)
Oh baby (come on and love me right)

Love me right (love me right)
Love me right (come on and love me right)

I know you know how to do it
Come on and love me right
You know I need you
Got to have you
You know I love you
You know how much I need you
Oh baby
Oh baby
Come on and do it
Come on do it
You know how to do it
You know how to do it baby
Just have to love me right
Love me right
Love me right
You know how to love me right
Even how long I like it
You know every way I like it baby
Come on and do it
