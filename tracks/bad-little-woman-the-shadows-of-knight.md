You're a bad little woman
You're a bad little woman
You're 'bout to ruin me baby
With your bad, bad ways

He drives a big shiny Cadillac
Yeah a big shiny Cadillac
And he's evil too
Yeah he's evil too

He said he loves you baby
Just like I love you
He said he loves you baby
Just like I love you
Woh no no
He got it all
No no no
It's not true
Nooo

He brought you home last night
Smelled like Gypsy Rose
Now I don't know just where you been
He only knows

He said he loves you baby
Just like I love you
He said he loves you baby
Just like I love you
Woh no no
No no no
It's not true
No no
No no no
It's not true
Nooo
