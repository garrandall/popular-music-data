I got mixed emotions
Did I finally find me a river that could lead me out to the ocean?
'Cause I've only ever known the kind of love
That leaves you battered and broken
So forgive me for my mixed emotions, yeah yeah


I'm not that kind of person
Who can fall in and out of love with you
That's not what love's supposed to do
I'm not that kind of person
Who can fall in and out of love with you
That's not what love's supposed to do


Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
'Cause it's the only one I've got
'Cause it's the only one I've got


Am I being too open?
'Cause I told you everything I have to say
And now we're having a moment
Does it make you wanna pack up all your things
And drive away like you stole it?
Just forgive me if I'm being too open
No no no no, yeah yeah yeah


I'm not that kind of person
Who can fall in and out of love with you
That's not what love's supposed to do
(What love's supposed to do)
I'm not that kind of person
Who can fall in and out of love with you
That's not what love's supposed to do


Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
'Cause it's the only one I've got
'Cause it's the only one I've got
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
'Cause it's the only one I've got
'Cause it's the only one I've got


I've been broken, I've been bruised
But now I'm all in 'cause of you
So if you're gonna love me, love me right, yeah
But if you're gonna be someone that hurts somebody just for fun
Then do it to a heart that isn't mine


Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart (Woo)
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart (Don't, don't, don't)
'Cause it's the only one I've got (Yeah)
'Cause it's the only one I've got (Yeah)
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
'Cause it's the only one I've got
It's the only one, it's the only one I got
'Cause it's the only one I've got (Got, oh)
Baby, don't go
