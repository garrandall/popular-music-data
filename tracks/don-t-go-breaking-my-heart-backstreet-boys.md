R-I-P Abbro, GDots
Dun know

I'm living good and I'm (eating!), So I know dey' hate (I know it!)
They'll snake you for a cap change, bro I know they fake (I know it!)
And ah' couple man gotta hide from me, but I know they face (Don't show it!)
Undercover Pigs tryna follow me, but I know they plates

Cuh' they scheming
Billy's coming home squeezing
Gotta watch who you ride in the street wit'
Gotta watch who you lie in the sheet wit'
You gotta watch who you lighting ya weed wit'
Niggas talking in secret (Their Chatting!)
I know dat deez' gal are your weakness
You talk to the hookers 'bout street shit (That's Bad!)
You give dem' all stories of remix (You Lie!)
I just stepped on this yayo wit' remix
I'm smashing this hooker, she skeeting (She's Gone!)
I don't talk to deez' hookers bout feelings (I Don't!)
I put raw in a cooker and beat it! (Whip Dat!)
I got ah' foreign ting', and her batty so big
I can't rip off her jeans, gotta peel it (It's Mad!)
Let my little bro slice off and deal it
I got 63 stacked to the ceiling

I'm living good and I'm (eating!), So I know dey' hate (I know it!)
They'll snake you for a cap change, bro I know they fake (I know it!)
And ah' couple man gotta hide from me, but I know they face (Don't show it!)
Undercover Pigs tryna follow me, but I know they plates

I'm out 'ere on dis' backstreet
I told the feds to come catch me (Come Get Me!)
I know some man dey wan' slap me (Get Me!)
That's why all my poles' they got battrees
And that's tic-tac
I don't wear my watch without ah flick-shank (I Dont!)
One funny move and I dip man! (Dip Him!)
Free Melo that's my hitman! (Bro!)
Just ah hot-sec till' the kid land
I don't take chat from 'Bigman' (No Way!)
I'm ah young nigga wit big plans
The cowboy came with kickback
I made 15 bags off ah 6pack
I been gassed! (Been Gassed!)
I'm Harrow Road Boy and I been dat! (Been Dat!)
I heard ya mixtape bro I been dat! (Been Dat!)
The plug still phones for his tings' back (Tings' Back!)
I'm still out 'ere on the low
Give me 4-een for ah O' (You Can Get It!)
I was 4-een shirting snow (Young G!)
I had 4 fiends in my phone
That was 0-9 (Way Back!)
I was ah 'Young G' I didn't know life
Thought all I needed was a phone-line
But it's so much more to the road-side
It broke my heart when bro died (Dots!)
I told him
We used to ride bikes that were stolen
We used to slide by tryna poke him (My Bro!)
You was ah hype guy, you was ah soldier
Now time flies and I'm older
Tryna picture you all grown up (It's Mad!)
It just fucks with me, I don't know cuz
I don't know love

I'm living good and I'm (eating!), So I know dey' hate (I know it!)
They'll snake you for a cap change, bro I know they fake (I know it!)
And ah' couple man gotta hide from me, but I know they face (Don't show it!)
Undercover Pigs tryna follow me, but I know they plates

I'm living good and I'm (eating!), So I know dey' hate (I know it!)
They'll snake you for a cap change, bro I know they fake (I know it!)
And ah' couple man gotta hide from me, but I know they face (Don't show it!)
Undercover Pigs tryna follow me, but I know they plates
