Listen everybody let me tell you 'bout the rock 'n' roll
Feel that rhythm and it's really gonna thrill your soul
She said come along with me, to a land of make believe
She said rock 'n' roll is king

She loves that rock 'n' roll and she plays it all night long
That's all she ever tells me when I call her on the telephone
She says feel that jumpin' beat, and git up on your feet
She says rock 'n' roll is king


Oh let those guitars play
Play for me play for me
Oh let that song ring out
That's how it's meant to be

It rolls like a train that's comin' on down the track
She rolled over Beethoven and she gave Tchaikovsky back
She loves that drivin' beat, she goes dancin' on down the street
She said rock 'n' roll is king



When she comes around and I'm listenin' to the radio
She says you can't do that 'cause all I wanna do is rock 'n' roll
Now here I'm gonna stay where that music starts to play
She says rock 'n' roll is king
