If you don't believe I'm leavin'
Just count the days I'm gone yeah
If you don't believe I'm leavin'
Just count the days I'm gone yeah
I gave you my heart
You gave me hurt
I gave you sugar
You gave me dirt
You said that I wouldn't have the nerve to leave
And if I did I'd be the one to grieve
If you don't believe I'm leavin'
Count the days I'm gone yeah
No more tears, I got someone new
To do the things you refused to do
I want to be square don't want perfection
I would never want you? Affection
If you don't believe I'm leavin'
Just count the days I'm gone yeah
Oh you won't have the chance again to treat me wrong
It's been a long, long time comin'
And I?
If you don't believe I'm leavin'
Just count the days I'm gone yeah
If you don't believe I'm leavin'
Just count the days I'm gone yeah
