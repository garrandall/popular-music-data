I am the one and only oh yeah
Call me, call me by my name or call me by my number
You put me through it
I'll still be doing it the way I do it
And yet, you try to make me forget
Who I really am, don't tell me I'm no best
I'm not the same as all the rest

I am the one and only
Nobody I'd rather be
I am the one and only
You can't take that away from me
I've been a player in the crowd scene

A flicker on the big screen
My soul embraces one more in a million faces
High hopes and aspirations, and years above my station
Maybe but all this time I've tried to walk with dignity and pride
I can't wear this uniform without some compromises

Because you'll find out that we come

In different shapes and sizes
No one can be myself like I can
For this job I'm the best man
And while this may be true, you are the one and only you
(Twice)
