Some people run, some people crawl
Some people don't even move at all
Some roads lead forward some roads lead back
Some roads are bathed in light, some wrapped in fearful black

Time oh time where did you go
Time oh good, good time where did you go

Some people never get, some never give
Some people never die and some never live
Some folks treat me mean, some treat me kind
Most folks just go their way, don't pay me any mind

Time oh time where did you go
Time oh good, good time where did you go

Sometimes I'm satisfied, sometimes I'm not
Sometimes my face is cold, sometimes it's hot
Sunset I laugh, sunrise I cry
At midnight I'm in between and wondering why

Time oh time where did you go
Time oh good good time where did you go

Time oh time where did you go
Time oh good good time where did you go
