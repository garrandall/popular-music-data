Heaven bend to take my hand
And lead me through the fire
Be the long awaited answer
To a long and painful fight
Truth be told, I've tried my best
But somewhere 'long the way
I got caught up in all there was to offer
And the cost was so much more than I could bear


Though I've tried
I've fallen, I have sunk so low
I messed up
Better, I should know
So don't come 'round here
And tell me "I told you so"


We all begin with good intent
When love was raw and young
We believe that we can change ourselves
The past can be undone
But we carry on our back the burden time always reveals
In the lonely light of morning
In the wound that would not heal
It's the bitter taste of losing everything
That I've held so dear


I've fallen, I have sunk so low
I messed up
Better, I should know
So don't come 'round here
And tell me "I told you so"
Oh

Heaven bend to take my hand
I've nowhere left to turn
I'm lost to those I thought were friends
To everyone I know
Oh they turn their heads embarrassed
Pretend that they don't see
That it's one missed step one slip before you know it
And there doesn't seem a way to be redeemed


Though I've tried
I've fallen, I have sunk so low
I messed up
Better, I should know
So don't come 'round here
And tell me I told you so
Oh, I messed up
Better, I should know
So don't come 'round here
And tell me "I told you so"
