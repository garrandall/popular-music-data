Fairs

I first saw you in a magazine
I wanna meet you
I wanna meet you
I wanna meet you

I'll be in love if you're as cute as you seem
I wanna meet you

It may take some time to discover
What kind of girl you might be
From the look on your face
It seems you need someone
And I'm hoping it could be me

I'll look you up where you want to be seen
I wanna meet you
I wanna meet you
I wanna meet you

Although I might be hoping for a little too much
It seems that since I first saw your picture
And looked in your eyes
I have been seeing you in all my dreams

I first saw you in a magazine
I wanna meet you
I wanna meet you
I wanna meet you
I'll be in love if you're as cute as you seem
I wanna meet you
I wanna meet you
I wanna meet you
I'll look you up where you want to be seen
I wanna meet you
I wanna meet you
I wanna meet you
