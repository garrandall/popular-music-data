Well, here I sit high, gettin' ideas
Ain't nothing but a fool would live like this
Out all night and runnin' wild
Woman sittin' home with a month old child

Dang me, dang me
They oughta take a rope and hang me
High from the highest tree
Woman, would you weep for me?

Just sittin' 'round drinkin' with the rest of the guys
Six rounds bought and I bought five
Spent the half the groceries and all the rent
Like fourteen dollars having twenty seven cents

Dang me, dang me
They oughta take a rope and hang me
High from the highest tree
Woman, would you weep for me?

I say roses are red and violets are purple
Sugar is sweet and so is maple surple
I was the seventh out of seven sons
My pappy was a pistol, I'm a son of a gun

I said, dang me, dang me
They oughta take a rope and hang me
High from the highest tree
Woman, would you weep for me?

Well, here I sit high, gettin' ideas
Ain't nothing but a fool would live like this
Out all night and runnin' wild
Woman sittin' home with a month old child

Dang me, dang me
They oughta take a rope and hang me
High from the highest tree
Woman, would you weep for me?
