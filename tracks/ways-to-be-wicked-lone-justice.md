Honey, why you always smile
When you see me hurt so bad?
Tell me what I did to you, babe
That would make you act like that?

Well, I've been your fool before, honey
Yeah, and I probably will again
'Cuz you ain't afraid to let me have it
No, you ain't afraid to stick it in

Well, you know so many
Ways to be wicked
Oh, but you don't know one little thing
About love

Well, I can take a little pain
Yeah, I can hold it pretty well
I can watch your little eyes light up
While you're walkin' me through Hell

Well, I've been your fool before, honey
Yeah, and I probably will again
'Cuz you ain't afraid to let me have it
No, you ain't afraid to stick it in

Well, you know so many
Ways to be wicked
But you don't know one little thing
About love

Those cobra eyes
Lie with a smile
Baby you take pride
In the devil down inside, yeah

Well, I can take a little pain
Yeah, I can hold it pretty well
I can watch your little eyes light up
While you're walkin' me through Hell

Well, I've been your fool before
Yeah, and I probably will again
You ain't afriad to let me have it
No, you ain't afraid to sitck it in

Well, you know so many
Ways to be wicked
Oh, but you don't know one little thing
About love

Well, you know so many
Ways to be wicked
Yeah, but you don't know one little, one little thing
About love

Yeah you know so many
Ways to be wicked
But you don't know one little, one little
