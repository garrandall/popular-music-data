Born Helena Jane
With a restless soul
She moved west to California
Became a centerfold

But once you change your name
Well the pieces fall
Now she hardly recognizes
Herself at all

And there's never any rain, when you want it
A hollow little game, and you've won it
Looking for a thrill, but you've done it all

So long, put your blue jeans back on girl
Go Home
Remember, Hollywood's Not America
So long, put your blue jeans back on girl
Go Home
Remember, Hollywood's Not America
O yea

And everybody here's from somewhere else
You could make a million dollars, but you might lose yourself
And you can take the heat will your heart go cold
They say acting's just pretending, even that gets old

And there's never any rain, when you want it
A hollow little game, and you've won it
Looking for a thrill but you've done it all

So long, put your blue jeans back on girl
Go home
Remember Hollywood's not America
So long put your blue jeans back on girl
Go home
Remember Hollywood's not America

And I know what you're doin'
I know that you
You can be anything you want to be

So long, put your blue jeans back on girl
Go home
Remember Hollywood's not America
So long put your blue jeans back on girl
Go home
Remember Hollywood's not America
Hollywood's not America
It's not America
