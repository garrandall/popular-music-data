Once I loved someone so deep
It hurt to leave his side
Cause he was the sun that shined for me
He gave me strength so I could see
Past the foolish game I could not abide


He was wonderful
Loveable
He was truly just so beautiful
I feel so blessed he came my way


Sugar sweet
My sugarhigh
The sweetest taste I`ll ever try
Your love is one I can`t deny
I love you, I love you, I love you

Sugar sweet
I`ve realized
Just one look into your eyes
Slowly gets me hypnotized
I love you, I love you, I love you


His love was far beyond wealth and gold
So much from one would I learn
He was a delicate morning rain
That fell to wash away my pain
And bring me warmth in return


He was magical
Mystical
Simply irresistible
This love I can`t convey

Oh, so wonderful, loveable
He was truly just so beautiful
I feel so blessed he came my way



Your love feels so amazing
Never thought I would have found you, baby
To hold you
Just to be near you
I love you, I love you, I love you

Sugar sweet, my sugar high
The sweetest taste I`ll ever try
Your love is one I can`t deny
I love you, I love you, I love you


He was magical, mystical
Simply irresistible
This love I can`t convey

Oh, so wonderful
Loveable
He was truly just so beautiful
(So beautiful)



Your love feels so amazing
Never thought I would have found you, baby
To hold you
Just to be near you
I love you, I love you, I love you
