In the Basement

Ohh, now tell me where can you party, child, all night long?
In the basement, down in the basement, yeah
Oh where can you go when your money gets low?
In the basement, whoa down in the basement
And if a storm is taking place, you can jam and still be safe
In the basement, down in the basement, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Where can you dance to any music you choose?
In the basement, whoa down in the basement
Oh, you got the comforts of home, a nightclub too
In the basement, whoa down in the basement
There's no cover charge or fee and the food and drinks are free
In the basement, down in the basement

Come on child, you can do it, you can do it, yeah

Guitar lead
In the basement, that's where it's at (4x)
In the basement, in the basement, in the basement
That's where its at

(You tell 'em)
Where they don't , where they don't check you age at the door
In the basement, whoa down in the basement
Barracuda and ??? 'til your feet get sore
In the basement, whoa down in the basement
Do any dance you want to do, there's no one under you
In the basement, I know it, you tell 'em oh-h-h-h I wanna go

In the basement, that's where it's at (4x)
Fade
