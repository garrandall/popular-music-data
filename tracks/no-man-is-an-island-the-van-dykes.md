No man is an island
No, no man is alone

Treat each man as your brother
And remember, each man's dream is your own

Now we need one another
And we all need to try to defend

Treat each man as your brother and each man as your friend

You can't live in this world all by yourself

No, no, no. You can't live alone

And just as sure as you try to make it by yourself, you're going to wake up and find you're going to need somebody else

No man is an island. No man is alone

Treat each man as your brother and remember that each man's dream -- is your own
