A lady came from Baltimore, all she wore was lace
She didn't know that I was poor, she never saw my place
I was there to steal her money, take her rings and run
Then I fell in love with the lady, got away with none

The lady's name was Susan Moore, her daddy read the law
She didn't know that I was poor and lived outside the law
Daddy said, I was a thief, didn't marry her for love
But I was Susan's true belief, I married her for love

I was there to steal her money, take her rings and run
Then I fell in love with the lady, got away with none

House she lived in had a wall to keep the robbers out
She never stopped to think at all, that's what I'm about
I was there to steal her money, to take her rings and run
Then I fell in love with the lady, got away with none
Then I fell in love with the lady, got away with none
