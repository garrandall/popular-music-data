So you finally came right out and said it girl
What took you so long
It was in your eyes, that look's been there for too long
I'm waiting in line
Would you say if I was wasting my time

Or did I miss again
I think I missed again oh

I think about it from time to time
When I'm lonely and on my own

I try to forget and yet, still rush to the telephone
I'm waiting in line
Would you say if I was wasting my time

Or did I miss again
I think I missed again oh
Or did I miss again
I think I missed again oh

Well it feels like something you want so bad
Then you think you've got it, but it's something you already had
You can feel it all around you, but it's something you just can't touch
And I feel it coming at me
I can feel it coming at me

Or did I miss again
I think I missed again oh
Or did I miss again
I think I missed again

I'm waiting in line, but would you say if I was wasting my time

Or did I miss again...
