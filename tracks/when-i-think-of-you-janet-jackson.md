Ooh, baby
Anytime my world gets crazy
All I have to do to calm it
Is just think of you


It's when I think of you, baby
Nothing else seems to matter
It's when I think of you, baby
All I think about is our love


I just get more attached to you
When you hold me in your arms
And squeeze me
And you leave me making me blue


It's when I think of you, baby
Nothing else seems to matter
It's when I think of you, baby
All I think about is our love


So in love
(So in love)
Ooh
(So in love)
With you
(So in love)
Baby
(So in love)
Ooh
(So in love)
Yeah
(So in love)
With you
(So in love)
(So in love)


When I think of you
(When I think of you)
When I think of you
(When I think of you)
Bass


I'm so in love
I just think of you
When you're not around, I
When I think of you


(So in love)
Ooh
(So in love)
So in love
(So in love)
With you
(So in love)
Baby, you
(So in love)
Ooh
(So in love)
So in love
(So in love)
With you
(So in love)


Break
Feels so good
When I think of you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
