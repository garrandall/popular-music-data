I'm walking proud
Got my head held high
I'm walking proud
And I'll tell you why
You're the prettiest girl
There ever could be
And I'm walking proud
Cause you're walking with me

Well everybody told me
Our love couldnt last
They said, Shell never be true
To a loser like you
She's out of your class

But I'm walking proud
Chorus

So many other guys
Tried to steal you away
But when they came around
Your heart stood it's ground
And that's why I say

I'm walking proud
Chorus
