If I don't say this now, I will surely break
As I'm leaving the one I wanna take
Forgive the urgency, but hurry up and wait
My heart has started to separate


Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
I'll look after you


There now, steady love, so few come and don't go
Will you, won't you be the one I'll always know?
When I'm losing my control, the city spins around
You're the only one who knows, you slow it down


Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
I'll look after you
And I'll look after you


If ever there was a doubt
My love, she leans into me
This most assuredly counts
She says most assuredly


Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
I'll look after you
After you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
Oh, oh, oh


It's always have and never hold
You've begun to feel like home
What's mine is yours to leave or take
What's mine is yours to make your own


Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
Oh, oh, oh
