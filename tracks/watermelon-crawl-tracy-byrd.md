I was drivin' through Georgia in late July
On a day hot enough to make the devil sigh
I saw a homemade sign written in red
Rhine county watermelon festival ahead

Well, I wasn't in a hurry so I slowed down
Took a two lane road to a one horse town
There was a party goin' on when I got there
I heard a welcome speech from a small town mayor

He said we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine
Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
Help yourself to some, but obey the law
If you drink, don't drive, do the watermelon crawl

When the band started playin' the watermelon queen
Said let me show you somethin' that you ain't ever seen
She grabbed me by the arm, said come on lets go
She dipped down, spun around, and do-ce-doed

She rocked back on her heels dropped down to her knees
Crawled across the floor and she jumped back on her feet
She wiggled and she giggled and be all you ever saw
Said this is how you do the watermelon crawl

She said we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine
Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
Help yourself to some, but obey the law
If you drink, don't drive, do the watermelon crawl

If you're ever down in Georgia around about July
If you ain't in a hurry then you oughta stop by
I can guarantee that you're goin' have a ball
Learnin' how to do the watermelon crawl

Well, we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine
Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
Help yourself to some, but obey the law
If you drink, don't drive, do the watermelon crawl

Yeah do the watermelon crawl
Have fun you all
And do the watermelon crawl
