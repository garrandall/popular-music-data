I used to be the one who made you feel
So safe and strong
I could always make it right
When everything was going wrong
I don't know why it seems
So different now
I'm on my own
And I don't know what it is
That scares me when I'm all alone
I can't believe that everyone I know
Would lie to me
When they all tell me that I'm not the man
I used to be
Don't want to hear about the things
That I already know
You've got to say it isn't so
Oh no, it's the...


The ghost of you that gets me every time
Just won't let go until it brings me down
I try to hide it but there's only one
My obsession is you

Yeah, my friends all turn away
They tell me not to waste my time
They say they just don't understand
How anyone could be so blind
And there's one thing you can't change
Forget about her now you know she's gone
Hey boy, that girl is just no good
She's only gonna do you harm

So I watch the hours turn
Until I lose the last lony roy of light
And I know I can't pretend
Those shadows won't come out tonight
