Co-Co would dream of dancing
At midnight beneath the stars
'Cause when it comes to dancing
Co-Co's a star!
He danced in a ring of fire
That circled the island shore
And as the flames got higher
They'd all call for more and more

Ho-chi-ka-ka-ho Co-Co
Ho-chi-ka-ka-ho Co-Co
Ho-chika-ka-ho go go Co-Co

Ho-chi-ka-ka-ho Co-Co
Ho-chi-ka-ka-ho Co-Co
Ho-chi-ka-ka-ho go go Co-Co

Across the silver water
The sound of the island drums
Echoing Co-Co's laughter
Yeah, Co-Co's the one
He moves with the cool of moonlight
Under a tropic sky
Then into the morning sunlight
He'd still hear them cry and cry

Ho-chi-ka-ka-ho Co-Co
Ho-chi-ka-ka-ho Co-Co
Ho-chika-ka-ho go go Co-Co

Ho-chi-ka-ka-ho Co-Co
Ho-chi-ka-ka-ho Co-Co
Ho-chi-ka-ka-ho go go Co-Co

Ho-chi-ka-ka-ho Co-Co
Ho-chi-ka-ka-ho Co-Co
Ho-chi-ka-ka-ho go go Co-Co...
