You've been singing, that same old song
Far too long, far too long
Say you'll buy me a shiny ring
But your words don't mean a thing
No more calling me baby
No more loving like crazy


Til' you take me down (take me down)
You better take me down (take me down)
Take me down to the little white church
Take me down (take me down)
Take me down (take me down)
Take me down to the little white church
Take me down...

You can't ride this gravy train
Anymore, anyway
There's a price for keeping me
I might be cheap, but I ain't free
No more calling me baby
No more loving like crazy


Come on!

Charming devil, silver tongue
Had your fun, now you're done
Mama warned me 'bout your games
She don't like you anyways

No more calling me baby
No more loving like crazy
No more chicken and gravy
I ain't gonna have your baby!



Take me down to the little white church, take me down
Take me down, take me down to the little white church
Take me down, take me down, take me down, take me down to the little white church
Take me down to the little white church, take me down to the little white church
