Once in every life... someone comes along,
And you came to me... it was almost like a song.

You were in my heart... right where you belong,
And we were so in love... it was almost like a song.

January through December... we had such a perfect year,
Then the flames became a dying ember...
All at once you weren't here.

Now my broken heart... cries for you each night,
And it's almost like a song... but it's much too sad to write.

Now my broken heart... cries for you each night,
And it's almost like a song... but it's much to sad to write...
Much too sad to write.
