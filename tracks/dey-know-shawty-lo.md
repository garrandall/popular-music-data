Hey
Get ready to show love man
Shawty Lo man
Sing it and ring it to a brother
Free of charge
Hey

L O, L O, Dey Know, Dey Know 

Shawty Lo I got Flavor
Let's you know the kid got paper
like 40 don't save her
Bankhead then pull a caper
The way you drop would have thought I had a tazer
Call me street, like a razor
Shawty Lo, ATL, I'm the Mayor
Street niggas but my gear be tailor
Every now and then shawty might rock gators
Me and that puss I got acres
yeah no more nosey ass neighbors
big ups to all my haters


L O, L O, Dey Know, Dey Know 

(Shawty Lo Man hey, hey)
I'm the man and they know that
I got cash, I'm talking throw back
100 grand

I hit club and i blow that
All these hoes know Lo that
I'm picture perfect, made for Kodak
Let's talk money, I got plenty
Dope boys let's get, get ,get it


L O, L O, Dey Know, Dey Know 

L O, L O, Dey Know, Dey Know 

Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, How you doing it's L O
Said you see three I'm the one middle
I don't need this beat, i could rock it acapello
I want my juice, all i needed was some skittles
Yea now I'm King, yes sir just like G
A-Town fitted who but me
L O, she know, he know, they know, they know, I am
