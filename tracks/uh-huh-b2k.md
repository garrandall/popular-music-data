Ain't no more need for you and me to creep
I want you so bad I dont care who sees 
so girl hold on I got what you want 
I know you aint scared to go have some fun 
so let your girls know that you found someone 
who be keepin you tight and crunk 

I'm the guy in your dreams

we can walk through the mall while i hold ya hips 
or you can hang out the drop while im pushin the whip 
take you on a ride that you'll never forget 
runnin home tellin ya friends lil fizz is it 
got ya hooked by the way that I lick my lips 
and I got many dimes i aint sweatin a chick 
yo I run these girls from coast to coast 
droppin game so sick I got em doin the most 

I know that you wantin this 
tell me can you handle it 
show me how you work dem hips 
and maybe you can roll with it 
I know that you wantin this 
tell me can you handle it 
show me how you work dem hips 
and maybe you can roll with it 

I know that you wantin this (uh huh) 
tell me can you handle it (uh huh) 
show me how you work dem hips (uh huh) 
and maybe you can roll with it (uh huh) 
I know that you wantin this (uh huh) 
tell me can you handle it (uh huh) 
show me how you work dem hips (uh huh) 
and maybe you can roll with it (uh huh)
