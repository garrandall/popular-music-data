The Human Race is runnin' over me
I punch a clock at 9 and 5
Just tryin' to make a livin'
A plastic face on satellite TV
Says, "Life is filled with give and take"
He's takin' and I'm givin
So I dance


It's my system of survival (SOS)
I'm dancin'
System of survival (SOS)
It's a system of survival
Future revival
Greet the new arrival


At times it's the only way
I'm gonna make it through this day


Everybody get up
Do your dance
Keep survivin'
Everybody get up
Do your dance
Stay alive

A city night
I walk a street in fear
While politicians brag about
A paperwork solution

Another life
I shed another tear
I'm waiting for somebody new
To lead the revolution
So I dance



It's my system of survival...



(SOS) Send it out
Send it out, send it out, send it out...
