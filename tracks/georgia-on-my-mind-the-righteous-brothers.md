Georgia, hey Georgia
No peace I find
It's just a song, sweet song
God, it keeps Georgia on my mind, on my mind

And Georgia, well Georgia
A song, this is a song of you
And it comes as sweet and clear
Just like the moonlight comin' down, down, down through the pines

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes, they smile so tenderly
But still in peaceful, peaceful dreams I see
That the road, road leads back to you

And Georgia, hey sweet Georgia
The whole day through
Comes as sweet and clear
Just like the moonlight comin' down
Comin' down, down, down, down through the pines

Other arms, they keep reachin' out to me
Other eyes, they smile so tenderly
But still in peaceful, peaceful dreams I see
That the road, road leads back to you

Lovin' Georgia, love Georgia
No peace, no peace I find
It's just a song, sweet song
Lovin' keeps Georgia on my mind

Keeps you jolted, right here on my mind
Hey, on my mind
Keeps you jolted, right here on my mind
