I canâ??t tell ya baby what went wrong
I canâ??t make you feel what you felt so long ago
Iâ??ll let it show
I canâ??t give you back whatâ??s been hurt
Heartaches come and go and all thatâ??s left are the words
I canâ??t let go
If we take some time to think it over baby
Take some time, let me know
If you really want to go

Donâ??t know what you got till itâ??s gone
Donâ??t know what it is I did so wrong
Now I know what I got
Itâ??s just this song
And it ainâ??t easy to get back
Takes so long

I canâ??t feel the things that cause you pain
I canâ??t clear my heart of your love it falls like rain
Ainâ??t the same
I hear you calling far away
Tearing through my soul I just canâ??t take another day
Whoâ??s to blame
If we take some time to think it over baby
Take some time let me know
If you really want to go

Donâ??t know what you got 'till itâ??s gone
Donâ??t know what it is I did so wrong
Now I know what I got
Itâ??s just this song
And it ainâ??t easy to get back
Takes so long

Do you want to see me begginâ?? baby
Canâ??t you give me just one more day
Canâ??t you see my heartâ??s been dragginâ?? lately
Iâ??ve been lookinâ?? for the words to say

Donâ??t know what you got 'till itâ??s gone
Donâ??t know what it is I did so wrong
Now I know what I got
Itâ??s just this song
And it ainâ??t easy to get back
Takes so long

Donâ??t know what you got 'till itâ??s gone no
Donâ??t know what it is I did so wrong
Now I know what I got
Itâ??s just this song
And it ainâ??t easy to get back
Takes so long
