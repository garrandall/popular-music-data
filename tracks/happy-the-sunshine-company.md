Happiness is when
I'm near you
To share your smile
If I love to

Happy's the day I found you
Happy's the world around you

I'll never cry as long as
We're together
My happiness is you

Happy's the way I love you
Happy's just thinking of you
I've found a lifetime of pleasure
A hidden treasure
In the happiness of you

You're the girl
I wanna marry
You're the girl that makes me
That makes me happy

Happy's our life together
Happy's our love forever
What more in life
Could you give me?

Happy is the day
All my life with you
Happiness is when I'm near you
To share your smile
If I love to

Happy's the day I found you
Happy's the world around you
Happy's the way I love you
Happy's just thinking of you
Happy's our life together
