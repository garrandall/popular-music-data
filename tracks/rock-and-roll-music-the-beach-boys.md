Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me


I have no kicks against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darned fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until it sounds just like a symphony

I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she could hear my man wailing sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane

Way down south they gave a jubilee
I tell you folks they had a jamboree
And drinking beer from a wooden cup
The folks dancing got all shook up



[Outro
Say, if you want to dance with me
It's got to be some of that
If you wanna dance with me
