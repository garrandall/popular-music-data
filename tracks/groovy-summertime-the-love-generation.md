It's a groovy day
You're groovy girl
Throw your cares away
It's a groovy world
So come on (come on)
So come on

It's a groovy summertime
And the sun is out
(And the sun is out)
Do I have to tell you girl
What it's all about
(What it's all about)

Sky is blue above us
On the hill the grass is green
Everywhere you turn
It's a lovin' scene
Do you know what I mean?

It's a groovy summertime
And you're groovy too
Got a lot of good times
I wanna spend with you
We'll have fun together
Just walkin' hand in hand
Yeah, we'll have fun together
Baby and
I wanna be your man

It's a groovy day
You're groovy girl
Throw your cares away
It's a groovy world
So come on (come on)
So come on

It's a groovy summertime
And the sun is out
(And the sun is out)
Do I have to tell you girl
What it's all about
(What it's all about)

Sky is blue above us
On the hill the grass is green
Everywhere you turn
It's a lovin' scene
Do you know what I mean?
