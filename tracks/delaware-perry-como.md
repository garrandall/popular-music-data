Oh, what did Delaware boy what did Delaware?
What did Delaware boy, what did Delaware?
She wore a brand New Jersey, she wore a brand New Jersey
She wore a brand New Jersey, that's what she did wear

Oh, why did California, why did Californ?
Why did California, was she all alone?
She called to say Hawaii, she called to say How are ya
She called to say how are ya, that's why she did phone

Oh, what did Mississip boy, what did Missi sip?
What did Missi sip boy, through her pretty lips
She sipped a Minnesota, she sipped a mini soda
She sipped a mini soda, that's what she did sip

Oh, where has Oregon boy, where as Ora gone?
If you want Alaska, I'll ask her where she's gone
She went to pay her Texas, she went to pay her taxes
She went to pay her Taxes, that's where she has gone

Oh, how did Wisconsin boy, she stole a NeBras-ky
Too bad that Arkan-sas boy, and so did Tenne-see
It made poor Flora-di, it made poor Flora-di you see
She died in Missouri boy, she died in Misery

Oh, what did Delaware, boy what did Delaware
What did Delaware boy, what did Delaware
