Calling the world from isolation
'Cause right now, that's the ball where we be chained
And if you're coming back to find me
You'd better have good aim
Shoot it true, I need you in the picture
That's why I'm calling you

I'm the lonely twin, the left hand
Reset myself and get back on track
I don't want this isolation
See the state of me now

Calling the hunter with the rifle
'Cause right now, that's the ball where we be chained
Shoot it true, I want you in the picture
That's why I'm calling you

I'm the lonely twin, the left hand
Reset myself and get back on track
I don't want this isolation
See the state I'm in now

If I pick it up when I know that it's broken
Do I put it back?
Or do I head out onto the lonesome trail
And let you down?

I'm the lonely twin, the left hand
(If I pick it up when I know that it's broken
Do I put it back?)
I don't want this isolation
(Or do I head out onto the lonesome trail)
See the state I'm in now
(And let you down?)

If I pick it up when I know that it's broken
Do I put it back?
Or do I head out onto the lonesome trail
And let you down?
