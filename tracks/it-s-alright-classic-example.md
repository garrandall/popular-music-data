It's a new beginning
Let's start again together
You and I
For the time has passed
My love for you will never, ever die

It's been so hard
To tell you how I feel
But I want you to know
That my love's for real

And it's alright (alright)
(It's gonna be alright, alright)
(Alright, it's gonna be alright)
(Alright)

But it's been so hard
And I promise
We can make a brand new start, baby
Now the time has changed
My love for you will remain the same

It's been so hard
To tell you how I feel
But I want you to know
That my love's for real

And it's alright (alright)
(It's gonna be alright, alright)
(Alright, it's gonna be alright)
(Alright) yeah, yeah

Alright
It's gonna be alright
Alright
It's gonna be alright
Alright
It's gonna be alright
Alright
It's gonna be alright
Alright

Won't you sing it, TJ?

It's been so hard
To tell you how I feel
But I want you to know
That my love's for real, baby

Alright (alright)
(It's gonna be alright, alright)
(Alright, it's gonna be alright)
(Alright)

Alright
It's alright tonight
It's alright, oh
Alright, alright

Take me to the church

Alright
It's gonna be alright
Alright
It's gonna be alright
Alright
It's gonna be alright
Alright
It's gonna be alright
