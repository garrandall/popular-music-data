He's looking over my shoulder
Though I'm with you tonight
He knows that he'll have you tomorrow
And you'll be holding him tight

I can't explain what she does to me
Nobody knows what she does to me
Too bad that she does the same to you
I can't forget what she does to me
Nobody does what she does to me
Too bad that she does the same to you

You're driving me crazy
You show affection for him
You tell him all of my secrets
I don't think I can win

I want you Diana
He wants you Diana
We want you Diana
Who gets you Diana
