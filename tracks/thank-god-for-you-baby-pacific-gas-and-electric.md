Thank god for you baby
Thank god for you baby

Sometimes
Early in the morning
Just about the time
The day is dawning
Oh I look at you
Lying next to me (next to me)
I just have to thank
The powers that be

And I
Thank god for you baby
Thank god for you baby

Cause you showed (showed)
You're an angel (angel)
To me

My baby

Listen

I know I hurt you
In times gone by (gone by)
But you stood by me baby
Not a tear did you cry
Now I'm touching you
And you're smile at me
And we shine like the beacon
For all the world to see

Thank god for you baby
Thank god for you baby
Cause you showed (showed)
You're an angel (angel)
To me

You're my angel baby (angel)
Everybody knows it (angel)

Thank god for you baby
Thank god for you baby
Cause you showed (showed)
You're an angel (angel)
To me

Don't you know
You're my angel

(Thank god)

Yes you're my angel baby (thank god for you baby)
And I (thank god)
Don't you know I thank god every day (thank god for you baby)
For sending you to me baby (thank god)
Oh girl (thank god for you baby)
And sometimes in the morning (thank god)
You know in the afternoon lord (thank god for you baby)
Or all over the night (thank god)
I'm down on my knees (thank god for you baby)
And I just gotta keep right on thanking him (thank god)
Oh baby (thank god for you baby)
You're my angel (you're my angel)
Oh, you're my angel (angel)
And I thank god for you (you're my angel)
I thank god for you baby (angel)
Heaven must of sent you (you're my angel)
I don't care what nobody has to say (angel)
You're my angel (you're my angel)
And when I touch you (angel)

I love you (angel)
Thank god for you (you're my angel)
Keep on thanking (angel)

Every day (angel)
(you're my angel)
