I see the sunrise creeping in
Everything changes like the desert wind
Here she comes and then sheâs gone again


Iâm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heartâs behind the pocket of my shirt
Iâll just keep rolling till Iâm in the dirt
âCause Iâm a traveller, oh, Iâm a traveller
I couldnât tell you honey, I donât know
Where Iâm going but Iâve got to go
âCause every turn reveals some other road
And Iâm a traveller, oh, Iâm a traveller

My heartbeatâs rhythm is a lonesome sound
Just like the rubber turning on the ground
Always lost and nowhere bound



When Iâm gone
Somebody else will have to feel this wrong
Somebody else will have to sing this song
Somebody else will have to sing along
Sing along
