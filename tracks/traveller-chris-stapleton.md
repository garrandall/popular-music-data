I see the sunrise creepin' in
Everything changes like the desert wind
Here she comes and then she's gone again, and


I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you, honey, I don't know
Where I'm goin', but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller


My heartbeat's rhythm is a lonesome sound
Just like the rubber turnin' on the ground
Always lost and nowhere bound


I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you, honey, I don't know
Where I'm goin', but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller


When I'm gone
Somebody else will have to feel this wrong
Somebody else will have to sing this song
Somebody else will have to sing along
Sing along


I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you, honey, I don't know
Where I'm goin', but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
