Love is where you find it

When you find no love at home

And there's nothing cold as ashes
After the fire is gone


The bottle is almost empty
The clock just now struck ten
And darling I had to call you
To our favorite place again



We know it's wrong for us to meet
But the fire's gone out at home

And there's nothing cold as ashes
After the fire is gone



Love is where you find it

When you find no love at home

And there's nothing cold as ashes
After the fire is gone


Your lips are warm and tender
Your arms hold me just right
Sweet words of love you remember
That the one at home forgot



Each time we say is the last time
But we keep hanging on

And there's nothing cold as ashes
After the fire is gone



Love is where you find it

When you find no love at home

And there's nothing cold as ashes
After the fire is gone
