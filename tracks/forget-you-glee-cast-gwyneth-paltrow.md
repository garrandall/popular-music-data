I see you driving 'round town
With the guy I love and I'm like, 
Forget you! 
Oo, oo, ooo
I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough and I'm like, 
Forget you! 
And forget him too! 
Said, if I was richer, 
I'd still be with ya
Ha, now ain't that some shhh? 
(ain't that some shhh?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best with a... 
Forget you! 
Oo, oo, ooo

Yeah I'm sorry, 
I can't afford a ferrari, 
But that don't mean 
I can't get you there.
I guess she's an xbox 
and I'm more atari, 
But the way you play 
your game ain't fair.

I pity the fool that 
falls in love with you
(Oh she's a gold digger)
Well
(Just thought you should know)
Ooooooh
I've got some news for you
Yeah go run and tell 
your little girlfriend

I see you driving 'round town
With the guy I love and I'm like, 
Forget you! 
Oo, oo, ooo
I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough and I'm like, 
Forget you! 
And forget him too! 
Said, if I was richer, 
I'd still be with ya
Now ain't that some shhh? 
(ain't that some shhh?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best with a... 
Forget you! 
Oo, oo, ooo

Now I know, that I had to borrow, 
Beg and steal and lie and cheat.
Trying to keep ya, 
trying to please ya.
'Cause being in love 
with your face ain't cheap.

I pity the fool that 
falls in love with you
(Oh she's a gold digger)
Well
(Just thought you should know)
Ooooooh
I've got some news for you
I really hate you right now

I see you driving 'round town
With the guy I love and I'm like, 
Forget you! 
Oo, oo, ooo
I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough and I'm like, 
Forget you! 
And forget him too! 
Said, if I was richer, 
I'd still be with ya
Ha, now ain't that some shhh? 
(ain't that some shhh?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best with a... 
Forget you! 
Oo, oo, ooo

Now baby, baby, baby,
why'd you wanna wanna hurt me so bad?
(So bad, so bad, so bad)
I tried to tell my 
mamma but she told me
"this is one for your dad"
(Your dad, your dad, your dad)
Uh! Whhhy? Uh! Whhhy? Uh! 
Whhhy baby? Oh! I love you! 
I still do. Oooh! 

I see you driving 'round town
With the guy I love and I'm like, 
Forget you! 
Oo, oo, ooo
I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough and I'm like, 
Forget you! 
And forget him too! 
Said, if I was richer, 
I'd still be with ya
Ha, now ain't that some shhh? 
(ain't that some shhh?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best with a... 
Forget you! 
Oo, oo, ooo
