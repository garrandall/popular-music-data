This is it
This is what I've waited for so long
Starting now 
Gotta trust these feelings comin' on
Take a chance
Even though I feel like I should run

I'm stayin' with it 
Let my heart take me there
Got a feeling 
Ooh I'm going somewhere
I'm deep in it 
And I really do care
Wait a minute now 
Boy don't walk out now

I can see
I can see you're disbelieving eyes
Don't you know 
Holding back your love is so unwise
Take a chance 
Ain't it time you took a lover's stand

I'm stayin' with it 
Let my heart take me there
Got a feeling 
Ooh I'm going somewhere
I'm deep in it 
And I really do care
Wait a minute now 
Boy don't walk out now

I'm stayin' with it 
Let my heart take me there
Got a feeling 
Ooh I'm going somewhere
I'm deep in it 
And I really do care
Wait a minute now 
Boy don't walk out now

I'm stayin' with it 
Let my heart take me there
Got a feeling 
Ooh I'm going somewhere
I'm deep in it 
And I really do care
Wait a minute now 
Boy don't walk out now

Stayin' with it 
Ooh stayin' with it
Stayin' with it
Ooh, hoo, hoo, yea
Stayin' with it
Don't hold back 'cause you gotta take a chance with me
