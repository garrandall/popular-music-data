Here I am again, mama
I'm knockin' on your door
So let me in, I swear I won't be
The way I was before
And don't you know that
I've been thinking about what you told me
Rolling it over in my mind
And much to my surprise I find

That you were absolutely right
You've been right all along
You're absolutely right and I was wrong

Second time around should be easy
Break down the walls between me and you
So we can see completely
How easy love can be
I know it was you who said it would be me
That'd come crawling back to you upon my knees

And you were absolutely right
You've been right all along
You're absolutely right and I'm wrong

Ah, I wish that you could see
Ah, how bad I want to be
Ah, the kind of man to who you'd give your key

If you'd let me in again
The room, come supper time
We'll be sitting by the fire this evening
Drinking homemade wine
And we can laugh and dance and sing
And play the lovely night away

'Cause you were absolutely right
You've been right all along
You're absolutely right and I'm wrong

You were absolutely right
You've been right all along
You're absolutely right and I'm wrong
I'm wrong
I'm wrong
