When you walk my way
I feel the rush come over me
A sharp panic panic
It's the things you say
That makes a rush come over me
It happens all the time

I never was too good at following rules nah, nah
I'm better just pretending I was a fool

All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
And I'm falling for you
Keep cool, stay tough
But that's never enough
And these are the lessons in love

All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
And I'm falling for you
Keep cool, stay young
I'm just having my fun
With the lessons in love

If I walk away
I feel the push inside of me
That won't let me leave
But what could I say
To make you feel what's inside of me
This happens all the time

I never was too good at following rules nah, nah
I'm better just pretending I was the fool
Get me out

All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
And I'm falling for you
Keep cool, stay tough
But that's never enough
And these are the lessons in love

All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
And I'm falling for you
Keep cool, stay young
I'm just having my fun
With the lessons in love

All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
All day, all night
I got the lights in my eyes
