How many teardrops
Have I cried over you
A million and one tears
A million and two

How many long nights
Have my arms ached for you
A million and one nights
A million and two

Loving you, darling
While I thought
You loved me, only me
But you were just fooling
And the fool you
Were fooling was me

How many sweet dreams
Will never come true
A million and one dreams
A million and two

Loving you, darling
While I thought
You loved me, only me
But you were just fooling
And the fool you
Were fooling was me

How many sweet dreams
Will never come true
A million and one dreams
A million and two
