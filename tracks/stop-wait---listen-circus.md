Oh shit! Never. Niggas talkin bout I fell off. What? You can't be serious. So I'm about to jump in my bag, just in case you niggas forgot how I give you music.


I was a kid hustlin, ribs touchin, grindin for grub
Three wings will hurt you when I'm in the hub
And a hand in the drugs, with my hand on the snub
Cause man, I'm a thug. Is you a man or a bug?
I'm back in that damn bar with my hand in the glove
On my crystal, I give a half gram for a dub
I'm workin now, got the sour kush and the purple now
I got it if you try and cop it, you ain't gotta search around
I purchase pounds and flirt around with that white chick
That white shit'll have your nose red like a circus clown
If I ain't layin verses down then I'm on the strip
I got that work flippin like some bitches in the circus now
It's like the universe and soul when our work is over
And I've got them Roxies and Percs if you try and purchase those
Thirsty hoes poppin pills like it's birth control
500 milligrams, I'm a drug dealer man
You gotta play your cards right but if you deal a hand
You could make a killin man and blow like a ceiling fan
Listen, sippin liquor's a good feelin man
I was a cognac cat, now I'm a tequila man
I'm wrapping grammes up in my son's Silly Bandz
And my pinky ring cost about a half a kilogram
I was on some livin in mama house shit
Now I'm in Neiman's, spending mortgage money on an outfit
I clean my jewels with the shit you clean your mouth with
Either Crest or Colgate, success is my soul mate
You so fake, I'm the truth, not a pretender
I've got one liners niggas with Alzheimers remember
And I can fight but even a ninja could get ingureesd
So I keep the hammer on me like Thor from The Avengers
I'm like a superhero, you's a weirdo
So I get you robbed like De Niro
When you say you hustle birds, that get on my fuckin nerves
Cause you ain't never fucked with them birds, you like a scarecrow
My weed green but got orange hairs though
And it's real strong like that man Samson when his hair grow
I put in years yo, years ago
You could barely flow, so prepare for your burial
You hear me yo? Cause I'm the illest alive
You want my title? Then you must be suicidal, nigga willin to die
I'm still on my job, I ain't retired nigga, I'm fire, nigga
You say you hot, the stop singin to the choir nigga
I'll still eat you up, I ain't on a diet nigga
You could get your ass chewed quick like fast food
The last dude that tried to body Cass
Got every bone in his body smashed and thrown in a body cast
I kick somebody ass like karate class
Be cash, jumpin in his Jet Li bag
If you owe me cash, I'm grabbin a ski mask
And the Glock, you in hot water like a tea bag
I don't need a G pass, I go where I wanna go
Cause I could rumble yo, and niggas know my gun would blow
I'm undefeated, fightin murder cases, I wanna know
It was a setback but you gotta respect that
Before I took 10 steps forward, I had to step back
If you doubt that I'm a step up you've got me F-ed up
I'm still regretin all the chicken that I messed up
But still start spendin the chicken soon as the check cut
I'm dressed up, snap back and a fresh cut
Guess what, my flow so sick I should go get checked up
Cause I'm real ill, feel where I'm comin from?
I'm in an Escalade, rims taller than my youngest son
I just bought another gun
If you talk stupid, I'm a start to shoot it
And I put that on my other son
I'm not pressed to catch another case
But, you a son of a bitch and I say it to your mother face
But the bull rhymes got the best lines
But this next line is an oxymoron, niggas love to hate.
Feel me nigga? I'm from Philly, nigga
Still reppin my city, nigga. I just hustle in another state.
You motherfuckers fake, I can't fuckin wait
To see you, confront you, then punch you in the fuckin face


I mean... there's a big difference between what they do and what we do. (Mayhem Music!) (Damn that shit was dope!)
