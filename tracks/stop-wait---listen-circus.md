I've been trying everything I know
But you still, you still don't say no
All the clouds, they're turning gray
Hey, girl, here's what I have to say


I say stop, what are you looking for
I say wait, it's still not too late
I say listen to what I have to say

I've been looking
For someone just like you
Hey, girl, you been such a fool
Little girl, why must you be so cruel
I really don't know what to do



I've been looking
For someone just like you
Hey, girl, you been such a fool
Little girl, why must you be so cruel
I really don't know what to do



Stop, stop, stop, stop
