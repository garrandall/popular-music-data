Huh!
What you sippin' on that got you talking crazy?
Lookin' at me sideways, always coming at me
Why you, why you acting hard when you just a baby?
Boy, I keep it real with you, but you trying to play me

Have you lost your mind?
Open up your eyes
Huh!

(Someone else) There ain't no excuses, excuses, babe
(Someone else) Cause your mama raised you better than that, huh!

What you sippin' on that got you talking crazy?

Open up your eyes
Huh!

Your mama raised you better than, better than that
There ain't no excuses, excuses, babe
Cause your mama raised you better than that, huh! (she raised you better than that)
