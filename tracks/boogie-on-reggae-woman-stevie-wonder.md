I like to see you boogie
Right across the floor
I like to do it to you
Till you holla for more

I like to reggae
But you dance too fast for me
I'd like to make love to you
So you can make me scream

Boogie on reggae woman
What is wrong with me
Boogie on reggae woman
Baby can't you see

I'd like to see both of us
Fall deeply in love
I'd like to see you na
Under the stars above
Yes I would

I'd like to see both of us
Fall deeply in love - yeah
I'd like to see you in the raw
Under the stars above

So boogie on reggae woman
What is wrong with you
Boogie on reggae woman
What you tryin' to do

Can I play? Can I play?
No!

Boogie on reggae woman
What is wrong with me
Boogie on reggae woman
What you tryin' to do

Boogie on reggae woman
Let me do it to you
Boogie on reggae woman
What you tryin' to do
