I would walk out on my friends to get to you
If I lose them all for your love I'll do that to
Guess they mean well when they tell me what to do
But they don't know how far I'll go to get to you

Burnin bridges behind me to get to you
Breaking all ties that bind me to get to you
I hold your love far above what I go through
I would give all I own for a steppin stone
Just to get to you

If its the last thing I do I'll get to you
Just because I know just how much you want me to
You're the only thing that can bring my world in view
Every breath I take every move I make
Is to get to you

Burnin bridges behind me to get to you
Breakin all ties that bind me to get to you
I hold your love far above what I go through
I would give all I own for a steppin stone
Just to get to you
