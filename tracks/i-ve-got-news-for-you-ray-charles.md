You said before me met
That your life was awful tame
Well, I took you to a night club
And the whole band knew your name Oh
Well, baby, baby, baby


I've Got News For You
Oh, somehow your story don't ring true
Well, I've got news for you


Well, you phoned me you'd be late
Cause you took the wrong express
And then you walked in smiling
With your lipstick all a mess
Oh, let me say to you little mama


Wo, I've Got News for you
Ah, your story don't ring true lil girl
Yeah, I've got news for you


Oh, you wore a diamond watch
Claimed it was from Uncle Joe
When I looked at the inscription
It said love from Daddy-O
Oh, well baby, wo lil girl, I wanna say


I've Got News For You
Ah, if you think that jive will do
Let me tell you, oh


I've Got News For You
Well, somehow your story don't ring true
Wo, I've Got News For You
