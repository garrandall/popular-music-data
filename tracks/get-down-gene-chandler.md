Real real gone
I got hit by a bow and arrow
Got me down to the very marrow
And I'm real real gone

Real real gone
I can't stand up by myself
Don't you know I need your help
And I'm real real gone

Some people say
You can make it on your own
Oh you can make it if you try
I know better now
You can't stand up alone
Oh baby that is why

I'm real real gone
I can't stand up by myself
Don't you know I need your help
You're a friend of mine
And I'm real real gone

And Sam Cooke is on the radio
And the night is filled with space
And your fingertips touch my face
You're a friend of mine
And I'm real real gone

I'm real gone
Oh lord I got hit by a bow and arrow
Got me down to the very marrow
You're a friend of mine
And I'm real real gone
And I'm real real gone
I'm real gone
