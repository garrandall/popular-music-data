(Jimmy Dean - Ruth Roberts)

The first thing every morning
And the last thing every night
I think of you and all the things I say and do
If only you were here to whisper sweet things to.

I tell you how much I love you
How I'm longing to hold you tight
The first thing every morning
And the last thing every night.

Oh, I tell you how much I love you
How I'm longing to hold you tight
The first thing every morning
And the last thing every night.

The very first thing every morning
And the last thing every night...
