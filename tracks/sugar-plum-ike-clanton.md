I haven't got a job
'Cos they say they couldn't use no freaks
I want a position at the top
No training and a two day week
Won't you take me
To the land of flood and hunger
Won't you lead me
To the streets of dust and death

Let it rain on me
Let it shine on you
Let the sun shine through
Sugar plum

I haven't got a car
'Cos I never earned enough
To pay the price of fuel
Now I'm playin' my guitar
'Cos you understand that
I got the blues
Won't you take me
To the land of flood and hunger
Won't you lead me
To the streets of dust and death

Let it rain on me
Let it shine on you
Let the sun shine through
Sugar plum

Now I'm walking through the street
And I haven't eaten nothin'
For a week or two
I imagine that my belly's gonna swell
'Til I can't see my shoes
Won't you take me
To the land of flood and hunger
Won't you lead me
To the streets of dust and death

Let it rain on me
Let it shine on you
Let the sun shine through
Sugar plum
