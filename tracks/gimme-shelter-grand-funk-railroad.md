Oooo, oo, oo.
Oooo, oo, oo.

Oooo, a storm is threatenin', my very life today.
If I don't get some shelter, oh, I'm gonna' fade away.


War children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away.
War children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away.

Oooo, see the fire sweeping, up every street today.
Burns like a red-coal carpet, mad bull lost it's way.



Rape, murder, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away.
Rape, murder, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away.
Rape, murder, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away.

Oooo, a storm is threatenin', my very life today.
If I don't get some shelter, oh, I'm gonna' fade away.

War children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away.
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away.

I said a love sister, it's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away.
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away, kiss away, kiss away.





Love sister, it's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away.
Love sister, it's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away.
War children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away.
Love sister, it's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away.
War children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away.
Love sister, it's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away.
