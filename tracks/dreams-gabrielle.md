They can come true, yeah
They can come true


Move a step closer you know that I want you
I can tell by your eyes that you want me too
Just a question of time I knew we'd be together
And that you'd be mine I want you here forever


Do you hear what I'm saying?
Gotta say how I feel
I can't believe you're here
But I know that you're real
I know what I want and baby, it's you
I can't deny my feelings because they are true


Dreams can come true
Look at me, babe, I'm with you
You know you gotta have hope
You know you gotta be strong
Dreams can come true
Look at me, babe, I'm with you
You know you gotta have hope
You know you gotta be strong


I've seen you sometimes on your own and in crowds
I knew I had to have you my hopes didn't let me down
Now you're by my side and I feel so good
I've nothing to hide don't feel that I ever could


Do you hear what I'm saying?
Gotta say how I feel
I can't believe you're here
But I know that you're real
I know what I want, and baby, it's you
I can't deny my feelings because they are true


Dreams can come true
Look at me, babe, I'm with you
You know you gotta have hope
You know you gotta be strong
Dreams can come true
Look at me, babe, I'm with you
You know you gotta have hope
You know you gotta be strong


I'm not making plans for tomorrow let's live for tonight
I know I want you, baby, so hold me so tight
Put your arms around me you make me feel so safe
Then you whisper in my ear that you're here to stay


Dreams can come true
Look at me, babe, I'm with you
You know you gotta have hope
You know you gotta be strong
Dreams can come true
Look at me, babe, I'm with you
You know you gotta have hope
You know you gotta be strong
Dreams can come true
Look at me, babe, I'm with you
You know you gotta have hope
You know you gotta be strong
Dreams can come true
Look at me, babe, I'm with you
You know you gotta have hope
You know you gotta be strong
