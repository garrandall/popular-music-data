Tonight's the night we'll make history
Honey, you and I
And I'll take any risk to tie back the hands of time
And stay with you here tonight
I know you feel these are the worst of times
I do believe it's true
When people lock their doors and hide inside
Rumor has it, it's the end of paradise
But I know, if the world just passed us by
Baby I know, I wouldn't have to cry, no no
The best of times are when I'm alone with you
Some rain some shine, we'll make this a world for two
Our memories of yesterday will last a lifetime
We'll take the best, forget the rest
And someday we'll find
These are the best of times
These are the best of times
The headlines read, "These are the worst of times"
I do believe it's true
I feel so helpless like a boat against the tide
I wish the summer winds could bring back paradise
But I know, if the world turned upside down
Baby, I know you'd always be around, my my
The best of times are when I'm alone with you
Some rain some shine, we'll make this a world for two
The best of times are when I'm alone with you
Some rain some shine, we'll make this a world for two
