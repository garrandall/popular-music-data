Sugar is sweet
But not as sweet as my baby
Honey's a treat but it
Can't compete with my baby

Cause they know I found
(Know I found) know I found
The sweetest thing
This side of Heaven
The sweetest thing
This side of Heaven
The sweetest thing
This side of Heaven
The sweetest thing
This side of Heaven

Blue skies are fair
But not as fair as my baby
Diamonds are rare but they
Can't compare with my baby

If I lose her
I sure would lose a lot
So I try to please her
Cause I know I got
(Know I got) know I got

The sweetest thing
This side of Heaven
The sweetest thing
This side of Heaven
The sweetest thing
This side of Heaven

Ooh, I love her so
Ooh, I'll never let her go

No one can steal this
Love I feel for my baby
Others appeal but they're
Not real like my baby

She's a lot like a miracle to me
And if she's not an angel
Then she's got to be
(Got to be) got to be

The sweetest thing
This side of Heaven
The sweetest thing
This side of Heaven

Honey's a treat but it
Can't compete with my baby
Diamonds are rare but they
Can't compare with my baby

The sweetest thing this side...
