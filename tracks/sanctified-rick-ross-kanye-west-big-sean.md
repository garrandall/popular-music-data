There's a field with angels movin' around me
I just worship thee, for all he's done for me
It's a new day, I have been born again
I've been born again, I've been born again
In His spirit, and His name, I'm sanctified!
Lord I testify, he's right by my side
I believe it be, His word is so clear to me
Yeah, yeah


All I want's 100 million dollars and a bad bitch
Plus that paper chasin', it done turn me to a savage
Groupies in the lobby, they just tryna get established
God, I've been guilty, fornicatin' from my status


All I wanted was 100 million dollars and a bad bitch
Plus that paper chasin', it had turned me to a savage
Groupies in the lobby they just tryna get established
God, I've been guilty, fornicatin' from my status


Niggas be lovin' the old Ye, they sayin' the new Ye, that nigga be spazzin'
But when Ali turn up and be Ali, you can't ever change that nigga back to Cassius
So you can gon' and make up lies, but I'm so sanctified
I don't sweat it, wipe my forehead with a handkerchief
And wash my sins in the blood of Jesus (Ross grunt)
People sayin', "Ye we need another Yeezus" (Ross grunt)
Lames try to tell me, "Cut the wildin' out, out"
But who the fuck is you reachin'?
Pass me 30 bottles, champagne procession
That's that Holy water, sanctified refreshments
God sent me a message, said I'm too aggressive
Really!? Me!? Too aggressive!?


I can feel his blessings wash away my sins
I'm sanctified and, I have been born again
Now I proclaim, hallowed be thy name
Ohhh




Keys to my success, I get new keys and new address
Bitches that I date don't get degrees but they can dress
Fellatio's amazin', make grilled cheese for you, the best
Major cult figure, I'm the fresh David Koresh
Soldiers all in gators, new Mercedes for cadets
Balmain uniform, you know Donda designed the vest
Double M, that be the Army, better yet, the Navy
Baby seen me in that Wraith, wanna have my baby
All I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch
Now I want two hundred and m√©nage in my palace
Walkin' out the jeweler with no mothafuckin' balance
Somewhere in Jamaica I'm still holdin' on my chalice
Rims on my Ferrari, my bitch said that I was childish
'Til I fuck a girl, that girl tweeted that I was stylish
When we fucked again, she told me "That was just some foul shit"
I walk into the room, you can even hear all the silence
