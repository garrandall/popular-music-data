When I was a little girl I had a rag doll
Only doll I've ever owned
Now I'll love you just the way I loved that rag doll
But only now my love has grown

And it gets stronger in every way
And it gets deeper. Let me say
And it gets higher day by day

Do I love you? My, oh, my
River-deep, mountain-high, yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lost you would I cry
Oh, how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby

When you were a young boy, did you have a puppy?
That always followed you around
Well I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy
No, I'll never let you down

'Cause it grows stronger like a river flows
And it gets bigger, baby, and heaven knows
And it gets sweeter, baby, as it grows

Do I love you? My, oh, my
River-deep, mountain-high! Yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lost you would I cry?
Oh, how I love you, baby, baby, baby, baby

I love you, baby, like a flower loves the spring
I love you, baby, like a robin loves to sing
And I love you, baby, like the schoolboy loves his pet
And I love you, baby, river-deep, mountain-high

Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Oh, baby

Do I love you? My, oh, my
River-deep, mountain-high! Yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lost you would I cry?
Oh, how I love you, baby, baby, baby, baby
