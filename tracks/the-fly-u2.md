(Oh, baby child)

It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky
It's no secret that our world is in darkness tonight
They say the sun is sometimes eclipsed by a moon
You know I don't see you when she walks in the room

It's no secret that a friend is someone who lets you help
It's no secret that a liar won't believe anyone else
They say a secret is something you tell one other person
So I'm telling you...child

Low Voice Gospel Voice

A man will beg Love...we shine like a
A man will crawl burning star
On the sheer face of love We're falling from
Like a fly on a wall the sky...tonight
It's no secret at all

It's no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest
It's no secret ambition bites the nails of success
Every artist is a cannibal, every poet is a thief
All kill their inspiration and sing about their grief
Oh love...

Low Voice Gospel Voice

A man will rise Love...we shine like a
A man will fall burning star
From the sheer face of love We're falling from
Like a fly from a wall the sky...tonight
It's no secret at all

(Achtung Baby)

(Love...we shine like a burning star)
(We're falling from the sky...tonight)

Low Voice Gospel Voice

A man will rise Love...we shine like a
A man will fall burning star
From the sheer face of love We're falling from
Like a fly from a wall the sky...tonight
It's no secret at all

It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky
The universe exploded 'cause of one man's lie
Look, I gotta go, yeah I'm running outta change
There's a lot of things, if I could I'd rearrange
