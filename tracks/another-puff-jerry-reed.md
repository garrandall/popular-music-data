I know there's a lot of talk going around today
About cigarette smoke and whittlin' your life away
I've seen it and I've heard it so many times
That finally it just started to pray on my mind
I guess it scared me a little bit
That's why I decided I was going to quit
So while I was sitting here forming my battle plan
I took another puff and turned on the fan
I just sat there in my easy chair
And thought of all the money I've wasted on cigarettes all these years
I thought how I'd spend the rest of my days
After I kick this habit my body craves
I said to myself this ain't gonna be so tough
And with that little bit of insurance I took another puff

I took a puff I puffed then I ripped off another puff
I decided I about had about enough
That breaking this habit won't be too tough
Now I gave a lot of thought to this thing
If I didn't smoke cigarettes I'd feel just like a king
Besides with the price going up every day
I knew I was just throwing all my good money away
You know I ain't lit one in an hour or so
Just wanted to make sure I could quit you know
I was thinking maybe I ought to write all this down
And put it in a song kinda circulate it around
Can't ever tell it might make a hit not after they call a little bit
Can you imagine me a hit songwriter
Now where'd I put that cigarette lighter
After all it's a habit and a habit you can break
Just a little bit of willpower son that's all it takes
I said to myself you gotta be tough
And with that little bitty wisdom I took another puff

I took a puff and I puffed then I ripped off another puff

I decided boy this ainât gonna be tough besides I'd just about had enough
I'm about ready to quit this rotten habit anyway
Oh I think they ought to take it off the television it looks too good
I like them skinny ones with the filter
Give it to me give it to me take a rest
I say if I quit smoking what'll I do maybe I'll eat
Maybe I'll eat cigarettes
Oh I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it
Chester B don't smoke he smokes logs
Makes you laugh funny too oh my throat's scratching
Lord I wish I could think of something bad to say about cigarettes
Boo on cigarettes ha ha ha
Don't smoke don't smoke don't smoke
You quit smokin' that'll leave more for me
I love it I love it no I don't love cigarettes
Donât misunderstand me I hate cigarettes
Makes you cough when you don't smoke it makes you shake
I don't know what's worse to shake or to cough
I think I'll make me a cough shake
Son did you ever smoke oh I remember one time I quit smoking
I quit for three months
My wife left me so did my children she took my house and left
It was a mobile home ha ha
