I know we're just like old friends 
We just can't pretend 
That lovers make amends 
We are reasons so unreal 
We can't help but feel that something has been lost 

But please you know you're just like me 
Next time I promise we'll be 
Perfect 
Perfect 
Perfect strangers down the line 
Lovers out of time 
Memories unwind 

So far I still know who you are 
But now I wonder who I was... 

Angel, you know it's not the end 
We'll always be good friends 
The letters have been sent on 

So please, you always were so free 
You'll see, I promise we'll be 
Perfect 
Perfect strangers when we meet 
Strangers on the street 
Lovers while we sleep

Perfect 
You know this has to be 
We always we're so free 
We promised that we'd be 
Perfect
