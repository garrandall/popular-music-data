I'm saying I'm sorry for leaving you 
But I wanted to start my life brand new
I was going through changes and could not see 
That with you is where I wanna be

Nothing compares to you 
And I hurt from the pain that I put you through
Baby, I need you desperately
Cuz I gotta be

Where you are
Anywhere you are, it don't matter how far
Where you are
Anywhere you are, it don't matter how far
Where you are
Anywhere you are, it don't matter how far
Where you are

Where you are, uh huh, oh

Being apart got the best of me
And I know that in life there's no guarantees
Please say that you still got love for me
Cuz I'm missing home

I'm never gonna leave 
And I say it because you're all I need
For better or worse, to the end of time 
I gotta be

Where you are
Anywhere you are, it don't matter how far
Where you are
Anywhere you are, it don't matter how far
Where you are
Anywhere you are, it don't matter how far
Where you are

Where you are, and where you are
Where you are, oh

I am sorry for all the things I put ya through
Baby, you are my world
I can't live my life without you

Can I come back home where I belong
Cuz I'm so alone
Baby girl, I'm on my knees, beggin' please
Cuz with you is where I wanna be

Where you are
Anywhere you are, it don't matter how far
Where you are
Anywhere you are, it don't matter how far
Where you are
Anywhere you are, it don't matter how far
Where you are

I just wanna be where you are baby
