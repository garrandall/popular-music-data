Why are you leaving me now, boy?

We were not just lovers
We were not just friends, boy
The time we shared was not a simple love affair
No

We learned about each other
That you're so afraid of the love, boy
There is no one that could ever love me better
No

Time and time again
I thought you were my friend
You say you gotta go
And I want you to know

If you leave me now, boy
I'll close my eyes and I'll just lay down and cry
Why would you leave me now, boy
After all the things that we've been through?
You say you leave me now, boy
And when you're gone, what am I supposed to do?
And if you wanna come back to me
I think you should know that I'll be loving you
I'll be loving you

No more changes for my life
I pray to God that you'll come back to me
When we're together
There's nothing better than loving you

I wanna know why you're leaving, boy
The love we had was an open door
What happened to the dreams we shared together?
No

Time and time again
I thought you were my friend
You say you gotta go
And I want you to know

Why are you leaving me now, boy
After all the things that we've been through?
(You know I love you)
You know I still love you
(You know I need you)

Time and time again
I thought you were my friend
You say you gotta go
And I want you to know

If you leave me now, boy
I'll close my eyes and I'll just lay down and cry
Why would you leave me now, boy
After all the things that we've been through?
You say you leave me now, boy
And when you're gone, what am I supposed to do?
And if you wanna come back to me
I think you should know that I'll be loving you
(I'll be loving you)

If you leave me now, boy
I'll close my eyes and I'll just lay down and cry
Why would you leave me now, boy?
After all the things that we've been through?
You say you leave me now, boy
And when you're gone, what am I supposed to do?
And if you wanna come back to me
I think you should know that I'll be loving you

If you leave me now, boy
I'll close my eyes and I'll just lay down and cry
Why would you leave me now, boy?
After all the things that we've been through?
You say you leave me now, boy
And when you're gone, what am I supposed to do?
And if you wanna come back to me
I think you should know that I'll be loving you
