Well I went to bed in Memphis
And I woke up in Hollywood 
I got a quarter
in my pocket 
And I'd call you if I could 
But I don't know why 
I gotta fly 
I wanna rock and roll this party 
I still wanna have some fun 
I wanna leave you feeling breathless 
Show you how the west was won 
But I gotta fly 
I gotta fly


Like Steve McQueen
All I need's a fast machine 
I'm gonna make it all right 
Like Steve McQueen 
Underneath your radar screen 
You'll never catch me tonite

I ain't takin' shit off no one 
Baby that was yesterday 
I'm an all American rebel 
Making my big getaway 
Yeah you know it's time 
I gotta fly 



We got rockstars in the Whitehouse 
All our popstars look like porn 
All my heroes hit the highway 
They don't hang out here no more 
You can tell me on my cellphone
You can page me all night long 
But you won't catch this freebird 
I'll already be long gone 
Like Steve McQueen 
All we need's a fast machine 
And we're gonna make it all right
