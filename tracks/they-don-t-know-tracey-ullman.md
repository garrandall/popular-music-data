You've been around
For such a long time now
Oh, maybe I could leave you
But I don't know how

And why should I be lonely every night
When I can be with you
Oh, yes
You make it right


And I don't listen to the guys who say
That you're bad for me
And I should turn you away
Cause they don't know 'bout us
And they've never heard of love


I get a feeling when I look at you
Wherever you go now
I wanna be there too

They say we're crazy
But I just don't care
And if they keep on talking
Still they get nowhere


So I don't mind if they don't understand
When I look at you when you hold my hand
Cause they don't know 'bout us
And they've never heard of love


Why should it matter to us
If they don't approve
We should just take our chances
While we've got nothing to lose
Baby


There's no need for living in the past
Now I've found good loving
Gonna make it last

I tell the others
Don't bother me
Cause when they look at you
They don't see what I see


No, I don't listen to their wasted lines
Got my eyes wide open
And I see the signs
Cause they don't know 'bout us
And they've never heard of love
