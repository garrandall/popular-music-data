Lonely women are the desperate kind
And I am hanging at the end of a line
Losing hope when the call doesn't come
It's a feeling I choose over feeling none

Ah, then you stumble in
And I am tumblin' back where it begins

'Cause you can spread my wings
And send a thousand dreams
To flood a million streams with emotion

And you can fill my nights
Oh, and blow out all my lights
'Til I see nothing right by emotion
My emotion

I'm running out of ways of makin' you care
As hard as I try you know it just isn't fair
For all I give, I'm only getting old
When I think I'm finally back in control

Ah, then you stumble in
And I am tumblin' back where it begins

'Cause you can spread my wings
And send a thousand dreams
To flood a million streams with emotion

And you can fill my nights
Oh, and blow out all my lights
'Til I see nothing right by emotion

And you can spread my wings
And send a thousand dreams
And flood a million streams with emotion

And you can fill my nights
Oh, and blow out all my lights
'Til I see nothing right by emotion
