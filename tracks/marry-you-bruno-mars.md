It's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby
I think I wanna marry you

Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares baby
I think I wanna marry you

Well I know this little chapel on the boulevard we can go oh oh oh
No one will know oh oh oh
Oh, come on, girl
Who cares if we're trashed got a pocket full of cash we can blow oh oh oh
Shots of patron
And it's on, girl

Don't say no, no, no, no-no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
And we'll go, go, go, go-go
If you're ready, like I'm ready

Cause it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby
I think I wanna marry you

Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares baby
I think I wanna marry you

I'll go get a ring let the choir bells sing like oh
So what you wanna do?
Let's just run girl

If we wake up and you wanna break up that's cool
No, I won't blame you
It was fun, girl

Don't say no, no, no, no-no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
And we'll go, go, go, go-go
If you're ready, like I'm ready

Cause it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby
I think I wanna marry you

Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares baby
I think I wanna marry you

Just say I do uh-huh
Tell me right now baby
Tell me right now baby, baby
Just say I do uh-huh
Tell me right now baby
Tell me right now baby, baby

Oh, it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby
I think I wanna marry you

Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares baby
I think I wanna marry you
