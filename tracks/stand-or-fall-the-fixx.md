Crying parents tell their children
If you survive, don't do as we did
A son exclaims there'll be nothing to do to
Her daughter says she'll be dead with you

While foreign affairs are screwing us rotten
Line morale has hit rock bottom
Dying embers stand forgotten
Talks of peace were being trodden

Stand or fall
State your peace tonight
Stand or fall
State your peace tonight

Is this the value of our existence
Should we proclaim with such persistence
Our destiny relies on conscience
Red or blue, what's the difference

Stand or fall
State your peace tonight
Stand or fall
State your peace tonight

It's the euro theatre
It's the euro theatre
It's the euro theatre

An empty face reflects extinction
Ugly scars divide the nation
Desecrate the population
There will be no exaltation

Stand or fall
State your peace tonight
Stand or fall
State your peace tonight

It's the euro theatre
It's the euro theatre
It's the euro theatre

Stand or fall
Stand or fall
Stand or fall
Stand or fall
Stand or fall
Stand or fall
