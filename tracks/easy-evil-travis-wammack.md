Well you are such an easy evil
Such a senuous sin
Sometimes I don't know where I'm goin'
'Til I been takin' in

Such an easy evil
Such a promise of fun
Sometimes I don't know what I'm doin'
'Til I'm done
You're a sneaky one

Here she comes now
Touchin' me
Callin' my name again

Here I go now
Like a moth to a flame
I'm a sucker for you baby

Such an easy evil
Such a promise of fun
Sometimes I don't know what I'm doin'
'Til I'm done
You're a sneaky one

Here she comes now
Touchin' me
Callin' my name again

Here I go now
Like a moth to a flame
I'm a sucker for you baby

(Foreign lyrics)

Such an easy evil
Such a senuous sin
Such an easy evil
Such a senuous sin
Such an easy evil
Such a senuous sin
