There's talk on the street
It sounds so familiar
Great expectations, everybody's watching you
People you meet
They all seem to know you
Even your old friends treat you like you're something new

Johnny come lately, the new kid in town
Everybody loves you, so don't let them down

You look in her eyes
The music begins to play
Hopeless romantics, here we go again
But after awhile
You're lookin' the other way
It's those restless hearts that never mend

Johnny come lately, the new kid in town
Will she still love you when you're not around?

There's so many things you should have told her
But night after night you're willing to hold her
Just hold her
Tears on your shoulder

There's talk on the street
It's there to remind you
It doesn't really matter which side you're on
You're walking away
And they're talking behind you
They will never forget you 'til somebody new comes along

Where you've been lately? There's a new kid in town
Everybody loves him
Don't they?
Now he's holding her, and you're still around

Oh, my, my
There's a new kid in town
Just another new kid in town

Everybody's talking 'bout the new kid in town
Everybody's walking like the new kid in town

There's a new kid in town
I don't wanna hear it
There's a new kid in town
I don't wanna hear it
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town

There's a new kid in town
(Everybody's talking)
There's a new kid in town
(People started walking)
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town
