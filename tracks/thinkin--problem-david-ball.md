Yes, I admit I've got a thinkin' problem
She's always on my mind
Her memory goes round and round
I've tried to quit a thousand times
Yes, I admit I've got a thinkin' problem
Fill the glass up to the top
I'll start with loving her
But I don't know when to stop


I wake up and right away
Her name is on my lips
Once the memories start to flow
I can't stop with just one sip


Yes, I admit I've got a thinkin' problem
She's always on my mind
Her memory goes round and round
I've tried to quit a thousand times
Yes, I admit I've got a thinkin' problem
Fill the glass up to the top
I'll start with loving her
But I don't know when to stop


I keep on remembering
How good it used to be
Gettin' stoned all alone
On my favorite memory


Yes, I admit I've got a thinkin' problem
She's always on my mind
Her memory goes round and round
I've tried to quit a thousand times
Yes, I admit I've got a thinkin' problem
Fill the glass up to the top
I'll start with loving her
But I don't know when to stop
I'll start with lovin' her
But I don't know when to stop
