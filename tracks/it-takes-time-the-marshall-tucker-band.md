When you're feeling down and low
And you don't know which way your life should go
It takes time it takes time it takes time

And when you're feeling down and out
And you can't figure your own life out
It takes time it takes time it takes time

It takes time to go... where you want to go
It takes time to be... what you want to be
It takes time to see... what you want to see
Don't get in a hurry...'cause it takes time

Well there's no use to feel sorry and blue
You can go and do anything you want to
But it takes time it takes time it takes time

And when you're feeling down and out
And you can't figure your own life out
It takes time it takes time it takes time

It takes time to go... where you want to go
It takes time to be... what you want to be
It takes time to see... what you want to see
Don't get in a hurry... it takes time
