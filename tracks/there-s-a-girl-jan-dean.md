La-da-da, dum-da-da-da-da-daa
Um-da um-da um-da da-da-daa
Um-da um-da um-da da

There's a girl
I think I'd like to know
I sure would like to know
And hold her in my arms so close, so close

There's a girl
As pretty as a girl can be
I wish that she belonged to me
I'll never ever let her go

She's kind of naughty
She's kind of nice
Gee I wish that she were mine
She walks real cute
And she talks real cute
And everything about her is so fine
La-da-da, dum-da-da-da-da-daa
La-da-da, dum-da-da-da-da-daa

There's a girl
I know she doesn't know it yet
But I'm the boy she's gonna get
Just you wait and see

She's kind of naughty
She's kind of nice
Gee I wish that she were mine
She walks real cute
And she talks real cute
And everything about her is so fine
La-da-da, dum-da-da-da-da-daa
La-da-da, dum-da-da-da-da-daa

There's a girl
I know she doesn't know it yet
But I'm the boy she's gonna get
Just you wait and see

La-da-da, dum-da-da-da-daa
Just you wait and see
La-da-da, dum-da-da-da-daa
Um-da um-da um-da da-da-daa
Um-da um-da um-da da
Ohh-woah, wah wah
