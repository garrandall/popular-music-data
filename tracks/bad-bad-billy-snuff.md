It's like a scene right out of west side story
He's on the corner at the same place every night
He has some friend that are sure to get him over
Tight jeans fitting right

No match or rumble, he's gonna get in trouble
Nobody's gonna stop him just try

Bad, bad Billy he's scheming and dreaming tonight
Bad Billy

Empty hearts and empty faces
In his mind he knows how to sink or swim
Many bodies and lonely faces
All he knows is he doesn't want to be like them

Add it up, figure it out
It never ever comes out even

Bad Billy he's scheming and dreaming tonight
Bad Billy
Bad Billy he's scheming and dreaming tonight
Bad Billy

Leather jacket over white t-shirt
Stonewall Billy can't be hurt
But groovy lips and pleated skirts
Will have their way

Bad Billy are you really bad?
Or only lonely when you get mad?
Do you wanna love?
Do you wanna fight?

Bad Billy he's scheming and dreaming tonight
Bad Billy

No match or rumble, he's gonna get in trouble
Nobody's gonna stop him just try

Bad, bad billy he's scheming and dreaming tonight
Bad billy

Empty hearts and empty faces
In his mind he knows how to sink or swim
Pretty bodies and lonely faces
All he knows is he doesn't want to be like them

Add it up, figure it out
It never ever comes out even

Bad, bad billy he's scheming and dreaming tonight
Bad billy
Bad billy he's scheming and dreaming tonight
Bad billy

Leather jacket over white t-shirt
Stonewall Billy can't be hurt
But groovy lips and pleated skirts
Will have their way

Bad Billy are you really bad?
Bad Billy, bad bad billy
Bad Billy are you really bad?
Bad Billy, bad bad billy
Bad Billy are you really bad?
Bad Billy, bad bad billy
Bad Billy are you really bad?
Bad Billy, bad bad billy
