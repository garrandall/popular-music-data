Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
And she loves me
There's nothing more I can say

Skies above me
Never were as blue as her eyes
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
And she loves me
Who would want a sweeter surprise

When I nestle in his arms
So tenderly (so tenderly)
There's a thrill I can't express

In my heart
A song of love is haunting me
Memories taunting me

Sweet, sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
Whoa, oh, oh
And she loves me
There's nothing more I can say

Sweet, sweet, sweet and lovely
Sweet, sweet, sweet and lovely
Sweet, sweet, sweet and lovely
There's nothing more I can say

When I nestle in his arms
So tenderly (so tenderly)
There's a thrill I can't express

In my heart
A song of love is haunting me
Memories taunting me

Sweet, sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
Whoa, oh, oh
And she loves me
There's nothing more I can say

Sweet, sweet, sweet and lovely
Sweet, sweet, sweet and lovely
Sweet, sweet, sweet and lovely
There's nothing more I can say

Sweet, sweet, sweet and lovely
Sweet, sweet, sweet and lovely
