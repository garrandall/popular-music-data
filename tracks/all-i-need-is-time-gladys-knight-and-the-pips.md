All I need is time
Until I get over you
A little at a time
 each day

All I need is time

To mend a dream or two
Live without the love
You took away

But mornings come again
And just like the day before
But the only change
Is that I love you more

And all I need is time
Maybe a thousand years
Maybe a million tears


Everybody says
The pain won't last too long
Just have a lot of fun
And time will fly

Well it took a lot of time
When love was 
And it's gonna take some time
For the love to die

But each and every day
I spend forgetting you
Well it brings another night
I never quite get through

And all I need is time
Maybe a thousand years
Maybe a million tears
But I need time
