The morning clouds are gathering around
As I stand on the bridge of the river
Years have gone since I was here
And I wonder how I differ
Taxi cabs keep rolling by
And a blind man asks for change
And here I stand a soldier in the rain.

Coming home was all I thought of...
Seeing my family and friends
They say love knows no distance
But the longing never ends
And all along the dreams I possessed
My heart never were to plain
And here I stand a soldier in the rain

I remember years ago
I had so many plans
And now I watch the river flow
Time has brought me here
With empty hands

I remember years ago
I had so many plans
And now I watch the river flow
Time has brought me here
With empty hands

The morning clouds are gathering around
And the streets are full of reflections
A traffic light and the moon still bright
People going in different directions
I've thought about why I'm here
Its just too hard to explain
And here I stand a soldier in the rain
In the rain...
