Some men only want power
Let them have it
We all have our reasons for wanting to survive
Just give them a chance and they'll grab at it
God only knows how much is enough to keep them satisfied

Now I don't need more money
Cause I don't see the world the way they do
And I don't care what they're in it for
Or what they're dreaming of
I'm in it for you
You're in it for me
We're in it for love

Some fools want their glory
How they crave it
From my point of view
There only prisoners of their own device
Don't give it to me
They can have it
Cause darlin' I've found
My paradise within your loving eyes

You may never see me
Staring from a front page of a magazine
Cause I don't want to be a big a star
In a world of push and shove
I'm in it for you
You're in it for me
We're in it for love
I'm in it for you
You're in it for me
We're in it for love

Now I don't need their money
Cause I don't see the world the way they do
How can you believe that love is part love?
The whole world needs more love
I'm in it for you
You're in it for me
We're in it for love
I'm in it for you
You're in it for me
We're in it for love

X3... repeat fade out...
