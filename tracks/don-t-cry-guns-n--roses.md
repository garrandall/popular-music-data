Talk to me softly, there's something in your eyes
Don't hang your head in sorrow and please don't cry
I know how you feel inside, I've, I've been there before
Something is changing inside you and don't you know?


Don't you cry tonight, I still love you, baby
And don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry tonight


Give me a whisper and give me a sigh
Give me a kiss before you tell me goodbye
Don't you take it so hard now and please don't take it so bad
I'll still be thinking of you and the times we had, baby


And don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry tonight




And please remember that I never lied, oh
And please remember how I felt inside now, honey
You gotta make it your own way but you'll be alright now, sugar
You'll feel better tomorrow, come the morning light now, baby


And don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry
Don't you ever cry
Don't you cry tonight, baby, maybe someday
Don't you cry, don't you ever cry
Don't you cry tonight
