Though I know that you are sleepin' 
Girl, there's somethin' I must say 
Though the road may wind
My love will find the way

Many miles have come between us
And the days, they come and go
Still with all we feel
It never really shows

Hold me, touch me
And think of me when we're apart
Hold me, baby won't you touch me
And think of me here in the night
And you know it'll be alright

Though the time apart seems endless
All my thoughts remain with you
I believe one day
We'll make our dreams come true

Our goodbyes go on forever
And with all that we may say
Till tomorrow comes
We'll dream of yesterday

Hold me, baby won't you touch me
And think of me when we're apart
Hold me, baby won't you touch me
And think of me here in the night
And you know it'll be alright

Mmm, aha, yeah
