Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


I think I did it again
I made you believe we're more than just friends, oh, baby
It might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious


'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me, ooh, baby, baby


Oops!... I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
Oh, baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent


You see, my problem is this, I'm dreaming away
Wishing that heroes, they truly exist
I cry watching the days
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways?


But to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me, oh, baby, oh


Oops!... I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
Oh, baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


"All aboard!"
"Britney, before you go, there's something I want you to have"
"Oh, it's beautiful! But wait a minute, isn't this?"
"Yeah, yes, it is."
"But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean in the end"
"Well, baby, I went down and got it for ya"
"Aw, you shouldn't have"


Oops!... I did it again to your heart
Got lost in this game, oh, baby
Oops, you (oops, you) think that I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent


Oops!... I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
Oh, baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent
Oops!... I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
Oh, baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent
