I thought I knew you
Thought that I knew you well
We had a rhythm
But I guess you never can tell

Oh I learned early
Never to ignore the signs
You'll be forgiven
It ain't worth that much to my mind

Lovin' you (was) so easy
It's hard to say goodbye
But if that's the way it goes it goes

Just a page in my history
Just another one of those mysteries
One more lover that used to be
If you think you're in my head
You've been seriously misled

Seriously misled

Loving somebody ain't your average 9 to 5
It takes conviction it takes a will to survive
I'm not somebody who commits the crime
And leaves the scene
But when I've been dissed
I don't spend much time on what might've been
I'm not about self-pity
Your love did me wrong
Now I'm movin', movin' on

Just a page in my history
Just another one of those mysteries
One more lover that used to be
If you think you're in my head
You've been seriously misled

Seriously misled

I get on with my life
And you're not on my mind
Am I too close to time
To get over you

I'm not about self-pity
Your love did me wrong
So I'm moving on (and on, and on, and on, and on)

Just a page in my history
Just another one of those mysteries
(just another page)
One more lover that used to be
If you think you're in my head
You're seriously misled

Just a page in my history
Just another one of those mysteries
One more lover that used to be
If you think it, think it, think it, think it, baby

Just a page in my history
Just another one of those mysteries
One more lover that used to be
If you think you're in my head
You've been seriously misled
