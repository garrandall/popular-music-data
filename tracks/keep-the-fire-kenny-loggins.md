There's a river in
Evening ember glow
And you're wishing you could see
How far it flows
Rolling on to an endless sea
You'd be well on your way
If you could only set sail.

But dreams can drift away
And sails can fill with doubt
Where's your vision
If the embers flicker out?
Don't let it slip from view

The horizons are waiting
Your river is fading


So keep the fire burning tonight
See just what comes into sight
Don't take forever
Take it through the night

And believe the sun
Will rise with the dawn
That's all you need to go on
But for tonight
Just keep the fire burning bright

I will never need to ask
"What have I done?"
Comes a moment when it's clear
There's only one.
Oh, whatever you need of me
I've made up my mind
I'll give you more than you've asked for

And there are those who can foresee
Where we will go
All the future...
I don't really want to know
Only that you'll be here with me.

While the embers still glow
We'll be safe till tomorrow.
