She likes bars, she likes diamonds, too
She likes stars if they rendezvous
She likes champagne to maintain her style
She likes a man only for a while

She likes access to your bank account
She likes dollars, she likes British pounds
She likes money only in high amounts
Baby, she cool she knows what counts

She likes to pay with credit cards, ride expensive cars
Stays in the president suite
(Ha, ha, ha, ha)
And every day she's looking for a man who gives her more
To satisfy her needs

She's a soul shaker, troublemaker, she is a heart breaker
Undertaker, moneymaker, she is a lover faker
Soul shaker, troublemaker, she is a heart breaker
Undertaker, moneymaker, she is a love faker

Tricky, tricky
But she is pretty, pretty
She is tricky, tricky
But she is pretty, pretty
So damn pretty

I like holidays when there's nothing to do
I like fun for free and a ice cold brew
I like to watch football on TV
I like to sleep and wake up around 3:00

I like to hang out with my boys making lots of noise
Dancing in the club there is no choice
She will never understand that I can be her man
I am what I am so damn

She likes to pay with credit cards, ride expensive cars
Stays in the president suite
(Ha, ha, ha, ha)
And every day she's looking for a man who gives her more
To satisfy her needs

She's a soul shaker, troublemaker, she is a heart breaker
Undertaker, moneymaker, she is a lover faker
Soul shaker, troublemaker, she is a heart breaker
Undertaker, moneymaker, she is a love faker

Tricky, tricky
But she is pretty, pretty
She is tricky, tricky
But she is pretty, pretty
So damn pretty

Tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky
But she is pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty
Tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky
But she is pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty

She's a soul shaker, troublemaker, she is a heart breaker
Undertaker, moneymaker, she is a lover faker
Soul shaker, troublemaker, she is a heart breaker
Undertaker, moneymaker, she is a love faker

Tricky, tricky
But she is pretty, pretty
She is tricky, tricky
But she is pretty, pretty
So damn pretty
