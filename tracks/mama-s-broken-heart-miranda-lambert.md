I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
I screamed his name ‘til the neighbours called the cops
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
Don’t know what I did next, all I know I couldn’t stop


Word got around to the barflies and the baptists
My mama’s phone started ringing off the hook
I can hear her now saying she ain’t gonna have it
Don’t matter how you feel, it only matters how you look


Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart


Wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holding the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there’s nobody else to blame


Can’t get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
Sometimes revenge's just a choice you gotta make
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face


Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart


Powder your nose, paint your toes
Line your lips and keep 'em closed
Cross your legs, dot your eyes
And never let 'em see you cry


Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart
