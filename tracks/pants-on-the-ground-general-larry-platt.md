Pants on the ground
Pants on the ground
Lookinâ like a fool with yo pants on the ground
With yo gold in yo mouth
Hat turned sideways, pants hit the ground
Call yourself a cool cat, lookin like a fool
Walkinâ downtown with your pants on the ground
Get it up, hey, get your pants off the ground
Walkinâ, talkinâ with your pants on the ground
Get it up, hey, get your pants on the ground
Lookinâ like a fool with your pants on the ground
Gold in your mouth
Hat turned sideways
Call yourself a cool cat, yeah, lookinâ like a fool
Walkinâ, talkinâ with your pants on the ground
Boom, boom, pants on the ground
Lookinâ like a fool with your pants on the ground
With your gold in your mouth
Hat turned sideways, pants hit the ground
Call yourself a cool cat
