There's got to be a better way to do it
A better way to go from place to place
I said there's got to be a better way to do it
A better way to go from place to place

There's got to be a better way to do it
A better way to go from place to place
One thousand million miles in super highway
Put us out in wide open space

Super highway tearing through my city
Super highway tearing through my town
Super highway tearing through my country

Super highway, got to tear it down

There's got to be a better
There's got to be a better
There's got to be a better way to do it
A better way to go from place to place
There's got to be a better way to do it
A better way to go from place to place

No, no, no, no
There's got to be a better way to do it
A better way to go from place to place
I said there's got to be a better way to do it
A better way to go from place to place
No, no, no, no, no
