I like bread and butter
I like toast and jam
That's what my baby feeds me
I'm her loving man

He likes bread and butter
He likes toast and jam
That's what his baby feeds him
He's her loving man

She don't cook mashed potatoes
She don't cook T-bone steaks
Don't feed me peanut butter
She knows that I can't take

He likes bread and butter
He likes toast and jam
That's what his baby feeds him
He's her loving man

Got home early one morning
Much to my surprise
She was eating chicken and dumplings
With some other guy

No more bread and butter
No more toast and jam
I found my baby eating
With some other man
