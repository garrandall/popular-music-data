Mmm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, whoa
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Oh
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
If I was your man, girl


Girl, I'm so tired of things
I just wanna settle down
I swear to you I've changed
Baby, why you buggin' now?
I know that I put you through hell
And you deserve to be with someone else
But I gotta be straight up (straight up)
Girl, I just wanna kiss and make up (oh
We done been through a lot of things
How do you throw that away? (oh
You were the heart of me
Can't believe you let it break
Tell me why you won't let em go
You can say what you want, but I know
Baby, no more lies (more lies)
I'ma keep it real this time


Help me understand
What I'm sayin' ain't gettin' through
Why I can't be your man
When I'd give up the world for you
Girl, I'll do the best I can
Love you forever that's what I'll do
If I was your man
If I was your man
If I was your man


Got rid of everything
That I knew was hurtin' you
My hustle in the streets
Gave that up for you too
Don't want nothin' else in the way
I just wanna make sure that you stay
Baby, no more lies (more lies)
I'ma do it right this time


Help me understand
What I'm sayin' ain't gettin' through
Why I can't be your man
When I'd give up the world for you
Girl, I'll do the best I can
Love you forever that's what I'll do
If I was your man (if I was your man)
If I was your man (if I was your man)
If I was your man (if I was your man)


Can't live without you anymore
Baby, I know that you're worth fighting for
Baby, say that you'll still be with me
In my arms is where you need to be

Whoa
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Oh, yeah
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
If I was your man
If I was your man


Help me understand
What I'm sayin' ain't gettin' through
Why I can't be your man
When I'd give up the world for you
Girl, I'll do the best I can
Love you forever that's what I'll do
If I was your man (if I was your man, oh)
If I was your man
Help me understand
What I'm sayin' ain't gettin' through
Why I can't be your man
When I'd give up the world for you
Girl, I'll do the best I can
Love you forever that's what I'll do
If I was your man (if I was your man)
If I was your man (if I was your man)
