Darlin' I've been standin' here just watchin' you all night
And I think I've even caught you watchin' me a couple times
If I don't ask I'll never know
This may sound dumb, but here we go
Do you believe in love at first sight 

Me neither
I'm glad that we agree
Believe me
That's a big relief
Well, this place is awful crowded
And this music is so loud
Would you like to go and grab a bite to eat
Me neither 

It's nice to finally meet a girl who doesn't move too fast
I was only checkin', that's the reason that I asked
Relationships need time to grow
You and I should take this slow
And darlin' tell me, would you like to dance 

Me neither
I was just bein' polite
Thank goodness
My feet are much too tired
I'm sure you're tired too
I can see an empty booth
Would you like to maybe sit and talk a while
Me neither
We'd never get along
I'm thinkin' there's no chemistry at all
This has been a waste of time
And I'm runnin' outta lines
Don't you think it's time for me to end this song
Me neither
