Jill, between you and me
I can see the gleam in your eyes
And I can hardly wait to see you, Jill

Just as if you were here
I can hear your voice softly call
And no, no Jill is here at all
My love is only a dream away
Jill is only a dream

All my life, I've done crazy things
Gonna find a bird that sings to me

La la, you, la la la, ooh ooh

Jill, are you thinking of me?
I'll be thinking of you all my life

La la you, la la la, ooh ooh

Jill, are you thinking of me?
I'll be thinking of you all my life

Jill, Jill, Jill
