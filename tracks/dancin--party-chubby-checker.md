Everybody say yeah yeah
"Yeah Yeah"
Yeah Yeah
"Yeah Yeah"
Yeah Yeah
"Yeah Yeah"
Are you ready
"Yeah!"

Let's have a ball at the hall tonight
Boogie girl 'til the early bright
Make a scene with the record machine
Dancin' party tonight

Come on let's fly, the mash potato too
Watusi girl is the dance to do
Twist and shout till we knock ourselves out
Dancin' party tonight

Cause winter time is party time
And everything's alright
And everyone is feelin' fine
Every night's a Saturday night

Mess around, Bristol Stompin too
Hold me now like it's all brand new
Any dance that you wanna do
Dancin' party tonight

Well come on let's fly, mash potato too
Watusi girl is the dance to do
Anything that you wanna do
Dancin' party tonight

Cause winter time is party time
And everything's alright
And everyone is feelin' fine
Every night's Saturday night

Is  here? Yeah
Is Buddy here? Yeah
The Duke, are ya here? Yeah
So let's go!
