I hate you!
You a Liar! You a Cheat! You Defeated.
(I hate you!)
From the depths of my soul and I mean it!
You wanted to kill me, but it ain't goin be easy.
(cause I hate you.)
Yeh I'ma stand my ground and ima fight wit the Lamb of Jesus Christ!
I rebuke you I see what your tryin to do so I wrote this song for you.
Yes you cuz I hate you


Neva had a feelin like this before.
I ain't Neva really like ya since I came to the lord.
All stunts that you're pullin really gettin on my nerves
Forget what you used to forget what u heard.
The word: A light, a lamp, unto the feet I walk with.
The more I eat the more I hate the mouth that you talk with.
Holiness before me pull me back when I get near it.
I'd punch you in the face if you weren't in the spirit.
But the enemy comes with means to steal, kill, and to destroy us.
Doesn't matter what race ya'll.
Man,woman,girl, and boy yeh.
He Don't care nuttin bout ya
He's trying to take you out
Feels good but you're dieing man.
he's nasty and he's mean come on the winnin team
Don't play wit em no more you'll see I had to let em go.
Cuz I hate you


(I hate You!)
You a Liar! and the truth ain't in ya
(I hate you!)
Tried to kill my parents, my brothers, my sisters.
You wanted to kill me, but it ain't goin be easy.
(cause I hate you.)
I despise you with all my soul.
(I hate you) I'm disgusted by your presence alone.
I rebuke you and see what your tryin to do so I wrote this song for you.
Yes you Cuz I hate you

I am a bride yes God can mold me yes
I'm saved and my body's holy
Yes I was guilty but Christ died for me
Don't believe the lie ya'll the devils' phony.
He jus mad cuz he cant hold me no mo'
God opened doors he cant close
Tryin take me out yeh he came close I gotta word now ya'll and I'm throwin bones.
Like no weapon formed against me ya'll it can never prosper
Never seen the righteous of the LORD forsaken.
Nor his seed beggin' bread, yeh.
So on the real though I'm tired of this mess
Sick of this thing that we all call flesh.
Holy Ghost spreading I'm bout to do what they do and I'ma sprinkle all the ashes on you! (Yes you!)


(I hate You!)
You try to make me do wrong when I'm right
(I hate you!)
Trying to speak that in my new life.
You wanted to kill me, but it ain't goin be easy.
I'ma make hard as heck
(cause I hate you.)
I refuse to follow you and fail. (I hate you)
Ain't lifin my eyes up in no Hell.
I rebuke you and see what your tryin to do so I wrote this song for you
(I hate you)
You're an accuser of the saints.
(I hate you)
Ain't gunna choose death no more, I cant.
(I hate you)
You wanted to kill me but it ain't gunna be easy NO!
(I swear I hate you)
Every demon in hell yo grandmomma and you
(i hate you)
Ewww Satan I jus cant stand you.
I rebuke you and see what your tryin to do so I wrote this song for you.
(yes you cuz I hate you)

I hate you wanna fight you
Cant tell you how much I don't like you
A deceiver and a liar you get on my last nerve I despise you
You stupid and simple tryin to defile me
I'm a temple no I'm fed up and I want you to know THIS!


(I hate You!)
You a Liar! You a Cheat! You Deceive me.
(I hate you!)
From the depths of my soul and I mean it!
You wanted to kill me, but it ain't goin be easy.
(cause I hate you.)
Yeh I'ma stand my ground and fight! I am of the lamb of Jesus Christ!
I rebuke you and see what your tryin to do so I wrote this song for you.
(I hate you)
Ohhhh I hate you!
