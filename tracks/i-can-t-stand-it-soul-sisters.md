I can stand the pain of life
The ticking of the clock
I can stand the pain of love
And even stand the shock

But when I hear you say
That you will go away
And leave me someday
I can't stand it

Oh, no (oh no I can't stand it)
No I can't stand it (oh no I can't stand it)
I can't stand it (no no I can't stand it)
No I can't stand it

I can stand up for my rights
When the going gets tough
I can stand up in a fight
When I know I've had enough

But when I hear you say
That you will go away
And leave me someday
I can't stand it

Oh, no (oh no I can't stand it)
No I can't stand it (oh no I can't stand it)
I can't stand it (no no I can't stand it)
No I can't stand it

Oh, no
No no no
Oh, no

Standing close to me
It makes me kinda weak
And when you hold me tight
My poor heart skips a beat

But when I hear you say
That you will go away
And leave me someday
I can't stand it

Oh, no (no no I can't stand it)
No I can't stand it (no no I can't stand it)
I can't stand it (no no I can't stand it)
No I can't stand it

When you hurt me (I can't stand it)
When you kiss me (I can't stand it)
When you squeeze me (I can't stand it)
Ah, you know you kinda please me (I can't stand it)
I can't stand it (I can't stand it)
I can't stand it (No, I can't stand it)
I can't stand it (No, I can't stand it)
No, I can't stand it (I can't stand it)
No no, I can't stand it (No, I can't stand it)
No no, I can't stand it (I can't stand it)
No no, I can't stand it (Oh no, I can't stand it)
No no, I can't stand it (Baby when you love me)
No no, I can't stand it (No, I can't stand it)
