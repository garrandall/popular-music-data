Ohh, yeah yeah (wow), yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
We got London On Da Track

Hunnid and twenty, come catch me
Forties inside of my belly
Shouldn't be driving, I'm faded (skrt, yeah, yeah)
Rock that Nirvana, my favorite
Damn I forgot what her name is
She in the front seat head bangin' (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Money counter sound somethin' like a chopper, chopper
Speakers system bumpin', fuck your fuckin' block up
Used to mock him, now his cars some Bentley mock-ups
Killer drop a call from lockup
If you buy that Echo, why you lyin'? You broke
Got a knot in my tote, get you smoke like a stove
Keep on ridin' my coat, your new shit is a joke
Why you bitin' my flows? What you tryna be, Post?

Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, go on, keep it spinnin'
Ooh, yuck me up, I don't want no romancin'
Ooh, baby I see these muhfuckas glancin'
When my whip start, then my wheels keep spinnin'
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, go on, keep it spinnin'
Ooh, yuck me up, I don't want no romancin'
Ooh, baby I see these muhfuckas glancin'
When my whip start, then my wheels keep spinnin'

She used to shoppin' at the mall (ooh)
I'll teach lil baby how to ball
I hit Rodeo, spent like 40 G's (wow)
Four hunnid pairs of Gucci socks
I lost all my friends, made a lot of foes
Made a lot of M's, made a lot of O's
Open up the safe, I'm just with the bros
Cop the 458, cost me 250
Man, look at all my ice (ice)
I hit your main thing twice (your main thing twice)
Take a word of advice (a word of advice)
Break up with that ho (ho)

Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, go on, keep it spinnin'
Ooh, yuck me up, I don't want no romancin'
Ooh, baby I see these muhfuckas glancin'
When my whip start, then my wheels keep spinnin'
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, go on, keep it spinnin'
Ooh, yuck me up, I don't want no romancin'
Ooh, baby I see these muhfuckas glancin'
When my whip start, then my wheels keep spinnin'

Cold wrist frozen
Got sacks, Goldman
Bought the bar, Roseanne
No joke, they ain't playin'

Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, go on, keep it spinnin'
Ooh, yuck me up, I don't want no romancin'
Ooh, baby I see these muhfuckas glancin'
When my whip start, then my wheels keep spinnin'
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, go on, keep it spinnin'
Ooh, yuck me up, I don't want no romancin'
Ooh, baby I see these muhfuckas glancin'
When my whip start, then my wheels keep spinnin'

Yeah
We got London On Da Track
