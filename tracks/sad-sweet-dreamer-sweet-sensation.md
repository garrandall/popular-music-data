Sad sweet dreamer
It's just one of those things you put down to experience
Sad sweet dreamer
It's just one of those things you put down to experience

Been another blue day without you girl
Been another sad summer song
Been thinkin' about you girl
AII night long

Been another sad tear on my pillow
Been another memory who told me "You're the one girl"
Been thinkin' about you girl
All night long

Sad sweet dreamer
It's just one of those things you put down to experience
Sad sweet dreamer
It's just one of those things you put down to experience

Been another long night and I missed you girl
Been another story from those endless magazines
Can't help thinkin' about you girl
All night long

Sad sweet dreamer
It's just one of those things you put down to experience
Sad sweet dreamer
It's just one of those things you put down to experience

Was so happy when I found you
But how was I to know
That you would leave me walkin' down the road

Been another hurt love story
Been another man who thought that he was oh so strong
Been thinkin' about you girl
All night long

Sad sweet dreamer
It's just one of those things you put down to experience
Sad sweet dreamer
It's just one of those things you put down to experience
