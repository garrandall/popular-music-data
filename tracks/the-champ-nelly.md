Ever since I was a kid I’ve been dreaming about this
First day of practice I was thinking about this
Picture on the news, yeah they see about this
Even in the paper they gon' read about this
Cause all of my life
Training day and night
I’m preparing to fight
For everyone I believed in
I was going insane, they were screaming our name
While were spraying champagne
There’s nothing nobody can say


Cause today is the day
Is the day that I have always dreamed of forever
When you call me
You call me the champ of the world
I can raise my hands
I can scream I’m the best in the world
Whole world
All my blood, sweat and grind
Was all for this time


Lap after lap, mile after mile
Push up after push up
Everybody count it out
Everybody up, now we back down
All my pain and sweat was for this moment right now
All from different places well we came with each other
We came together as a team
But we’re leaving as brothers
Standing next to one another while we hold up our colors
I’m gon’ look in to the camera and tell my mama I love her
