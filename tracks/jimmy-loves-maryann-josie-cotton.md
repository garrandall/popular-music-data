Just seventeen, everything that she's seen
Is all there in her eyes
So many years of her poor mama's tears
And her daddy's red eyes
But there's nobody home
And Maryann's alone
Almost fully grown, and worldly wise
Jimmy's been down, he's been out and around
And he knows where it's at
Love would be good if he thought that he could
But it isn't like that
He don't make mistakes
What he needs, he takes
Jimmy is all the rage 'cause he knows how
Jimmy loves Maryann
Jimmy wants to be her man
Jimmy loves Maryann
She thinks it's alright
She's not alone when she picks up the phone
And she hears Jimmy say
"Baby, I feel so sick of the street, feel like runnin' away
There's no life here at all
The city seems so small

And there's a sweeter music calling us away"
Jimmy loves Maryann
Jimmy wants to be her man
Jimmy loves Maryann
She thinks it's alright, alright
Big money town, it'll drag you right down
If you go it alone
Even the strong don't survive very long
When they're out on their own
Jimmy knows it's true, and Maryann knows it, too
They could see each other through
If they hold on
Jimmy loves Maryann
Jimmy wants to be her man
Jimmy loves Maryann
She thinks it's alright
Jimmy loves Maryann
Jimmy wants to be her man
Jimmy loves Maryann
She thinks it's alright
Jimmy loves Maryann
Jimmy wants to be her man
Jimmy loves Maryann
Jimmy wants to be her man...
