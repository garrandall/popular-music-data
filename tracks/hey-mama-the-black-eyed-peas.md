(La la la la la)
Hey mama, this that shit that make you groove, mama
Get on the floor and move your booty mama
We the blast masters blastin' up the jamma
(REEEEEEEWIIIIIIND)
Cutie cutie, make sure you move your booty
Shake that thing like we in the city of sin, and
Hey shorty, I know you wanna party
The way your body look it make me really feel naughty
Cutie cutie, make sure you move your booty
Shake that thing like we in the city of sin, and
Hey shorty, I know you wanna party
The way your body look it make me really feel naughty

I got a naughty naughty style and a naughty naughty crew
But everything I do, I do just for you
I'm a little bit of old, and a bigger bit of new
The true niggers know that the peas come through
We never cease (NO), we never die no we never decease (NO)
We multiply like we mathamatice
Then we drop bombs like we in the Middle East
(The bomb bombas, the base move dramas)
Naw y'all know, who we are
Y'all know, we the stars
Steady rockin' on y'alls boulevards
And lookin' hard without bodyguards
(I do) what I can
(Y'all come through) will.i.am
And still I stand, with still mic in hand
(So come on mama, dance to the drama)

Hey mama, this that shit that make you groove, mama
(Hey) get on the floor and move your booty mama
(Yaw) we the blast mastas blastin' up the jamma
(Hey) so shake your bambama, come on now mama
This that shit that make you groove, mama
(Hey) get on the floor and move your booty mama
(Yaw) we the blast mastas blastin' up the jamma (wow)
(La la la la la)

We the big town stumpas, and big sound pumpas
The beat bump bumps in your trunk trunkas
The girlies in the club with the big plump plumpas
And when I'm makin' love, my hip hump humps
It never quits (NO) we need to carry nine millimeters clips (NO)
Don't wanna squeeze trigger, just wanna squeeze tits
(lover lover) cause we the show stoppas
And the chief rockas, number one chief rockas

Naw y'all know, who we are
Y'all know, we the stars
Steady rockin' on y'alls boulevards
How we rockin' it girl, without body guards
Now she be, Fergie, from the crew
B.E.P., come and take heed, as we take the lead
(So come on papa, dance to the drama)

Hey mama, this that shit that make you groove, mama
(Yaw) get on the floor and move your booty mama
(Wuh) we the blast mastas blastin' up the jamma
(NAW, NAW)
Cutie cutie, make sure you move your booty
Shake that thing we're in the city of sin,
And hey shorty, I know you wanna party
And the way your body look it make me really feel naughty
But the race is not for the swift
But for who can control it
And tippa irie and the black eyed peas will be there
Til infinity, til infinity, til infinity, til infinity, til infinity
Blacked out

Nosa dima shock, nosa dima ting
Every time you sit there I hear, bling bling
O wata ting, hear blacka sing
Grinding, and winding
And the madda be moving in a perfect timing
And we dance and dance to the dance-hall riddim
And we're really to nice, it finga lickin'
Like rice and peas and chicken stuffing

Hey mama, this that shit that make you groove, mama
(Hey) get on the floor and move your booty mama
(Yaw) we the blast mastas blastin' up the jamma
(Hey) so shake your bambama, come on now mama
Go get it
Hey mama, this that shit that make you groove, mama
(Hey) get on the floor and move your booty mama
(Yaw) we the blast mastas blastin' up the jamma
(La la la la la )
