Don't bother cryin', don't bother crawlin'
It's all over now, no use in stallin'
The love I once felt
I don't feel anymore for you
This time I'll even open the door for you
You walked out when I was down
Well, now I'm well off
And look, look who's comin' 'round

Where were you when I needed ya?
Where were you when I wanted ya?
Where were you when I needed ya?
Where?

Oh, you're lookin' good
It's hard to fight it
But no use explainin'
I've already decided
That livin' with you
Is worse than without ya
I won't spend a lifetime a-worryin' about ya
Oh, things got rough and you disappeared
Now, I'm back on my feet
But look, look who's standing there

Where were you when I needed ya?
Where were you when I wanted ya?
Where were you when I needed ya?
Where?

Oh, you were so young and you were so wild
I knew you were nobody's innocent child
That first day I saw ya
You really got to me
I thought I could change ya
What good did it do me?
Oh, things got rough and you wouldn't wait
Now, you're trippin' back
But babe, babe it's too late

Where were you when I needed ya?
Where were you when I wanted ya?
Where were you when I needed ya?
Where?

Where were you when I needed ya?
Where were you when I wanted ya?
Where were you when I needed ya?
