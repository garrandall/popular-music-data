She walks down the street a-knockin' 'em dead
Store window dummies even turn their heads
Sho' 'nuff, powerful stuff
When I saw her I burned my black book
Made a blind man take a second look
Sho' 'nuff I think I'm in love
And that's powerful stuff

Naugahyde skirt, black stacked heels
Red copper head, dig the wig it's unreal
Sho' 'nuff, powerful stuff
Ole man Atlas holding up the world
He'd drop everything for that girl
Sho' 'nuff, I think I'm in love
And it's powerful stuff

Her hip shakin' whip snakin' cooked my goose
I tell you that babe she's a fine papoose
I love her mind, but here's the deal
She's got the kind of girl who rides the manmobile

She opens her eyes and turns on the juice
Pulls 'em like a magnet and she don't turn loose
Sho' 'nuff, powerful stuff
When she starts rockin', don't touch that dial
She's a hundred-mega-kilowatts of woman, child
Sho' 'nuff, I think I'm in love
Think I'm in love, I think I'm in love
And that's powerful stuff
