I came to see her dad for a sit down man to man
Wasn't any secret, I'd be asking for her hand
I guess that's why he left me waiting in the living room by myself
With at least a dozen pictures of her sitting on a shelf, she was

She was playin' Cinderella
She was ridin' her first bike
Bouncing on the bed and looking for a pillow fight
Runnin' through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
Dancin' with her dad, lookin' up at him
In her eyes I'm prince Charming but to him I'm just some fellow
Ridin' in and stealing Cinderella

I leaned in towards those pictures
To get a better look at one
When I heard a voice behind me say
"Now, ain't she somethin' son?"
I said "Yeah, she's quite a woman"
And he just stared at me
And I realized that in his eyes she would always be

Playin' Cinderella
Ridin' her first bike
Bouncing on the bed and looking for a pillow fight
Runnin' through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
Dancin' with her dad, lookin' up at him
In her eyes I'm prince Charming but to him I'm just some fellow
Ridin' in and stealing Cinderella

Oh, he slapped me on the shoulder
Then he called her in the room
When she threw her arms around him
That's when I could see it too

She was playin' Cinderella, ridin' her first bike
Bouncin' on the bed and looking for a pillow fight
Runnin' through the sprinklers with a big popsicle grin
Dancin' with her dad, lookin' up at him
If he gives me a hard time
I can't blame the fellow
I'm the one who's stealing Cinderella
