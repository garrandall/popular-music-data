This is my song for real, no doubt (oh)
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
(Feeling thugged out here)
As I walk you to the dance floor (oh)
We begin to dance slow (yeah)
Put your arms around me
I'm feeling on your booty


Hey pretty mama, how you doing?
Said I'm just in town for the weekend
Looking for a little trouble to get into
Baby, tell me what you're drinking
And I got you, oh


Playas wanna play
Ballers wanna ball (oh yeah)
Rollers wanna roll
But I'm taking off after I dance, oh yeah


This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
(I'm feeling thugged out, oh yeah)
As I walk you to the dance floor
We begin to dance slow
Put your arms around me
I'm feeling on your booty (this is my song, oh)
This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
(Feeling thugged out, yeah)
As I walk you to the dance floor
We begin to dance slow (oh)
Put your arms around me
I'm feeling on your booty


Now you're body's got me feeling like spending
With a back room I could come to live in
And your hair weave's looking kind of purty
The way you back it up on me baby
Lord have mercy


Playas wanna play (um)
Ballers wanna ball (ballers wanna ball)
Rollers wanna roll
But I'm taking off after I dance, oh yeah


This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
(I'm feeling thugged out, oh yeah)
As I walk you to the dance floor
We begin to dance slow (oh
Put your arms around me
I'm feeling on your booty (this is my song, oh yeah)
This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's (I'm feeling) making me feel thugged out (thugged out)
As I walk you to the dance floor (dance floor)
We begin to dance slow (we'll dance)
Put your arms around me (oh yeah)
I'm feeling on your booty


If it's your birthday
Then put your hands up
You wanna get drunk
Then put your hands up
And if you got some cash
Then put your hands up
Have your own job
Put your hands up


Playas wanna play
Ballers wanna ball (ballers wanna ball)
Rollers wanna roll
Feels so good, say it again
Playas wanna play
Ballers wanna ball
Rollers wanna roll
But I'm taking off after I dance, oh yeah


This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out (feeling thugged out)
As I walk you to the dance floor (walk you to the)
We begin to dance slow (we begin to)
Put your arms around me (put your arms a-, oh)
I'm feeling on your booty
This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out (feel thugged out)
As I walk you to the dance floor (walk you to the dance floor)
We begin to dance slow
Put your arms around me
I'm feeling on your booty
(Feeling on yo booty, yes am I)
This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
(And I hope you like it, girl)
As I walk you to the dance floor (walk you to the dance)
We begin to dance slow (we begin to dance)
Put your arms around me (put your arms around)
I'm feeling on your booty
This is my song for real, no doubt
(Feeling on your booty, your booty)
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out (booty, your boo)
As I walk you to the dance floor
(Feeling on your booty, your booty)
We begin to dance slow
Put your arms around me (your boo-ooty, your boo-ooty)
I'm feeling on your booty
This is my song for real, no doubt (boo-oo-oo-oo-ty, boo-oooty)
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
(Boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-booty, boo-booty hahahaha)
As I walk you to the dance floor
We begin to dance slow
Put your arms around me
I'm feeling on your booty
