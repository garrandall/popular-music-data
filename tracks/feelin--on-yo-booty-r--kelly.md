Damn,This sound real familiar
This sound real familiar

 What remix is this?
Feeling on yo booty 

 V.I.P. Wit all ma thugs 
Henessey niggas at the club 
Drop top V. rollin on dubs
Chicken heads showin nothin but love
So much booty (heads in the air like what the awh
D.J's say this mix is the cut cause we be on the flo like we some rugs 
Come here girl( give daddy hug)
Don't play me (Like I'm one of these scubs)
Girl if you don't get yo ass over here and get yo ass in this tub
So much booty (see I ain't drunk but I'm real nice nigga high
like a real kite yall know this remix is real tight.



 I gotta whole block of girl at ma crib 
I'm over by the pool drinking Belvedear
Ain't no haters up in here
Cuz brought that thang down here
So much booty
Thats all I see from the front to the rear 
Socks and house shoes wit Polo gear
500 to the biggest booty in here
Come here girl(give daddy hug)
Don't Play me like I'm one of these scubs
Girl if you don't get yo ass over here and get yo ass in this tub
So much booty
We lookin out from the hill now
Kelly makin a kill now
What's that I wanna feel now



Radio stations, Radio stations, Radio stations, Radio stations
You're getting sleepy
lady
D.J's in the, D.J's in the, D.J's in the, 
D.J's in the bumpin in the club everywhere



Feelin on yo booty, yo booty,
yo booty, yo boo-oo
Feelin on yo booty,yo booty, yo booty,yo booty
yo boocka boo-ooty, booty
