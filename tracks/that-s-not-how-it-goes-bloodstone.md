Say it isn't so
That's not how it goes
Everyone knew but me
That's not how it's
Supposed to be

Maybe someday I'll find
Some kind of peace of mind

Say it isn't so
That's not how
It's supposed to go
Everyone knew but me
That's not how it's
Supposed to be

We're gonna have a baby
It's all right
Every day, every night

Mommy and daddy
Sounds all up to me

Thought that I wouldn't understand
But I'll always be the best I can
From now on, just let me know
That's how it's supposed to go

Cause you're my love
You're my wife
You're my one and only

Say it isn't so
That's not how
It's supposed to go
Everyone knew but me

We are gonna have a baby
It's all right
Every day, every night

It's all right
It's all right with me
Gonna have a baby
Ooh wee, gonna have a baby
Oh, me, oh, my...
