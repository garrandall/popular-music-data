Moving forward using all my breath
Making love to you was never second best
I saw the world crashing all around your face
Never really knowing it was always
Mesh and lace


I'll stop the world and melt with you
You've seen the difference
And it's getting better all the time
There's nothing you and I won't do
I'll stop the world and melt with you


(You should know better)
Dream of better lives
The kind which never hate
(You should see why)
Dropped in the state of imaginary grace

(You should know better)
I made a pilgrimage
To save this human race
(You should see why)
Never comprehending
The race was long, long lost


I'll stop the world and melt with you
(I'll stop the world)
You've seen the difference
And it's getting better all the time

(I'll stop the world)
There's nothing you and I won't do
(Let's stop the world)
I'll stop the world and melt with you

The future's open wide


(Let's stop the world)
I'll stop the world and melt with you
(Let's stop the world)
I've seen some changes
But it's getting better all the time

(Let's stop the world)
There's nothing you and I won't do
(Let's stop the world)
I'll stop the world and melt with you

The future's open wide
Hm hm hm
Hm hm hm hm
Hm hm hm
Hm hm hm hm


I'll stop the world and melt with you
(Let's stop the world)
You've seen the difference
And it's getting better all the time
(Let's stop the world)
There's nothing you and I won't do
(Let's stop the world)

I'll stop the world and melt with you
(Let's stop the world)
I'll stop the world and melt with you
(Let's stop the world)
I'll stop the world and melt with you
(Let's stop the world)
I'll stop the world and melt with you
