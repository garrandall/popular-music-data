If you could see me now
The one who said that he'd rather roam
The one who said he'd rather be alone
If you could only see me now

If I could hold you now
Just for a moment
If I could make you mine
Just for a while
Turn back the hands of time
If I could only hold you now

(CHORUS)
I've been too long in the wind
Too long in the rain
Taking any comfort that I can
Looking back and longing
For the freedom of my chains
Lying in your loving arms again

If you could hear me now
Singing somewhere
Through a lonely night
Dreaming of the arms
That held me tight
If you could only hear me now

(CHORUS)
