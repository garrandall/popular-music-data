So glad we've got a good thing
You know you make my heart sing
You are the real thing
You know you make my heart sing

I've longed to have this chance
With you, I feel romance
It's all for love and I want it bad

Seeing you is just a turn on
And loving you, I want to hold on
There's a feeling in my heart
That just won't let you go

I'll hold on, I'll keep on
(I'm holdin' on)
I'll keep on, I'll hold on
(I'm holdin' on)
I'll hold on, I'll keep on
I'll hold on to your love

So glad we've got a good thing
You know you make my heart sing
You are the real thing
You know you make my heart sing

So glad we've got a good thing
You know you make my heart sing
You are the real thing
You know you make my heart sing

Seeing you is just a turn on
Loving you, I want to hold on
There's a feeling in my heart
That just won't let you go

I'll hold on, I'll keep on
(I'm holdin' on)
I'll keep on, I'll hold on
(I'm holdin' on)
I'll hold on, I'll keep on
I'll hold on to your love

So glad we've got a good thing
You know you make my heart sing
You are the real thing
You know you make my heart sing

So glad we've got a good thing
You know you make my heart sing
You are the real thing
You know you make my heart sing

So glad we've got a good thing
You know you make my heart sing
You are the real thing
You know you make my heart sing

So glad we've got a good thing
You know you make my heart sing
You are the real thing
You know you make my heart sing

So glad we've got a good thing
