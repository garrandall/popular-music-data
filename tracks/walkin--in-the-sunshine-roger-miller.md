Walking In the Sunshine, sing a little sunshine song 
Put a smile upon your face as if there's nothing wrong 
Think about a good time had a long time ago 
Think about forgetting about your worries and your woes 
Walking In The Sunshine, sing a little sunshine song 

La la la la la dee oh, 
Whether the weather be rain or snow 
Pretending can make it real 
A snowy pasture, a green and grassy field 

Walking In the Sunshine, sing a little sunshine song 
Put a smile upon your face as if there's nothing wrong 
Think about a good time had a long time ago 
Think about forgetting about your worries and your woes 
Walking In The Sunshine, sing a little sunshine song 

La la la la la dee oh, 
Whether the weather be rain or snow 
Pretending can make it real 
A snowy pasture, a green and grassy field 

Walking In the Sunshine, sing a little sunshine song 
Put a smile upon your face as if there's nothing wrong 
Think about a good time had a long time ago 
Think about forgetting about your worries and your woes 
Walking In The Sunshine, sing a little sunshine song 

Walking In the Sunshine, singing a little sunshine song 
Put a smile upon your face as if there's nothing wrong
