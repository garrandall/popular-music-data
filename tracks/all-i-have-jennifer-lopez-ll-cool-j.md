Guess who
J to the Lo
F to the 'ab'
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
I'm ain't Mr. Right, I'm Mr. Right Now (Oh!)
I keep women in thongs comin' along (Oh!)
Invisibly set stones, some of them prone
I can tell you ain't never had someone this long
One night, have them bumpin' my song like 'mmm, mmm' girl
You ain't know I was comin' this strong
Now you know not to come at me wrong
I get right, uh


You lookin' just a little too hard at me
Standin' just a little too close to me
You sayin' 'Not quite in love' to me
You sippin' just a little too slow for me
No doubt you're playin' real cool homey
Got me thinkin' what is it you do for me
Trippin' (trippin') a little more than I should be
So let yourself go and get right with me!


I'm about to sign you up
We can get right before the night is up
We can get right, get right
We can get right, get right
We can get right

I'm about to fill your cup
We can get right before the night is up
We can get right, get right, tonight
We can get right


Your lips talkin' about I play too much
Can't a woman take advantage of what she wants?
My hips movin' oh so slow (so slow)
Bar tab lookin' like a car note (car note)
All I need is you here right by my side
Take whatever you want baby let's ride
And whatever you want you let me decide
Just put your name on the dotted line

I'm about to sign you up
We can get right before the night is up
We can get right, get right
We can get right, get right
We can get right

I'm about to fill your cup
We can get right before the night is up
We can get right, get right, tonight
We can get right


So much we got to say, but so little time
And if tonight ain't long enough, don't leave love behind
Baby take my hand I'll show you why

I'm about to sign you up
We can get right before the night is up
We can get right, get right
We can get right, get right
We can get right

I'm about to fill your cup
We can get right before the night is up (Oh, oh, oh)
We can get right, get right, tonight (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
We can get right


It's slim with the tilted rim on 20 inch rims
Rock up wrist watch, 6 inch Timbs
Button-up shirt cuffed with the French trim
So you can tell a man get to the right (Oh)
I'm in the driver's seat, you sit to the right
And this is just to get to the flight
I like the way it fit to you tight
So I'mma show you the world in a day for you
Even get to the night
I'm lookin' for a dime, but I don't need a penny though
Any old wannabe Jenny-Lo, no!
Plenty dough and there's plenty more where it come from
I'm the Real Talk where I come from, Oh!


I'm about to sign you up
We can get right before the night is up
We can get right, get right
We can get right, get right
We can get right

I'm about to fill your cup
We can get right before the night is up
We can get right, get right, tonight
We can get right

I'm about to sign you up
We can get right before the night is up
We can get right, get right
We can get right, get right
We can get right

I'm about to fill your cup
We can get right before the night is up
We can get right, get right
