Two worlds collide, rival nations
It's a primitive clash venting years of frustrations
Bravely we hope against all hope
There is so much at stake
Seems our freedom's up against the ropes
Does the crowd understand?
Is it East versus West or man against man?
Can any nation stand alone?


In the burning Heart just about to burst
There's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night rising like a spire
In the burning heart the unmistakable fire


In the warriors code there's no surrender
Though his body says stop his spirit cries - never!
Deep in our soul a quiet ember knows it's you against you
It's the paradox that drives us on
It's a battle of wills
In the heat of attack it's the passion that kills
The victory is yours alone


In the burning Heart just about to burst
There's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night rising like a spire
In the burning heart the unmistakable fire

In the burning Heart just about to burst
There's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night rising like a spire
In the burning heart the unmistakable fire
In the burning Heart just about to burst
There's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night rising like a spire
In the burning heart the unmistakable fire


In the burning heart
