A gypsy wind is blowin' warm tonight
The sky is starlit and the time is right
And still you're tellin' me you have to go
Before you leave there's something you should know
Yeah something you should know babe
I've seen you smilin' in the summer sun
I've seen your long hair flying when you run
I've made my mind up that it's meant to be
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me


Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Out where the rivers meet the soundin' sea
You're high above me now, you're wild and free
Ah but someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me


Some people say that love's a losin' game
You start with fire but you lose the flame
The ashes smolder but the warmth's soon gone
You end up cold and lonely on your own
I'll take my chances babe, I'll risk it all
I'll win your love or I'll take the fall
I've made my mind up girl it's meant to be
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me


Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
It's written down somewhere, it's got to be
You're high above me flyin' wild and free
Oh but someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Out where the rivers meet the sounding sea
I feel it in my soul, it's meant to be
Ohh someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
