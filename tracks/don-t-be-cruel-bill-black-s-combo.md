You know I can be found
Sitting home all alone
If you can't come around
At least please telephone
Dont be cruel to a heart thats true
Baby, if I made you mad
For something I might have said
Please, lets forget the past
The future looks bright ahead
Dont be cruel to a heart thats true
I don't want no other love
Baby its just you Im thinking of
Dont stop thinking of me
Dont make me feel this way
Come on over here and love me
You know what I want you to say
Dont be cruel to a heart thats true
Why should we be apart?
I really love you baby, cross my heart
Lets walk up to the preacher
And let us say I do
Then youll know youll have me
And Ill know that Ill have you
Dont be cruel to a heart thats true
I don't want no other love
Baby its just you Im thinking of
Dont be cruel to a heart thats true
Dont be cruel to a heart thats true
I don't want no other love
Baby its just you Im thinking of
