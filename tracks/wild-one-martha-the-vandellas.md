Wild one, wild one
Wild one, you're a rebel
And they say you're just no good
But they might change their mind
If they only understood
Wild one, I understand
I know you've never had a chance
You're a victim of circumstance

Can't you see
Just where you stand with me
I've given you my heart
I've given it to you
Don't you know where you go
I will follow you
So fight if you want to
And go where you want to
Be wild as can be
But save your love for me
Save your love for me

Wild one, just let them talk
Be what you want to be
Forget your love for me
And find security
Wild one, you know that in my heart
You're the only one
No matter what you've done

Can't you see
Just here you stand with me
I've given you my heart
I've given you my heart
Don't you know where you go
I will follow you
So fight if you want to
And go where you want to
Be wild as can be
But save your love for me
Save your love for me
