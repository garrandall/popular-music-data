You made a fool out of me girl
But that made me the man
I was trying to be girl
You done me wrong, yes you did now
But you only made me strong
Yes you did girl, tell me now

Can you handle it?
See what you did to me
Can you handle it?
Can you handle it?
You made it what it is
Can you handle it?

Yes, you made a fool out of me girl
To the things I was blind you made me see girl
My heart feels no pain
If there's anyone to blame
It's you, it's you, it's you girl
Tell me now

Can you handle it?
See what you did to me
Can you handle it?
Can you handle it?
You made it what it is
Can you handle it?
Now can you handle it?
See what you did?
Can you handle it?

See what you did?
Can you handle it?
See what you did?
Can you handle it?
See what you did?

You made a fool out of me girl
But that made me the man
I was trying to be girl
My heart feels no pain
If there's anyone to blame
It's you, it's you, it's you girl

Now can you handle it?
Can you handle it?
Now can you handle it?
Can you handle it?
