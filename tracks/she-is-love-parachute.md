I've been beaten down, I've been kicked around
But she takes it all for me
And I lost my faith, in my darkest days
But she makes me want to believe


They call her love, love, love, love, love
They call her love, love, love, love, love
She is love, and she is all I need

She's all I need


Well I had my ways, they were all in vain
But she waited patiently
It was all the same, all my pride and shame
And she put me on my feet


[They call her love, love, love, love, love
They call her love, love, love, love, love
She is love, and she is all I need


And when that world slows down, dear
And when those stars burn out, here
Oh she'll be here, yes she'll be here


[They call her love, love, love, love, love
They call her love, love, love, love, love
She is love, and she is all I need


[They call her love, love, love, love, love
They call her love, love, love, love, love
She is love, and she is all I need


[They call her love, love, love, love, love
They call her love, love, love, love, love
She is love, and she is all I need
