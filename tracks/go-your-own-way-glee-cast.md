Loving you
Isnât the right thing to do
How can I ever change things
That I feel

If I could
Maybe Iâd give you my world
How can I
When you wonât take it from me

You can go your own way
Go your own way
You can call it
Another lonely day
You can go your own way
Go your own way

Tell me why
Everything turned around
Packing up,
Shacking upâs all you wanna do

If I could
Baby Iâd give you my world
Open up
Everythingâs waiting for you

You can go your own way
Go your own way
You can call it
Another lonely day
You can go your own way
Go your own way
