Loving you, isn't the right thing to do
How can I, ever change things that I feel?
If I could, maybe I'd give you my world
How can I, when you won't take it from me?


(You can go your own way) Go your own way
(You can call it another lonely day) Another lonely day
(You can go your own way) Go your own way


Tell me why, everything turned around?
Packing up, shacking up, is all you wanna do
If I could, baby, I'd give you my world
Open up, everything's waiting for you
Ohh


(You can go your own way) Go your own way
(You can call it another lonely day) Another lonely day
(You can go your own way) Go your own way


Oh-heey!


(You can go your own way) Go your own way
(You can call it another lonely day) Another lonely day
(You can go your own way) Go your own way
(You can call it another lonely day)


Oh OOhOhOh


Oh
You can go, you can go
Oh (You can call it another lonely day)
Call it another lonely day, yeah (You can go your own way)
Go your own way
