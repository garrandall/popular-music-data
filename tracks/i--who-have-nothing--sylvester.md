You
I need you
Oh, you
I need you

You're my friend, and my lover
You thrill me through and through
Oh, and since you squeezed me
No other arms can do, love

Oh, how I need you
Oh, how I need you
Oh, how I need you, oh

So delighted
You make me feel brand new
I am so excited
Say you need me too

(Oh, how I need you) oh, how I need you
(Oh, how I need you) oh...

You

Oh, you

Oh, you (oh yeah)

Oh, you (oh you, you)

Yeah, I need you, yeah
Oh, I need you, yeah

You, you-u

I need you (I need you), you-u
Oh, I need you so, I need you-u
I need you, you-u
