There's a train leaving here tomorrow
And I'll be a free man once again
I'm so glad I served my time
I'm going to meet the girl that I left behind


And when I see her
I'm going to give her all the love I've got
When I see her
I'm going to give her all the love I've got


There were times
When each day seemed like a year
But the sweet things she said in the letters
Made the time just disappear
She said no other arms will I let hold me
Because in your arms is where I want to be


And when I see her
I'm going to give her all the love I've got
When I see her
I'm going to give her all the love I've got


Baby, oh baby, my little darling
I'm coming home


The nights I've stared out my window at the moonlight
Thinking about the way I used to hold her tight
I must have been out of my mind to do the wrong I did
And leave her behind


And when I see her
I'm going to give her all the love I've got
When I see her
I'm going to give her all the love I've got
