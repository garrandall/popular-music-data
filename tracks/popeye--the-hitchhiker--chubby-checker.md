Standing on the side of the street
Uh huh
Hitchhike
Hitchhike
Popeye
Clapping both his hand to the beat
Oh yeah

Tryin' hard to bum a ride
Popeye
Tryin' but none come around
They go by
Hey

Well now clap your hands
And thumb your thumbs
That's how the popeye dance is done
Popeye
Standing there and it's gettin' cold
Oh yeah
Hitchhike 
Hitchhike
Popeye
Shakin' now to warm up his soul
Uh huh
Hitchhike 
Hitchhike
Hey
Popeye
Double turn and with the thumb
Popeye
Tryin' but nobody comes
They go by
Hey
Popeye

Well now clap your hands
And thumb your thumbs
That's how the popeye dance is done
Yeah

Popeye
Standin' there and it's gettin' late
Oh yeah
Hitchhike 
Hitchhike
Popeye
Dancin' there and he's movin' great
Oh yeah
Hitchhike 
Hitchhike

Popeye
She's a gorgeous chick all fine
She just stops and hollers hi
That lucky guy
Don't cha know
Popeye

Well now clap your hands
And thumb your thumbs
That's how the popeye dance is done
Fly
Hey
