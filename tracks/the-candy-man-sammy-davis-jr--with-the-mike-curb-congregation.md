Candy Man, hey Candy Man
Alright everybody, gather around
The Candy Man is here
What kind of candy do you want?
Sweet chocolate? Chocolate walnut candy?
Gum drops? Anything you want
You've come to the right man because
I'm the Candy Man


Who can take a sunrise?
(Who can take a sunrise?)
Sprinkle it with dew
(Sprinkle it with dew)
Cover it with chocolate and a miracle or two

The Candy Man (the candy man)
The Candy Man can (the candy man can)
The Candy Man can 'cause he mixes it with love
And makes the world taste good
(Makes the world taste good)

Who can take the rainbow?
(Who can take the rainbow?)
Wrap it in a sigh
(Wrap it in a sigh)
Soak it in the sun and make a groovy lemon pie

The Candy Man (the candy man)
The Candy Man can (the candy man can)
The Candy Man can 'cause he mixes it with love
And makes the world taste good
(Makes the world taste good)


The Candy Man makes everything he bakes
Satisfying and delicious
Now, you talk about your childhood wishes
You can even eat the dishes


Oh, who can take tomorrow?
(Who can take tomorrow?)
Dip it in a dream
(Dip it in a dream)
Separate the sorrow and collect up all the cream

The Candy Man (the candy man)
The Candy Man can (the candy man can)
The Candy Man can 'cause he mixes it with love
And makes the world taste good
(Makes the world taste good)


The Candy Man makes everything he bakes
Satisfying and delicious
Talk about your childhood wishes
You can even eat the dishes


Yeah, yeah, yeah, who can take tomorrow?
(Who can take tomorrow?)
Dip it in a dream
(Dip it in a dream)
Separate the sorrow and collect up all the cream

The Candy Man (the candy man)
The Candy Man can (the candy man can)
The Candy Man can 'cause he mixes it with love
And makes the world taste good
(Makes the world taste good)

Yes, the Candy Man can 'cause he mixes it with love
And makes the world taste good
(Makes the world taste good)


A candy man, a candy man, a candy man
Makes the world taste good
A candy man, a candy man, a candy man
Makes the world taste good
A candy man, a candy man
