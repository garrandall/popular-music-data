You may dismiss me as unimportant
A guy who's only in the corner of your eye
Right now I know I'm just a?
I'm just an easy friend on whom you can depend

But darling, there will come a day
Oh, when you look at me, my baby, another way
While you're relaxing, I'm gonna happen to you
Oh

Oh baby, oh baby
Ew oh oh baby
Yeah

I only see you in little glimpses
We work together in a world of?
I'm only dreamin' of champagne kisses
You pass right by me, honey

But girl, there will come a day, baby
When you look at me, my baby, another way
While you're relaxing, I'm gonna happen to you
You, you

There will come a great big day, yeah
When you look at me, my baby, another way
There will come day, baby
Look at me, look at me

There will come a time, baby
When I'll be yours, you'll be mine, baby

There will come
