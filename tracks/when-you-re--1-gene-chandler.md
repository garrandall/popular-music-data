On the Southside of Chicago
Bobby boogie as the people
Watch him dance step on the floor
Ain't no match, you can
Catch him some night dancing
And the people in the disco
Cheer for more
And the music's fine
He's the greatest dance star
He'll blow your mind
Well, it's hard to stay on top
When you can't stop, no
You're number one, yeah
You're number one, yeah
You know, yeah
You're number one, yeah
Now Jimmy's dressed in satin
Laced with diamonds
And he has moves just like
A tiger in the night
In every disco up in Frisco
They're dancing
His moves are strong
To every song
And the number one
He had to know
So he challenged Bobby
On a TV show
Like the?, got the stuff
Got to show your stuff, yeah
When you're number one, yeah
You're number one, yeah
You know, yeah
You're number one, yeah
People cleared the floor
To let the dance begin
Bobby moved and glided
I thought his moves
Would never end
Jimmy turned and twisted
As the ladies watched him dance
His feet, they weaved
That magic spell
Put the crowd out in a trance
Everybody, everybody was looking
The music, the music, the music
The music was cooking
Those fast feet
Hips and hands were moving
And somehow when that
Smoke got cleared away
Jimmy was on the floor dancing
And Bobby had simply
Faded away
So if you think
That you're number one
You can't claim the title
Til the dance is done
You're always gonna
Make yourself a target
To every new kid
Who comes to town
He's waiting to meet you
At some disco
When you're number one
They try to shoot you down
When you're number one, yeah
You're number one, yeah
You know, yeah
You're number one, yeah
