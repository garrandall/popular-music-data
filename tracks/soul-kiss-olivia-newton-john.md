There are nights when you're as mean
As a ladder with a broken rung
When I know your sorry won't make it
From your heart to your tongue
And there are nights when you keep pushing me
And I won't go on
Cause when I get mad enough darling
I will be standing my ground

But on a night like this I know I can't win
I know my soul will burn and blister
When you slide your silky whisper under my skin
Oh under my skin
When you slide your silky whisper under my skin

There are nights when every kiss
Is an order than I can't obey
And I can taste the lie coming
From a mile away
There are nights when you keep holding me
But your arms are too tight
And I don't need what I want
Cause what I want just don't feel right

But on a night like this I know I can't win
I know my soul will burn and blister
When you slide your silky whisper under my skin
Oh under my skin
When you slide your silky whisper under my skin

Everywhere that I go, I hear your name
Spoken in whispers, spoken in shame
In shame

But on a night like this I know I can't win
I know my soul will burn and blister
When you slide your silky whisper under my skin
Yeah under my skin
Come and slide your whisper under my skin
Oh under my skin
Come and slide your whisper under my skin
Under my skin
Ooh under my skin

Come and slide your whisper (under my skin)
