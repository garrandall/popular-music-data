She doesn't really want things 
That you can never get
Still every now and then
Maybe she'll complain a bit
Because she feels upset

She only wants you 
To tell her that you love her
So if she wants you 
To turn winter into Spring
Promise her anything 
She's dreaming of
Promise her anything 
She will be happy 
If she only gets your love

Oh you can promise her the moon 
When the sun is bright
Promise her the sun 
When you're out of sight
Promise her the world 
And promise her 
Her every wish is your command
And you'll discover soon, 
She doesn't want the moon
Just love will do

Promise her anything 
But don't you ever
Let her get away from you
