CMB, we in the buildin' Swag Out 100.


Always Strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me dap, bitches give me hugs
& since I'm paid, niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back.
Yes sir.

Check me out, look
26 inches, bitch I'm sittin' crooked
Old school Chevy, faster than a silver bullet
Strawberry paint, seats vanilla puddin'
2 bitches, gon' & eat each other's pussy.

Top chopped sent the car to the barbershop
My driveway looks somethin' like a parkin' lot
I'm so unothodox
I got your bitch Ridin' my dick wit no shocks.
Bounce bitch, bounce, bounce.

I'm the hottest shit jumpin' out the coffet pot
Man, I'm just tryin' to get my spot like a polka dot
Lil' kush make my eyes & my shoulders drop
Lil' syrup & I can make a soda pop.

Keep talkin' 'n' I can make my soldiers pop
Real niggas wit me ridin' till the motor stop
I got these hoes straight livin' out the soap op
I got a couple like a coke top.
Okay?

Always Strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me daps, bitches give me hugs
& since I'm paid, niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm

Always Strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me daps, bitches give me hugs
& since I'm paid, bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back
Bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back.


I'm Mack Maine, hey
Hey, to a man with a hoe with some pop trunk
I fuck over you like I'm sexin' on the top bunk
I make alot of noise, boy, like a cop car
The whip got the dicks out like a pop bra
& you ain't gotta ask your girl... you knew she knew me
From ring tones she sing my songs at the karaoke
She call me baby all day like I'm Bryan Williams
The new hip-hop landlord I'm 'bout to buy the buildin'
& I'm evictin' all you cats that only spit an ounce
& like a stripper ass you better bounce diggity, bounce, bounce.

Always Strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me dap, bitches give me hugs
& since I'm paid niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm

Always strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me dap, bitches give me hugs
& since I'm paid, bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back
Bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back.

Yeah Shawty The Last MOB Flyin' The Mo' Gotti With The Tool On The Seat.


Put the K in the car while we ridin' blaze
Put the chopper on the pussy in the driveway.
Bet the house on the young 'un when we got paid.
Triple colors on the bikes in the new mercaids.
Bustin' keys on they ass while we got paid.
From I-10's ridin' hot to an open bay,
Uptown made man out the hard way
Crab in the bucket 50 shots bitch make a way.
I Thought They Knew Shawty
Like Father Like Son
Ball till you fall stuntin' wit them paper plates,
Throwin' hundreds on them hoes while we eatin' stakes.
We in the club poppin' bottles like everyday.
We grind for the shine nigga gettin' big money.
Got a fleet tossin' chicken nigga get cake
I'm on his island with this power like Scarface.
I'm in the Impala dropped top chawwnky
Ice man birdman rockin' red monkeys.

Already Nigga Nieghborhood Super Star
& We Gon' Ball 'Til We Fall.

Always Strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me dap, bitches give me hugs
& since I'm paid, niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm

Always Strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me dap, bitches give me hugs
& since I'm paid, bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back
Bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back.
