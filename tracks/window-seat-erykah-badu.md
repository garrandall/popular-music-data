So, presently
I'm standing here right now
You're so demanding
Tell me what you want from me

Concluding, concentrating
On my music, lover and my babies
Makes me wanna ask the lady
For a ticket outta town

So can I get a window seat?
Don't want nobody next to me
I just want a ticket outta town
A look around and a safe touch down

Can I get a window seat?
Don't want nobody next to me
I just want a chance to fly
A chance to cry and a long bye-bye

But I need you to want me
Need you to miss me
I need your attention
I need you next me

I need someone to clap for me
I need your direction
Somebody say, come back
Come back, baby, come back
I want you to need me

Come back, come back, baby, come back
Come back, come back, baby, come back
Come back, come back, baby, come back

So, in my mind I'm tusslin'
Back and forth 'tween here and hustlin'
I don't wanna time travel no more
I wanna be here, I'm thinking

On this porch I'm rockin'
Back and forth like Lightning Hopkins
If anybody speak to Scotty
Tell him, beam me up

So can I get a window seat?
Don't want nobody next to me
I just want a ticket outta town
A look around and a safe touch down

Can I get a window seat?
Don't want nobody next to me
I just want a chance to fly
A chance to cry and a long bye-bye

But I need you to miss me
Need somebody come get me
I need your attention
Need your energy, yes, I do

I need someone to clap for me
I need your direction
Somebody say, come back
Come back, baby, come back
I want you to need me

Come back, come back, baby, come back
Come back, come back, baby, come back
Come back, come back, baby, come back

But can I get a window seat?
Don't want nobody next to me
I just want a ticket outta town
A look around and a safe touch down

I just need a chance to fly
A chance to cry and a long bye-bye
