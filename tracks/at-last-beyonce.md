At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
Oh yeah yeah

At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you

I found a dream
That I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known

Oh yeah, when you smile
You smile, Ooh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine
At last
