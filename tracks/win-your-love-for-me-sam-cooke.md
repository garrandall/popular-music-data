Wooah ooo little girl
How happy I would be
If some miracle could win your love for me

Wooah ooo little girl
How happy I would be
If some miracle could win your love for me

Win your love for me

Manys the day I've longed for you
To hold you in my arms
Manys the night I've cried for you
And for your many charms

If you'd only come to me my heart wouldn't be full of sorrow
But now all I can do is hope and prey that you will come to me tomorrow

Wooah ooo little girl
How happy I would be
If some miracle could win your love for me

Win your love for me

To me you are so beautiful
Beautiful as a song
Whenever I look at you my heart beat like the tom tom
If you'd only come to me
This torch I wouldn't have to carry
And if everything goes right
To the church we'll go to marry

Wooah ooo little girl
How happy I would be
If some miracle could win your love for me

Win your love for me
