Stroke it for me, stroke it for me
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me


Oh, baby, I love your stroke ('Cause you)
'Cause you get me where I'm going ('Cause you get me where I'm going)
In a jury, you'll get my vote
'Cause I believe
I believe you know just what you doing now

Stroke it for me
Mm, stroke it baby, stroke it baby
Mmm, work it, baby, work it baby
Oh stroke It
There is something I want you to do
I want you to use yourself (Hey)
Like you never ever used to do before (Never)
To explore my body (Explore it, baby)
Until you reach the shore (Yeah)
You'll be calling, calling for more (Calling)


Rock the boat, rock the boat
