The word came to me this morning
They say that you're hot on my trail
You're digging for facts
And you're setting your traps
I tell you babe you're bond to fail
It's not that I'm trying to deceive you
But you tried every trick in the book
You read every line
But you're still one step behind
You better take a second look

You're on the wrong track woman
You're way off your course
Wrong track woman
You're lost
Wrong track woman
You're way off your course
You must have got your signals crossed
You must have got your signals crossed

So climb down off of your high horse
I know that you're destined to fall
You can't understand you've been playing the wrong hand
There's nothing for you here at all
It seems like you're spinning in circles
For the trail's now distant cold
You're losing the race
So why not give up the chase
You're just digging for fools gold

You're on the wrong track woman
You're way off your course
Wrong track woman
You're lost
Wrong track woman
You're way off your course
You must have got your signals crossed
You must have got your signals, must have got your signals, crossed

You're on the wrong track woman
You're way off your course
Wrong track woman
You're lost
Wrong track woman
You're way off your course
You must have got your signals crossed
You must have got your signals, must have got your signals, crossed

Wrong track woman
On the wrong track
You better get back

Wrong track woman
You're on the wrong track
You better get back

Wrong track woman
You're on the wrong track
You better get back
