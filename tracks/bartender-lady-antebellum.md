8 o'clock on Friday night I'm still at home
All my girls just keep on blowing up my phone
Saying come on he ain't worth the pain
Do what you gotta do to forget his name
Now there's only one thing left for me to do
Slip on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots
Check the mirror one last time
And kiss the past goodbye


What I'm really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
Till I don't remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise
In the lights
Hey bartender pour 'em hot tonight
Till the party and music and the truth collide
Bring it till his memory fades away
Hey bartender

Tonight I'll let a stranger pull me on the floor
Spin me round and let 'em buy a couple more
But before it goes too far I'll let him down easy
Cause tonight is all about
Dancing with my girls to the DJ
Put that song on replay


What I'm really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
Till I don't remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise
In the lights
Hey bartender pour 'em hot tonight
Till the party and music and the truth collide
Bring it till his memory fades away
Hey bartender

Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock
Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you to stop
So pour that thing up to the top
I'm coming in hot
Hey Bartender


Oh what I'm really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
Till I don't remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise
In the lights
Hey bartender pour 'em hot tonight
Till the party and music and the truth collide
Bring it till his memory fades away
Hey bartender
Hey bartender
