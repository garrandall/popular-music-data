Could U be the most beautiful girl in the world?
It's plain 2 see U're the reason that God made a girl
When the day turns into the last day of all time
I can say I hope U are in these arms of mine
And when the night falls before that day I will cry
I will cry tears of joy cuz after U all one can do is die, oh

Could U be the most beautiful girl in the world?
Could U be?
It's plain 2 see U're the reason that God made a girl
Oh, yes U are

How can I get through days when I can't get through hours?
I can try but when I do I see U and I'm devoured, oh yes
Who'd allow, who'd allow a face 2 be soft as a flower? Oh
I could bow (bow down) and feel proud in the light of this power
Oh yes, oh

Could U be (could U be) the most beautiful girl in the world?
Could U be?
It's plain 2 see U're the reason that God made a girl
Oh, yes U are

And if the stars ever fell one by one from the sky
I know Mars could not be, uh, 2 far behind
Cuz baby, this kind of beauty has got no reason 2 ever be shy
Cuz honey, this kind of beauty is the kind that comes from inside

Could U be (could U be) the most beautiful girl in the world?
So beautiful, beautiful
It's plain 2 see (plain 2 see) U're the reason that God made a girl

Oh yeah! (Oh, yes U are)
Girl (Could U be?)
U must be ... oh yeah!
(Could U be?)
U're the reason ... oh yeah
(Could)
