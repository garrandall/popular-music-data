This old heart of mine been broke a thousand times
Each time you break away, I fear you've gone to stay
Lonely nights that come, memories that flow, bringing you back again
Hurting me more and more

Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside;
Cause each day that passes by you got me
Never knowing if I'm coming or going, but I, I love you
This old heart darling, is weak for you
I love you, yes, I do
These old arms of mine miss having you around;
Makes these tears inside start a-falling down

Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside;
Cause each day that passes by you got me
Never knowing if I'm coming or going, but I, I love you
This old heart darling, is weak for you
I love you, yes, I do. Yes, I do

I try hard to hide my hurt inside
This old heart of mine always keeps me cryin'
I try hard to hide my hurt inside
This old heart of mine always keeps me cryin' the way you treat me
Leaves me incomplete, you're here for the day, gone for the week, now
But if you leave me a hundred times
A hundred times I'll take you back
I'm yours whenever you want me
I'm not too proud to shout it
Tell the world about it cause I love you
Yes I do. Yes, I do
I love you. This old heart darling is weak for you
