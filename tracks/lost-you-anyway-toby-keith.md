Maybe you were right, Maybe I could have changed 
Sittin' here alone tonight thinkin' 'bout a lot of things 
What's a man to say when all the questions start 
Hell I know deep down inside my broken heart 


Could've tried just a little bit harder 
Kissed you just a little bit sweeter 
Held on just a little bit longer 
Dug down just a little bit deeper 
Let the world revolve around you 
And give you the stars above 
Loved you just enough to make you stay 
And I'd lost you anyway 

I hate it when it's like this, baby it's like that now 
Nothing I can say to you, you even care to talk about 
How you gonna dress it up, wrap it in a pretty bow 
When it's gone, it's gone for good, baby at least I know 



Let the world revolve around you 
And given you the stars above 
Loved you just enough to make you stay 
And I'd lost you anyway
