Oh how happy
You have made me
Oh how happy
You have made me

I have kissed your lips
A thousand times
And more times than I can count
I have called you mine
You have stood by me
In my darkest hours

Sing
Oh how happy
You have made me
Oh how happy
You have made me
Oh how happy
You have made me
Oh how happy
You have made me

In our years together
We've stormy weathers
But our love has been so strong
For some how we carry on

Sing
Oh how happy
You have made me
Oh how happy
You have made me
Ooh, ooh

You brought joy
To my empty life, yeah
And all that was wrong
You made it right
Our love
My love
Our love
My love
Our love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh how happy
You have made me
Oh how happy
You have made me

Oh how happy
(Oh how happy)
Oh how happy
(Oh how happy)
Oh how happy, ooh you
You have made me
(You have made me)
You have made me
(You have made me)
You have made me
(Yeah you have made me happy)
You have made me
(Oh how happy)
You have made me
(Yeah you have made me happy)
