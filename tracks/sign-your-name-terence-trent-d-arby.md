Fortunately you have got
Someone who relies on you
We started out as friends
But the thought of you just caves me in

The symptoms are so deep
It is so much too late
To turn away
We started out as friends

Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my lady

Time, I'm sure will bring
Disappointments in so many things
It seems to be the way
When your gambling cards on love you play

I'd rather be in hell
With you baby
Than in cool Heaven
It seems to be the way

Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my lady

Birds never look into the sun
Before the day is gone
But oh the light shines brighter
On a peaceful day

Stranger blue, leave us alone
We don't want to deal with you
We'll shed our stains showering
In the room that makes the rain

All alone with you
Makes the butterflies in me arise
Slowly we make love and the Earth rotates
To our dictates, slowly we make love

Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my lady

Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my lady

Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my lady

Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
