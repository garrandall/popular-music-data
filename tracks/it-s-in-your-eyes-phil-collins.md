It's in your eyes
The love you hide away
You can't disguise
The things you feel, the thing you say


If you just call my name
Any time at all, I'll be there


I don't know why
The way you're falling away from me
I can't describe
It's how it feels, it's what I see




I look around, all I see is you
But you gotta tell me that you want me too
Look at me, you're all that I need, it's true






I can't disguise
The love I wait for you to share
I can't deny
If you reach out and touch my hand it's there
