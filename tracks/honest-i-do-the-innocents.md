Heavy is the silence
That hangs upon my soul
The velvet glove of the honest truth
As unmistakable as you
Here we are all bound together
No matter win or lose

Angels and promises
Prisoners and silences
(Say a prayer)

The factory of the innocents
The souls that you canât see
Your fatherâs hands werenât the only fists
That took the best of me
Here we are in the same ship sailing
Across an unknown sea

Angels and promises
Prisoners and silences

Cardinals, sinners and saints
In this world, weâre all the same

Iâm walking on a mountain without a summit
Swimming in a sea without a shore

Say a prayer
Say a prayer

Angels and promises
Prisoners and silences

Say a prayer
Say a prayer
Say a

Oh Lord
Where did the feeling go?
Oh Lord
I never felt so low

Oh-oh
Angels and promises
Oh-oh...
