My man's gone now
Ain't no use a listenin'
For his tired footsteps
Climbin' up the stairs
Old man sorrow's
Come to keep me company
Whisperin' beside me
When I say my prayers
When I say my prayers
He come around
He come up, he come around
Ain't that I mind workin'
Workin' means travelers
Journeyin' together
To the promised land
But old man sorrow
Mountin' all the way with me
Tell' me that I'm old now
Since I lose my man
Since I lose my man
Since I lose my man
