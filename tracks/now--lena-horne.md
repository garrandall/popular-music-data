You pulled the trigger and the night froze
All the people stopped to see
Then my heart fell into pieces
And the skies crashed down on me

You pulled the trigger and the night froze
All the people stopped to see
Then my heart fell into pieces
And the skies crashed down on me

It was the shot heard around the world
It was the shot heard around the world


When I saw ya, it was love at first sight... 
You knew what you were doing, didn't care at what price
Cause I would hold you down... but I won't hold you down
I thought I was the player girl... but you can play around
Your on another level, you dirty, you know it
Playing like you're innocent, not trying to show it
Doesn't even matter cause to you I never mattered
You cut my heart out from my chest and served it on a platter

You said forever, I should've known
You're here one minute, but now you're gone
You keep on talking, but I don't hear none
Cause the damage is done

You pulled the trigger and the night froze
All the people stopped to see
Then my heart fell into pieces
And the skies crashed down on me

It was the shot heard around the world
It was the shot heard around the world


My love for you has gone away
I won't waste another day
If you wanna leave, it's not to my dismay.
You can keep it low... yeah, you can keep it low
Acting like a beginner but you're really a pro
Never woulda guessed you were like the rest
Thought you were the best, but you were something less
My love was on the line, you had my heart and mind
To turn your back on someone who loves you should be a crime

You said forever, I should've known
You're here one minute, but now you're gone
You keep on talking, but I don't hear none
Cause the damage is done

You pulled the trigger and the night froze
All the people stopped to see
Then my heart fell into pieces
And the skies crashed down on me

It was the shot heard around the world
It was the shot heard around the world

Put my guard down, that's what I get
Caught your bullet right in my chest
Put my guard down, that's what I get
Caught your bullet right in my chest

You pulled the trigger and the night froze
All the people stopped to see
Then my heart fell into pieces
And the skies crashed down on me

It was the shot heard around the world
It was the shot heard around the world
