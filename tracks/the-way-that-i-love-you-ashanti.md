After all of the times that we tried
I found out we were living a lie
And after all of this love that we made
I know now you don't love me the same
The way that I love (The way that I love)
The way that I love (The way that I love)
The way that I love (The way that I love you)


I woke up kind of early today and something told me from that moment it wouldn't be the same
Felt like you were hiding something, but I didn't push it
I didn't complain or say nothing
I tried to act like I didn't see it
'Cause deep down, I knew I didn't wanna believe it
There it was, it was you and her, you left your sidekick on the nightstand
And I read


Everything you did and everything you said
Now I'm standing here looking like damn
I thought it was you and I
Now all I got to say is why


After all of the times that we tried
I found out we were living a lie
And after all of this love that we made
I know now you don't love me the same
The way that I love (The way that I love)
The way that I love (The way that I love)
The way that I love (The way that I love you)
Ohh, oh, oh


I notice now that when I'm around you be tryna lock the doors, whispering on the phone
Now wait a minute, since we been in this house, you ain't never did this before
Tell me what's this about, I tried to sit and say to myself
This here is too good, he don't want nothing else
But there it was, it was you and her
You left the credit card receipt inside the beamer with


Everything you bought
Everything you spent, now I'm standing here once again
I thought it was you and I, now all I've got to say is
Why


After all of the times that we tried
I found out we were living a lie
And after all of this love that we made
I know now you don't love me the same
The way that I love (The way that I love)
The way that I love (The way that I love)
The way that I love (The way that I love you)


Ohh, oh, oh
You lied, you lied, oh why, oh why?
Can't, why'd you have to lie to me?
Why'd you have to lie to me?
Why'd you have to lie to me?
Why?


After all of the times that we tried
I found out we were living a lie
And after all of this love that we made
I know now you don't love me the same
The way that I love (The way that I loved you)
The way that I love (The way that I loved you)
The way that I love (The way that I loved you)


Ohh, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh
