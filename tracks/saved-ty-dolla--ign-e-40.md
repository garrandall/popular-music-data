Errytime they see me ballin'
All my old bitches callin'
Pull up in exotic, I see a little bitch jockin'

Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her
Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her
Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her
Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her
Yeah!

No I won't save her
Dolla $ign a fuckboi he won't date her
About my paper, real big shit man everything Taylor
Vans on like a skater
We eatin' over here, man, everything catered
She know I'm a player
She wanna fuck now but I wanna fuck later
She been lookin' for a baller (baller, baller, baller, baller)
Somebody that'll keep her in designer
She ain't thinkin' 'bout love (Ooh)
She got her mind on my money
Can't get a damn thing from me

Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her
Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her
Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her
Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her
Yeah!


Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
What's that nigga name? Captain-Save-A-Ho man
He ain't me and I ain't him
He a bozo, I'm a real one
She take after her auntie, got her mind on my money
Tattoo on her tummy, booty hella chunky
Every time I see her, she look nicer and nicer
Haters throw shade like a sun visor
I told her that I'm broke, can't throw her half of my guap
Bitch I ain't Rescue Ronnie, I ain't captain save a thot
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Make me rich, follow my commands and I'll grant you a wish
I'm just a real one from the gravel, from the soil, the mud
And some of my thugs ain't never been to a club
She ain't looking for love, she just wanna take a ride with the plug cause she...

Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her
Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her
Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her
Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her
Yeah!

Errytime they see me ballin'
All my old bitches callin'
Pull up in exotic, I see a little bitch jockin'

Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her
Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her
Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her
Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her
Yeah!
