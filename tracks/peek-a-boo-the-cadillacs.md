When you come home from the dance
Stand in the halls and make a romance
When ya do the thing you shouldn't do
(Peek-a-boo, a-watchin' you)

When you ought to be in school
Learning about the golden rule
When ya tell a tale that isn't true
(Peek-a-boo, a-watchin' you)

Look in the dark
You see my face
(Ah!)
Don't try to hide
I'm e'rry place
Very cool, hot and sweet
I'm gonna give you, *hot feet

Hope you heard the things I said
Let it sink in your big hard head
When you dance
The soles right off your shoes
(Peek-a-boo, I'm watchin' you)

(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)

Look in the dark
You see my face
(Ow!)
Don't try to hide
I'm er'ry place
Very cool, kind-a sweet
I'm gonna give you, hot feet

Hope you heard the things I said
Let it sink in your big hard head
When you dance
The soles right off the shoes
(Peek-a-boo, I'm watchin' you)

Doin' the things you shouldn't do
(Peek-a-boo, I'm watchin' you)

Doin' the things you shouldn't do
(Peek-a-boo, I'm watchin' you)

Doin' the things you shouldn't do
(Peek-a-boo, I'm watchin' you)

Doin' the things you shouldn't do
(Peek-a-boo, I'm watchin' you).
