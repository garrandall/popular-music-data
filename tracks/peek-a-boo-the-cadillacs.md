When you come home from the dance
Stand in the halls and make a romance
When ya do the thing you shouldn't do
(Peek-a-boo, a-watchin' you)

When you ought to be in school
Learning about the golden rule
When ya tell a tale that isn't true
(Peek-a-boo, a-watchin' you)

Look in the dark
You see my face
(Ah!)
Don't try to hide
I'm e'rry place
Very cool, hot and sweet
I'm gonna give you, *hot feet

Hope you heard the things I said
Let it sink in your big hard head
When you dance
The soles right off your shoes
(Peek-a-boo, I'm watchin' you)

(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)

(Guitar & instrumental)

Look in the dark
You see my face
(Oooow!)
Don't try to hide
I'm er'ry place
Very cool, kind-a sweet
I'm gonna give you, hot feet

Hope you heard the things I said
Let it sink in your big hard head
When you dance
The soles right off the shoes
(Peek-a-boo, I'm watchin' you)

Doin' the things you shouldn't do
(Peek-a-boo, I'm watchin' you)

Doin' the things you shouldn't do
(Peek-a-boo, I'm watchin' you)

FADES-

Doin' the things you shouldn't do
(Peek-a-boo, I'm watchin' you)

Doin' the things you shouldn't do
(Peek-a-boo, I'm watchin' you).

* 'hot feet' refers to a Southern hoodoo
Foot track magic powder (in a can) used to
Send the unwanted person away. Sprinkled
On footprints or socks or shoes. Some of the
Scents are hot, sweet and/or spicey.
