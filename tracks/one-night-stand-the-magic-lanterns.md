Listen to the rumors fly
If is true what I hear
Gossip sure can hurt a guy
Can't you see all our tears

You've been such a silly child
Breaking all of the rules
Playing games and running wild
Someone else's fool

He's a regular guy
With a regular ride
For a one night stand
And he gets what he can
When he can. When he can
He's a one night man

Did I force you to break this spell
And fall into his hand
And he knew very well
You'd be easy as hell
For a one night stand

Don't come running back to me
Are you out of your mind
One thing I will never be
Is the second in line

I know you went out last night
Bet you had some fun
You thought you were treated right
By the 

He's a regular guy
With a regular ride
For a one night stand
And he gets what he can
When he can. where he can
He's a one night man

Did I force you to break this spell
And fall into his hand
And he knew very well
You'd be easy as hell
For a one night stand

He's a regular guy
With a regular ride
For a one night stand
And he gets what he can
When he can. where he can
He's a one night man

Did I force you to break this spell
And fall into his hand
And he knew very well
You'd be easy as hell
For a one night stand

He's a regular guy
With a regular ride
For a one night stand
