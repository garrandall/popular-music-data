When I open this door it feels like a time machine
Where my dreams come and take me back to that discotheque
In this spell binding party, I'm searching for where you will be
All these monsters in love, they keep dancing till morning comes
Mirror ball keeps spinning over the dance floor
And this parade of costumes is ready to Trick or Treat
But I'm right here on my own, I am lost in my confusion
Listen to the rhythm, let it tell me how I should move

Halloween Night! Midnight Boogie Night!
See that Jack O'Lantern smile at you
Come on down and clap your hands! And go shake your hips!
You don't need to think too much on a night like this!
Halloween Night! Now it's time to dance
You don't need to say another word!
Let it go and lose control! Just forget the world!
Once a year we'll have some fun in this carnival
On this day the ghosts are free like animals on
Halloween Night!

Now this is the right time to make my own fantasy world!
I'll fulfill all of my wildest dreams in one night of magic
Don't you ever lose sight of who you were when you were just a child
Now you're reborn once more, free your instincts and let it go!

Halloween Night! Cheek time fall in love!
Before they put on another song
Why don't we go down and dance! Once more on the floor!
If you want to meet someone you have to stand out!
Halloween Night! Come on down and dance!
Let's go surfing in this dancing crowd
There's not much for you to know, just go with the flow
We've got our own corner in this gigantic world!
Where costumes and make up end up falling in love
Special Night!

Are you ready? (Halloween Night!)
Ready? (Halloween Night!)
Ready? (Halloween Night!)
Happy! Happy! Halloween Night!
When the dawn is breaking the only ones left kissing
Well that will be just the two of us
Love is taking over and pulling like gravity
H-A-L-L-O-W-E-E-N
H-A-L-L-O-W-E-E-N
H-A-L-L-O-W-E-E-N
Trick or Treat!!!

Halloween Night! Midnight Boogie Night!
See that Jack O'Lantern smile at you
Come on down and clap your hands! And go shake your hips!
You don't need to think too much on a night like this!
Halloween Night! Now it's time to dance
You don't need to say another word!
Let it go and lose control! Just forget the world!
Once a year we'll have some fun in this carnival
On this day the ghosts are free like animals on
Halloween Night!
Trick or Treat!
