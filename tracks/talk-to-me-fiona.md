Heard about the
Tires on his brand new car
I knew that he'd drive
You crazy
Guess the only option
To fall when you get
Pushed too far
You'll think about that
Next time 
Maybe
Oh, when he's calling
Your name out
When he needs you back
In his life
Cause he's got some secrets 
And all of them came out
When it's all in your name
But you can't make the payment
He needs you to stay
But you wanna go
I know


I know cause
I've been that girl
I've been that 
I've been that 
I've been that girl
I've been that
I've been that
I've been that girl
I've been that
I've been that
I've been that girl
Whoa hoo oh 


But never again
Never again
Never again
Never again
Never again
Never again
No, never again

Heard you got into it
With his ex Sunday night
Who really fights on a Sunday?
Must be sick 
Of tellin' your friends
That life's alright
You'll wanna change 
That shit one day
Oh
When you been in the kitchen
And you fix him a dinner
You wanna go talk to him
But he doesn't listen
When he's played
Enough games
And you played your position
He'll tell you to stay
But you'll wanna go
I know
