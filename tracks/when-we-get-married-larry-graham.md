Darling, oh...

When we get married
We'll have a big celebration
And send invitations
To all our friends and relations

And we'll have a ball
Dancin' and all
When we get married

When the bells ring
To tell the world I'm taking your hand
Folks from all over
Will come to see the wedding we planned

We'll have a ball
Dancin' and all
When we get married

And whoa
(We'll have a ball)
We'll have a ball
(Dancing and all)

And darling, it will be so woo-wee
So grand
(We'll have a ball)
We'll have a ball
(Dancing and all)
And sweetheart, we'll be as one
(When we get married)

Let's wait and see
Our wedding day is not very far
And oh, folks will whisper
And they'll say how lovely we both are

And we'll have a ball
Dancin' and all
When we get married

You and me
When we get married
Me and you, you and me
We'll be married

Whoa... oh... oh...
When we get married
And oh...
We'll be married
You and me, me and you
