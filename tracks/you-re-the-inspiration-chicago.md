You know our love was meant to be
The kind of love that lasts forever
And I want you here with me
From tonight until the end of time
You should know, everywhere I go
Always on my mind, in my heart
In my soul, Baby


You're the meaning in my life
You're the inspiration
You bring feeling to my life
You're the inspiration
Wanna have you near me
I wanna have you hear me sayin'
No one needs you more than I need you


And I know, yes I know that it's plain to see
So in love when we're together
Now I know that I need you here with me
From tonight until the end of time
You should know, everywhere I go
Always on my mind, in my heart
In my soul


You're the meaning in my life
You're the inspiration
You bring feeling to my life
You're the inspiration
Wanna have you near me
I wanna have you hear me sayin'
No one needs you more than I need you



Wanna have you near me
I wanna have you hear me sayin'
No one needs you more than I need you


You're the meaning in my life
You're the inspiration
You bring feeling to my life
You're the inspiration
When you love somebody 'til the end of time
When you love somebody
Always on my mind
No one needs you more than I
When you love somebody 'til the end of time
When you love somebody
Always on my mind
I need you
