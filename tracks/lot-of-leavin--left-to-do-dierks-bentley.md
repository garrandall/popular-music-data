These old boots still got a lot of ground
They ain't covered yet
There's at least another million miles
Under these old bus treads
So if you think I'm gonnna settle down
I've got news for you
I still got a lot of leavin' left to do

And as long as there's a song
Left in this old guitar
This life I'm bound to lead
Ain't for the faint of heart
So you won't fall for me
If you know what's good for you
'Cause I still got a lot of leavin' left to do

I guess the Lord made me hard to handle
So lovin' me might be a long shot gamble
So before you go and turn me on
Be sure that you can turn me loose
'Cause I still got a lot of leavin' left to do

Girl, you look like you might be an angel
So I won't lie
I could love you like the devil
If you wanted me to tonight
And we could talk about forever for a day or two
But I still got a lot of leavin' left to do

I guess the Lord made me hard to handle
So lovin' me might be a long shot gamble
So before you go and turn me on
Be sure that you can turn me loose
'Cause I still got a lot of leavin' left to do

Yeah, I still got a leavin' left to do
