Oh western union man
Send a telegram to my baby
Send a telegram, send a telegram
Who, send a telegram to my baby
This is what I want you to do
I want you to tell her that I'm all alone
I tried to call her on the phone
Tell her I'm in misery
And think she's avoiding me
And if the telegram don't do
Send a box of candy too
And maybe some flowers
Tell her that I missed her for hours and hours
Send a telegram, send a telegram
Send a telegram man
To my baby you hear what I say
Oh western union man send a telegram
Send a telegram to my baby
Oh western union man
Hey send a telegram
Send a telegram, send a telegram
Oh send a telegram to my baby
This is what I want you to do
Listen, tell me have you got a boy you can send
This is what I want him to do
Put him on his bike right away
See if he can get my message through
Maybe tomorrow
But mail it right away
I want the girl to know that I miss her
Something like yesterday
Send a telegram, send a telegram man
To my baby
Do you hear what I say
Oh western union man why don't you send a telegram
Oh send a telegram to my baby
Western union man send a telegram
Oh send it right on to my baby
Hey western union man
Send a telegram, send a telegram
