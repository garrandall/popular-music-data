I got my first real six-string
Bought it at the five-and-dime
Played it till my fingers bled
It was summer of '69
Me and some guys from school
We had a band and we tried real hard
But Jimmy quit and Joey got married
I should've known we'd never get far

Oh, when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenings at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, yeah
Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

Oh yeah
Back in summer of '69

Man, we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever
Forever, yeah

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that it'd last forever
Oh, the way you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Back in the summer of '69
'69
(Back in the summer of '69)
('69)
It was the summer of '69
