Choo choo moma, won't you ride the train?
My life without you is just misery and pain, come back to me
I'll treat you best I can
Choo choo moma, you should have a choo choo man

Choo choo moma, won't you ride a rail?
I need your loving, can't you hear me wail, come back to me
You know I love you so
Choo choo moma, won't you get a choo choo home?

Choo choo moma, won't you ride the track?
I need your loving, won't you bring some back on home to me
I need your loving, babe
Choo choo moma, don't you know you drive me mad?

Choo choo moma, you're a cheery thing
I love you, baby, can't you help me sing, come back to me
I want you back again
Choo choo moma, won't you get a choo choo train?
