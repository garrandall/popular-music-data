Kells!!! Cam'Ron (Killa!!!)
We on camels, in our throwbacks (Yeah!) Remix desert hot
(1964 throwback, uh huh) Big Tigg!!!
(I'm here with you straight from Harlem)
To a special lady all around the world
(Who we lookin for Killa? come on, let's do it)


Come on and move your body like a snake ma, shake until it wanna break ma
Don't hold back let it go ma, let your money maker jump ma
Come on and, let me see you go low ma, bring it up and let it go ma
I, love the way you work your chocha, makes me wanna get to know ya
We gonna pop open a bottle of the Hypnotic no more time waste let's get this party started
Track so strong it's like it's bionic so funky it's like somebody farted
Poppin it like a string on a guitar, superstar you know who you are
Body smokin like a cuban cigar, your the mama and i'm the dada
These honeys in America, shake ass like their from Africa
That;s why i'm always up up in the club, V.I.P. with thugs and liquor


I travel far and wide lookin for the girl
Who can snake can snake can snake can snake can snake
Goin club to club lookin for the girl
Who can snake can snake can snake can snake can snake
Ten thousand g's for the girl
Who knows she can snake can snake can snake can snake can snake
Been around the world lookin for the girl
Who can snake can snake can snake can snake can snake
(Could it be you now, could it be you ma,
could it be you now, could it be you ma)


Come on and move your body like a snake ma, shake until it wanna break ma
Don't hold back let it go ma, let your money maker jump ma
Come on and, let me see you go low ma, bring it up and let it go ma
I, love the way you work your chocha, makes me wanna get to know ya
Like two gorillas in the jungle makin love!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Come on and put your mother, hands in the air now
Represent your block like you don't care now
Ladies relax and let your hair down
All my thugs throw it up and just wyle out


Beep beep that's the jeep
Toot toot that's the couep three jeeps (Uh huh)
Two coupes (Whoa!)
Capri jeans (Whoa!) blue boots
(Whoa!) She mean and plus she too cute
Hey ma, look girl don't become a statistic
They losin we winnin it's um terrific
Come vi-visit (Visit)
I'm Mike, I wasn't for the Bull (Bull)
I'm one of them Wizards
And I be downtown Radisson northside Addison
Westside Madison southside we back again
(The hundreds) Not to G you
(Not at all) I'm a G boo (That's true)
R.I.P. to lives lost and E too
Meet you in heaven, that's the sequel
All y'all my people dug from the cathedral
Right now I got candles and cake
No scandals, ma'am no handle the snake, Killa!!!!




Move your body like a snake ma wait ma
The Hypnotic bringin out your exotic nature
Twenty five out of a dime is what I rate ya
Never mind the other girls (You know they gonna hate ya)
So squeeze me like a python white thong
Bumpin and grindin up in the corner (All night long)
At least until they cut the lights on
Turnin you on by nibblin on your ear like Ty-son
(R. Kelly: Shake that thing!)
Big Tigg' want you ta (Shake that thing!)
R. Kells want you ta, move them hips like a whirlwind
Private pool party after this for me and you and your girlfriend


Bring me along, to your afterparty, whoa oh oh!!!!
Smokin on, drinkin juice and Bacardi, whoa oh oh!!!




Come on and move your body like a snake ma, shake until it wanna break ma
Don't hold back let it go ma, let your money maker jump ma
Come on and, let me see you go low ma...
