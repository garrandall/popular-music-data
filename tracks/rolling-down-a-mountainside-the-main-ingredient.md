Losers and winners
Everyone must play fair
All you beginners know
That you've got to start somewhere

(So) Whether you're saints or sinners
(Smile) Smile and share
(Sun) Sunlight as well as shadows
While you learn that everyone cares (Everyone cares)
Everyone out there (Everyone out there)
Has a cross to bear (Has a cross to bear)
And we'll never dare to live alone

'Cause we're not stones rolling down a mountainside
We all count and we've got strength and we got pride
'Cause God is on our side (God is on our side, God is on our side)
Mmm, hm, God is on our side, hm, hm

Winners and losers
Fight when you know you're right
You'll get some bruises but
Some fool see the light

(So) So when you talk confused, yeah
(Keep) Keep your pride
(Smile) Smile and you'll make them listen
While you teach, then we'll be alright (We'll be alright)

Birds will stay in flight (Birds will stay in flight)
Day will follow night (Day will follow night)
So keep the truth in sight
But no, no, no

'Cause we're not stones rolling down a mountainside
We all count and we've got strength and we got pride
'Cause God is on our side (God is on our side, God is on our side), baby, girl
God is on our side (Oh, oh ooh
I said (God is on our side, God is on our side) we're not stones, no, no
(Oh, oh ooh
Hey, baby, hey (God is on our side, God is on our side)
Mmm, hm, mmm, hm (Oh, oh ooh
God is on our side (God is on our side, God is on our side)
Hey, we ain't stones, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no (Oh, oh ooh

Givers and takers (God is on our side), whoa, you heart breakers (God is on our side)
We could break or make up, God is on our side, yeah
Come on, mmm... hm... hm...
Come on, yeah, yeah

Rolling down a mountainside
Rolling down a mountainside
Rolling down a mountainside
Rolling down a mountainside
Rolling down a mountainside
Rolling down a mountainside
