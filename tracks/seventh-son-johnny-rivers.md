Everybody talkin' 'bout the seventh son
In the whole wide world there is only one

And I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one
The one they call the seventh son

I can tell your future, it will come to pass
I can do things to you make your heart feel glad
Look in the sky, predict the rain
Tell when a woman's got another man

I'm the one, oh, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one
The one they call the seventh son

I can talk these words that will sound so sweet
They will even make your little heart skip a beat
Heal the sick, raise the dead
Make the little girls talk outta their heads

I'm the one, oh, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one
The one they call the seventh son

I can talk these words that will sound so sweet
They will even make your little heart skip a beat
Heal the sick, raise the dead
And make the little girls talk outta their heads

I'm the one, oh, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one
The one they call the seventh son

I'm the one, hey, hey
I'm the one
Oh, I'm the one, babe
Ooh, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one
The one they call the seventh son
I'm the one, I'm the one
The one they call the seventh son
