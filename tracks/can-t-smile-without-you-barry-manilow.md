You know I can't smile without you
I can't smile without you
I can't laugh and I can't sing
I'm finding it hard to do anything
You see, I feel sad when you're sad
I feel glad when you're glad
If you only knew what I'm going through
I just can't smile without you


You came along just like a song
And brightened my day
Who'd have believed that you were part of a dream?
Now it all seems light-years away


And now you know I can't smile without you (No I can't smile without you)
I can't smile without you
I can't laugh and I can't sing
I'm finding it hard to do anything
You see, I feel sad when you're sad
I feel glad when you're glad
If you only knew what I'm going through
I just can't smile


Now some people say happiness takes so very long to find
Well, I'm finding it hard leaving your love behind me


And you see I can't smile without you
I can't smile without you
I can't laugh and I can't sing
I'm finding it hard to do anything
You see I feel glad when you're glad
(I feel sad) I feel sad when you're sad
If you only knew what I'm going through
I just can't smile without you


(Can't smile without you
Can't smile without you
Can't laugh and I can't sing
I'm finding it hard to do anything)
