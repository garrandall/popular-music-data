New York City ("Hunger for More!")
You are now rocking with the best
Lloyd Banks
G-Unit!


We on fire
Up in here, it's burning hot
We on fire!
Shorty take it off if it get too hot, up in this spot
We on fire!
Tear the roof off this motherfucker, light the roof on fire
Uh, nigga what you say
We getting loose in this motherfucker, light the roof on fire, fire, firethis


(Right?)
Nah, I ain't putting nothing out, I smoke when I wanna
26-inch chrome spokes on the Hummer
This heat gon last for the whole summer
Running your bitch faster than the Road Runner
Rocks on my wrist, rolls gold under
Glocks on my hip, those throw thunder
I'm buying diamond by the pier
But when you stop, the only thing still spinning is your hair
Yeah, I'm riding with that all black snub
Raiders cap back, all black gloves
I'm 80's man, but the boy smack thugs
These record sales equal more back rubs
Not to mention I bought a pack of clubs
His impacts about as raw as crack was
Now all these new artists getting wrong deals
I'm only 21, sitting on mills


We on fire
Up in here, it's burning hot
We on fire!
Shorty take it off if it get too hot, up in this spot
We on fire!
Tear the roof off this motherfucker, light the roof on fire
Uh, nigga what you say
We getting loose in this motherfucker, light the roof on fire, fire, fire


(Ugh)
If you know anything about me, then you know I'm a baller
If I don't hit the first night, I ain't gon' call her
I'm trying to play, you trying to have my daughter
But I can't blame her for what her momma taught her
And I don't care bout what the next nigga bought her
Cause I ain't putting no baguettes in her butter
I got a diamond about as clear as water
And I got bread, but I ain't sparing a quarter
So cut the games ma, let's go in the back
Matter fact, turn your ass 'round, back a nigga down
And I ain't bias when I'm riding through the town
Like 'em small, like 'em tall, like 'em black, like 'em brown
She gotta be able to come when I need her
Tight ass pants, little wife beater
Regular chick or R&B diva
Bitch say something, I ain't a mind reader


We on fire
Up in here, it's burning hot
We on fire!
Shorty take it off if it get too hot, up in this spot
We on fire!
Tear the roof off this motherfucker, light the roof on fire
Uh, nigga what you say?
We getting loose in this motherfucker, light the roof on fire, fire, fire
