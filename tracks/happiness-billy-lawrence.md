Oh
Happiness


Oh, happiness is what I feel
When you're around me
And, baby, don't you know
That's all I feel

Hey, loving you is something
So easy to do
You are a part of me
Baby, that's all I need


You came into my life
When my world seemed so unright
You walked inside my dreams
Dreaming to me
Is now reality

You are my precious one
You're my sunshine
When it's raining

Now that you know all these things
I wanna welcome you
In my arms of happiness


Oh, happiness
(Oh, happiness)
Feels so good to be alive

Oh, happiness
(Oh, happiness)
Now that I know
I have you by my side


Oh, happiness is all I feel
When you're around me
Whenever I'm feeling down
I just make sure you're around

And I wish I could give you
What you've given to me
Just to know
How I feel
Baby, I know it's for real
