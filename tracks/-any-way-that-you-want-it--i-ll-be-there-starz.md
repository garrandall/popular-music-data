Any way that you want it
Any way that you care
Any way that you need me
I'll be there

Any way that you want it
Any way that you care
Any way that you need me
I'll be there
I'll be there

When he runs away
With your heart
When your world
Comes apart
I got love
That's a start
And I'll be back
I'll be back
I'll be back
For more

Any way that you want it
Any way that you care
Any way that you need me
I'll be there
I'll be there

And when he's got your head
In a whirl
I'll be there
With you girl
Anywhere in the world
You know I'll be back
I'll be back
I'll be back for more

Any way that you want it

Time and tears
Have closed the door
But I'll be back
I'll be back
I'll be back for more

Any way that you want it
Any way that you care
Any way that you need me
I'll be there

If you ever should want it
If you ever should care
If you ever should need me
I'll be there

I'll be there
I'll be there
I'll be there
I'll be there
