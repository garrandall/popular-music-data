Where is heaven? (In your heart)
Outside, outside, outside, outside

When the angels looked down, they saw you walk away
They knew you hurt me more and more each day

So don't leave me, leave me, leave me all alone
Leave me, leave me, leave me all alone
Outsi yi yi yi yi yi yide, outside the gates of heaven
Outsi yi yi yi yi yi yide, outside the gates of heaven

When the angels looked down, they knew my fate
They cried and cried and cried when you closed the gate

If you'd only say "Be my, be my baby"
I'd be right there by your side (inside, inside, inside)
Running home (running) to catch you
The gates will open up wide

Outsi yi yi yi yi yi yide, outside the gates of heaven
Outsi yi yi yi yi yi yide, outside the gates of heaven

Outside, yes I'm outside, oh and all alone (heaven)
