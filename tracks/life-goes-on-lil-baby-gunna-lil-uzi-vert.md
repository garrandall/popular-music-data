Spider (Hey)
Hey (SEX, Spider, SEX)

Yeah, I'm on that drank, I'm 'bout to kill (Woah)
I got the drop, I got the kill (Woah)
Takin' a bitch, I got the seal (Yeah)
I got this peppermint patty, it's teal
She off the boat and she came from Israel
Fuck from the back until I'm smacked
Smoke on that thrax, I'm on strawberry peels
Strawberry peels, strawberry peels
Strawberry peels, strawberry peels (Yeah)
Strawberry peels
Cop what I want and my wrist and my style is on crunk and it's real
Half of my niggas get high off a seal
Brand new pints and they all teal
I put my dick in her bladder, yeah, yeah
And I'm fuckin' her friends and they all here

Strawberry peels, strawberry peels
Strawberry peels, strawberry peels
Strawberry peels, strawberry peels
Strawberry peels, strawberry peels
Strawberry peels, strawberry peels
Strawberry peels, strawberry peels


Flooded the wrist
Let my bro hit her, I'm good with assist (Good)
Know it's expensive, can tell by the stitch (Why?)
Crept in the club with thirty in the stick (Thirty)
VLONE, Chrome Heart, it's still stuck on the rich
She can't talk right now 'cause she suckin' this dick
YSL slatt life, we slimy and slick (Slatt)
Got a young bull that pull up, let it spit (Bull)
He hit and don't miss
Hop out a jet, hop in a Rolls
Icy Patek straight off of shows (Straight off of shows)
I want the platinum, I'm cool on the gold
She suckin' it 'til the snot come out her nose (Wow)
I bought an old Cutlass, I set it on fours (Set it on fours)
I pop me a pill, I feel geeked up for sure
You front me a pack, I'ma go get it sold
Young Wunna, young Wunna, I can't break the code (Young Wunna)


I bend her over, I make her kneel
Stand on my money like my name Shaquille
Construction man, runnin' right through these drills
I cannot breathe 'cause there's ice on my gills
She give me brain, that's that Urkel and chill
She mixed with white, told her my name Jaleel
Uzi too rich, man, how does it feel?
Tryna be humble, man, I ain't tryna kill
They walk on my heels, my heels made of steel
That's no oil my spill, I burnt off the wheel
She ate up the deal
My baby so spoiled just like some old milk
The paint on my whip, it's already peeled
Put my dick in her gut, it's just for the guilt
Fuckin' this bitch, did that right on film
I need the beat, that's just for the stems (Yeah)


Strawberry peels, strawberry peels (Yeah)
Strawberry peels, strawberry peels (Yeah)
Strawberry peels, strawberry peels (Yeah)
Strawberry peels, strawberry peels (Yeah)
Strawberry peels, strawberry peels (Yeah)
Strawberry peels, strawberry peels (Yeah)
