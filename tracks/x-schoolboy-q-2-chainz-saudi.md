Somebody pop all day (hol' up)
Somebody on they way (hol' up)(black panther)

Somebody can't relate (hol' up)

Are you on ten yet?
Are you on ten yet? I live on ten (wait)
But are you on ten yet?
Are you on ten yet? (hol' up)
Fuck the place up, fuck the place up
Fuck the place up, fuck the place up

Ngiphethe ucherry we ngamla, black card on her
Money longer than hair on her
In her mouth like cavity
And I’m higher than her dads salary

Somebody's daughter finna swallow all these children
Imali is my Achilles' heel, yeah
I race you to a hundred million


Somebody pop all day (hol' up)
Somebody on they way (hol' up)
I wore the crown all day (hol' up)
Somebody can't relate (hol' up)

Black on black again, I might gold the trim
I been built to win, I don't exit here
Too much flexin' here, Go-Go Gadget this
Too much bread to get, I've been stretchin' up
Ain't no catchin' up, I don't rest enough, ugh

Fucked up someone's stage again
From strip clubs to stadiums

I wore the crown all day (hol' up)
Somebody can't relate (hol' up)
