Hey fellas
I'm talking to you you and you too
Do you guys know who I'm talking to?
Those of you who go out and stay
Out all night and half the next day
And expect us to be home
When you get there

But let me tell you something
The sisters are not going for that no more
Cause we realize two things;
That you aren't doing anything for us
We can do better by ourselves
So from now on we gonna use
What we got to get what we want
So you'd better think, think

It was the time when we haven't met?
That's the thing I never will forget
Now baby I got a life to live
And a whole lotta loving
That a woman could give yeah

But before I give it up I gotta think think
Think what the future holds for me
Just go ahead and see
I don't need no heartache
I can't stand no misery
Let me think think

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
All right yeah

Don't say it's easy
Just plain living
Sometimes it's kinda tough

If it's not in your vision
Don't make no decision
Hey yeah all right

So I'm laying the cards on the table
When it comes to taking care of me
I know I'm able
You may not call it true
But I won't do nothing that you won't do
Said I won't do nothing that you won't do

So think about the good things
Come on and think about the right things
You got to think about me too

Come on and think think about you
Come on and think about the good things
Come on and think about the right things
Come on and think about me too
