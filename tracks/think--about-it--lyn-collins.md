Sitting here, it's a drag
But you know, I'm gonna sit right here until my man comes home
Because I believe in him, and I believe in what he's trying to do
And I know that sooner or later, he'll come walking in that door
And I'm gonna be right here to greet him
With a cup of coffee, and maybe a sandwich
But I have faith in him
And I know that he's doing what he feels is right
But you know, sometime I ask myself: Is this all in vain?
My friends are walking around, they're talking about me and saying I'm a fool
And I ask myself: How long can I keep it up?

It's been days and nights since you were here to hold me
I even miss the screamin', and all of those bad temper fights
I'm determined to see you, just as soon as I can
And even though you make me wait, you're still my only man

How long can I keep it up?
How long can I keep it up?

I'll always wait for you
It's really not that hard to do
But it's truly a fact, and I can't actually relax
I wake up late at night, so scared I could hardly speak
But I'll always come through
Because I know someday soon, I'll see you

How long can I keep it up?
How long can I keep it up?

I know a man does what he feels is right
And it really means the world to me
Know there's always you
To think about, to care about, and always count on, too
How long can I keep it up?
How long can I keep it up?

You know I'd lie for you, stand up to any test
And if I have to kill, I would
I wouldn't kill you, but for you
And if I have to die, I'll die
As long as I die with you
But I'm Mama Feelgood, and I'm gonna have some fun
Even if it's at the point of a gun

How long can I keep it up?
How long can I keep it up?

It's the end, but I can go happy
Because I, I, I, I have one friend
A friend 'til the end, a friend 'til the end
You're the love friend
How long can I keep it up?
How long can I keep it up?
How long, how long can I keep it up?
Can you tell me, how long can I keep it up?
I know I'll be there as long as you need me
But I wonder how long can it last
Even if it's at the point of a gun
I'm Mama Feelgood, and I'm gonna have some fun
How long can I keep it up?
How long can I keep it up?
