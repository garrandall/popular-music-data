Life lends a crushing blow
And once again a heart is broken
And as history repeats itself
These few words are sadly spoken

I've passed this way before
And I've felt this pain before
A hurt that took so long to end
Has found my poor heart again

As I watch love walking away
It brings back old memories
A familiar pain still feels the same
Once again heartache has found me

A dark cloud covered my heart
Oh, when she told me goodbye
Now there's nothing left but emptiness
And the tears that fill my crying eyes

I've passed this way before
And I've felt this pain before
A hurt that took so long to end
Has found my poor heart again

No matter how strong a man is
Without love he walks in the dark
If love deserts him it will surely hurt him
Cos his weakness is his heart

A lonely journey now stands before me
The endless pain has started
But this time I know the way
Walking alone and broken hearted

It so hard to face reality
Knowing loneliness is my destiny

Because I've passed this way before
And I've felt this pain before
A hurt that took so long to end
Has found my poor heart again
