Well my heart didn't skip a beat 
When I saw you standing there 
Looking like some kind a angel 
Like you were walking on air 
And the earth didn't move 
When you first said my name 
I didn't feel a thing, no not me, 
My heart didn't skip a beat 

This aint no love song 
I just felt getting my guitar on and singing a tune 
Singing about you 
Feeling good and tapping my shoes 
And all this stuff I'm making up well you probably 
Won't be hearing it on the radio but then you never know 

So baby if you want 
You can sing along 
But this ain't no love song 

I couldn't sleep last night but you weren't on my mind 

And I went for a drive last night but if you saw me driving by well I must've took a wrong turn 

I must've been thinking bout something else had a melody in my head yeah maybe that's why 

I couldn't sleep last night 
This ain't no love song 
I just felt like getting my guitar on and singing a tune, 
Singing bout you, feeling good and tapping my shoes 
And all this stuff I'm making up well you probably won't be hearing it on the radio
But then you never know 

So baby if you want you can sing along 
But this ain't no love song, love song, love song singing to you baby singing to you baby 
All night long 

Yeah half this stuff I'm making up well you probably won't be hearing it on the radio 
But then you never know 
So baby if you want you can sing along 
But this ain't no love song, love song, love song 

This ain't no love song
