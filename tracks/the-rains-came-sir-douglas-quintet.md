Rain, rain, rain, rain
My tears keep tumbling down
I haven't seen my baby
Since I left this town

Rain, rain, rain, rain
My pillows soaking wet
You broke my heart
And I ain't over it yet

Rain, rain, rain, rain
Like to see my girl again
Rain, rain, rain, rain
Why'd you cause me so much pain

Rain, rain, rain, rain
My pillows soaking wet
You broke my heart
And caused me so much pain

Rain, rain, rain, rain
Like to see my girl again
Rain, rain, rain, rain
I wanna see you again

Please rain, come on, rain
Why'd you cause me so much pain
You broke my heart
And you caused me so much pain

Rain, rain, rain, rain
Like to see my girl again
Rain, rain, rain, rain
I wanna see you again
