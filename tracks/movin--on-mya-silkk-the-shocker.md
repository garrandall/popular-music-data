Ay Yo Mya
I know you got a man and all
But uhhhh I been watchin y'all
And if he ain't treatin' you right
It's about time you move on
Now I'm not tryna get in between y'all two,
But if you gonna move, move this way


I'm so confused
I don't know what to do
But I gotta be a woman
I gotta get over you
I think I saw your baby's motha
Creeping at yo back door
And ya lying ass been cheatin'
And I can't take it no more oh no
I'm movin on


On (Movin on)
On (movin on-on)
Oh-on
I'll be movin on



Whose drawers are these?
You know I wear a size 4
And if you say that you've been faithful
Who was at your back door?
You ain't got no money
I should've left you long ago
And you stroke ain't strokin' no more
So I've been sleepin all alone
If ya know what I mean
I'm movin on




Well now I'm a No Limit Soldier
Known to keep it rowdy
You know one's that make you say uhh
And Bout It, Bout It
Now one to the two
Two to the three
I aint sayin' leave him
But you should like roll wit me
Cause I can see you ain't happy here
When I look in your eyes
You a bird, spread your wings
Cuz now it's time to fly
You aint never gotta trip
Or remind me
I'm trying to live ghetto fab
Like takin' baths
In bottles of Don P
But I ain't perfect
Just imagine me with no flaws
Like a parking lot, Wit no cars
Cell block, Wit no bars
World wit no wars, L.A. wit no stars
So check this out
I can heal your broken heart
So don't be so fast To react so quick
Or get all mad And try to scratch up my 6
Now you know I get paid
For bustin all kind of tight verses
See I need a girl, That I can see on top
Like Silkk and Mya
Or vice versa
