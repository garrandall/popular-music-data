In my dreams it's still the same
Your love is strong, it still remains
Yeah
Uh huh

Toss and turn all night in the sheets
I can't sleep (I can't sleep)
Night after night don't know what it means
In my dreams (In my dreams)
What can I say or do
You won't come back, were through
I've realized too late
That, baby, your love has turned away
In my dreams it's still the same
Your love is strong, it still remains
In my dreams you're still by me
Just the way it used to be
Hey
Ah
Calling your name, but you're turning away
Please don't leave
Running in circles, waiting to see
You in my dreams (in my dreams)
What can I say or do
(What can I say or do)
You won't come back, we're through
I've realized too late
That, baby, your love has turned away
In my dreams it's still the same
Your love is strong, it still remains
In my dreams you're still by me
Just the way it used to be

In my dreams I'll never be without you
In my dreams there's nothing we can't do
In my dreams I never have to doubt you
In my dreams I'm still in love with you, it's true

In my dreams it's still the same
Your love is strong, it still remains
In my dreams you're still by me
Just the way it used to be
In my dreams it's still the same
Your love is strong, it still remains
In my dreams you're still by me
Just the way it used to be
In my dreams it's still the same
Your love is strong, it still remains
