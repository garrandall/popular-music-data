You're the sunlight that opened my eyes
When the world was tumbling down
You're the river that gave me a drink
When a drop of water couldn't be found

You give me what I want when I want it
And all I'll ever want is you, oh oh

I was born to be loved by somebody
And I know that somebody is you
I'm gonna love you 'til the day that I die
And there ain't nothing that nobody can do

I love the way you
Make love when you make it
And I just wanna make it with you

So I just wanna keep our love alive
(We've got to keep our love alive)
So I can go on living, we've got to keep
(We've got to keep our love alive)
So don't ever stop what you're giving to me

You're like a summer of breeze on my face
When it looks like there'll be nothing but rain
You brought the sunshine and now I can say
There'll never be a cloudy day again

I love the way that you do
When you do it
And I just wanna do it to you

So I just wanna keep our love alive
(We've got to keep our love alive)
So I can go on living, we've got to keep
(We've got to keep our love alive)
So don't ever stop what you're giving to me

Don't let it die
(We've got to keep our love alive)
Don't let it die
(We've got to keep our love alive)

No, don't let it die
(We've got to keep it alive)
We've got to keep (keep)
Our love alive

So I can go on living, we've got to keep
(We've got to keep our love alive)
So I can go on living

We've got to keep
(We've got to keep our love alive)
So don't ever stop what you're giving to me

We've got to keep our love alive
(We've got to keep our love alive)
So I can go on living, we've got to keep
(We've got to keep our love alive)
So don't ever stop what you're giving to me
