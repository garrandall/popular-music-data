Well you're all grown up and lookin' good
Been painting your face like a geisha would
Been practising the art of treachery
Little girls learn this at their mothers' knee

Sugar Daddy gonna me you happy
Sugar Daddy gonna make it nice
Sugar Daddy gonna give you candy
But you gonna pay Sugar Daddy's price

Well I know what you want and you know how to get it
Nothin but money gonna make you feel better
I'll buy you a dress and I'll buy you a car
I might even buy you an electric guitar

Cause I'm your
Sugar Daddy gonna me you happy
Sugar Daddy gonna make it nice
Sugar Daddy gonna give you candy
But you gonna pay Sugar Daddy's price

(Sweet) Oh smile for the camera
(As sugar) Yeah smile for the world
(Sweet) Oh smile....give me your, give me your best smile
(As candy) Like a sweet little girl

So don't bother me with all your personal life
And I will ignore those little white lies
And when the fairy falls from the Christmas tree
Don't ever think that you can run to me

Cause I'm your
Sugar Daddy gonna me you happy
Sugar Daddy gonna make it nice
Sugar Daddy gonna give you candy
But you gonna pay Sugar Daddy's price
Yeah Sugar Daddy gonna make you happy
Sugar Daddy gonna make it right
Sugar Daddy gonna give you candy
But you gonna pay
Yeah, you're gonna pay Sugar Daddy's price
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
But you gonna pay
You're gonna pay Sugar Daddy's price
