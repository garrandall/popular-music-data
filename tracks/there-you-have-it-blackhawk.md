You're the kind of woman, I've been dreaming of.
But I never thought I could ever say it good enough to win your love
You probably think I'm foolish you probably tell me so
I open up my heart then you're probably going to tell me no, but here I go
I want to give you all I've got inside, I want to love you for the rest of my life

There I've done it.
There I've said it.
There you have it.
I don't regret it.
I give you my love, in a minute, if you want it, come and get it.
There I've done it.
There I've said it.
There you have it.

This is confidential, I never told a soul.
Every time I see you, feel my heart begin to lose control.
And all I know; is I'm feeling something I've never felt.
I want to be with you and nobody else.

There I've done it.
There I've said it.
There you have it.
I don't regret it.
I give you my love, in a minute, if you want it, come and get it.
There I've done it.
There I've said it.
There you have it.

There I've done it.
There I've said it.
There you have it.
I don't regret it.
I give you my love, in a minute, if you want it, come and get it.
There I've done it.
There I've said it.
There you have it.
Oh yah yah yah

There I've done it.
There I've said it.
There you have it.
