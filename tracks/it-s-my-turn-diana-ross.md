I can't cover up my feelings
In the name of love
Or play it safe
For a while that was easy

And if living for myself
Is what I'm guilty of
Go on and sentence me
I'll still be free

It's my turn
To see what I can see
I hope you'll understand
This time's just for me

Because it's my turn
With no apologies
I've given up the truth
To those I've tried to please

But now it's my turn
If I don't have all the answers
At least I know
I'll take my share of chances
Ain't no use of holding of
When nothing stays the same

So I'll let it rain
Cause the rain ain't gonna hurt me
And I'll let you go
Though I know it won't be easy

It's my turn
With no more room for lies
For years I'd seen my life
Through someone else's eyes

And now it's my turn
To try and find my way
And if I should get lost
At least I'll own today

It's my turn
Yes, it's my turn
And there ain't no use in holding of
When nothing stays the same

So I'll let it rain
Cause the rain ain't gonna hurt me
And I'll let you go
Though I know it won't be easy

It's my turn
To see what I can see
I hope you'll understand
This time's just for me

Because it's my turn
To turn and say goodbye
I sure would like to know
That you're still on my side

Because it's my turn
It's my turn

It's my turn
To start from number one
Trying to undo
Some damage that's been done

But now it's my turn
To reach and touch the sky
No one's gonna say
At least I didn't try

It's my turn
Yes, it's my turn

It's my turn
It's my turn
It's my turn
