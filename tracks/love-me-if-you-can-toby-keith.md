Sometimes think the war is necessary
Every night I pray for peace on earth
And I hand down my dollars to the homeless
But believe that every able soul should work


My father gave me my shotgun
That I'll hand down to my son
Try to teach him everything it means


I'm a man of my convictions
Call me wrong, call me right
But I bring my better angels to every fight
You may not like where I'm going
But you sure know where I stand
Hate me if you want to
Love me if you can


I stand by my right to speak freely
But I worry 'bout what kids learn from TV
And before all of debatin' turns to angry words and hate
Sometimes we should just agree to disagree


And I believe that Jesus
Looks down here and sees us
And if you ask him, he would say
