Thought I was in love before
And then you moved in next door
Pretty blue eyes, pretty blue eyes

All the guys from the neighborhood
Keep sayin' you sure look good
With your blue eyes, pretty blue eyes

Saw you from my window
My heart skipped a beat
Gonna sit by your doorstep
So that I can meet

Pretty blue eyes, please come out today
So I can tell you what I have to say
That I love you, love you
Pretty blue eyes

Saw you from my window
My heart skipped a beat
Gonna sit by your doorstep
So that I can meet

Pretty blue eyes, please come out today
So I can tell you what I have to say
That I love you, love you
Pretty blue eyes


Pretty blue eyes
