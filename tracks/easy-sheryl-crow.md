We said that summer we'd go down to Cancun
But no money makes that kind of hard to do
Forget the beach – I’d rather be here with you
Playing Croquet okay, maybe, that’s not true


But you make it easy, easy, easy to get away
Sit in the sun and drink beer all day
Because it's easy, easy, easier anyway
Hey, who needs Mexico?
Baby, let's stay home


We’ll put on bug spray and we'll lose our clothes
Put out the lawn chairs and turn on the hose
We’ll play Jack Johnson, he’s the new Don Ho
And we’ll go surfing, surfing, we'll surf the radio


But you make it easy, easy, easy to get away
Sit in the sun and drink beer all day
Because it's easy, easy, easier anyway
Hey, who needs Mexico?
Baby, let's stay home


Drink margaritas and take in the sunset
Later on we'll slip up to our king size bed
And make love, love, sweet love


You make it easy, easy
Oh, yes, it's easy, easy


But you make it easy, easy, easy to get away
Sit in the sun and drink beer all day
Because it's easy, easy, easier anyway
Hey, who needs Mexico?
Baby, let's stay home


Let's get away baby
Oh, let's get away, baby
Oh...
Go on a little holiday...
