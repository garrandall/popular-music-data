I'm standing on the bridge
I'm waiting in the dark
I thought that you'd be here by now
There's nothing but the rain
No footsteps on the ground
I'm listening, but there's no sound


Isn't anyone trying to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?


It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand?
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you
I'm with you


I'm looking for a place
I'm searching for a face
Is anybody here I know?
'Cause nothing's going right
And everything's a mess
And no one likes to be alone


Isn't anyone trying to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?


It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand?
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you
I'm with you


Yeah-yeah, oh, why is everything so confusing?
Maybe I'm just out of my mind
Yeah-he-yaa, yeah-he-yah, yeah-he-yah, yeah-he-yah, yeah!


It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand?
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you
I'm with you
Take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you
I'm with you
Take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you
I'm with you
I'm with you
