Who's been telling you these things
Don't you know it's not true
You believe those crazy guys
They deceive you with their lies
They'll make you believe what they want you to

Ooh, darling, look at me
I wouldn't be here if I did not care
I wouldn't hurt you if my life depended on it
Love don't work unless you learn to share it
No, it won't work at all

You got to trust me
Put me in your pocket
It's your lucky day
You'll be fine
Trust me
Plug me in your socket
It's the only way
Love will shine

Oh, I want nothing more
Than to take you in my arms
And to show you I'm true

It's clearly understood
I won't touch if you don't want me to
I know you
Believe me, darling, it's alright

Every time I see you
You know I bleed
'Cause, oh, you seem so scared
You got wounded in the war of hearts
And your love shattered everywhere
Nobody seemed to care

But you can trust me
Put me in your pocket
It's your lucky day
You'll be fine
Trust me; plug me in your socket
It's the only way love will shine
