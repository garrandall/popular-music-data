She's sitting by the water where the river gets wide
Think about swimming to the other side
Got a Malboro red, and a can of cold Bud
Toes squished down in the Arkansas mud


Hey Mister! Yeah, I kissed her
Son, you ought to see her sister!
You've got to give a little something to a cool dark cat
Finding him a woman who could shake like that
Hottie, she's a Hottie! Got a smokin' little body
String bikini and a barbed-wire tat (tattoo)
She's rockin' that cowboy hat
Hottie, she's a Hottie! And just a little bit naughty
Kayay digidigy, Kayay digidigy, yey Hey hey hey Hey


She's slapping down a dam
Where the moss gets thick
Yelling Yee Haw! she's a redneck chick
Spitting in the fire, putting on a show
Strutting like a chicken to the radio
Hey Slick! She's a hick!
Hm and her butter milk lipstick
Give a little something to a cool dark cat
Finding him a woman who could shake like that


Hottie, she's a Hottie! She got a smokin' little body
String bikini and a barbed-wire tat (tattoo)
She's rockin' that cowboy hat
Hottie, she's a Hottie! And just a little bit naughty
Singing Kayay digidigy
Kayay digidigy, yey Hey hey hey Hey


Dress her up boys, I took her from the farm
I brought her downtown, I hung her on my arm
You've got to give a little somethin' to a cool dark cat
Finding him a woman who could walk like that!
She's a Hottie, she's a Hottie! She's got a smokin' little body
String bikini and a barbed-wire tat (tattoo)
She's rocking' that cowboy hat
Hottie, she's a Hottie! And just a little bit naughty
Kayay digidigy, Kayay digidigy, yey
Singing Kayay digidigy, Kayay digidigy
Yey hey Hey hey Hey


Singing Kayay digidigy, Kayay digidigy, Yey Hey hey Hey
