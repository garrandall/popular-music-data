Just keepin' it honest
You wouldn't want a young nigga if I wasn't whippin' this foreign

You gon have to do less when you (do it)
Lil mama you know I (show it)
Always want you to (prove it)
You gon have to do more than just (say it)
You gon have to do less when you (do it)
Lil mama you know I (show it)
So you gon need to more than just (prove it)

And you know, you know
And you know, in this foreign car let it go
And you know, you know

But I'm not sure that you want me
But I now know
You know I know that this ain't right
Cause you want me cause I got dough
Ever since you walked in inside my foreign, slam my door
You know I know that you been on it
But I been on it, on the low

So let a young nigga get down on it, yeah
Love when you spin round on it, yeah
Even though a young nigga want you

Gots to break it down for you to let you know
You know it's things you know I'm down for
Ain't goin' act like you ain't bout
My door you know ain't open girl you know I'm down for
Take your time to find you out
Won't hesitate to take the time to waste no baby
Bringin' out the foreign out to play
You know it's things it takes

So let a young nigga get down on it, yeah
Love when you spin round on it, yeah
Even though a young nigga want you

All I wanna do is, come close to you
You make me come thru, I get so close to you
