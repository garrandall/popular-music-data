Ding dong, the witch is dead
Which old witch?
The wicked witch!
Ding dong, the wicked witch is dead

Heigh-ho, the derry-o
Sing it high, sing it low
Ding dong, the wicked witch is dead

She's gone where the goblins go
Below, below, below
Yo-ho, let's open up and sing
And ring some bells out

Ding dong, the witch is dead
Which old witch?
The wicked witch!
Ding dong, the wicked witch is dead

She's gone where the goblins go
Below, below, below
Yo-ho, let's open up and sing
And ring some bells out

- Interlude -

She's gone where the goblins go
Below, below, below
Yo-ho, let's open up and sing
And ring some bells out

Ding dong, the witch is dead
Which old witch?
The wicked witch!
Ding dong, the wicked witch is dead

Heigh-ho, the derry-o
Sing it high, sing it low
Ding dong, the wicked witch is dead
(Ding dong, the wicked witch is dead)
Ding dong, the wicked witch is dead
