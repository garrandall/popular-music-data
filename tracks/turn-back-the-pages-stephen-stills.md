I thought I knew you
I guess I took myself
Right down the wrong road
Leading to the past
I know you're trying
To rearrange your mind
But you were lying
Do you laugh in my face

Turn back turn back the pages
Who remembers names
Who remembers faces
Turn back don't drive yourself crazy
Life's too short for ritualistic chases

Maybe tomorrow
You'll find you have to cry
And in your sorrow
See the mirror it doesn't lie
Just like the last time
You try to pull me down
You are the past time
And blind and death to sound

Turn back turn back the pages
Who remembers names
Who remembers faces
Turn back don't drive yourself crazy
Life's too short for repetitious changes

No use denying
You wasted my time
And caused the crying
And the bitterness to hide

Just trying to prove
You need nobody else
But you're bound to lose
Lying to yourself

Turn back turn back the pages
Who remembers names
Who remembers faces
Turn back don't drive yourself crazy
Life's too short for ritualistic chases
Turn back turn back turn back the pages
