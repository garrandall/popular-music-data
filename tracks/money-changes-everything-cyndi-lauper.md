She said I'm sorry baby I'm leaving you tonight
I found someone new he's waitin' in the car outside
Ah honey how could you do it
We swore each other everlasting love
She said well yeah I know but when 
We did - there was one thing we weren't
Really thinking of and that's money

Money changes everything 
Money, money changes everything
We think we know what we're doin'
That don't mean a thing
It's all in the past now
Money changes everything

They shake your hand and they smile
And they buy you a drink
They say we'll be your friends
We'll stick with you till the end
Ah but everybody's only 
Looking out for themselves 
And you say well who can you trust
I'll tell you it's just
Nobody else's money

Money changes everything
Money changes everything
We think we know what we're doin'
We don't pull the strings
It's all in the past now
Money changes everything

Money changes everything
Money changes everything
We think we know what we're doing
We don't know a thing 
It's all in the past now

Money changes everything
Money changes everything
Money changes everything
