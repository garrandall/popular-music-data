Well, baby love's just one of those words that gets thrown around
Like Jack and Coke, sitting on the bar when it gets watered down
So I ain't gonna say it, oh but I ain't gonna lie
If you wanna know the truth how I feel about you tonight

If you were my last breath, I'd just wanna hold ya
If you were my last night of hell on wheels, I'd wanna drive you like I stole ya
If you were my last shot, last shot of whiskey
I'd press you to my lips, take a little sip
Swirl you around and around and around
Then I'd shoot you down

So baby let me look at you and see just what I got
If you were my cherry stem I'd tie you in a knot
And if I couldn't hail you, oh baby I'd be gone
I'd be floating round high as the Colorado sky blowing smoke rings all night long

If you were my last breath, I'd just wanna hold ya
If you were my last night of hell on wheels, I'd wanna drive you like I stole ya
If you were my last shot, of whiskey
I'd press you to my lips, take a little sip
Swirl you around and around and around
Then I'd shoot you down

Last call, last chance, last dance I was ever gonna get to take

If you were my last breath, I'd just wanna hold ya
My last night of hell on wheels, wanna drive you like I stole ya
If you were my last shot, of whiskey
I'd press you to my lips, take a little sip
Swirl you around and around and around
Then I'd shoot you down
Then I'd shoot you down

Well, if you were my last breath
Well, I'd just wanna hold ya
