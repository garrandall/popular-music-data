I'm feelin' so cool
Top to the bottom, just cool
Every little thing that I do
Dammit, I'm feelin' so coo-oo-ool, yeah

Woke up feelin' like a new James Dean
I combed my hair like an old school scene
I'm feelin' high like a late night summer of last year, yeah
Standing there with the red dress on ya
A killer queen like a young Jane Fonda
Is it me or am I just having a good year?

Lately I've been feelin' so cool (cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (cool)
Every little thing that I do (do)
Dammit, I'm feelin' so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool
It's like oh (oh)
Maybe I should bottle my moves (moves)
Sell 'em for a dollar or two (two)
Dammit, I'm feelin' so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool (cool)

Must have done something right 'cause all these
Lights are green, man, they look like palm trees
And every time that song comes on it's about me
Oh, I feel like Post Malone when I get home
Sittin' there, winning like it's Game of Thrones
And now that we've made it, how complicated was last year?

Lately I've been feelin' so cool (cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (cool)
Every little thing that I do (do)
Dammit, I'm feelin' so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool
It's like oh (oh)
Maybe I should bottle my moves (moves)
Sell 'em for a dollar or two (two)
'Cause dammit, I'm feelin' so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool (cool)

(Cool)
(Cool)
(Cool)

Woke up feelin' like a new James Dean
I combed my hair like and old school scene
When I grow up, I wanna be just like me

Lately I've been feelin' so cool (cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (cool)
Every little thing that I do (I do)
Dammit, I'm feelin' so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool
It's like oh (oh)
Maybe I should bottle my moves (my moves)
Sell 'em for a dollar or two (two)
'Cause dammit, I'm feelin' so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool (cool)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Cool
