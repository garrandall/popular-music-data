Eleven times I been busted, eleven times I been to jail
Some of the times I been there nobody could go my bail
Well it seems to me, Lord that this ol' boy just don't fit
Well I can jump in a rosebush and come out smelling like sh...

Those misters dressed in blue never done so right by me
Some of the times I was innocent but the judge said guilty
I'm not one to complain now son I tell you true
When the black cat cross your trail, Lord
It comes in misery times two


Double trouble--that's what my friends all call me
(Double trouble)
I said, double trouble
T-R-O-U-B-L-E

Well I was born down in the gutter
With a temper as hot as fire
Spent ninety days on a peat farm just doin' the county's time
Well now, even mama said Son you're bad news
And it won't be too long before someone puts one through you
