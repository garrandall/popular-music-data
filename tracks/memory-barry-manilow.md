Midnight,
Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight the withered leaves collect
At my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory
All alone in the moonlight
I cam smile at the old days
It was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
Daylight,
I must wait for a sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I musn't give in
When the dawn comes tonight will be
A memory too

And a new day will begin
Burnt out ends of smokey days
The stale cold smell of morning
The streetlamp dies
Another night is over Another day is dawning
Touch me,
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my day in the sun
If you touch me you'll understand what
Happiness is
Look a new day has begun

Memory
All alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days It was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
