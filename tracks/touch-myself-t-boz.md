Look at all these haters surrounding me every day 
hatin on a baller but they can't stop my pay 
stop all the hatin I can't take it no more 
Im just tryin to get mine you best get yours so what you hatin for 


Pop the lock on the benz with the keys 
To high to see his own enemies 
his baby mama with him in a short skirt 
his last ride was in a car, i mean a black hearse 
his friend took his life for the mighty dollar 
then ran through the alley must have been a coward 
No more hit 'em up like in the old days 
homies scrab with Mack 10s and AKs 
that's why I roll by myself I mean I'm a loner 
cause haters be all up on me 
tryin to sniff you out for your cheddar and your cheese 
and the same niggas wanna blow on your weed 
set you up for a caper 
dont wanna see you make no money then take ya 
gotta figure out how to get what you got 
cause haters be the same niggas on the spot 




How do hatin get started? 
It started by the jealous people 
and they get mad over the things you have 
and the things they'll never have 
Tell me if you hustle it really aint hard to get 
You can get yours I got mine so stay out my mix 
I heard you spreading rumors 
Im really not impressed 
I tell you only one time 
with my scrilla fool dont mess 


I only get with a few cause these bitch made niggas is actors 
see I dont had to many gun-ins, run-ins with these ass backwards 
non-packers 
I'm strapped like P or C 
they ask for me 
capture me 
but im going out with a blast 
I put that on some cash 
I'm standing last 
for some ass 
yall young crazed punks are trippin 
dont hate me nigga just go ahead and credit my ?? 
I'm admitting 
that I'm not only on the thwat 
but I know i got stopped 
on tha ?? 
and its understood that I'm not 
one of the best niggas that ever lived 
but I got some advice to give 
and that is 




I wonder why they hatin for? Probably cause we got G's, 
mad cause we makin moves, cause we got keys 
But really I cant fade them 
Cause truly you need haters up on you to know you'se a motherfuckin playa 
I know yall gonna kill me in a matter of lies 
I got friend that will turn to enemies in a matter of time 
I know most of my niggas can feel me 
when I say TRU niggas will never try to kill me 
But keep my eyes up on my enemies I gotta watch my friends 
like when I'm sittin on top or ridin in a benz 
Why dont yall go out yall's ass up and get something 
dont worry about how i got mines 
always tryin to point a finger and say thats not mine. 
and kill me 
it kills me 
its digusting cause I got a few G's 
they try to rob me 
but they know they wont touch me 
smile in your face and talk shit behind your back 
but I just cant call it or catch 
but i still got G's and Im still ballin
