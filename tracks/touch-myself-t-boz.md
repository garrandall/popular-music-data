Intro

Oh, oh I, oh I
Oh, oh I, oh I
Verse 1

When you're alone what you do is what you do
I'm not scared to say
When you're alone don't you ever get confused
Ain't nothing wrong with making it feel good baby
Chorus 1

I won't be afraid to touch myself
It's all right
I said it's all right
I don't think it's wrong to touch yourself
Ain't nothing wrong with making it feel good
Chrous 2-

Every night I get away
And I think about it baby
You are on my mind
I ain't afraid to touch myself
I don't need nobody else

It's you baby, it's you baby
Verse 2

When you're alone what you need is what you need
One time ecstasy
People say it's not the thing to do
But that's the safest way to making it feel good
Hey I
Chorus 1

Chorus 2

Chorus 2

Outro

Baby, hey oh
Oh, oh I, oh I
I don't need nobody baby
I don't need nobody baby
I don't need nobody baby
No no no no no
Nobody baby
I don't need nobody baby
