Freedom, this is what I call freedom

Well, I wanna say, I wanna tell you
I wanna say when you can do what you wanna do
And go where you wanna go
And live where you wanna live
And love who you wanna love

And be what you wanna be
Join what you wanna join
Well, well, well, that's freedom
Yeah, yeah, freedom, yes sir

When you can learn what you wanna learn
And read what you wanna read
(Free, free, free)

And write what you wanna write
(Free, free, free)
Do what you feel is right
(Free, free, free)

Hey, hey, hey, hey, freedom, freedom
Oh yeah, freedom, freedom, freedom
Oh yeah, freedom, oh that's freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom, oh yeah

Free, free, free
Free, free, free
Free, free, free
Free, free, free

When you can eat what you wanna eat
And sleep where you wanna sleep
And say what you wanna say
I like the children play what they wanna play

And work when you wanna work
Flirt when you wanna flirt
Oh, that's freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom

When you can laugh when you wanna laugh
And cry when you wanna cry
(Free, free, free)

And don't have to feel ashamed
(Free, free, free)
Sing the song you wanna sing
(Free, free, free)

When you can buy what you wanna buy
(Free, free, free)
When no one to ask you why
(Free, free, free)

Dress the way you wanna dress
(Free, free, free)
Just because you feel the space
(Free, free, free)

Rock the way you wanna rock
(Free, free, free)
Talk the way you wanna talk
(Free, free, free)

Shake the way you wanna shake
(Free, free, free)
No one to put you at
(Free, free, free)

Oh, that's freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom, oh yeah
Freedom, that's freedom, freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom

Freedom, oh, freedom, freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom, freedom
