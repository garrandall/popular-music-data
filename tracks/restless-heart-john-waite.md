Three years come
I'm still alone and you're so lonely
I look in the mirror
I see those lines on my face
All of my dreams are gone
Flyin' with the starlings
But they were not stolen gems
Colored glass I can replace 
You've got a restless heart
Restless change is blowing
through your life
Tears in your eyes
Tears in the books that I've been reading
I don't understand you now
And I never did
But I still love your restless heart 
Days into nights 
Nights into days
Lights flicker 'round me
And down to the shore I walk
I'm haunted by your face
Ungracious moves I've made
Just like a broken dancer
If I could get you back
They are steps I would retrace 
You've got a restless heart
Restless change is blowing through your life
Tears in your eyes
Tears in the books that I've been reading
I don't understand you now
And I never will
But I still love your restless heart 
Three years come 
You're still alone and I'm so alone
And I would give anything
To feel my heart beat again
I wouldn't say that I've been losin' time
I've been dreaming
And I'd give up anything to keep you as my friend 
You've got a restless heart
Restless change is blowing through your life
Tears in your eyes
Tears in the books I've been reading
I don't understand you now
And I never did
But I love you 
And I know you've got a restless heart
(Restless heart) 
I know you've got a restless heart (in you)
(Restless heart) 
I know (in you)
You got a restless heart (heart)
And I know it (in you)
You got a restless heart (heart)
you got a restless heart (in you)
I know it (heart)
But I'm just like you (in you)
Just like you
