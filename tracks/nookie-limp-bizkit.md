I came into this world as a reject
Look into these eyes
Then you'll see the size of the flames (size of the flames)
Dwellin' on the past, past
It's burnin' up my brain
Everyone that burns has to learn from the pain

Hey, I think about the day (days)
My girlie ran away with my pay
When fellas came to play (play)
Now she's stuck with my homies that she fucked
And I'm just a sucker with a lump in my throat, hey,

Like a chump, hey 

Should I be feelin' bad? No
Should I be feelin' good? No
It's kinda sad I'm the laughin' stock of the neighborhood
And you would think that I'd be movin' on (move it)
But I'm a sucker like I said
Fucked up in the head, not!!
And maybe she just made a mistake
And I should give her a break
My heart will ache either way
Hey, what the hell
What you want me to say?
I won't lie that I can't deny


I did it all for the nookie
C'mon
The nookie
C'mon
So you can take that cookie
And stick it up yourâyeah!
Stick it up yourâyeah!
Stick it up yourâyeah!
Stick it up yourâ

Why did it take so long?
Why did I wait so long, huh?
To figure it out? But I did it
And I'm the only one underneath the sun who didn't get it
I can't believe that I could be deceived (but you were)
By my so-called girl, but in reality
Had a hidden agenda
She put my tender heart in a blender
And still I surrendered

Hey, like a chump 


I did it all for the nookie
C'mon
The nookie
C'mon
So you can take that cookie
And stick it up yourâyeah!
Stick it up yourâyeah!
Stick it up yourâyeah!
Stick it up yourâ

I'm only human
It's so easy for your friends to give you their advice
They'll tell you to let it go
But it's easier said than done
I appreciate it
I do, but just leave me alone
Leave me alone
Just leave me alone!
Just leave me alone!

Nothin' gonna change
You can go away
I'm just gonna stay here and always be the same

Ain't nothin' gonna change
'Cause you can go away
I'm just gonna stay here and always be the same

Ain't nothin' gonna change
'Cause you can go away
I'm just gonna stay here and always be the same


I did it all for the nookie
C'mon
The nookie
C'mon
So you can take that cookie
And stick it up yourâyeah!
Stick it up yourâyeah!
Stick it up yourâyeah!
Stick it up yourâ
