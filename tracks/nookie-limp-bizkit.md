Check 1, 1, 2

I came into this world as a reject
Look into the eyes
Then you'll see the size of the flames (size of the...)
Dwellin' on the past (past)
It's burnin' up my brain (hot)
Everyone that burns has to learn from the pain
Hey, I think about the day (days)
My girlie ran away with my pay
When fellas came to play (play)
Now she's stuck with my homies that she fucked
And I'm just a sucker with a lump in my throat

(Hey) Like a chump
(Hey) Like a chump
(Hey) Like a chump
(Hey) Like a chump
(Hey) Like a chump
(Hey) Like a chump
(Hey) Like a chump
(Hey)

Should I be feelin' bad? (No)
Should I be feelin' good? (No)
It's kinda sad I'm the laughin' stock of the neighborhood
And you would think that I'd be movin' on (movin')
But I'm a sucker like I said, fucked up in the head (not)
And maybe she just made a mistake
And I should give her a break
My heart will ache either way
Hey, what the hell what you want me to say?
I won't lie that I can't deny

I did it all for the nookie
(Come on) The nookie
(Come on) So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your (yeah)
Stick it up your (yeah)
Stick it up your (yeah)
Stick it up your
I did it all for the nookie
(Come on) The nookie
(Come on) So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your (yeah)
Stick it up your (yeah)
Stick it up your (yeah)
Stick it up your

Why did it take so long?
Why did I wait so long, huh?
To figure it out? But I did it
And I'm the only one
Underneath the sun who didn't get it
I can't believe that I could be deceived (but you were)
By my so called girl (but in reality...)
Had a hidden agenda
She put my tender heart in a blender
And still I surrendered

(Hey) Like a chump
(Hey) Like a chump
(Hey) Like a chump
(Hey) Like a chump
(Hey) Like a chump
(Hey) Like a chump
(Hey) Like a chump

I did it all for the nookie
(Come on) The nookie
(Come on) So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your (yeah)
Stick it up your (yeah)
Stick it up your (yeah)
Stick it up your
I did it all for the nookie
(Come on) The nookie
(Come on) So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your (yeah)
Stick it up your (yeah)
Stick it up your (yeah)
Stick it up your

I'm only human
It's so easy for your friends
To give you their advice
They'll tell you just let it go
But it's easier said than done
I appreciate it, I do, but
Just leave me alone
Leave me alone
Just leave me alone

Ain't nothin' gonna change
You can go away
I'm just gonna stay here and always be the same
Ain't nothin' gonna change
'Cause you can go away
And I'm just gonna stay here and always be the same
Ain't nothin' gonna change
And you can go away
I'm just gonna stay here and always be the same

I did it all for the nookie
(Come on) The nookie
(Come on) So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your (yeah)
Stick it up your (yeah)
Stick it up your (yeah)
Stick it up your
I did it all for the nookie
(Come on) The nookie
(Come on) So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your (yeah)
Stick it up your (yeah)
Stick it up your (yeah)
Stick it up your
