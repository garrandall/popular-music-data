Well I dreamed I saw the knights in armour coming saying something about
A queen
There were peasants singing and drummers drumming and the archer split
The tree
There was a fanfare blowing to the sun that was floating on the breeze
Look at mother nature on the run in the nineteen-seventies
I was lying in a burned out basement with a full moon in my eyes
I was hoping for a replacement when the sun burst through the skies
There was a band playing in my head and I felt like getting high
I was thinking about what a friend had said I was hoping it was a lie
Thinking about what a friend had said I was hoping it was a lie
Well I dreamed I saw the silver spaceships flying in the yellow haze of
The sun
There were children crying and colors flying all around the chosen one
All in a dream, all in a dream the loading had begun
They were flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home in the sun
Flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home in the sun
