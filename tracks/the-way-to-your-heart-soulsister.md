Woke up this morning with my heart on fire
Held on to what I'd been dreaming
Woke up this morning I had one desire
To get back to what I'd been seeing
Heaven, it was heaven
I have never know any like this
Witnessed anything like this
Growing all over as I started on my shift
I thought that I heard somebody calling
Heaven, it was heaven
Now I know I've seen the light
Make it go on shining


I keep on searching for the way to your heart
Try to believe it's getting better
Please, take me all the way to your heart
I want you... (ohohoho)


Alas we kisses, all the gentleness
That I'm being shared all around it
Only remind me of my of my only stress
No loving arms to surround me
Falling, I am falling
You can help me out of there
Being mine forever


I keep on searching for the way to your heart
Try to believe it's getting better
Please, take me all the way to your heart
I want you... (ohohoh)


You got it, you got it
There'll be no doubt about it
Nobody's going keep me from you - oh
I want you, I need you
I'll find a way to get through
Nobody is going keep me from you - uhuh


Heaven, it was heaven
Now I know I've seen the light
Make it go on shining


I keep on searching for the way to your heart
Try to believe it's getting better
Please, take me all the way to your heart
I want you... (ohohoho)
I keep on searching for the way to your heart
Try to believe it's getting better
Please, take me all the way to your heart
I want you, I want you... (ohohoho)
