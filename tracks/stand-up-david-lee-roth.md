Punch the train from Racine to old Bellago, oh yeah
Comin' down from Brownsville, Baltmore
El Paso fly, better step aside, oh
Talkin' 'bout Miami to the top handle of New York
1, 2, 3, 4

My train, your station
Full speed across the nation
You'll be brownin' your Bermudas
When I blow this tomb with a view, yeah all right

Third rail, can't stand it
Santa Fe to the mid-Atlantic
I got a steel-wheeled radial
Prophylactic for you, yeah
Ain't afraid to use it now

It takes up all your time
Being leader of the pack
Just when you get that rat race licked
Well, here come faster rats

(Big train) Are you an engineer?
(Big train) Or a passanger?
(Big train) Whatever gets you to the top of the hill
You're on a (big train) strapped to the front of a
(Big train) Double stack thunder
And you're runnin' just in front of the wheels, oh

I've known fast livin'
And I know wine, women and song
Become a long locomotive for me
Oh yeah

That train be rollin'
Not me, I'm going before wine and women
Turn into beer, the old lady and TV

All you ever wanted
Was to tap dance, run away
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
Sometimes it rains right on your

(Big train) Time gets movin'
(Big train) When ya' don't know what you're doin'
(Big train) And you're wonderin' if you ever will
(Big train) Oh, honey are with me?
(Big train) Or is the train doin sixty?
(Big train) Or maybe you're standing still, look out

(Big train) Gets movin'
(Big train) Don't know what you're doin'
(Big train) And you're wonderin' if you ever will, woah
(Big train) Honey, are ya with me?
(Big train) Or is the train doin sixty, baby
Or maybe you're standing still

Always another train pulling into that station
And I'll be smilin' again
Can't help it
That's the kind of guy I am
Awe reap!
