Everybody listen up cuz I'm about to get my speak on
Fools be trippin' when it's time to get their freak on
Runnin' round town
Puttin' it down
Without no protection
Funny erection
When it's time for selection
What's your direction?
Before you make a choice you betta do some inspection
If you don't know my aim, an'
Don't know my game, then
Let me explain now
Aiesha slept wit' Mark
Then Mark slept wit' Tina
Then Tina slept wit' Javier
An' the first time he seen her
Javier slept wit' Loopy
An' Loopy slept wit' Rob
Cuz he was rollin' on beeds and had a goodass job
Rob slept wit' Lisa who slept wit' Steve, an'
Steve was positive
H.I.V.
What started off as a plan
Ended up in the plot
Ya betta cool ya ass off
Cuz it's too damn hot...


Oh It's Too Hot
Too hot
Too Hot lady
Too hot
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's Too Hot
Too hot
Too Hot homie
Too hot
Gotta make some sense from this mess that we made

Your doin' everything momma told ya not to do
Now you're tryin' to walk away cuz ya know it's true
Your sister can't explain, an'
Your mother's ashamed
to admit you both had the same last name
I don't have to ask you where you've been
Cuz the matches in your purse say Holiday Inn
A mind is a terrible thing to waste that was the slogan
But now it's '95 and it's don't forget the Trojan
Explained it to her momma
Before somebody get her got her
Help her to the game with those smooth talkin' niggas
'Love' is the word
So is 'remember' it often heard
Latex
Safe sex
You better learn to get hip to the facts
Before you be yacko
End up in a box on your back
Sometimes ya axed me what you wanted
Get what you got
Don't get up in the plot
It's too damn hot...



Another day in the city, an'
Know what a pity
Even though we did our duty things are still lookin' shitty
Everybody in the packstack tryin' to make some scraps
Walkin' in the rain but they ain't got no hat
Understand how we livin' in the 90's loc
Nuclear waste, cannibalism, and pistol smoke
Sex, lies, and videotape and rape
Just a little public crime can seal your fate
We need to do something drastic shit
It's gettin' tragic
And if you don't believe me
Then go ask Magic
Everybody and their momma preaching abstenence, these
Kids ain't checking for abster shit
So put a condom in their hand and hope it don't bust
Another victim of the lust
In God we trust
What started off as a plan
Ended up in the plot
Water can't cool it off cuz it's too damn hot...
