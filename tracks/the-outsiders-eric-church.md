Theyâre the in crowd, weâre the other ones
Itâs a different kind of cloth that weâre cut from
We let our colors show, where the numbers ainât
Weâre the paint where there ainât supposed to be paint

Thatâs who we are
Thatâs how we roll
The Outsiders, The Outsiders

Our women get hot, and our leather gets stained
When we saddle up and ride 'em in the pouring rain
Weâre the junkyard dogs, weâre the alley cats
Keep the wind at our front, and the hell at our back

Thatâs who we are
We do our talking, walk that walk
Wide open rocking
Thatâs how we roll

Our backs to the wall
A band of brothers
Together, alone, the Outsiders
Weâre the riders, weâre the ones burning rubber off our tires.
Yeah, weâre the fighters, the all-nighters
So fire 'em up and get a lil higher

Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh



Weâre the bad news
Weâre the young guns
Weâre the ones that they told you to run from
Yeah, the playerâs gonna play, and a haters gonna hate
And a regulators born to regulate
When it hits the fan, and it all goes down
And the gloves come off
Youâre gonna find out just

Who we are
We do our talking, walk that walk
Wide open rocking
Thatâs how we roll

Our backs to the wall 
A band of brothers
Together, alone, the outsiders

Weâre the riders, weâre the ones burning rubber off our tires
Yeah, weâre the fighters, the all-nighters
So fire 'em up and get a lil higher

Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
The Outsiders
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
The Outsiders
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Youâre gonna know who we are



Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
The Outsiders
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh



Thatâs who we are
