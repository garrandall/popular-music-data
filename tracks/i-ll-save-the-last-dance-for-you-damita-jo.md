If I dance ev'ry dance with the guys who give me the eye
And let 'em hold me tight
Please don't mind, if I smile at the man who holds my hand
'neath the pale moonlight

I won't forget who's takin' me home and you should remember, too
That I'm savin' the last dance for you
Mm I know (oh I know) that the music's (yes I know) fine
Like sparklin' (oh I know) wine but my mind's (yes I know) on you (oh I know)

I can tell (yes I know) by the way (oh I know) you look (yes I know) at me
That you're thinking, too (oh I know) (yes I know)
I won't forget that you're taking me home when the night is through
So I'm savin' the last dance for you

Baby, don't you know I love you so?
Can't you feel it when we touch?
I will never, ever let you go
I love you oh so much

It's my dance (you can dance) and I'll carry (you can dance)on
Until the night (you can dance) is gone and it's just for fun (you can dance) (you can dance)
And you know (you can dance) when it's time (you can dance) to go
You'll be (you can dance) the one to take (you can dance) me home (you can dance)

Don't want to give my goodnight kiss to anyone but you
So I'm savin' the last dance for you
Don't want to give my goodnight kiss to anyone but you
So I'm savin' the last dance for you

Hmm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Savin' the last dance for you
