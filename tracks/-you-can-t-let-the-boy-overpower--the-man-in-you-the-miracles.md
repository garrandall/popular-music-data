No don't you know my daddy told me
Told me right from the start
About youth
He said no matter how old a man is
He's partly a boy in his heart
Yeah, and that's the truth

He said you'd be surprised by the things you do now
That you're still gonna do
Oh, but you will

Like when it comes to the way
You treat your woman
You can't let the boy overpower the man in you

Oh, let me tell you that
Every man, has to understand
That you can go out with the fellas
But if the boy tells ya, stay late
Yeah, late at night

You know that if you stop to think about it
The man in you is gonna say when
'Cause it isn't right
Oh, you'd be surprised by the things
That a man who loves his woman, won't do
Oh, but you will
'Cause when it comes to the way
You treat your woman
You can't let the boy overpower the man in you

Just one more thing now that
All guys gotta realize
That they are many pretty women
But if a boy ever looks their way, yeah
And winks an eye
You know that if you stop to think about it
The man in you is gonna feel bad
Come on and pass them by

Oh, you'd be surprised by the girls
Who walk on over at you too
Oh, but you will
But when it comes to the way
That you treat your woman
You can't let the boy overpower the man in you

You know, you know, you know you can't
No no, the man in you
