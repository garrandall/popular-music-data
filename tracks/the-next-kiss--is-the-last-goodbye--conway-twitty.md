Time to say goodbye I know I've said it before
Though I hate to go I can't be hurt anymore
You've never seen me with a tear in my eye
The next kiss is the last goodbye

When I'm not around there's someone else you can call
Half a love is worse than havin' nothin' at all
I needed your love and darlin' that's why
The next kiss is the last goodbye

No more holding hands no more whispering words tenderly
Know it breaks my heart there's no way for me

Time to say goodbye is nothing else that I can do
Wish you all the luck with your somebody knew
If I said I'd forget I'd be telling a lie
The next kiss is the last goodbye
Just one more kiss and then baby goodbye
