Call me, were the last words I remember
Then the spring became December
And I still got no reply

Politely, I would ask whoever knew ya
What it was that I did to ya
But they all knew less than I

If this letter doesn't make it clear
Its been a cold and lonely year
In my empty bed, in my head I can feel you near

Oh, I just can't get you out of my mind
Don't you have a heart, I've served my time
Oh, it just ain't right what I'm goin' through
Ten to one, I'm bettin', girl there's no forgettin' you

It's funny on the outside love was showin'
And I had no way of knowin'
You were all mixed up inside

Oh baby, if we'd only done some talkin'
You could've saved yourself some walkin'
Well, I guess they call that pride

I swear you haven't been away too long
I can still hear your favorite song
This was once your home, on my own now, it feels all wrong

Oh, I just can't get you out of my mind
Don't you have a heart, I've served my time
Oh, it just ain't right what I'm goin' through
Ten to one, I'm bettin', girl there's no forgettin' you

Oh, baby  oh sugar
If this letter doesn't make it clear
It's been a cold and lonely year
In my empty bed, in my head I can feel you near

Oh, I just can't get you out of my mind
Don't you have a heart, I've served my time
Oh, it just ain't right what I'm goin' through
Ten to one, I'm bettin', girl there's no forgettin' you

Oh, I just can't get you out of my mind
Don't you have a heart, I've served my time
Oh, it just ain't right what I'm goin' through
Ten to one, I'm bettin', girl there's no forgettin' you
