This shit right here sound like some gospel
I lost my daddy the same week that they lost Nipsey
Ain't got no love left in my heart, my shit be empty
I'm ready to fire on all my opps, let a nigga tempt me
And the day I die, I bet Lil Jon going down in history

('Cause I been solo, riding dolo, I been stuntin')
(No hoe, it's a no go, I don't want you)
And everybody wondering why he come around and don't say nothing
('Cause' he be so alone, it's been so long, I can't feel nothing)

Let me pop my shit
I came from shit, three of us and my mom, she couldn't pay rent
Two jobs, all alone, she couldn't quit
We was home alone when we was jits
That's before I was grown, before I was on
I ain't have no shoes, I ain't have no clothes
Let me wear your shoes, let me fuck your bitch
I ain't have no car, I ain't have no whip
Wonder why a nigga cover his ears when y'all talk
'Cause' it ain't nobody that can tell me shit
I just spent 30K on my daughter birthday
Everybody had fun, nigga everybody lit
When a nigga go home, I don't answer my phone
Everybody wanna leach, everybody want a loan
Everybody wanna talk, everybody wanna click
I don't wanna be friends, nigga get off my dick
I ain't have time to think, I ain't have time to breathe
I been praying to the Lord, I been talking on my knees
I been thinking bout my pops, I been thinking bout my opps
Thinking how I can stop me a nigga when he breathe
When a nigga play with me, I ain't looking for my phone
I ain't finna drive away, I ain't looking for my keys
The fuck these niggas know about me?

This shit right here sound like some gospel
I lost my daddy the same week that they lost Nipsey
Ain't got no love left in my heart, my shit be empty
I'm ready to fire on all my opps, let a nigga tempt me
And the day I die, I bet Lil Jon going down in history

('Cause I been solo, riding dolo, I been stuntin')
(No hoe, it's a no go, I don't want you)
And everybody wondering why he come around and don't say nothing
('Cause' he be so alone, it's been so long, I can't feel nothing)

Put yourself in my shoes
Like I abandoned the race
And you ran in my place
Shoes too big but they use hair strands as a lace, and they break
When it's hot outside, you don't want fans in your face
When you might want a fan in your face
When ya man got a heat and a hand on the waist (Band)
Gotta keep a cool head, niggas got PTSD these days
Some folks ain't live to see these days
I be in the lab like Dex, coolin', taking these Dee Dee breaks
Long, the PD way, I can write a book like TD Jakes
Walking around my city in some house shoes
Know they always wanted someone they could honk and shout too
Just gotta remember got a family and a house too
Don't get caught up with the one that's still function without you

This shit right here sound like some gospel
I lost my daddy the same week that they lost Nipsey
Ain't got no love left in my heart, my shit be empty
I'm ready to fire on all my opps, let a nigga tempt me
And the day I die, I bet Lil Jon going down in history

('Cause I been solo, riding dolo, I been stuntin')
(No hoe, it's a no go, I don't want you)
And everybody wondering why he come around and don't say nothing
('Cause' he be so alone, it's been so long, I can't feel nothing)

I'm the only nigga left, homie
It ain't right how they all went left on me
Niggas took my heart and they stepped on it
Lately, I've been hanging by myself, homie
These fuck niggas make me sick, they got my nauseous
Paranoid, all this money moving cautious
Flipping quarters on the corner to a baller
Run up on Gucci, you gone see the coroner
Bright carrots in my chest, not pointers
Paris fashion week fresh like a foreigner
Nigga tried to rob me now he a goner
Gucci Mane preach that Gospel to the mourners (Wop)

This shit right here sound like some gospel
I lost my daddy the same week that they lost Nipsey
Ain't got no love left in my heart, my shit be empty
I'm ready to fire on all my opps, let a nigga tempt me
And the day I die, I bet Lil Jon going down in history

('Cause I been solo, riding dolo, I been stuntin')
(No hoe, it's a no go, I don't want you)
And everybody wondering why he come around and don't say nothing
('Cause' he be so alone, it's been so long, I can't feel nothing)
