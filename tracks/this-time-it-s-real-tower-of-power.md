Saw me a girl today
Who walk with such a gentle sway
And I knew right from the start
She was the one who can cop my heart
I know someday
That we could happen
In a special way
I wish I may
I wish I might
Make you my all-star shining bright
And I know, I can feel it
This time it's real
Other girls that I had were fine
But they were mainly just to pass the time
Though I must confess I had some fun
Now I know that you're the only one
All I can say girl
Is that I love you each and everyday
And if I may
If I might
I'll make you the all-star of my life
And I know, I can feel it, hey
This time it's real
And I know, I can feel it, hey
This time it's real
Now's the time for me to make my move
Girl we gotsa get in the groove
It's what we do with the what we got
Gonna put us up in the slot
And I hope and pray
We'll get together with no delay
It might be day
It might be night
It don't matter anytime is right
And I know, (Oh) I can feel it (hey)
This time it's real
And I know, (Ah) I can feel it
This time it's real
And I know, I can feel it (yeay)
This time it's real
And I know, I can feel it (yeah child)
This time it's real
And I know, I can feel it (yes)
This time it's real
And I know, I can feel it (hey)
This time it's real
I can feel it
This time it's real
I can feel it
This time it's real
I can feel it
