Walking around looking for a way
But no one tells me which way to go
I'm caught up in a world
A Labyrinth, a maze
Where yes men could easily be known
I ask them no questions
They give me no answers
Following the wise
But they're walking in pampers
Give me a cigarette
Smoking my cancer
Drink the pain away
But I still have no answers


I'm lost on a road
Don't know which way to go
I'm losing my mind
Losing control of the wheel
And I'm swerving
On and off the road
I'm lost on a road
But survival is a must
Don't know who I can trust
I'm livin in a rush
I don't understand this fuss
My brain is bout to bust


I think I'm losin it
I might be losin it
I just might lose
Am I losin my mind?
And I'm so confused I don't know what to do
And I need a clue before I run out of time
Am I losin it?
Am I losin it?
I think I'm losin
I'm losin my mind
Am I losin it?
Am I losin it?
I think I'm losin
I'm losin my mind


I call up my girlfriend she dosen't answer
I hit the strip club and fuck with a dancer
Throwing my ones up, like I'm paying ransom
Told me I look good, she said I was handsome
So believed her, because I am lonely
Im just a loner, my life is a movie
Tonight we're just actors, and this is a sitcom
So tell me you love me, and tell me i'll get some




I'm makin this money
Just to go spend it
Livin the good life
Hope nobody ends it
But who are you kidding?
Ay who are you lying to?
You know if they want you
Best believe they will find you
