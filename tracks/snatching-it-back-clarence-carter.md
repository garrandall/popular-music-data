How can I get your love
When you keep on snatching it back
I need you so bad, I love you, girl
Hit me

How can I get your love
When you keep on snatching it back, oh baby
How can I get your love
When you keep on snatching it back
That's what I want to know
How you expect for me to get it
When you keep on, doing like that

You want me and I want you
But you're afraid that I won't be true
I get your love in the palm of my hand
You change your mind and snatch it back again

So tell me
How can I get your love
When you keep on snatching it back
Oh, I want to know, baby

How can I get your love
When you keep on snatching it back
That's what I want to know right now

How you expect for me to get it
When you keep on doing like that

Some other man, before my time
Must have loved you and left you behind
Now you're afraid that I'll hurt you
But I won't do anything you don't want me to

So tell me
How can I get your love
When you keep on snatching it back

How can I get your love
When you keep on snatching it back
I wanna know right now

Say how can I get your love
When you keep on snatching it back
You don't have to do me like that baby
I wanna know

How can I get your love
When you keep on snatching it back
Oh you know I love you baby

How can I get your love
When you keep on snatching it back
And I need you so bad, I need you so bad, girl

How can I get your love
When you keep on snatching it back
Snatching it back, you keep keep on snatching it back
Oh baby tell me now one time

How can I get your love
When you keep on snatching it back...
