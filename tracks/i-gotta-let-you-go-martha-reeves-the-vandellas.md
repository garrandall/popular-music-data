Boy, you've hurt me for the very last time
You can bet it won't happen again
It's all over town, you've been playing around
This time with my best friend


Boy, no need in explaining
'Cause you'd just be wasting your time
Boy, I've got to let you


I've gotta let you go
Even though I love you


I've got a fella that loves me
Those words I used to proudly say
But you've made me so blue by being untrue
Tell me, what made your love go astray?


Boy, I was better to you, ain't true
Than I was to myself
So I've got to let you


I've gotta let you go
Even though I love you, yeah

I've gotta let you go
Even though I love you


Boy, I've accepted the fact (Oh yeah)
That you no longer belong to me
Though I want you to stay, boy, be on your way
Consider yourself free


Oh baby, I realize, that everyone makes a mistake
But I've got to let you


I've got to let you go
(Even though I love you)
Bye, bye, I've got to let you go, boy
(Even though I love you)


I know I'm gonna cry but I've got to say bye-bye
(Even though I love you)
With tears in my eyes from the hurt I feel inside
(Even though I love you)
Oh, I, I, I've got to let you go, boy
(Even though I love you)
