Doesn't matter who gets the best of who
Or who can hurt who the most, no
It never was meant for it to be that way
Never should be that way at all

The way it is, the way that it goes
Happenin' day after day, yeah
That's the way it is, the way that it goes
Working in the strangest ways

Even though we could never seem to work things out
I still love you just the same
I miss your smile and that sparkle in your eyes
You're so beautiful, never change

The way it is, the way that it goes
Happenin' day after day, yeah
That's the way it is, the way that it goes
Workin' in the strangest ways

What it is and what it was
What shall be shall be, yeah
Sometimes it happens in the strangest ways
Sometimes it's hard to believe, yeah
(Do you believe?) Do you believe
Can you believe?

The way it is, the way that it goes
Workin' in the strangest ways, yeah

Now it really don't matter who, who gets the best of who
It never did and it never will
It was never meant for it to be that way
Why must it be that way at all?

The way it is, the way that it goes
Happenin' day after day, yeah
The way it is, the way that it goes
Workin' in the, workin' in the strangest ways

That's the way it is, that's the way it is
That's the way it is, that's the way that it goes, yeah

Yeah, that's the way it is, that's the way that it goes
That's the way it is, that's the way that it goes
See it happen day after day, yeah, yeah
Workin' in the strangest ways

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Can you believe? Do you believe?
Can you believe? Do you believe?
That's the way it is, that's the way it goes
Yes it do
