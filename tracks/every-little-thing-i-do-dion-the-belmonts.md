Lonely walks
In the park
Counting stars when it gets dark
Every little thing I do
Reminds me of you

Window shop
Dream of things
When I see engagement rings
Every little thing I do
Reminds me of you

Why was I such a fool
I broke each golden rule
But I have changed you'll see
Since you left me

High school dance
Friday night
How I'd love to hold you tight
All night long I'm watching you
Every little thing you do

Let me have
One more chance
And you'll be my one romance
Darling let me share with you
Every little thing I do
