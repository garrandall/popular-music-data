In the midnight moonlight
I'll be walking a long and lonely mile
And every time I do
I keep seeing this picture of you

Here comes my baby, here she comes now
And-a it becomes as no surprise to me
With another guy

Well, here comes my baby, here she comes now
Walking with a love
With a love that's oh so fine
Never to be mine, no matter how I try

You'll never walk alone
And you're forever talking on the phone
I try to call you names
But every time it comes out the shame

Here comes my baby ...
