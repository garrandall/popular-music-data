Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh
Think about it
Yeah Yeah


My granddaddy was a hell of a man
He did some things that were hard to understand
He'd get so drunk that it wasn’t fun now
He's been chewing tobacco and losing lots of money
Granddaddy, every time he was sad
He had a song that he would sing
I like the song he'd sing, it had a lovely ring
It was pleasing to my ears
He was more than what he done
He didn’t give a damn when he was just having fun


Oh yeah, yeah yeah
Hold on
Yeah, yeah


Every time I think about the old man
I want to sing sometimes, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Old granddaddy had some funny ways
He had me laughin' and forever amazed
The things he done wasn't right on
(The things he done weren't right on)
He didn't give a damn 'cause he never stayed home
He had a song he would always sing
That would make him so happy inside
Whenever he was sad
Whenever feeling bad
He'd sing the song from the bottom of his heart


Yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah
Well hey hey, hey hey hey yeah
Oh, wave of addition
We never knew
We never knew, ha ha yeah


My granddaddy was a hell of a man
(Yes he was, yes he was)
He did some things that I didn't understand
But every night he was spinning my nine
He bought whiskey and lots of honeys
He liked them sweet
He liked them fine (Sexy)
That old man he had a hell of a mind


Wave of addition
We never knew
He sang a song
Singing Granddad, yeah
Singing yeah
Gotta say it, say it, say it, say it
Hold on
Every time I think about my grandfather
When it come on, come on
Clap your hands, oh oh, oh oh
Gotta sing a song, sing the song
Sing the song, sing the song
Sing the song, gotta sing the song, come on
Sing the song, sing the song
Sing the song, you can’t stop me now
Can’t stop me, sing the song
Sing the song, oh yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Sing, oh lord, oh lord now
Sing, I-I-I-I-I
Sing
