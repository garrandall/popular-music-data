Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
My wife was calling me (Woh, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh
D.Y
Dirili-Daddy
(Dancing with you; Ozuna; let's go!)


My wife was calling me
But I didn't answer to her (Uah, baby; come on)
Because I was dancing with you
And I forgot about her (Baby)
God forgive me
I don't know why I failed her (I failed; uah)
I was dancing on the disco
And I got distracted with her (Woh, oh, oh; let's go!; uah)


I was dancing on the disco (Oh, oh; hah, prr)
I was dancing on the disco (Eh, eh, eh; uah)
I was dancing on the disco (Uah, uah; eh-eh)
I was dancing on the disco


When I saw her (Woh, oh, oh), I knew she was the one (I knew)
I wanted to dance with her (Woh, oh)
And that the DJ won't turn down the music
She wants to have a good time (Good time)
She doesn't fall in love, she just wants to have fun (To have fun)
She is always alone, she is still self-centered (Still self-centered)
Her provokes me and I fall into her game and it's (I fall)
She wants to have a good time (Good time)
She doesn't fall in love, she just wants to have fun (To have fun)
She is always alone, she is still self-centered (Still self-centered)
Her provokes me and I fall into her game and it's (Haha)


I have a problem with alcohol
I don't know why I am like that (Like that, like that)
Sometimes I think that the doctor was drinking alcohol
The day I was born (Baby, baby)
Baby, put your hands on the floor (Floor)
And play with your hair (Your hair)
Your body is harmful to me (Is harmful)
But I still love you (Baby; let's go!)
You let me fall, but she lifted me (Uah)
Please, leave me, but she lifted me (Oh, oh, oh)
And I got drunk and I forgot about you, eh (Eh), eh (Eh)
You fight a lot and I'm tired of that, eh (Eh), eh (Eh)
(Let's go; come on!)


My wife was calling me
But I didn't answer to her (Uah, baby; come on)
Because I was dancing with you
And I forgot about her (Baby)
God forgive me
I don't know why I failed her (I failed)
I was dancing on the disco
And I got distracted with her (Woh, oh, oh; let's go!; uah)


I was dancing on the disco (Oh, oh; prr)
I was dancing on the disco (Eh, eh; eh, eh, eh)
I was dancing on the disco (Uah, uah; eh-eh)
I was dancing on the disco


Â¡Da-ddy Yan-kee!
You beat me
You got me into your game and you hurt me
I might spend my money with you
I think I am a millionaire throwing money in the air
Because you are beautiful, I flirt
So let's discuss and I never come back, that's why (Rrr!)
I want to go home with you, but you don't let me (Oh, oh, oh)
That baby is a threat, I think you're my partner (Let's go!)
One drink (Hey), two drinks (Hey), the problem started
Because alcohol got into my system (Prr)
Who will say what happened here, will have problems with us
Don't blame me, blame her (Come on!)


I got distracted with you (I got distracted)
And with a couple of drinks, baby
I leave the shyness (I leave the shyness)
I stayed with you and I didn't answer to him
I don't know why I failed (Yeah, yeah)
But I know how delicious I spent it (Ah)
Midnight arrived (Night)
We were just beginning to touch each other (Touch)
Is that my boyfriend was waiting for me
Before twelve o'clock (Twelve)
How good we spent yesterday (Yesterday)
I know I failed and he must forgive me (Eh, eh)
And if I see him again tomorrow (Ah)
I will say that he don't know me


J Balvin, man
I was dancing on the disco
When I got distracted with her, yes (Wouh, wouh)
My wife was calling me
And I had to block her call, and (Auch)
And I don't get carried away (Wouh), baby, you made me fall
That booty that even a blind man can see
And even the holiest wants to be unfaithful (Leggo)


We change the scene (Hey)
From D.R. to Cartagena
I only feel good with you
If having you is bad, I pay my sentence, baby
We change the scene
From D.R. to Cartagena (Come on, come on)
I only feel good with you (Leggo)
If having you is bad, I pay my sentence, yeah (Let's go!)


My wife was calling me
But I didn't answer to her (Uah, baby; come on)
Because I was dancing with you
And I forgot about her (Baby)
God forgive me
I don't know why I failed her (I failed; uah)
I was dancing on the disco
And I got distracted with her (Woh, oh, oh; let's go!; uah; little baby, little baby)


I was dancing on the disco (Oh, oh; hah, prr)
I was dancing on the disco (Eh, eh, eh; uah)
I was dancing on the disco
I was dancing on the disco
