Babe, your love surrounds me but never gives me half a chance
I need a little heart and affection âcause love needs a little romance
And weâll never ever make it if youâre pushinâ me
You gotta back up baby or I might leave
You gotta show me, hold me, and let love breath tonight

Give me the right kind of love, baby
Give me the right kind of love
Give me the right kind of love
And Iâll be yours tonight
Iâll be yours

Baby, you want some kind of promise, well, nothinâ is forever these days
Lovers come and go, friends bought and sold, everything blows away
You know everything is changinâ, baby, overnight
You gotta hold on to love but not too tight
You gotta see it, see itâs not so long but alright

Give me the right kind of love, baby
Give me the right kind of love
Give me the right kind of love
And Iâll be yours tonight
Iâll be yours

Just tell me that love is right and look me in the eye
Iâve gotta know your heart tonight before I give away a piece of my life

Oh! Give me the right kind of love, baby
Give me the right kind of love
Give me the right kind of love, baby
Give me the right kind of love
Oh! Give me the right kind of love, baby
Give me the right kind of love
Give me the right kind of love, baby
Give me the right kind of love
Give me the right kind of love, baby
Give me the right kind of love
Give me the right kind of love, baby
Give me the right kind of love...
