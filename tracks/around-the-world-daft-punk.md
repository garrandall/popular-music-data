Around the world, around the world
Around the world, around the world
Around the world, around the world
Around the world, around the world


Catch us in M.I.A
Cleveland and Dallas
We be European, D-P-Gin' in malice
Roll up the best dro, we here now
Turn up, when you get down
Roll call, all my dogs, spent 10 G's at the strip mall


Round and round we go
Where we stop, no-one will know
Baby it's  Tokyo
Then I, spin the globe, putting my fingers on it
Like a G-6, pop a  on it
Then I zoom straight to  UK, Belgium, then back to France


Around the world, around the world
Around the world, around the world
Around the world, around the world
Around the world, around the world


It was all on you, now it's all on me
All around the world, this is volume three
Me and my cousin, D-A-Z
Ain't too many spots that we don't be
Mad when I play us 
Cute lil' Egyptian, met her in Arabia
Mad when a nigga stop paging her
I had to let her know, I ain't saving ya


You know, we know the flight's shit
Strap it/traffic ten s with the flyest beach
In Dubai, you know we don't  smoking, we high
And then we fly over to the states with the cars we drive
And then we end up at the leopard nine (everyday)
This guy  gon' party like all day long
Who gon' tell him when we end up next?
 beach cmon


Around the world, around the world
Around the world, around the world
Around the world, around the world
Around the world, around the world


All around the world babe
(All around the world babe)
People say the same things
People say they on they own
(People say they on they own)
But they do the same
(But they do the same thing)
All around the world mayne
(All around the world mayne)
Everything's the same game
People say they on they own
But they do the same thing


Around the world, around the world
Around the world, around the world
Around the world, around the world
Around the world, around the world
