Hey big brother, as soon as you arrive
You better, get in touch with the people, big brother
Better get them on your side, big brother
And keep them satisfied

Welcome to the beat of the city street
Walk on now and don't be shy
Take a closer look at the people you meet
And notice the fear in their eyes
Watching the time passing by...

Hey big brother, as soon as you arrive
You better, get in touch with the people, big brother
Better keep them on your side, big brother
Keep them satisfied

Focus your eye on the filthy sky
Just as far as you can see
Everybody's getting kinda tired of waiting
Cause nobody wants to cry
And nobody wants to die...

Hey big brother, as soon as you arrive
You better, get in touch with the people, big brother
And get them on your side, big brother
And keep them satisfied

Now that you've got the picture
What you going to do?
Now that you've got the picture
What you going to do?

Hey big brother, I know you're out there somewhere
If we don't get our thing together, big brother will be watching us
He ain't gonna get me, are you gonna let him get you?
He'll never get me, he'll never get me, no
Big brother's coming
No he'll never get me, no no no no...
Hey big brother
Hey big brother
Hey big brother
...
