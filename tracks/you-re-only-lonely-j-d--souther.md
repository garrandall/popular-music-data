When the world is ready to fall on your little shoulders
And when you're feeling lonely and small
You need somebody there to hold you.
You can call out my name... when you're only lonely
Now, don't you ever be ashamed, you're only lonely

When you need somebody around on the nights that try you
(Remember) I was there when you were a queen
And i'll be the last one there beside you.
So you can call out my name... when you're only lonely.
Now, don't you ever be ashamed, you're only lonely

When the world is ready to fall on your little shoulders
And when you're feeling lonely and small
You need somebody there to hold you.
So don't you ever be ashamed, you're only lonely.
Ah, you can call out my name... when you're only lonely

When you're only lonely...
Ah, it's no crime... darling, we've got lots of time.

Ah, there's nothing wrong with you...
Darling, I get lonely, too.
So if you need me, all you gotta do is call me.
You're only lonely
