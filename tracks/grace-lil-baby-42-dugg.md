Got a lotta new flames need 'em blue
Three hundred fifty thou', times that by two
New down the roof, I still the sky
Peace to my grandma, I still see my guys
Hurtin' this bad must feel like dyin'
Heard a thou' seven hundred, what you gon' bet now?
Yeah, you used to twerk bitch, a vet now
Luke, get up, doggy I need you
Only nigga made sure that I was eatin'
Free Nef still, nigga, RIP Reese
Get her nails done, still charge for the feature
Baby, we ain't that, nah, we ain't this
All that fuckin', I don't do no kiss
Bitch ain't shit, word to my niggas
All in my mansions (Yeah)
Bitch really wanna get higher
Tell the lil' hoes I'm Bryson
I done hit more shit than Mike Tyson
Get popped, nigga, I ain't doin' no fight
Sendin' my cash, I ain't doin' no right


Car too fast, can't stop at no light
I hit the gas, skrrt and I pull off
I'm on they ass, I just took a year off
She shakin' her ass, call me when she get off
Took half a mil' for my lil' bro to get out
That new Richard Mille made me feel like a boss
Feel like I'm Meech when I'm runnin' these cars
Who you know? Pull up, ho, entourage in a foreign?
I got designer for days but it's somethin' about 'em
Go crazy for white Air Force One, maybe 'cause I'm a dope boy
He be live but he ain't makin' no noise
'Ventador on the ground like a skateboard
If I want it, I get it, I pay for it
I pay extra, I ain't tryna wait for it
Everything that I got, it was made for me
I was servin' them trap houses faithfully
Everybody with me gotta eat
Say you grace with me

Thou shall not try one of us, if they do I'ma bust
Please don't reach for no chain
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang
Ran up my check, when I walk in the bank
They greet me at the door by my government name (Hello?)
I made a promise, I'm never gon' change
Rolls Royce umbrella, I'm hopin' it rain, yeah

Right back on it, designer my garments
Corner store mornings, there until the sun down
I don't trust no one, I can't put my gun down
Goin' number one now, how this sound?
Hands down, bands out, pants down, yeah, I'm thuggin'
I done got rich, everybody my cousin
He ain't servin' no packs with me, he ain't my brother
El Chapo go through shit, I call her "The Cutter"
I just bought a new whip, I went bought another
My mother, she happy now
Ain't no cap and gown, but I graduated
Her house paid for, and that new Mercedes
Know you that they been tryna be me lately
I'm a heavy hitter like Gervonta Davis
That shit ain't gon' save 'em, leave 'em on the pavement
All I know is get this motherfuckin' paper

Thou shall not try one of us, if they do I'ma bust
Please don't reach for no chain
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang
Ran up my check, when I walk in the bank
They greet me at the door by my government name (Hello?)
I made a promise, I'm never gon' change
Rolls Royce umbrella, I'm hopin' it rain, yeah


Bitches ain't shit, doggybone, I get it
Fell in love twice, had me in my feelings
Three months, dropped damn near a half a million
Nigga, fuck a house, I damn near lost a building
Fucked nigga's hoes, so he say he wanna kill me
I miss Terri, she was different
I miss Nef, rest in peace to my nigga
Damn near wasn't there when they told me they killed you
Try and rat? Nigga, fuck on
Thirteen thou' VVS, Buffs on
Still a flooded nigga, time worth a truckload
Get to hatin', I'm out, I don't trust hoes
If the feds in the house, a nigga told on me
I pray to God my soul to keep
G5, just be as murder
Gotta get picked up, doggy I'm hurt
Still paid the lawyer even though I'm nervous


Thou shall not try one of us, if they do I'ma bust
Please don't reach for no chain
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang
Ran up my check, when I walk in the bank
They greet me at the door by my government name
I made a promise, I'm never gon' change
Rolls Royce umbrella, I'm hopin' it rain, yeah
