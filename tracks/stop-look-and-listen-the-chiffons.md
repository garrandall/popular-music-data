Stop, look and listen
Stop, look and listen
Stop, look and listen
Before you leap

(Better stop)
And think it over
(Look)
Into my eyes
(Listen)
To what I'm gonna say

(Hey, baby)
You'll never find
(A love)
As good as mine
(Love)
If desire's what you?

I know you've grown familiar
To her touch
But she's still a stranger

Don't give up the sweetness we shared
Baby
(Baby, baby)
You're heading for danger
(Danger, danger)

Whoo, baby
(Baby, baby)
You're heading for danger
(Danger, danger)

So before you leap
Before you leap

You better stop, look and listen
(Stop, look and listen)
Stop, look and listen
(Stop, look and listen, baby)
Stop, look and listen
Before you leap

You better look before you leap
The water looks shallow
But it's, it's really deep
Don't get out, out over your head

Baby
(Baby, baby)
You're heading for danger
(Danger, danger)

Whoo, baby
(Baby, baby)
You're heading for danger
(Danger, danger)

So before you leap
Before you leap

(You better stop)
And think it over
(Look)
Into my eyes
(Listen)
To what I'm gonna say

(Hey, baby)
You'll never find
(A love)
As good as mine
(Love)
If desire's what you?
