Dear heart, wish you were here
To warm this night
My dear heart, it seems like a year
Since you've been out of my sight

A single room, a table for one
It's a lonesome town all right
But soon I'll kiss you hello
At our front door

And dear heart, I want you to know
I'll leave your arms never more

But soon I'll kiss you hello
At our front door

And dear heart, I want you to know
I'll leave your arms never more
