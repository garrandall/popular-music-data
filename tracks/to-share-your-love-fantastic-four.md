It's an evil wind
That blows no good
Its a sad heart that won't love
Like I know it should (like it should)
Ohoo ohoo oh how lonesome
You must be
Oh baby, and it's a shame
A shame, shame if you don't share you love with me.
Do do do
A sad heartache when you lover is gone (Gone)
You must try to forget him
Oh you must live on (on and on and on and on)
No one blinder than He
Who can't see, oh baby, baby
And it's shame, shame if you don't share
Your love with me.
I can't help it
Oohh baby, if your lover is gone (Gone)
You must try to forget him
Oh you must live on (on and on and on and on)
I said, It's a good thing, a good thing,
A very good thing
To love someone, Oh baby, baby
But it's a shame, shame if you don't share
Your love with me.
Ahhh, oooooh baby, darling share your,
Share your, share your,
Share your love with me.
Its a shame, a shame if you don't share
Your love with me... Ooh ooh.
