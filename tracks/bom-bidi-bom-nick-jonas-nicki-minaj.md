I was wrong and you were right
If I was yours and you were mine
But it was all good (yeah)
You were gone and I was back
And I was good and you were bad
But it was all good

'Cause I'm an addict, I'm your patient
Your lips are the medication
Come here baby, yeah, you know just what I want
You got that

Bom bidi bom bom bom eh-yo
Bom bidi bom bom
You give me bad bad love
But I love it baby
Love me all night long
If you want baby, like
Bom bidi bom bom bom eh-yo
Bom bidi bom bom bom
'Cause you're a bad bad girl
But I love it baby
Love me all night long
If you want baby, yeah
(Bom bodi bom bodi bodi bom besti
Bom bodi bom bodi bodi bom besti
Bom bodi bom bodi bodi bom besti
Bom bodi bom bodi bodi bom besti)

You played it front, I played it back
You be the first, I be the last
I call it good love
Every kiss and every touch
It's like a hit it ain't enough
I call it good love

'Cause I'm an addict, I'm your patient
Your lips are the medication
Come here baby, yeah, you know just what I want
You got that

Bom bidi bom bom bom eh-yo
Bom bidi bom bom
You give me bad bad love
But I love it baby
Love me all night long
If you want baby, like
Bom bidi bom bom bom eh-yo
Bom bidi bom bom bom
'Cause you're a bad bad girl
But I love it baby
Love me all night long
If you want baby, yeah
(Bom bodi bom bodi bodi bom besti
Bom bodi bom bodi bodi bom besti
Bom bodi bom bodi bodi bom besti
Bom bodi bom bodi bodi bom besti)


Yo, b-b-b-b-bye, b-b-b-b-bye
He said, if he can't hit my bullseye, he'd rather die
He put it on me better than any other guy
He said, he need a bad bitch with an alibi
Yo, give me the muny, the yen and the pesos
Sex me on the beach in Turks and Caicos
I give him that work, that twerk, that slay hoes
Sippin' Grey Goose, and pushin' that grey ghost
Uh, assume the position when you see a bad one
The D so good, he just got N1
I'm about to blow, and I ain't talking Samsung
I'm about to show him what I do with that tongue


Bom bidi bom bom bom eh-yo
Bom bidi bom bom
You give me bad bad love
But I love it baby
Love me all night long
If you want baby, like
Bom bidi bom bom bom eh-yo
Bom bidi bom bom bom
'Cause you're a bad bad girl
But I love it baby
Love me all night long
If you want baby, yeah
(Bom bodi bom bodi bodi bom besti
Bom bodi bom bodi bodi bom besti
Bom bodi bom bodi bodi bom besti
Bom bodi bom bodi bodi bom besti)


B-b-b-b-bye, b-b-b-b-bye
He tryna bless me like his rabbi-bi
B-b-b-b-bye
