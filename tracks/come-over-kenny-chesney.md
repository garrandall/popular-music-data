I turn the TV off, to turn it on again
Staring at the blades of the fan as it spins around
Counting every crack, the clock is wide awake
Talking to myself, anything to make a sound

I told you I wouldn't call, I told you I wouldn't care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don't think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

You can say we're done the way you always do
It's easier to lie to me than to yourself
Forget about your friends, you know they're gonna say
We're bad for each other, but we ain't good for anyone else

I told you I wouldn't call, I told you I wouldn't care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don't think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

We don't have to miss each other, come over
We don't have to fix each other, come over
We don't have to say forever, come over
You don't have to stay forever, come over

I told you I wouldn't call, I told you I wouldn't care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don't think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over ohhhh

Grab your key,
Climb in your car,
Put your headlights in my yard,
Pull up the drive,
Put it in park,
Walk inside,
Underneath my stars

I'll be waiting,
I'll be waiting,
Don't say a word,
Don't say a word,
Come over.
