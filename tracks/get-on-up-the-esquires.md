Oh, oh oh, dit-dit-dit-do
Oh, oh oh, dit-dit-dit-do

Get on up
(Get on up)
Get on up
(Get on up)

Now get on up
(Get on up)
Now get on up
(Get on up)

How can you sit yourself down for a rest
When you know that I'm trying my best
To dance with you, girl
(Get on up)
To dance with you, girl
(Get on up)

So get on up
(Get on up)
On the floor
(Get on up)
Get on up, now
(Get on up)
And dance some more
(Get on up)

Get on up
(Get on up)
Let's boogaloo
(Get on up)
Get on up, now
(Get on up)
Just me and you
(Get on up)

So get on up
(Get on up)
On the floor
(Get on up)
Get on up, now
(Get on up)
And dance some more
(Get on up)

Get on up
(Get on up)
Let's boogaloo
(Get on up)
Get on up, now
(Get on up)
Just me and you
(Get on up)

Da da da da da da

Hey you
(Get on up)
Over there
(Get on up)
Get on up, now
(Get on up)
Don't go nowhere
(Get on up)

We gonna dance, dance, dance
We gonna dance, dance, dance
The boogaloo
(Get on up)
Too
(Get on up)

We're gonna do the Monkey
(The Philly Dog too)
We're gonna do the Jerk
(Just me and you)

We're gonna dance, dance, dance
We're gonna shing-a-ling
We're gonna do the thing tonight
Dit-dit-dit-do

So get on up
(Get on up)
And sock it to me
(Get on up)

Get on up
(Get on up)
And rock it to me
(Get on up)

So get on up
(Get on up)
And sock it to me
(Get on up)
