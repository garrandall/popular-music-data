You won my heart
It's just the start, babe
There's much more to love
Than the way you're thinkin' of

To wear my ring
Worth somethin' special
Now you close the door
The ring thrown on the floor

But if it's alright with you
I won't take a second chance
I don't have to take it
And you don't have to fake it anymore

Eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a lover by the toe
That's the game of love we play
It doesn't have to be that way

Eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a lover by the toe
That's the game of love we play
It doesn't have to be that way

We took a vow
Never to part, babe
Now you're tellin' me
That you have a change of heart

Now it's my turn
To feel like cryin'
Hope some day you'll see
What you meant to me

But if it's alright with you
I won't take a second chance
I don't have to take it
And you don't have to fake it anymore

Eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a lover by the toe
That's the game of love we play
It doesn't have to be that way

Eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a lover by the toe
That's the game of love we play
It doesn't have to be that way, yeah

So if it's alright with you
I won't take a second chance
I don't have to take it
You don't have to fake it anymore

Eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a lover by the toe
That's the game of love we play
It doesn't have to be that way

Eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a lover by the toe
Said that's the game of love we play
It doesn't have to be that way

Eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a lover by the toe
That's the game of love we play
It doesn't have to be that way

Say eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a lover by the toe
Said that's the game of love we play
It doesn't have to be that way

Eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a lover by the toe
That's the game of love we play

Eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a lover by the toe
