That's all I wanted
Something special, someone sacred in your eyes
For just one moment
To be bold and naked at your side
Sometimes I think that you'll never understand me
Maybe this time is forever, say it can be, whoa

That's all you wanted
Somethin' special, someone sacred in your life
Just for one moment, to be warm and naked at my side
Sometimes I think that you'll never understand me
But somethin' tells me together, we'd be happy, whoa baby

I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine
I will be your preacher teacher
Anything you have in mind
I will be your father figure
I have had enough of crime
I will be the one who loves you
'Til the end of time

That's all I wanted
But sometimes love can be mistaken for a crime
That's all I wanted
Just to see my baby's blue eyes shine
This time I think that my lover understands me
If we have faith in each other then we can be strong


If you are the desert, I'll be the sea
If you ever hunger, hunger for me
Whatever you ask for, that's what I'll be
So when you remember the ones who have lied
Who said that they cared but then
Laughed as you cried
Beautiful darling, don't think of me
Because all I ever wanted
It's in your eyes baby (baby)
And love can't lie, no
Greet me with the eyes of a child
My love is always tellin' me so
Heaven is a kiss and a smile
Just hold on, hold on
I won't let you go, my baby


I will be your father (I will be your)
I will be your (father) preacher teacher
I will be your (I'll be your daddy, oh)
I will be the one who loves you
'Til the end of time
