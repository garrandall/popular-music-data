I ain't watchin' TV today
Bad news, it can just stay away
If you ain't got anything good to say
Then shut your mouth

I got my windows down and my blinders on
Radio set to my favorite song
All green lights on the road I'm on
And there's ain't no doubt

I'm gettin' them good vibes
I'm livin' this good life
I'm breathin' on God's time
And I ain't gonna waste one breath
I'm soakin' it all up
I got me a full cup
And there ain't nothing spill it
Nothin' gonna kill it
Wavin' them worries goodbye
I'm feelin' them good vibes

I ain't tryna hear the negative (nope)
I'm just tryna change the narrative
Hell, it's simply imperative
And we all have a damn good time

I'm gettin' them good vibes
I'm livin' this good life
I'm breathin' on God's time
And I ain't gonna waste one breath
I'm soakin' it all up
I got me a full cup
And there ain't nothing spill it
Nothin' gonna kill it
Wavin' them worries goodbye
I'm feelin' them good vibes

I gotta good girl, she got a good smile
I kiss her good morning, I kiss her goodnight
We keep it on the up, that's how we get down
So don't be comin' around
Unless you got them good vibes

I'm livin' this good life
I'm breathin' on God's time
And I ain't gonna waste one breath
I'm soakin' it all up
I got me a full cup
And there ain't nothing spill it
Nothin' gonna kill it
Wavin' them worries goodbye

I'm feelin' them good vibes
I'm breathin' on God's time
And I ain't gonna waste one breath
I'm soakin' it all up
I got me a full cup
And there ain't nothing spill it
Nothin' gonna kill it
Wavin' them worries goodbye
I'm feelin' them good vibes
Oh I'm feelin' them good vibes
Yeah
