Happy birthday, happy birthday

They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips wonât let me go
(Lips wonât let me go, lips wonât let me go, oh)

They hold on tight (they hold on tight)
Yeah, they hold on tight (they hold on tight)
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips wonât let me go
(Lips wonât let me go, lips wonât let me go, oh)

Donât let this go to your head
But youâre the best Iâve ever had
Not to mention
That thing is swollen
You got me, oh, so in a trance

Something like a zip lock, but a lip lock
Want you wrapped 'round my arm like a wrist watch
Oh, so hard walking out
Got me stuck like crazy glue, ooh

They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips wonât let me go
(Lips wonât let me go, lips wonât let me go, oh)

They hold on tight (they hold on tight)
Yeah, they hold on tight (they hold on tight)
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips wonât let me go

Got me tossing, turning in the bed
Your place is where I'd rather be instead
You donât know your strength
Missing you is like adrenaline

Oh, when you got me in a grid lock
What a great spot
Yeah, that turned up kind of love and it just wonât stop
No, so hard walking out
Got me stuck like crazy glue, ooh babe

They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips wonât let me go
(Lips wonât let me go, lips wonât let me go, oh)

They hold on tight (they hold on tight)
Yeah, they hold on tight (they hold on tight)
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips wonât let me go, oh, baby

Holding back the faces I would make
Iâm a fan and youâre the rock star
Making it hard on me
Visualize a monster
âCause youâre too bad for me
Shot that arrow, Iâm hit
Need you right near me
Trying to maintain, so donât mind if I turn away (no, no)
I try to maintain, so donât mind if I turn away, ooh

They hold on tight
They hold on tight
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips wonât let me go
(Lips wonât let me go, lips wonât let me go, oh)

They hold on tight (they hold on tight)
Yeah, they hold on tight (they hold tight)
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips wonât let me go, no
