Yeah, yeah, yeah
Happy birthday


That hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight, oh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, that hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Oh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go


Don't let this go to your head
But you're the best I've ever had
Not to mention that thing is swollen
You got me oh so in a trance
Something like a ziploc, but a lip lock
Want you wrapped around my arm like a wrist watch
Oh so hard walking out
Got me stuck like krazy glue, oh


That hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight, oh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, that hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Oh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go


Got me tossing turning in the bed
Your place is where I'd rather be instead
You don't know your strength
Missing you is like adrenaline
Oh when you got me in a gridlock, what a great spot
With a turned up kind of loving, it just won't stop
No, so hard walking out
Got me stuck like krazy glue, oh-wee


That hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight, oh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, that hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Oh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go


Oh baby, holding back the faces I would make
I'm a fan and you're the rockstar, making it hard on me
Visualise a monster, cause you're too bad for me
Shot that arrow I'm hit, need you right near me
I try to maintain
So don't mind if I turn away, no no
I try to maintain
So don't mind if I turn away, oh


That hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight, oh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, that hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Oh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
