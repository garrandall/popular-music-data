Seemed like forever
I been out in the cold
Tried my best to find true love
Nothing ever took hold

Then I met you, baby
Felt your sweet caress
I opened up my heart to you, honey
And I let you do the rest

I can tell it's true love
Honey, cause, I can feel it
Pounding in my heart, ooh


I been moved (moved)
I been moved (moved)
I been moved, pretty baby
And I want you to know
I been moved (moved)
I been moved (moved)
I been m-m-m-m-m

Dance with me, baby
Let your long hair fly
Every time you move your body, girl
I, I like to wanna die

Come on now, honey
Come on now, honey
Come on and give me the loving
That I see in your eye

Can't you tell I love you, honey
Oh, can't you feel it
Pounding in my heart, ooh



Sweet thing
My heart is aching, honey
Sweet thing
It's here for the taking, honey
Sweet thing
You'll never know how much I want you

Sweet thing
You got me going, honey
Sweet thing
My love is showing, honey
Sweet thing
You'll never know how much I love you



I been moved, I been moved
I been moved, I been moved
I been moved, I been moved...

Sweet thing
You got me going, honey
Sweet thing
My love is showing, honey
Sweet thing...
