Anytime I'm alone, I can't help thinking about you
All I want, all I need, all I see, is just me and you

He giving me that good shit
That make me not quit, that good shit
He giving me that good shit
That make me not quit, that good shit


Oh, he give it to me
(Everyday, everyday, everyday, eve-ry)
He give it to me
(Everyday, everyday, everyday, eve-ry)
Oh, he give it to me
(Everyday, everyday, everyday, eve-ry)
He give it to me
(Everyday, everyday, everyday, eve-ry)


Anytime, anywhere, baby boy, I can misbehave
Breathe me in, breathe me out, feel me I'm running through your veins

He giving me that good shit
That make me not quit, that good shit
He giving me that good shit
That make me not quit, that good shit


Oh, he give it to me
(Everyday, everyday, everyday, eve-ry)
He give it to me
(Everyday, everyday, everyday, eve-ry)
Oh, he give it to me
(Everyday, everyday, everyday, eve-ry)
He give it to me
(Everyday, everyday, everyday, eve-ry)


You make me go
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
(Everyday, eve-ry)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
(Everyday, eve-ry)


I put that work on you everyday
When the night fall 'til the sun come
You done fell in love with a bad guy
I don't compromise my passion
You know what you do for me, I'm doing the same for you
I don't be tripping or making mistakes
I made too many in my past (that's right)
I fight for the things you believe in
I got your body and put it in drive, baby
Like I got keys in
We 'bout to take us a vacation
I'm 'bout to put all this vintage loving on you, baby
Like it was the late 80s
When you ride on me, baby rotate it


He giving me that good shit
That make me not quit, that good shit


Oh, he give it to me
(Everyday, everyday, everyday, eve-ry)
He give it to me
(Everyday, everyday, everyday, eve-ry)
Oh, he give it to me
(Everyday, everyday, everyday, eve-ry)
He give it to me
(Everyday, everyday, everyday, eve-ry)


You make me go
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
(Everyday, eve-ry)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
(Everyday, eve-ry)


Give it to me, to me
(She got me on it...)
Oh, he give it to me everyday
(She got me on it...)
