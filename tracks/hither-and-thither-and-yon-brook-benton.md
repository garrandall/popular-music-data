(Hither, thither, and yon)
Oh, hither and thither and yon
Around the world I've gone
Searching for true love
As so many do
Hither and thither and yon
From Cairo to far off Calay
I traveled on and on
Seeking that someone
Who's heart wouldn't stray
Hither and thither and yon
Alas, I wondered
Through many a land
Too blind was I to see
True love was always close at hand
As close as you were to me
My journey is over
It's good to be home
Your face, I gaze upon
And darling, I wonder
Oh, why did I roam
Hither and thither and yon
(Hither and yon)
Hither and thither and yon
(Thither and yon)
Hither and thither and yon
