They say you found somebody new
Whose love will always be true
I don't know what it is to be alone
That's why I dread to know you're gone

Oh, Judy, don't let our sweet love wither and die
Like flowers in the fall
Oh, Judy, don't you know
It's you I love most of all

Oh, please come back
I promise always to be true
Oh, Judy, there'll never be
Anyone else, dear, but you

Oh, please come back
I promise always to be true
Oh, Judy, there'll never be
Anyone else, dear, but you

Oh, Judy, there'll never be
Anyone else, dear, but you
Oh, Judy, there'll never be
Anyone else, dear, but you
