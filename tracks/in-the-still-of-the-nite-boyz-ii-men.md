Shoo doop shooby doo
Shoo doop shooby doo
Shoo doop shooby wah


In the still

Of the night

Held you tight
(Shoo doop shooby wah)
For I love

In the still of the night
(Ooh, in the still of the night)


I remember
(I remember)
That night in May
(I remember)
When the stars were bright
(I remember)
Up above
(I remember)
I'll hope
(I remember)
And I'll pray
(I remember)
To keep (shoo wop)
Your pre- (shoo wop) cious love


So before
(Shoo doop shooby doo)
The light
(Shoo doop shooby doo)
Hold me again
(Shoo doop shooby doo)
With all of your might
(Shoo doop shooby wah)
In the still of the night
(Ooh, in the still of the night)


Shoo wop, shoo wah
Shoo wop, shoo wah
Shoo wop, shoo wah
Shoo wop, shoo wah, oh
Shoo wop, shoo wah
Shoo wop, shoo wah
Shoo wop, shoo wah
Shoo wop, shoo wah, oh


So before
(Shoo doop shooby doo)
The light
(Shoo doop shooby doo)
Hold me again
(Shoo doop shooby doo)
With all of your might
(Shoo doop shooby wah)
In the still of the night
(Ooh in the still of the night)
In the still of the night


Shoo doop shooby doo
