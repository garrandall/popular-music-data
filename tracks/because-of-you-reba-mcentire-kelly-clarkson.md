I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself
Cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did,
You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way
To never let it get that far


Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me

Because of you
I am afraid


I loose my way
And it's not too long (before you point it out)
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness (in your eyes)
I'm forced to fake
A smile, a laugh everyday of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with


Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me

Because of you
I am afraid


I watched you die
I heard you cry every night in your sleep
(I watched you die...)
I was so young
You should have known better than to lean on me
(I was too young for you to lean on me...)
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain
(You never saw me...)
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing


Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid


Because of you...

Mmm... Oh...

Because of you...

Mmm... Oh...
