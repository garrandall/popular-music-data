Rag Doll livin' in a movie
Hot tramp Daddy's little cutie
You're so fine they'll never see ya leavin' by the back door, mam
Hot time get it while it's easy
Don't mind come on up and see me
Rag Doll baby won't you do me like you done before

I'm feelin' like a bad boy
Mm just a like a bad boy
I'm rippin' up a Rag Doll
Like throwin' away an old toy
Some babe's talkin' real loud
Talkin' all about the new crowd
Try and tell me of an old dream
A new version of the old scene
Speak easy on the grape vine
Keep shufflin' in a shoe shine
Old tin lizzy do it till you're dizzy
Give it all ya got until you're put out of your misery



Yes I'm movin'
Yes I'm movin'
Get ready for the big time
Tap dancing on a land mine
Yes I'm movin'
Yes I'm movin'
Old tin lizzy do it till you're dizzy
Give it all ya got until you're put out of your misery

Rag Doll livin' in a movie
Hot tramp Daddy's little cutie
You're so fine they'll never see ya leavin' by the back door, mam
Hot time get it while it's easy
Don't mind come on up and see me
Rag Doll, baby won't ya do me, baby won't ya do me, 
baby won't ya do me like you done before

Yes I'm movin'
Yes I'm movin'
Get ready for the big time
Get crazy on the moon shine
Yes I'm movin'
I'm really movin'
Sloe Gin Fizzy, do it till you're dizzy
Give it all ya got until you're put out of your misery
