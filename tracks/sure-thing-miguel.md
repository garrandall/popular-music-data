Love You Like a Brother
Treat you like a friend
Respect you like a lover, oh oh oh

You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that, that, that

If you'd be the cash, I'll be the rubber band
You be the match, I'mma be the fuse, boom
Painter baby you could be the muse
I'm the reporter, baby you could be the news
Cause you're the cigarette and I'm the smoker
We raise a bet, cause you're the joker
Truth told, you are the chalk and I could be the blackboard
And you can be the talk and I could be the walk

Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hands in mine
Even when we're down to the wire babe
Even when it's do or die
We can do it baby simple and plain
Cause this love is a sure thing

You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that, that, that

You could be the lover I'll be the fighter babe
If I'm the blunt, you could be the lighter babe, fire it up
Writer babe, you could be the quote
If I'm the lyric baby you could be the note, record that
Saint, I'm a sinner, prize, I'm a winner, and it's you
What can I do to deserve that
Paper baby, I'll be the pen
Say that I'm the one, cause you are ten
Real and not pretend

Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hands in mine
Even when we're down to the wire babe
Even when it's do or die
We can do it babe simple and plain
Cause this love is a sure thing

Rock with me babe
Let me hold you in my arms, talk with me babe, yeah
Rock with me babe
Let me hold you in my arms, talk with me babe
I fall in love every single time I look into your eyes
Those eyes; they never lie
I can tell your mine it's so hard when you're not around
I get mad thinking how I can't always have you around

I wanna make you spend the whole day with me boy
Play me like your toy, I'm all yours to enjoy
Hoping this moment last long and forever
I got no fear what so ever, you're my one and only lover
Roll a dice I bet it twice
Don't you think I can live a life without
You in it you can bet that
Never sweat that you know what I'm best at
Ready or not, I'm gonna have you by tonight
I call the shot won't you be my kryptonite

Love you like a brother
Treat you like a friend
Respect you like a lover
