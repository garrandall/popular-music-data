I'm gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local D.J.
It's a rocking little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
Gotta hear it again today

You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox's blowing a fuse
My heart beating rhythm
And my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven and
Tell Tchaikovsky the news

I got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I think I got it off the writer
Sitting down by the rhythm review
Roll over Beethoven
We're rocking in two by two

Well, if you feel it and like it
Well, get your lover
And reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just jump around and reel and rock it
Roll it over, roll over Beethoven
We're rocking in two by two, oh

Well, early in the morning
I'm a givin you the warning
Don't you step on my
Blue suede shoes

Hey diddle diddle
Gonna play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven and
Tell Tchaikovsky the news

You know she winks
Like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see em reel and rock
Long as she's got a dime
The music will never stop

Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Dig to these rhythm and blues
