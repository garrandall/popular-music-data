Making love at the same time that you touch yourself (you get)
Baby, nothing will happen, go crazy (cra-crazy, crazy)
Your boyfriend treats you bad, he doesn’t control you (no, no, no, no)
He said-


My lil' devi (lil' devil)
She gets pornographic in intimacy (baby)
Her husband doesn’t value her and leaves her alone (leaves her alone)
And I'm always waiting for him with my gun (gun)
And with me now she always gets wet


Baby girl (uah)
Your boyfriend loves you but you are unfaithful (yeh-eh)
Because you're a devil inside of a woman (oh-oh, oh-oh)
And when the sun hides you want to drink, Daughter of Lucifer

Baby girl (my baby; uah, uah )
Your boyfriend loves you but you are unfaithful (why-why-why)
Because you're a devil inside of a woman (woma-a-an)
And when the sun hides you want to drink, Daughter of Lucifer


Baby, with ra-ta-ta-ta-ta
Baby, I am your criminal
Baby, with ra-ta-ta-ta-ta
Baby, your boyfriend will for forget it
Baby, with ra-ta-ta-ta-ta
Baby, with me you will move
Baby, with ram-bam-bam-bam-bam
Baby, with a shot he will die (get out!)
Why, why, whu (why)
Why are you going to be faithful (why)
Why, why, why
Baby, forget about him (him)
You're my lil' devil and I'm your demon
A love of the asylum
And if I see you with him I hate you
She always has me in insomnia


Medusa, Versace (Versace)
We always do 69 like Tekashi (yeh-eh)
I'll break to you the whole secret, Illuminati (-nati)
She hops out with me at the disco in the Ferrari (-rrari)
Smoking Mari' (uah)
And you made your body work upside down, baby, in R.D
And we fuck and we always cum at the same time
And I made you the love and got wrapped up in your skin
And my dick on your pussy I tatted you
Oh-oh-oh (uah)
Baby, you're mine, forget that ma-a-n
And bounce that ass dancing for me reggaeton to me-e-e


Baby girl (uah)
Your boyfriend loves you but you are unfaithful (yeh-eh)
Because you're a devil inside of a woman (oh-oh, oh-oh)
And when the sun hides you want to drink, Daughter of Lucifer (oh-oh, oh-oh; uah)

Baby girl (my baby)
Your boyfriend loves you but you are unfaithful (why?)
Because you're a devil inside of a woman (-dy)
And when the sun hides you want to drink, Daughter of Lucifer (drink; -ghter)


My lil' devil (my girl)
She gets pornographic, she's not timid (look at me, baby)
And her man doesn't value her and leaves her alone (leaves her alone, alone)
And I’m always waiting for him with my gun (ra-pa-pa-pa)
And she always falls in love, my lil' devil
