Here they come yo, here they come
Here they come yo, here they come
This or that?
This or that?
This or that?
This or that?
This or that?
This or that?
This or that?
This or that?


Who's the black sheep, what's the black sheep?
Know not who I am, or when I'm coming, so you sleep
Wasn't in my realm, or wasn't in your sphere
Knew not who I was, but listen here
Dres, D-R-E-S, yes I guess I can start
If it's all right with you, I'll rip this here joint apart
Back, middle, to the front, don't front
Wanna a good time, gonna give you what you want
Can I hear a hey? (hey)
Can I get a yo? (yo)
You got a 'hat? (huh)
It's for the hoes (oh)
The styling is creative, black sheep of the native
Can't be violated, or even decepticated
I got brothers in the Jungle, cousins on the quest
Dead departed uncles, in pea porridge, may they rest
Guess, which way, what, when, how
Mista Lawnge, Dres, Black Sheep slam... Now
Know you've heard the others, phonies to the lovers
Then of course, the choice is yours


You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is kinda phat


Where's the black sheep, here's the black sheep
Even if we wanted to, the flock could not be weak
Watch me swing like this, why should I swing it like that
Because in fact, on me it might not attract
Therefore I ignore, do as I feel inside
I live with me, I've got my back tonight
Ya know what I'm saying
Yo Black, I'm not playing
Need to go with this, or go with this with no delay and
See, in actuality, wonder can it be
I made it look easy, because it is to me
Any time capacity was filled, tried to rock it
Any time a honey gave us play, tried to knock it
Never was a fool, so we finished school
Never see us sweat, and you'll never see us drool
Out to rock the globe while it's still here to rock
Don't punch girls, and we don't punch a clock
Gotta go, gotta go, see you later by the cat
And you can't beat that with a bat


You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is kinda phat


Engine, engine, number nine
On the New York transit line
If my train goes off the track
Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up!


Back on the scene, crispy n' clean
You can try, but then why, cause you can't intervene
We be the outcast, down for the settle
Won't play the rock, won't play the pebble
Open the door, you best believe, we're sliding through it ... sssswiftly
Niftily, we can make it hip to be what we are
Cause what we be, be the epitome, doo, dah, dipitty
So now I dwell just to say you're plainer
Hold your cup, cause I got the container
Pass a plate or, cross the fader
Black Sheep get play like the Sony Innovator
Never the traitor, party inflater
And you can get a scoop ... later


You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is kinda phat
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at
(Where it's at, where it's at, where it's at, where it's at)
(Eee come on, eeh come on, eeh come on, eeh come on)
