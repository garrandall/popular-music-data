Hey, hey, hey!
La, la, la, la, la
Hey, hey, hey!
La, la, la, la, la


You come from here, I come from there
You rock out in your room, I rock a world premiere
We're more alike than anybody could ever tell
Friday we're cool, Monday we're freaks
Sometimes we rule, sometimes we can't even speak
But we kick it, let loose, and LOL (LOL)


It may seem cliche for me to wanna say that you're not alone (that you're not alone)
And you can call me uncool, but it's a simple fact
I got your back
Yeah, yeah, yeah


'Cause we're one and the same
We're anything but ordinary
One and the same
I think we're almost legendary
You and me, the perfect team
Chasing down the dream
We're one and the same
Hey, hey, hey!
La, la, la, la, la


I'm kinda like you, you're kinda like me
We write the same song in a different key
It's got a rhythm, you and me can get along


And it may seem cliche for me to wanna say that you're not alone (Here I go again)
And you can call me uncool, but it's a simple fact
I still got your back (I still got your back)


'Cause we're one and the same
We're anything but ordinary
One and the same
I think we're almost legendary
You and me, the perfect team
Shaking up the scene
We're one in the same


'Cause we're one and the same
We're anything but ordinary
One and the same
We're something more than momentary


'Cause we're one
'Cause we're one (we're almost legendary)
We're anything but ordinary


You and me, the perfect team
Chasing down the dream, oh
You and me, the perfect team
Shaking up the scene
We're one and the same


Hey, hey, hey!
La, la, la, la, la
Hey, hey, hey!
