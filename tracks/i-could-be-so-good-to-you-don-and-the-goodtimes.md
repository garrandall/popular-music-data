I only want to tell you
That I think you look real nice
My face is so much brighter
When I see you once or twice
I could learn
All the ways of loving you
If you gave me a chance to
Run into Spring with you
Get in the ring with you
Do anything we can do, oh, baby

(CHORUS)
I could be so good to you
Baby, baby
I could be so good to you
I watched you standing all alone
And then I saw you smile
I knew I had to take a chance
And talk to you awhile
So I can't waste any time
I gotta move fast now
Telling you just how
I can be good to you
Do what I should for you
I could do so many things, oh, baby

(CHORUS)
I want you, I need you
I got to please you

(CHORUS) 4X
