The look in your eyes, baby, just turns me on;
So inviting to me... You know I feel that they're my home...

(Darling, reach out just for me...)
And darlin', I had to surrender all my sense of pride;
Your touch from behind on the shoulder's so tender...
(The deepness of your eyes...)

I can't stop loving you, baby...
(The deepness of your eyes...)
I feel your loving all the time, oh! Oh, yeah...
(The deepness of your eyes...)

The wheel of fading fortune's standing,
For a long, long, long day, yeah, yeah, hey...

People say that the eyes tell stories, and they mirror the soul;
Tell me, do we reflect the sameness of one, the unity to have and to hold?

(Darling, reach out just for me...)
I tend our love in quiet seclusion - only you can say
If this is love or just an illusion...
(The deepness of your eyes...)

I can't stop loving you, baby...
(The deepness of your eyes...)
I feel the loving all the time, hey...
(The deepness of your eyes...)

The wheel of fading fortune's standing
For a long, long, windin' day, yeah...

I can't stop lovin' you, baby... baby...
(The deepness of your eyes...)
I feel your lovin' all the time, hey!
(The deepness of your eyes...)
I can't stop lovin' you baby... oh, baby...
(The deepness of your eyes...)
Feel your lovin' all the time... la-la-la
(The deepness of your eyes...)
I can't stop lovin' you baby... oh, baby!
(The deepness of your eyes...)
I feel the lovin' all the time... yes, I do...
(The deepness of your eyes...)
I can't stop lovin' you baby! Hey, hey!
(The deepness of your eyes...)
I feel your lovin' all...
(The deepness of your eyes...)
I can't stop lovin'-ah... whoo, baby... whoo, baby...
(The deepness of your eyes...)
Hee, hee, hee, hee, feel your lovin' all the time, baby..
(The deepness of your eyes...)
I can't stop lovin' you baby... lovin' you baby... lovin' you baby...
(The deepness of your eyes...)
Lovin' all...
