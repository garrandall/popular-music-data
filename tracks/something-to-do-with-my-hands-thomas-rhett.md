Well I smoke and I fish
But not near enough to satisfy an itch
Of a girl, understand
I need something to do with my hands

I don't work, on a car
And I'm as bad at pool as I am at throwin' darts
And golf, not a fan
But I need something to do with my hands

So maybe I could stick 'em in your pockets
Run 'em through your hair
And we can get to rockin'
There you are and baby, here I am
And I need something to do with my hands

I can play you a song
On this old guitar, if it turns you on
If you want, we could dance
But I need something to do with my hands

So maybe I could stick 'em in your pockets
Run 'em through your hair
And we can get to rockin'
There you are and baby, here I am
And I need something to do with my hands

Top off, in my jeep
And we can go for a ride and I could drive with my knees
I'll behave, best I can
But I need something to do with my hands

So maybe I could stick 'em in your pockets
Run 'em through your hair
And we can get to rockin'
There you are and baby, here I am

Yeah maybe I could stick 'em in your pockets
Run 'em through your hair
And we can get to rockin'
There you are and baby, here I am
And I need something to do with my hands
I need something to do with my hands
With my hands
Something to do with my hands
