All I wanna do is stay right here on the floor
Get lost in the night 'n' dance like there's no tomorrow
Don't care about the sunrise
Somebody please just hit the lights
All I wanna do is dance like there's no tomorrow

Today just wasn't my day
Everyone's getting me so fed up
I gotta find a way
I know what can make me feel better
Stepping out in my best
Looking hotter than ever
Wherever the party is
That's where I'll be in a second

I'm ready to move my body
Forget about all my problems
When I hear my song
I'm a lose control
(Hee hee)
I go

I'm loving the atmosphere
Feels like I'm floating in heaven
The music's all in my ear
Taking over me
My hearts racing
Feeling so Hollywood
How I got everybody staring
There eyes on the cameras
And I'm loving all the attention

Get up to move my body
Forget about all my problems
When I hear my song
I'm a lose control
(Hee hee)
I go

Please DJ don't say it's the last call
'Cause I know what it means
And I don't want you to play no slow song
I'm still building it up to talk to that guy
Just give me another song and make it right

I just wanna stay right here on the floor
Get lost in the night and dance like there's no tomorrow
Don't care about the sunrise
Somebody please just hit the lights
All I wanna do is dance like there's no tomorrow
