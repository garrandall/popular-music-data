K. Swisha on the track
Skrrt-skrrt
Hey, hey, hey
Skrrt-skrrt
I know anywhere
Hey, hey


Nawfside cooling, shorty, yeah that's where I stay
Heard you was a lame, boy
Get up out my face
And my ex keep calling, swear that she be in the way
And I need a thick redbone shorty where I lay
Bad bih in L.A., tell me that she'll make the trip
Shorty bad as hell, yeah, with them Kylie Jenner lips
Uber every-fucking-where, pre-rolls in my VIP
Canada jawn, yeah I think that bitch from the 6


Shorty wanna kiss me, but I know she sucking dick
Shorty wanna kiss me, but I know she sucking dick
Look, Uber everywhere, pre-rolls in the VIP
Yeah, Uber everywhere, pre-rolls in my VIP
Ayy (Skrrt-skrrt)


Yeah, I wanna get the 'Rari, but I know it takes some time (Skrrt-skrrt)
Pre-roll shorty light it up, you know you fine
Lil 5 with my 5 and I'm rolling up the gas
And I need my leg room, Bapestas, first class
East Atlanta jawn Cookout on Moreland Ave (Skrrt-skrrt)
She say she 'bout that action but I think that I'ma pass


Shorty wanna fuck me but I know I got some top
Shorty wanna fuck me but I just got some top (Skrrt-skrrt)
I can't fuck with ops never stop pull up in that juice box
Uber fucking everywhere
I can't fuck with ops never stop pull up in that juice box
Uber fucking everywhere
Uber everywhere, pre-rolls in my VIP (Skrrt-skrrt)
Uber everywhere, pre-rolls in my VIP
And I think that bitch from Canada
I think she from the 6
Uber everywhere, pre-rolls in the VIP
Hey hey hey (Skrrt-skrrt)
Hey hey hey (Skrrt-skrrt)
Hey hey hey (Skrrt-skrrt)
Hey hey hey (Skrrt-skrrt)
