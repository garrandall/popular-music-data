You think I should do this and drop this shit like tomorrow?
Yea, yea, yeaaa, yee, alright!
Alright!


Okay, it's late yeah

I've been moving at a race, Straight up!
Tell me what we going through is a phase


Shit I can't escape

Niggas wanna hate, yea they do that by the day, Yeah, yeah!
On these skates, I've been moving state to state
Fuck that lobster and that steak
I got mo shit on my plate
Rolling in my Uber, that's just how I use my time
Blowing on that Backwood, that's just how I use my mind
Looking out the window, hoping it all would be fine
Pay no mind, they don't pay no mind, yeah yeah yeah
Magic City they shaking that ass, yeah yeah yeah
Diamonds of Atlanta they be bad, yeah yeah yeah
When we hit V Live I got that bag, Straight up!
Pick your DJ and we got that bitch on smash, yeah yeah yeah

After call me when you done counting them bands, yeah yeah yeah, Yeah!


Please don't let it get late, Yeah, yeah!
I'm a Uber to your crib I can not wait, It's lit!
I've been moving at my pace
Tell me what we going through is just a phase, yeah yeah yeah, Straight up!


North side cooling shawty yea that is where I stay
Heard you was a lame boy get up out my face
And my ex keep calling swear that she be in the way
And I need a thick red bone shawty where I lay
