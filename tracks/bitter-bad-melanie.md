It's bitter bad, heartsick sad
When the one that you love has lost the feel for you
If you do me wrong
I'll put your first and last name in my rock 'n' roll song

It's bitter bad, he's got the nerve to get mad
When it's he who lost the feel for you

Oh what a life, what a mean low down world
You've been doing my stuff with another girl
You've been doing my stuff with another girl

It's bitter bad, he's got the nerve to get mad
When it's he who lost the feel for you

Oh what a life, what a mean low down world
You've been doing my stuff with another girl
You've been doing my stuff with another girl

If you do me wrong
I'll put your first and last name in my rock 'n' roll song

It's bitter bad, heartsick sad
When the one that you love has lost the feel for you
When the one that you love has lost the feel for you
When the one that you love don't love you anymore
When the one that you love has lost the feel for you
