Hoverin' by my suitcase
Tryin' to find a warm place
To spend the night, heavy rain fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin'
That it's alright

Rainy night in Georgia
Such a rainy night in Georgia
I feel it's rainin' all over the world
Rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a-flashin'
Taxi cabs and buses passin'
Through the night
A distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

Rainy night in Georgia
Oh, it's a rainy night in Georgia
It seems it's rainin' all over the world
Rainin' all over the world

How many times I wondered
But it still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it or you think of it
Oh, you just got to do your own thing

I find me a place in a box car
So I take out my guitar
To pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
Then I'm alright

A rainy night in Georgia
Such a rainy night in Georgia
I feel it's rainin' all over the world
Rainin' all over the world
Rainin' all over the world
