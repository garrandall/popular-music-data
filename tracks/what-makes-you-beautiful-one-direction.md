You're insecure, don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need makeup to cover up
Being the way that you are is enough


Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you


Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh, oh, you don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, you don't know you're beautiful
That's what makes you beautiful


So c-come on, you got it wrong
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song
I don't know why you're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eyes


Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you


Baby, you light up my world like nobody else (Nobody else)
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh, oh, you don't know you're beautiful (Oh)
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, you don't know you're beautiful
That's what makes you beautiful


Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na


Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful


Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground (ground), it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful (Beautiful)
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately (Desperately)
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful
Oh-oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh
That's what makes you beautiful
