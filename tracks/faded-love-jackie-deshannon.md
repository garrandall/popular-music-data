As I look at the letter
You wrote to me
It's you, oh, it's you
I'm thinking of

As I read the lines
That to me, oh, so dear
I remember our faded love

I miss you, darling
More and more every day
As Heaven would miss
The stars above

And with every heartbeat
Lord, I still think of you
And remember our faded love

As I think of the past
And all the pleasures we had
As I watched the
Mating of the dove

For it was in
It was in the springtime
That you said goodbye
But I still remember
I remember our faded love
(I remember our faded love)
