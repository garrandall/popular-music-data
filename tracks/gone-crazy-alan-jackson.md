here I am alone again tonight
in this old empty house
its hard to learn what you don't think you need
that you can't live without
never leave the sound of the telephone
but ever since you left
i've been gone

gone crazy
going out of my mind
i've asked myself the reasons
atleast a thousand times
going up and down this hall way
trying to leave the pain behind
ever since you left
i've been gone

never saw your face this many times
when you were really here
things you said I never understood
now crystal clear
never spent this much time alone
but ever since you left
i've been gone

gone crazy
going out of my mind
i've asked myself the reasons
atleast a thousand times
going up and down this hall way
trying to leave the pain behind
ever since you left
i've been gone

i've been gone
