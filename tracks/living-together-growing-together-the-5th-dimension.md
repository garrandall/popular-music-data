Start with a man and you have one
Add on a woman and then you have two
Add on a child and what have you got?
You've got more than three
You've got what they call a family

Living together
Growing together
Just being together
That's how it starts
Three loving hearts all
Pulling together
Working together
Just building together
That makes you strong

If things go wrong
We'll still get along somehow
Living and growing together

It just takes wood to build a house
Fill it with people and you have a home
Fill it with love and people take root
It's just like a tree
Where each branch becomes a family that's

Living together
Growing together
Just being together
That's how it starts
Three loving hearts all
Pulling together
Working together
Just building together
That makes you strong

If things go wrong
We'll still get along somehow
Living and growing together
Still get along somehow
Living and growing together

Living together
Growing together
Just being together
That's how it starts
Three loving hearts all
Pulling together
Working together
Just building together
That makes you strong

If things go wrong
We'll still get along somehow
Living and growing
Just like we're doing now, together
