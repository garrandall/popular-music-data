Falling for you 
And I just can't help myself
Baby I'm falling
Falling for you 
And I just can't help myself
Baby I'm falling

Thirty days since our first kiss
Sit alone reminisce
What you said last night just took me by surprise
How you said you're not gonna cry no more
You're waiting to exhale
Having feelings that you're falling
Woman I've already fell



Contemplating what to do
Falling faster over you
But my heart and pride are out there on the line
I dial your number on the phone
A steady ringing your not home
If you're listening to this message
Girl I'm calling cuz I'm falling for you

Falling for you
And I just can't help myself
Baby I'm falling
(Can't believe I'm falling)
Falling for you 
(Do you feel the same way too)
And I just can't help myself
Baby I'm falling

Falling for you 
And I just can't help myself 
Baby I'm falling for you
Falling for you 
And I just can't help myself 
Baby I'm falling for you 

Falling for you
(yes I am, yes I am)
And I just can't help myself
(can't help myself)
Baby I'm falling
(Oh I, oh I)
Falling for you 
And I just can't help myself
(Falling baby)
Baby I'm falling
(Falling baby)

I can't help myself
Seems I keep on falling
No, no I just can't help myself
Seems I keep on falling
No just can't help myself
Seems like I keep on falling
Yeah, help me
Won't you help me sugar


(I'm falling)
