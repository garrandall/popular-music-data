I've been all over this country
Been half way 'round the world
I've been traveling so dog gone much
That I haven't got a steady girl

Somebody to love (Somebody to love)
Somebody to love (Somebody to love)
Somebody to call me turtledove
Somebody to love

Yes I guess I've been lucky
I've had me fortune and fame
But I would give up my roman ways
Just to change some girlie's name

Somebody to love (Somebody to love)
Somebody to love (Somebody to love)
Somebody to call me turtledove
Somebody to love

I've been hurtin' (He's been hurtin')
Such a long, long time (Long, long time)
I've been searchin' (He's been searchin')
Where's that girl of mine

Won't you hear me now,
If there's somebody listenin'
Won't you hear my plea?
Won't you send me a good, good girl
To spend her life with me

Somebody to love (Somebody to love)
Somebody to love (Somebody to love)
Somebody to call me turtledove
Somebody to love
I've been hurtin' (He's been hurtin')
Such a long, long time (Long, long time)
I've been searchin' (He's been searchin')
Where's that girl of mine

Won't you hear me now,
If there's somebody listenin'
Won't you hear my plea?
Won't you send me a good, good girl
To spend her life with me

Somebody to love (Somebody to love)
Somebody to love (Somebody to love)
Somebody to call me turtledove
Somebody to love

Somebody to love (Somebody to love)
Somebody to love (Somebody to love)
Somebody to call me turtledove
Somebody to love...
