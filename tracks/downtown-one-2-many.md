Now and then they tell the centre of my dreams
Listening to the feelings of your soul
Just forget about the hard times left behind
And think of where you really want to go

Let me show you where to what to be
Let me show you where can be free
Let me take you to the place I know
Let me take you when we come, lets go

Come downtown
In the city there's a lot of fun
Down downtown
Wooa wooa wooa woo
Come downtown
Let's go ahead, don't turn around
Down downtown
Wooa wooa wooa woo

Think of all the times when you were down and out
Had no money and no place to go
Think of all the times when you were on your own
No one seemed to care - no friends, no love

Let me show you where what to be
Let me show you where you can be free
Let me take you to the place I know
Let me take you when we come, lets go

Come downtown
In the city there's a lot of fun
Down downtown
Wooa wooa wooa woo
Come downtown
Let's go ahead, don't turn around
Down downtown
Wooa wooa wooa woo

I will take all of the shadows right away
Enter Soho with a brighter day
This is no time in a village for a while
We can live a life of happiness and style

Aha
Down downtown
Wooa wooa wooa woo
Come downtown

Down downtown
Wooa wooa wooa woo
Come downtown...
