OH!
When you touch me
When you touch me
Good God
When you touch me
Looka here
I can't stand it
Can't stand it, UH
I can't stand your love
I can't stand your love, UH

You don't love nobody else
Get back, uh, I can't stand myself
Can't stand your love
Good God
Early in the morning
Can't get it right
Had a little time
With my baby last night
Early in the morning
Gotta do the walk
Let me, baby, just let me talk

When you touch me, good God
When you touch me, all right
Come on, baby, hold my hand
Just want you to know
I'm a soul man

Can't stand it, UH
Can't stand it, oh, good God
Can't stand it, looka here
Can't stand it, baby, OW!
Can't stand it
Can't stand your love
Can't stand it
I can't stand your love

Looka here, baby
What you want me to do?
Baby, what you want me to do?
You made me, made me love you
You give me fever and my body's wet
You give me fever, break out in a cold sweat
Baby, good God
Baby, looka here
Sometimes, I work
Sometime I call
Sometimes I ring so hard

OH, come on, good God
Baby, looka here
Can't stand your love
Can't stand your love
Can't try your love
Can't stand your love
I can't stand it
I can't stand it, good God
Can't stand it, all right
I can't stand it, all right

Bass, looka here
Bass, Tim
Help me out, Tim
Show me how you work a little bit, Tim

Good God, uh, good God
All right, OW, can't stand it

Wait a minute, Tim
Let me get this little thing together over here

Can't stand it
