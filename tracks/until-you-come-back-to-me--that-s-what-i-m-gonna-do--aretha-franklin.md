Though you don't call anymore 
I sit and wait in vain 
I guess I'll rap on your door 
Tap on your window pane 
I want to tell you baby 
The changes I've been going through 
Missing you, listen you 

'till you come back to me 
That's what I'm gonna do 

Why did you have to decide 
You had to set me free 
I'm gonna swallow my pride 
I'm gonna beg you to (please baby please) see me 
I'm gonna walk by myself 
Just to prove that my love is true 
Oh, for you baby 

'till you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do 

Living for you my dear 
Is like living in a world of constant fear 
In my plea, I've got to make you see 
That our love is dying 

Although your phone you ignore 
Somehow I must explain 
I'm gonna rap on your door 
Tap on your window pane 
I'm gonna camp on your step 
Until I get through to you 
I've got to change your view baby 

'till you come back to me 
That's what I'm gonna do
