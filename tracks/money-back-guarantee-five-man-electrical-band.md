Well, I sat down in front of my TV set
And some man said this is what you get
Only a dollar a week and a dollar down
You can drive this car anywhere in this town

You can take it on the highway, check the tires
Leave it in the driveway and check out the wires
If that ain't just what your heart desires
I tell you what I'm going to do

Take it on a ten day trial
And if you don't like what you see
Just bring it on back in a while
Get your money back guarantee

I took me for a walk and I heard some racket
Here was some dude, he was fiddling a gadget
He said my new invention will do your chores
Take out your garbage and wax your floors

Just plug it in the wall it's completely automatic
Hang it in the hall or you could hide it in the attic
I don't want know friction, I don't need no static

So here's what I'm gonna do, whoo

Take it on a ten day trial
And if you don't like what you see
You can bring it on back in a while
Here's your money back guarantee

It's hard to believe this is my love song
I only hope I didn't take too long
But this here's the point I've been working up to
True fine mama, I do love you

And if you open up your heart I think you'll find
I'll treat you good and I'll treat you kind
If loving me ain't what you had in mind
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do

Take it on a ten day trial
And if you don't like what you see
Just bring it on back in a while

And if you don't like what you see
Well you can bring it on back in a while
And get your money back guarantee
