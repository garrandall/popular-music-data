I'd like to turn the whole world on, just for a moment...

I'm pretty - I'm a pretty pretty baby doll, and
I wanna - I wanna be a superstar
All right - get to the factory
O.K. - hang out with ANDY
All right - got my mascara
I'm hot - I wanna dare you to watch...

I'd like to turn the whole world on, just for a moment...
Got my money on. got my favourite song
Got my favourite drink, gonna make you think
Gonna look around...

Everything is beautiful, all right
Everyone is beautiful, tonight
All of us are superstars, yeah we've come so far
We are beautiful, all right, all right, all right...

Just for a moment - I want everybody's eyes on me
I wanna see it. I wanna show what I can be
Oh studio fifty four, I'm a disco whore
Gotta get my place in the world, I'm alive -
I'm so alive, I'm a pretty pretty baby doll

Everything is beautiful, all right
Everyone is beautiful, tonight
All of us are superstars, yeah we've come so far
We are beautiful, all right, all right, all right...

Oh studio fifty four, I'm a disco whore
Gotta get my place in the world, I'm alive -
I'm so alive, I'm a pretty pretty baby doll

Everything is beautiful, all right
Everyone is beautiful, tonight
All of us are superstars, yeah we've come so far

We are beautiful, all right, all right, all right...
