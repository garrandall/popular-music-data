Ain't no love, ain't no love, like my baby's love
It's like burnin' fire, set off in my bones
Ain't no lonely days, ain't no lonely lonely lonely nights
Every little thing that she does
I know the girl's alright

'Cause I ain't never, never, found me a girl
Love me like you do, to love me like you do

Ain't no man, ain't no man, go a little woman like me
You got all the lovin' honey, what a sweet girl can claim
You're every poor boys dream, and every rich mans friend
But I don't need money, honey
'Cause you're always there

'Cause I ain't never, never, found me a girl
Love me like you do, to love me like you do

No I ain't never, never, found me a girl
Love me like you do, to love me like you do
To love me like you do

No I ain't never, never, found me a girl
Like you do
