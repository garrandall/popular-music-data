Hey homecoming queen
Why do you lie
When somebody's mean
Where do you hide

Do people assume
You're always alright
Been so good at smiling
Most of your life

Look damn good in the dress
Zipping up the mess
Dancing with your best foot forward
Does it get hard
To have to play the part
Nobody's feeling sorry for ya

But what if I told you the world wouldn't end
If you started showing what's under your skin
What if you let em all in on the lie
Even the homecoming queen cries

Hey homecoming queen
How's things at home
Still walking on eggshells
When that curtains closed

Did your daddy teach you
How to act tough
Or more like your momma
Sweep it under the rug

Look damn good in the dress
Zipping up the mess
Dancing with your best foot forward
Did you want the crown
Or does it weigh you down
Nobody's feeling sorry for ya

What if I told you the world wouldn't end
If you started showing what's under your skin
What if you let em all in on the lie
Even the homecoming queen cries

Yeah what if I told you the sky wouldn't fall
If you lost your composure, said to hell with it all
Not everything pretty sparkles and shines
And even the homecoming queen cries

Oh yeah
Even the homecoming queen cries

Hey homecoming queen
Why do you lie
When somebody's mean
Where do you hide
