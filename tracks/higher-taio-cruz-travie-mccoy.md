Yeah, it's Travie, heh
Taio
Haha
Let's go (Let's go)


Now I've never been one to dance
But we've got something going on in my pants (Haha)
It's like I'm stuck in a trance and I'd better take advantage
Who knows when I'll get another chance
I feel like breaking too
Electric Boogaloo
You play Kelly, I'll be O-Zone
Travie Laz and Taio Cruz


Now I know how to get down on the floor (Floor)
Experienced in moves you can't ignore, ('Nore)
But something 'bout this beat that's got me hooked (Hooked)
Come over here and take a closer look (Look)


'Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't stay on the ground
Whoa, I can't get enough, I can't get enough
This is taking me now (Ha, ha, let's go)


It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground


I do this just for kicks, just for the thrill (Thrill)
I got this high without takin' a pill (Pill)
This groove has got me way over the sun (Sun)
I'm dancin' like I am the only one (One)


'Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't stay on the ground
Whoa, I can't get enough, I can't get enough
This is taking me now


It's taking me higher, higher (Yeah)
Higher off the ground (Let's go)
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground


I got my feet in the air and my head on the ground
And the rest of my body is somewhere in the clouds
I'm coming down no time soon
Like I'm tied to a couple hundred helium balloons
Looks like I'ma be up for a minute (Uh-huh)
Such a beautiful feeling, 'idn't it?
Yup, when your body is so plateau
On a level that just feels so infinite


The music's got me going higher
I feel like I can touch the sky


It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground


It's your boy Travie McCoy
Taio Cruz
