Yeah, itâs Travie. Aha
Taio. Haha.
Letâs go.
Now Iâve never been one to dance,
But weâve got something going on in my pants
Itâs like Iâm stuck in a trance and Iâd better take advantage
Who knows when Iâll get another chance
I feel like Breakinâ 2
Electric Boogaloo
You play Kelly, Iâll be O-zone
Travie Laz and Taio Cruz


Now I know Iâm gunâ get down on the floor
Experiencing what you can't ignore
But something bout this beat just got me hooked
Come over here and take a closer look


Coz I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't stay on the ground (woah)
I can't get enough, I can't get enough
This is taking me now


(Letâs go!)
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground



I do this for,
Its just for the thrill,
I got this high, were bout to get a feel
This move has got me way over the sun
I'm dancing like I am the only one


Coz I can't get enough, I cant get enough
I can't stay on the ground (woah)
I can't get enough, I can't get enough
This is taking me now


(Letâs go!)
Its taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground



I got my feet in the air, and my head on the ground
And the rest of bodyâs somewhere in the clouds
Iâm coming down, no time soon
Like Iâm tied to a couple hundred helium balloons
Looks like imma be up for a minute
Uh huh, such a beautiful feeling, didnât it?
Yup, where your body is so plateau
On a level that just feels so infinite


The musics got me going higher
I feel like I can touch the sky


It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground



Itâs your boy Travie McCoy!
Taio Cruz!
