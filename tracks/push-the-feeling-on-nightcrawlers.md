Push the feeling
Push the feeling

There will come a time
When the love of a man is first in line
Soon the tide will turn
And this world will be a place to learn
But it's up to you
To push through
Don't you wanna help me now?

Push the feeling
Oh, push the feeling on
Push the feeling
Oh, push the feeling on
Push the feeling
Oh, push the feeling on
Push the feeling
Ooo-ooo-on

Push it, let's push it
Push the feeling on
Push it, let's push it
Gotta keep moving on

Those who suffer pain
Will begin to live their lives again
Those who cried in vain
They will never have to hide in shame
But it's up to you
To pull us through
Don't you wanna help me now?

Push the feeling
Oh, push the feeling on
Push the feeling
Oh, push the feeling on
Push the feeling
Oh, push the feeling on
Push the feeling
Ooo-ooo-on

Push it, let's push it
Gotta keep moving on
Push it, let's push it
Push the feeling on
Push it, let's push it
Gotta keep moving on

Push the feeling
Ooooh
Ya gotta push through
Don't you wanna help me now?

Push the feeling
Oh, push the feeling on
Push the feeling
Oh, push the feeling on
Push the feeling
Oh, push the feeling on
Push the feeling
Ooo-ooo-on

Push it, let's push it
Push the feeling on
Push it, let's push it
Gotta keep moving on

Push it, let's push it
Push the feeling on
Push it, let's push it
Gotta keep moving on

Push it, let's push it
Push the feeling on
Push it, let's push it
Gotta keep moving on

Push it, let's push it
Push the feeling on
Push it, let's push it
Gotta keep moving on
