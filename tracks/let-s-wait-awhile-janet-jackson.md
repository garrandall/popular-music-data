There's something I want to tell you
There's something I think that you should know
It's not that I shouldn't really love you
Let's take it slow
When we get to know each other
And we're both feeling much stronger
Then let's try to talk it over
Let's wait awhile longer

Let's wait awhile
Before it's too late
Let's wait awhile
Before we go too far

Remember that special night
When all of the stars were shining bright
We made our first endeavor to stay together
We made our very first promise
To love, to share, and be real honest
But on that very first night
It wasn't quite right

Let's wait awhile
Before it's too late
Let's wait awhile
Our love will be great
Let's wait awhile
Before we go too far

I didn't really know not to let all my feelings show
To save some for later so our love can be greater
You said you would always love me
Remember I said the same thing to you
You don't have to be frightened with my love
Because, I'll never give up on you
Let's wait awhile
Ah well before it's too late
You know you can't rush love, love

Let's wait awhile
(Ohhoo hoo)
Before it's too late
(Let's wait awhile)
Wait awhile
(Our love will be great)
Let's wait awhile
(Wait awhile, oh
Before we go too far, oh, oh, oh

Let's wait awhile
(Let's just take our time)
Before it's too late
(Let's wait awhile)
Your love's so good
(Our love will be great)
We shouldn't rush in
(Let's wait awhile)
Slow it down
(Before we go too far)
Oh

La da lee de da da de de de, da da da da la da
La da lee de da da de de de, da da da da la da da
La da lee de da da de de de

I promise, I'll be worth the wait
