Hello, everyone, this is your action news reporter with all the news that is news across the nation, on the scene at the supermarket.
There seems to have been some disturbance here. Pardon me, sir, did you see what happened?


Yeah, I did. I's standin' overe there by the tomaters, and here he come, running through the pole beans, through the fruits and vegetables, nekkid as a jay bird.
And I hollered over t' Ethel, I said, "Don't look, Ethel!" But it's too late, she'd already been incensed.


Here he comes, look at that, look at that
There he goes, look at that, look at that
And he ain't wearin' no clothes

Oh yes, they call him the Streak
(Look at that, look at that)
Fastest thing on two feet
(Look at that, look at that)
He's just as proud as he can be
Of his anatomy
He goin' give us a peek

Oh, yes, they call him the Streak
(Look at that, look at that)
He likes to show off his physique
(Look at that, look at that)
If there's an audience to be found
He'll be streakin' around
Invitin' public critique


This is your action news reporter once again and we're here at the gas station. Pardon me, sir, did you see what happened?


Yeah, I did. I's just in here gettin my car checked, he just appeared out of the traffic.
Come streakin' around the grease rack there, didn't have nothin' on but a smile.
I looked in there, and Ethel was gettin' her a cold drink.
I hollered, "Don't look, Ethel!" But it was too late.
She'd already been mooned. Flashed her right there in front of the shock absorbers.


He ain't crude, look at that, look at that
He ain't lewd, look at that, look at that
He's just in the mood to run in the nude

Oh, yes, they call him the Streak
(Look at that, look at that)
He likes to turn the other cheek
(Look at that, look at that)
He's always makin' the news
Wearin' just his tennis shoes
Guess you could call him unique


Once again, your action news reporter in the booth at the gym, covering the disturbance at the basketball playoff.
Pardon me, sir, did you see what happened?


Yeah, I did. Half time, I's just goin' down thar to get Ethel a snow cone.
And here he come, right out of the cheap seats, dribbling, right down the middle of the court.
Didn't have on nothing but his PF's. Made a hook shot and got out through the concessions stand.
I hollered up at Ethel, I said, "Don't look, Ethel!"
But it was too late. She'd already got a free shot.
Grandstandin', right there in front of the home team.


Oh, yes, they call him the Streak
(Look at that, look at that)
The fastest thing on two feet
(Look at that, look at that)
He's just as proud as he can be
Of his anatomy
He's gonna give us a peek


Here he comes again.
Who's that with him?
Ethel? Is that you, Ethel?
What do you think you're
doin'? You git your
clothes on!


Oh, yes, they call him the Streak
(Look at that, look at that)
He likes to show off his physique
(Look at that, look at that)
If there's an audience to be found
He'll be streakin' around
Invitin' public critique

Ethel! Where you goin'?
Ethel, you shameless
hussy! Say it isn't so,
Ethel! Ethelllllll!
