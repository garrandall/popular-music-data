This I swear is true

My love for you will last
Till time itself is through
Oh, my darling, oh, my darling
This I swear is true
(Swear is true)

My heart is yours my dear
There will be no one new
Oh, my darling, oh, my darling
This I swear is true
(Swear is true)

I promise you that I
Will never make you cry
This love will be eternally
Cross my heart and hope to die

My lips will kiss I vow
Nobody else but you
Oh, my darling, oh, my darling
This I swear is true
(This I swear is true)

This I swear is true
This I swear is true
This I swear is true

This I swear is true
This I swear is true
This I swear is true
This I swear is true
Oh
