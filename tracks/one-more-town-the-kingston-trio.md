If there's one more town, I'll be goin'. Fight for the winnin' and I'll be there
If there's one more song, I'll be singin'. I'm always goin' but I don't know where

I spent seventeen in West Virginia. Eight more years just for runnin' free
But the girls back home in their blue gingham dresses only heard one thing from me

If there's one more town, I'll be goin'. Fight for the winnin' and I'll be there
If there's one more song, I'll be singin'. I'm always goin' but I don't know where

Went down to New Orleans last summer on a flat boat workin' my way
There were well-mannered ladies and street that were shady, but for me, I never could stay

If there's one more town, I'll be goin'. Fight for the winnin' and I'll be there
If there's one more song, I'll be singin'. I'm always goin' but I don't know where

Sailed up to New York on a schooner, but I won't be stayin' there long
There were bright city lights and girls in pink tights but their faces were all painted on

If there's one more town, I'll be goin'. Fight for the winnin' and I'll be there
If there's one more song, I'll be singin'. I'm always goin' but I don't know where
