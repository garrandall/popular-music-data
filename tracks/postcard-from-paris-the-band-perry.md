I remember when my heart caught the fever.
You were standing all alone in the summer heat.
I was with my boyfriend, my new boyfriend;
He was as sweet as he could be.
But one look at you and I was through
My heart switched up on me.

Like a postcard from Paris when I've seen the real thing.
It's like finding out your diamond is from her old promise ring.
A call back from your fortune teller, she read your cards upside down.
The meanest thing you ever did is come around
And now, I'm ruined.

In the evening you can catch me daydreaming.
Did that moment send you reeling just like me?
I should have gone over, right over.
I should have never let you leave.
But it's the never-knowing that keeps this going and drives me crazy.

Like a postcard from Paris when I've seen the real thing.
It's like finding out your diamond is from her old promise ring.
A call back from your fortune teller she read your cards upside down.
The meanest thing you ever did is come around.

Just when I thought things were alright,
My eyes play tricks on my mind, yeah.
Will I ever be satisfied cause all I ever seem to find is a

Postcard from Paris, when I need the real thing.
It's like finding out your diamond is from an old promise ring.
A call back from your fortune teller she read your cards upside down.
The meanest thing you ever did, the cruelest thing you ever did,
The meanest thing you ever did is come around.

I am ruined, yeah I'm ruined.
Now I am ruined, yeah I'm ruined
