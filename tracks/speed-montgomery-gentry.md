I'm tired of spinning my wheels 
I need to find a place where my heart can go to heal 
I need to get there pretty quick 
Hey mister what you got out on that lot you can sell me in a pinch 

Maybe one of them souped up muscle cars 
The kind that makes you think you're stronger than you are 
Color don't matter no I don't need leather seats 
All that really concerns me is 

Speed 
How fast will it go 
Can it get me 
Over her quickly 
Zero to sixty 
Can it outrun her memory 
Yeah, what I really need 
Is an open road 
And a whole lot of speed 

I'd like to trade in this old truck 
Cause it makes me think of her and that just slows me up 
See, it's the first place we made love where we used to sit and talk 
On the tailgate all night long but now she's gone 
And I need to move on 
So give me 

Speed 
How fast will it go 
Can it get me 
Over her quickly 
Zero to sixty 
Can it outrun her memory 
Yeah, what I really need 
Is an open road 
And a whole lot of speed 

Throw me them keys so I can put some miles between us 
Tear off that rearview mirror there's nothing left to see here 
Let me lean on that gas 
Oh she catches up fast 
So give me 

Speed 
How fast will it go 
Can it get me 
Over her quickly 
Zero to sixty 
Can it outrun her memory 
Yeah, what I really need 
Is an open road 
And a whole lot of speed 

That's what I need 
I'm tired of spinning my wheels 
I'm tired of spinning my wheels
