Here I stand I'm just a shell of a man
And only a kiss ago I was yesterday's hero
When you were mine I had it made
I was the leader of the big parade
Now look at me I'm yesterday's hero, hero

How their cheers used to sing in my ears
With you walking by my side I was a conquering hero
But no one even says hello
They say that idols come and idols go
Well I oughta know I'm yesterday's hero, hero

Now the glamour and the glory's gone
But will the story of our love be live on
Or fade away like yesterday's hero
Like yesterday's hero
Yeah yesterday's hero
