I do
Take you for the rest of my life
Through sickness and through health
Through good times and through bad
For richer or for poor
To cherish and to love
We kissed and then we became man and wife

Baby
Years from now we'll never regret
Oh, how could we forget
All the vows we made
Until death do we part

I do
Take you for the rest of my life
Through sickness and through health
Through good times and through bad
For richer or for poor
To cherish and to love
We kissed and then we became man and wife

Baby
Years from now we'll never regret
Oh, how could we forget
All the vows we made
Until death do we part

Oh, how could we forget
All the vows we made
Until death do we part
