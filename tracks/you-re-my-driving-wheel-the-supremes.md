You're my driving wheel
Feels good, baby
You take me farther, oh
Than I've been before
Ride, ride, ride, ride
You're my driving wheel
Feels so good, baby
Just one touch, ow, oh
Opens up my door
You're the engine that keeps me running
You're the motor that keeps me coming
To the road that keeps on winding
Coming to the love, I keep on finding
Every time you touch me
Starts my motor running
I like the way you keep it humming
Keeps my motor running
I like the way you keep it humming
Hey, you're my driving wheel
You better believe it, baby
You take me farther, whoo
Than I've been before
Than I've been before, yeah
You're my driving wheel
My driving wheel, baby
Just one touch, ow
Opens up my door
Opens up my door
Ain't a road in life I can't travel
As long as I know you're there
Ain't no map, I can't unravel
As long as I know you care
Every time you touch me
Starts my motor running
I like the way you keep it humming
Keeps my motor running
I like the way you keep me humming, oh
You're my driving wheel
I can't hear ya now
You take me farther
Than I've been before
Than I've been before
You're my driving wheel
You keep me moving, babe
Just one touch
Opens up my door
Opens up my door, yeah
You're my driving wheel
Driving wheel, baby
You take me farther, oh
Than I've been before
Than I've been before
You're my driving wheel
Drive me crazy, baby
Just one touch
Opens up my door
Opens up my door, yeah
You're my driving wheel
My driving wheel, baby
You take me farther
Than I've been before
Yeah, yeah, oh
You're my driving wheel
You keep me moving, babe
Just one touch
Opens up my door
You're my driving wheel
You keep me moving, baby
You take me farther
Than I've been before
You're my driving wheel
You keep me groovin', baby
Just one touch
Opens up my door
You're my driving wheel
You drive me crazy, baby
You take me farther
Than I've been before
Than I've been before
You're my driving wheel
You're my driving wheel, baby
Just one touch
Just one touch
Opens up my door
Opens up my door, yeah
You're my driving wheel
You keep me moving, baby
You take me farther
You take me farther
Than I've been before
Than I've been before
You're my driving wheel
You keep me groovin', baby
Just one touch
Just one touch
Opens up my door
Opens up my door
