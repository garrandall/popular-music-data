When you were eight
And you had bad traits
You go to school
And learn the golden rule
So why are you
Acting like a bloody fool?
If you get hot
Then you must get cool


Bad boys, bad boys
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do
When they come for you?
Bad boys, bad boys
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do
When they come for you?

You chuck it on your mother
And you chuck it on your father
You chuck it on your brother
And you chuck it on your sister
You chuck it on that one
And you chuck it on me

Not a soldier mona give you no break
Not even you idren naw give you no break

Why did you have to act so mean
Don't you know you're human being?
Born of a mother with the love of a father
Reflection comes and reflection goes
I know sometimes you want to let go
Hey hey hey
I know sometimes you want to let go


Bad boys, bad boys

When they come for you?
(You're too bad, you're too rude)

And you chuck it on your father
You chuck it on your brother
And you chuck it on your sister
You chuck it on that one
And you chuck it on me


Bad boys, bad boys
