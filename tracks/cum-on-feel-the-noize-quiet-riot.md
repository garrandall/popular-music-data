Cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild

So you think I got an evil mind
I tell you honey

I don't know why
I don't know why

So you think my singin's out of time
It makes me money

I don't know why
I don't know why
Anymore
Oh no

So cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild

Cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Baby!

So you say I got a funny face
I got no worries

And I don't know why
I don't know why

Oh I gotta sing with some disgrace
I'm in no hurry

And I don't know why
I don't know why
Anymore
No no no

Cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild

Cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We get wild, wild, wild
Baby
Come on!

Well you think we have a lazy time
You should know better

I don't know why
I don't know why

So you say I got a dirty mind
I'm a mean go getter

I don't know why
I don't know why
Anymore
Oh no

Cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild

Cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Baby!

Come on, (come on) feel it
Girls rock your boys (come on, rock it!)
We'll get wild, wild, wild
We're gonna get wild! (wild, wild, wild)
We're gonna get rocked tonight (cum on feel the noize)

Rock it tonight (girls rock your boys)
We'll get wild, wild, wild
OH YEAH!

Ah, ah, ah (woooo)
Ah, ah, ah

Cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
