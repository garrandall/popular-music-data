There is no place like home
There is no place like home

Do you remember
You left this morning at nine
With everything fine
Welcome home, baby
(Oh oh oh)
It's been a long, long time
(Long, long time)

Do you remember
(Oh oh oh)
That little stain on your lips
Where honey drips
Welcome home, baby
(Oh oh oh)
It's been a long, long time
(Long, long time)

(Well)
Well
(Well)
Well, at ten o'clock I was lonely and blue
At twelve o'clock I thought of nothing but you
From two o'clock till a quarter of four
I waited patiently to hear your footsteps at the door

Do you remember
(Oh oh oh)
That little stain on your lips
Where honey drips
Welcome home, baby
(Oh oh oh)
It's been a long, long time

Welcome home, baby
(Oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
It's been a long, long time
Welcome home
