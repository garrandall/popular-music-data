Got a feeling in my heart
That it's time for us to start
To sing, sing together again

We can sing high
We can sing low
It's all the same, you know
Sing it high and sing it
Sing it low

Got a feling in my soul
We can sing a song
That we all know
So come now
Let's sing together again

We can sing high
We can sing low
It's all the same, you know

It's your lucky day now
It's your day
It's your lucky day now
It's your day

When you think straight
Straight, clean and simple
And no matter what you may do
It's all coming right back to you

Yes, it is, yes, it is
Yes, it is, yes, it is
Yes, it is, yes, it is
Yes, it is, yes, it is

Got a feeling in my heart
That it's time for us to start
To sing, sing together again

We can sing high
We can sing low
It's all the same, you know
Sing it high and sing it
Sing it low

Sing it high and sing it
Sing it low, yeah

Sing it high, high, high
Sing it low

Sing it high, sing it high
Sing it high, sing it low
