I'm her yesterday man
Well, my friends that's what I am
I'm her yesterday man
Well, my friends that's what I am
That's what I am, her yesterday man

Please tell me something have you met an angel
Someone too lovely to live on earth
Well, yesterdeay I thought I met an angel but
She wasn't worth all she seemed to be worth

And, oh, what a fool I have been
I was sure taken in

Yeah, I'm her yesterday man
Well, my friends that's what I am
I'm her yesterday man
Well, my friends that's what I am
That's what I am, her yesterday man
(Gone is the look of love she had last night)

There's some of the good kind and some of the bad kind
Some of the others are in between
But all that I can say she is the worst kind
Well, I think you know what I mean

And yet in spite all that I say
I'd take her back any day

Now I'm her yesterday man
Well, my friends that's what I am
I'm her yesterday man
Well, my friends that's what I am
That's what I am, her yesterday man
(Gone is the look of love she had last night)

Oh, come a little closer, baby
Don't get tell me
You gonna leave me, you leave me
(Gone is the look of love she had last night)
I know that, I know that
I know that, I know that

(Gone is the look of love she had last night)
I know, I know...
