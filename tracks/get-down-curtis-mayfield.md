Get down, baby
To the funky, funky, funky groove
Get down, baby
Let the light reflect upon your natural mood
Get down, baby
Your creative mood shall express itself
Get down, baby
After life and desire there is nothing left


We're all children of the world
A hungry man in search for a hungry girl
It's strange, so plain we're all cannibal
The most wasted and two faced of all animals


Get down, get down
Get down, get down


Take my soul, baby
When you reel I can feel so much desire
Take my soul, baby
Life unfolds from my soul when you start a fire


So get down, just get down


Get down, baby
As the rhythm should follow through your able soul
Get down, baby
Play the part like a pro in a perfect role
Get down, baby
To the funky, funky, funky groove
Get down, baby
Let the light reflect upon your natural mood


One can never point out the actual path
Of the mysterious need in a female's heart
Man can only follow not knowing how
His faith might erupt, and his only proud


So get down, get down
Get down, get down
Get down


Get down, baby
To the funky, funky, funky groove
Get down, baby
Let the light reflect upon your natural move
Take my soul, baby
Your creative mood shall express itself
Take my soul, baby
After life and desire there is nothing left


Get down, get down
Get down, get down
Get down, get down
Get down, get down
