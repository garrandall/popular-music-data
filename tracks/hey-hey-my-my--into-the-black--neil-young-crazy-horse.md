Hey hey, my my
Rock and roll can never die
There's more to the picture than meets the eye
Hey hey, my my

Out of the blue and into the black
You pay for this, but they give you that
And once you're gone, you can't come back
When you're out of the blue and into the black

The king is gone, but he's not forgotten (Johnny Rotten, Johnny Rotten)
Is this the story of Johnny Rotten? (Johnny Rotten, Rotten Johnny)
It's better to burn out 'cause rust never sleeps
The king is gone, but he's not forgotten

Hey hey, my my
Rock and roll can never die
There's more to the picture than meets the eye
