Out of the blue, out of the night
You came along and you changed my life
You got me feeling things, I swear I never felt before
You looked at me, that's all it took
You read my heart like an open book
Well, it was true love- right from the start
True love- straight from my heart
True love- ain't no doubt about it, baby
True love- now I can't live without it
Before I met you baby, I was alone
Thought I was happy livin' on my own
But now I realize this world was made for two, like me and you
With you by my side, everything's fine
There ain't no mountain, sugar, we can't climb
We got a true love- that's all we need
True love- it's got a lifetime guarantee
True love- so hard to find
True love- put your heart on the line now
True love- makes every day a little brighter

True love- makes every burden just a little lighter
True love- it'll make you be a better man
If you had true love, you'd understand
Out of the blue, out of the night
You came along and you changed my life
You got me feeling things, I swear I never felt before
You lift me up, you make me strong
You give me lovin' lastin' all night long
When it's a true love- right from the start
True love- straight from my heart
True love- need you here beside me baby
True love- need your love to guide me
True love- I can't deny this feelin' no no matter how hard I try
I just know what I feel, and it's a true love
She's my baby, she's my girl
She changed my life, oh, she changed my world
She's my buttercup, oh, fill me up
Talkin' about love, talkin' about love, it's gotta be a true love
