Yeah, I miss you but I got no time for that
How could you? Wish you had never played me

Claiming you're my lady, got no time for that
How could you move it like you're crazy?

Yeah, I miss you but I got no time for that
You was my lil' lady, drive me crazy
I was fine with that (Damn)
How you just gon' play me? I ain't fine with that
Thinking 'bout you daily
Smoking crazy while I'm off the tech (Damn)
Flexin', oh, we was flexing
Always had told you that you'd be a star
Goals in our checklist (Damn)
Question, oh, check your message
Knew that I couldn't fuck the bitch from the start
Or she was texting (Damn)
Demon, she cold (Yeah)
Leave and I'm gone (Yeah)
Fiendin', she on (Yeah)
Dreaming, we are (Yeah)
Drop is a coupe
Dropping the top of my car (Ayy)
I cannot love on no bitch when she fucking the clique
Man, she playing her part (Yeah, damn, ayy)
Life is a bitch, knew all that shit from the start (Ayy)
I told myself I walk up from that bitch and she leave all that shit in the dark (Like damn)


Leave me alone
Drunk as fuck
Bitch, you dumb as fuck
Running up the bucks (Damn, ayy)
Leave me alone
Drunk as fuck
Bitch, you dumb as fuck
Bitch, you done or what? (Yeah)
Leave me alone
Drunk as fuck
Bitch, you dumb as fuck
Running up the bucks (Damn)
Leave me alone
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


You can't play me, I'm just wavy
Sipping purple 'til I'm lazy
Like a throwback
Ayisyen, how you ain't know that?
Hit my bop like I'm Lil Kodak
On the block where it ain't good at
I can't sweat you, I'm like, "Who that?"
I can't sweat you, I don't do that (Nah, nah, ayy)
Tell you the truth
I ain't want you to depart (Ayy)
I wanted you but I can't fuck with you
'Cause you different, you can't play your part (No, damn, ayy)
Tell you the truth
I wanted you from the start (Ayy)
I cannot fuck on no bitch
I can't love when the bitch is not playing her part (Like damn)


Leave me alone
Drunk as fuck
Bitch, you dumb as fuck
Running up the bucks (Damn, ayy)
Leave me alone
Drunk as fuck
Bitch, you dumb as fuck
Bitch, you done or what? (Yeah)
Leave me alone
Drunk as fuck
Bitch, you dumb as fuck
Running up the bucks (Damn, ayy)
Leave me alone
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
