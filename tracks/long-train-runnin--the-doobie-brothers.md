Down around the corner
A half a mile from here
You see them long trains runnin'
And you watch them disappear

Without love
Where would you be now
Without love

You know I saw Miss Lucy
Down along the tracks
She lost her home and her family
And she won't be comin' back

Without love
Where would you be right now
Without love

Well the Illinois Central
And the Southern Central Freight
Gotta keep on pushin' Mama
'Cause you know they're runnin' late

Without love
Where would you be now - now, now, now
Without love



Well the Illinois Central
And the Southern Central Freight
Gotta keep on pushin' Mama
You know they're runnin' late

Without love
Where would you be now
Without love

When pistons keep on churnin'
And the wheels go 'round and 'round
And the steel rails lie cold and hard
For the miles that they go down

Without love
Where would you be right now
Without love

Where would you be now

Gotta get ya, baby, baby
Won't you boogie down?
Won't you boogie down?

Baby, baby, baby, baby
Won't you boogie down?

Where the big trains run
When the trains are movin' on

Ya gotta keep on movin'
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin'
Won't ya keep on movin'
