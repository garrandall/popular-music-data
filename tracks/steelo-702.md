I'm gonna keep it real
How you make me feel
Boy you give me chills, baby
I'm gonna break it down
You just drive me wild whenever you're around


You know how I do
And you know how I flow
Can I get your name and number
Cause I like your steelo
And I dig the way you move
And the way you do your thing
Baby you can bring it on
You can swing it this way


Boy it's something about you
That make me tell my friends
But they don't understand no, no
They don't know your style
With your high profile
The fliest thing in town


You know how I do
And you know how I flow
Can I get your name and number
Cause I like your steelo
And I dig the way you move
And the way you do your thing
Baby you can bring it on
You can swing it this way


You stay on my mind
Think about you all the time
Got to get to know you well
If you kiss then I won't tell
You stay on my mind
Think about you all the time
Got to get to know you well
If you kiss then I won't tell

Kiss me, oh hold me
I say squeeze me, oh squeeze me whoa
Kiss me, oh hold me
I say squeeze me, whoa, kiss me


One two uh
Check it, check it, check it out
Follow, follow me
Many, many, many miles
One two, check it out
Lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme break you down
This track is nasty like punani
Word to Mommy I like Joe but he sloppy, dag
Poppy got a brand new bag, for real
I take and 'Quel O'neil like Shaq, Shaq
Ask Michael Jackson who Bad
He says I am but the queen not drag
I'm bad enough to let my pants sag
I be in Vegas where 702 be at
Check it out


You know how I do
And you know how I flow
Can I get your name and number
Cause I like your steelo
And I dig the way you move
And the way you do your thing
Baby you can bring it on
You can swing it this way
