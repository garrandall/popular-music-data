One start in my room
One stars on my foot
And my car it go vroom
How I'm smoking makin good
I go hard in the plume
Catch a thot
Yes I could, yes I do
Betty boo
Beat that pussy red and blue
All you see sauce n cheese
What I be, Dominos?
I got weed, ay baby come with me
VÃ¡manos
Leave my skeet on her teeth
Then she geek
VÃ¡manos, Domino's
On a roll, I go where I wanna go
Drop a bomb like that gap man
What's up, what's happenin?
I'm high, I'm lazy like a fat man
These is cookies, this is not Afgan
I don't even talk to her, and I've been thinkin shawty
On her hulu watchin Rick n Morty
Seen her history
She been clickin for me
See my video
Micky mouse polo sporty
Monkey see monkey do
Two death beds
One for me one for you
Sayin bitch I'm the man
Broccoli in my soup
Who ain't me
Watch me feed
Checkin heads in a coup
Mama just killed a man
Shittin on y'all was a part of the plan
Takin me down not a part of the plan
You'd have better luck takin your college exam
Keepin her crotch wet like a cruise ship
Oh shit
Reachin to the presence for my pulpit
True shit
Kissin proof my dick gettin smooches
Oh shit
I think I was born to be a nuisance
Move bitch
Ay lemme tell you bout the uzi oh
Little off a weekday
Went and fucked a bitch and I did it all for pete's sake
I walk in the post office "fuck is with the delay"
Happy birthday I got you an eka
Disgusting
All my bones rusting
Hoes gon' be lusting
Guns gon' be busting
Friend go foe I be out here adjusting
Always by myself, so who really am I trusting?
No one
Not a damn soul
Damn my lil bitch is a handful
I be in distress with a damsel
But you ain't really gotta have brains to give sum
How you wanna ask me about my income
Bitch I make enough for myself to spend some
You lose
I win sum and win sum
Move bitch out the way
Your hoe see me she salivate
Trouble man like Marvin Gaye
Oh no don't you start today
You might fade away
Your times up I hate to say
Threw me on the bed
She had it made
Allow me to elaborate
She don't like you geek
She like come up
Had my nut strangin on her like kimono
Spit it out on your bib that's a no no
Smart lady give me brain now she a dodo
Bless the rains down in africa like todo
Said I beat the pussy red and need sum?
Like the powerpuff girls did mojo
Is it too little too late to fuck jojo
One start in my room
One stars on my foot
And my car it go vroom
How I'm smoking makin good
I go hard in the plume
Catch a thot
Yes I could, yes I do
Betty boo
Beat that pussy red and blue
All you see sauce and cheese
What I be, dominos
I got weed, ay baby come with me
VÃ¡manos
Leave my skeet on her teeth
Then she geek
VÃ¡manos, dominos
On a roll, I go where I wanna go
