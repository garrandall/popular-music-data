Oh yeah


My parents think I'm crazy, and they hate the things I do
I'm stupid and I'm lazy. Man, if they only knew


How flaming youth will set the world on fire
Flaming youth, our flag is flying higher and higher and higher


My uniform is leather, and my power is my age
I'm getting it together to break out of my cage


'Cause flaming youth will set the world on fire
Flaming youth will set the world on fire
Flaming youth, our flag is flying higher and higher and higher


Flaming youth will set the world on fire
Flaming youth will set the world on fire
Flaming youth will set the world on fire
Flaming youth will set the world on fire
Flaming youth will set the world on fire
Flaming youth, our flag is flying higher and higher
And higher and higher and higher and higher and higher
