Ah
Ah

(Doo doo doo doo doo-doo)
(Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo)

Don't you wonder sometimes
About sound and vision?

Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live
Blue, blue
Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to do, nothing to say
Blue, blue
I will sit right down
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude
Over my head

Don't you wonder sometimes
About sound and vision?
