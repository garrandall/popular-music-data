Drifting into my solitude
Over my head

Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision
Aah-Aahh...

Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live
Blue-ooh

Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to read
Nothing to say
Blue-ooh

I will sit right down
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision

And I will sing
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision

Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision
Aah-Aahh...

Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live
Blue-ooh

I will sit right down
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision

And I will sing
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision

Drifting into my solitude
Over my head
