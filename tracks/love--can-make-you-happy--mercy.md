My heart is steadfast O God
And I will sing
With all my heart and soul
Music for the King
And I will awake the dawn
With my praise to you O Lord

How great is Your love
So much higher than the heavens
With faithfulness that reaches the sky
How great is Your love
So much higher than the heavens
With faithfulness that reaches the sky
O How great is Your love
Oh yeah

Praise the Lord O My Soul
And glory to the King
Forever You are robed with majesty
We come to You O Lord
And lay our praise at Your feet

How great is Your love
So much higher than the heavens
With faithfulness that reaches the sky
How great is Your love
So much higher than the heavens
With faithfulness that reaches the sky

Be exalted O God and let Your glory reign
Be exalted O God and let Your glory reign
Let it reign
Let it reign
Let it reign
Let it reign
Let it reign
Let it reign

How great is Your love
So much higher than the heavens
With faithfulness that reaches the sky
How great is Your love
So much higher than the heavens
With faithfulness that reaches the sky
