I've been hurt, hurt, hurt
Yes I've been hurt
I've been hurt like I've never been hurt before
Cause you cheated, cheated, cheated, cheated on me, girl
Yes, you told me a whole lot of lies
And you lied, you lied to me
Leave me alone, little girl
Cause I've been hurt
What happened, happened, happened, happened last night
I saw you with another guy
Was holding you tight
And you lied, you lied to me
Leave me alone, little girl
Cause I've been hurt
I've been hurt, hurt, hurt
Yes I've been hurt
Cause you cheated, cheated, cheated, cheated on me, girl
I've been hurt, hurt, hurt
Yes I've been hurt
Cause you cheated, cheated, cheated, cheated on me, girl
I've been hurt, hurt, hurt
Yes I've been hurt
Oh, yes you cheated, cheated, cheated, cheated on me, girl...
