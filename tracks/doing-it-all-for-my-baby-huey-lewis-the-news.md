Early in the morning, I'm still in bed 
She comes to me with sweet affection 
Wakes me with kisses, "Hello sleepyhead." 
Gets me moving in the right direction 
I do my best to give her love that lasts forever 
It seems like everything I do I'm doing better

Doing it all for my baby 
Because she's as fine as she can be 
Doing it all for my baby 
For everything she does for me

Later in the evening, it's been a busy day 
She lays her head upon my weary shoulder 
Listen to her laughing, snuggle up and say 
Now I'm with you baby, the loneliness is over 
I do my best to give her love that lasts forever 
It seems like everything I do I'm doing better

Doing it all for my baby 
Because she's as fine as she can be 
Doing it all for my baby 
For everything she does for me
