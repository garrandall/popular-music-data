Givin up is hard to do
When you really love someone
Givin up is hard to do
When you still depend upon
His warm and tender touch
His kiss and his caress
That used to mean so much
And bring you happiness
(Givin up) Oh, Lord, is hard to do
I try, but its just no use
(Givin up) Whoa, Lord, its hard to do
I tried, but I kept recluse
The light of hope burns dim
But in my heart I pray
My love, my love, my love and faith in him
Will bring him back someday
(Givin up)
But its just no use
(Givin up)
No, I can't break loose
Whether he knows or not
He really needs me too
Oh, Lord,1 oh, Lord, oh, Lord, hes all Ive got
And giving up
Is so hard to do (Givin up)
Oh, yes, it is (Givin up)
Is so hard to do (Givin up)
Oh, yes, it is (Givin up)
I just can't break loose (Givin up)
No, no, no (Givin up)
I just can't break loose (Givin up)
No, no, no, no (Givin up), hey, hey, hey
