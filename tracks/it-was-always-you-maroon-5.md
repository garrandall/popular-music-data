Woke up sweating from a dream
With a different kind of feeling
All day long my heart was beating
Searching for the meaning


Hazel eyes, I was so colorblind
We were just wasting time, oh oh
For my whole life, we never crossed the line
Only friends in my mind, but now I realize


It was always you
Can't believe I could not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now, I know it was always you, always you


All my hidden desires
Finally came alive, oh
No, I never told a lie
To you, so why would I start tonight?


Hazel eyes, I was so colorblind
We were just wasting time, oh oh
For my whole life, we never crossed the line
Only friends in my mind, but now I realize


It was always you
Can't believe I could not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now, I know it was always you, always you


Woke up sweating from a dream
With a different kind of feeling


It was always you
Can't believe I could not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now, I know it was always you, always you
