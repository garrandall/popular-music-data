Voice your choice
Voice your choice

Voice your choice
Tell me who do you love
Am I the one, oh... Oh...
That you're thinkin' of

You know you look so good
Oh, oh, it's really a crime
For just one girl
Yeah, to be so fine

You've got all the boys
Standing in line
Tell me who do you love
Girl, make up your mind
Make up your mind

Voice your choice
Tell me who do you love
Am I the one, oh... Oh...
That you're thinkin' of

You know Jim, he's sincere
Oh, oh, and Joe, he's fine
Johnny's nice
Yeah, but is he the one

Then there's me
Who's the last but not the least
So come on now
Girl, speak your peace
Speak your peace

Voice your choice (Oh, tell me who do you love)
Voice your choice (Oh, girl, yeah)
Voice your choice (Oh, girl, yeah)

Tell me, girl, what you're gonna do
And tell me what you are trying to prove
Girl, you don't need two
No, when one will do
So come on now, say it's me and you
Me and you

Voice your choice (Oh, tell me who do you love)
Voice your choice (Oh, girl, yeah)
Voice your choice (Oh, girl, yeah)
Tell me who do you love (Oh, tell me who do you love)
