Honey you've been fibbin'
Tellin' me such lies
Know that you've been givin'
Every guy the eye

Honey you've been foolin'
From the very start
Think of what you're doin'
To my achin' heart
Don'tcha know I'm sighin' ?
Don'tcha know I'm crying' ?
Don'tcha know I'm tryin' ?
To believe yuh ?

Oo, Oo, Oo, Honey I'm just livin'
For a love that's true
When you stop you fibbin'
I'll come back to you

Honey you've been fibbin'
Tellin' me such lies...
