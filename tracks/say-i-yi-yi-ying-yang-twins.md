This ain't no lie yi yi
Ying Yang bringing that fi yi yi
Smoking on dro, We stay hi yi yi
Rolling on dubs like I yi yi
I yi yi


Real ass niggaz gon po within a reason
Feeling like some drama gon come, Get niggaz bleedin
Ping brain little life chances
Ambulances, And plenty murder man dances, ha!
And for the niggaz that be popping that lip
how high I tip, Tearing body fleshes off of the rip
Like a lady when she having a fucking new born
The doctor holla push, and her skin is torn a child is born

 
We poping the pistals
Making dem whisals
Slanging dem thangs
Still keeping the pistal down on ther brain
And yeah we changing the game
Cuz we be spittin some shit
That sound good when you hear it make your bitch turn trick
Cuz its the year of the year 
Yang bring that pain
Twins all in your city 
Looking at ass and titties
And ride twenties
On big boy trucks, Doing big boy stuff
We big boy rid er and big boy drive




Hol up, Wait a minute
Let me put my two cent in it
Some of yall 
Say you mean it
But we, Repasent it
We gon keep it twerkalaten
Ask these niggaz why they haten
Anticipaten
Standing in the line tryna buy my tape
After they, Purchase it
Then a mothafucka say 
Why we hate on ying yang
All we doin is spiitin game
Some of yall mouves has, Gotta be to weak
Falling in love with a straight ho


Major money makas, Papa chasas, On the grin for chips
Tryna make a million dollars before its time to dip
So real niggaz make your money man
Flip the script or flip your bird
Sell that co-cain, Its on you
Do what you gotta do to make a livin
Get you a gat
Go out and rob a tyte boy while your pimping
Its better ways, Better days if you look at it
But your ass to fat
You hopping like a jack rabbit




Stuck, Fuck, down on my luck and!
Brought me a truck
And the motor blew up man!
Shit been hard for me fo real
For bout five yeas
My life been a fucking down hill
It seems like im married to her fucking da-dy
Cuz i live through this shit but I neva eva win
A victim of circumstance
They give me no second chance
They come and they naked dance 
So come fight and be a man


You make a nigga knock a pussy mothafucka stop your self
While you running off at the mouth you better watch your self
So dag on
Move away, Nigga move (move)
And let a mothafucka get thew (get thew)
Ying yang in this thang
And we ain't gon change
Fuck me
Naw nigga
Fuck you
Keep it real
For dem niggaz ans hoes 
Who be throwing dem bows
Getting crunk at dem shows
Smoking nothing but dro
