She got her hands all on her knees, and then her bows on her thigh
She like to twerk and that's for certain 'cause I can tell she fi'e
She got me hype, I wanna bite it right now yi, yi
Say, I yi, yi, yi, yi
Oh


Look at shawty snap, make that ass clap
Niggas in the club spendin' dubs when it's phat
Thick and real fine, standin' five-nine
High heels on, right on time
Goddamn. look at shawty, she makin' that ass jiggle
I like the way it wobbledy, wobbledy when it wiggle
Anybody down for my nursery rhyme riddle?
Some of these hoes be for the creamin' in the middle


She shakin' ass and gettin' paid, because she makin' her cheese
She ain't scared to get on the floor to show her ass and titties
If she doin' it quite right, I might just give her fifty
I've be drinkin' Hennessy, so I'm damn near tipsy
I know them hoes in the club, they ain't twerkin' for free
If she dancin' like she should, she'll make her money
I like them freaky ass hoes, twitchin' asses for me
Ah shit, that's it, so I'm spendin' my cheese


She got her hands all on her knees, and then her bows on her thigh
She like to twerk and that's certain 'cause I can tell she fi'e
She got me hype, I wanna bite it right now yi, yi
Say, I yi, yi, yi, yi
She got her hands all on her knees, and then her bows on her thigh
She like to twerk and that's certain 'cause I can tell she fi'e
She got me hype, I wanna bite it right now yi, yi
Say, I yi, yi, yi, yi
Oh


Gentlemen club, let me see ya, I yi, yi
Blue Flame, let me see ya, I yi, yi
Magic City, let me see ya, I yi, yi
Body Tap, let me see ya, I yi, yi
Jazzy T's, let me see ya, I yi, yi
Club Pleasers, let me see ya I yi, yi
School hoes, let me see ya, I yi, yi
And if you ain't twerkin', bitch, bye yi yi


Shawty, let me see ya shake it on the floor, butt-naked
Show-stoppin', pussy-poppin', damn, I like the way you take it
Up and down, side to side, round and round, touch the ground
There you go, now you know, how you gotta make your cash flow
Put them poles, touch them toes, let me see that ass roll
All in the booty club, shawty shake it for the dub
High as a kite, so I might stick your ass a lil' somethin'
Make that pussy pull a blunt


She got her hands all on her knees, and then her bows on her thigh
She like to twerk and that's certain 'cause I can tell she fi'e
She got me hype, I wanna bite it right now yi, yi
Say, I yi, yi, yi, yi
She got her hands all on her knees, and then her bows on her thigh
She like to twerk and that's certain 'cause I can tell she fi'e
She got me hype, I wanna bite it right now yi, yi
Say, I yi, yi, yi, yi
Oh


Hoes shakin' ass like a real freak
Tryin' to get the motherfuckin' ends meat
Don't be tryin' to motherfuckin' tease me
'Cause I'm 'bout tipped on the Hennessy
But I still give you a dub, doe
But you gotta shake that ass, ho
Work real hard for the cash flow
Bring yo' ass to the dance flow


One time for them bitches at that gentlemen's club
Them bitches shakin', ain't no fakin', and they came for the dubs
Them niggas hatin' steady, waitin', so we can't come back
I'm on the track about to snap, while she work that cat
Pussy poppin', shawty droppin', say she gon' get low
She an average every day government cheese ho
Fuck them niggas, who dem niggas that be hatin' on the guys
They in the club with them thugs screamin', I yi, yi


She got her hands all on her knees, and then her bows on her thigh
She like to twerk and that's certain 'cause I can tell she fi'e
She got me hype, I wanna bite it right now yi, yi
Say, I yi, yi, yi, yi
She got her hands all on her knees, and then her bows on her thigh
She like to twerk and that's certain 'cause I can tell she fi'e
She got me hype, I wanna bite it right now yi, yi
Say, I yi, yi, yi, yi
She got her hands all on her knees, and then her bows on her thigh
She like to twerk and that's certain 'cause I can tell she fi'e
She got me hype, I wanna bite it right now yi, yi
Say, I yi, yi, yi, yi
Oh
