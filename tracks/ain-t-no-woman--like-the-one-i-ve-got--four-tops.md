She said her name was (paradise)
Thats what she said to me
She said (paradise)
Thats what she said it would be
Cuz she, the finest women that ive ever did see
And not to mention how she looked in them jeans

She said her name was (paradise)
Thats what she said to me
She said (paradise)
Thats what she said it would be
Cuz she was, the definition of a ghetto queen
And you should see that apple bottom in jeans

I met her on a sunday, one day
She walkin down the runway
5'5''
So fine what the fuck im gon say
And i just sit patiently just waiting my turn
Waiting for my perfect chance so i can spit out my words
I think she openly spokenly damn i hope she notices me
Hopefully she go for me
So she on the boat with me
And ima take her places she can never imagine
Like water ski'in in costa rica
With snow mobiling in aspen
She prefer the cold
Winter, snow
And does she like tropical
Am i dreamin let me know
Tell me is it possible
That i could be the one she in search for a man
And she could be that one that end my search for romance
No time to slack now, act now, ima bout to crack now, i put my rap down, mack down,
Aint no turning back now
I got the this feeling that she feelin the same
About to end this feeling games and just ask her her name



So the next day monday
Im riding down the freeway
Hit her on the 2 way
Im like what you doing tuesday
She said that she was free anytime after 3
And every second after that will be reserved for me
I said thats good to know say no mo'
Ill be there around 4
Around 4 that fo' do
Phantom at your front door
You can take it for a ride 
Keep it in papas sake
Debate it at fate and the
Reservations at 8
And after dinner, champagne, walks along the beaches
With the moonlight shines on ya features
And i cant create the words to explain myself
My temtation to feel ya body
Temtation to kiss them curves
One kiss two kiss she all on my neck now
Three kiss four kiss im all on her neck now that
Temperatures rising
Hips and thighs coming
Hynotizing man i dont wanna stop
It feels like



They dont understand me because i really dont understand myself
I cant live with out (my girl)
Paradise is mine mayne
Anywhere and time mayne
She gon hold it down cuz she (my girl)
She love me she love me not
She love me to be on top
She love daddy to spank her cuz she (my girl)
And if you got ne doubts just ask when you see me out
Ill tell you who im talken bout
My Girl
