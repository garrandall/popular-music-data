(Ain't no woman like the one I've got.)
(Ain't no woman like the one I've got.)
(Ain't no woman like the one I've got.)

Every day the sun comes up around her
She can make the birds sing harmony
Every drop of rain is glad it found her
Heaven must have made her just for me
When she smiles so warm and tender
A sight for sore eyes to see

Oh, (ain't no woman like the one I've got.)
Oh, no, they don't come better
(To make her happy doesn't take a lot.)
She don't ask for things, no diamond rings
(So together, like a hand in glove.)
Like pages in a letter
(Ain't no woman like the one I love.)

She can fill me up when it's down I'm goin' (I'm goin')
Put a little music in my day
Wouldn't be surprised if my love keeps growin' (it keeps growin')
Bigger every minute that she stays away
I would kiss the ground she walks on
'Cause it's my word, my word she'll obey, now
Woo-oh (Ain't no woman like the one I've got.)
Well, I kiss the ground she walks on
(To make her happy doesn't take a lot.)
She's a real good friend right to the end
(So together like a hand in glove.)
A lonely man when she's gone
(People, ain't no woman like the one I love.)

Oh. What a good, good thing I've got
She means to me a lot

(Ain't no woman like the I've got.)
No, no, they don't come better
(To make her happy doesn't take a lot.)
She don't ask for things, no diamond rings
(So together, like a hand in glove.)
Like pages in a letter
(Ain't no woman like the one I love, people.)

(Ain't no woman like the one I've got.)
Well, I kiss the ground she walks on
(To make her happy doesn't take a lot.)
I'm a lonely man when my baby's gone
