My daddy taught me in this country everyone's the same 
You work hard for your dollar and you never pass the blame
When it don't go your way
Now I see all these big shots whining on my evening news
About how they're losing billions and it's up to me and you
To come running to the rescue

Well, pardon me if I don't shed a tear
They're selling make believe and we don't buy that here

Because in the real world they're shuttin Detroit down
While the boss man takes his bonus paid jets on out of town
DC's bailing out them bankers as the farmers auction ground
Yeah, while they're living up on Wall Street in that New York City town
Here in the real world they're shuttin Detroit down
Here in the real world they're shuttin Detroit down

Well that old man's been working in that plant most all his life
Now his pension plan's been cut in half and he can't afford to die
And it's a crying shame, 'cause he ain't the one to blame 
When I looked down to see his calloused hands 
Well let me tell you friend it gets me fightin mad

'Cause in the real world they're shuttin Detroit down
While the boss man takes his bonus paid jets on out of town
DC's bailing out them bankers as the farmers auction ground
Yeah, while there living up on Wall Street in that New York City town
Here in the real world they're shuttin Detroit down

Yeah while they're living up on Wall Street in that New York City town
Here in the real world they're shuttin Detroit down
Here in the real world they're shuttin Detroit down
In the real world they're shuttin Detroit down
They're shuttin Detroit down
