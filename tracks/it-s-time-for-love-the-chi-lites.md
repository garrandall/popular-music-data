Showed that I loved you
When you gave me your heart
I love you too much
To ever tear it apart

When I kiss you, dear
The Earth moves under my feet

And church bells ringing
The angels singing
Church bells ringing
And the angels singing

Be by my side
Forever and forever
Just you and me
Just you and me

It's time, time for love
Baby, it's time, time for love

You have the flowers blooming
In the middle of the night
Whisper to me baby
While I'm holding you tight

You are the answer
To why I cannot sleep

And church bells ringing
The angels singing
Church bells ringing
And the angels singing

Wherever you go
I'll be there in the shadows
Just waiting for you
Just waiting for you

Baby, it's time, time for love
The clock on the wall will tell you
The look in my eyes will tell you
It's time for love

Baby, it's time, time for love
Oh, it's time, time for love...
