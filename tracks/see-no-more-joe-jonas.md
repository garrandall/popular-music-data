Oh, I don't wanna see no more


It was Saturday when I got that call
Far away from feeling tall
I know, I know, I know what the truth is, yeah
I tried to look away from what you did
Heartache became my friend, oh, whoa, whoa


You walked away from me, baby
I would've never done the same
You made me feel like our love was not real
You threw it all away, so


I don't wanna wait for you
I don't wanna wake up thinking, hoping you'll get it right this time
'Cause you know that you’re so cold
I don't wanna see no more and I can’t get away from you
It's one of the reasons why that I just can't get you out my mind
And all I keep seein' is your picture


But I don't wanna see no more (oh, oh)
But I don't wanna see no more (oh, oh)
I don't wanna see no more (oh, oh)
I don't wanna see no more (oh, oh)
I don't wanna see no more


It was so easy to trust you, baby
Guess I was so stupid, baby, hey, yeah, oh
I didn't ever think that this would come
You’re running right to another one


You walked away from me, baby
You threw it all away (You threw it all away), so...


I don't wanna wait for you
I don't wanna wake up thinking, hoping
You'll get it right this time
'Cause you know that you’re so cold (So cold)
I don't wanna see no more
And I can’t get away from you
It's one of the reasons why
That I just can't get you out my mind
And all I keep seeing is your picture


But I don't wanna see no more (no more)
But I don't wanna see no more (no more)
I don't wanna see no more (oh, oh)
I don't wanna see no more (oh, oh)
I don't wanna see no more


I used to be afraid of letting go
The fragile part me
I’m here right now, I need you to set me free
I can see it in your eyes
That you won’t blame on me this time
No, never
And I want you back, but I won’t look back, no


I don't wanna wait for you
I don't wanna wake up thinking, hoping
You'll get it right this time
'Cause you know that you’re so cold
I don't wanna see no more
And I can’t get away from you
It's one of the reasons why
That I just can't get you out my mind
And all I keep seeing is your picture


But I don't wanna see no more (oh, oh)
But I don't wanna see no more (oh, oh)
I don't wanna see no more (oh, oh)
I don't wanna see no more (oh, oh)
I don't wanna see no more
