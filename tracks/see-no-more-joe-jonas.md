And I don't wanna see no more
Oh Oh (And I don't wanna see no more)
It was Saturday when I got that call
Far away from feeling tall
I know, I know, I know what the truth is
Yeah
I try to look away from what you did
Heartache became my friend

You walked away from me baby
I would've never done the same
You made me feel like our love was not real
You threw it all away, so

I donât wanna wait for you
I donât wanna wake up thinking, hoping
You will get it right this time
âCause you know that youâre so cold
I donât wanna see no more
And I canât get away from you
Itâs one of the reasons why
That I just canât get you out my mind
And all I keep seeing is your picture
I donât wanna see no more
I donât wanna see no more
I donât wanna see no more
I donât wanna see no more
I donât wanna see no more

It was so easy to trust you baby
Guess I was so stupid baby
Oh, I didnât ever think that this would come
Youâre running right to another one, oh

You walked away from me baby
You threw it all away, so

I donât wanna wait for you, no, no
I donât wanna wake up thinking, hoping
You will get it right this time
âCause you know that youâre so cold
I donât wanna see no more
And I canât get away from you
Itâs one of the reasons why
That I just canât get you out my mind
And all I keep seeing is your picture
I donât wanna see no more (no more)
I donât wanna see no more (no more)
I donât wanna see no more
I donât wanna see no more
I donât wanna see no more

I used to be afraid of letting go
The fragile part of me, Iâm here right now
I need you to set me free
I can see it in your eyes
That you wonât blame it on me this time
No, never
You might want me back but I wonât look back, no

I donât wanna wait for you
I donât wanna wake up thinking, hoping
You will get it right this time
âCause you know that youâre so cold
I donât wanna see no more
And I canât get away from you
Itâs one of the reasons why
That I just canât get you out my mind
And all I keep seeing is your picture
I don't wanna see no more.
I don't wanna see no more.
I don't wanna see no more.
I don't wanna see no more.
I don't wanna see no more.
