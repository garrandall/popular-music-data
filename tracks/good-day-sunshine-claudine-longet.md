Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

I need to laugh
And when the sun is out
I've got something
I can laugh about

I feel good
In a special way
I'm in love and
It's a sunny day

Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

We take a walk
The sun is shining down
Burns my feet
As they touch the ground

Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

And then we lie
Beneath a shady tree
I love him and he's loving me

He feels good
He know he's looking fine
I'm so proud to know
That he is mine

Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
