Two black Cadillacs driving in a slow parade
Headlights shining bright in the middle of the day
One is for his wife,
The other for the woman who loved him at night
Two black Cadillacs meeting for the first time

And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn't bother to cry
Bye-bye, bye-bye

They took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He's not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye

Two black Cadillacs, two black Cadillacs

Two months ago his wife called the number on his phone
Turns out he'd been lying to both of them for oh so long
They decided then
He'd never get away with doing this to them
Two black Cadillacs waiting for the right time, the right time

And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn't bother to cry
Bye, bye, bye, bye

They took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He's not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye

It was the first and the last time they saw each other face to face
They shared a crimson smile and just walked away
And left the secret at the grave

And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils they didn't bother to cry
Bye-bye, bye-bye

They took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He's not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye
