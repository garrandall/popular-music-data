Way down in the state of Georgia among the swamps and the everglades
There's a big hole in Tiger Mountain
God help the men who gets lost in Miller's Cave
I had a girl in Waycross Georgia but she had unfaithful ways
She made me feel I was unwanted
Like the bats and the bears in Miller's Cave
I caught her out Sunday morning with some guy they call Big Dave
The meanest man in Waycross Georgia
I'd rather fight a mountain lion in Miller's Cave
So I said you're gonna pay both you and Davy
Cause I'm gonna see you in your grave
They laughed at me and then I shot 'em
And then I dragged their cheatin' skin and bones into Miller's Cave
I couldn't stand the way she did me cause I guess I showed her I was brave
The most wanted man in the state of Georgia
But they'll never gonna find me cause I'm lost in Miller's Cave
