You need a love that will not change
You want a lover to remain
Forever yours
Oh, but you don't have to worry
You never have to fear
Through thick and thin I'll always be here

I'll be your bridge over and through troubled waters
You never have to face it alone
And when the world seems to treat you unfair
Baby, for you I'll always be there

I won't be no fairweather friend
I'll be there till the end
Even through stormy weather
Time and time again

I won't be no fairweather friend
I'll be there till the end
Even through stormy weather
Time and time again, oh

Sometimes I know it's rough for you
And then there are times you're hurt and blue
Got so much pain
Oh, but I'm the kind of person
Who can take the hurt away
You never have to suffer again

I'll be your strength to carry you over the mountain
To lift you up when you're fallin' down
Baby, be strong, you can believe in me
'Cause I'm your friend and I'll always, always, always be right there

I won't be no fairweather friend
I'll be there till the end (Oh...)
Even through stormy weather (Even through stormy weather)
Time and time again (Oh)

I won't be no fairweather friend (Never, never, never let you)
I'll be there till the end (I'll never, never let you go)
Even through stormy weather (Through the storm, through the rain)
Time and time again, oh

I'll lay your head on my-my shoulder
I'll lay your head up on my shoulder
I'll be, I'll be
I will be right there for you
Through the bad times, my baby
I'll be your sunshine, woo, woo
Time and time again

Ah...ah...
Ah...ah...
Oh, baby, for you I'll always be there
Oh

I won't be no fairweather friend
I'll be there till the end
Even through stormy weather
Time and time again

I won't be no fairweather friend
I'll be there till the end
Even through stormy weather
Time and time again

Baby, I know what's right for you
Maybe sometimes you're feelin' blue
But I won't let ya, I won't let ya
You're never gonna face no pain again

'Cause baby, no mountain's high enough
I'm gonna be there to lift you up
Baby, call my name and I'll be there
I'll lay your head on my-my shoulder
I'll lay your head up on my shoulder
I'll be, I'll be, I will be right there for you

Through the bad times, my baby
I'll be your sunshine, woo, woo
Time and time again

I won't be no fairweather friend
I'll be there till the end
Even through stormy weather
Time and time again

I won't be no fairweather friend
I'll be there till the end
Even through stormy weather
Time and time again
