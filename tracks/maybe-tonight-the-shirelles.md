(All through the lonely day, I pray with all my might
And then once more I say, maybe, maybe tonight)

Tonight could be the night when you kiss and hold me

Chorus
Oh maybe tonight (maybe maybe, maybe tonight)
Maybe tonight (maybe maybe, maybe tonight)
Maybe tonight (maybe maybe, maybe tonight)
Maybe tonight (maybe baby, maybe baby)

Tonight could be the night when you say things you never told me

I've tried so hard to show you how I care
Every chance I get, oh yeah
How blind can you be why can't you see
That I love you, I need you and I want you so bad

Tonight could be the night when my, my lucky star will shine
Oh maybe tonight (maybe maybe, maybe tonight)
Maybe tonight (maybe maybe, maybe tonight)
Tonight's the night (maybe maybe, maybe tonight)
It just has to be tonight (maybe baby, maybe baby)

(All through the lonely day, I pray with all my might
And then once more I say, maybe, maybe tonight)

Tonight (maybe maybe, maybe tonight)
I said it should be tonight (maybe maybe, maybe tonight)
Tonight, just has to be tonight (maybe baby, maybe baby)
(Repeat and fade)
(Maybe maybe, maybe tonight
Maybe maybe, maybe tonight
Maybe baby, maybe baby)
