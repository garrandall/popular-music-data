Babe I had a dream
Woke up in a sweat
Darkness all around me
I was caught in its net
Tried to reach for you
But you weren't there
It only was a dream
But it put danger in the air 
I can feel the nervous rhythm
of your heart with mine
Could we ever stay together
Stand the test of time
Baby make me a believer 
Cause this world will lie
(Oh these times are hard for lovers)
It's getting harder for you and me
It's hard on me and you 
Baby we can make it 
Cause our love will pull us through
These times are hard for lovers
It's down to me in you
Nothing's gonna break us
If we hang on to what's true
These times are hard for lovers
I believe in you
These times are hard for lovers
I believe in you 
Everywhere you turn
Trouble going on
Living under pressure
Loving under the gun
It's hard enough to live
Draw another breath
Hang on to me baby
Like it's life or death 
I can feel the nervous rhythm of your heart with mine
Could we ever stay together
Stand the test of time
Baby make me a believer 
Cause this world will lie
(Oh these times are hard for lovers)
It's getting harder for you and me
It's hard on me and you 
Baby we can make it 
Cause our love will pull us through
These times are hard for lovers
It's down to me in you
Nothing's gonna break us
If we hang on to what's true
These times are hard for lovers
I believe in you
These times are hard for lovers
I believe in you 
Can you feel the nervous rhythm of your heart with mine
Could we ever stay together
Stand the test of time
Baby make me a believer 
Cause this world will lie
We've got to go the distance
Touch the sky 
Baby we can make it 
Cause our love will pull us through
These times are hard for lovers
It's down to me in you
Nothing's gonna break us
If we hang on to what's true
These times are hard for lovers
I believe in you
(These times are hard for lovers whoa)
Whoa
(These times are hard for lovers oh yeah)
(These times are hard for lovers whoa)
Whoa
(These times are hard for lovers oh yeah)
I believe in you
(These times are hard for lovers whoa)
When I turn to you
(These times are hard for lovers oh yeah)
Yeah
But I don't believe it
(These times are hard for lovers whoa)
Yeah
(These times are hard for lovers oh yeah)
Whoa
(These times are hard for lovers whoa)
Baby I believe in you
(These times are hard for lovers oh yeah)
Baby I believe in you
(These times are hard for lovers whoa)
Baby I believe in you
(These times are hard for lovers oh yeah)
