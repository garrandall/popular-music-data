I'm gonna make you love me
Just you wait and see
Though it may take a year
I'll make you fall in love with me

'Cause nobody else will do now
I want you now
And I'll keep on trying

Baby, you can ignore me
Whenever I come around
Treating me cruel
Call me a fool but
Baby, I'll be your clown

And hide all my hurting inside
And tuck my pride in,
And keep on trying

Yeah, yeah
I'm gonna keep on trying
Mmm, yeah
I'm gonna keep on trying

They say a constant drop of water
Can tear a stone apart
Baby, I'll take
Constant love and break
The wall around your heart

You can't drive me away now
Gonna stay now
And keep on trying

Yeah, yeah
I'm gonna keep on trying
Mmm, yeah
I'm gonna keep on trying

Maybe I'm being stubborn
Maybe I'm wasting time
But stubborn, I'll be
Until I see that
You will never be mine

And I'll try forgetting about you
Living without you
And keep on trying

Yeah, yeah
I'm gonna keep on trying
Mmm, yeah
I'm gonna keep on trying

Mmm, yeah
I'm gonna keep on trying...
