Cant be more obvious
Shes in pain
Wont even let me in
From the rain

All the windows are locked again
She's afraid
Of everything that I have to say
To her face. 

So try to look in my eyes
And tell me you're not surprised
Cause nothing's changing
Everyone has to lie sometimes
Do you know what its like to make up your mind
Tell me do you know who's innocent
While the world is spinning 

It couldn't be more obvious
I'm in pain
She won't even let me in
From the rain

And all the pictures in the frames are cracked
Cause I'm afraid
Of everything they're gonna say
Behind my back  

So try to look in my eyes
And tell me you're not surprised
Cause nothings changing
Everyone has to lie sometimes
Do you know what its like to make up your mind
Tell me do you know who's innocent
While the world is spinning 

So try to look in my eyes
And tell me you're not surprised
Cause nothings changing
Everyone has to lie sometimes
Do you know what it's like to make up your mind
Tell me do you know who's innocent
While the world is spinning
