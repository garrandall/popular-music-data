Not a word from your lips
You just took for granted that I want to skinny dip
A quick hit, that's your game
But I'm not a piece of meat, stimulate my brain
Night is young, so are we
Let's get to know each other better, slow and easily
Take my hand, let's hit the floor
Shake your body to the music, maybe then you'll score

So come on, baby, won't you show some class?
Why you want to move so fast?

We don't have to take our clothes off (Mmm...)
To have a good time, oh no
We could dance and party all night
(All night, we could dance all night)
And drink some cherry wine, uh-huh
We don't have to take our clothes off (No, no, no)
To have a good time, oh no
We could dance and party all night (All night)
And drink some cherry wine, uh-huh

Na, na, na, na, na-na-na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na-na-na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na-na-na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na-na-na, na, na

Just slow down if you want me
A man wants to be approached cool and romantically
I've got needs just like you
Gimme conversations, good vibrations, through and through

So come on baby, won't you show some class?
Why you want to move so fast?

We don't have to take our clothes off (No, no)
To have a good time, oh no
We could dance and party all night (all night, all night)
And drink some cherry wine, uh-huh (Oh, no, no, oh)
We don't have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no (A good time, oh no)
We could dance and party all night (Party, all night)
And drink some cherry wine, uh-huh (Cherry wine, uh-huh)

Na, na, na, na, na-na-na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na-na-na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na-na-na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na-na-na, na, na

Yes, I want your body
And we don't have to rush the affair
So you say, you wanna taste my wine?
Not yet

So come on, baby, won't you show some class?
Why you wanna move so fast? (Oh-oh)

We don't have to take our clothes off (Oh no)
To have a good time, oh no
We could dance and party all night (Dance and party all night)
And drink some cherry wine, uh-huh (We don't have)
We don't have to take our clothes off (Clothes off, no)
To have a good time, oh no (Oh no)
We could dance and party all night (Dance and party, yeah)
And drink some cherry wine, uh-huh (Cherry wine)

Na, na, na, na, na-na-na, na, na (Oh-oh)
Na, na, na, na, na-na-na, na, na (Na-na, na-na)
Na, na, na, na, na-na-na, na, na (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Na, na, na, na, na-na-na, na, na (Oh...)

We don't have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no
We could dance and party all night (All night, all night long)
And drink some cherry wine, uh-huh (Cherry wine, cherry wine)
We don't have to take our clothes off (No...)
To have a good time, oh no
We could dance and party all night (Dance and party, yeah)
