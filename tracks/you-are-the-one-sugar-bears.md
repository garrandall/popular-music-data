I got a feeling for you
That I just can't hide any more.
Nobody else in the world
Ever made me feel this way before.
I've been afraid to show it,
But now you've got to know it.
Baby, baby
I'm in love with you

And I want to spent the rest of my life with you.
You brighten up the world with everything you do.
Baby, you're my morning sun
You are the one.
Oh baby, you're my morning sun
You are the one.

Ever since I can remember
I've just been looking around.
You came along and I couldn't believe
What a good thing I found.
I've got to scream and shout it.
There's no more doubt about it.
Baby, baby
No one else will do

Baby you know that I needed you so
Please don't turn me away.
Now that you know I've been feeling about you
There's so much to say.
But you've got to know it baby,
I want you more than maybe
Tell me, tell me
You could love me too

Ohbaby, you're my morning sun
