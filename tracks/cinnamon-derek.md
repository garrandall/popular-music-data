 "Hey, can Derek come out and play?"


I was cruising round the back of my dads 
Should focus on the road stead of trynna to entertain us
For the cops make em stop and they try to detain us
Voted class clown so you can't really blame em
Saturday cartoons with the tv turnt up
Running round the house with my little bo cut
Banging pots and pans til my parents both woke up
A wild child, so I didn't give no fucks
A bowl of cinnamon toast crunch for brunch a simple kid
Boloney mayo mustard sandwich for lunch
Wasn't ready for the veggies we had Petes for dinner
My momma tried to force feed me so at her I spit em
She had the cream cuts and the all black Lexus
Sunday on the way to church dad drove separate
Little did I know his ass was hung over
Momma man get out the road before you ass get run over

A lot of things change they ain't never the same
New pain, new game couple friends of the fake
See our parents tried to warn us that this life is tough
One things for sure I don't wanna grow up

You couldn't get me in the house I'm out round the clock
Ride our mongoose bike up and down the block
But the neighbourhood bully tried to make us stop til we ganged up on his ass and made his mom call the cops
Used to hit the local pool on a hot summer day
Posted under shade trynna look at the baes
I would squint I would stare man look at her legs
I didn't care about my age I was trynna get laid
Got home momma mad I know what she gonna ask
Always seem to get in trouble and my teeth just clash
Try to blame it my friends like well he be bad
Guess what today I'm about to teach your ass
Momma always took care of our cuts and coats
Tryna hold this shit together like some nuts and bolts
Dads outta town working least that's were told
And we ain't know the truth till we both got grown

A lot of things change they ain't never the same
New pain, new game, couple friends of the fake
See our parents tried to warn us that this life is tough
One things for sure I don't wanna grow up

It was December 24th, 97 I see the pastor in a porse got my eye on the Reverend collect plate overflowing he thinking he slick
And his reason like bish I grow up too quick
I can't believe that saint nick all a myth
Caught him sneaking round the house in my daddies kicks
I woke up in the morning to a bag of gifts
Knowing damn well Santa ain't wrapped that shit
Knew too much enough for someone double my age but not enough always seemed to struggle with grades
Thought I have it figured out but I didn't know what to do one things for sure I grew up too soon

A lot of things change they ain't never the same
New pain, new game, couple friends of the fake
See our parents tried to warn us that this life is tough one thing for sure I don't wanna grow up, grow up
I don't wanna grow up, grow up (one things for sure) I don't wanna grow up grow up I don't wanna grow up (one things for sure) I don't wanna grow up, grow up
