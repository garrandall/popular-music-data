If I could hug my love, could I try
For your wings to cover me and let them fold
Half alive I hurt the most brilliant lie
Sleepless eyes, close the light
And rest your mind while you burn

Can't stutter when you're talking with your eyes
By cutting out your tongue you save face
Feeding on the blood lets running from a big day

Cry on black rain, cry on black rain
Cry on black rain

If I could hug my love could I try
for your wings to cover me unless I fall
Sleepless eyes, close the light
And rest your mind while you burn

You can't stutter when you're talking with your eyes
By cutting out your tongue you save face
Feeding on the blood lets running from a big day

Cry on black rain, Cry on black rain
Cry on black rain

You can't stutter when you're talking with your eyes
By cutting out your tongue you save face
Feeding on the blood lets running from a big day
