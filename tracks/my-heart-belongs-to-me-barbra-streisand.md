I got the feelin' the feelin's gone
My heart has gone to sleep
One of these mornings I'll be gone
My heart belongs to me
Can we believe in fairy tales?
Can love survive when all else fails?
Can't hide the feelin' the feelin' s gone
My heart belongs to me
But now my love, hey didn't I love you
But we knew what had to be
Some how my love I'll always love you
But my heart belongs to me
Put out the light and close your eyes
Come lie beside me, don't ask why
Can't hide the feelin' the feelin's gone
My heart belongs to me


But now my love, hey didn't I love you
Didn't I love you, didn't I love you, didn't I love you, baby!
Don't cry my love, I'll always love you
But my heart belongs to me
I got the feelin' the feelin's gone
My heart belongs to me...
I got the feelin' the feelin's gone
My heart belongs to me...


Didn't I love you, didn't I love you
