Uh well, dance all night play all day
Don't let nothin' get in the way
Dance all night keep the beat
Don't you worry 'bout two left feet
Shake it up
Shake it up, oo yeah
Shake it up

Well dance all night get real loose
You don't need no bad excuse
Dance all night with anyone
Don't let nobody pick your fun
Shake it up, oo-oo
Shake it up, yeah yeah

That's right I said dance all night (go go go)
And dance all night (get real low)
Go all night (get real hot)
Well, shake it up "now", all you've got, woo

Uh well dance all night and whirl your hair
Make the night cats stop and stare
Dance all night go to work
Do the move with quirky jerk
Just shake it up, oo-oo
Shake it up, oo yeah
Shake it up, that's right
Shake it up

Uh well dance all night (go go go)
"Get so light" (get real low)
Dance all night (get real hot)
Shake it up, all you've got, woo

Shake it up, make a scene
"Let them know" what you really mean
And dance all night keep the beat
Don't ya worry 'bout two left feet
Shake it up, oo-oo
