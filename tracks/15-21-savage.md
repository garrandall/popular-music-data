Lyrics from Snippet

I'm from Atlanta, bitch, I bring my gun everywhere
Left the crime scene like I was never there
Said he wanted smoke, but he got Teddie bears
Put a hundred shots in his 
Diamonds in my piss, won't shake hands with a snitch
, if he die, if he don't, jump his shit
It ain't hard to find me, I'm in the cater of the city
High-speed chase, I can't get caught with the stick
Valentine's Day, I play 2K and that's it
You took her out to eat and then she sucked on his dick
I'm not Little Debbie, I'm not cakin' no bitch
