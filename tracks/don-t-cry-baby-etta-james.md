Don't cry, don't cry baby
Don't cry baby
Dry your eyes, and let's be sweethearts again
And oh, cuz you know
You know I didn't mean
To ever treat you so mean
C'mon, c'mon sweetheart
And let's try it over again

And oh, don't cry
Don't cry baby
Don't cry, don't cry
Dry your eyes, and let's be sweethearts again
And oh, cuz you know I didn't mean
To ever treat you so mean
C'mon, c'mon sweetheart
And let's try it over again

Repeat
