You go on your way
I'll go on mine
Please don't you call me
Or drop me a line

I'll be better off now
With somebody new
And you should find someone
More suited to you

Cause we're wrong for each other
Wrong for each other
Let's fight another round

I couldn't explain it
I can't tell you why
I've got such a talent
For making you cry

And one day you'll thank me
For saying so long
For making an end to
A love that was wrong

Cause we're wrong for each other
Wrong for each other
Let's fight another round

Cause we're wrong for each other
Wrong for each other
Wrong for each other
Wrong for each other
