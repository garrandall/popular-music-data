We had joy,
We had fun,
We had seasons in the sun;
But the hills we would climb
Were just seasons out of time.
All our lives we had fun,
We had seasons in the sun;
But the stars we could reach
Were just starfish on the beach.

Adieu, emile,
My trusted friend,
We've known each other
Since we were nine or ten;
Together we climbed hills and trees,
Learned of love
And a-b-c's,
Skinned our hearts
And skinned our knees.
Adieu, emile,
It's hard to die,
When all the birds are singing in the sky;
Now that the spring is in the air,
Pretty girls are ev'rywhere;
Think of me
And I'll be there.



Adieu, papa,
Please pray for me,
I was the black sheep of the family;
You tried to teach me
Right from wrong,

Too much wine
And too much song,
Wonder how I got along.
Adieu, papa,
It's hard to die,
When all the birds are singing in the sky;
Now that the spring is in the air,
Little children ev'rywhere;
When you'll see them, I'll be there.



Adieu, francoise,
My trusted wife,
Without you I'd have had a lonely life;
You cheated lots of times,
But then,
I forgave you in the end,
Tho' your lover was my friend.
Adieu, francoise,
I'ts hard to die,
When all the birds are singing in the sky;
Now that the spring is in the air,
With your lovers ev'rywhere;
Just be careful,
I'll be there.

All our lives we had fun,
We had seasons in the sun;
But the stars we could reach
Were just starfish on the beach
