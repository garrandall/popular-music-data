Trapped in a prison,
in a prism of light.
Alone in the darkness, 
a darkness of white.
We fell in love, 
alone on a stage,
in the reflective age.

Entre la nuit, la nuit et l'aurore.
Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts.


If this is heaven,
I don't know what it's for.
If I can't find you there,
I don't care.

I thought I found a way to enter;
it was just a reflector. (Just a reflector)
I thought I found the connector;
it was just a reflector. (Just a reflector)

Now the signals we send
are deflected again.
We're so connected, 
but are we even friends? 

We fell in love when I was 19,
and now we're staring at a screen.

Entre la nuit, la nuit et l'aurore.
Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts.

If this is heaven,
I need something more.
Just a place to be alone,
cause you're my home.

I thought I found a way to enter;
it was just a reflector. (Just a reflector)
I thought I found the connector;
it was just a reflector. (Just a reflector)
Just a reflector.

It's just a reflector, just a reflector.
It's just a reflector, just a reflector.
Just a reflector, reflector.

Just a reflector. 

Just a reflection of a reflection
of a reflection of a reflection of a reflection (ah!),
but I see you on the other side.
We all got things to hide.

Just a reflection of a reflection
of a reflection of a reflection of a reflection (ah!),
but I see you on the other side.
We all got things to hide.

(Alright let's go back.)

Our song it skips
on little silver disks.
Our love is plastic, 
and they break it to bits.

I want to break free, 
but will they break me
down, down down,
don't mess around.

I thought I found a way to enter;
it was just a reflector. (Just a reflector)
I thought I found the connector;
it was just a reflector. (Just a reflector)

It's just a reflector. 

Thought you were praying to the resurrector;
turns out it was just a reflector. (Just a reflector)
Thought you were praying to the resurrector;
turns out it was just a reflector. (Just a reflector)
Thought you were praying to the resurrector;
turns out it was just a reflector. (Just a reflector)

Just a reflector.
Just a reflector.
Just a reflector.

But I see you on the other side.

Just a reflector.

(Ah!)

But I see you on the other side. (Reflector)
We all got things to hide. (Reflector)

Just a reflector.

But I see you on the other side.
