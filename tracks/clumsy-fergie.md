She can't help it, the girl can't help it (Oh, baby!)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (Oh, baby!)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (Oh, baby!)
She can't help it


First time that I saw your eyes
Boy, you looked right through me, mmm, mmm
Played it cool, but I knew you knew
That cupid hit me, mmm, mmm


You got me trippin' (Oh), stumblin' (Oh), flippin' (Oh), fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (In - in, love - love)
You got me slippin' (Oh), tumblin' (Oh), sinkin' (Oh), crumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (In - in, love - love)
So in love with you


She can't help it, the girl can't help it (Oh, baby!)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (Oh, no!)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (No how!)
She can't help it


Can't breathe, when you touch my sleeve
Butterflies so crazy, mmm, mmm
Whoa now, think I'm goin' down
Friends don't know what's with me, mmm, mmm


You got me trippin' (Oh), stumblin' (Oh), flippin' (Oh), fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (In - in, love - love)
You got me slippin' (Oh), tumblin' (Oh), sinkin' (Oh), crumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (In - in, love - love)
So in love with you


She can't help it, the girl can't help it (Oh, no!)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (Oh, please!)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (Oh, no!)
She can't help it


You know, this ain't the first time this has happened to me
This "love sick" thing
I like serious relationships and, uh
A girl like me don't stay single for long
'Cause every time a boyfriend and I break up
My world is crushed and I'm all alone
The love bug comes right back up and bites me
And I'm back!


She can't help it, the girl can't help it (In love!)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (Oh, God!)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (I'm back in love!)
Can't help it (Oh, whoo, oh!)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (I'm back in love now!)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (I'm back in love now, baby!)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (I'm back in love now!)
She can't help it (And now you got me)


You got me trippin' (Oh), stumblin' (Oh), flippin' (Oh), fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (In - in, love - love)
You got me slippin' (Oh), tumblin' (Oh), sinkin' (Oh), crumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (In - in, love - love)
So in love with you
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (In - in, love - love)
You got me slippin' (Oh), tumblin' (Oh), sinkin' (Oh), crumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (In - in, love - love)
So in love with you
So in love with you
So in love with you
