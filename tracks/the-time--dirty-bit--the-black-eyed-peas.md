(This is international)
(Big mega radio smasher)


I had the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear this is true
And I owe it all to you


Oh I had the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear this is true
And I owe it all to you-y-y-y-y-yy-y-y-y

... dirty bit
... dirty bit


I-I came up in here to rock
Light a fire make it hot
I don't wanna take no pictures
I just wanna take some shots so
Come on let's go
Let's lose control
Let's do it all night
'Till we can do it no more
People rock it to the sound
Turn it up and watch it pound
We gon' rock it to the top
'Till the roof come burning down
Yea it's hot in here
The temperature
Has got these ladies gettin' freakier


I got freaky, freaky, baby
I was chillin with my ladies
I didn't come to get boji
I come here to get crazy
I was born to get wild
That's my style
If you didn't know that,
Well baby now you know now,


'Cause I'm
Havin'
A good time with you
I'm tellin' you


I had the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear this is true
And I owe it all to you


Oh I had the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear this is true
And I owe it all to you y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y

... dirty bit
... dirty bit


A-All these girls they like my swagger
They callin me Mick Jagger
I be rollin like a stone
Jet setter, Jet lagger
We ain't messin' with no maggots
Messin' with the baddest
Chicks in the club
Honey what's up
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest of them all
It's gotta be the apl
I'm the mac daddy, ya'll
Haters better step back
Ladies don't load you're act
I'm the party application rock it just like that

(This is international)
(Big mega radio smasher)


'Cause I'm
Havin'
A good time with you
I'm tellin' you


I-I-I-I'v had the time of my li-I-fe
And I never felt this way before-fore
And I swear-wear this is true ue-ue-ue
And I owe it all to you


Oh I-I-I I'v had the time of my li-I-fe
And I never felt this way before-fore
And I swear-wear this is true-ue-ue-ue
And I owe it all to you


I-I-I-I-I had the time of my li-I-fe
And I never felt this way before-fore
And I swear-wear this is true-ue-ue-ue
And I owe it all to you


Oh I-I-I-I'v had the time of my li-I-fe
And I never felt this way before-fore
And I swear-wear this is true-ue-ue-ue
And I owe it all to you
