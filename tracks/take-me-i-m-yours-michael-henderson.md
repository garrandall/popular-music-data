I got excited when I first heard that you
Wanted to meet me
How could I refuse?
The way you shake your hips, oh
Just drives me wild
I was leavin', but I can't leave right now
Can you come with me?
Can you?


There's always a chance
We'll surely find romance
Can we baby?
Have you been through this
Every night a different kiss?
No, until I met you


Take me (I'm yours)
(Take me)


Oh, baby, I can't forget
The way you smiled when we met
Yeah, the way you shake your hips
Oh, just drove me wild
I was leavin', guess I'm gonna be here a while
When I go, can you come with me, baby?
When I go, can you come


Have you been through this
Every night a different kiss
Not until I met you


You can take me (I'm yours)
(Take me, I'm yours)
(Take me, I'm yours)
(Take me, I'm yours)
(Take me, I'm yours)
(Take me, I'm yours)
(Take me, I'm yours)
(Take me, I'm yours)
