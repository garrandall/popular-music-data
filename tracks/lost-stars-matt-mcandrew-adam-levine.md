Please don't see
Just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies
Please see me
Reaching out for someone I can't see

Take my hand, let's see where we wake up tomorrow
Best laid plans sometimes are just a one night stand
I'll be damned, Cupid's demanding back his arrow
So let's get drunk on our tears

And God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?

And I thought I saw you out there crying
and I thought I heard you call my name
and I thought I heard you out there crying
Or just the same
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

And God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
We're searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?

And I thought I saw you out there crying
and I thought I heard you call my name
and I thought I heard you out there crying
Or just the same
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

And God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
We're searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?
