I walk along empty streets,
And night becomes another dawn.
It's only heartaches that I meet.
And tears that tell me you have gone from me.
Is it hard to see that,
My heart is breaking.
It was yours for the taking.
You said we're through,
What can I do,
When there's no you?
This time the loneliness I found,
Has taken over in my mind.
And it will always be around,
For a love like ours I'll never find, I know.
Did you have to go,
'Cause my heart is breaking.
It was yours for the taking.
You said we're through,
What can I do,
When there's no you?
My heart is breaking.
It was yours for the taking.
You said we're through,
What can I do,
When there's no you?
