I got a house down a back road
I got a flag on the front porch
I got a dog named Waylon
I got a driveway that needs paving
I got a boat with a two stroke
A couple guaranteed to make you laugh jokes
I got friends in low places
Yeah, life is what you make it

I might not end up in the hall of fame
With a star on the sidewalk with my name
Or a statue in my hometown when I'm gone
Nobody gonna name their babies after me
I might not go down in history
But I'll go down to the honky-tonk

I got a girl named Sheila
She goes batshit on tequila
I got a job that gets the job done
I got a loan at the bank, it's a big one
The only place you might see my name
Is on the wall for a good time call
I'm a local legend on a Friday night
In a Pabst Blue Ribbon neon light

I might not end up in the hall of fame
With a star on the sidewalk with my name
Or a statue in my hometown when I'm gone
Nobody gonna name their babies after me
I might not go down in history
But I'll go down to the honky-tonk

I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down, I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down, I go down to the honky-tonk

I might not end up in the hall of fame
With a star on the sidewalk with my name
Or a statue in my hometown when I'm gone
Nobody gonna name their babies after me
I might not go down in history
But I'll go down to the honky-tonk

I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down, I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down to the honky-tonk
I go down, I go down to the honky-tonk
