No one praying in the chapel
Where so many prayed before
And they've let the bells get rusty
Don't they care anymore

Rusty bells, rusty bells
Call your people back again
Call them back to kneel again and pray

Rusty bells, rusty bells
Pity those who've gone astray
Ring again and help them find the way

When will us like little children
In a forest dark as night
All we need is love to lead us
From the dark to the light

Rusty bells, rusty bells
Fill our hearts with love again
And we'll all come back again to you
Then you'll shine like new, rusty bells
