To the dance
We both came alone
I asked you
May I take you home

As we walked
I sang this song

Cherrystone
Be mine, cherrystone
I'm alone, cherrystone
You too, cherrystone

My heart just beats and beats
Repeats I love you too
Cherrystone, love you true
Cherrystone

Brought you home
Stood outside awhile
Stole a kiss and
You gave me a smile
Then I knew I walked a mile

Cherrystone
Be mine, cherrystone
I'm alone, cherrystone
You too, cherrystone

My heart just beats and beats
Repeats I love you too
Cherrystone, love you true
Cherrystone

To the dance we go
We no longer go alone
Oh, hand in hand
You oughta see us do the stroll
Happily, we're free to roll

Cherrystone
Roll on, cherrystone
Roll on, cherrystone
Rock on, Cherrystone

My heart just beats and beats
Repeats I love you too
Cherrystone, love you true
Cherrystone, oh, yes, I do
Cherrystone
