Bricksquad bachelors cookers, we get extras
Say that that's your bitch but nigga we did ask ya
Spent 10 Million dollars of VVS's
Woke up in Texas, he text me, I start flexing
Diamonds chains sexy, my pistol is my best friend
I haven't killed in so many years, I get rusty
Hustling, my 40 keep buldging in on the justice
These scary niggas calling the cops, but I ain't touched them
Finessed em, tricked them, leopards, that's on Simpson
Impress them, a victim, another lead hit successful
My weapon, F it, Join em you wanna help em
And since you said you looking for Gucci, I'm on Gresham


Don't trust me, I'll take some, I'll take some, I'll take some
Don't trust me, I'll take some, I'll take some, I'll take some
Don't trust him, he'll take some, he'll take some, we'll take some
Don't trust us, I'll take some, I'll take some, I'll take some


Worth for couple mill, still I take some
24 hours, got the base running
Sale swag bags, I got freights coming
Sale you swag pack, take it back from you
Them diamonds round your wrist, cause you a lot of problems
You scared you tuck ya ice, cause you don't want no problems
These young niggas out here hungry, they say it's no more starving
Finessing jewelry season, everybody robbing
Don't trust me, cause I'm from the streets
Going drug shoppin, cop a couple of keys
I finesse the plug, when we don't agree
Dummy bank rolls, send em over seas


Don't trust me, I'll take some, I'll take some, I'll take some
Don't trust me, I'll take some, I'll take some, I'll take some
Don't trust him, he'll take some, he'll take some, we'll take some
Don't trust us, I'll take some, I'll take some, I'll take some


Ya'll niggas know how I move, y'all niggas know what it do
Versace frames on my face, I'm a 4 eyeded fool
If I should blue with your boo, pay mine to do on my coupe
A quarter brick for the booze, at least a 4 and a deuce
You know I shoot through my jacket, you call the troops for your truce
Full metal jacket a savage, I put 3 mill on your crew
The world grenade in the room, watch all your partners kaboom
I'm a so icy tycoon, got 2 balloons in my True's
Is you gon hoe up or blow up? Is you gonn grow up or throw up
Cause I got dojos to roll up and I might pour us a 4
I can't drive a Corolla, roll around in a roller
That's a drop in Rolls Royce, y'all niggas act like you know us


Don't trust me, I'll take some, I'll take some, I'll take some
Don't trust me, I'll take some, I'll take some, I'll take some
Don't trust him, he'll take some, he'll take some, we'll take some
Don't trust us, I'll take some, I'll take some, I'll take some
