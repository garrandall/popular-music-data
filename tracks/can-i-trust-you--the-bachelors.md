Can I trust you
Will you hurt me
Should I give my
Heart and soul to you

Can I trust you
Or will I be
Just another affair
You'll be throwing away
When you're through

I've been in love before
This time, I must be sure
I've got to love again
I've got to try

Help me believe in you
So I know what to do
Don't let me make
One more mistake
Or I may die

Will you love me
For the moment
Or do I mean more
Than that to you

So, I ask you
Can I trust you
If I can, then there's
Nothing, no, nothing
That I wouldn't do

I've been in love before
This time, I must be sure
I've got to love again
I've got to try

Help me believe in you
So I know what to do
Don't let me make
One more mistake
Or I may die
