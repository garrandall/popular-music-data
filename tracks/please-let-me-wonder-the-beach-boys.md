Now here we are together
This would've been worth waiting forever
I always knew it'd feel this way
And please forgive my shaking
Can't you tell my heart is breaking?
Can't make myself say what I planned to say


Baby
Please let me wonder
If I've been the one you love
Please let me wonder
If I'm who you're dreaming of
Please let me wonder, love


I built all my goals around you
That some day my love would surround you
You'll never know what we've been through
For so long I thought about it
And now I just can't live without it
This beautiful image I have of you




I love you
