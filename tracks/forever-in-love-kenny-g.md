Thought Iâd never see your face
âCause itâs been such a long time, babe
Since we went a lot of separate ways
I never forget that day
Now youâre back to start anew
It might be burning flames
In our hearts for love thatâs true
Made it last forever

(Here we are in love again)
Donât it feel, donât it feel, donât it feel real good?
(Here we are in love again) Ohhh
Here we are in love again, tell me, girl, where have you been?
(Here we are in love again) Yeah
You say true love is blind, but our love, girl, is gonna shine
(Here we are in love again)
You know I miss your kiss, I never had a love like this

(Here we are in love again)
Waiting so long for you, girl, here we are in love again
(Here we are in love again)
Put your arms around me every night, baby, baby, baby, baby
(Here we are in love again)
Canât you feel the fire burning, burning, burning desire?
(Here we are in love again)
We can make it, make it last forever

(Here we are in love again)
(Here we are in love again)

(Here we are in love again)
(Here we are in love again)
(Here we are in love again)
(Here we are in love again)
Canât you feel the fire, burning, burning, burning desire?
