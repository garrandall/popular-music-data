Feeling better, now that we're through
Feeling better, 'cause I'm over you
I've learned my lesson, it left a scar
And now I see how you really are

You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good

I'm gonna say it again
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good

You know, I broke a heart that's gentle and true
I left a boy for someone like you
I'll beg his forgiveness on bending knee
But I wouldn't blame him if he said to me

It's no good
No good
It's no good
Baby, it's no good

Hey, I'm gonna say it louder
No good
No good
It's no good
Baby, it's no good
Mm, no good

Mm, if you help me, we'll start anew
It'll be easy, forgetting you

You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good

Oh, you know what I mean
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good

Oh, oh, oh
I'm warning you now, baby, and I'm going my way
Forget about you, baby, I'm leaving to stay

You're no good
No good
No good
Baby, you're no good

Oh, oh, I say
You're no good
No good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good
...
