Hello, everybody. I'm finally putting my YouTube videos up all in one place. People have been telling me I needed to do that for a long time so that's what I'm gonna do and I'm gonna do a little intro on all of them. You see, I'd been kicking around the idea of doing reviews, I'd seen, The Nostalgia Critic and Angry Video Game Nerd, I'd seen them do it for a long time and a huge fan. And I'd never found a good reason or, the motivation to actually try it and then I had the idea to do the pop song reviews. And I'd been writing, reviews of songs in my blog – which is long gone by now, you can't find it – but I'd been doing reviews on my blog for a long time. And, I was scared of showing my face, then I had this great idea of this image of this silhouette guy sitting at his piano – he can play piano and I just loved the image of it so I couldn't stop myself from doing it. I was just so excited by it and this is the first episode, the humble, very humble beginning of Todd In The Shadows. This was so much harder than I thought it was gonna be and I'm not sure why I picked such an innocuous song to start off with – who's really bothered by "Down" by Jay Sean? And I started on it, I figured it would be easy, and I found out I couldn't figure out how to do anything: I didn't know how to act, I didn't know how to write, I didn't know how to edit, I didn't know how to film, I didn't know how to frame – I still don't know how much I've really learned about this since I've started but, eh, you had to start somewhere. I started with this for some reason. It's rough but it was a start, so – "Down" by Jay Sean, enjoy.
