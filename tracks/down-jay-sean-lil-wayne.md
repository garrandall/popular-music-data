What you really expect when I strut thru town,
2 or 3 days I'll shut you down,
Chillin' with the homie NO'SIDE,
You call, he that prince he rep 2 up 2 down,
Anyone I know get used to me,
I'm far from the man that I used to be,
And I don't ever really kick game,
I know you find it impressive
Whenever you introduced to me,
Cause I'm a good dude, take pride in that,
Need good lovin', I'm providin' that,
Understand that I'm worldwide,
You get it how you went it
Wherever you be residin' at,
Cause I do things from Spain back
Out to Texas, from the M town to the UK (to the U),
Where the girls all down
(Down, down, down)


So baby don't worry, you are my only,
You won't be lonely, even if the sky is falling down,
You'll be my only, no need to worry,
Baby are you down down down down down
Dooooooowwn, dooooooowwn,
Baby are you down down down down down
Dooooooowwn, dooooooowwn,
Even if the sky is falling down.


Don't stop get it get it,
Bout to jump all the way up in it,
Love the way you drop low and bend it,
Girl you killin' me wait a minute,
Love the way that you shake it up,
Too natural not to make it up,
Won't be long for we wakin' up (that's right),
I know you ain't used to havin'
Real fellas like me around (real),
I'm here to change your whole, life
Girl so you don't deal with clowns (no mo' clowns),
And treat like the superstar, that you are (uh huh),
Cause I'm a superstar too and I
Know exactly what I must do to make you feel...


Dooooooowwn, dooooooowwn,
Baby are you down down down down down
Dooooooowwn, dooooooowwn,
Even if the sky is falling down.


Just let it be, come on and bring your body next to me,
I'll take you away, hey, turn this
Place into our private getaway,
So leave it behind cause we have a night to get away,
So come on and fly with me as we make our great escape,


So baby don't worry, you are my only,
You won't be lonely, even if the sky is falling down,
You'll be my only, no need to worry,
Baby are you down down down down down
Dooooooowwn, dooooooowwn,
Baby are you down down down down down
Dooooooowwn, dooooooowwn,
Even if the sky is falling down.


Even if the sky is falling down like
She supposed to be,
She gets down low for me,
Down like her temperature, cause
To me she zero degree,
She's cold, overfreeze,
I got that girl from overseas,
Now she my Miss America,
Now can I be her soldier, please,
I'm fighting for this girl,
On a battlefield of love,
Don't it look like baby cupid sent
His arrows from above,
Don't you ever leave the side of me,
Indefinitely, not probably,
And honestly I'm down like economy,
Yeahhhhhh


Baby don't worry you are, my only,
You won't be lonely, even if the sky is falling down,
You'll be my only, no need to worry,
Baby are you down down down down down
Dooooooowwn, dooooooowwn,
Baby are you down down down down down
Dooooooowwn, dooooooowwn,
Even if the sky is falling down.
