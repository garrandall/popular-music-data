Corrine I want no opinion from you
Was it fun or just a bad thing to do
And while you play, I’m waiting for the day
I’ll find some way to make you pay


But then you come and you pull me around
(Drag my bad name down)
Would Jesus pull me around
(Drag my bad name down)
Would Jesus pull me around
(Drag my bad name down)
I need some food, some sleep
Some company to keep
The sun, some shade
A word and a will made


And drink, my cabinet’s open wide
I’ll take something to make me go wild
In truth, good fortune sets me free
Would vengeance make a killer of me


Pull me around
(Drag my bad name down)
Would Jesus pull me around
(Drag my bad name down)
Would Jesus pull me around
(Drag my bad name down)
I need some food, some sleep
Some company to keep
The sun, some shade
And somebody’s bed


Lull me around, drag my bad name down
And people say
Lull me around, drag my bad name down


Oh Jesus
(Drag my bad name down)
Would Jesus pull me around
(Drag my bad name down)
Would Jesus pull me around
(Drag my bad name down)
I’ll take some books, films, changing my will
A lies test, everybody
Jesus, pull me around
(Drag my bad name down)
Would Jesus pull me around
(Drag my bad name down)
Would Jesus pull me around
(Drag my bad name down)
