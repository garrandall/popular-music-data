Bon doo wah bon doo wah bon doo wah
Bon doo wah, baby I don't know

You're treating me like a plaything
You're treating me like a toy
That's why I call you a bon doo wah
It means you're a big bad boy (Hit it hard)


I give you lovin' (you give me nothin')
I give you kissin' (you keep on missin')


Well, you give me nothin' but trouble
You give me nothin' but shame
I'm gonna put you in misery
You're scandalizin' my name

(Everybody)


I give you lovin' (you give me nothin')
I give you kissin' (you keep on missin')


(Ease it now) Bon doo wah bon doo wah bon doo wah
Bon doo wah, say you'll love me so

(Hit it hard)
