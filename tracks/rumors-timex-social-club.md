Straight out the casket, rising up
Open up your eyes, can't you see me
What the fuck is this madness
Pick up my bones
Erase my name from off the tombstones
Alive and kicking
Breathin' the air
Call out my name punk
And I'll be there
No question
My suggestion to the action
Caught smack dab in the middle of the blastin'
Messin with me
You're messin' with the best
Bleow, you're takin' to shots to the chest

'Cause I'm back from the dead
Everlast's comin' back from the dead (Back from the dead)
You know I'm back from the dead
And I'll put a friggin' hole in your head
Back from the dead
Back from the dead

You can't disrespect it
I'm the resurrected
Back from the dead
Just to mess with your head
I'll stress what I said
But I won't repeat it
If you've got a cold, starve it
If you've got a fever, feed it
And if you can't feed it
Then why not blow
You might be positive
And not even know
I rock the hardcore
From the floor to the ceilin'
I give sexual healin'
I'll get your girlie squealin'
Like a pig
My grave's somethin' you can never dig
I'll rock a mausoleum
Backyard a colosseum

'Cause I'm back from the dead
Everlast's comin' back from the dead (Back from the dead)
You know I'm back from the dead
House of Pain's in effect, 'nuff said

Skip the autopsy
'Cause I never O.D.'d
I only puff boom kid
I never get skeed
I don't sniff or shoot up
Rip I'll stick my boot up
Your ass quick fast
Everlast don't jive
Just like Pearl Jam
I'm still Alive 
Spreadin' like tumors
Gossip and lies
Exaggerated reports of my demise
And if you believed 'em
Well then you got gassed
The media deceived em'
Just like in the past

'Cause I'm back from the dead
Everlast's comin' back from the dead (Back from the dead)
You know I'm back from the dead
And I'll put a friggin' hole in your head
Back from the dead
Back from the dead

Like Steven Seagal
I'm hard to kill
And like G.G. Allen
I'm crazy ill
I'll beat ya down with my mic
Kick your ass with my Nike
Bust ya in the eye
If ya tell another lie
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Thinkin' I'm dead
You must be smokin' dust
Come see me bust in the flesh
It's a must

'Cause I'm back from the dead
Everlast's comin' back from the dead (Back from the dead)
You know I'm back from the dead
House of Pain's in effect, 'nuff said
Back from the dead
