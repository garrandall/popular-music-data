As I bask in the glow of a just-lit fire
Feeling the warmth as the flame grows higher
I think it's true that nothing is really new under the sun
Watching a new love grow from old love's embers
Yesterday's gone but today remembers
Doesn't it seem to come down the same for everyone

Only love is real
Everything else illusion
Adding to the confusion of the way we connive
At being alive
Tracing a line till we can define
The thing that allows us to feel
Only love is real

Childhood dreams like muddy waters
Flowing through me to my son and daughters
Everything I ever thought is confirmed as truth to me
Even as I see the way that I want to go now
Still I wish I had known what I know now
Maybe I could have spared you giving your youth to me

Only love is real
Everything else illusion
Adding to the confusion of the way we contrive
To just stay alive
Tracing a line till we can define
The thing that allows us to feel
Only love is real
