I'm just a boy who's so in love
I've got a girl from up above
She's fine, she's mine
Oh, oh, oh, that's
The story of my love
That's the story of my love

Nobody loves her the way I do
She has made my dreams come true
I won't forget the day we met
Oh, oh, oh, that's
The story of my love
That's the story of my love

Her eyes are as
Warm as the sun above
Her lips, they are
Always wanting my love
I'll always love her
Yes, I'll always try
For her, for her, I'd even die

For her, for her
I'd do anything
That is why my heart sings
I won't forget, the day we met
Oh, oh, oh, that's
The story of my love
That's the story of my love

Her eyes are as
Warm as the sun above
Her lips, they are
Always wanting my love
I'll always love her
Yes, I'll always try
For her, for her, I'd even die

For her, for her
I'd do anything
That is why my heart sings
I won't forget, the day we met
Oh, oh, oh, that's
The story of my love
That's the story of my love

That's the story of my love
That's the story of my love
