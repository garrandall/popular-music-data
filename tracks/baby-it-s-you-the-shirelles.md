Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la

It's not the way you smile that touched my heart. (sha la la la la)
It's not the way you kiss that tears me apart.

Uh, oh, many, many, many nights go by,
I sit alone at home and I cry over you.
What can I do.
Can't help myself, 'cause baby, it's you.
Baby, it's you.

You should hear what they say about you, "cheat," "cheat."
They say, they say you never never never ever been true. (cheat cheat)

Uh oh,
It doesn't matter what they say,
I know I'm gonna love you any old way.
What can I do, and it's true.
Don't want nobody, nobody, 'cause baby, it's you. (sha la la la la la la)
Baby, it's you. (sha la la la la la la)

Uh oh,
It doesn't matter what they say,
I know I'm gonna love you any old way.
What can I do, when it's true.
Don't want nobody, nobody, 'cause baby, it's you. (sha la la la la la la)
Baby, it's you. (sha la la la la la la)
Don't leave me all alone...
