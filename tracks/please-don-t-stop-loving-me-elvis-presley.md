Please don't stop loving me
You were born just to be in my arms
In my arms
Please don't stop loving me
Your lips were made just to be kissed by me
Kissed by me


When I'm with you
I don't know day from night, wrong from right
You are my world, that's all I know
I love you so, I won't let go


Please don't stop loving me
Darling you'll always be mine alone
Mine alone
