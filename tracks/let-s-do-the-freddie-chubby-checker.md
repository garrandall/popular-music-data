Are you ready, Let's do the Freddie
Are you ready, Gonna do the Freddie
Oooo Oooo Oooo Ooo
Do the Freddie
Oh Oh Oh Oh
There's a dance that crossin' the nation
Causin' more than a great sensation
You flip your wings just like a bird
I know it sounds crazy
But you gotta take my word
You wave your hands up to the sky
Kick your legs out to the side
Are you ready, Let's do the Freddie
Are you ready, we're gonna do the Freddie
Better do the dance every day or night
If you wanna learn to do it right
It's good to  the second hop around
Your heart starts poundin' like it's upside down
Are you ready, Let's do the Freddie
Are you ready, we're gonna do the Freddie
Ar mums and brothers, sisters and ya daddio
Soon as you learn the Freddie
Other dances gotta go oh oh

Do it in your house and down at school
Do it with the hippies and with the fools
Do this dance every day and night
If you wanna learn to do it right
You gotta wave your hands up to the sky
Kick your legs out to the side
Are you ready, Let's do the Freddie
Are you ready, get ready Freddie
Kick your legs out to the side
Gonna do the Freddie
Kick your legs up high
Gonna do the Freddie
