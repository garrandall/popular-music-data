Yeah... yeah... yeah... yeah... yeah... yeah... yeah... yeah.
Yeah, the dream team
Holiday, k-young, YB
Let's get this money


Can't nobody put it on yo boy like you
Cause can't nobody make me make noise like you
Never knew I could feel so good 'til I met you (until I met you)
I wanna be
All over your body babe
All over your body babe
All over your body baaby
All over your body babe
All over your body babe
All over your body baaby yeah
Pleasure P talk to em go!


Aaahhh! this patron got me feeling nice (so good)
Tonight must be your lucky night (why's that?)
Cause I'm a put my tounge on ya
Like ya man's supposed to (so I let her lick the rapper)

The way you tasting me, make me wanna fall in love...
I'm just playin'
Now that I gave you this business, I got you hot and addicted
Now that I gave you this business, I got you hot and addicted (twista let's go!)


Now I love how you be gettin on top of me, rockin me, I be slappin but you tellin me you ain't had enough yet
Hit you with a subject and a predicate now tell me do you want it delicate or do you like rough sex
Beat it up ubberly making an ugly face, I'm utterly killin em while I'm sippin on patron (patron)
Yung berg told me he don't be rockin it but even though she was jockin the rocker for fatone
So I'm a hook him up with a redbone, cause I know he the one to get his head gone
But if you think that he don't be feelin them nubia queens then I'm a have to let you know you dead wrong
Kamikaze with a black mazaratti I let you know that you ain't ever met a man like me (me... me... me... me... me)
Twista and berg, now tell 'em what we talking about


Give me the business (you give me the business)
This is the remix (this is the remix baby)
Shawty give me the business
Now that you know exactly what I wanna do (wanna do)
Then I'm a give this remix to you


You can say that I don't like 'em but I tasted and I like it (she's my dark skin, my dark skin)
You can say that I don't like 'em but I tasted and I like it (she's my wanna get it, my wanna get it)

Tell me


Is it chu, is it chu
Said I really wanna love you baby
I wanna get that pussy wet, I wanna beat it, let me eat it, I wanna put you in that new mercedes
Cause she my girlfriend, so I call her mi vida
And she know that I love her, cause I tell her I need her
I beat that pussy up, I mean I put it down
Just when you think it's over, I spin you back around
I leave you feeling high, your feet won't touch the ground
She said to come on over, she want the business now


East side thing I'm breezing through
Pulled over I was beasting too
Like hey lil mama let me speak to you
I, almost crashed when I seen the jewel
Hoped out of my vehicle
All black, fila too
Like baby girl what's the deal with chu, she was in new york from the 312
Lil chi town mama, in new york, you in in my town mama
To tell you the truth tryna get you loose so you can jump in the ride and we can fly around mama
You can tell she about her business cause her neck look like a blizzard
Try to get em in, but she was so conceited, so I had to think a lil bit more strategic


Give me the business (you give me the business)
This is the remix (this is the remix)
Shawty give me the business (this is the remix)
Now that you know exactly what I wanna do
Then I'm a give this remix to you


See I ain't never met a girl that keep it juicy like you... you... youuuu
And I ain't never met a girl that can seduce me like you... you... youuuu

Give it to me baby I...
I like it... I like it... I love it... I love it... come get it... come get it... you want it... you want it... I like it...
I like it... I love it... I love it... come get it... come get it... cause she want it (the business)


I love all flavors
How many licks do it take for me to get to the center of that business baby (first lady)
It's real talk (casha)
And it's going out to my girl
It's to you, it's to you, it's to you, it's to you (baby),
It's to you, it's to you, it's to you (said it's to you baby),
It's to you, it's to you (yeah it's to you baby)
It's to you, it's to you (album in stores), it's to you

The Business
