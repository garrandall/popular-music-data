Ah
Oh baby
Oh baby, keep on
My baby, keep on doing it
Right on, uh uh uh
Right on doing it
You got it together, baby keep on
Oh, you got it together baby, right on
Keep on doing it, gotta get it baby, oh gotta get it
Um huh
My my baby, keep on
I swear you got it together baby
Keep on, keep on

Whatever, whatever
Girllll, I'll do it
Forever and ever, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll see you through it

I've got to keep you pleased in every way I can
Gonna give you all of me as much as you can stand
Make love to you right now, that's all I want to do
I know you need it, girl, and you know I need it, too

'Cause I found what the world is searching for
Here, right here, my dear
I don't have to look no more
And, oh, my babe
I hoped and I prayed for someone
Just like you to make me feel the way you do

Never, never gonna give you up
I'm never, ever gonna stop
Not the way I feel about you
Girl, I just can't live without you
I'm never ever gonna quit 'cause
Quittin' just ain't my shtick
I'm gonna stay right here with you
And do all the things you want me to

Whatever you want
Girllll, you got it
And whatever you need
I don't want to see you without it

You've given me much more than words could ever say
And oh, my dear, I'll be right here until my dying day
I don't know just how to say all the things I feel
I just know that I love you so and it gives me such a thrill

'Cause I found what this world is searching for
Here, right here, my dear
I don't have to look no more
And all of my days
I hoped and I prayed
For someone just like you to make me feel the way you do

I'm never, never gonna give you up
I'm never, ever gonna stop
Stop the way I feel about you
Girl, I just can't live without you
I'm never ever gonna quit 'cause
Quittin' just ain't my shtick
Gonna stay right here with you
Do all the things you want me to

Whoa, I never gonna give you up
I'm never, ever gonna stop
All the things I feel about you
Girl, I just can't live without you
I'm never ever gonna quit 'cause
Quittin' just ain't my shtick
I'm gonna stay right here with you
And do all the things you want me to
