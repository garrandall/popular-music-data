There's not another smile in the world like that
The way your eyes light up when you smile...
Baby, I'm really in the mood for love
You have a way of, huh... just looking at me, and
Baby, I start to feel this urge to surge, of... of love inside of me
I wanna make love to you
Baby, I wanna make love with you
Ohh... come here, mmhm, give me your hand, touch me right here

Don't let go...
Baby, tonight we're gonna get
Closer, much closer...

Let me show you the feeling, girl
Over and over... tonight

I'm really feeling, not like ever before
Oh, don't let go
Just come and hold me forever
I love you so
Please don't stop, girl
Never, no ever
Tonight I'm feeling, unlike ever before

Oh, don't let go
You make love so tender, I surrender
Baby, let's come together
Forever and ever

Tonight, we're going to feel it
Unlike ever before

I will give my heart
I will share my soul, yes I will babe
If your love is real
Only if it's what you feel
If it's what you feel
Oh baby, oh baby
Ah, ah, ah

I will give my heart
I will share my soul
I wanna be with you babe, oh lord
If your love is real
Only if it's wha-ya-ya-at you feel
If it's what you feel
Oh darling

Don't you ever stop!
No, baby
What you do, do, do to me
No, don't you ever stop!
Don't you do it

Don't you ever stop! (ever stop)
(Don't you ever stop!) Never, ever, ever! Never
(Don't you ever stop!) Never, ever
Stop, stop, stop
