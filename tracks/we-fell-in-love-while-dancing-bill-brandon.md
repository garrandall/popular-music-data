I was looking for a place to go
To forget about someone I used to know
Where the music was playing loud
Started dancing with the memories
Among the crowd

And there she was
Dancing by herself
Digging on the music while
Looking for someone else

At the time
We were doing the perfect dance
When she took me surprise
And asked me to be her disco man
Well, we fell in love while dancing
It was just like magic
When we hit the floor

Well, well
We fell in love while dancing
This music of love made me
Want her so much more

We fell in love while dancing
We never thought
We'd ever see each other again, no
We fell in love while dancing
Hey, we romanced while we danced at the disco

Alright, yeah, wooo
Alright, yeah, well
Hey, hey, hey, yeah

Now every night
We`re on the scene
Down at the disco
Where the lovers meet

Just to hear our favorite song
That brought us together, yeah
Where we belong

I know the music
Won`t let this love die
There`s feeling in our heart
If we let it 

Please, Mr. DJ
Keep on playing that song
While I tell her again
I've got to be her disco man
Well, we fell in love while dancing
It was just like magic
When we hit the floor

Well, well
We fell in love while dancing
This music of love made me want her so much more
We fell in love while dancing
We never thought we'd ever see each other again, no

We fell in love while dancing
Hey, we romanced
While we danced at the disco

Alright, oooh, well
Hey, hey, hey, yeah

We fell in love while dancing
It was just like magic
When we hit the floor

Don't you know
We fell in love while dancing
This music of love made me
Want her so much more

We fell in love while dancing
We never thought we'd ever
See each other again, hey

We fell in love while dancing
Girl, you put your spell on me
Look what you`re doing to me

(We fell in love while dancing)
(We fell in love while dancing)

We fell in love while dancing
This music of love made me
Want her so much more

We fell in love while dancing
We never thought we'd ever see each other again, no
We fell in love while dancing
Hey, we romanced while we danced at the disco
