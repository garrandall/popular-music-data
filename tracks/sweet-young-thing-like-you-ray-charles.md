Sweet (sweet) young thing
Like you (like you, baby)
You've gone and made me
Lose my cool

Sweet (sweet) young thing
Like you (like you, baby)
You're all I need
To see me through

I said I'd never love again
I've always been on the losing end

When you touched my hand
I knew right there and then
I loved you, I loved you, baby
I love you

(Sweet) sweet young thing
Like you (like you, baby)
You've gone and made me
Lose my cool

Sweet (sweet) young thing
Like you (like you, baby)
Yeah, babe, you're all I need
To see me through

My whole life was upside down
Misery and heartbreak
Followed me around

Things that used to make me sad
Have got a brand new sound
I love you, I love you, baby
I love you

Sweet (sweet) young thing
Like you (like you, baby)
You've gone and made me
Lose my cool

Sweet (sweet) young thing
Like you (like you, baby)
You're all I need
To see me through
