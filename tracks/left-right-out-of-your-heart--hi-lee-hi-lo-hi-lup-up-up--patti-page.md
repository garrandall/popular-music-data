Hi-lee Hi-lo Hi-lup up - up
Hi-lee Hi-lo Hi-left!
Hi-lee Hi-lo Hi-lup up - up
Hi-lee Hi-lo Hi-left!

Oh, I was left (left), right (right)
Out of your arms
Oh, I was left (left), right (right)
Out of your charms
My heart said yes, right (right)
Right from the start
Now I am left, right (right, left)
Out of your heart

Oh, you were such a cute Marine
I really was impressed
You said of all the girls you knew
That you liked me the best
I gave you all my kisses
Surrendered all my charms
But time revealed, you played the field
And I was...left...

Oh, I was left (left), right (right)
Out of your arms
Oh, I was left (left), right (right)
Out of your charms
My heart said yes, right (right)
Right from the start
Now I am left, right (right, left)
Out of your heart

You said you'd look me up, up, up
When you got back to town
But when you hit the city
All you did was look around
I caught you with a red-head
And, baby, tho' you said
You're merely warmin'up for me
I figure I was...left...

Oh, I was left (left), right (right)
Out of your arms
Oh, I was left (left), right (right)
Out of your charms
My heart said yes, right (right)
Right from the start
Now I am left, right (right, left)
Out of your heart

You called me on the telephone
And said: "Suzie dear
You're bein' mighty silly
In believin' all you hear
You know I love you only
So Suzie save your breath"
But, since my name is Cindy Lou
I know that I was...left...

Oh, I was left (left), right (right)
Out of your arms
Oh, I was left (left), right (right)
Out of your charms
My heart said yes, right (right)
Right from the start
Now I am left, right (right, left)
Out of your heart
