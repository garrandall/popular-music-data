Can't get no rest
Don't know how I work all day
When will I learn?
Memories get in the way

I walk around
I can't hear a sound
Folks talkin' loud
But I don't see at all
I gotta get away, gotta get away

I don't know where to go
It's hopeless so
I guess I'll leave it alone

Well, I spent all the day
Fixin' up to go somewhere
Thought I was late
And I found she wasn't there

I guess I'll find
The love, peace of mind, some other time
But I still have today
I gotta get away, gotta get away

I don't know where to go
It's hopeless so
I guess I'll leave it alone

Games people play
Night or day
They're just not matchin'
What they should do
Keeps me feelin' blue

Been down too long
Right, wrong
I just can't stop it
Spendin' all day
Thinking just of you

12: 45
Headed for the subway home
I took my time
'Cause I felt so all alone

Not far away
I heard a funny sound, took a look around
And I could see her face
Smilin' as she came
Callin' out my name

So I know where to go
We'll take it slow
Guess I'll call it a day

Games people play
Night or day
They're just not matchin'
What they should do
Keeps me feelin' blue

Been down too long
Right, wrong
I just can't stop it
Spendin' all day
Thinking just of you

Games people play
Night or day
They're just not matchin'
What they should do
Keeps me feelin' blue
