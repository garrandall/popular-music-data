Some people stay all alone and hide
They don't even want to know the reason why
They've given up on finding someone new
But new love comes, it's going to come for you
When true love comes, it's going to comfort you
Now you say you've got a broken heart
You ought to know this side of love can leave you torn apart
Dry your eyes because your heart's gonna mend
And maybe tonight you'll fall in love again
Yeah, maybe tonight you'l fall in love again


But I know, I know that you're down on love
But you're wrong, so wrong
To be down on love


Now love seems so far away
Your skies are so cloudy
And the tears come like falling rain
Face up to it and don't pretend
And maybe tonight you'll fall in love again
Yeah, maybe tonight you'll fall in love again
Just once in a life you'll realize
When love takes two, only one heart cries

In matters of the heart
You better know before you start
You can't get down on love
So always be prepared
To be alone and a little scared
But never down on love


You see you can't stay down forever, girl
Down on love
Come on, now
Don't get down on love
This ain't right baby, no
Down on love
Don't you go through life living down on love
Down on love
Don't you go through life living down on love
Down on love
Don't you go through life down on love
Down on love
