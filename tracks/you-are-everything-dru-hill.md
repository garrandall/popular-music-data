Yo we gonna try somethin a little different
Yo make make my voice a little more distorted
Yeah I don't know if they ready for this
(Yeah yeah)
Uh uh bass
(Yeah)
Uh uh bass
(Yeah)
Uh uh bass
(Yeah oh yeah yeah)
Uh uh verse 

Last night we had an argument
Afterwards I'm feelin pretty bent mmm
Then I took a drink
And I didn't think
That was the storm for me


You don't know you don't know how she'll take it
Tell me what is a good man to do
Will she cherish your heart will she break it
Cuz you are everything and everything is you
Sing


You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you

Listen
Baby tell me are you playin me
When you're lovin me
When you're holdin me
And when you're fuckin me
Are you playin me
Playin me playin me
You are everything to me
I'm wonderin if you will see
That I will love you always





Break it down
(You are...)


Uh yeah
It's Ja Rule
And Dru Hill nigga

Baby girl you tellin lies
Cuz when I look at you in your face
I can see I'm on your mind
And it don't matter what them hoes may say
I know your love is blind for me
Every bitch needs a thug nigga in their life
Truly could it be could it be you enjoy me fuckin you
While you be lovin me
Trick and destroy us mentally
That's why they freak wit me frequently
Love is life


Naw nigga life is love
Take the baddest bitch ice her up
After tour tell her to keep in touch


Nigga that's what's up


Bein Nokio's a bit much
Got bitches overseas that love to fuck
Got bitches in the states that love to suck
What the fuck y'all want from me
Ghetto celebrity from B-More


Murdera do or die from the NY


Now everybody get it right


N-O-K-I-O baby


R to U to L-E baby
Know a lot of y'all bitches hate me
Cuz ya can't relate to me
What the fuck you want from me


Let them hoes know not a thing
Ice her wrist neck ear and rings cuz you know


You are everything



You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you
Stop
