She's the girl of my dreams
She's the girl on my mind
She's used to play me for the fool
'Cause she's the hurting kind

I lost my heart in the East
Another part in the West
You better jump back, baby
You're the girl I love the best

I'm gonna ride the wind
There's nothing I won't do
I'm coming up real fast
I got my eyes on you

See you're eyes of love
Well tell me what you see
I see your long black hair
Moving over me, yeah
Oh yes, I feel good now now

Let's talk about love
Let's talk about love
Let's talk about love
Let's talk about it

Alright, alright, alright, I got my eyes on you
Alright, alright, alright, I got my eyes on you, yeah

With my heart over here
Another part over there
I still got pretty love
And baby, I don't care

Oh, let's talk about love
Let's talk about love
Let's talk about love

Alright, alright, alright, I got my eyes on you
Alright, alright, alright, I got my eyes on you
Yeah, oh, oh, let's talk about it, aah

Don't blame me
Oh, won't hurt you
Don't blame me
It's plain to see you know that it'll be yeah, oh, oooooh

Aah, aah, aah

She's the girl of my dreams
She's the girl on my mind
She's used to play me for the fool
The hurting kind

Gonna 'round the world Nothing I won't do
Coming up real fast I got my eyes on you

Alright, alright, alright, I got my eyes on you
Alright, alright, alright, I got my eyes on you
Alright, alright, alright, I got my eyes on you
Alright, alright, alright, I got my eyes on you
Alright, alright, alright, I got my eyes on you
Alright, alright, alright, I got my eyes on you Oooh!
Alright, alright, alright, I got my eyes on you
Alright, alright, alright, I got my eyes on you
