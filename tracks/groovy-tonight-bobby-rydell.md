(It's gonna be groovy tonight)

Oh, one night, you kiss
And then the night next, you're mine
And then sometimes you won't
Oh, you better be groovy tonight

Oh, what's wrong with you
Start acting right
'Cause if you don't
You're gonna lose me tonight

You're breaking my wagon
Just zigging and zagging
But, baby, I'm a getting wise

Yeah, you think you're great
But just you wait
I'm gonna cut you down to size

L'amour du jour
Let's dim the lights
You can be sure
It's gonna be groovy tonight

La la la la la...
You better believe it tonight

La la la la la...
Sing it, yeah
La la la la la...
You better be groovy tonight

You're breaking my wagon
With your zigging and zagging
But, baby, I'm a getting wise

Oh, you think you're great
But just you wait
I'm gonna cut you down to size

I love you so and I don't
Don't, don't wanna fight
Hey, baby, let's go
It's gonna be groovy tonight

L'amour du jour, right now
Let's dim the lights
You can be sure
It's gonna be groovy tonight
We're gonna be groovy too
