Going down the river John
Going to ask to save my soul
Going down the river John
Going to ask to save my soul
Going to get down on my knees
And there I'm gonna freeze
Going down the river
To save my soul

When moses opened up the waters
And he let the people through
Well now, moses opened up the waters
And he let the people through
Was a windy day and bearly drown
When the waters came dummlin' down
Came down to the rive to save my soul

Well, save my soul, save my soul
Save my soul, save my soul
Came down to the river, yaaa
To save my soul
(To save my soul)

Now listen brother Henry
Listen here to me
Forget about your jezabelle
And come, come, come to me
We'll go down to the river
We'll get down on our knees
And ask the Lord to save our souls
Save us if you please

Well, save my soul, save my soul
Save my soul, save my soul
Came down to the river, yaaa
To save my soul
(To save my soul)

Save my soul, save my soul
Save my soul, save my soul...
