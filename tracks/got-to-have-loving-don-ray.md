It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more love
It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more love
It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more love
It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more love
It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more lovin'
It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more lovin'

Inside this world there's lots of casul lovers
Unselfish lovin' they leave to the others
They got to have it
They can't do without it
But ain't just a shame the way that they go about it


For your information
We need more loving
To help the situation
Got to have lovin'
To keep the world together
We need more loving
We got to stick together
Got to have lovin'
We got to (got to)
Need to (Have it)
Have lots more lovin'
We need to (Have it)
Go to (Have it)
Lots more lovin'
It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more love
It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more love
It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more lovin'
It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more lovin'

And in this world you find the kind that would please you
One day they love you, the next day they leave you
They love to be loved, but seldom return it
They're using up a good thing and they just don't deserve it



It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more love
It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more love
It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more love
It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more love
It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more lovin'
It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more lovin'
It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more lovin'
It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more lovin'

A world so big can make a person feel lonely
You got no money, your clothes may be homely
It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more lovin'
It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more lovin'
But if your pockets light as a feather
Just wrap yourself in lovin' and you'll feel a lot better
It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more lovin'
It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more lovin'
It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more
