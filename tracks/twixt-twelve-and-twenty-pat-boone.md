They say the years twixt twelve and twenty
Are the years of confusion and doubt
We all have fears twixt twelve and twenty
But through love we'll learn what life is all about

Are we old enough to feel such deep devotion?
Don't they know love is ageless when it's true?

There'll be no tears twixt twelve and twenty
If you just have faith and trust in my love for you

There'll be no tears twixt twelve and twenty
If you just have faith and trust in my love for you
