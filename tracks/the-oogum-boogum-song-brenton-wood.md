Oogum oogum boogum boogum
boogum now baby you're castin' your spell on me
A-I say, "Oogum oogum boogum boogum
boogum now baby you're castin' you're spell on me"

You got me doin' funny things like a clown
A-just look at me

When you wear your high heeled boots with your hip hugger suit, huh
its all right, you're outta sight
and you wear that cute mini skirt with your brother's sloppy shirt, huh
A-I admit it, girl that I can dig it

Well then I say
Oogum oogum boogum boogum
boogum now baby you're castin' your spell on me
A-I say, "Oogum oogum boogum boogum
boogum now baby you're castin' your spell on me"

You got me doin' funny things like a clown
A-just look at me

When you wear your bell bottom pants
I just stand there in a trance, huh
I can't move, you're in the groove
would you believe little girl that I am crazy 'bout you, huh
now go on with your bad self

(Oh)

Oh, oh my my my baby's got these spells on me
Oh, oh oohow mercy, mercy on me
Huh, all right

When you wear those big earrings, long hair, and things
you got style, girl, that sure is wild
and you wear that cute trench coat and you're standin' and posin'
you got soul, you got too much soul

I just say who got the blues say who got the blues
say who got the blues now castin' your spell on me
Well I say, "Who got the blues say who got the blues..."
