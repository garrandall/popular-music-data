She's got something that moves my soul
And she knows 
I'd love to love her
But she lets me down every time
Can't make her mine
She's no one's lover

Tonight with me she'll be so inviting
I want her all for myself

Oh, temptation eyes
Looking through my, my, my soul
Temptation eyes
You've got to love me, got to love me tonight

Got to love me, baby, yeah, mmm

Her wild-eyed innocence is just a game
But just the same
My head is spinning
She's got a way to keep me on her side
It's just a ride
It's never-ending

Tonight with me she'll be so exciting
I want her all for myself

Oh, temptation eyes
Looking through my, my, my soul
Temptation eyes
You've got to love me, got to love me tonight

Do you feel it now?

Tonight with me she'll be so exciting
I want her all for myself

Oh, temptation eyes
Looking through my, my, my soul
Temptation eyes
You've got to love me, got to love me tonight

Temptation eyes
Looking through my, my, my soul
Temptation eyes
You're gonna love me, love me tonight

Temptation eyes
