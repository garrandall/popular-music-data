Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Shall I stay
Or would it be a sin
For I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darlin' so it goes
Something's are meant to be
Take my hand
And take my whole life too
For I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darlin' so it goes
Something's were meant to be
Wise men say
That only fools rush in
But I can't help
Falling in love with you
Oh now
That I can't help
Falling in love with you
Falling in love with you
With you
