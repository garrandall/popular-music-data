Usher
Yeah man


So we back in the club
With the bodies rocking from side to side (side to side)
Thank God the week is done
I feel like a zombie gone back to life (back to life)

Hands up, and suddenly we all got our hands up
No control of my body
Ain't I seen you before?
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes

'Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah, baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again

So dance, dance, like it's the last, last night of your life, life
Gonna get you right
'Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again

Keep downing drinks like there's no tomorrow
There's just right now, now, now, now, now, now
Gonna set the roof on fire
Gonna burn this motherfucker down, down, down, down, down, down

Hands up, when the music drops
We both put our hands up
Put your hands on my body
Swear I seen you before
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes

'Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah, baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again

So dance, dance, like it's the last, last night of your life, life
Gonna get you right
'Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again


Usher, don't lie
Hear no evil, or speak no evil, or see no evil
Get it, baby, hope you catch it like T.O.,
That's how we roll
My life is a movie, and you just tivo

Honey got me swishin' like a dreadlock
She won't wrestle, but I got her in a headlock
Yabba dabba doo, make her bed rock
Mami on fire, psh, red hot

Bada bing, bada boom
Mr. Worldwide as I step in the room
I'm a hustler, baby, but that you knew
And tonight it's just me and you, dale

'Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again
Mr. Worldwide, heh, let's take over the world
Yeah, baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in loveâdale, let goâfalling in love

So dance, dance, like it's the last, last night of your life, life
Gonna get you right
(Come on, come on)
'Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah, baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again
(Put your hands up, put your hands up)

So dance, dance, like it's the last, last night of your life, life
Gonna get you right
'Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again

Yeah, thank you DJ
