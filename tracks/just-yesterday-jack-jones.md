Can you remember back when you were young?
When all the simple things you did were so much fun

You got lost somewhere along the way
You've forgotten how to play, every single day

Am I right?

I remember back when I was just a boy
I got a gun and holster for a Christmas toy

Pretending to be a cowboy was the very best
âCause I was always the fastest gun in all the West

Iâd play
Play
Remember like it was yesterday
I was young and having fun 
Playing all my cares away


Play, play, remember and you will see

The world is so mysterious and wild
When you start to see it through the eyes of a child


Mr. Cromer. Surely you must have a childhood memory...?


There's a memory that I could share
Of flying down the banister of our old stairs

Only for a moment, I was in mid-air
And for that moment I, I really felt like I could fly


The moment that my father told me of the fable
I wanted to be a knight of the King's Round Table

A saucepan on my hand and a spoon for a sword
Iâd venture and prevail, returning with the holy grail and...


Play, play
Imagine like it was yesterday
We were young and having fun 
Playing all our cares away

Play, play
Remember and you will see
The world is so mysterious and wild
When you start to see it through the eyes of a child


Miss Bassett!


I used to dream I was a ballerina


And I was a gladiator in a large arena


I used to dream Prince Charming would one day be mine


It would seem you've had an imagination all this time!


Play, play
Imagine like it was yesterday
We were young and having fun 
Playing all our cares away

Play, play
Remember and you will see
The world is so mysterious and wild
When you start to see it through the eyes of a child


Georgie porgie, puddinâ pie,
Kissed the girls and made them cry
When the boys came out to play
Georgie Porgie ran away!


Iâve got one! Iâve got one!

Jack be nimble, Jack be quick!
Jack jumped over the candle stick


Mary, Mary quite contrary
How does your garden grow?


Old King Cole was a merry old soul
And a merry old soul was he


Hickory dickory dock
The mouse ran up the clock
The clock struck one...
Old Mother Hubbard!
Peas pudding hot!
Three blind mice!
Jack Sprat could eat no fat

Na na na na na na na...
We all fall...


Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall
Humpy Dumpty had a great fall
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put Humpty together again


One, two, buckle my shoe!
Three, four, shut the door!
Five, six, pick up the sticks!
Woah, woah, here we go!

Sing a song of six pence
A pocket full of rye
Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie

London bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down
London bridge is falling down
Oh!

Play, play
Imagine like it was yesterday
We were young and having fun 
Playing all our cares away

Play, play
Remember and you will see
The world is so mysterious and wild
When you start to see it through the eyes of a...

Ring-a-ring-a rosey
A pocket full of posey
A tissue, a tissue
We all fall down!
