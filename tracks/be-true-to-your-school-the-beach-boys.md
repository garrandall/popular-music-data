When some loud braggart tries to put me down
And says his school is great
I tell him right away
"Now what's the matter buddy
Ain't you heard of my school
It's number one in the state"


So be true to your school now
Just like you would to your girl or guy
Be true to your school now
And let your colors fly
Be true to your school


I got a letterman's sweater
With a letter in front
I got for football and track
I'm proud to wear it now
When I cruise around
The other parts of the town
I got a decal in back


So be true to your school now
Just like you would to your girl or guy
Be true to your school now
Let your colors fly
Be true to your school


On Friday we'll be jacked up on the football game
And I'll be ready to fight
We're gonna smash 'em now
My girl will be working on her pom-poms now
And she'll be yelling tonight


So be true to your school now
Just like you would to your girl or guy
Be true to your school now
Let your colors fly
Be true to your school


Rah rah rah Be true to your school
Rah rah rah Be true to your school
Rah rah rah Be true to your school
Rah rah rah Be true to your school
Rah rah rah Be true to your school
