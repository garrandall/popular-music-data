Can you love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man

When I'm with my friends
And the man talk begins
And they brag about all the love they've known
I sit in the corner all alone
The best thing I can do is listen
The most I've done is just some kissin'

Can you love a virgin man (baby)
Can you love (really love) a virgin man

How come people say
Lady virgin that's OK
But when the conversation turns around
Virgin man they always put him down
People say he must be "funny"
He ain't had a taste of honey

Can you love a virgin man (baby)
Can you love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man

My gift of love has never been unwrapped
My well of love it still remains untapped (oh baby)

Can you love a virgin man (baby)
Can you love (really love) a virgin man
Can you (really) love a virgin man (baby)

How come people say
Lady virgin that's OK
But a man who is a man
Ain't supposed to be that way
No no no no no no

Can you love a virgin man (baby)
Can you love a virgin man
(Wonder what my friends would do if they only knew)
Can you love a virgin man
(I've been saving all my love for you, you)
Can you love a virgin man

They say making love's an art
In which each man should take part
By the time he reaches twenty one
Making love is something that he should have done
It ain't like I've never wanted to
But it's easier to think than it is to do

Can you (really) love a virgin man (baby)
Can you (really) love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man
