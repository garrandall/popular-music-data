Twenty long miles from town
My old car broke down
The clutch is shot
And the sound is so hot
Oh, what I'd give to be home

Nineteen miles from town
My old car broke down
The battery's dead
Man, like I said
Oh, what I'd give to be home

Eighteen miles from town
My old car broke down
The fan belt's slipping
And the engine's missing
Oh, what I'd give to be home
Resting my bones

Seventeen miles from town
My old car broke down
Just my luck, I've got
The fuel pump's stuck
Oh, what I'd give to be home

When the sun's
So high up in the sky
And I'm trying to
Get home to my baby

When I get that far
I'm gonna get rid of this car
It's got to go, it's got to go
And I don't mean maybe

Sixteen miles from town
My old short broke down
My tire's down and no spare around
Oh, what I'd give to be home
Oh yeah

Fifteen miles from town
My old car broke down
The battery's dead
Man, like I said
Oh, what I'd give to be home

Fourteen miles from town
My old car broke down
