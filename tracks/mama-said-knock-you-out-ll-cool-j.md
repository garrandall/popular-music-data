Don't call it a comeback
I been here for years
Rocking my peers
Putting suckers in fear
Making the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go bomb
Explosion, overpowering
Over the competition, we're towering
Record? Shock
When I drop these lyrics that'll make you call them cops (what)
Don't you dare stare,
You better move (move)
Don't ever compare us
To the rest that are all get sliced and diced
Competition paying our price


I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out


Shadowboxing when I heard you on the radio
I just don't know
What made you forget that I was raw?
But now I got a new toy
I'm going insane, starting a hurricane releasing pain
Letting you know you can't gain or maintain
Unless you say my name
Rippin', killin', diggin' and drillin' a hole
Past your soul





Mama said knock you out
