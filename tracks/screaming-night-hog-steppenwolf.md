Out on my Night Hog somebody temptin'
Hear it scream on by your house
The highway sign is my only call
Cause a demon deep inside keeps driving me to roam

Well I'm nobody's slave, I'm nobody's master
Time is mine, morning, night and afternoon
And you hitch-hiking woman, when you see me coming
Jump on my back and let your hair come tumbling down

I'm going downtown to see my lady
I'm going downtown to tell her goodbye
I won't hang around, it's driving me crazy
I'll be out of town 'til the chilly winds start to blow

Out on my Night Hog somebody temptin'
Hear it scream on by your house
My rolling hog will hunt the night
And chase the road until it's time to strike

Well I'm nobody's slave, I'm nobody's master
Time is mine, morning, night and afternoon
And you hitch-hiking woman, when you see me coming
Jump on my back and let your hair come tumbling down
