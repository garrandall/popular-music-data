You got me running, going out of my mind
You got me thinking that I'm wasting my time


Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down


You wanna stay out with your fancy friends
I'm telling you, it's got to be the end


Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down


Don't bring me down, Groos
Don't bring me down, Groos
Don't bring me down, Groos
Don't bring me down


What happened to the girl I used to know?
You let your mind out somewhere down the road


Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down


You're always talking 'bout your crazy nights
One of these days, you're gonna get it right


Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down


Don't bring me down, Groos
Don't bring me down, Groos
Don't bring me down, Groos
Don't bring me down


You're looking good, just like a snake in the grass
One of these days, you're gonna break your glass


Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down


You got me shaking, got me running away
You got me crawling up to you everyday


Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down, down, down, down, down, down


I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down
