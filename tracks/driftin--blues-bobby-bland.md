Oh, I'm drifting, I'm drifting, like a ship out on the sea
And oh, I'm drifting, drifting, drifting like a ship out on the sea
No, I ain't got nobody in this world to care for me
If my baby would only take me back again, back again
And oh, if my baby would only take me back again
Oh, I know I'm a good for nothing, oh, and I haven't got no friends

Listen to me honey, I gave you all my money
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, what more can I do
Didn't I give you all my money, now tell me what more can I do

Oh, I've realized you're a good little girl
But it seems you just won't be true, no, yeah
It seems like I gotta tell you bye, bye, baby
Baby, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye

Bye, bye, baby
Baby, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Listen to me, I know, I know you're gonna miss me
This time you'll be the one to cry
