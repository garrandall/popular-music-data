Oh love is funny that way, yeah, baby
Oh love is funny that way, yeah, baby

Cause one day you're happy
And the next day you're sad
How can you miss something baby
You never had
And just when you think that you're about to blow your mind
You suddenly realize
You can turn back the hands of time

Oh love is funny that way, yeah, believe me
Oh love is funny that way, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah surely the best parts of a love affair
Can't be found if your soul is not there
And lord oh lord How it can hurt when you feel it getting colder
But hold on to the one you love cause it gets better when it gets a little older

Oh love is funny that way, yeah, I understand it babe
Oh love is funny that way, yeah, yeah, yeah

I know I've been loving you much to much to long now
And no matter how you hurt me I got to keep holding to you somehow

Oh love is funny that way, yeah, believe me baby
Oh love is funny that way, yeah, yeah, yeah

I just can't turn you loose
Cause I've been loving you too long
A love like ours got to last
Cause it's been so double strong
Just put your loving arms around me
Tell me that I'm the only one
And say you're going to love me forever
And oh lord let it be done

Oh love is funny that way, yeah, believe me baby
Oh love is funny that way, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh love is funny that way, yeah, baby
Oh love is funny that way, yeah, yeah, yeah
