Your one and only love
That's all I want to be
Your one and only love
Through all eternity
All that I'm dreaming of
Is to be yours alone
Your one and only love
The one you call your own
To love you always
Always and always
Gladly I vow
To love you madly
To need you badly
Just as I need you now
Your one and only love
Someday someone will be
So won't you take my love
And fall in love with me
Your one and only love
Someday someone will be
So darling take my love
And fall in love with me
