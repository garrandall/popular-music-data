What would the world be like
Without music and a song
What would the world be like
If we all could get along
We could live in peace and harmony
Oh, can't you see, just you and me
Fill the world of love together
Make it last forever and ever, yeah!

Everybody all over the world
It's time for love and understanding

Come together
Let's come together
Let's come together
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Hey-hey, uh-huh, yeah!

What would the world be like
If we change the wrong to right
This whole world would be a better place
For you and me, oh, can't you see

Mothers
Fathers
Sisters
Brothers

Come together
Just come together
Come together
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Hey-hey, uh-huh, come together
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Hey-hey, uh-huh, come together

Come together
Just come together
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Everybody all over the world
It's time for love and understanding
Come together

Come together
Mother, come together
Father, come together

Everybody all over the world
Come together
Everybody all over the world
Come together
