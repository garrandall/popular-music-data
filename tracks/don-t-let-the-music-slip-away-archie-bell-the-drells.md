Don't let the music slip away, no, no
(Don't let it slip away now, baby)
Don't let the music slip away

See the wallflower on the shelf
Why you sitting over there by yourself
Are you afraid you'll
Get your hair messed up
If you come out on the floor
And do your stuff

Let's dance (let's dance)
(Let's dance, let's dance)
Let's make romance



Do you wanna wait
Till the music slow down
Or do you wanna start dancing now
The band is playing nice and loud
Come on, let's try to
Get lost in the crowd

Let's dance (let's dance)
(Let's dance, let's dance)
Let's make romance



Come out on the floor, girl
You're not gonna
Get your hair messed up
Come on, let's mess, you're not
Gonna get no wrinkles in your dress

Let's dance (let's dance)
(Let's dance, let's dance)
Come on, give it a chance
