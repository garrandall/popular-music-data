Hey baby, is that you
Wow, your hair got so long
Yeah, yeah I love it, I really do
âNorma Jeanâ, ain't that the song we'd sing
In the car driving downtown
Top down, making the rounds
Checking out the bands on Doheny Avenue

Yeah, life throws you curves
But you learned to swerve
Me, I swung and I missed
And the next thing you know, I'm reminiscing
Dreaming old dreams
Wishing old wishes
Like you would be back again

I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I head off to my job, guess not much has changed
Punch the clock, head for home, check the phone just in case
Go to bed, dream of you
That's what I'm doing these days
Yeah, that's what I'm doing

Someone told me after college
You ran off to Vegas
You married a rodeo cowboy
Wow, that ain't the girl I knew
Me, I've been a few places
Mostly here and there once or twice
Still sorting out life but I'm doing alright
Yeah, it's good to see you too

Well hey girl you're late
And those planes, they don't wait
But if you ever come back around
This sleepy old town
Promise me you'll stop in
To see an old friend
And until then

I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I head off to my job, guess not much has changed
Punch the clock, head for home, check the phone just in case
Go to bed, dream of you
That's what I'm doing these days...

These days...

I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I head off to my job, guess not much has changed
Punch the clock, head for home, check the phone just in case
Go to bed, dream of you
That's what I'm doing these...

I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
