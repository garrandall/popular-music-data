Crowded streets are cleared away one by one
Hollow heroes separate
As they run
You're so cold
Keep your hand in mine
Wise men wonder, while strong men die


Show me how it ends, it's alright
Show me how defenseless you really are
Satisfied and empty inside
Well, that's alright, let's give this another try


If you find your family
Don't you cry
In this land of make believe
Dead and dry
You're so cold, but you feel alive
Lay your hand on me, one last time


Show me how it ends, it's alright
Show me how defenseless you really are
Satisfied and empty inside
Well, that's alright, let's give this another try

Show me how it ends, it's alright
Show me how defenseless you really are
Satisfied and empty inside
Well, that's alright, let's give this another try


It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
