When she kissed me I was born and she said goodbye
And I knew right away I was born to cry
Now I'm happy and the joke's on her
'Cause I found that place for lover's who wander

She took my love, said she's not comin' back
So my world and my sky was all turnin' black
Now I see the light, I'm wise to her
'Cause I found that place for lovers who wander

A walkin' around thinkin' about her
Never thought I could live without her
She broke my heart, I really showed it
Look at me now, you'd never know it

Now my story can be told with a smiling face
I'm the luckiest guy in the human race
My dreams have gone for her
'Cause I found that place for lover's who wander

Wo wo wo yeah, she took my love you see
Yeah, she doesn't bother me
Yeah I found that place to be
Yeah, oh

Yeah walkin' around thinkin' about her
I never thought I could live without her
She broke my heart, I really showed it
Look at me now, you'd never know it

Now my story can be told with a smiling face
I'm the luckiest guy in the human race
All my lovin' dreams have gone for her
'Cause I found that place for lover's who wander

Dum dum did it, dum dum did it...
