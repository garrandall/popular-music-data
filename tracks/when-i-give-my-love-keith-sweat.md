When I give my love
When I give my love to you


When I give my love to you (Whoa'oh'), baby (My baby, baby)
I'll show you what love can do 'yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
When I give my love to you (When I give, when I give), baby (When I give love to you, baby, baby)
I'll show you what love can do (I will show you my love)
When I give my love to you


Hush, my baby, baby, don't say a word
I got so much love for you, girl, haven't you heard
Now I'm on a mission, girl, my intuition
Says you should be mine, I should be yours


When I give my love to you (When I lay, when I lay your body down), baby
I'll show you what love can do (I'll show you what a real love feels like, baby, yes, I will, girl)
When I give my love to you (And in the midnight hour, baby, in the midnight hour, baby), baby
(You're gonna want me, you're gonna love me)
I'll show you what love can do (Yes, you will, yes, you will, baby)
When I give my love to you


Don't you know, my baby, how much you mean to me
It don't, baby, take a blind man to see
 I can treat you right
I'll give you more love, girl, everything of mine


When I give my love to you (When I, baby, give my love to you), baby
I'll show you what love can do (I'll make you feel like you never did, baby)
When I give my love to you (When, when, baby), baby (When, baby, when, baby)
I'll show you what love can do (I'll show you what love can do, girl, yeah, baby)
When, when I give my love, my lovin' just to you


 You like this, baby
 (Oh, baby)
 Do you like it when we're layin' together
 (Oh)
 Yeah
 That's right, baby (Oh) get nasty
But I thought that's the way you like that (Oh)
 See, I understand
 (Oh) And you understand that I

 (Oh) Sometimes I just lose my mind and the freak
 Just comes on out of me
Are you ready for this, baby
Come on, baby


When I give my love to you (Come on, baby), baby (Oh, oh, baby)
I'll show you what love can do (Baby, I won't never, never, never, never do you wrong)
When I give my love to you (When I give my love to you, girl), baby (Oh, oh)
I'll show you (I'll show you) what love can do (I'll show you, baby, yes, I will)
When I give my love to you (I'm gonna lay you down tonight)
(I'm gonna make you feel like nobody else could, baby)
I'll show you what love can do (Come on, baby, let's change positions, baby, whoa, baby)
When I give my love to you (Baby, a-a-all day till the break of dawn)
I'll show you (Oh, baby) what love can do (All I wanna do is come in and out)
When I give my love to you (Out and in, ha-ha, in and out, I'm givin' my love to you)
When I give my love to you (You won't want nobody else)
When I give my love to you (Yeah, baby, oh'I'll give you my love to you)
When I give my love to you (Baby, baby, oh, oh, hoo')
When I give my love to you (I'm givin' my love)
When I give my love to you (I'm givin' my love)
