Can anybody find me somebody to love?

Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet (take a look at yourself)
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord, what you're doing to me
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord!
Somebody (somebody), oh, somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

I work hard (he works hard) every day of my life
I work 'til I ache my bones
At the end (at the end of the day)
I take home (goes home) my hard earned pay all on my own (goes home on his own)
I get down on my knees
And I start to pray (praise the Lord)
'Til the tears run down from my eyes
Lord, somebody (somebody), oh, somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

(He works hard)
Every day (every day) - I try and I try and I try -
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm going crazy
They say I got a lot of water in the brain
Oh, I got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe

Oh, I just got to get out of this prison cell
Someday I'm gonna be free

(Need to somebody to love bite)
(Need to somebody to love bite)
(Need to somebody to love bite)
(Need to somebody to love bite)
Oh

Love, love

Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

(Find me somebody to love)
Somebody to love
(Find me somebody to love)
Hey, yeah
(Find me somebody to love)
Whoa
(Find me somebody to love)
Find me, find me
(Find me somebody to love)
Somebody to love
