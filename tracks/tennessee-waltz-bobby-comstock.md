Well, I was dancing with my baby to the Tenne, Tennessee waltz
When an old friend I happened, I happened to see
I introduced her to my baby and while, and while they were dancing
My friend stole my baby from me
Well, I remember, remember that night and that Tennessee waltz
Well, you know just how much, how much I've lost
Well, I lost my, lost my baby the night, the night
That they were playing the beautiful Tennessee waltz
Well, I remember, remember that night and that Tennessee waltz
Well, you know just how much, just how much I've lost
Well, I lost, I lost my baby the night, the night
That they were playing the beautiful Tennessee waltz
Tennessee waltz, Tennessee waltz
