Slaughter's going to blow your mind
Slaughter does not waste his time
My advice to you is this
If you shoot at him you better not miss

Slaughter's big, bad, black and bold
The brother has a lot of soul
Don't you make him mean and cross
'Cause he'll show you who's the boss
Slaughter

Slaughter come to blow your mind
Slaughter does not waste his time
My advice to you is this
If you shoot at him, brother
You better not miss

Slaughter is big, bad, black and bold
The brother has a whole lot of soul
Don't you make him mean and cross
'Cause he will show you who's the boss
Slaughter

Yeah, Slaughter
Yeah, Slaughter
