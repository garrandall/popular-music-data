Goodbye T'Jane, goodbye T'Jane,
She's a dark horse see if she can
Goodbye T'Jane, goodbye T'Jane, painted up like a fancy young man


She's a queen, can't you see what I mean;
She's a queen
See, see, she's a queen
And I know she's alright, alright, alright, alright
I say you're so young, you're so young
I say you're so young, you're so young
I say you're so young, you're so young

I said
Goodbye T'Jane, goodbye T'Jane,
Get a kick from her forties trip boots
Goodbye T'Jane, goodbye T'Jane,
Has them made to match up to her suits



I said
Goodbye T'Jane, goodbye T'Jane,
Like a dark horse see how she ran
Goodbye T'Jane, goodbye T'Jane,
Spits on me cos' she knows that she can



I say you're so young, she's alright, alright, alright, alright.
I say you're so young, you're so young, alright, alright
I say you're so young
