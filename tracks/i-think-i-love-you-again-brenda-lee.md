We go out skating, on ice slowly melting in
Someday I think we're gonna drown
You're your own person, just the same way that I am
So sometimes we get each other down
Then I replace you, with a breaking body
A pretty face, but no mind
And I found feeling coming back to me
And I think I love again

Dancing together on thin lines of parting
Weighing the future all alone
One girl I'm where is forever
Is it somewhere in the sky
Or just a place, you call home

Sometimes while smiling
In the middle of the night child
As I taste this stranger's kiss
Oh, I miss you baby
Feel it coming back to me
And I found feeling coming back to me
And I think, I love you again
Baby, I know I love you again

Sometimes while smiling
In the middle of the night chat
As I keep this stranger's kiss
I miss you baby

Feel it coming back to me
And I think, I think I love you again
I think, I love, I love you again
Baby, I think, I think I love you again
Don't you know I love I know love you again
