Well, I met a little girl
At a dance last night
She let me kiss her
And hold her tight

She told me that
She'd always be true
But now she's running round
With somebody new

(She's a) heart breaker
Yes, she is (oh, yeah)
Heart breaker, yes, she is
(A heart breaker)
Heart breaker, yes, she is
(She broke my heart)
Heart breaker, yes, she is

Well, she took my heart
And she tore it apart, yeah
I should've know it
From the very start

She told me she loved me
With them emerald? eyes
She'd hold me close
And tell me lies

(She's a)
Heart breaker, yes, she is
(She broke my heart)
Heart breaker, yes, she is
(And tore it apart)
Heart breaker, yes, she is
(Well, I don't care)
Heart breaker, yes, she is
(I got so many girls, yeah)

Ah, well, now she's
With some other guy
And all she'll do is
Tell him lies

She'll never love only you
She always wants
Somebody new

(Now, she's a)
Heart breaker, yes, she is
(She broke my heart)
Heart breaker, yes, she is
(And tore it apart)
Heart breaker, yes, she is
(Oh, yeah, I said)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah now)

Heart breaker, yes, she is...
