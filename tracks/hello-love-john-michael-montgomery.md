Tore out her page from my little black book
Took out her picture, gave it one last look
Hung a big sign out on the door
Saying "Love don't live around here no more"

Packed up what was left of my pride
Topped up the tank for the long hard ride
Seventeen miles out of Loneliville
Yonder came my darlin' in a "Coupe de Ville"

So long heartache - adios
Sorrow see ya later time to hit the road
Goodbye pain and misery
Hello L-O-V-E

Well I spun around then I hit the gas
Hot on the tail of that Cadillac
Said a little prayer, held my breath
Sure enough the green light turned to red

So long heartache - adios
Sorrow see ya later time to hit the road
Goodbye pain and misery
Hello L-O-V-E

She looked at me - I looked at her
A few days later in a little brown church
Made a sweet deal with the justice of the peace
Forty-five dollars for a license and a ring
(Forty-five dollars for a license and a ring)

So long heartache - adios
Sorrow see ya later time to hit the road
Goodbye pain and misery
Hello L-O
Hello L-O
Hello L-O-V-E
