Spirit move me
Every time I"m near you
Whirling like a cyclone in my mind

Sweet Melissa,
Angel of my life time
Answer to all answers I can find

Baby I love you come, come
Come into my arms
Let me know the wonder of all of you
Baby I want you,
Now, now, now and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last

Lady take me
High upon a hillside
High up where the stallion meets the sun
I could love you
Build my world around you
Never leave you till my life is done

Baby I love you come, come
Come into my arms
Let me know the wonder of all of you
And baby I want you
Now, now, oh now, oh now and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last
Now could it be magic
Come, come on, come on
Come oh come into my arms
Let me know the wonder of all of you
Baby I want you
Now, now, oh now, oh now and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last
Could it be magic
Come, come on, come on, come, oh come into my arms
Let me know the wonder of all of you
Baby I want you
Now, now, oh now, oh now and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last.
Could it be magic
Come, come on, come on, come, oh come into my arms
Let me know the wonder of all of you
Baby I want you
Now, now, oh now, now oh now and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last
