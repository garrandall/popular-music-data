What's...a...guy gotta do to get a girl in this town
Don't wanna be alone when the sun goes down
Just a sweet little something to put my arms around
What's a guy gotta d to get a girl in this town

Well ask anybody I'm a pretty good guy
And the looks decent wagon didn't pass me by
There ain't nothing in my past that I'm tryin' hard to hide
And I don't understand why I gotta wonder why

What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town
Don't wanna be alone when the sun goes down
Just a sweet little somethin' to put my arms around
What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town

Cruise all around the right parking lots
Little time gets killed alotta bull gets shot
One who'll think I'm kinda cute and laugh at every joke I got
When I get to thinkin' maybe she's athinkin' maybe not

What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town
Don't wanna be alone when the sun goes down
Just a sweet little somthin' to put my arms around
What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town

Had an old man tell me, "Boy if you were smart
You'd hit the produce isle at the Super Walmart"
So I bumped into a pretty girl's shopping cart
But all I did was break her eggs and bruise her artichoke hearts

what's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town
Don't wanna be alone when the sun goes down
Just a sweet little somethin to put my arms around
What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town

What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town
