I know I was lookin' good
I had my Kenneth Cole shoes on
My Gianni Versace blue leather suit
My nails were done and my hair was fierce
And I was riding in a Cooper's limousine
(Don't you want to ride)
I was at home feelin' sleazy
So I went down to the speakeasy
As soon as my feet hit the door
I had all attention from the dance floor

Don't you know the men all pause
When I walked into the room
The men all pause
The men all pause
And the brides held their grooms
The men all pause
And they all sang the same old tune

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Check me out
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Starin' faces, startin' to get tired
I wanted to get out and go for a ride
Maybe this boredom created my hunger
So I said, "Pull over at the local fat burger"
I tried to walk in shy, very unnoticed
But the men turned away from their burgers and sodas
The focus was on me, I guess admirin' good taste
I tried to play it off but assurance was all over my face

The men all pause
When I walked into the room
The men all pause
The men all pause
And the brides held their grooms
The men all pause
And they all sang the same old tune

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Check me out
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

The men all pause when I hit the door
Attention came from the dance floor
When I went to the burger stand
I had my claim on any man

'Cause they all loved me
Slap me
No, somebody slap me
'Cause I know I'm lookin' good
I'm givin' attitude all over the room
People are starin' at me
And I just look too good for these people

D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d...
Don't you know the men all pause
Yeah, just look at them
(Woof!)
The dog is coming out of them
A natural dog
Radar!
(Woof!)
Radar!

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Check me out
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

The men all pause
The men all pause
The men all pause
The men all pause
The men all pause
The men all pause
The men all pause
The men all pause

Kitty, girl
I think I'm gonna leave right now
Because I have some things to do
Call my chauffeur
I love you, I love you all
But I got to go

Don't you know the men all pause
When I walked into the room
The men all pause
The men all pause
And the brides held their grooms
The men all pause
And they all sang the same old tune

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Check me out
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
