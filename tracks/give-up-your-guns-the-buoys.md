When I woke up this morning
I found myself alone
I turned to touch her hair
But she was gone, she was gone

And there beside my pillow
Were her tears from the night before
She said: "Give up your guns and face the law"

I robbed a bank in Tampa
And I thought I had it made
But the hounds picked up my trail within the glades
So I ran

And I stumbled on this cabin
And she came to me once more
She said: "Give up your guns and face the law"

I don't wanna leave her
I don't wanna die
Deep within a cold, cold grave
With no-one 'round to cry

But I've got my pistol
Now it's time to choose
Shooting here or hanging there
And either way I lose

And now I'm in this cabin
Where my own true love should be
Instead there lies a note she wrote to me
And it says:

"No, you can't live by the bullet
But you sure as death can die
My love, give up your guns or say goodbye, goodbye"

And the sheriff now is calling
With his shotgun at my door:
"Son, give up your guns and face the law"
