Mmm, You're my baby, say you love me
You're my baby, say you love me
You're my baby, say you love me
Say you love me and I'll love you

Hold me close and never leave me
Hold me close and never leave me
Hold me close and never leave me
Say you love me and I'll love you

Wrap your arms around me and hold me tight
Squeeze me, squeeze me darling with all your might
I love you baby, and I know it's true
Come on and tell me that you love me too

You're my baby, say you love me
You're my baby, say you love me
You're my baby, say you love me
Say you love me and I'll love you

(You're my baby, say you love me)
(You're my baby, say you love me)
(Say you love me and I'll love you)

(Hold me close and never leave me)
(Hold me close and never leave me)
(Say you love me and I'll love you)

Wrap your arms around me and hold me tight
Squeeze me, squeeze me darling with all your might
I love you baby, and I know it's true
Come on, come on and tell me that you love me too

You're my baby, say you love me
You're my baby, say you love me
You're my baby, say you love me
Say you love me and I'll love you
