Just how much can a lonely heart stand

You left me one morning
My world came to an end
You said you didn't love me
That it was only pretend
Now my lonely pillow
Is just a place for tears to land
Just how much can a Lonely Heart stand

Now my heart is broken
It seems that it will never mend
These Teardrops are tokens
They were all in your plan
Now life has no meaning
Yet no one seems to understand
Just how much can a Lonely Heart stand

I went out last night
To see if I could live again
That's when I saw you
Kissing my best friend
You walked right on by me
And you gently held her hand
Just how much can a Lonely Heart stand

Just how much can a Lonely Heart stand
