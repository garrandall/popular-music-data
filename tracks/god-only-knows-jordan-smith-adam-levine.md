I may not always love you
But long as there are stars above you
You never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it

God only knows what I'd be without you

If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?

God only knows what I'd be without you

God only knows what I'd be without you

If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would livin' do me?

God only knows what I'd be without you


God only knows what I'd be without you


God only knows what I'd be without you


God only knows what I'd be without you


God only knows what I'd be without you


God only knows what I'd be without you


God only knows what I'd be without you


God only knows what I'd be without you


God only knows what I'd be without you
