cut the music up please
yeah I should never leave hip hop
controlled by my two hands they go tick toc
around the clock, yes itâs my time, my throne
better know the time of day in any fucking time zone
Iâm feeling like Iâm on top of the rhinestone
pull in the ladder from heaven about to climb home
mental thoughts are sharper than a pine cone
in this world of numbers I keep my nine on
and I donât go to church because the line long
and the preacher he be getting his shine on
but I know my Lord I am Godâs own
back to my hands, tick tick a time bomb


Yeah, donât you know Iâll be (Iâll be)
Yeah, donât you know Iâll be (Iâll be)
Iâll be here cause I wonât quit yeah
you can try lock me up
you can try to break me down
but I stay strong
Itâs my throne
cant stop now cause that aint me
you can try lock me up
you can try to break me down
but I stay strong
Itâs my throne
cant stop now cause that aint me


Try to stay afloat on my inner tube
when they turn my city into a swimming pool
before that, it was a living cesspool
we got get on our shit like nats do
policeâs be on my tip like hats do
but I just stay strong like blacks do
never saved by the bell in a black school
and I stay in trouble like Zack do
and in this game nobodyâs on my plateau
therefore my name remains like a tattoo
yes I take giant steps in Shaq boots
B-I-R-D man junior or Weezy F Baby




that aint me
See I wonât stop, that aint me
I wont quit, that aint me
no I wont stop, that aint me
cause that aint me


Alright, Iâm in their conversations
the titles up for grabs Iâm into confiscation
punch, shot or stab now your the doctors patient
wild like an Arab from the Islamic nation
I get money round the clock, aint got no time for hating
and these niggas aint shit like their constipating
I get the coupe with the kit
watch me lobster red it
drop the top at the light thats when I be heading
so far ahead of them I feel outdated
but I feel electric like Iâm Raiden
used to play Mortal Kombat when I was a couch potato
now Iâm coming out with faders, no homo
