A-who, who, awho, who...


The childhood part of my life wasn't very pretty
You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city
It was a one room shack that slept ten other children beside me
We hardly had enough food or room to sleep
It was hard times
Needed something to ease my troubled mind


My father didn't know the meaning of the word
He disrespected Mama and treated us like dirt
I left home seeking a job that I never did find
Depressed and down-hearted, I took to Cloud 9

I'm doing (fine)
Up here (on cloud nine)
Listen, one more time
I'm doing (fine)
Up here (on cloud nine)


Folks now they tell me
They say, "Give yourself a chance and don't let life pass you by"
But the world around you is a rat race where only the strong survive
It's a dog-eat-dog world and that ain't no lie
Listen, it ain't even safe no more, to walk the streets at night


I'm doing fine on Cloud 9


Let me tell you about Cloud 9

(Cloud 9)
 You can be what you wanna be
(Cloud 9)
 You ain't got no responsibility
(Cloud 9)
 Every man, every man is free
(Cloud 9)
 You're a million miles from reality

(Reality) I'm gonna sail (up, up) higher (up, up... up, up and away) Cloud 9


I wanna say I love the life I live
And I'm gonna live the life I love
Up here on Cloud 9
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, I'm riding high on Cloud 9

 You're as free as a bird in flight
(Cloud 9) There's no difference between day and night
(Cloud 9) It's a world of love and harmony
(Cloud 9) You're a million miles from reality

(Reality) I'm gonna sail (up, up) higher (up, up... up, up and away) Cloud 9

 You can be what you wanna be
(Cloud 9) You ain't got no responsibility
(Cloud 9) Every man in his mind is free
(Cloud 9) You're a million miles from reality
(Cloud 9) You can be what you wanna be

Boom-boom-boom-boom-boom


I'm feeling fine on Cloud 9
