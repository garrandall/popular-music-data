Well, I grew up in one of them old farm towns
Where they hit it hard 'til the sun goes down
Nobody really seemed to care
That we were living in the middle of nowhere
We just figured thatâs how it was
And everybody else was just like us
Soaking in the rain baking in the sun
Donât quit 'til the job gets done

Thatâs the only way I know
Donât stop 'til everythingâs gone
Straight ahead, never turn round
Donât back up, donât back down
Full throttle, wide open
You get tired and you donât show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you canât dig no more
Thatâs the only way I know

That old red dirt â the first thing you learn
Is you donât get nothing that you donât earn
Humble pride that I grew up on
You find out just how bad you want it
Sun in our eyes backs to the fences
We didnât know the odds were against us
Hit the wall smoking and spinning
Still wasnât thinking âbout nothing but winning

Thatâs the only way I know
Donât stop 'til everythingâs gone
Straight ahead, never turn round
Donât back up, donât back down
Full throttle, wide open
You get tired and you donât show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you canât dig no more
Thatâs the only way I know

Maybe thereâs another path that'll
Get you there a little bit faster
But Iâm sticking with the one inside of me

Thatâs the only way I know
Donât stop 'til everythingâs gone
Straight ahead, never turn round
Donât back up, donât back down
Full throttle, wide open
You get tired and you donât show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you canât dig no more
Thatâs the only way I...

Thatâs the only way I know
Donât stop 'til everythingâs gone
Straight ahead, never turn round
Donât back up, donât back down
Full throttle, wide open
You get tired, you donât show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you canât dig no more
Thatâs the only way I know

Thatâs the only way I know
Thatâs the only way I know
The only way I know
