JUST GIRL TO BOY
I'D LIKE TO SHARE THIS THOUGHT WITH YOU
OUR LOVE'S A JOY
TWO ONE'S HAVE MADE INSEPARABLE TWO

LAST NIGHT MY HEART SPOKE TO ME AND
IT SAID YOU'VE FOUND THAT LOVER FRIEND
SO NOW I'VE FINALLY GOT THE COURAGE JUST TO ASK YOU BABY OOH


WILL YOU, WILL YOU
WILL YOU MARRY ME BOY
WILL YOU, WILL YOU
WILL YOU MARRY ME

WILL YOU, WILL YOU
WILL YOU MARRY ME BOY
WILL YOU, WILL
WILL YOU, WILL YOU, WILL YOU
COME ON BABY NOW

I LAY AWAKE
SO FULL WITH HOPE OF THINGS TO COME
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE
I PRAY I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
I NEVER DREAMED I'D BE SO BOLD
I'M STANDING HERE, MY HEART'S BEEN SOLD
SO NOW I'VE FINALLY GOT THE COURAGE JUST TO ASK YOU BABY OOH




THINK OF LOVE AS WINGS
NOT A BALL AND CHAIN
AND YOUR FEAR OF THINGS
UNNECESSARY
I ONLY WANT TO SHARE YOUR NAME
SHARE YOUR NAME

LAST NIGHT MY HEART SPOKE TO ME AND
IT SAID YOU'VE FOUND THAT LOVER FRIEND
SO NOW I'VE FINALLY GOT THE COURAGE JUST TO ASK YOU BABY OOH



MAYBE SUNDAY
COME ON MONDAY
BABY ANY TIME THIS WEEK

GET AN OLD HOUSE
FIND A BACK YARD
BUY SOME FLOWERS DOWN THE STREET

TELL YOUR MOTHER
TELL YOUR FATHER
DON'T TELL ANYONE AT ALL

ALL WE NEED IS
JUST THE TWO OF US

AND OOH...
