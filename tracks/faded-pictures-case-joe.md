That's right
Life is funny, ain't it?
Sometimes you can end up with
Somebody you really don't wanna be with
And others left to figure it out
Check it

She was more than a women a goddess for all to see
All I ever needed was her right here loving me
For a while we were coolin and groovin and love was on
But I still remember how it felt when are love was gone...(Ohhhhh)

 - Tattered picture book
Was a photograph she took years ago
Secret memories in her mind, how could love be so unkind
Heartbreak time

(My heart is breaking, Oh)

 - Faded pictures in abroken glass
Like a mirror revealing
What the woman is feeling
Was it someone from a distant past
Cuz it's breaking my heart
To watch her stare into the glass

(Joe help me out)

As she turned through the pages, the tears rolled down her face
I could see her reminiscing, whied her life have to be this way
As she stopped and she came to a page where her diary end
To smell the scent of an old rose, from her lover I suppose oh
(Picture book)

(Oh na, na, na, na, na, na)
As she stares into the glass, I'll be waiting
(Oh na, na, na, na, na, na)
Cuz she's lost inside the past
