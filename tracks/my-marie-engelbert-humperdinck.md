Marie
I can't bear to see the children without bread
Oh Marie
They deserve a decent roof above their heads

Trust me now
And when I leave for town, my darling, don't be sad
Or ask me how
But tomorrow, we'll have all the things we never had

But if I'm not back there with you
By the time the sun goes down
Take the train, change your name
And get the children out of town

Yes, if I'm not back there with you
By the time the sun has gone
Forget me, my Marie
And move on

Marie
You've never had a new dress you could wear
Oh Marie
You look so pretty with a ribbon in your hair

For too long
You've gone without the life that I once promised you
Right or wrong
But today I'll find a way to make it all come true

But if I'm not back there with you
By the time the sun goes down
Take the train, change your name
And get the children out of town

Yes, if I'm not back there with you
By the time the sun has gone
Forget me, my Marie
And move on
Forget me, my Marie
And move on
