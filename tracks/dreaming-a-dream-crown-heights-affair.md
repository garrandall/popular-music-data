I been having dreams
About affairs and car crashes, don't know why (why)
Got in my head, so attractive, I
Musta found a weakness in you
Shame about the shit you put me through
Don't you know the trouble you do?
If you knew, if you knew

I'd watch your tongue
It laps up scum
That makes a mess
On my red dress

And everybody in the lobby
Writes it off as "lazy", "slobby"
Clean me up and while I soak
Go and wash your mouth out with soap

I demand respect
What I want is what I get
I demand respect
Come and give it to me, yeah
I demand respect
What I want is what I get
I demand respect
Come and give it to me, hey

So you think you're nice
You behave like you've fallen from the sky
Like your grace is my calling, sigh
Like I'm Lucky to be in your presence
Making every joke at my expense
Did you never grow common sense?
You know best, you know best

I'd watch your tongue
It laps up scum
That makes a mess
On my red dress

I feel so dirty now you've hurt me
Blood ran cold and now I'm thirsty
Clean me up and while I soak
Go and wash your mouth out with soap

I demand respect
What I want is what I get
I demand respect
Come and give it to me, yeah
I demand respect
What I want is what I get
I demand respect
Come and give it to me, hey

You've been treated like royalty
So high your whole damn life
Now it's sad but it's clear to see
The lie has reached new heights
Show me the crown, and then I'll believe
Go drop the facade, or forfeit your Queen
See yourself on a mountain peak
Your highness, you've gone blind

I demand respect
What I want is what I get
I demand respect
Come and give it to me, yeah
I demand respect
What I want is what I get
I demand respect
Come and give it to me, hey

I demand respect
What I want is what I get
I demand respect
Come and give it to me (Come and give it to me)
I demand respect
What I want is what I get
I demand respect
Come and give it to me, hey
