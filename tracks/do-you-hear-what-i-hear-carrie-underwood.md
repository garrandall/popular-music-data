Said the night wind to the little lamb,
"Do you see what I see?
Way up in the sky, little lamb.
Do you see what I see?

A star, a star
Dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite,
With a tail as big as a kite."

Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy,
"Do you hear what I hear?
Do you hear what I hear?
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy,
Do you hear what I hear?
Do you hear what I hear?

A song, a song
High above the trees
With a voice as big as the sea,
With a voice as big as the sea."

Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king,
"Do you know what I know?
Do you know what I know?
In your palace warm, mighty king,
Do you know what I know?
Do you know what I know?

A child, a child
Shivers in the cold.
Let us bring him silver and gold.
Let us bring him silver and gold."

Said the king to the people everywhere,
"Listen to what I say.
Listen to what I say.
Pray for peace, people, everywhere.
Listen to what I say.
Listen to what I say.

The child, the child
Sleeping in the night.
He will bring us goodness and light.
He will bring us goodness and light."

He will bring us goodness and light
