Take it from me, I've had the experience
Finding the right love ain't easy to do
I've been looking and looking and searching around since
Nature started teching me just what to do

I can feel it bubbling up
All this love needs somewhere to live
Come and take a drink from my cup
I have a heart with so much to give

All the love is here so take it
Darlin' you know we can make it

I knew the minute I saw you
You were the one who'd be
Sharin' the love
I have the feeling inside me
You'll be beside me
Sharin' the love

I never believed in love at first sight
It's a foolish dreamer's fantasy
But one look at you showed me the light
And made a foolish dreamer of me

I can feel it bubbling up
All this love needs somewhere to live
Come and take a drink from my cup
I have a heart with so much to give

All the love is here so take it
It would be a sin to waste it

I knew the minute I saw you
You were the one who'd be
Sharin' the love
I have the feeling inside me
You'll be beside me
Sharin' the love
