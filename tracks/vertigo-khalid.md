Are we better off believin'
What the ignorance suggests
I wish livin' life was easy (Mhm)
But mine has been a mess
They say it comes with the seasons (Mhm)
But the seasons come and go (They go)
I go blurry when I'm thinkin'
Is it me or vertigo?

Criticized
Who am I to give up?
Breathing what's the reason to let up
Sympathize
Who am I to give up?
Putting on my favorite record tonight

Are we alive?
Or are we dreamin'?
After the ride
Are you leavin'?
Are we alive? (Riding this, riding in this)
Are we dreamin'? (Riding this, riding in this)
After the ride
Are you leavin'? (Riding this, riding in this)

I've been better, I've been broken
I've been battered up and beat
I wish I was more outspoken
But the words are out of reach
Hm, thought I loved you in the moment
I was happy, I was gone
I been learnin', I've been growin'
But the worst has yet to come

Criticized (Yeah)
Who am I to give up? (Who am I)
Breathing what's the reason to let up
Sympathize
Who am I to give up?
Puttin' on my favorite record tonight

Are we alive?
Or are we dreamin'?
After the ride
Are you leaving?
Are we alive? (Riding this, riding in this)
Are we dreamin'? (Riding this, riding in this)
After the ride
Are you leaving? (Riding this, riding in this)

(Who am I)

Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been fallin' with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been fallin' with my

Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been fallin' with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been fallin' with my

Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been fallin' with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been fallin' with my

Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been, I've been, I've been

Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been fallin' with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been fallin' with my

Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been fallin' with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been fallin' with my
