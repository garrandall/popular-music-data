Woo
Ah, can you feel it, baby?
I can (ay, yay)
Excuse me, do you think that I might be able to touch you?
{Who me?} (ay, yay)


I can tell you how I feel about you night and day
How I feel about you (No, no)
I can tell you how I feel about you night and day
How I feel about you


I'll love you more in the rain or shine
And makin' love in the rain is fine
A love so good and I call it mine
Love is blind


I can tell you how I feel about you night and day
How I feel about you (No, no, no)
I can tell you how I feel about (Woo) you night and day
How I feel about you (Ho, oh...)


Believe me when I say that I do care (I can tell you)
I'd like to run my fingers through your hair (I can tell you)
Baby, if you left I could not bear (I can tell you)
Please don't share

Do you love me, please let me know (I can tell you)
Don't hide the feeling, just let it show (I can tell you)
A feeling so deep that comes within (I can tell you)
What kind of love am I in, ooh...


I can tell you how I feel (Uh, ho) about you night and day
How I feel about you (No, no, no)
I can tell you how I feel (Ooh) about you night and day
How I feel about you (Ho, oh...)


If you and I were one, girl
The love we'd share would be so fun
Just take my hand and you'll see, girl
That we'd take off into another world


I can tell you how I feel about you (Ooh) night and day (Uh-huh)
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh)
I can tell you how I feel (Woo) about you night and day
(Making love in the rain is fine)
(Uh-huh...Kyle West, break it down)

I can tell you how I feel about you night and day
(Night and day, night and day, night and day)
I can tell you how I feel (Woo) about you night and day
(Making love in the rain is fine)

I can tell you how I feel about you night and day
(Repeat until fade)
