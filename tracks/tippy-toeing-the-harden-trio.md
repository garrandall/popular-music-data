Well mama go a tippy, tippy toein' through the house
Gotta see what's the matter with the baby
It's been bawlin' and a-sqwallin' and a-kickin' on the wall
Well I guess it dropped it's little bottle maybe

Oh, daddy come a-runnin' with the water and a rag
Gonna need another little diaper maybe
No need a-hesitatin' or a-wonderin' and a-waitin'
I know what's the matter with the baby
No need a-hesitatin' or a-wonderin' and a-waitin'
We know what's the matter with the baby

Oh mama rock a baby, daddy rock a baby too
It's a-yawnin' and a-gettin' sleepy maybe
So mama keep a-rockin', daddy rock a little too
And at last its a sleepin' little baby

Well mama's tippy toein', daddy's tippy toein' too
Gonna try to do a little sleepin' maybe
Whether it'll be a minute or an hour or two
Is dependin' 'tirely on the baby

Well I hear the clock a-ringin', just a-dongin' and a-dingin'
Daddy go and make a little money maybe
Mama sleep a little longer but remember while I'm gone
Won't you please take care of the baby
After all he's just a little bitty baby

Oh mama rock a baby, daddy rock a baby too
It's a-yawnin' and a-gettin' sleepy maybe
So mama keep a-rockin', daddy rock a little too
And at last its a sleepin' little baby
And at last its a sleepin' little baby
And at last its a sleepin' little baby
And at last
