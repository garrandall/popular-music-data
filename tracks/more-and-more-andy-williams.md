More and more I miss you, honey
More and more each day

Nights are, oh, so cold and lonely
Since you have gone away

When all this heartaches over
We will be back in clover
So please hurry home, I need you more
And more

More and more I miss you, honey
More and more each day

Nights are, oh, so cold and lonely
Since you have gone away

Though there are seas that part us
Home is right where the heart is
So please hurry home, I need you more
More and more
