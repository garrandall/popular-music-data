Say, this is the realist shit I ever wrote or said 
Wake up with it everyday and take it with me to bed 
Hurting my heart and hanging over my head 
Bout the realest nigga these Texas streets ever bred 
C.L. Butler better known as Chad or Pimp C 
The closest homeboy that I ever had 
Now when we first met, we wasn't on the same page 
From pettiness understandings that got cleared up with age 
Two young boys who was ready to mash 
Put P.A. on the map and maybe make a little cash 
Jumped down with Big Tyme, put down a few songs 
Everybody co-signed saying that we could do no wrong 
Then hit the streets with a big ass bang 
Them gangsta ass rhymes with that country ass twang 
Dropped "Tell Me Something Good" took off and went live 
Shit, next thing you know we was signing to Jive 
Dropped "Too Hard to Swallow" "A Pocket Full of Stones" 
Put the remix on "Menace" shit we had it going on 
Got love in the streets and played on the air 
But the homey putting us out, wasn't playing too fair 
Had to separate ourself, bring in a new team 
But sometimes the other side ain't always what it seems 
We dropped "Super Tight" a album full of killer flows 
But then we got caught up with the drugs and the hoes 
We didn't realize what was happening on the real 
And new management was cutting back room deals 
Hiding different money and ever sealing the price 
He had us doing all the work but was keeping the biggest slice 
Took a while to catch on, to what homey was doing 
But by the time we did, all the paperwork was in ruins 
Nigga kept all the receipts so we couldn't file taxes 
The next thing you know, IRS hitting us with axes 
Pimp you owe seven figures, Bun you owe six 
Better get your paper together, get this shit fixed 
Remixed the management team and tried it ourself 
Cussed out the GM, almost got put on the shelf 
Fuck it, dropped "Ridin' Dirty" instant classic in the South 
Reclaimed the southern title, shut everybody's mouth 
Got some clout in the game, boys calling us the greatest 
But meanwhile me and Pimp is still ducking haters 
The old manager calling and say he fina' sue 
And put a padlock on the everything we trying to do 
Put a call out to the Prince, this nigga still hating 
We got heat for the streets, and we can't keep the people waiting 
He made a call to ?? and folks, telling the man 
You gotta cut UGK some slack understand 
Young Pimp got the plan, Bun got the drawl 
Rap-A-Lot had our back and we just waiting on Jive 
We got the big bosses on the same page 
So me and young Pimp went hit 'em from center stage 
Next thing you know we got this call from the N.Y. 
It's Jay-Z saying y'all niggaz getting fly 
He doing "Volume 3" and got a track from Timb 
And wondered could some trill niggaz rock it with him 
Shit big Bun was all for it, but Pimp wasn't sure 
But "Big Pimpin" hit 'em 187-Pure 
Number one song on every station you turn on 
MTV and BET we getting our burn on 
Grammy nominated can't believe that we made it 
And we got a call from Jive that left us all faded 
And it stated, that due to the success of the track 
We here at Jive records, would like to piggy back 
Get another beat from Timb, then get a verse from Jay 
Let Hype shoot the video and we'll be on the way 
Shit it sounded okay, but me I had to ask 
If we don't do Big Pimpin 2, would you still put us on blast 
A song like that would might take a nigga to the top 
But my true fan base, might think a nigga flop 
They got mad and put niggaz on hold 
For damn near a year till the buzz got cold 
So we said fuck 'em and went back to the basics 
Trying to find ways to get the fuck up out the matrix 
We put "Dirty Money" together and it was aces 
But that's around the time that Pimp caught two cases 
He got probation, said fuck you hoes 
We finish the album, got ready to do a couple shows 
And then he violated, one month before we dropped 
And shit just got put on hold or fucking stopped 
Now 30 days done, we back to the nitty gritty 
Album got released, big showdown in Chocolate City 
Niggaz with masks on, vests and all black 
It's Christmas 2001, bitch we was all that 
Strongest on the block, nobody could budge 
And then he violated, now we right back before the judge 
They calling him a nuisance, put my dog behind a fence 
It was January 28th, he ain't been home since 
Threw a nigga through a loop and caught me in the crosses 
Standing cold, CEO, now I'm the fucking boss 
Had the devil on my back, got to drinking and drugging 
Had to make a choice, get back to rapping or thugging 
So I walked into my bedroom, got down on my knees 
Put my hands together and I prayed Lord please 
Let me get past this bridge over water that's trouble 
And get back up on my grind on the double 
He said son don't worry 
Cause it's not really hard as it seem 
And I can turn your nightmares back into dreams 
You just got to stay true to yourself and succeed 
Then push away from the devil and get closer to me 
And every since that night man I promise I been on it 
Giving that killer flow to anybody who want it 
Pimp the pen like never before, I'm breaking 'em G 
Not to mention I got the world screaming free Pimp C 
So soon as you make parole and they open the doors 
You ain't gotta worry about nothing, the world is yours 
Ain't no mo' struggles my nigga and no mo' stripe 
I kept it real because to me it's UGK for life
