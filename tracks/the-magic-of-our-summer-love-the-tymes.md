A walk along the beach
The world within our reach
That is the magic of our summer love

The sweetness of your lips
So very close to mine
The love light in your eyes
That happiness we find

Is the magic of our summer love
Is the magic of our summer love

Musical interlude

The whisper of the sea
Echoing your name
The soothing ocean breeze
That set my heart aflame

Is the magic of our summer love
Is the magic of our summer love
Is the magic of our summer love
Is the magic of our summer love
