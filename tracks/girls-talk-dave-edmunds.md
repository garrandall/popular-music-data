There are some things you can't cover up with lipstick and powder
Thought I heard you mention my name, can't you talk any louder?
Don't come any closer, don't come any nearer
My vision of you can't come any clearer
Oh, I just wanna hear girls talk

Got a loaded imagination being fired by girls talk
It's a more or less situation inspired by girls talk
But I can't say the words you wanna hear
I suppose you're gonna have to play it by ear, right here, and now

Girls talk
And they wanna know how girls talk
And they say it's not allowed, girls talk
If they say that it's so
Don't they think that I know by now

That the word up on everyone's lipstick that you're dedicated
You may not be an old-fashioned girl but you're gonna get dated
Was it really murder, were you just pretending
Lately I have heard you are the living end

Girls talk
And they wanna know how girls talk
And they say it's not allowed, girls talk
And they think they know how girls talk
If they say that it's so
Don't they think that I know by now

But I can't say the words you wanna hear
I suppose you're gonna have to play it by ear, I hear

There are some things you can't cover up with lipstick and powder
Thought I heard you mention my name, can't you talk any louder?
Don't come any closer, don't come any nearer
My vision of you can't come any clearer

Girls talk
And they wanna know how girls talk
And they say it's not allowed, girls talk
And they think they know how girls talk
Girls talk, girls talk
Girls talk, girls talk
Girls talk, girls talk
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah girls talk
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah girls talk
