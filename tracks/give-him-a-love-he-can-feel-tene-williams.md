I'm gonna give him, give him a love, give him
I'm gonna give him, give him a love, give him
I'm gonna give him, give him a love, give him
I'm gonna give him, give him a love, give him
I'm gonna give him, give him a love, give him
I'm gonna give him, give him a love, give him
Gonna give him, give him
Give him a love, oh yeah

I know that I'm gonna give him
I know that I'm gonna give him
I know that I'm gonna give him
Give him, give him


I'm wanna show him that I'm faithful
Just let him know that my love is true
This is no imitation
'Cause he's proven that he loves me too
And through it all, good and the bad times
You know he's taken real good care of me
I'm going all the way, can't turn my back now
I'll even sacrifice, 'cause it must be
I'm gonna give him

I'm gonna give him, give him a love, give him
I'm gonna give him, give him a love, give him
I'm gonna give him, give him a love, give him
I'm gonna give him, oh yes I am


Gonna give him love
Give him a love that he can feel
(Oh yes I am)
Gonna give him, give him, give him a love


He gives me something so very special
It's nothing different, or a rarity
When he's not around, I don't worry
'Cause he's given me security
He'll never give in to temptation
'Cause he knows what he's got waiting here
I'm gonna give him

I'm gonna give him, give him a love, give him
I'm gonna give him, give him a love, give him
I'm gonna give him, give him a love, give him
I'm gonna give him, oh yes I am


Gonna give him love
Give him a love that he can feel
(Oh yes I am)
Gonna give him love
Give him a love that he can feel
(I'm gonna give him)
Gonna give him love
Give him a love that he can feel
(Oh yes I am)
Gonna give him love
Give him a love that he can feel

I'm gonna, I'm gonna
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
I'm gonna let him know that my love is ture

Good love, my love, sweet love, real love (give him)
Good love, my love, sweet love, real love

(I'm gonna give him)
I know that I'm gonna give him
I know that I'm gonna give him
I know that I'm gonna give him
Give him, give him


I've got a good thing and I know it
I'll never take for granted how he feels
When we're together, there's no mistaking
This is real love, not make believe
I'm gonna give him

I'm gonna give him, give him a love, give him
I'm gonna give him, give him a love, give him
I'm gonna give him, give him a love, give him
I'm gonna give him, give him a love, give him
I'm gonna give him, give him a love, give him
I'm gonna give him, give him a love, give him
I'm gonna give him, give him a love, give him
I'm gonna give him, give him a love, give him

I'm gonna give him, give him a love, give him
I'm gonna give him, give him a love, give him
(Oh yes I am)
I'm gonna give him, give him a love, give him
I'm gonna give him, oh yes I am



Oh can you feel it?
