Hey baby, won't you take a little ride with me
Have a look around
See what we can see
I've got the paddle
I've got the boat
Come on baby, I know she'll float


We'll go rolling on the river of love
We'll go rolling on the river of love

Drift away from all these city lights
Might rock a little bit
So hold on tight
Let's get carried away with the gentle flow
Might get caught up in its undertow

We'll go rolling on the river of love
Let's go rolling on the river of love

I got a little ukulele, let me sing you a song
Got a stream of kisses about ten miles long
Dancing on the water in the moonlight beach
Sparkling down through the sea of dreams



River of love, River of love, River of love
Rolling on the river of love
Let's go rolling, rolling on the river of love
Let's go rolling on the river of love
Rolling on the river of love
Rolling on the river of love
Let's go rolling, rolling on the river of love
