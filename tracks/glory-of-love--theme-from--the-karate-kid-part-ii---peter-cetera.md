Tonight it's very clear
'Cause we're both lying here
There's so many things I wanna say
I will always love you
I would never leave you alone


Sometimes I just forget
Say things I might regret
It breaks my heart to see you crying
I don't wanna lose you
I could never make it alone


I am a man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero you're dreaming of
We'll live forever
Knowing together
That we did it all for the glory of love


You keep me standing tall
You help me through it all
I'm always strong when you're beside me
I have always needed you
I could never make it alone


I am the man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero you've been dreaming of
We'll live forever
Knowing together
That we did it all for the glory of love


It's like a knight in shining armor
From a long time ago
Just in time I will save the day
Take you to my castle far away


I am the man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero that your dreaming of
We're gonna live for ever
Knowing together
That we did it all for the glory of love

We'll live forever
Knowing together
That we did it all for the glory of love


We did it all for love
We did it all for love
We did it all for love
We did it all for love
