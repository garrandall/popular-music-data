Some people suppress you
They parch you
And reap a disaster
Re-education for the infants
Who demanded for an innocent instance

The great commandment shows the contempt
Between the world and their embarrassing pavement
Believe the scholars
Read the readings
Realize the man who says anything

The great commandment

The needers believe you
They treat you
Like survivors of a disaster
Re-education for the infants
Who demanded for an innocent instance

The great commandment shows the contempt
Between the world and their embarrassing pavement
Believe the scholars
Read the readings
Realize the man who says anything

The great commandment shows the contempt
Between the world and their embarrassing pavement
Believe the scholars
Read the readings
Realize the man who says anything

The great commandment
