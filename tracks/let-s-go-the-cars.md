She's driving away
With the dim lights on
And she's making a play
She can't go wrong
She never waits too long
She's winding them down
On her clock machine
And she won't give up
'Cause she's seventeen


She's a frozen fire
She's my one desire
And I don't want to hold her down
Don't want to break her crown
When she says


Let's go
(I like the nightlife baby)
She says
(I like the nightlife baby)
She says
(Let's go)


She's laughing inside
'Cause they can't refuse
She's so beautiful now
She doesn't wear her shoes
She never likes to choose
She's got wonderful eyes
And a risquÃ© mouth
And when I asked her before
She said she's holding out


She's a frozen fire
She's my one desire
And I don't want to hold her down
Don't want to break her crown
When she says


Let's go
(I like the nightlife baby)
She says
(I like the nightlife baby)
She says
(Let's go)


(I like the nightlife baby)
She says
(I like the nightlife baby)
She says
(Let's go)
