Mm-hmm...
This one goes out
To all the suckers out there
Who thought I was soft
When I dropped Knockin' Boots
For the ladies
But I'm-a come correct this time
And do something a little bit different
(Who you gonna cook this to, man?)
Mmm, the ladies

Melt in your mouth, not in your hand
The C-A to the -ndy was the M-A-N
I'm like no other man, 'cause you know no other man can
Be an undercover lover and a soul brother man
On the other hand, introduce me to your mother and
I wouldn't be surprised if she's my number one fan
Here I stand a full six-feet-three
And the perfect match has to be when you meet me
Under a palm tree in the middle of the beach
Bring a towel or a sheet like the boots with sand on my feet
After we eat what we brought on the pier
I hear your earrings jingle like a chandelier
As you premiere what you hear is not a simile
But it's meant to be the poetry as me, a K-I-N-G
There'll never be another Candyman
Because I melt in your mouth, not in your hand

Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth, not in your hand

Lip smacking good, good to the last drop
If I didn't have to go, I know you never would stop
I'm on the top of your list for the best French kiss
I assist on your one last wish, and since
I'm not the type to fall in love on sight
I'm-a let you hold me tight for just one night
Since I write the rhymes to make the whole world sing
It doesn't mean a thing when you call me the king
And bells won't ring 'til I walk down the aisle
You could smile, but that won't be for a long while
It'll take more than a killer behind to change my mind
I'm not blind, I know the time
See, I'm not the kind to write a rhyme while you laugh
Ha, ha, ha, girl, I get half
So as I see it, you don't need a wedding band
'Cause I melt in your mouth, not in your hand

Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth, not in your hand

Thirst quenching, did I mention
Give a chick an inch and she'll want an extension
Pictured on my heiny right behind me is the man of the house
Suggesting that I burn the hell out
You begin to count, but no doubt, you call my cellular phone
Because I melt in your mouth like a snow cone
On and on as the saga continues
Here's another page on the menu
When you see the Candyman, you see me as a hot hor d'oeuvre
And you got a lot of nerve
First come, first served is the usual procedure
After I tell you that I need you
Featured with any kind of line that I think what's best for you
Because I wanna get next to you
Sex with you is just one small part of the plan
Because I melt in your mouth, not in your hand

Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth, not in your hand

Melt in your mouth, not in your hand
The C-A to the -ndy was the M-A-N
I'm like no other man, 'cause you know no other man can
Be an undercover lover and a soul brother man
On the other hand, introduce me to your mother and
I wouldn't be surprised if she's my number one fan
Here I stand a full six-feet-three
And the perfect match has to be when you meet me
Under a palm tree in the middle of the beach
Bring a towel or a sheet like the boots with sand on my feet
After we eat what we brought on the pier
I hear your earrings jingle like a chandelier
As you premiere what you hear is not a simile
But it's meant to be the poetry as me, a K-I-N-G
There'll never be another Candyman
Because I melt in your mouth, not in your hand

Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth, not in your hand
