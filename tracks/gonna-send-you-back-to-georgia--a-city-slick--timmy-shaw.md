You had nothin' when I met you, baby
But look what you've got now
Sometimes I wonder did I made a mistake
When I brought you from the South

But I'm gonna send you back to Georgia
Girl, that's where you belong
You done got in the big city
You done started doin' me wrong,

Your mama and your daddy, they told me, baby
That I could bring you from the south
They brought you to the city
When you were just a child
And the bright lights drove you wild

I'm gonna send you back to Georgia
Girl because you don't know a thing
Now, when I first, I met you, baby
You couldn't even read or write your name
You sure was dumb

You run the streets with your bald head
Tryin' to play the high class game
You'd run those streets on both day and night
You don't have pocket change

But I'm gonna send you back to Georgia
Girl before having to use my rod
And I can't understand it baby
What is makin' your head so hard
