Know that I grow my hair just to scare the teacher
My goodness gracious me, ain't little Johnny a creature
And I lost count of the times when I never bathed

I'm one of the boys, one of the boys
I don't say much but I make a big noise
And it's growing, alright, it's growing

I borrowed Gypsy's Gibson just to show them
And now I'm a rock and roll star, I don't want to know them
If they want a stray, they better go out and grow one

I'm one of the boys, one of the boys
I'm only human, so I ain't got no choice
And I know it, yeah, I know it, alright

Hit it, c'mon!

I'm just one of the boys, one of the boys
I don't say much but I make a big noise
It's growing, yeah, it's growing

I'm one of the boys, one of the boys
I'm only human, so I ain't got no choice
And I know it, yeah, I know it

One of the boys
I'm just one of the boys
One of the boys
I'm just one of the boys

One of the boys
I'm just one of the boys
One of the boys
I'm just one of the boys

Lets go! Alright!

Just, just, just, just, just
Just, just, just, just, just
Just, just, just, just, just
Just, just, just, just, just
