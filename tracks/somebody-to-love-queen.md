Can anybody find me somebody to love?


Oh each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
(Take a look at yourself in the mirror and cry)
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord what you're doing to me (Yeah, yeah)
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord


Somebody (Somebody)
Oh somebody (Somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Yeah


I work hard (He works hard) every day of my life
I work 'til I ache my bones
At the end (At the end of the day)
I take home my hard-earned pay all on my own (Goes home, goes home on his own)
I get down (Down) on my knees (Knees)
And I start to pray (Praise the Lord)
'Til the tears run down from my eyes, Lord


Somebody (Somebody)
Oh somebody (Please)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Oh


(He works hard) everyday (Everyday)
I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
No, I got no common sense
(He's got) I got nobody left to believe
No, no, no, no




(Oh, Lord)
Ohsomebody
Oh(Somebody)
Anybody find me
Somebody to love
(Can anybody find me someone to love)


Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat (You just keep losing and losing)
I'm okay, I'm alright (He's alright, he's alright)
I ain't gonna face no defeat (Yeah, yeah)
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
(One day) Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord


Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Somebody (Somebody)
Somebody (Somebody)
Somebody (Find me)
(Somebody find me somebody to love)
Can anybody find me
Somebody to
Love?
(Find me somebody to love) Oh

(Find me somebody to love) Somebody, somebody, somebody to love
(Find me somebody to love) Find me, find me, find me, find me, find me
(Find me somebody to love) Oh  somebody to love
(Find me somebody to love) Oh find me, find me, find me somebody to love
