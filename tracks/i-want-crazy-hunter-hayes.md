I'm booking myself a one-way flight
I gotta see the color in your eyes
Yeah, tellin' myself I'm gonna be alright
Without you, baby, is a waste of time

Yeah, our first date, girl, the seasons changed
It got washed away in a summer rain
You can't undo a fall like this
'Cause love don't know what distance is

Yeah, I know it's crazy

But I don't want "good" and I don't want "good enough"
I want "can't sleep, can't breathe without your love"
Front porch and one more kiss
It doesn't make sense to anybody else
Who cares if you're all I think about
I've searched the world and I know now
It ain't right
If you ain't lost your mind

Yeah, I don't want easy
I want crazy
You with me, baby?
Let's be crazy

I wanna be scared. Don't wanna know why
Wanna feel good. Don't have to be right
The world makes all kinds of rules for love
I say you gotta let it do what it does

I don't want just another hug and a kiss goodnight
Catchin' up calls and a date sometimes
I love that we're rebels, and we still believe
We're the kind of crazy people wish that they could be

And I know we're crazy, yeah

But I don't want "good" and I don't want "good enough"
I want "can't sleep, can't breathe without your love"
Front porch and one more kiss
It doesn't make sense to anybody else

Who cares if you're all I think about
I've searched the world and I know now
It ain't right
If you ain't lost your mind

Yeah, I don't want easy
I want crazy
You with me, baby?
Let's be crazy

No, I don't want "good" and I don't want "good enough"
I want "can't sleep, can't breathe without your love"
Front porch and one more kiss
It doesn't make sense to anybody else

Who cares if you're all I think about
I've searched the world and I know now
It ain't right
If you ain't lost your mind

Yeah, I don't want easy
I want crazy
Yeah, look at us, baby
Tonight the midnight rules are breaking

There's no such thing as wild enough
And maybe we just think too much
Who needs to play it safe in love?
Let's be crazy!

Who cares if we're crazy? We gotta be crazy!
I know that we're crazy. so let's be crazy!
