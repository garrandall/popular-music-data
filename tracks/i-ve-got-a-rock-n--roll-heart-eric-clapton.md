I've got a feeling we could be serious, girl
Right at this moment, I could promise you the world
Before we go crazy, before we explode
There's something about me, baby, you got to know
You got to know


I get off on '57 Chevys
I get off on screaming guitar
Like the way it hits me every time it hits me
I've got a rock and roll, I've got a rock and roll heart


Feels like we're falling into the arms of the night
So if you're not ready, don't be holding me so tight
I guess there's nothing left for me to explain
Here's what you're getting and I don't want to change
I don't want to change

I don't need to glitter, no Hollywood
All you got to do is lay it down and you lay it down good
