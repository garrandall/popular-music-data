I don't want to see you

I  don't care cause it don't matter
She's  gone now, my heart ain't shattered
When it's gone you gotta cut and run
I met her at a drive in movie
She  had a kiss that felt so new to me
I  couldn't find her if I wanted to

Now at night I ain't dreamin
Walls  closin in, my heart starts screaming
I can't stop this running
And I'm not listening to my head

I don't want to see you No more
I  don't want to even the score
Ever since you went away
I've been stronger every day
I don't want to call out your name
I don't want to relive the pain
After all that we've been through
Baby, give me all of you or run away

I get gone makes me better
For each mile I'll be forgetting her
Till I look into the setting sun
Her gold hair, she moves so slowly
Just like a dream, she faded all away
I wonder will she come away
If I go back, will I go crazy
Left thinking of my mixed up baby
I can't stop the feeling that I've been so lost without her

I don't want to see you No more
I don't want to even the score
Ever since you went away
I've been stronger every day
I don't want to call out your name
I don't want to relive the pain
After all that we've been through
Baby, give me all of you or run away

You give me something you already got
I figured it out
If I don't love you I can't lose a lot
So baby please remember to the day we're together
I don't wanna

I don't want to see you No more
I don't want to even the score
Ever since you went away
I've been stronger every day
I don't want to call out your name
I don't want to relive the pain
After all that we've been through
Baby, give me all of you

I don't want to see you No more
I don't want to even the score
Ever since you went away
I've been stronger every day
I don't want to call out your name
I don't want to relive the pain
After all that we've been through
Baby, give me all of you

I don't want to see you No more
I don't want to even the score
Ever since you went away
I've been stronger every day
I don't want to call out your name
I don't want to relive the pain
After all that we've been through
Baby, give me all of you
