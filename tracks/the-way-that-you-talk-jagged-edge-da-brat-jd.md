It's scary, I'm Miss Up's to da area 
So So Def, next to Jay D 
This funkdafide baby keep 'em crazy 
My mentality happen to be livin' lavish 
With formalities of having the fat shit 
My status is impeccable 
We wreckin' yo crew, the casualty is you 
Jagged Edge coming through 
Remember who 
Hit it, did it something like a thousand times 
Can't stop, can't quit 
Gotta, gotta get mine 
Get yours 
I catch you off guard 
Keep yo dick hard 
Follow the yellow bitch 
To the road to riches 
And if the smoke thickens 
It's to be the beat 
Or it detrimental to your brain 
Choakin' off Mary Jane 
A.T. lettin' it ill, say 'kay 
And kept it wetter than Niagra 
The main dame who maintain to stay platinum, yeah, aww 
We talking, me touchin you and your body 
We even talkin' 'bout you and your other guys 
I like it when you tell me what you'd do if I was with you 
I like it cuz you have nothin' to hide 

 - The way that you talk to me 
The things that you say to me 
You got my body girl 
Have your way with me 
I'm tellin' you now 
There's something about 
Girl, I can't live without 
The way you talk to me 
We talking 'bout dreams you have about you and I 
You tell me things I did to you once I got up inside 
You make me look forward to the future 
Wanna have a wife and kid 
Cuz all the time that I been gettin' around 
I never felt like this, yeah 
I know you know baby, how much I love you 
I love you, you love me, and I know 
Baby, I know, whoa, yeah, whoa 
When I call yo name 
It's all about the poom poom nanny nanny 
And mo' money 
With me pink bunny and the G 
You just in the D J.E. era 
Chromed out carreras 
Sex, boozin', and nonstop I flow watch out 
Gimme some chrystal, a sip or so 
You can send 'em all back 
The type that walk up in the club screamin' 
Where the ho's at 
Tracks stay steaming, keep your floors packed 
Diamonds stay gleeming and you're no match 
For me and my faculty 
Actually all y'all are whacked to me 
Send me some some true playa's, with true rank 
Don't give a damn what you think 
Make a bet and I'll stop yo' bank, baby 
You dress jiggy, body bomdigi 
Then it's a possiblity that you and I can get busy 
What chu wanna do, shit 
I got a pocket full of rubbers, and Jay D. do too 


Make you scream Papa 
You the best da da
