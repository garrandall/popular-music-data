Why am I so starry eyed,
Starry eyed and mystified,
Every time I look at you,
Falling stars come into view;

Could it be that I'm in love
With an angel from above?
I ask my heart, my heart replies
"Yes that's just why you're so starry eyed."

When we touch I hear angels sing,

When we kiss, I hear wedding bells ring 
Can't explain what I feel inside,
But I know it's love, true love at last;

I know why I'm starry eyed,
Starry eyed and mystified,
