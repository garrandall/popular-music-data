Out here nothin' changes
Not in a hurry anyway
You can feel the endlessness
With the comin' of the light of day
You're talkin' 'bout a chosen place
You wanna sell it in a marketplace
Well

You're standin' on solid rock
Standin' on sacred ground
Livin' on borrowed time
And the winds of change are blowin' down the line

Right down the line

Round about the dawn of time
When the dreaming all began
A crowd of people came
Well they were lookin' for their promised land
We're runnin' from the heart of darkness
Searchin' for the heart of light
It was their paradise

Well they were standin' on solid rock
Standin' on sacred ground
Livin' on borrowed time
And the winds of change were blowin' cold that night

Well they were standin' on the shore one day
Saw the white sails in the sun
Wasn't long before they felt the sting
White man, white law, white gun
Don't tell me that it's justified
Cause somewhere someone lied
Someone lied, someone lied, someone lied
Genocide

And now you're standin' on solid rock
Standin' on sacred ground
Livin' on borrowed time
And the winds of change are blowin' down the line

Solid rock
Standin' on sacred ground
Livin' on borrowed time
And the winds of change are blowin' down the line

Solid rock
Standin' on sacred ground
Livin' on borrowed time
And the winds of change are blowin' down the line
