Not again
This ain't supposed to happen to me


Keep rockin', and keep knockin'
Whether you Louboutin'd up or Reeboking
You see the hate, that they're servin' on a platter
So what we gon' have: dessert or disaster?


I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like I'm in a race
But I already won first place

I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did
(as hard as I did)
You got me thinkin' 'bout our life, our house and kids
Every morning I look at you and smile
'Cause boy you came around
And you knocked me down, knocked me down

Sometimes love comes around
(love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down
(knocks you down)
Sometimes love comes around
(love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down
(knocks you down)


I've never thought I'd hear myself say
Ya'll gon' hate
I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today
(kick it with my girl today)
I used to be commander-in-chief
Of my pimp ship flyin' high (flyin' high)
'Til I met this pretty little missile
That shot me out the sky
(oh shot me out the sky)

Captain now I'm crashing,
Don't know how it happened
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could go back and make it happen faster
Don't you know I would baby if I could
Miss Independent (oh, to the fullest),
The load never too much,
She helping me pull it
She shot the bullet
That ended that life
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight
Girl sometimes love

Sometimes love comes around
(love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down
(knocks you down)
Sometimes love comes around
(love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down
(knocks you down)


Tell me now can you make it past your Caspers
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dreams
That seemed to only date the head of football teams
And I was the class clown that always kept you laughin'
We were never meant to be baby we just happened
So please, don't mess up the trick
Hey young world I'm the new slick rick
They say I move too quick
But we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess ask someone that's only average
For advice
O.M.G, you listen to that, bitch?
Woe is me
Baby this is tragic
'Cause we had it, we was magic

I was flyin', now I'm crashin'
This is bad, real bad, Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad, Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'mma ask him


So I gotta take the good with the bad, happy and the sad
What were you bring a better future than I had in the past
Oh 'cause I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again
I'll admit it, I was scared to answer love's call
And if it hits better make it worth the fall

(When it comes around)

Sometimes love comes around
(love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down
(knocks you down)
Sometimes love comes around
(love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down
(knocks you down)

Won't see it coming when it happens
But when it happens you're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love comes and knocks you down

Won't see it coming when it happens
But when it happens you're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love comes and knocks you down
