What a drag it is
These gold lame jeans
Is this the coolest way
To get through your teens
Well, I cut my hair (well, I cut my hair weird)
With a rib that it was in (I read that it was in)
I looked like a rooster
Than was drowned and raised again

What are you gonna do
I tell you what I'm gonna do (I'll tell you what I'm gonna do)
Why don't you get away
I'm gonna leave today

I ran into my room
And I fell down on my knees
Well, I thought that fifteen
Was gonna be a breeze
I picked up my guitar
To blast away the clouds
But somebody in the next room yield (but somebody in the next room yelled)
"You gotta turn that damn thing down!"

What are you gonna do
I tell you what I'm gonna do (I'll tell you what I'm gonna do)
Why don't you get away
Well, I'm gonna cry all day

And I know trouble
Is brewin' out there
But I can hardly care
They fight all night
About his private secretary
Lipstick stain, blond hair
What are you gonna do
I tell you what I'm gonna do
Why don't you run away
I'm gonna leave today

But even I
Don't know what I'm gonna do
Don't know what I'm gonna do
What are you gonna do
I tell you what I'm gonna do (I'll tell you what I'm gonna do)
Why don't you run away
Well, I'm gonna leave today
What are you gonna do
I tell you what I'm gonna do (I'll tell you what I'm gonna do)
Why don't you get away
Well, I'd rather cry all day

What are you gonna do, gonna do, gonna do...
