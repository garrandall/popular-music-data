Well, I been working in a coal mine 
Going down, down 
Working in a coal mine 
Whew, about to slip down 

Working in a coal mine 
Going down, down 
Working in a coal mine 
Whew, about to slip down 

Five o'clock in the morning 
I'm up before the sun 
When my work day is over 
I'm too tired for having fun 

Well, I been tired but I been
Working in a coal mine 
Going down, down 
Working in a coal mine 
Whew, about to slip down 

Working in a coal mine 
Going down, down 
Working in a coal mine 
Whew, about to slip down 

Lord, I am so tired 
How long can this go on? 

Well, I been working in a coal mine 
Going down, down 
Working in a coal mine 
Whew, about to slip down 

Working in a coal mine 
Going down, down 
Working in a coal mine 
Whew, about to slip down 

Five o'clock in the morning 
I'm up before the sun 
When my work day is over 
I'm too tired for having fun 

Well, I been tired but I been
Working in a coal mine
Going down, down 
Working in a coal mine 
Whew, about to slip down 

Working in a coal mine 
Going down, down 
Working in a coal mine 
Whew, about to slip down 

Lord, I am so tired 
How long can this go on? 

I been a-working, going, working 
Whew, about to slip down 

Working, going, working 
Whew, about to slip down 

Working, going, working 
Whew, about to slip down 

Working, going, working 
Whew, about to slip down 

Working, a-going, working 
Whew, about to slip down 

Working, going, working 
Whew, about to slip down 

Working, going, working 
Whew, about to slip down
