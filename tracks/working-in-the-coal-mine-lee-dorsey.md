(Workin' in a coal mine)
(Whoops! About to slip down)
(Workin' in a coal mine)
(Goin' down down down)

Five o'clock in the mornin'
I'm already up and gone
Lord-a, I'm so tired
How long can this go on?

'Cause I make a lil morning
Haul the coal by the ton
But when Saturday rolls around
I'm too tired for havin' fun
(Too tired for havin')
