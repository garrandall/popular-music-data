At seventeen we fell in love
High school sweethearts, love was so brand new
We took the vows of man and wife
Forever, for life


I remember how we made our way
A little patience, the time we pray
Can't imagine that this love is through
Feelin' the pain, girl, when you lose


Oh it's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
We gotta cool this anger
What a mess we've made
So long ago
You were my love, oh my love


Flyin' high we never took the time
To stop and feel the need
Funny how those years go by
Changing you, changing me


I remember love's fever
In our hearts, girl and in our minds
Can't imagine that this love is through
Feelin' the pain, girl, when you lose


Oh it's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta cool this anger
What a mess we've made
So long ago
You were my love
Feeling
The pain

Oh it's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta cool this anger
From this mess that we've made
Oh it's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot (too hot)
So, so hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta cool this anger
Oh, gotta cool this mess we've made
It's so, so hot, baby (too hot)
Yes it's so hot (too hot)
I just can't take it
I can't stand no more, baby
We were once lovers (too hot)
We took our vows (too hot)
A man and wife
Forever
Oh (too hot)
(too hot)
Baby (too hot)
Please won't you listen (too hot)
It hurt me so bad
But I know I've got to leave
(Too hot)
It's too hot (too hot)
Gotta run for shelter, baby
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot (too hot)
It's so, so hot, baby (too hot)
Gotta cool this anger
Gotta cool this mess we've made
It's so warm (too hot)
It's so warm (too hot)
It's hot baby, yeah
Gotta run for shade
Come on (too hot)
I'm leaving (too hot)
Goodbye
Don't cry
