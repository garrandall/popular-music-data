I didn't think I could make it
Statistics said I should be dead by now
Trouble and wars all around me
The doctors surely had counted me out

After all that I had to face
You've been there and you turned it in every way

I survived it
I survived it
I survived it
Now I can go on

I didn't think I could make it
Statistics said I should be dead by now
Trouble and wars all around me
The doctors surely had counted me out

After all that I had to face
You've been there and you turned it in every way

I survived it
I survived it
I survived it
Now I can go on

When something stands in my way
I know I can make it
I won't cease, I'll just praise my way through
That's how I'll take it

When something stands in my way
I know I can make it
I won't cease, I'll just praise my way through
That's how I'll take it

I survived it
I survived it
I survived it
Now I can go on

When something stands in my way
I know I can make it
I won't cease, I'll just praise my way through
That's how I'll take it

When something stands in my way
I know I can make it
I won't cease, I'll just praise my way through
That's how I'll take it

I survived it
I survived it
I survived it
So come what may, I'll be okay

I survived it
I survived it
I survived it
So come what may, I'll be okay

I survived it
I survived it
I survived it
So come what may, I'll be okay

I survived it
I survived it
I survived it
So come what may, I'll be okay

I survived it
I survived it
I survived it
So come what may, I'll be okay

I survived it
I survived it
I survived it
So come what may, I'll be okay

I survived it
I survived it
I survived it
Now I can go on

I survived the worst of times
I survived when I didn't have a dime
The Lord brought me through, can't you see?
Now I can be what I want to be
Doctor, lawyer, maybe even president
Who showed me through many African American
By His grace I've come a long way
That same grace helped me see another day
Now I live through it, walk to it
But don't let nothing stop you from doing it
Keep your faith and never ever cease to pray
My God has always laid the way
The road is rough and the going gets tough
But that's alright, I had just about enough
I ain't gonna ever ever give up
Because I am a true survivor
