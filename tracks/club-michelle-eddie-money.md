Well you know I got to find it
It's on a dark deserted street
But you know I had a time there
Hey driver, can you help me?

I'm lookin' for the Club Michelle

Well our eyes met very slowly
As we stared right through the crowd
And we started dancing
And they played that song

That crazy song again and again

I can still hear them singing

Whoo-oo-oh-ohnd they played that song
At the Club Michelle it went on and on
Whoo-oo-oh-oh

I remember oh so well
Dancing at the Club Michelle

Well we moved into a corner
We were lookin' for a little room
There were so many people

And just when we started talking
They played that song again
We both got so confused and they played it kinda loud
I lost her in the crowd

Whooo-oo-oh-oh and they played that song again
Everybody kept on singing
At the Club Michelle and everybody kept on dancing
Whoo-oo-oh-oh
And I lost that little girl

It was somewhere called the Club Michelle

Gonna keep looking
Yeah I'm gonna find her

But I know it's around here somewhere, somewhere
Down the corner, maybe make a right
Yes I know I've got to find that girl
I'm gonna keep on looking
'Cause I'm gonna find it
Wait a minute, can you hear it?
I think I hear 'em singing

Whoo-oo-oh-ohnd they played that song
At the Club Michelle it went on and on
Whoo-oo-oh-oh

At the Club Michelle everybody still dancing
Dancing to the music
Whoo-oo-oh-oh now I found that girl
Dancing at the Club Michelle

Whoo-oo-oh-ohnd they played that song
At the Club Michelle it went on and on
Whoo-oo-oh-oh
