Spring'll soon be gone (Wildwood days)
Summer's comin' on (Wildwood days)
And I'm-a dreamin' of (Wildwood days)
Lotsa summer love (bup-a-dup-a-dup-a-up)
And all I think about (Wildwood days)
After school is out (Wildwood days)
Headin' down the shore (Wildwood days)
To have a ball once more

Whoa whoa whoa whoa those Wildwood days
Wild, wild Wildwood days
Oh baby, every day's a holiday and every night is a Saturday night
Oh those Wildwood days, wild, wild Wildwood days
And then those party lights wild, wild Wildwood nights

Say baby you'll be mine (Wildwood days)
'cause it's kissin' time (Wildwood days)
Gonna twist again (Wildwood days)
Like remember when(dom-a-dom-a-dom-a-dom)
Sleepin 'on the beach (Wildwood days)
Seven days a week (Wildwood days)
Rockin' every night (Wildwood days)
'Till the early bright

Whoa whoa whoa whoa those Wildwood days
Wild, wild Wildwood days
My baby, every day's a holiday and every night is a Saturday night
Oh those Wildwood days, wild, wild Wildwood days
And then those party lights wild, wild Wildwood nights

Whoa whoa whoa whoa those Wildwood days
Wild, wild Wildwood days
Oh baby, every day's a holiday and every night is a Saturday night
Oh those Wildwood days, wild, wild Wildwood days
And then those party nights
