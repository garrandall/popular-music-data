I don't want a valentine, I just want Valentino
I just want the neck, I poke her face like a casino
Deep throat, know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed
I don't want a valentine, I just want Valentino
I just want the neck, I poke her face like a casino
Deep throat, know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed



I fuck her long, ain't no Minute Maid, my diamonds lemonade
Flexin' hard, call me Popeye, wallet filled with spinach, ayy
Cut you off on the interstate, I'm first to finish, ayy
I'm a young, rich nigga, bitch, it's always been that way
To the grave, might just be tomorrow, might just be today
So I always live it up, we poppin' bottles, poppin' K's
Gucci shades from my bougie bitch, I ain't even had to pay
Had to put on for the team and had to put on for the Bay
I'm still fly when I wear Robin's wings, I can't stay in one place
Russian Creams in my rocket ship, we go to outer space
Mask off, mask on, fuck it, I can't catch a case
Blast off, blast off, see the stars up in the Wraith
You can't get into the crib because the mansion got a gate
You can't come into my section, I'm gon' put you into place
If your club goin' up, you bet I'm sliding like it's chess
And I think I fell in love, she shook that ass up in my face


I don't want a valentine, I just want Valentino
I just want the neck, I poke her face like a casino
Deep throat, know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed
I don't want a valentine, I just want Valentino
I just want the neck, I poke her face like a casino
Deep throat, know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed


She just can't seem to keep her knees closed
She just can't seem to keep her knees closed


⁠⁠I don't want a valentine, I just want Valentino
I just want the neck, I poke her face like a casino
Deep throat, know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed
I don't want a valentine, I just want Valentino
I just want the neck, I poke her face like a casino
Deep throat, know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed
