There's no one for me but you
Believe me (believe me)
I'll give all my love to you
Believe me (believe me)


Cross my heart and I hope to die
I won't change as the time goes by
My love will grow, just don't you
Go and leave me (leave me)

I feel so good whenever
You are near me (near me)
I pray that you will stay
Forever near me (near me)



Don't lemme down, don't go
Don't play games with my heart
Please say that you won't go
'Cause I couldn't stand it
If we were apart

Oh, the things you do are all
The things that please me (please me)
I hope you'll always be the one
That needs me (needs me)



Cross my heart and I hope to die
I cross my heart, I won't make you cry
Cross my heart and I hope to die
Cross my heart, I won't say goodbye
