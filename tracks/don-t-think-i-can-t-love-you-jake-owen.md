I learned the hard way real early in life
That money sure don't grow on a tree
And there's a few things that a dollar can't buy
The best things in life, they come free

So girl I can't buy you a big diamond ring
No house on a hill full of life's finer things
And I'll tell you right now there's a whole lot that I just can't do
Oh, but baby don't think I can't love you

And when I get home after workin' all day
I'm beat down girl, I'm dead on my feet
But as tired as I am if you wanna play
Well, playin' sounds real good to me

'Cause girl I can't buy you a big diamond ring
No house on a hill full of life's finer things
And I'll tell you right now there's a whole lot that I just can't do
Oh, but baby don't think I can't love you

So girl I can't buy you a big diamond ring
No house on a hill full of life's finer things
And I'll tell you right now there's a whole lot that I just can't do
Oh, but baby, baby, oh baby don't think I can't love you
