Imagine seeing him on the town
Holding another hand
She's starin' me down,
So I figure that he told her who I am.
But it don't matter either way,
What they do or say cause ain't nothin' changed.
He's standing with her, but his soul is calling out my name.

In my mind, I'll always be his lady.
In my mind, I'll always be his girl.

Saw his momma just the other day,
Said he'd been through a spell.
Had a bad break up, thinks he's on his way up, it's hard to tell.
She said I think it'd do some good if you called him every now and then.
You see he's been through some things and I'm thinking he could really use a friend.

In my mind, I'll always be his lady.
In my mind, I'll always be his girl.
Only time can tell if I'm his lady.
But in my mind, I'll always be his girl.

They say if you love something, you've got to let it go.
And if it comes back, then it means so much more.
But if it never does, at least you will know,
That it was something you had to go through to grow.

In my mind, I'll always be his lady.
In my mind, I'll always be his girl.
Only time will tell if I'm his lady.
But in my mind, I'll always be his girl.

Always feel this way about ya,
Always be your lady,
In my heart, in my mind.
In my heart, in my mind.
In my soul, in my mind.
Baby you should know,
You're in my thoughts, in my mind.
You're in my prayers, in my mind.
I'll always keep you there.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
