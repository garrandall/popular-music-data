I'm still tracing over lines that you used on me
I should forget but I can't shake the memory
In the dead of night, dreams come alive
How you left me alone and pushed me aside
Nothing I could do to try and make you see
And make up your mind
Make up your mind
My heart is pumpin' for information
Did you plan your moves on me?
Somewhere, some how, some time
You're gonna realize
Just what you mean to me
I tracked you down like a hunter
Breaking you under my spell
Lust- like thunder, callin' out your name
In the heat of the night dreams come alive
How you left me alone and pushed me aside
Nothin' I could do to try and make you see
Make up your mind
My heart is pumpin' for information
Did you plan your moves on me?
Somewhere, somehow, some time
You're gonna realize
Just what you mean to me

In the heat of the night
Dreams come alive
How you left me alone
And pushed me aside
Nothin' I could do to try and make you see
Make up your mind
Make up your mind

Baby my heart is pumpin' for information
Did you plan your moves on me?
Somewhere, somehow, some time
You're gonna realize
Just what you mean
What you do what you do

Baby my heart is pumpin' for information
Did you plan your moves on me?
Somewhere, somehow, some time
You're gonna realize
Just what you mean
What you do what you do
