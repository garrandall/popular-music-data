Ship to shore, do you read me anymore,
This line is bad, and fading,
Ship to shore, answer my call,
Send me a signal, a beacon to bring me home;
I have been to see the world,
tasted life at every turn,
And all the time,
Your face came back to haunt me;

Day by day the feeling grew,
I know I'm still in love with you,
The further that I go,
The more I know it, I wanna show it,
Ship to shore, do you read me anymore,
This line is bad, and fading,
Ship to shore, answer my call,
Send me a signal, a beacon to bring me home;
Moving fast, all systems go,
You and I had time to grow,
Before there was a breakdown in transmission;

How I wish that we could turn,
The clock back to the days when,
We were lovers in the true sense,
Of the meaning, you must believe me,
Ship to shore, do you read me anymore,
This line is bad, I'm drowning,
Ship to shore, answer my call,
Send me a signal, a beacon to bring me home;

Ship to shore, ship to shore, ship to shore...

I cannot believe my eyes,
But I think I see a light;
You are everything I've always,
Wanted in my life;
