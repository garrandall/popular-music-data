Brrrr, yeah (ew, ew, ew, EW! yeah)
It's over, uh huh (that's right)
Missy with the Preachers Son, uh huh (ok)
It's over (ok), I told ya (yeah)
J-CLEF, let's go (ew, WOO)
Brrrrr


(uh oh)
Yeah, hey yo Clef (oh)
( Uh huh)
Uh oh (uh oh), these motherfuckers ain't ready for
this shit (oh)
( Hey)


Me and Clef on this track what you want
Heard you wanna battle us both I hope you don't
Hand me my mic, two woofers in my trunk (huh)
Sound like gonk-ga-gonk-ga-gonk-ga-gonk-ga-ga-ga-gonk
(c'mon)
I drink that Dom Perignon (oh)
I drink that shot of Petron to turn me on (uh)
I got that red eye bomb, get you stoned (yeah)
I got them gunshots, head knock 'til my bed stop


Hey 
It goes, âMissy you hit me with the henny got me dizzy
like a lesbi
I heard you wear turtleneckses' to hide your hickies.â

I'm freaky, dickie, like Samantha âSex in the City'
Lookie, lookie here
I only came to party
Easy shorty, with one dance
I put you in a trance
Not a body experience
As time flies, we have fun
But I don't want it to pass
My total love gots you waiting like a whoop-lash
Hey 


I teach you what you want (oh yeah)
The things you need to know (oh yeah)
Come in and shut the door (yeah)
Lets get this party goin (uh huh)
Baby let me show you, how you can satisfy a girl needs
(oh yeah, c'mon, c'mon)


1,2,3,4
In the mornin, in the evenin
In the nighttime, gotta have it
It's a feelin I can't fight it
You got me speakin another language
 Bo habibi, Nishtage'a
It's official raise your glasses
Cause this party gonna go to Damascus


Its me turn
I'm Mr. International
Cause when I move, everybody moves (Causto mi la'more
mi das-mi-yor)
That's was French, if I missed ya
You want Spanish y'all
All my guys grab two ladies now (Mi alas amigos puedos
dos senorita yo)
(Japanese lib)
Freakin' in Japanese shooting in the West Indies
Its breaking down, go and fetch the wrench
I'm suddenly all Jewish
And tossin' it up at a Bar-mitz-pha






Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday, Sunday, gotta have it


W-Y to the Clef (c'mon)
Boy I keep it realer than the titties on my chest
(yeah)
"Milk does your body good," come on take a sip
Like , it taste good don't it
You's a fine dreadlock, come on get
How many times Missy crushed the very best?
How many bombs on my summer, Funk Flex? (uh)
As many times as Teddy Reilly said "yep, yep"
Did you get it?
I stays on your mind like a fitted (uh)
Like Diddy make you walk for cheesecakes to the city
(woo)
Rough chick, dirty jeans, ain't nothin pretty (uh)
Me and Clef steppin to the mic to get busy (c'mon)




(uh oh) Yeah, hey yo Clef
(uh oh) Uh oh


What's up Missy (uh oh)
You know I love ya girl (oh)
What's up Missy
Let's go (uh)
I got the guitar soundin like a satar
Holy, holy, Jerry Wonder I need some security
Call police
