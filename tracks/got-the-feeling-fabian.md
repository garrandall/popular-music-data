(Got the feeling, got the feeling, ah)
(Got the feeling, got the feeling, ah)
When we were color bugging cheek to cheek
I get dizzy and my knees get weak
My pulse quivers every time we touch
Man, I'm shaking like it's just too much

(CHORUS)
Yeah, yeah, I've got the feeling, uh huh
Oh, oh, I've got the feeling, uh huh
Got the feeling, got the feeling
And when you tell that you're mine, all mine
I feel the fingers picking at my spine
I get the heebie geebies on my brain
And I'm-a hurting with a crazy pain

(CHORUS)
And when you kiss me, baby, it's the most
You start me burning like piece of toast
You know your ma tells me you're still a child
She don't know how you drive me wild, yeah
Got the feeling I'm in love with you
Got the feeling that you love me too
My heart's hoping for something close like this
Come on, pretty baby, with another kiss

(CHORUS)
And when you kiss me, baby, it's the most
You start me burning like piece of toast
You know your ma tells me you're still a child
She don't know how you drive me wild, yeah
Got the feeling I'm in love with you
Got the feeling that you love me too
My heart's hoping for something close like this
Come on, pretty baby, with another kiss

(CHORUS)
