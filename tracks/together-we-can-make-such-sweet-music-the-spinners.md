Ho, why should you go to the left?
Why should I go to the right?
Why must we argue this way?
Why must we fuss and fight?


Oh, together we can make such sweet music
Together we can make it right
Oh, together we can make such sweet music
Together we can make it right, mmm, mmm


Now when you're feelin' bad, I am feelin' it too
Whatever your dreams are, I'll share them with you
Till life has ended, I'll stay by your side
You are my sunshine and you are my pride


Oh, together we can make such sweet music
Together we can make it right
Whoa, whoa, together we can make such sweet music
Together we can make it right, oh oh


Whoa, whoa, I know the love we share is locked in our hearts
And there is nothing that can tear us apart
Wherever you are that's where I'll be
I'll keep this love that you've given to me


Whoa, together we can make such sweet music
Together we can make it right
Whoa, whoa, together we can make such sweet music
Together we can make it right
