Well you're dirty and sweet
Clad in black don't look back and I love you
You're dirty and sweet, oh yeah
Well you're slim and you're weak
You've got the teeth of the hydra upon you
You're dirty sweet and you're my girl


Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on


Well you're built like a car
You've got a hubcap diamond star halo
You're built like a car, oh yeah
Well you're an untamed youth
That's the truth with your cloak full of eagles
You're dirty sweet and you're my girl


Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on


Well you're windy and wild
You've got the blues in your shoes and your stockings
You're windy and wild, oh yeah
Well you're built like a car
You've got a hubcap diamond star halo
You're dirty sweet and you're my girl


Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on


Well you're dirty and sweet
Clad in black, don't look back and I love you
You're dirty and sweet, oh yeah
Well you dance when you walk
So let's dance, take a chance, understand me
You're dirty sweet and you're my girl


Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on (ow)
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on (ow - get it on - mh)
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on (a-a-a-a)
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Take me, for a meanwhile I'm still thinking
