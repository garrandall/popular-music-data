I'm reminiscing on all the times we shared
I can't seem to forget the times that we spent
And I miss your pretty smile just seemed to brighten up my day
I want you here with me, I'm callin' out your name


Hear me, my pretty girl, you're on my mind
I want to hold in my arms
Tonight, let's make it right
Unless we're face to face you can't relate to what I have to say


I'm not a fool
Please don't break my heart
I'm daydreamin' about you and I need you in my life
I'm not a fool
Please don't break my heart
Please don't break my, don't break my heart


I'm sitting in my window
Watching cars go by
And hoping that one
You will be inside and I


I want you here with me
No explanation goes
You moved away and said
You be there for sure


No, no my baby girl
I want to hold you in my arms
Tonight, let's make it right
Unless we're face to face you can't relate to what I have to say


I'm not a fool
Please don't break my heart
I'm daydreamin' about you and I want you in my life
I'm not a fool
Please don't break my heart
Don't break my heart, don't break my heart
I want you in my life, baby


And babe, I want to hold you
In my arms
Tonight, let's make it right
Unless we're face to face you can't relate to what I have to say


I'm not a fool
Please don't break my heart
I want you in my life
I'm not a fool
Please don't break my heart
I want you in my back
I want you in my back here with me on my side
I need you in my life, my life
I want you by my side, my side
I need you in my life
I want you by my side, my side
I need you in my life, my life
I want you by my side, please come back
