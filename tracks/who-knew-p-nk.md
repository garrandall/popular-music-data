You took my hand, you showed me how
You promised me you'd be around
Uh-huh, that's right
I took your words and I believed
In everything you said to me
Yeah-huh, that's right


If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
'Cause they're all wrong
I know better, 'cause you said forever
And ever, who knew?


Remember when we were such fools
And so convinced and just too cool
Oh no, no no
I wish I could touch you again
I wish I could still call you friend
I'd give anything


When someone said count your blessings now
'Fore they're long gone
I guess I just didn't know how
I was all wrong
They knew better, still you said forever
And ever, who knew?


Yeah, yeah
I'll keep you locked in my head
Until we meet again
Until we, until we meet again
And I won't forget you my friend
What happened?


If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
'Cause they're all wrong and


That last kiss, I'll cherish, until we meet again
And time makes it harder, I wish I could remember
But I keep your memory, you visit me in my sleep
My darling, who knew?
My darling, my darling, who knew?
My darling, I miss you
My darling, who knew?
Who knew?
