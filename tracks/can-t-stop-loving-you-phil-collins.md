So you're leaving in the morning on the early train
I could say everything's alright
And I could pretend and say goodbye
Got your ticket
Got your suitcase
Got your leaving smile
I could say that's the way it goes
And I could pretend and you won't know
That I was lying


'Cause I can't stop loving you
No, I can't stop loving you
No, I won't stop loving you
Why should I?


We took a taxi to the station, not a word was said
And I saw you walk across the road
For maybe the last time I don't know
Feeling humble
I heard a rumble
On the railway track
And when I hear that whistle blow
I'll walk away and you won't know
That I'll be crying


'Cause I can't stop loving you
No, I can't stop loving you
No, I won't stop loving you
Why should I?


(Even try) I'll always be here by your side
(Why, why, why) I never wanted to say goodbye
(Why even try) I'm always here if you change, change your mind


So you're leaving in the morning on the early train
I could say everything's alright
And I could pretend and say goodbye
But that would be lying


'Cause I can't stop loving you
No, I can't stop loving you
No, I won't stop loving you
Why should I?
