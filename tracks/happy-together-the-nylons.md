Imagine me and you, I do
I think about you day and night, it's only right
To think about the girl you love and hold her tight
So happy together

If I should call you up, invest a dime
And you'd say you belong to me, I'd lose my mind
Imagine how the world could be so very fine
So happy together

I can't see me lovin' nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me, baby the skies will be blue
For all my life

Me and you, and you and me
No matter how they toss the dice, it had to be
The only one for me is you, and you for me
So happy together

I can't see me lovin' nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me, baby the skies will be blue
For all my life

Me and you, and you and me
No matter how they toss the dice, it had to be
The only one for me is you, and you for me
So happy together

Me and you, and you and me
No matter how they toss the dice, it had to be
The only one for me is you, and you for me
So happy together
