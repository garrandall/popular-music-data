Scotch and soda
Mud in your eye
Baby do I feel high
Oh me, oh my do I feel high (so high)

Dry martini, jigger of gin
Oh what a spell you've got me in
Oh my, do I feel high

People don't believe me
They think that I'm just braggin'
But I could feel the way I feel
And still be on the wagon

All I need is one of your smiles
Sunshine of your eyes
Oh me, oh my do I feel higher than a kite can fly
Give me lovin', 'cause I feel so high

People don't believe me
They think that I'm just braggin'
But I could feel the way I feel
And still be on the wagon (on the wagon)

All I need is one of your smiles (all I need is your smile)
Sunshine of your eyes
Oh me, oh my do I feel higher than a kite can fly
Give me lovin' (lovin')
'Cause I feel so high
