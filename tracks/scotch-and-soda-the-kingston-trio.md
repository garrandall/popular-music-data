Scotch and Soda
Mud in yer eye
Baby do I feel high oh me oh my
Do I feel high

Dry martini
Jigger of gin
Oh what a spell you've got me in, oh my
Do I feel high

People won't believe me
They'll think that I'm just braggin'
But I could feel the way I do
And still be on the wagon

All I need is one of your smiles
Sunshine of your eye oh me oh my
Do I feel higher than a kite can fly
Give me lovin' baby I feel high

People won't believe me
They'll think that I'm just braggin'
But I could feel the way I do
And still be on the wagon

All I need is one of your smiles
Sunshine of your eye oh me oh my
Do I feel higher than a kite can fly
Give me lovin' baby I feel high
