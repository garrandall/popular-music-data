Oh...
Time was, time was

Time was when we had fun
On the schoolyard swings
When we exchanged graduation rings
One lovely yesterday
(Yesterday, yesterday)

Time was when we wrote
Love letters in the sand
Or lingered over our coffee and
Dreaming the time away
(The time away)

Picnics and hayrides
And midwinter sleigh rides
And never apart

High hikes in the country
And there's more than one tree
On which I've a place
In your heart

Darling, every tomorrow
Will be complete
If all our moments
Are half as sweet
As all our time was then

As all our time was
All our time was then
