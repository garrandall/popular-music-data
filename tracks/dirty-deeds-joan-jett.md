If you're havin' trouble with the high school head
He's givin' you the blues
You wanna graduate but not in his bed
Here's what you gotta do
Pick up the phone
I'm always home
Call me anytime
Just ring three sixty two four three five o
I lead a life of crime

Dirty deeds done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds done dirt cheap

If you got a lady and you want her gone
But you ain't got the guts
She keeps on naggin' at you night and day
Enough to drive you nuts
Pick up the phone
And leave her alone
It's time you made a stand
For a fee I'm happy to play
Your night time plan

Dirty deeds done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds done dirt cheap

Done dirt cheap
Done dirt cheap
Done dirt cheap
Done dirt cheap
