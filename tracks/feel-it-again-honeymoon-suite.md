If you would just be sensible
You'd find me indispensable
I pray deep down to destiny
That places you with me

Whoa, wanting you here in the sheets
Wandering around incomplete
Waiting so long

To feel it again
I thought that this heart would never mend
To feel it again, I know it is the living end
To feel it again (to feel it again)
I thought that this heart would never mend
To feel it again, I know it is the living end

Another scratched or scribbled note
To handsome men in overcoat
Deception right in front of me
A jealous fantasy

Whoa, something that sets you apart
Tightens your grip on my heart
Don't ever let it go 

Till I feel it again
I thought that this heart would never mend
To feel it again, I know it is the living end
To feel it again (to feel it again)
I thought that this heart would never mend
To feel it again, I know it is the living end

All that I know (to feel it again)
Is people will come and people will go
I don't really care (to feel it again)
As long as you're there
As long as you're there

To feel it again (to feel it again)
I thought that this heart would never mend
To feel it again, I know it is the living end
To feel it again (to feel it again)
I thought that this heart would never mend
To feel it again, I know it is the living end

To feel it again (to feel it again)
I thought that this heart would never mend
To feel it again, I know it is the living end
