I just wanna tell the truth, man 
I just wanna tell the truth, man 
I just wanna tell the truth, man 
I just wanna tell the truth, man 

You're so fly, you're so high
Everybody around you trying to figure out why
You're so cool, you win all the time
Everywhere you go, man, you get a lot of shine

Boy like a magnet. Better yet a habit
Everything you wear people say they gotta have it
From the sweat suit to the white tee to the Gucci
You can probably say people wanna get like me

But what they don't know is when you go home
And get behind closed doors, man, you hit the floor
And what they can't see is your on your knees
So the next time you get it just tell 'em

It's the God in me 

You think I'm so fresh
You think I'm so clean
You think I'm so sweet
It's the God in me
What is it, you think, you see?
It's the God in me

You see her style, you think she nice
You look at her whip, you say the whip tight
You look at her crib, you're thinkin' she paid
You look at her life, you think she got it made

But everything she got the girl's been given
She call it a blessing, but you call it living
When it come to money she can be a hero
She writes them cheques with a whole lot of zeros

But what you don't know is when she get home
And get behind closed doors, man, she hit the floor
And what you can't see is she on her knees
And if you ask her she'll tell you

It's the God in me 

You think I'm so fresh
You think I'm so clean
You think I'm so sweet
It's the God in me

It's the God in me
What is it, you think, you see?
It's the God in me

What is it, you think, you see
When you see me, you see me?
You don't know how much I pray
Don't know how much I gave
Don't know how much I changed
I'm just tryna explain

It's the God in me 

You think I'm so fresh
You think I'm so clean
You think I'm so sweet
It's the God in me

What is it, you think, you see?
It's the God in me

It's the God in me
God in me

You think I'm so fresh
My God
You think I'm so clean
My God
You think I'm so sweet
It's the God in me
