Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna be...

Do me a favor, pick me up, take me out later
Don't worry about no paper
'Cause I got much stacked up for nights like this
My life can get crazy, I deal with shit on the daily
But baby, I'm thinking maybe
We could agree to work it out like this

I need you (you, oh) to give me your time (give me your time)
I need you (you, oh) to not wanna be mine

Are you down to be a distraction, baby?
But don't distract me, let me ask you, baby
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna be
A distraction, baby?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna be
Yeah, yeah
Are you down to be a distraction, baby?
But don't distract me, let me ask you, baby
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna be
A distraction, baby?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna be

I need you to respect it, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sometimes this shit get me stressing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So I need you with me to keep me right and keep me up all night
We can get faded
This life can make you so jaded
So we can stay shaded just to us and try to get it right, oh

I need you (you, oh) to give me your time (give me your time)
I need you (you, oh) to not wanna be mine

Are you down to be a distraction, baby?
But don't distract me, let me ask you, baby
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna be
A distraction, baby?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna be
Yeah, yeah
Are you down to be a distraction, baby?
But don't distract me, let me ask you, baby
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna be
A distraction, baby?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna be

I can't say I give my all
But tonight, I'd risk it all
Woah, woah, woah
Are you down to be...

Are you down to be a distraction, baby?
But don't distract me, let me ask you, baby
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna be
A distraction, baby?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna be
Yeah, yeah
Are you down to be a distraction, baby?
But don't distract me, let me ask you, baby
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna be
A distraction, baby?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna be
