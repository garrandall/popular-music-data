The big cold city was such a lonely place to be
Hustle all day and dream of the islands and sea
Millions of girls but none of them seemed right for me
'Till you came along and you touched me and set me free

So we slipped away last night eased on down to the Keys
Flying so high we hitched a ride on a Gulf Stream breeze
Living on love and the fruits from tropical trees
With a song in our hearts and our eyes on the West Indies

It's just another day in paradise
Loving the night away till the sunrise
Seeing that "I love you" look in your eyes
It's just another day in paradise

A bottle rum listen to the steel drum band
Laughing in the moonlight along the beach we ran
Splashing naked in the sea making love upon the sand
Falling fast asleep like children hand in hand

It's just another day in paradise
Loving the night away till the sunrise
Seeing that "I love you" look in your eyes
It's just another day in paradise

I woke up this morning with the sunlight in my eyes
Guess it was only a dream I hear the city outside
But I look at you sleeping and honey now I realize
That anywhere with you is paradise

It's just another day in paradise
Loving the night away till the sunrise
Seeing that "I love you" look in your eyes
It's just another day in paradise
