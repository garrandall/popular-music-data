Got my headlights off, we're sittin' outside
If you cry in my car, then we're here all night, oh
A couple blunts rolled and I got my windows down
Shorty, it's been a while since you've been this high

If you're waitin' on love, then you waitin' for a while
If the neighbors wake up, then we gotta turn it down
So you say I'm the type you like keepin' around
You like keepin' around

Late at night, eleven, we're cruisin'
Lately I've been watchin' your movements
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?
Late at night, eleven, we're crusin'
Lately I've been watchin' your movements
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?

Twenty-one, sittin' on my M5 (Yeah)
Ride around summer, all-wheel-drive, yeah
Couple blunts in and I got my windows down
Lookin' real nice in my passenger side

If you're waitin' on love, then you waitin' for a while
If the neighbors wake up, then we gotta turn it down
So you say I'm the type you like keepin' around
You like keepin' around

Late at night, eleven, we're cruisin'
Lately, I've been watchin' your movements
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?
Late at night, eleven, we're cruisin'
Lately, I've been watchin' your movements
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?

Oh, don't you forget about me
Oh, don't you forget about me
Oh, don't you forget about me
Oh, don't forget about me
Oh, don't you forget about me
Oh, don't forget about me, yeah
Oh, don't you forget about me
Oh, don't you forget about me

Late at night, eleven, we're cruisin'
(Lately I've been watchin' your, watchin' your)
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?

Don't you forget about me
If I'm the only one that you're
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin', usin'?
If I'm the only one that you're
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin', usin'?
Don't you forget about me
If I'm the only one that you're
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin', usin'?
If I'm the only one that you're
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin', usin'?
