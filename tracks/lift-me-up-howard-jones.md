I've got your picture in the palm of my hand
And I'm squeezin' it I'm teasin' it
I'd follow you to the edge of this land
But I'm losin' it, confusin' it

This is a man who has lost control
Lost the road to a higher soul
Stop me from fallin' you know I need you

To lift me up
Won't you lift me up yeah
Won't you take me to a place that I once knew
And when you can see
You've always been there for me
I'm waiting for your love

There'll be a time when all our rhythms of love
Are shakin' it we're makin' it
There'll be a place where life is livin' to give
This harmony it will come to me

And when I think of those who love you now
If I had my chances again somehow
Stop me from fallin' you know I need you
To lift me up
Won't you lift me up yeah
Won't you take me to a place that I once knew
And when you can see
Another side of me
I'm waiting for you

I'm not eating I'm not sleeping this tension this worry
You don't call you don't write me
I need your love in a hurry
Teach me, Reach me, Meet me, Beat me,
Tease me, Please me,
Come and seize me

This is a man who has lost control
Lost the road to a higher soul
Catch me from fallin' you know I need you

To lift me up
Won't you lift me up yeah
Won't you take me to a place that I once knew
And when you can see
You've always been there for me
I'm waiting for your love
And when you can see
The changes I've made in me
Well I'm waitin' for, you know I'm waitin' for your love
