Sunrise, shine down a little love
On the world today
Make a morning so sweet
That it'll have to chase my blues away
Oh, the moon and stars have gone
And I can see the light of dawn
Like a golden smile
Brightening up the brand new day

Sunrise, come wrap me in the warmth
Of your crimson sky
I spent a long time believin'
In a dream that had passed me by
But the moon and stars have gone
And I can see the light of dawn
Like a golden smile
Brightening up the morning sky

From my bed I can hear the world outside
I get up, throw my window open wide
Take a breath of that fresh air
Take a breath of that fresh air
Fresh air

Sunrise, shine down a little love
On the world today
Make a morning so sweet
That it'll have to chase my blues away
Oh, the moon and stars have gone
And I can see the light of dawn
Like a golden smile
Brightening up the brand new day
Brand new day
