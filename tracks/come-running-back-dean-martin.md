(Come running back)
If you find your new love isn't what you thought it would be
If your nights are lonely now and you need more sympathy
Baby, come running back to me
Come running back to me
Back to the arms that long to hold you forever and ever

If you find his lips don't thrill you like mine used to do
And you see me smiling at you when he's holding you
Baby, come running back to me
Come running back to me
Back to the arms that long to hold you forever and ever

If you realize that you were wrong to say goodbye
Don't allow your foolish pride to let true love go by
Baby, come running back to me
Come running back to me
Back to the arms that long to hold your forever and ever my love
Come running back
(Come running back)
Come running back
(Come running back)
Come running back
