Call up, ring once, hang up the phone.
To let me know you made it home.
Don't want nothing to be wrong with part-time lover.

If she's with me I'll blink the lights.
To let you know tonight's the night.
For me and you my part-time lover.

We are undercover passions on the run,
Chasing love up against the sun.
We are strangers by day, lovers by night.
Knowing it's so wrong, feeling so right.

If I'm with friends and we should meet.
Just pass me by, don't even speak.
Know the word's "discreet" when part-time lovers.

But if there's some emergency.
Have a male friend to ask for me.
Then she won't seem to be my part-time lover.

We are undercover passions on the run,
Chasing love up against the sun.
We are strangers by day, lovers by night.
Knowing it's so wrong, feeling so right.

I've got something that I should tell.
Last night someone rang our doorbell.
It was not you, part-time lover.

And then a man called our exchange.
But did not want to leave gis name.
Two can play the game of part-time lovers.

We are undercover passions on the run.
Chasing love up against the sun.
We are strangers by day, lovers by night.
Knowing it's so wrong, feeling so right.
