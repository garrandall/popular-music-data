They say we sail tonight
And we may have to fight
I want with all my
Might to stay

But I'll go for God
Country, and my baby
You know I have to go
And, dear, I'll miss you so

For God, country and my baby
Please write me every day
Every day that I'm away

And though I'll be
Alone across the Rhine
I'll dream about you, dear
And know you're mine

And if I ever need you
I'll close my eyes and see you
Your lips, your kiss
I'll need them so

I'll go for God
Country, and my baby
Sure as these teardrops burn
I promise to return

And when I'm home
I'll cling to the
Arms of my baby
And when I'm home
I'll stay in the
Arms of my baby
