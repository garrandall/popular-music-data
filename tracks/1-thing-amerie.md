Na, na, na, na, na, oh
Na, na, na, na, na, oh
Na, na, na, na, na, oh
Na, na, na, na, na


Oh, been trying to let it go
Trying to keep my eyes closed
Trying to keep it just like before
The times we never even thought to speak
Don’t wanna tell you what it is
Oh wee it felt so serious
Got me thinking just too much
I wanna set it off, but


It's this one thing that’s got me trippin'
It's this one thing that's got me trippin' (You did)
This one thing my soul may be feelin'
It's this one thing you did oh oh
It's this one thing that caught me slippin'
It's this one thing I want to admit it (you did)
This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did oh oh


Hey, we don’t know each other well
So why I keep picking up my cell?
Memories just keep ringing bells
Oh oh, oh oh, oh
Hear voices I don’t want to understand
My car keys are jingling in my hand
My high heels are clicking towards your door
Oh oh, oh oh, oh


It's this one thing that’s got me trippin'
It's this one thing that's got me trippin' (You did)
This one thing my soul may be feelin'
It's this one thing you did oh oh
It's this one thing that caught me slippin'
It's this one thing I want to admit it (you did)
This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did oh oh


Maybe I just can’t believe it
It’s this one thing you did oh oh
I can’t deny, tired of trying
Nothing left to do but to keep on seeing you
I’m hoping you can keep a secret
For me, for me, for me
But what you did, yeah


It's this one thing that’s got me trippin'
It's this one thing that's got me trippin' (You did)
This one thing my soul may be feelin'
It's this one thing you did oh oh
It's this one thing that caught me slippin'
It's this one thing I want to admit it (you did)
This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did oh oh


Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Na, na, na, na, na, oh, oh
Na, na, na, na, na, oh
Na, na, na, na, na, oh
Na, na, na, na, na, oh
Na, na, na, na, na


It's this one thing that's got me trippin'
It's this one thing that's got me trippin' (You did)
This one thing my soul may be feelin'
It's this one thing you did oh oh
It's this one thing that caught me slippin'
It’s this one thing I want to admit it (You did)
This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did oh oh
It's this one thing that's got me trippin'
It's this one thing that's got me trippin' (you did)
This one thing my soul may be feelin'
It's this one thing you did oh oh
It's this one thing that caught me slippin'
It's this one thing I want to admit it (you did)
This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did oh oh
