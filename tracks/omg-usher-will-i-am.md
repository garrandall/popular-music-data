Oh, my gosh
Baby let me
I did it again, so I'mma let the beat drop
Oh, my

Baby let me love you down
There's so many ways to love ya
Baby I can break you down
There's so many ways to love ya
Got me like, "Oh, my gosh. I'm so in love."
I found you finally, you make me wanna say
Oh, oh , oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, my gosh

You make me wanna say
Oh, oh , oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I fell in love with shorty when I seen her on the dance floor
She was dancing sexy, pop, pop, popping, dropping, dropping low
Never ever has a lady hit me on the first sight
This was something special; this was just like dynamite

Honey got a booty like pow, pow, pow
Honey got some boobies like wow, oh wow
Girl you know I'm loving yourâloving your style
Check, check, check, check, check, checking you out like
Oh (oh) she got it all
Sexy from her head to toe
And I want it all, it all, it all

Baby let me love you down
There's so many ways to love ya
Baby I can break you down
There's so many ways to love ya

Got me like, "Oh, my gosh. I'm so in love."
I found you finally, you make me wanna say
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, my gosh

You make me wanna say
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You make me wanna say
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


Feel so hard for honey out of all the girls up in this club
This one got me whipped, just off one look, yep I fell in love
This one something special, this one just like dynamite
You're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're out of sight

Fell in love with honey like my, oh my
Honey looking wonderful; fly, so fly
Honey like a supermodel; my, oh my
Baby, how you do that make a grown man cry?

Oh (oh) baby, you got it all
Sexy from her head to the toe
And I want it all, it all, it all

So, honey let me love you down
There's so many ways to love ya
Baby, I can break it down
There's so many ways to love ya

Got me like, "Oh, my gosh. I'm so in love."
I found you finally, you make me wanna say
Oh, oh , oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, my gosh!

Oh, my gosh
Oh, my
Oh, my
Oh, oh, my gosh


Oh, my gosh
I did it again
So I'mma let the beat drop


Oh, oh, oh, my
Oh, oh, oh, my, my, my, my, my, my
Oh, my gosh 
Oh, oh, oh, my
Oh, oh, oh, my, my, my, my, my, my
Oh, my gosh
