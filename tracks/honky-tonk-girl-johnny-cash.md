Don't be fool by big blue eyes by a smile or a golden curl
'Cause she'll love you now and then break every vow
'Cause she's just a honky tonk girl

Breaking hearts to her is just the way of having fun
She thinks every man's a fool and you're another one
She knows all the arts of love she'll give your heart a twirl
'Cause she's just a honky tonk girl

She can never change your ways though you'll give her all the world
She's had more than one or two and each day there's someone new
'Cause she's just a honky tonk girl

Breaking hearts to her is just the way of having fun
She thinks every man's a fool and you're another one
She knows all the arts of love she'll give your heart a twirl
'Cause she's just a honky tonk girl
