Thank you and goodnight
Thank you and goodnight
Thank you and goodnight
Thank you and goodnight

Thank you for showing
Me a wonderful time
Gee, everything just
Turned out so fine

So thank you and goodnight
Thank you and goodnight
Thank you and goodnight

Funny, the hours seemed
To go by so fast
I hope that this time
Won't be the last
I want to see you again
(See you again)

I never felt this way before
After a very first date
I never knew what
One kiss could do
Gee, but the feeling is great

Baby, it's getting late
And I've gotta go
Here's something that
You ought to know
I've had the time of my life
(Time of my life)

Thank you and good night
Thank you and goodnight
Thank you and goodnight...

Thank you, baby
I had a wonderful time
Thank you, baby
