You don't have to be beautiful to turn me on
I just need your body, baby, from dusk 'til dawn
You don't need experience to turn me out
You just leave it all up to me, I'm gonna show you what it's all about


You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kiss


You got to not talk dirty, baby, if you wanna impress me
You can't be too flirty, mama, I know how to undress me
I want to be your fantasy, maybe you could be mine
You just leave it all up to me, we could have a good time


You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kiss


Yes, oh, I think I wanna dance, uh
Gotta, gotta, oh
Little Girl Wendy's Parade
Gotta, gotta, gotta


Women, not girls, rule my world, I said they rule my world
Act your age, mama, not your shoe size, maybe we could do the twirl
You don't have to watch Dynasty to have an attitude
You just leave it all up to me, my love will be your food


You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm compatible with!
I just want your extra time and your kiss
