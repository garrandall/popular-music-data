If time were not a moving thing and I could make it stay this hour
The love we share will always be there'd be no coming day
To shine a morning light and make us realize all night it's over

When you walk away from me there is no place to put my hand
Except to shade my eyes against the sun that rises over land
I watch you walk away somehow I have to let you go now it's over

If you knew just how I really feel you might turn yet
There are so many times that people have to love and then forget
Though there might have been a way I have to force myself to say it's over

So I turn my back and turn my colar to the wind
Move along in silence trying not to think at all
I send my feet before me walk the silence street before me it's over

If time were not a moving thing...
