So mi go so weh mi juggle
Then wine gal cau yuh inna yuh prime

Har belly skin smooth and it nuh full up a line
Gal yuh round like a two pound kindly divide
Bounce a gal cau she nuh worth yuh time
She caan walk side deh yuh

When yuh, fuck up yuh bumpa

But anyman waan yuh dem haffi form a line

Di man dem a watch yuh like everyday
True dem know yuh body good
And yuh nuh give it away
So all di likkle fassy dem a road dem a stay
How dem a go stop yuh now?!

But dem gal deh yah fraud
Yuh nut clothes a yard
Yuh do yuh shoppin a broad
So all di likkle fassy dem a road dem a talk
How dem a go stop yuh now, girl

There gonna lead (HEY! HEY! HEY!)
Gal you a lead (HEY!) yes indeed (HEY!)
There gonna lead (HEY! HEY! HEY!)
