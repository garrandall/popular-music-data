You tripped me when I'm falling
You kick me when Iâm down
I think I missed my calling
I should have been a clown
How much more-
How much more can I stand
You're pouring water
On a drowning man (I like that)

You get me on the right track, baby
And then you run me down (Oh, yes, you do)
You stab me in the back (Trust, yeah)
Everytime I turn around
Criticizin' my loving
When Iâm doing all I can
You're pouring water
On a drowning man

You're pouring water on a drowning man
You treat me like the fool I am
You bragged that I'll take anything you do
Salt in my wound it's sad but it's true
You warm me with your kissin', baby
Then you leave me in the cold (Oh, yes, you do)
How can I know your wishes?
Yeah, hen I've never been told
Wonât you show a little mercy
Canât you understand?
You're pouring water
On a drowning man
Youâre pouring water
On a drowning man
Oh, yeah
