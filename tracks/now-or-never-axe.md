Terri said she
Didn't wanna go back
To the City of Angels no more
She had seen enough
Fallen angels to last a lifetime

I told her not to be bitter
Nothing ever stays the same
She knew all the time
I was lying
I could see her pain


She said she
Wants to go out tonight
And feel the warmth
Of these city lights
And wants the clock
To strike midnight forever

Terri said she
Didn't want to hold back
She wants to love me
All through the night
She wants to show me her
Darkest secrets by candlelight

Terri said she's
Gonna miss the old men
Drinking cheap wine
And sleeping in the park
Or hiding out underneath
The highway 'til after dark


She said because
It's our last night
She wants to break the rules
And that's alright with me
Cause I think it's now or never

Terri said she
Didn't wanna go back
To the City of Angels no more
She had seen enough
Fallen angels to last a lifetime


She said because
It's our last night
She wants to break the rules
And that's alright with me
Cause I think it's now or never


She said because
It's our last night
She wants to break the rules
And that's alright by me
Cause I think it's now or never
