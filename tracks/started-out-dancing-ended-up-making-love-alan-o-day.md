Yeah, all right, baby!

I can see her body
Pushing at her clothes
Dancing up a sweat now
And I wonder if she knows
That I want her so bad I'm in physical pain
My imagination taking over again

Started out dancing
Ended up making love
That's what I'm thinking of
Started out dancing
Ended up making love

Working to the rhythm
Looking in her eyes
Trying to send a message
Getting some replies
Feels like she's looking into my soul
Gotta look away just to keep control

Started out dancing
Ended up making love
That's what I'm thinking of
Started out dancing
Ended up making love

I wonder
Did she come alone
I wonder
Could I take her home
I wonder if she's looking for
Just a dance or a little bit more

Two us alone now
(I can see her body)
Doing what we feel
(Pushing at her clothes)
Dancing close together
(Dancing up a sweat now)
I can't believe it's real
(Wonder if she knows)

'Cause you were wanting me
While I was wanting you
It's sure good luck when a dream comes true

Started out dancing
Ended up making love
I can't get enough
Started out dancing
Ended up making love

Yeah, feels so good now, baby

Just a little bit more
I want her so bad
(Working to the rhythm)
(Looking in her eyes)
My imagination
(Trying to send a message)
Taking over again
(Getting some replies)

(Working to the rhythm)
Started out dancing
(Looking in her eyes)
Ended up making love

(Working to the rhythm)
(Looking in her eyes)
(Working to the rhythm)
Started out dancing
(Looking in her eyes)
Ended up making love
