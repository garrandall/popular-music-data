You know I feel so bad, children
Feel like a ballgame on a rainy day
Yes I do, yall

Don't you know I feel so bad, children
Oh Lord like a ballgame on a rainy day

Whoa since I lost my woman
You see I have to shake my head
And then I walk away
I have to walk away

Y'all listen to this

I just wanna tell you people
I wanna tell you just how I feel
Can you hear me now

I wanna tell all you people out there
I wanna tell you just how I feel
Oh, how I feel

I feel so bad, I feel so bad
Because my woman
She gave me a dirty deal
The child messed up my mind
Oh, yes, she did

Now listen y'all
I got one more thing
I want to talk to you about
Wait a minute

Sometimes I want to leave
This town, yes, I do
Then again I want to stay

You see, the thing is
I already got my suitcase packed up
So I guess I have to catch a train
And then I'll ride away

Said I'm gonna move
Gonna move on, gonna move on
Lord, I wanna move

Since the woman been gone
I ain't had no love
That's what I want
That's what I need

A little dab'll do me
Ooh sock it to me, Lord
Somebody help me
Help me find my way
