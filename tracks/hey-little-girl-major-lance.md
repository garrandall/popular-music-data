Hey little girl
(Hey little girl)
I watch you dance and you look so fine
Hey little girl
(Hey little girl)
You do the monkey, right on time

A please let me have a chance with you
For I like to do the monkey too

And let's get together
Let's get together right now
Let's get together, I need your company
Well count on me, a little girl, a little girl

The way you move you just thrill me so
Hey little girl
(Hey little girl)
I'm trying hard not to let myself go
But work out everything is all right
The way you move you just out of sight

And let's get together
Let's get together right now
Let's get together, I need your company
Well count on me, a little girl, a little girl

Can you do the twist
(A little girl)
Goes something like this
(A little girl)
Well how about the watusi yeah
(A little girl)
Work out and hang loosely

A please let me have a chance with you
For I like to do the monkey too

And let's get together
Let's get together right now
Let's get together, I need your company
Well count on me, a little girl, a little girl

I said you look so fine
(A little girl)
Well it's monkey time
(A little girl)
A can you can do the bird
(A little girl)
