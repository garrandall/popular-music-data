Inny Meeny Minny Mo
How Many Bitches From The Club Won't Go
(I Know You See It, I Know You See It)
I'm Like Inny Meeny Minny Mo
How Many Niggas From The Club Won't Go
(I Know You See It, I Know You See It)


Now You Can Call Me Tipdrill, They Playing My Song
Throw A Couple Ones, Then She Throw Away Her Thong
When She Bust It Open, Take A Picture With My Phone
She Love My Cologne, I Call It Perk Body Zone
Now She Pussy Poppin', It'S Goin' Down
Slap The Waitress On The Booty, Tell Her "Get Another Round"
And When I Make It Rain, Money All Over The Ground
Fresh Force Ones, Sean John Button Down
And Then I'm Like "Oh Boy, A Clique Fulla Stars"
Big Four Fifth, Big Dick, And Big Cars
At The End Of The Day, When It's All Said And Done
I Need Four Freaks 'Cause I Need More Than One


Inny Meeny Minny Mo
How Many Bitches From The Club Won't Go
(I Know You See It, I Know You See It)
I'm Like Bim Bam, I Know You Want Some
She Chewing On The Dick Like A Piece Of Bubble Yum
(I Know You See It, I Know You See It)


I'm Like Inny Meeny Minny Mo
How Many Niggas From The Club Won't Go
(I Know You See It, I Know You See It)
I'm Like Bim Bam, I Know You Want Some
You Chewing On The Pussy Like A Piece Of Bubble Yum
(I Know You See It, I Know You See It)


I Ain't Never Been The Type To Show Off In The Club
Real Laid Back Poppin' Plenty Bottles Of
Bub, Don't Smoke But I Got Much Perk
Get That Nigga Real High, Make Him Slurp It Then Burp
Could You Be A Groupie? I Hear You Singin' My Song
Like I See You, Lemme Feel Your Tongue
It's T, Miss B Nigga, Let Me Get You Laced
Take A Step Back, Blow The Pussy In Ya Face
I Ain't Talking Cush Nigga, I'm Talking A Rat Race
So Many To Choose From, Give 'Em All A Little Taste
Gotta House Fulla Pussy, The Madam Of Hip Hop
My Bitches Are Superstars, So Gushy You Needa Mop
Yea

I Got Stacks On Deck, Snowflakes On My Neck
New J'S On My Feet, Make My Outfit Complete
(I Know You See It, I Know You See It)
I Got Stacks On Deck, Niggas Love My Flow
Got A Mohawk Blowin', Air Forces That Glow
(I Know You See It, I Know You See It)
