You better stop and think what you're sayin'
You'd better hold on, make sure you're sold on
Letting me go (letting me go)
Make sure you know what you wanna surpass

You think because you're heart's flying high now
He won't pursue you, that he's gonna leave ya
Don't be mislead (don't be mislead)
Think with your head and not with your heart

Better use your head to hold on baby
Better turn around what you're sayin'
Better use your head before it's too late and I'm gone
Better use your head to help you
You will never find another love like me your whole life through
Hey baby, use your head, believe in me
Use your head and you will see
You won't be losin' it, so use your head

I know I'm not the one who should tell you
You think I'm lyin', you think I'm tryin'
Hard to hold on (hard to hold on)
Putting you on, fool with your mind

But he's been all over town tellin' people
He's gonna get you, he will not let you
Know where he's been (know where he's been)
Ready for you when he leaves you behind

Better use your head to hold on baby
Better turn around what you're sayin'
Better use your head before it's too late and I'm gone
Better use your head to help you
You will never find another love like me your whole life through
Hey baby, use your head, believe in me
Use your head and you will see
You won't be losin' it, so use your head

Why don't you use your head
Ah, I just wanna make you
Better turn around what you're sayin'
Better use your head before it's too late and I'm gone
Better use your head
