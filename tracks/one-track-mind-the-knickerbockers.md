There's no denyin' I've been cryin', yeah, without her
Somebody help me please, I can't forget about her

I've got a one track mind
Maybe I'm a stubborn fool
Somebody please
Tell me what to do

Don't try to tell me some girl will be taking her place
I close my eyes and all I visualize is her face

I've got a one-track mind
I won't believe that girl is gone
Somebody please
Tell me I'm not wrong

I can see her by my side
But the more I stare
Makes me want to run and hide
When I find she's not there

I've got a one-track mind
I won't believe that girl is gone
Somebody please
Tell me I'm not wrong

I can see her by my side
But the more I stare
Makes me want to run and hide
When I find she's not there

There's no denyin' I've been cryin', yeah, without her
Somebody help me please, I can't forget about her

I've got a one track mind
Maybe I'm a stubborn fool
Somebody please
Waaaaahhh!

I got a one track mind
One track mind
