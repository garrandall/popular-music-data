Well I know there's a reason
And I know there's a rhyme
We were meant to be together
That's why
We can roll with the punches
We can stroll hand in hand
And when I say it's forever
You understand

That you're always in my heart,
You're always on my mind
But when it all becomes too much,
You're never far behind
And there's no one that comes close to you
Could ever take your place
Cause only you can love me this way

I could have turned a different corner
I could have gone another place
Then I'd of never had this feeling
That I feel today, yeah..

And you're always in my heart,
Always on my mind
When it all becomes too much,
You're never far behind
And there's no one that comes close to you
Could ever take your place
Cause only you can love me this way

Oh...

And you're always in my heart,
You're always on my mind
And when it all becomes too much,
you're never far behind
And there's no one that comes close to you
Could ever take your place
Cause only you can love me this way

Oh...

Only you can love me this way.
