Two four six eight!
Who do we appreciate!
Igmoo! Igmoo! we love Igmoo!

With his jeans swung low
Hangin' on his hips
Last night's lipstick still upon his lips
Who makes the girls all do backover flips
Igmoo the pride, of South Central High
It's the morning class looking like a 'rangutan
Twelve minutes after the last bell has rang
The girls all sigh, "ain't he the cutest thing?"
Igmoo the pride, of South Central High

Then it's Saturday's big game
When the band begins to play
And the scores are all the same
Who's the guy that saves the day? (Igmoo!)
With his football suit hanging on his hips
Last night's lipstick still upon his lips
Who makes the girls all do backover flips
Igmoo, the pride of South Central High
