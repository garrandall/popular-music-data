Na na na na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na, na na na na na na


I guess I just lost my husband, I don't know where he went
So I'm gonna drink my money, I'm not gonna pay his rent (Nope!)
I got a brand new attitude and I'm gonna wear it tonight
I wanna get in trouble, I wanna start a fight
Na na na na na na na, I wanna start a fight
Na na na na na na na, I wanna start a fight


So, so what? I'm still a rockstar
I got my rock moves and I don't need you
And guess what? I'm havin' more fun
And now that we're done
I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright
I'm just fine and you're a tool
So, so what? I am a rockstar
I got my rock moves and I don't want you tonight


(Uh, check my flow, uh)
The waiter just took my table
And gave it to Jessica Simps (Shit!)
I guess I'll go sit with drum boy
At least he'll know how to hit (Oops!)
What if this song's on the radio?
Then somebody's gonna die
I'm gonna get in trouble
My ex will start a fight
Na na na na na na na, he's gonna start a fight (Huh!)
Na na na na na na na, we're all gonna get in a fight!


So, so what? I'm still a rockstar
I got my rock moves and I don't need you
And guess what? I'm havin' more fun
And now that we're done
I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright (I'm alright)
I'm just fine and you're a tool
So, so what? I am a rockstar
I got my rock moves and I don't want you tonight


You weren't there, you never were
You want it all, but that's not fair
I gave you life, I gave my all
You weren't there, you let me fall


So, so what? I'm still a rockstar
I got my rock moves and I don't need you
And guess what? I'm havin' more fun
And now that we're done (We're done)
I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright (I'm alright)
I'm just fine (I'm just fine) and you're a tool
So, so what? I am a rockstar (Oh)
I got my rock moves and I don't want you tonight
(I don't want you tonight)


No, no, no, no
I don't want you tonight
You weren't there
I'm gonna show you tonight (I'm gonna show you tonight)
I'm alright (I'm alright)
I'm just fine and you're a tool
So, so what? I am a rockstar
I got my rock moves and I don't want you tonight
(I don't want you tonight!)


Woohoo!
Ba da da da da da
