I could start dreamin' but it never ends
As long as you're gone we may as well pretend
I've been dreamin'
Straight from the heart

You say it's easy but who's to say
That we'd be able to keep it this way
But it's easier
Comin' straight from the heart

Give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make another start
You know I'll never go
As long as I know
It's comin' straight from the heart

I'll see you on the street some other time
And all our words would just fall out of line
While we're dreamin'
Straight from the heart

Give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make one more start
You know I'll never go
As long as I know
It's coming straight from the heart

Don't ever leave me darling

Straight from the heart
Tell me we can make one more start
You know I'll never go
As long as I know

You give it to me now straight from the heart
Tell me we can make one more start
You know I'll never go
As long as I know
It's coming straight from the heart

Give it to me oh no oh no straight from the heart
You know I'll never go
As long as I know
It's coming straight from the heart
