You can get crunk in the club
Roll wit your hood
Get stomped in the club
Or you could get buck in the club
Get fucked up in the club
Nigga we don't give a fuck
But you don't want no problem (Problem)
But you don't want no problem (Problem)
But you don't want no problem with me
Cuz BME we be 50 deep

You don't wanna be dead in the streets
Mouth full of blood and soul full of heat (Ooo)
Why you tryna act hard as hell
And you know damn well you don't wanna feel the shell
Nigga I been down by a lot
Gun to my head, pressed dead to the wall
I got big balls and bullets like baseballs
Split ya dome, put you straight, knock out all ya'll
Hell no them boys don't play
Straight nuts to ya face
Put your pistol away
And don't weed to my head
I pray for the folks in the club gettin scared
Got a problem with that



Hold em back, hold em back
Man fuck that nigga
Fuck that hold em back
Gotta push that nigga
Hold em back, hold em back
Push that nigga
Fuck that hold em back

Hey shawty it's on
Goddamnit it's on
Keep poppin in my face and get popped in the dome
Learn to rush mothafuckas
It's gonna hurt
If a nigga fall
That's when shit gets worse
The problem with you niggas is
You just talk too much
Man swang on a nigga and fuck his ass up
And you can walk on by with your nuts in a tub
I'll be your obliged if you really won't get crunk
In the A we don't play them games
We just stack and slang and load up them things
Gettin buck if you wanna and catch a bow
Keep your pretty ass gull, beat your ass, and take your hoe
