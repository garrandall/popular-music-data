Go ahead, lil mama
I can transform you
No, I can't dance but I can dance on you
Swizz on the beat
Chris move you feet
And, baby, I can transform your "him" to a "me"

I can change your life
Make it so new
Make you never wanna go back to the old you
Ciroc and lime. Give it a little time
And she gon' transform like Optimus Prime


Need a ride? I can range you up
Money? I can change you up
You can have your own
No longer be the passenger

Swag low? I'll build you up
Knees weak? I'll stand you up
Red lips, red dress.
Like 'em like a firetruck

What you need you can have that
My black card. They don't decline that
See potential in you
Let me mould that
I can transform you
I can transform you
Come on

I can, I can transform you
I can, I can transform you
Anything you want
I can, I can get it for you
You're my baby girl so you know I did it for you
I can transâI can transâI can transform you

Shoes? you got it got it
Bags? you got it got it
Cars? you got it got it
M-m-money you got it got it
I can, I can transform you
I can, I can transform you
Anything you want I can, I can get it for you


See it in the video
You can have it really though
Iced-out everything
Frigid like a eskimo
Wanna fly? We can go
Anywhere you wanna go
Jimmy Choos in Italy
Louie V in Tokyo

Something like Pinocchio
If you lie then I'm 'a grow
Wanna see me do it big
I can show you how it go
Take you from an amateur to being professional
I can have you swag-surfing

What you need you can have that
My black card. They don't decline that
See potential in you
Let me mould that
I can transform you
I can transform you

I can, I can transform you
I can, I can transform you
Anything you want
I can, I can get it for you
You're my baby girl so you know I did it for you
I can transâI can transâI can transform you

Shoes? You got it got it
Bags? You got it got it
Cars? You got it got it
M-m-money you got it got it

I can, I can transform you
I can, I can transform you
Anything you want I can, I can get it for you


OK
I can, I can transform you like a transformer
I can turn you from a human to a Carter
Take you off the bench
T-turn you to a starter
Then I take you home and put you on a charger

T-then my car transforms to a charter
And we could fly to wherever you ever thought of
I take you to where it's warmer
Then I gotta rip off your dress like a warm-up

But I'm just getting warmed-up
So tell you man he better get his Voltron up
I transform her to a Ducati
Then I transform me to a Bugatti

'Cause her form puts me in a trance
I transform smaller and she puts me in her pants
Swizz Swizz on the beat
Chris move you feet
And Weezy transform a good girl to a freak

I can, I can transform you
I can, I can transform you
Anything you want
I can, I can get it for you
You're my baby girl so you know I did it for you
I can transâI can transâI can transform you

Shoes? You got it got it
Bags? You got it got it
Cars? You got it got it
M-m-money you got it got it

I can, I can transform you
I can, I can transform you
Anything you want I can, I can get it for you
Chris
