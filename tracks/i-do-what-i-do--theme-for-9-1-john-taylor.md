I do what I do to
I do it all to have you
I do what I do to have you, have you
I do it all to have you

I do what I do to have you, have you
I do it all to have you
I do it all to have you
I do it all to have you...

Do you look the way
You wanted to look?
Do you feel the way
You wanted to feel?
Are you happy now
That we fantasize

I do what I do to have you, have you
I do it all to have you
I do what I do to have you, have you
I do it all to have you...

Do I touch the way
You want to be touched?
Have you heard the words
You wanted to hear?
Is my body heat
The right intensity?

I do what I do to have you, have you
I do it all to have you
I do it all to have you
I do it all to have you...

Do you look the way you wanted to look
Do you feel the way you wanted to feel
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?
I did what I did
I did what I did, did what I did...
Are you happy now?

I do what I do to have you, have you
I do it all to have you
I do what I do to have you, have you
I do it all to have you...
