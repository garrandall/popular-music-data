I love the way they look
When they give me the eyes
It drives me crazy
When they pass me by

My heart wants love
True, true love
It don't matter who
Cause I'm so blue

She can be a blonde
Or have brown hair too
Or even red
Any shade will do

I wanna girl to call my own
So I will never feel
So all alone

I'm gonna wait right here
Til that lucky day
I know I'm gonna find her
Oh, come what may

I just wanna girl to call my own
So I will never feel
So all alone

I see a pair of legs
Approaching me
Took a look ar her face
She fractures me

At last, I found
The girl for me
My life is now worthwhile
I'm in love, you see

Yes, I'm in love, you see
I'm in love, you see
Oh, I'm in love, you see
