Just Blaze, yeah
Check me out now
Yo, yo, yo, yo, check me out now
Yo, yo, yo, 
Let me hear ya say
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
Put your hands in the air everybody, c'mon
Where them dogs at


Hey yo, I'm immaculate, come through masculine
Wide-body frame, E-Dub's the name, whoa
In the field of rap, I'm supurb, I'm fly
I should be in the sky with birds
I ride 20 inch rims when I lean, yo
(Hey yo, them tens, nigga)
I know, I keep 'em clean though
Come through stormin' the block like El Nino
Scoop up an Arabic chick before she close
She goes, those my people
Yeah, them broads from Puerto Rico, them Keith's folks
Yeah, watch how the "E" locs 64
Black rags, black interior, shift on the floor
Burn out, I do it for the kids
They're  hoppin' the turn style, the "E" goin' wild
Yo, like them white chicks on a DVD
Yeah, I'm worldwide, MTV and BET, nigga

 -  Whateva' she said, then I'm that
If this here rocks to y'all, then react

Whateva' she said, then I'm that
If this here rocks to y'all, then react


Yo, do I gotta go ape or go nutty
I leave your eye like a 9-9 Benz-buggy, puffy
Brick niggas get real ugly
Trust me, keep your four if you feel lucky
Mug me, I ain't got nothin' but four figures
And weed and hash chopped in the coffee blender
My shots like squeegy men on your window
Usual suspect, I'm the crippled member
Get away when I sat down in the office
Heat in my lap keep me walkin' awkward
While y'all talk it, the doc reinforce it
The mic, it's hard to keep my paws off it
Yo' bitch is my bitch when it's over
No Cristal, I pulled up with King Cobra
Out in the Nova, don't bother
My Nino Brown bust, it'll shut down the corridor




Hey yo Red, he's over (Word?) with his shit right now
Watch this, told ya
Chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chillin', I'm +Milk+
I'm that kid +Gizmo+, we "Top Billin'"
Yo, when the roof is on fire, believe it, it's me
Sparks when I rock the mic like Segal & Free
When the pen hit the pad, the evil in me come out
Total recall for people to breathe

I got dogs in the backyard shittin' their lawns
We got chickens ain't leaving 'till six in the morning
Round and round we go, circle the area
Leave the party, go straight to the Marriott
Dozy-doe with cowboys where they saddle at
Rodeo with 20 fours on the Cadillac
What your name is, yo, R.E.D.
Crack cost money, but the "E" is free, yeah
