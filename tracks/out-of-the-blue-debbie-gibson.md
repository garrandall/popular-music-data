Without you, without you
I always thought that
Ev'rything was fine
Without you
Never knowing you'd be mine

Suddenly my world has changed
And I just wonder why
All it took was just one smile

Now it's you
Out of the blue
Love appeared
Before my eyes with you
Dream come true
I never thought I'd realize
What love was, what love was,
What love was

I need you, I need you
And every day I love you
More and more
Without you
I know what it's all for

Suddenly I see you there
And ev'rything's okay
Don't know why I feel this way

Now it's you
Out of the blue
Love appeared
Before my eyes with you
Dream come true
I never thought I'd realize
What love was, what love was,
What love was
Here with you
