Gee whiz
Look at his eyes
Gee whiz
How they hypnotize
He's got everything a girl could want
Man oh man
What a prize
Uh huh
Gee whiz
He's all the joy
Gee whiz
I could find in a boy
He's awful nice
It's paradise
I hope I'm not his decoy

Heaven up above
Knows how much I love
That fellah so
Angels sing
Of the love I bring
I hope our love will grow and grow
Cause, gee whiz
I love that guy
Gee whiz
My, my oh my
There are things we could do
I could say I love you
But all I could say is
Gee whiz
