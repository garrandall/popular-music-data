Gee whiz, look at his eyes
Gee whiz, how they hypnotize
He's got everything a girl could want and
Man, oh man, what a prize

Gee whiz, he's all the joy
Gee whiz, I could find in a boy
He's awful nice, he's paradise, and
I hope I'm not he's decoy
Because

Heaven up above knows how much
I love that gentle soul
Angels sing of a love like this
I hope our love will grow and grow
Oh

Gee whiz, I love that guy
Gee whiz, my, my, oh my
There are things we could do
And I could say I love you
But all I could say is gee whiz

Woah, gee whiz
Ah, gee whiz
