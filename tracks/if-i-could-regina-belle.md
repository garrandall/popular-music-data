If I could
I'd protect you
From the sadness
In your eyes
Give you courage
In a world
Of compromise
Yes, I would

If I could
I would teach you
All the things
I've never learned
And I'd help you
Cross the bridges
That I've burned
Yes, I would


If I could
I would try to shield
Your innocence
From time
But the part of life
I gave you isn't mine
I'll watch you grow
So I can let you go
If I could
I would help you
Make it through
The hungry years
But I know
That I can never
Cry your tears, babe
But I would if I could

If I could
In a time
And place
Where you
Don't wanna be
You don't have
To walk along
This road with me
My yesterday
Won't have to be
Your way

If I knew
I'd try
To change the world
I brought you to
Now there
Isn't much more
What I can do
But I would
If I could



If I could
