Tell me what you want and nothing more...

I don't know
I don't know
I don't know anybody else

I don't know
I don't know
I don't know anybody else

I don't know
I don't know
I don't know anybody else

I don't know
I don't know
I don't know anybody else

I'll tell you what I know so well
Your love is standing tall and swell
Why! Come on out and hear him say
Gonna get you now! Gonna get to you!
We're livin' by this inspiration

Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
You 'n' nobody else
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
Just walk this way
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
You 'n' nobody else
I wanna take you! So close to you!

Just gotta touch me
Just gotta touch me, touch me
Just gotta touch me
Just gotta touch me, touch me

Can't you say it to my eyes, to my face?
There's no need to wait
Gonna get you now! Gonna get to you!
We're livin' by this inspiration

Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
You 'n' nobody else
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
Just walk this way
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
You 'n' nobody else
I wanna take you! So close to you!

Just gotta touch me
Just gotta touch me, touch me
Just gotta touch me
Just gotta touch me, touch me

Just gotta touch me
Just gotta touch me, touch me
Just gotta touch me
Just gotta touch me, touch me

I don't know
I don't know
I don't know anybody else

I don't know
I don't know
I don't know anybody else

I don't know
I don't know
I don't know anybody else

I don't know
I don't know
I don't know anybody else

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on
