You look at me
And baby all you see
Are my blue eyes
I'm not a man

Baby, all I am
Is what I symbolize
Brown eyed woman
(Stay away, baby)

Brown eyed woman
(Stay away, baby)
Brown eyed woman
(Stay away, baby)

I could love you so
(No, no)
I could love you so
(No, no)

Brown eyed woman
I could love you so
(Mm, mm, mm)
All of the years

All the hate and the fears
Have twisted your heart
Now, you turn away
You won't trust what I say

And it's tearing me apart
Brown eyed woman
(Stay away, baby)
Brown eyed woman

(Stay away, baby)
Brown eyed woman
(Stay away, baby)
I could love you so
(Yes, yes)

I could love you so
(No, no)
I'm holding out my hand to you
Darling, tell me, tell me please

What more can I do
Brown eyed woman
(Stay away, baby)

Brown eyed woman
(Stay away, baby)
I want you, I need you
(Stay away, baby)

I'm holding out my hand
(Stay away, baby)
I don't wanna' stay away
No, no
(Stay away, baby)
