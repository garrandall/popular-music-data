All alone, on my own
Since I walked out on you, I walked out on me, now it's gone
And you, what to do
There's so much time,and so many nights to get through
Oh why do we play, and why do we lose
It's a dangerous life we live, we two

We are fools, we make all these rules
We make it so hard to find love, to feel free, to be fresh outta school
And now, what of romance
Do we know that life is sweeter when we're taking a chance
So why do we run, and why do we cry
It's a crazy life we life, you and I

Carousels and wishing wells were the things we loved
To fly away in a big balloon was what she talked of, oh...

Alone, out on my own
I just wander the streets and stare at the places we've known
And now, what of myself
Can I go on pretending a love for somebody else
Oh why do we play, and why do we lose
It's a dangerous life we live, we two

Carousels and wishing wells were the things we loved
Why did we play, why did we stay alone, we two
To fly away in a big balloon was what she talked of
Why did we love and leave the memory of we two
Now she is gone, I'm left to carry on
