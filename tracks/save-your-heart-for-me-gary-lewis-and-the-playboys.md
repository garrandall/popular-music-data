Walk along the lake with someone new
Have yourself with fling or two
But remember I'm in love with you
And save your heart for me

When the summer moon is on the rise
And you're dancin' under the starlit skies
Please don't let the star get in your eyes
Just save your heart for me

When you're all alone, far away from home
Someone's gonna flirt with you
I won't think it's wrong if you play along
Just don't fall for someone new

When the autumn winds began to blow
And the summertime is long ago
You'll be in my arms again I know
So save your heart for me
Darlin', save your heart for me

Please remember I'm in love with you
So save your heart for me
Darlin', save your heart for me
