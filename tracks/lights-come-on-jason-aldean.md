You're a crack of dawn Monday morning
Coffee strong pouring everything you got
Into a paycheck Friday night
You're a power stroke diesel backhoe riding
King of beers 18-wheeler driving
Livin' life in-between the lines of clocking in and quittin' time
Then the 6-string circus comes to town
We hang them speakers over the crowd

When the lights come on and everybody's screamin'
Lighters in the sky yeah everybody's singin'
Every word to every song
To the girl they're takin' home tonight
When the lights come on and everybody's feelin'
A hallelujah high from the floor to the ceiling
Yeah the drink that we're drinking the smoke that we're smoking
The party we're throwin's goin' all night long
When the lights come on
When the lights come on

You're a little shy thing with a wild side on a night like this it just can't hide 'Cause it's dyin' to live it up so come on and raise your cup
If we talkin' 'bout memories yeah we gonna make 'em
Talkin' 'bout rules you know we gonna break 'em

When the lights come on and everybody's screamin'
Lighters in the sky yeah everybody's singin'
Every word to every song
To the girl they're takin' home tonight
When the lights come on and everybody's feelin'
A hallelujah high from the floor to the ceiling
Yeah the drink that we're drinking the smoke that we're smoking
The party we're throwin's goin' all night long
When the lights come on
When the lights come on

Yeah we all the same 'cause we thinkin' the same thing
We on the same page 'cause we sippin' the same drink
Here's a little something to thank y'all for showing up
Aldean and the boys about to blow it up

When the lights come on and everybody's screamin'
Lighters in the sky yeah everybody's singin'
Every word to every song
To the girl they're takin' home tonight
When the lights come on and everybody's feelin'
A hallelujah high from the floor to the ceiling
Yeah the drink that we're drinking the smoke that we're smoking
The party we're throwin's goin' all night long
When the lights come on
When the lights come on

Boy's blowin' it up
It's goin all night long
When the lights come on
