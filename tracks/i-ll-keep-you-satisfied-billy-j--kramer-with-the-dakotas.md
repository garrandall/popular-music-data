I'll Keep You Satisfied
Billy J. Kramer with The Dakotas
(Lennon/McCartney)

You don't need anybody to hold you
Here I stand with my arms open wide
Give me love and remember, what I told you
I'll keep you satisfied
You don't need anybody to kiss you
Every day I'll be here by your side
Don't go 'way, I'm afraid that I might miss you
I'll keep you satisfied
You can always get a simple thing like love anytime
But it's diff'rent with a boy like me and a love like mine
So believe ev'rything that I told you
And agree that with me by your side
You don't need anybody to hold you
I'll keep you satisfied
You can always get a simple thing like love anytime
But it's diff'rent with a boy like me and a love like mine
So believe ev'rything that I told you
And agree that with me by your side
You don't need anybody to hold you
I'll keep you satisfied
Give me love and remember, what I told you
I'll keep you satisfied
