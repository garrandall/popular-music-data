Hello? Yeah, I just walked in
Yeah, I'm good… You still working?
Tonight… Right now? Did I go out?
Yeah, I went out, I went…
I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed, shit…
Wine or water
You said something about a cold drink?
I don't know, I'm delirious…


Cups of the rosé
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call her anyway, and say…


Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around


(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me


Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doin' that's so important?
I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call you anyway, and say…


Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around


(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me


I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talking 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of makin' monsters
Outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad
But, shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling, ‘cause they were just leavin'
Talk to me, please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's livin' off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week; I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame
Sprite in that mixture
I've been talkin' crazy, girl, I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
"Well, I'm sorry."


(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me


You're not gonna come?
Guess I'm 'bout to just kick it here then


Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said, "You niggas crazy"
I hope no one heard that
I hope no one heard that
‘Cause if they did, we gonna be in some trouble
We gonna be in some trouble, trouble
