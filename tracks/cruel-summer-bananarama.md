Hot summer streets 
And the pavements are burning 
I sit around 

Trying to smile 
But the air is so heavy and dry

Strange voices are saying 
What did they say 
Things I can't understand 
It's too close for comfort 
This heat has got right out of hand 

It's a cruel, cruel summer 
Leaving me here on my own 
It's a cruel, cruel summer 
Now you're gone 

The city is crowded 
My friends are away 
And I'm on my own

It's too hot to handle
So I got to get up and go 

It's a cruel, cruel summer 
Leaving me here on my own 
It's a cruel, 
It's a cruel cruel summer 
Now you're gone
You're not the only one

It's a cruel, cruel summer 
Leaving me
Leaving me here on my own 
It's a cruel, 
It's a cruel cruel summer 
Now you're gone

It's a cruel, cruel summer 
Leaving me here on my own 
It's a cruel, cruel summer 
Now you're gone 
You're not the only one

It's a cruel, cruel summer 
Leaving me
Leaving me here on my own 
It's a cruel, 
It's a cruel cruel summer 
Now you're gone
You're not the only one
