It's tired and I’m getting late
I try to speak but I can't relate
The DJ says I need my rest
Like a storm-lost bird I can't find my nest


I gotta get home to you
I gotta get home to you
I gotta get home to you


A strangers smokes and smiles and wants to speak
Says do you remember the corner on Beacon Street?
And the glimpse of light that I have seen
Fading faintly in my dream


I gotta get home to you
Wrap it up
And bring it on home to you
I gotta get it home to you


I lie on the bed, can’t get to sleep
I've been on the road about three weeks
She's says your not smiling, you must be sad
Yes, this lonesomeness is the worst I've had


I've gotta get home to you
Oh, yeah
Home to you
I gotta get home to you


The truth, the lies, the alibis
Every day we do and die
But the path was lost in the fallen snow
As we dance our days out there bellow


I gotta get home to you
Gotta bring it home to you
I gotta get home to you


It's tired and I'm getting late
I tried to speak but I can't relate
The DJ says I need my rest
Like a storm-lost bird I can’t find my nest


I gotta get home to you
Gotta get home to you
Wrap it up, wrap it up and
Bring it on home to you
