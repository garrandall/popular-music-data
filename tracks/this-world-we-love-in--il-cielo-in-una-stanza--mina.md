Here in our little room
It's a dreamy world we love in.
Stars falling, flowers bloom
When we share this world we love in.
Walls seem to disappear
The room is filled with willows.
Heaven is, oh, so near
The blissy clouds of pillows.
High in the deep blue sky
With all our cares behind us
We'll watch the world go by
No one will ever find us
It's such a world apart
This dreamy world we love in.
Only the young at heart
Can find this world we love in.
Just you and I, you and I
Alone
