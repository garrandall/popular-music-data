West end girls!

Sometimes you're better off dead
There's a gun in your hand and it's pointing at your head
You think you're mad too unstable
Kicking in chairs and knocking down tables
In a restaurant in a west end town
Call the police there's madman around
Running down, underground to a dive bar
In a west end town

In a west end town a dead end world
The east end boys and west end girls
In a west end town a dead end world
The east end boys and west end girls
West end girls

Too many shadows whispering voices
Faces on posters too many choices
If, when, why, what?
How much have you got?

Have you got it, do you get it if so how often?
Which do you choose a hard or soft option?

In a west end town a dead end world
The east end boys and west end girls
In a west end town a dead end world
The east end boys and west end girls
West end girls
West end girls

In a west end town a dead end world
The east end boys and west end girls
Ooh, west end town a dead end world
East end boys west end girls
West end girls
West end girls

You can find a place that no one knows
Where money talks and streets are gold
Someone stands in every door
And if they speak they break the law

(We can work something out)
(We can work something out)
Ask a question-blank faces
Read the news and turn the pages
Watch them play a different game
And no one knows your name (We- west)
No one knows your name
(Uh, uh, uh)
(West end girls)
(West end girls)

You've got a heart of glass or a heart of stone
Just you wait 'til I get you home
We've got no future, we've got no past
Here today, built to last
In every city in every nation
From Lake Geneva to the Finland station
In a west end town a dead end world
The east end boys and west end girls
A west end town a dead end world
East end boys west end girls
West end girls

(How far have you been?)
(How far have you been?)
(How far have you been?)
(How far have you been?)

And no one knows your name
No one knows your name
No one knows your name
No one knows your name
No one knows your name
No one knows your name
No one knows your name
No one knows your name
No one knows your name
No one knows your name
No one knows your name
No one knows your name
No one knows your name
