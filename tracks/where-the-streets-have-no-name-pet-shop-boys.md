(burning down love)
(burning down love)

I want to run, i want to hide
I want to break down the walls that hold me inside
I want to reach out, and touch the flame
Where the streets have no name
Ah-ha-ah

I want to feel the sun on my face
I see the dust cloud disappear without a trace
I want to take shelter from poison rain
Where the streets have no name
Ah-ha-ah

Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building, then burning down love
Burning down love
And when i go there
I go there with you
Where the streets have no name
Can't take my eyes off of you

I love you, baby, and if it's quite alright
I need you, baby, to warm a lonely night
So let me love you, baby
Let me love you

The city's aflood, our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind, trampled in dust
I'll show you a place, high on a desert plain
Where the streets have no name
Ah-ha-ah

Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building, then burning down love
Burning down love
And when i go there
It's all i can do
Where the streets have no name
I can't take my eyes off of you

(ooh aah)
Love you, baby, let me love you
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
