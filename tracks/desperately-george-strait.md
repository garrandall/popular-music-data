Every night it's the same
I hear you callin' my name
You're lyin' next to me
I give into your charms
You disappear in my arms
I realize it's just a dream, but


Desperately, I long to feel your touch
But you left me all alone in love

And now I
Shake the sleep from my head
And try to crawl out of bed
Today is just another day
I make the coffee for one
I turn the radio on
Pretend that everything's ok, but



And now I
Know there's no reason to smile
It's gonna take me awhile
'Cause I still love you desperately



And now I
Watch the sun goin' down
There ain't nobody around
I feel a night in the breeze
I keep on tellin' myself
I don't need nobody else
And I can do as I please, but

And now I



And now
Every night it's the same
I hear you callin' my name
I still love you desperately
I still love you
I still want you
I still love you desperately
