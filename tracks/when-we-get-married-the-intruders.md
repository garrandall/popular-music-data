Darlin', oh...

When we get married
We'll have a big celebration
And send invitations
To all our friends and relations

We'll have a ball
Dancin' and all
When we get married

When the bells ring
And tell the world I'm taking your hands
Folks from all over
Will come to see the wedding we planned

We'll have a ball
Dancin' and all
When we get married

(We'll have a time)
We'll have a time
And darling
We'll be, oh-so gay, hmmm
(We'll have a ball)
We'll have a ball
(Dancing and all)
And darling
We'll be as one

Just wait and see
Our wedding day
Is not very far
Old folks will whisper
And say how lovely
We both are

We'll have a ball
Dancin' and all
...When we get married
