Babe, somewhere I know I'm gonna find it, babe
It'll have my love behind it
And it will be a symphony of all you mean to me
A Very special love song

And Babe, if there's a way you know I'm gonna say it, babe
If there's a melody, I'll play it
And I'll play it through especially for you
And all the words are true
A very special love song

So don't be surprised if you're sittin' alone and you hear it
'Cause I'm gonna sing it to the whole big lonely world
So turn your radio way down low and get near it
And I'll tell the world I love you girl

Babe, if there's an ounce of love, I'm gonna give it to you, babe
If there's a breath of life, I'm gonna live it
Every day for you and all the whole night through
Singing just for you a very special love song
For you
