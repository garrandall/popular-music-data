Something's missing and I don't know why
I always feel the need to hide my feelings from you
Is it me or you that I'm afraid of?
I tell myself I'll show you what I'm made of
Can't bring myself to let you go


Don't want to cause you any pain
But I love you just the same
And you'll always be my baby
In my heart, I know we've come apart
And I don't know where to start
What can I do
I don't wanna feel blue


Bad girl drunk by six
Kissing someone else's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy when I act this way
Bad girl drunk by six
Kissing some kind stranger's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy
I'm not happy


Something's happened and I can't go back
I fall apart every time you hand your heart out to me
What happens now, I know I don't deserve you
I wonder how I'm ever gonna hurt you
Can't bring myself to let you go


I don't want to cause you any pain
But I love you just the same
And you'll always be my baby
In my heart I know we've come apart
And I don't know where to start
What can I do
I don't wanna feel blue


Bad girl drunk by six
Kissing someone else's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy when I act this way
Bad girl drunk by six
Kissing some kind stranger's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy
I'm not happy this way


I don't want to cause you any pain
But I love you just the same
And you'll always be my baby
In my heart I know we've come apart
And I don't know where to start
What can I do
I don't wanna feel blue


Bad girl drunk by six
Kissing someone else's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy when I act this way
Bad girl drunk by six
Kissing some kind stranger's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy
I'm not happy this way
I'm not happy this way
Bad girl drunk by six
Kissing someone else's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy when I act this way
Bad girl drunk by six
Kissing some kind stranger's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy
I'm not happy
This way


I'm not happy this way
Kissing some kind stranger's lips
