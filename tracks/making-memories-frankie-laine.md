We're making memories each time we kiss
Making wonderful memories when we are holding each other like this
Green grass for a pillow, a black velvet sky above
Tender magic moments in a wonderland of love

The years may come and go but we'll recall
Sharing love in our hideaway and how this night was the start of it all
Darling, I'll remember my whole life through
Making memories with you

(We're making memories each time we kiss)
(Making wonderful memories when we are holding each other like this)
Green grass for a pillow, a black velvet sky above
Tender magic moments in a wonderland of love

And the years may come and go but we'll recall
Sharing love in our hideaway and how this night was the start of it all
Darling, I'll remember my whole life through
Making memories with you

Making memories with you
