I believe
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh I believe, I believe
I believe, really do believe


I believe in the power and I'll never ever doubt
Every minute, every hour, I believe
I believe in myself 'cause I know I'll get my help
From the power in the sky, I believe


No need asking where I've been, just ask me where I'm going
'Cause I won't be ashamed to tell ya, I live my life knowin'
All the roads ahead of me are filled with peace and love
Every step so heavenly you'll fall and bounce right up


All miracles and dreams are realized for me through faith
Nothing seems impossible if you believe


I believe in the power and I'll never ever doubt
Every minute, every hour, I believe
I believe in myself 'cause I know I'll get my help
From the power in the sky, I believe


Looking in the mirror I can see my eyes are glowing
Living testimony that the spirit's in me growing
Oh, I'm feeling so good, got to raise my hands and rejoice
Say a few words to praise Him (praise Him) every time I lift my voice


All miracles and dreams realized for me through faith
Nothing seems impossible if you believe


I believe in the power and I'll never ever doubt
Every minute, every hour, I believe
I believe in myself 'cause I know I'll get my help
From the power in the sky, I believe
I believe in the power and I'll never ever doubt
Every minute, every hour, I believe
I believe in myself 'cause I know I'll get my help
From the power in the sky, I believe


Oh, just believe, believe
Oh brother, you gotta believe
Won't somebody help me? 'Cause I need a little help
Probably can't help myself
Gotta believe that you got the power
Gotta believe it every hour
Believe in yourself when you can't find no one else
To believe, hey, you got to believe


I believe in the power and I'll never ever doubt
Every minute, every hour, I believe
I believe in myself 'cause I know I'll get my help
From the power in the sky, I believe

I believe...
So good, so good to believe
Let hear ya say (I believe)
Do ya, do ya, do ya?
It's so good, it's so good to believe (I believe)

I believe in the power and I'll never ever doubt
Every minute, every hour, I believe
I believe in myself 'cause I know I'll get my help
From the power in the sky, I believe
