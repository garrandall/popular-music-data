Where I grew up, gettin' dressed up means
Buttoned down shirt and a good pair of jeans
Wasn't Sunday supper without collard greens
Dad was boss, Christ is king
Friday night was livin' for them lights to come on
Then I turned to Miller Lites when I turned 21
There's some things about me that I can't change
I'll always be the man that home made

Home made me love a dirt road
Home made me crave some ice cold homemade
Sweet tea only mama knows how to make
Homemade
Home made me love a small town
Home made me wanna settle down in a home made
For the two of us
Everything I love is homemade

My pickup lines didn't seem to work
Guess my pickup truck must've got to her
Windows down, singin' every word
Of that George Strait mixtape that was homemade

Home made me love a dirt road
Home made me crave some ice cold homemade
Sweet tea only mama knows how to make
Homemade
Home made me love a small town
Home made me wanna settle down in a home made
For the two of us
Everything I love is homemade

Hey, what we got you can't get from a store
Hey, the good stuff comes from the good Lord
Homemade

Home made me love a dirt road
Home made me crave some ice cold homemade
Sweet tea only mama knows how to make
Homemade
Home made me love a small town
Home made me wanna settle down in a home made
For the two of us
Everything I love is homemade

(Homemade, homemade)
Homemade
(Homemade, homemade)
Yeah, it's homemade
(Homemade, homemade)
Homemade
