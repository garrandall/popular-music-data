I don't know what it is that makes me love you so
I only know I never want to let you go
Cause you started something
Oh can't you see
Ever since we met you've had a hold on me
Its happens to be true
I only want to be with you

It doesn't matter where you go or what you do
I want to spend each moment of the day with you
Look what has happened with just one kiss
I never knew that I could be in love like this
It's crazy but it's true
I only want to be with you

You stopped you smiled at me
And asked me if I cared to dance
I fell into your open arms
I didn't stand a chance

Now listen honey
I just want to be beside you everywhere
As long as we're together honey I don't care
Cause you started something
Oh can't you see
Ever since we met you've had a hold on me
Its crazy but its true
I only want to be with you

Its crazy but its true
I only want be with you!

You stopped you smiled at me
And asked me if I cared to dance
I fell into your open arms
I didn't stand a chance

Now listen honey
I just want to be beside you everywhere
As long as we're together honey I don't care
Cause look what has happend after just one kiss
I never thought that I could be in love like this
Its crazy but its true
I only want to be with you

No matter what you do
I only want to be with you

Its crazy but its true
I only want to be with you!
