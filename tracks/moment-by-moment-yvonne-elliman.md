Though our love
Is like a whinding road
Of uncertainty
I long to trust your smile
And all the ways you feel touching me

Moment by moment
Our life time goes on
Till one day
Oh, some days are gone

Look at us
Two drifters with a dream
Scared to see it through
But we're so happy now
It might be beautiful if we do

Moment by moment
Our life time goes on
Till one day
Oh, some days are gone

Oh hoo
Moment by moment
The choices we make
Depend on the chances we take
Oh, for moment

Moment by moment
Our life time goes on
Till one day
Oh, some days are gone
