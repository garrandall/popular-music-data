I'm gonna go back out on the coast
Where the California girls are really the most

They walk that walk
They talk that talk
They twist a-like this
They shimmy
A-don't you hear me?
Yes, they're out there having fun
In the warm California sun

The girls are frisky in old Frisco
A pretty little miss-a wherever you go

They walk that walk
They talk that talk
They twist a-like this
They shimmy
A-don't you hear me?
Yes, they're out there having fun
In the warm California sun

The girls are pretty in-a old L.A
And the good sunshine keep them all that way

They walk that walk
They talk that talk
They twist a-like this
They shimmy
A-don't you hear me?
Yes, they're out there having fun
In the warm California sun
