I'm going out West where I belong
Where the days are short and the nights are long


Well, they walk and I walk
They twist and I'll twist
They shim and I'll shim
They fly and I'll fly
Well, they're out there having fun
In the warm California sun

I'm going out West, out on the coast
Where the California girls are really the most



The girls are frisky in old Frisco
A pretty little miss wherever you go
