Chrome, She can see herself In the shiny grill and the 
Wire wheels of a red Chevelle with four on the floor and the top down 
Chrome, zippin' by on an Electra Glide 
With dual tail pipes doin' 105 in the broad daylight 
On a two-lane headin' outta town 

Forget Pink and purple paisleys 
little mellow-yellow daisies 
Ain't no pot of gold in her rainbow 
Her favorite color is ..Chrome 

Chrome, get her leg up high 
on the bumper of my big black Mack truck 
With a smoke stack pointed towards the sky 
And mud flaps, you know the kind 
Chrome,I said hey little girl you sure look nice 
Do you wanna ride, I won't bite, she climbs inside 
Says hell no, I want to drive 

Forget Pink and purple paisleys 
little mellow-yellow daisies 
Ain't no pot of gold in her rainbow 
Her favorite color is ..Chrome 

It's chrome alright Shiny,nice polished 
Chrome, Chrome 

Forget Pink and purple paisleys 
little mellow-yellow daisies 
Ain't no pot of gold in her rainbow 
Her favorite color is ..Chrome 

Her favorite color is...chrome 
That girl is all about chrome 
She sure loves chrome
