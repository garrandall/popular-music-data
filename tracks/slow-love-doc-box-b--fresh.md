Bust it

Slow love (Damn, that sound good)
Makin' slow love
Makin' slow love
Makin' slow love
Makin' slow love

Slow love
Makin' slow love
Makin' slow love
Slow love
Makin' slow love
Makin' slow love
Let's make slow love

Girl, I can hardly wait till we're alone in my room
You bring the blanket, I'll bring the boom
I know the night is young, but that's just as well
'Cause by the time we're through the night it'll be old as hell
Turn of the TV, we'll be doin' it from dawn to dusk
The couple on the screen ain't got nothin' on us
We'll make love in slow motion like we're suspended in time
Erotic movements 'cause our bodies do become intertwined
Tell me, girl, are you ready for lust
Tonight I plan on givin' you the maximum thrust
You're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel
Word 'em up, Cool J, man, I know just how you feel
I'm aroused by your every touch
The very sound of your voice gets my gander up
It seems the longer we do it, it only gets better
So I'mma blow Keith Sweat, and make it last forever

Slow love
Makin' slow love (We can take, we can take our time)
(Let's not rush this thing) Let's make slow love
Slow love
Makin' slow love (Uh, huh, yeah)
Makin' slow love (We'll be makin' slow love)
Let's make slow love

Girl, me and you will hug tight in my living room dark
You're in your negligee and I'm just casually sharp
The only utter of light comes from the moon into the window
We're alone, slow music playing and then so
I ask you to dance, you willingly respond
By saying (Yes) and takin' me in your arms
So I'll walk you to the dance floor down in my room
Switch on the set lights as you put on perfume
Grab your body, pull you close, then pull you closer
My love starts to grow so I walk you to the sofa
Aroused by your beauty like when we first met
You walked into my life, then my future was set
Standing with me by the couch and sexy looks on your face
Like saying, "Take me, I'm yours" and "Love me down to the base"
I laid you down, kissed your navel, then moved up above
From your breast to your neck, hit the lights and make

Slow love
Makin' slow love (We can take, we can take our time)
(Oh... hm, oh... oh... oh..) Let's make slow love
Slow love
Makin' slow love (We're makin', makin', makin', makin' love)
Let's make slow love (Slow love)
Let's make slow love (And it feels so good to me, baby)

Uh, girl, when you're next to me (When you're next to me)
I'm in heaven ecstasy (We're in ecstasy)
You're drivin' me crazy, oh, no, do me, baby (Oh, ho, ho, ho)
Then after my dream only starts to flow
Girl, then it's up and down we go (Oh)
Oh, I feel your body shake (Give it to me, baby)
Girl, I'll give you all you can take

Let's make slow love
Can you feel it
Let's make slow love
Let's make slow love

Slow love
Let's make slow love (We can take, we can take our time)
Let's make slow love
Let's make slow love
Let's make slow love (Let's not rush this thing)

Slow love
Let's make slow love (Uh-huh, yeah)
Let's make slow love
Let's make slow love (Say, baby)
Let's make slow love (I'm so wrapped up in your love)

Slow love
Let's make slow love
Let's make slow love
Let's make slow love (No, no)
Let's make slow love

Slow love
Let's make slow love
Let's make slow love (Whoa...)
Let's make slow love
Let's make slow love

Slow love
Let's make slow love
Let's make slow love
Let's make slow love
Let's make slow love

Slow love
Let's make slow love
Let's make slow love
Let's make slow love
Let's make slow love

Slow love
Let's make slow love
Let's make slow love
Let's make slow love
Let's make slow love

Slow love
