Tuesday night crowded bar
Some guy lights a cheap cigar
Bartender yells at him
So he walks out and you walk in
Right through that cloud of smoke
Catcalls and dirty jokes
Scan the room a couple times
Find a seat right next to mine


Lonely eyes
Well, it sure looks like
You just might
Be looking for something
For something, whoa
Look at me
And I think You'll see
Those Lonely Eyes
Don't have to be alone tonight

They analyze your glass of wine
Roll away a pickup line
Now and then they check your phone
Catch mine and let 'em go
From the little bit I've seen
They're the perfect shade of green
Next time they come my way,
Heaven help me make 'em stay



Don't make me pay my tab
Catch a cab
Go home and kick myself to sleep tonight
Gimme a sign
Just a smile
Baby, I'll be glad to lose myself deep inside

Lonely eyes
Lonely eyes
Sure looks like
You just might
Be looking for something
For something, whoa
Look at me
And I think you'll see
Those lonely eyes
They don't have to be alone tonight
Lonely Eyes, you don't have to be alone tonight
