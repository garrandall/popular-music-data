That girl thinks that she's so fine
That soon she'll have my mind
That girl thinks that she's so smart
That soon she'll have my heart

She thinks in no time flat
That she'll be free and clear to start
With her emotional rescue of love
That you'll leave turn apart

That girl thinks that she's so bad
She'll change my tears from joy to sad
She says she keeps the upper hand
'Cause she can please her man

She doesn't use her love to make him weak
She uses love to keep him strong
And inside me there's no room for doubt
That it won't be too long

Before I tell her that I love her
That I want her
That my mind, soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to, that I want to
That I need to do all that I have to
To be in her love

I've been hurting for a long time
And you've been playing for a long time
You know it's true

I've been holding for a long time
And you've been running for a long time
It's time to do what we have to do

That girl, that girl
Yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

That girl knows every single man
Would ask her for her hand
But she says her love is much too deep
For them to understand

She says her love has been crying out
But her lover hasn't heard
But what she doesn't realize is that I've listened to every word
That's why I know

I'll tell that I love her
That I want her
That my mind, soul and body needs her

Tell her that I'd love to, that I want to
That I need to do all that I have to
To be in her love

Tell her I love her
That I want her
That my mind and soul and body needs her

Tell her that I'd love to, that I want to
That I need to do all that I have to
To be in her love

That I love her
That I want her
That my mind and soul and body needs her

Tell her that I'd love to, that I want to
That I need to do all that I have to

Tell her that I love her
That I want her
That my mind and soul and body needs her

Tell her that I'd love to, that I want to
That I need to do all that I have to
To be in her
That girl, that girl, that girl
Oh, that girl, that girl, that girl, that girl
