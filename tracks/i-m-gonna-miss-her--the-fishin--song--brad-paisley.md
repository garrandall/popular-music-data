Well I love her
But I love to fish
I spend all day out on this lake
And hell is all I catch
Today she met me at the door
Said I would have to choose
If I hit that fishing hole today
She'd be packing all her things
And she'd be gone by noon


Well, I'm gonna miss her
When I get home
But right now I'm on this lakeshore
And I'm sitting in the sun
I'm sure it'll hit me
When I walk through that door tonight
Yeah, I'm going miss her
Oh, look there, I've got a bite!


Now there's a chance that if I hurry
I could beg her to stay
But that water's right
And the weather's perfect
No telling what I might catch today


So, I'm gonna miss her
When I get home
But right now I'm on this lakeshore
And I'm sitting in the sun
I'm sure it'll hit me
When I walk through that door tonight
Yeah, I'm gonna miss her
Oh, look there, another bite!


Yeah, I'm gonna miss her
Oh, look there, I've got a bite!
