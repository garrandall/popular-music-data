As I read the letters that you wrote to me
Well it's you, it's you that I'm thinking of
As I read the lines that to me were so sweet
I remember our faded love

I miss you darlin' more and more everyday
As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat, I still think of you
And remember our faded love

As I think of the past, all the pleasures that we had
As I watch the mating of the doves
It was in the springtime that you said goodbye
I remember our faded love

I miss you darlin' more and more everyday
As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat, I still think of you
And remember our faded love
