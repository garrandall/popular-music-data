Don't lose the magic
Don't lose the magic

First time I laid my eyes on you
You were like a star in the night
Heaven must have sent your love
You were shining so bright

I was blinded by the passion
Want to feel your love tonight
I wanna go wherever you go
And I know love will follow

Oh, there's this magic in you
The way that you touch
Everything you do
My hearts keeps on telling me
This night will be full of ectasy

Don't lose the magic
(Don't lose the magic)
Let's keep this all to ourselves
Don't lose the magic
Don't want to give to no one else

Oh, there's such magic in you
The way that you touch
Everything you do
My hearts keeps on telling me
This night will be full of ecstasy

Don't lose the magic
(Don't lose the magic)
Let's keep this all to ourselves
(Hey, yeah) don't lose the magic
Don't want to give to no one else

Don't lose the magic
All of my love is for you
Don't lose the magic
All of my love comes shining through

Don't lose the magic
Don't lose the magic
Don't want to give to no one else

Don't lose the magic
Don't lose the magic

Don't lose the magic
Don't lose the magic

Oh, there's such magic in you
The way that you touch
Everything you do
My hearts keeps on telling me
This night will be full of ecstasy

Don't lose the magic
Let's keep this all to ourselves
Don't lose the magic
Don't want to give to no one else

Don't lose the magic
All of my love is for you
Don't lose the magic
All of my love comes shining through
