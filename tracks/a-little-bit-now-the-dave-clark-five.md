Hey, hey, hey, hey

Just a little bit now
And a little bit later
Just a little kiss
Kiss, kiss right now
Save the rest for later

Well, let me tell you now
You can't take love so fast
Oh, baby, it would never last

Just a little bit, baby
Just a little bit now
Now, now, now
Now, now, now, now

Just a little bit now
And a little bit later
You got to take it
So easy with love
As the loving gets greater

Oh, oh, whoa
There's too much love to grow
You got to take it, baby
Very, very slow

Just a little bit, baby
Just a little bit now
Now, now, now
Now, now, now, now

You know I want your loving
But not for just a day
We got to plan ahead
Or else our love will
Surely slip away

Just a little bit now
And a little bit later
Just a lot of good kiss
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
? Flavor

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Now that you are mine
We won't rush
We got a lot of time

Just a little bit, baby
Just a little bit now

You know I want your loving
But not for just a day
We got to plan ahead
Or else our love will
Surely slip away

Just a little bit now, yeah
Just a little bit later
Just a lot of good kiss
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
? Flavor

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Now that you are mine
We won't rush
We got a lot of time

Just a little bit, baby
Just a little bit now
