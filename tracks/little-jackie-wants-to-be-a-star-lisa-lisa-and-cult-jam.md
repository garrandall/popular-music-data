Oh
Little Jackie
(Little Jackie)
Alright


Oh
Little Jackie
She wants to be a star
She got off a Greyhound
In search of fortune and fame

Hoping to find a better way
And leave her troubles behind
But little did she know
That life was sometimes touch and go

Some never get it
Open your eyes
Or you'll learn to regret it


Oh
Little Jackie she wants to be a star
She's caught in the middle
(Of reality and what she's dreaming of)
Oh
Little Jackie she wants to be a star
(Smack dab in the middle of)
Oh
Growing up


Times Square
Is there where she makes it
(Some people never get there)
Then she met a guy
(So fine)
But he wants to buy nothing but a $5 high

Jackie, say no
(He'll try to change you)
Or rearrange you
(Or rearrange you)
Remember what your mama done told you
Never ever take gifts from a stranger




I'm talking bout
I said I'm talking 'bout Jackie
Oh, wah, wah, me
Oh, yeah

All that glitters ain't gold
(Don't let the green eyes fool you)
You're only 16 years old
(Don't let the streets try to rule you)

You never meant to be a runaway
Oh, no, no
No, no, no, no, ho
There's got to be a better way today
Today

Talking about Jackie
(I believe you, I believe you)
(If you believe in yourself
I really think you're gonna make it)

Ho, ooh, oh
Ooh, yeah

Talking about Jackie
(I believe you, I believe you)
(If you believe in yourself
I really think you're gonna make it)



I believe you
I believe you



I believe you
I believe you

Oh
Little Jackie
She wants to be
She wants to be a superstar
(If you believe in yourself
I really think you're gonna make it)
(Smack dab in the middle of growing up, ooh)

Woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo
