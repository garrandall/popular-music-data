Oh, Little Jackie (Little Jackie)
All right

Oh, Little Jackie she wants to be a star

She got off a Greyhound in search of fortune and fame
Hopin' to find a better way and leave her troubles behind
But little did she know that life was sometimes touch and go
Some never get it, open your eyes or you'll learn to regret it

Oh, Little Jackie she wants to be a star
She's caught in the middle (Of reality and what she's dreamin' of)
Oh, Little Jackie she wants to be a star
(Smack dab in the middle of) Oh, growin' up

(Times Square) Is there where she makes it (Some people never get there)
Then she met a guy (So fine) but he wants to buy nothin' but a $5 high
Jackie say no (He'll try to change ya) or rearrange you (Or rearrange ya)
Remember what your mama done told ya, never ever take gifts from a stranger

Oh, Little Jackie she wants to be a star
She's caught in the middle (Of reality and what she's dreamin' of)
Oh, Little Jackie she wants to be a star
(Smack dab in the middle of) Oh, growin' up

I'm talkin' bout
I said I'm talkin' 'bout Jackie
Oh, wah, wah, me
Oh, yeah

All that glitters ain't gold (Don't let the green eyes fool ya)
You're only 16 years old (Don't let the streets try to rule ya)
You never meant to be a runaway, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, ho
There's got to be a better way today, today

Talkin' about Jackie
(I believe ya, I believe ya)
(If you believe in yourself I really think you're gonna make it)
Ho... ooh... oh... ooh... yeah
Talkin' about Jackie
(I believe ya, I believe ya)
(If you believe in yourself I really think you're gonna make it)


Oh, Little Jackie she wants to be a star
She's caught in the middle (Of reality and what she's dreamin' of)
Oh, Little Jackie she wants to be a star
(Smack dab in the middle of) Oh (Growin' up)

(I believe ya, I believe ya)
Oh, Little Jackie she wants to be a star
(If you believe in yourself I really think you're gonna make it)
She's caught in the middle (Of reality and what she's dreamin' of)

(I believe ya, I believe ya)
Oh, Little Jackie she wants to be, she wants to be a superstar
(If you believe in yourself I really think you're gonna make it)
(Smack dab in the middle of growin' up, ooh)

Woo... woo... woo... woo... woo... woo...
(Yeah)
