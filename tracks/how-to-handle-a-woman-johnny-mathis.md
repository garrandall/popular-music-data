How to handle a woman
There's a way said a wise old man
A way known by every woman
Since the whole rigmarole began

Do I flatter her? I begged him answer
Do I threaten or cajole or plea?
Do I brood or play the gay romancer?
Said he, smiling, "No, indeed"

"How to handle a woman
Mark me well, I will tell you sir
The way to handle a woman
Is to love her, simply love her
Merely love her, love her, love her"
