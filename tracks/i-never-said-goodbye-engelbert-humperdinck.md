Sometimes at night I don't know why
I get the feeling that I wanna say goodbye
I can see me packin' up a bag and walkin' out the door
I'm goin' back to live the life I used to live before

Out on my own, all by myself
Not takin' care of me or anybody else
But how could I ever word it in the note I'd have write?
Oh, I don't know how to say goodbye

I lie in bed and I'm wide awake
Next to the one whose heart I'd hate to have to break
Then I look into her pretty eyes that don't deserve to cry
And I don't know how to say goodbye

Each time I hold her it's love all over
And in my heart it's understood
I'll never learn how to live without her
And I'd be crazy if I could

She's good to me and I believe
She let me go with it meant happiness for me
Maybe that's the reason why I find my tongue is tied
And I don't know how to say goodbye

Each time I hold her it's love all over
And in my heart it's understood
I'll never learn how to live without her
And I'd be crazy if I could

I love her so I wanna tell her now
I think I'll wake her with a kiss and show her how
And I know she'll whisper in my ear a million reasons why
I don't know how to say goodbye

And when she's layin' in my arms I cannot tell a lie
I don't know how to say goodbye

I don't know how to say goodbye
I don't know how to say goodbye
