I'm walking out that open door
I ain't looking back no more
See you later, see you later

I'm walking out that open door
I ain't looking back no more
See you later, see you later

Tell Urban Meyer and the mayor, the new Ohio player
Got everybody going up in the c-bus with a new Arch City banger
O-H, that's what they say when they ask where I'm from, then they say I-O
Used to live up north from the Hudson but east side is home
Marlo knows I'm the art work that Art worked to preserve sins
I was born looking like Leigh Ann first
Now I'm older and think I'm a perfect mix
And mama don't be nervous, I know you wondering when I'm goin' worship
You know I still got the heart of a servant; I'm just making these rappers nervous
I know, I'm perfect, no apostrophe, imperfect,
Taelor taught me how to be a wordsmith
I hope he hit a home-run on the first pitch, I know
School of roses baby, this a new Christon Gray
And never stop learning
Cats thought I sound like 50 shades, I know
This God given talent was always a challenge of mine
Nobody can stop me, he gave me a ladder to climb
I try to explain it but really its harder to define
I'll never conform to the way they think I should shine

You know the funny thing is, I think they know me now
Running through my city, I think they know me now
Feel like they took forever, I think they know me
My family rolling with me, need you to hold me down

I'm walking out that open door
I ain't looking back no more
See you later, see you later

I'm walking out that open door
I ain't looking back no more
See you later, see you later

What you know about merging the black n' white church in Linden boy
You know me as a artist I don't know how to tell yah I'm the youngest elder on the Linden board
I remember shopping the Berwick with my brother and grandma when I was still a boy
Counting pills when my crew topped billboard and when my album came out I was still employed
Sorry this ain't no pity party love my wife for her mind and not just her pretty body uh
My God not to mention my daughter got that swag like her mama looking just like her father I know
And being the man of the house is a challenge of mine, word
Nobody, can stop me they gave a ladder to climb, yea
I tried to explain but really its harder to define
Don't be worried about me homie I just be fine

You know the funny thing is I think they know me now
Running through my city I think they know me now
Feel like it took forever I think they know me
My family rolling with me and I won't let you down

I'm walking out that open door
I ain't looking back no more
See you later, see you later

I'm walking out that open door
I ain't looking back no more
See you later, see you later

I'm walking out that open door
I ain't looking back no more
See you later, see you later

I'm walking out that open door
I ain't looking back no more
See you later, see you later
