Oh my baby's comin home tomorrow
Ain't that good news
Yeah, ain't that news
My baby is coming home tomorrow
Ain't that news
Yeah, ain't that news

I got a letter just the other day
Telling me that he was on his way
And he wants me to meet him at the station
Ain't that good news
Yeah, ain't that news

In the letter he told me he still loved me
Ain't that good news
Yeah, ain't that news
In the letter he told me he loved me
Ain't that news
Yeah, ain't that news

He said he's sorry that he left
Found out he don't want nobody else
He said he wants me all to himself now
Ain't that good news
Yeah, ain't that news

Ain't that news
Ain't that good news
Ain't that news
Ain't that news

I said my baby's coming home tomorrow
Ain't that good news
Yeah, ain't that news

I'm gonna have him a party at the station
Ain't that good news
Yeah, ain't that news
Have a party at the station
Ain't that news
Yeah, ain't that news

And I can't wait to get him home
Where we can finally be alone
Disconnect my telephone now
Ain't that good news
Yeah, ain't that news

Ain't that news
Ain't that good news

I said my baby's coming home tomorrow
Ain't that good news
Yeah, ain't that news

Ain't that news
Ain't that good news
