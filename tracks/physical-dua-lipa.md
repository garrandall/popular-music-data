Common love isn't for us
We created something phenomenal
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
You got me feeling diamond rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?

Who needs to go to sleep, when I got you next to me?

All night I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical

Adrenaline keeps on rushing in
Love the simulation we're dreaming in
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
I don't wanna live another life
Cuz this one's pretty nice
Living it up

Who needs to go to sleep, when I got you next to me?

All night I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical

Hold on just a little tighter
Come on
Hold on, tell me if you're ready
Come on
Baby keep on dancing
Let's get physical
Hold on just a little tighter
Come on
Hold on, tell me if you're ready
Come on
Baby keep on dancing
Let's get physical

All night I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical

(Physical, Physical)
Let's get physical
(Physical, Physical)
Physical
(Physical, Physical)
Let's get physical
(Physical, Physical)
Come on
Phy-phy-phy-physical
