Oh.. I, I.. I


I wanna be bad witchu baby
I, I.. I, I
I wanna be bad witchu baby


Do you, understand what I need, need from you
Just let me the girl to show you, you
everything that she can be
Is everything that I can be (I wanna be)
My turn, lemme letchu know that I, I can
promise that I won't do that
So boy, say the time and place
cause you make me wanna mis-behave


I wanna be bad (bad), make that look so good 
I've got things on my mind, I never thought I would
I, I wanna be bad (bad), make that feel so good
I'm losin all my cool, I'm about to break the rules
I, I wanna be bad




Whassup?  Tell me what to do
How to be, teach me, all your rules from A to Z
but I, don't want your other girl to see
that you mess around wit me (ooh)

I should-a thought
Tell ya what I got is whatcha want
Tell, tell me, do I, I turn ya on?
I don't want no one judgin me





Willa, Willa, Willa, whatchu want?  Whatchu want?
Willa, Willa, Willa, whatchu want? (can I get it from you?)
Is it Em the "Criminal" wit the "Stan" look, uhh
You need a "Real Shady" to (please stand up)
Or is it me, the criminal wit the V
The never pretend to be, nothin other than a (bad boy)
If you say you want me, tell me how you gon' be
(hey Royce) Yo (I wanna be bad) c'mon
