Oh, I, I, I

Just let me the girl to show you, you
Everything that you can be
Except the thing that I can be (I wanna be)
My turn, lemme letchu know that I, I can
Promise that I won't do that
So boy, say the time and place
'Cause you make me wanna misbehave


I wanna be bad (Bad), make that look so good
I've got things on my mind, I never thought I would
I, I wanna be bad (Bad), make that feel so good
I'm losin' all my cool
I'm about to break the rules
I, I wanna be bad


I wanna be bad witchu, baby
I, I, I, I (Yeah)
I wanna be bad witchu, baby


Whassup? Tell me what to do
How to be, teach me, all your rules from A to Z
But I, don't wan't your other jealousy
That you mess around wit me (Oh)
I shoulda thought
Tell ya what I got is whatcha want
Tell, tell me, do I, I turn ya on?
I don't want no one judgin' me


I wanna be bad (Bad), make that look so good
I've got things on my mind, I never thought I would
(Never thought I would)
I, I wanna be bad (Bad), make that feel so good
I'm losin' all my cool
I'm about to break the rules (I'm about to break the rules, boy)
I, I wanna be bad



Willa, Willa, Willa, whatchu want? Whatchu want?
Willa, Willa, Willa, whatchu want? (Can I get it from you?)
Is it Em the "Criminal" wit the "Stan" look? (Uhh)
You need a "Real Slim Shady" to (Please stand up)
Or is it me, the criminal wit the V?
They never pretend to be, nothin' other than a (Bad boy)
If you say you want me, tell me how you gon' be
(Hey Royce) Yo
(I wanna be bad) C'mon


I wanna be bad (Bad), make that look so good
(You make that look so good)
I've got things on my mind, I never thought I would
(I never thought, I never thought I would)
I, I wanna be bad (Bad), make that feel so good
(Make that feel so good, make that feel so good)
I'm losin' all my cool, I'm about to break the rules
(I'm about to break, I'm about to break)
I wanna be bad (Bad), make that look so good
I've got things on my mind, I never thought I would
I, I wanna be bad (Bad), make that feel so good
I'm losin' all my cool, I'm about to break the rules
I, I wanna be bad
