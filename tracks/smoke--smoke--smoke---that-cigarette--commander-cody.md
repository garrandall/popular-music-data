Cho: Smoke! Smoke! Smoke that cigarette!
Puff, Puff, Puff and if you smoke yourself to death
Tell Saint Peter at the Golden Gate
That you hate to make him wait
But you've just got to have another cigarette

Now I'm a feller with a heart of gold
And the ways of a gentleman, I've been told
The kind of a guy that wouldn't even harm a flea--
But if me and a certain character met
The guy that invented the cigarette
I'd murder that son of a gun in the first degree--
Not 'cause I don't smoke myself
And I don't reckon they'll harm your health
I've smoked all my life and ain't dead yet
But nicotine slaves are all the same
At a pettin' party or a poker game
Everything must stop while they smoke that cigarette

In a game of chance the other night
Old Dame Fortune was a-doin' me right
The Kings and Queens just kept on comin' around--
I played 'em hard and bet 'em high
But my bluff didn't work on a certain guy
He kept on raisin' and layin' the money down
He'd raise me and I'd raise him
I sweated blood gotta sink or swim
He finally called and didn't raise the bet--
I said "Aces full, pal,--how 'bout you?"
He said "I'll tell you in a minute or two
Right now I've just got to have a cigarette."

The other night I had a date
With the cutest little girl in the forty eight states
A high-bred, uptown, fancy little dame--
She said she loved me and it seemed to me
That things were 'bout like they oughta be
So hand in hand we strolled down lover's lane--
She was oh, so far from a cake of ice
Our smoochin' party was a-goin nice
So help me Hannah, I think I'd a been there yet--
But I give her a kiss and a little squeeze
And she said "Tex excuse me please
I've just got to have another cigarette."

Well life ain't nothing but a poker game
No two hands quite the same
But I never saw a winner that didn't bet

So if any people tryin' to quit
I ain't gonna criticize you one bit
Just make mine a Jamaican cigarette
