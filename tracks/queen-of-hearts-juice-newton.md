Midnight, and I'm a-waiting on the twelve-oh-five
Hoping it'll take me just a little farther down the line

Moonlight, you're just a heartache in disguise
Won't you keep my heart from breaking
If it's only for a very short time

Playing with the queen of hearts
Knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anything for you
Laying out another lie
Thinking 'bout a life of crime
'Cause that's what I'll have to do
To keep me away from you

Honey, you know it makes you mad
Why is everybody telling everybody what you have done

Baby, I know it makes you sad
But when they're handing out the heartaches
You know you got to have you some

Playing with the queen of hearts
Knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anything for you
Laying out another lie,
Thinking 'bout a life of crime
'Cause that's what I'll have to do
To keep me away from you

Lovers, I know you've had a few
But hide your heart beneath the covers
And tell 'em they're the only one

And others, they know just what I'm going through
And it's a-hard to be a lover
When you say you're only in it for fun

Playing with the queen of hearts
Knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anything for you

Playing with the queen of hearts
Knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anything for you
Laying out another lie,
Thinking 'bout a life of crime
'Cause that's what I'll have to do
To keep me away from you

Playing with the queen of hearts
Playing with the queen of hearts
Playing with the queen of hearts
Playing with the queen of hearts
