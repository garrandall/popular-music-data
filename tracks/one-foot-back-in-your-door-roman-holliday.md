All right

It's like a bug - it's everywhere
Just like a fever - it's in your head
So don't be faithless - don't be blind
Stop standing there - stop wasting time

I'm a non-stop miracle - I'm your man
Touch me, baby - anyway you can!

I got one foot back in the door
One foot back on the floor
One foot back in your door, baby
All I need is some lovin', lovin', lovin' ah

Twinkle your star - like you do
I've seen that movie - you've seen it too
I give you rhythm - perfect time
If you wanna fly - then so do I

I'm a non-stop miracle - I'm your man
Squeeze me, baby - anyway you can

I got one foot back in the door
One foot back on the floor
I got one foot back in your door, baby
All I need is some lovin', lovin', lovin' ah

I got my motives - I got my plans
I got the power - it's in my hands
My senses swimming - diving for pearls
Calling all women - calling all girls
I'm king of fashion - I bring the news
One in a million - I'm a must for you
So don't be faithless - don't be blind

I'm a non-stop miracle - I'm your man
(A non-stop miracle - I'm your man)
Touch me, baby - touch me, baby

I got one foot back in the door
One foot back on the floor
One foot back in your door
All right

I got one foot back in the door
One foot back on the floor
(I'm coming back) One foot back in your door, baby

One foot back in the door
One foot back on the floor
I got one foot back in your door, baby
One foot back in the door
One foot back on the floor
I got one foot back in your door, baby
One foot back in the door
