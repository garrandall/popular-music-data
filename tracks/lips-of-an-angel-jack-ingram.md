Honey, why you calling me so late
It's kinda hard to talk right now
Honey, why you crying
Is everything okay
I gotta whisper cause I can't be too loud
Well, my girls in the next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on

It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words it makes me weak
And I never want to say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

It's funny that you're calling me tonight
And yes, I dreamt of you too
Does he know your talking to me
Will it start a fight
No, I don't think she has a clue
Well, my girls in the next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on

It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words
It makes me weak
And I never want to say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words it makes me weak
And I never want to say goodbye
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful
Those lips

I never want to say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel
