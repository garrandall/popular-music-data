Oh, I see her hand reaching out to me
Only she can set me free
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Oh, dee, dee-dee-dee, dee-dee-dee dee dee
Dee-dee-dee, dee-dee-dee dee dee dee
Have you seen her? (Have you seen her?)
Tell me, have you seen her? (Tell me, have you seen her?)

Why, oh why
Why did she have to leave and go away, oh yeah, yeah
Well, I've been used to havin' someone I can lean on
And baby, I'm lost
Baby, I'm lost, oh

One month ago today
I was as happy as a lark (Have you seen her?)
And now with all the friends I know (Tell me, have you seen her?)
I'm still a lonely man
Dee-dee-dee (Dee-dee-dee)
I go for walks (Have you seen her?)
Sometimes to the movies, and even to the park (Tell me, have you seen her?)
And all the children gather round
It's funny (Dee-dee-dee)
It's still funny (Have you seen her?)
They seem to know my name (Tell me, have you seen her?)
I keep hopin' that she'll be back (Dee-dee-dee)
(Have you seen her?) Have you seen her?
(Tell me, have you seen her?) Tell me, have you seen her?
All the little children, they gather round, we tell a few jokes (Dee-dee-dee)
You know, it still don't ease my pain (Have you seen her?)
'Cause tomorrow (Tell me, have you seen her?)
Tomorrow's their future

Dee-dee-dee (Dee-dee-dee)
(Have you seen her?)
Tomorrow's their future, but (Tell me, have you seen her?)
For me it's just another day
And then when I'm really, really feeling happy (Dee-dee-dee)
(Have you seen her?) I go to the mailbox
(Tell me, have you seen her?) I look for a card or a letter or some shit
(Dee-dee-dee) Anything that she might send
(Have you seen her?)
(Tell me, have you seen her?) Tell me, have you seen her?

Dee-dee-dee, dee-dee-dee, dee-dee-dee dee dee
Dee-dee-dee, dee-dee, have you seen her? (Have you seen her?)
Tell me, have you seen her?
