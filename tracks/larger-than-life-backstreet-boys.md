Hm
Yeah-ha-ha-ha-ha, woah
Ha-ha-ha-ha


I may run and hide
When you're screaming my name, alright
But let me tell you now
There are prices to fame, alright


All of our time spent
In flashes of light-ight-ight-ight


All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life
Alright


Looking at the crowd
And I see your body sway, come on
Wishing I could thank you
In a different way, come on


'Cause all of your time spent
Keeps us alive, yeah


All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life
Larger than life


Yeah, haha, that's right
All of your time spent
Keeps us alive-ive-ive-ive-ive, yeah


All you people, can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life


Yeah, every time we're down
Yeah, you can make it right
Yeah, and that is what makes you larger than life
Yeah, yeah


All you people, can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life
(That makes you larger than life)
That makes you larger
That makes you larger than life
