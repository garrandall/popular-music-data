I found out the hard way
And I'm never gonna break your heart
I know, too late
And I don't want to break your heart
Guess I had to go away just to find
What I left behind

You're the only one, you're the only one
Take me back to where we started from
And let's make it now like we made it then
This old heart ain't gonna break your heart again

Nights I lay in bed
And your covers wouldn't warm my feet
And morning found me
Bitter or a bit too sweet
Oh baby, I had to go away
Just to run back and say

You're the only one, you're the only one
Take me back to where we started from
Can we make it now like we made it then?
This old heart ain't gonna break your heart again

You're the only one, darling
They'll never be anyone else but you
I love you so much
You are my love, you've become my life
And I never meant to break your heart
But sometimes you've just got to go away
To find what you left behind

You're the only one, you're the only one
Take me back to where we started from
Can we make it now like we made it then?
This old heart ain't gonna break your heart again

You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
The only one
Take me back to where we started from
You're the only one
The only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
The only one
