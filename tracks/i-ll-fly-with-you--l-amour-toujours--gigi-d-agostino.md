I still believe in your eyes
I just don't care what you've done in your life
Baby, I'll always be here by your side
Don't leave me waiting too long, please come by
I, I, I, I still believe in your eyes
There is no choice, I belong to your life
Because I, I live to love you some day
You'll be my baby and we'll fly away


And I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you

You are, oh!
You are, oh!
You are, oh!


Every day and every night
I always dream that you are by my side
Oh, baby, everyday and everynight
Well, I said everything's gonna be alright


And I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you

You are, oh!
You are, oh!
You are, oh!


I still believe in your eyes
I just don't care what you've done in your life
Baby, I'll always be here by your side
Don't leave me waiting too long, please come by
I, I, I, I still believe in your eyes
There is no choice, I belong to your life
Because I, I live to love you some day
You'll be my baby and we'll fly away


And I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you

You are, oh!
You are, oh!
You are, oh!


Every day and every night
I always dream that you are by my side
Oh, baby, everyday and everynight
Well, I said everything's gonna be alright


And I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you

You are, oh!
You are, oh!
You are, oh!
