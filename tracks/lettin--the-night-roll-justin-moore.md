That water tower's got the sun going down behind it
If thereâ€™s a good time in this town, girl, we're gonna find it
You looked so damn good climbin' up in my Chevy
Tried to play it cool but I knew already
By the way you looked in the dashboard lights
It was gonna be one of those nights


Got the Kenwoods bangin that rock n' roll
Whisper to me baby, where you wanna go
I can ride you round town or drive you down some old back road
I love the way you lean that seat back, steal my ball-cap
Pull it down over your blue eyes
Watchin' your hair fly out the window
Just lettin' the night roll
And I can't wait to see where it goes


We can run the reds down Mainstreet dodging the blue lights
Or disappear off into the corn out past the county line
Baby keep on keep on swaying to the back-beat
Long as you're right here right here beside me
You make the call baby, I don't care
We can take this anywhere



Whisper to me baby, where you wanna go
I can ride you round town or drive you down some old back road

Pull it down over your blue eyes
Watchin' your hair fly out the window
Just lettin' the night roll
And I can't wait to see where it goes



Whisper to me baby, where you wanna go
I can ride you round town or drive you down some old back road

Pull it down over your blue eyes
Watchin' your hair fly out the window
Just lettin' the night roll
And I can't wait to see where it goes



And I can't wait to see where it goes
I can't wait to see where it goes, oh yeah
Just lettin' the night roll
