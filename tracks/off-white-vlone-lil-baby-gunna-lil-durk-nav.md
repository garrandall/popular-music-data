Run that back Turbo


Shopping sprees for fun
She did Saint Laurent
Atlas in my room
Private flight to Milan ('lan)
Ice VVs (ice, ice)
Ice VS1s (ice VS1s)
Off White VLONE's
Foreigns parked on my lawn


Them 40's come with drums
I like my bitches blonde
Walk hard, give me the runs
Don't none of my hoes wear Uggs
If you go in her, you can't call off
Nah, hoe we can't raw dog
Off Percs and X, can't nod off
If I call you the plug, can't fall off


Coupe from outer space (shh)
Trust me, I'm okay (I'm okay)
Buy Hi-Tech paint by the case (By the case)
You can tell that's Chanel by the lace (Chanel)
You can tell it's a bale by the weight (By the weight)

Smash, I don't never use the breaks


She asked me for cash, are you serious?
New car Fast and the Furious
Spend a big bag on the mirrors
I got a big bag, that's period
