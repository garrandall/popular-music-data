Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now
Hit it
Haha, cut, cut funky
Ha, water boy, the boy with the bucket, heh
If you didn't want your job, ha, you should not have took it
Water boy, boy with the string
Get back, let me do my thing
Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now
Hit it, ha

I can't plan it
Ah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Everybody, I ain't through
I got to give you a taste of part two
St. Claire, ha, I hear you
Maceo, you can blow
Pee Wee, blow, ha
Pee Wee, be sure
Everybody, you heard what I said
Hey Fred, you heard what I said
Hey Fred, you heard what I said
A looka here, brother want a head
Uh, get it



Ha, get it
Watch out, watch out, Melvin, come on
Good God, good God
Give me a little bit more of that, Melvin, come on
Good God, I gotta, I gotta get it, huh
Hey Fred, let me blow her head
A looka here, hey
Come on, blast, not in the last
Ow, ow
