It makes no difference
If you're rich or poor
Or if you're smart or dumb
A woman's place in this old world
Is under some man's thumb

And if you're born a woman
You're born to be hurt
You're born to be stepped on
Lied to, cheated on
And treated like dirt

Ah, if you're born a woman
You're born to be hurt
A woman's lot is to give and give
And go on giving
A woman's got to love and lose
And go on living

Well, I was born a woman
I didn't have no say
And when my man finally comes home
He makes me glad it happened that way
Because to be his woman
No price is too great to pay

Yes, I was born a woman
I'm glad it happened that way
Oh, I was born a woman
I'm glad it happened that way
