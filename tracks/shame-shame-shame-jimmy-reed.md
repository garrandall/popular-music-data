Well I tried to tell you baby
But it make no sense
Know you got me baby
Up against this fence

An' ain't that a shame, shame, shame
Shame, shame the way you do
Well, it's a shame, shame, shame
Shame, shame, on you

Well now you walk out in the evenin'
Don't even say you goin'
Six o'clock in the mornin'
You come walkin' home

An' ain't it a shame, shame, shame
Shame, shame, the way you do
Well, it's a shame, shame, shame
Oh it's a shame on you

Well, I be sittin' there waitin'
For you to come home
When I wake up baby
I'm sittin' there all alone

An' ain't it a shame, shame, shame
Shame, shame, the way you do
Oh, it's a shame, shame, shame
Shame, shame on you
