Stripped to the waist
We fall into the river
Cover your eyes
So you don't know the secret


I've been trying to hide
We held our breath
To see our names are written


On the wreck of '86


That was the year
I knew the panic was over


But since we found out
Since we found out


Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could

Uh, uh, uh, uhuh
Uh, uh, uh, uhuh
Uh, uh, uh, uhuh
Uhuh, uh, uhuh


After the war we said we'd fight together


Oh whoa whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa whoa


I guess we thought that's just what humans do


Oh whoa whoa whoa


But now I've seen it through
And now I know the truth


Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could

Uh, uh, uh, uhuh
Uh, uh, uh, uhuh
Uh, uh, uh, uhuh
Uhuh, uh, uhuh


Baby, I'll give you everything you need
I'll give you everything you need, oh yeah
I'll give you everything you need


I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be


I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be
Alright

Uh, uh, uh, uhuh
Uh, uh, uh, uhuh
Uh, uh, uh, uhuh
Uhuh, uh, uhuh

Since we found out
Since we found out
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could

Uh, uh, uh, uhuh
Uhuh, uh, uhuh
