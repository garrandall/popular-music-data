I'm fabulous
Hi mommy!
Hi daddy
I'm fabulous! Ha-ha!


Young cat got back did a little bid
Kind of hearty but he tough, doorag and timbs
Kind of hard to get a job
Back out on the block
(charge that to the game)

Young girl she grew up in a rush
Had it bad, no doubt she don't know who to trust
Every man she ever loved only wanna crush
(charge that to the game)


But its all gravy, hey babyy
Shots get popped, the cops shut down the party
Jeans sag low blow smoke out of dutches
We got love for ya'll but ya'll don't love us


Now we swerve in the suburban and switching lanes
Spend up all our dough on them chrome and thangs
Name our kids some funny names
Don't hate on us we're fabulous

Prepaid cellies for local calls
Little dons and divas up at the malls
Rocking cornrow twists, that's how we ball
Don't hate on us we're fabulous


They met he said how she was a dime
So naive that she believed every single lie
17 first time slipped up bout to have a child
(charge that to the game)

Was just us and mom, single parent home
She did the best she could, did it all alone
Met a man but he won't raise a child that's not his own
Oh, no
Oh, no, no


But its all gravy, hey baby
Shots get popped, the cops shut down the party
Jeans sag low blow smoke out of dutches
We got love for ya'll but ya'll don't love us


Now we swerve in the suburban and switching lanes
Spend up all our dough on them chrome and thangs
Name our kids some funny names
Don't hate on us we're fabulous

Prepaid cellies for local calls
Little dons and divas up at the malls
Rocking cornrow twists, that's how we ball
Don't hate on us we're fabulous


We're all that we've got
And no matter whatever
Together we'll weather the storm
It ain't a lot, we all we got
It might get rough, but it's alright
Cause U-N-I-T-Y is all we need
To get our R-E-S-P-E-C-T


And never G-I-V-E U-P
And keep your H-E-A-D U-P (Oh!)
And never G-I-V-E U-P (Oh, yeah!)
And keep your H-E-A-D U-P
And never G-I-V-E U-P (Never never never give up)
And keep your H-E-A-D U-P
And never G-I-V-E U-P (Oh, never give up)
And keep your H-E-A-D U-P
And never G-I-V-E U-P
And keep your H-E-A-D U-P
And never G-I-V-E U-P
And keep your H-E-A-D U-P
