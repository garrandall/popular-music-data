Big or small
In and out
None at all

If it feels good, it's all right
If it feels good, it's all right
Tell me when you feel it

Front and back
Hot and cold
Sweet and sour
Young and old

If it feels good, it's all right
If it feels good, it's all right
Tell me when you feel it

Right or wrong
Black and white
Weak and strong
Day and night

If it feels good, it's all right
If it feels good, it's all right
Tell me when you feel it

Short and tall
Wet and dry
High or low
Truth or lie

Life or death
Life or death

Life or death
Life or death
In G and A
In G and A

Life or death
Life or death
In G and A

On the ground
Tell me when you feel it
Yeah, yeah
