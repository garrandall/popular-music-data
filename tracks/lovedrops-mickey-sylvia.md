My love came tumbling down
Just like raindrops
Thundering raindrops from the sky

I can really feel these love drops
Are really, really raindrops
Candy-coated lovedrops in my eyes

I wish someone had told me
Your love was never meant to be
Now they're trying to tell me
You're gonna set me free

That's why
My love came tumbling down
Just like raindrops
Thundering raindrops from the sky

I wish someone had told me
Your love was never meant to be
Now they're trying to tell me
You're gonna set me free

That's why
My love came tumbling down
Just like raindrops
Thundering raindrops from the sky

Talk about those raindrops
Thundering raindrops
Candy-coated lovedrops
