If it's
If it moves from
If it snaps
'Cause you're hungry to feed it

If you listen they'll tell you
That your seamstress have failed you
If you're ready to be there
For the sensual love man

Always searching for a thrill
They keep
Always searching for a thrill
Walking down the street, they sleep
Always searching for a thrill

If you're lookin' to shock you
'Cause they're tryin' to rock you
Playin' Queen, Jimmy Dean
It's an adolescent movie screen

Always searching for a thrill
On and on and on they keep
Always searching for a thrill
Up and down the street they sleep
Always searching for a thrill



Always searching for a thrill
On and on and on they keep
Always searching for a thrill
Up and down the street they keep
Always searching for a thrill
