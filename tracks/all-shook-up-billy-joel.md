Well I bless my soul, what's wrong with me?
I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm actin' queer as a bug
I'm in love, I'm all shook up
Mm mm mmm,yay yay, yeah!

Well my hands are shaky and my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Now, who do you thank when you have such luck?
I'm in love, I'm all shook up
Mm mm, mmm ,yay, yay, yeah!

Well please don't ask me what's on my mind
I'm a little mixed up, but I'm feelin' fine
When I'm near that girl that I love best
My heart beats so that it scares me to death

She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her kisses are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say she's my buttercup
I'm in love, I'm all shook up
Uh-huh, uh, yay, yay , yeah!

Well my tongue gets tied when I try to speak
My insides shaken like a leaf on a tree
There's only one cure for this soul of mine
That's to have the girl that I love so fine

She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her kisses are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup
I'm in love, I'm all shook up
Uh-huh, uhh, hey, yeah

Uh-huh, uhh, hey
Uh-huh, oh, hey
I'm all shook up
