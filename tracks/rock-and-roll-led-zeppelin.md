It's been a long time since I rock and rolled
It's been a long time since I did the Stroll
Oh, let me get it back, let me get it back
Let me get it back, baby, where I come from


It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

Yes it has


It's been a long time since The Book of Love
I can't count the tears of a life with no love
Carry me back, carry me back
Carry me back, baby, where I come from


It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time


Seems so long since we walked in the moonlight
Making vows that just can't work right
Open your arms, opens your arms
Open your arms, baby, let my love come running in


It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
