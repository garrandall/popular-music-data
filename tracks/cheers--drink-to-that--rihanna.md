Takin' shots in here, you want one?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)


Cheers to the freakin' weekend
I drink to that, yeah yeah
Oh, let the Jameson sink in
I drink to that, yeah yeah
Don’t let the bastards get you down
Turn it around with another round
There’s a party at the bar
Everybody put your glasses up, and I drink to that
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)
I drink to that


Life’s too short to be sitting around miserable
People gonna talk whether you doing bad or good, yeah
Got a drink on my mind, and my mind on my money, yeah
Looking so bomb, gonna find me a honey


Got my Ray-Bans on and I’m feeling hella cool tonight, yeah
Everybody’s vibing, so don’t nobody start a fight, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)


Cheers to the freakin' weekend
I drink to that, yeah yeah
Oh, let the Jameson sink in
I drink to that, yeah yeah
Don’t let the bastards get you down
Turn it around with another round
There’s a party at the bar
Everybody put your glasses up, and I drink to that
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)
I drink to that


'Bout to hop on the bar
Put it all on my card tonight, yeah
Might be mad in the morning, but you know we goin' hard tonight
It’s getting Coyote Ugly up in here, no Tyra
It’s only up from here, no downward spiral


Got my Ray-Bans on and I’m feeling hella cool tonight, yeah
Everybody’s vibing, so don’t nobody start a fight, yeah


Cheers to the freakin' weekend
I drink to that, yeah yeah
Oh, let the Jameson sink in
I drink to that, yeah yeah
Don’t let the bastards get you down
Turn it around with another round
There’s a party at the bar
Everybody put your glasses up, and I drink to that
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)
I drink to that


Cheers to the freaking weekend
I drink to that, yeah yeah
Oh, let the Jameson sink in
I drink to that, yeah yeah
Don’t let the bastards get you down
Turn it around with another round
There’s a party at the bar
Everybody put your glasses up, and I drink to that
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)
I drink to that


And I drink to that
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)
I drink to that
And I drink to that
