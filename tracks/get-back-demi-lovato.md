Don't walk away like you always do this time
Baby, you're the only thing that's been on my mind
Ever since you left, I've been a mess
(You won't answer your phone)
I'll say it once and I'll leave you alone
But I gotta let you know


I wanna get back to the old days
When the phone would ring and I knew it was you
I wanna talk back and get yelled at
Fight for nothing, like we used to
Oh, kiss me like you mean it, like you miss me
'Cause I know that you do
I wanna get back, get back with you (Yeah)


Don't look at me that way, I see it in your eyes
Don't worry about me, I've been fine
I'm not gonna lie, I've been a mess since you've left
And every time I see you, it gets more and more intense


I wanna get back to the old days
When the phone would ring and I knew it was you
I wanna talk back and get yelled at
Fight for nothing, like we used to
Oh, kiss me like you mean it, like you miss me
'Cause I know that you do
I wanna get back, get back with you


You were the only one I wanted
And you were the first one I fell for
You're the only one that I'm in need of
And I don't wanna be lonely anymore


I wanna get back to the old days
When the phone would ring and I knew it was you
I wanna talk back and get yelled at
Fight for nothing, like we used to
Oh, kiss me like you mean it, like you miss me
'Cause I know that you do
I wanna get back, get back with you


(Get back) get back
(Get back) get back
(Get back) get back
(Get back) get back


Oh, kiss me like you mean it, like you miss me
'Cause I know that you do
I wanna get back, get back
I wanna get back, get back
I wanna get back, get back
Get back
Yow!
