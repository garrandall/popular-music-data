Yeah, I really want you baby
Do you really want me, 'cause I want you, Do you want me
Do you want me? Want me?
Do you really want me, 'cause I want you, Do you want me 'cause I know that I love you
Do you really want me, 'cause I want you, Do you want me
Do you really want me, 'cause I want you, Do you want me 'cause I know that I love you

Everytime I try and walk away
I'm magnetized and want to stay
There's a better way to reach the sky
Don't get me down I'm here to say
The way you do the things you do
Touches my soul
The feelings that we have to share is out of control
You let me down, see you around, I take my heart
Can't express deeper the feelings I share
I want you more than you know
I need you please let me show you
I want you more than you know
I need you please let me show you

Do you want me, 'cause I want you, Do you want me 'cause I know that I love you
Do you want me, 'cause I want you, Do you want me 'cause I want you to want me too
Do you want me, 'cause I want you, Do you want me 'cause I know that I love you
Do you want me, 'cause I want you, Do you want me 'cause I want you to want me too

Baby, baby oh listen to me
I'm as helpess as a kitten up a tree
Being honest with my heart and not my mind
'Cause I can tell you're the real loving kind

The way you do the things you do
Touches my soul
The feelings that we have to share is out of control
You let me down, see you around, I take my heart
Can't express deeper the feelings I share
I want you more than you know
I need you please let me show you
I want you more than you know
I need you please let me show you

Do you want me, 'cause I want you, Do you want me 'cause I know that I love you
Do you want me, 'cause I want you, Do you want me 'cause I want you to want me too
Do you want me, 'cause I want you, Do you want me 'cause I know that I love you
Do you want me, 'cause I want you, Do you want me 'cause I want you to want me too

I want you, you know I really do and there's only you
The way you do the things you do
The feelings that we have to share
Out of control
You let me down, see you around,
I take my heart
Can't express deeper
The feelings I share
I want you more than you know
I need you please let me show you
I want you more than you know
I need you please let me show you
I want you more than you know
I need you please let me show you
I want you more than you know
I need you please let me show you

'Cause a woman needs a good man
To understand
'Cause a woman needs a good man
Who will understand
I'm here for you
I won't leave you
I need you
I want you
You know I'm begging you please
