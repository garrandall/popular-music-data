Since you've been gone
I can't think right
Can't even sleep
Or eat a bite

I'm sending you an S.O.S.
I pray your heart will answer yes

And free me
Come around and free me
Only you can free me from this misery

I know that I told you a lie
But did you have to say goodbye
Without your love I can't go on
So please don't leave me all alone

Oh free me!
Darling, darling, free me!
Only you can free me from this misery

You are the judge and jury
My life is in your hands
I'm begging you for mercy
Please don't forget the life we had

So please don't forget the past
Because our love was meant to last
Don't try to change our destiny
Say you'll forgive and set me free

Oh free me!
Darling, darling, free me!
Only you can free me from this misery

And free me!
Darling, darling, free me!
Only you can free me from this misery
