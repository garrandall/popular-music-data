Take one fresh and tender kiss
(Sweet sweet, the memories you gave to me, yeah)
Add one stolen night of bliss
(How sweet, the memories you gave to me, oh)
Oh, one girl, one boy, some grief, some joy
Memories are made of this
(Sweet sweet, the memories you gave to me)
(How sweet, the memories you gave to me)

Don't forget a small moonbeam
(Sweet sweet, the memories you gave to me)
Fold in lightly with a dream
(How sweet, the memories you gave to me)
Oh, your lips and mine, two sips of wine
Memories are made of this
(Sweet sweet, the memories you gave to me)
(How sweet, the memories you gave to me)

Then add the wedding bells
One house where lovers dwell
Three little kids for the flavor
Stir carefully through the days
See how the flavor stays
These are the dreams you will savor
(Sweet sweet, the memories you gave to me)

With His blessings from above
(Sweet sweet, the memories you gave to me, yeah)
Serve it generously with love
(How sweet, the memories you gave to me, oh)
Hm, one man, one wife, one love through life
Memories are made of this
(Sweet sweet, the memories you gave to me, yeah)

Memories are made of this
(How sweet, the memories you gave to me, oh)
(Sweet sweet, the memories you gave to me, yeah)
Oh, memories are made of this
(How sweet, the memories you gave to me, oh)
(Sweet sweet, the memories you gave to me, yeah)
Memories are made of this
(How sweet, the memories you gave to me, oh)
