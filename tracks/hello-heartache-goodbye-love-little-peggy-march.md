Hello heartache
Goodbye love
Goodbye love
Goodbye love

Love him
How much do I love him?
So much
He will never know
New love
He has found a new love
I know I must let him go
There they go is their happiness
Here I go in my loneliness

Hello heartache
Goodbye love
Goodbye love
Goodbye love

Love him
Will she really love him?
Deeply
Half as much as I
Always
Will she love him all ways
I will till the day I die.
