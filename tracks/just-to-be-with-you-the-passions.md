Just to be with you
Just to be with you
There is nothing I wouldn't do
Just to be with you.
I'd climb a mountain or sail the seas
I'd go a thousand miles upon my knees
I'd find a rainbow and take it from the sky
I'll be a slave till the day I die.
I'll build a castle like those of old
And I would fill it with lots of gold
I'd find the writings of what's supposed to be
I'll count the stars in the galaxy.
