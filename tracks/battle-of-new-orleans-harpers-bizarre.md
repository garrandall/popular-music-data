In 1814 we took a little trip
Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip'
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
And caught the bloody British near the town of New Orleans

We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
Fired once more and they began to runnin'
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

We looked down the river and we seed the British come
There must have been a hundred of 'em beatin' on the drum
Stepped so high and they made the bugles ring
We stood beside our cotton bale and didn't say a thing

We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
Fired once more and they began to runnin'
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise
If we didn't fire our musket 'til we looked 'em in the eyes
We held our fire 'til we seed their faces well
And opened up our squirrel guns and really gave 'em
Well, we

Fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

Well, they ran through the briers and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

We fired our cannon 'til the barrel melted down
So we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round
We filled his head with cannonballs and powdered his behind
And when we touched the powder off, it blew the gator's mind

We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

Well, they ran through the briers and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
