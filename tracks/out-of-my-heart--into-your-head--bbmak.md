I feel fine 
Now the rain has gone and the sun has come to shine 
Nothing can get me down today 
Head over heels 
Got my mind made up as Iâm driving through the fields 
Nothing can get me down again 

Catch me if you can 
Iâve gotta make a getaway 

As the sun goes down, wakinâ up my dreams 
And in my mind youâre with me once again 
Out of my heart, into your head 
And inside my heart thereâs a place for you 
And in my mind Iâm with you once again 
Out of my heart, into your head 

Chasing the sun 
Tryinâ to get away 
From the rain thatâs gonna come 
Hope I make it all the way 

Iâm lost in a crowd 
Tryinâ to find my way 
But the rain keeps fallinâ down 
Doesnât matter anyway 

Catch me if you can
Iâve gotta make a getaway 

As the sun goes down, wakinâ up my dreams 
And in my mind youâre with me once again 
Out of my heart, into your head 
And inside my heart thereâs a place for you 
And in my mind Iâm with you once again 
Out of my heart, into your head 

Take a look at the sky
Feel the sunshine 
In your heart 
In your head 
In your own time

As the sun goes down, wakinâ up my dreams 
And in my mind youâre with me once again 
Out of my heart, into your head 
And inside my heart thereâs a place for you 
And in my mind Iâm with you once again 
Out of my heart, into your head 

Out of my heart, into your head 
Out of my heart, into your head
