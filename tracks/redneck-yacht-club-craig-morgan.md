Im meetin' my buddies out on the lake 
We're headed out to a special place we love 
That just a few folks know
Theres no signin' up and no monthly dues
Take your Johnson, your Mercury, or your Evinrude and fire it up 
And meet us out at party cove 
Come on in the waters fine 
Just idle on over and toss us a line

Bass trackers, bayliners, and a party barge 
Strung together like a floatin' trailer park 
Anchored out and gettin' loud all summer long! 
Side by side there's five houseboat front porches 
Astro turf, lawn chairs, and tiki torches 
Regular joes rockin the boat, that's us! 

The Redneck Yacht Club 

Bermudas flip flops and a tank top tan 
he popped his first top at ten A.M. thats Bob 
he's our president
we're checkin' out the girls on the upper deck 
rubbin in the 15 spf its hot
everybody jumpin' in
later on when the sun goes down 
well pull out the jar and that ol' guitar 
and pass them around! 

Bass trackers, bayliners, and a party barge 
strung together like a floatin' trailer park 
anchored out and gettin' loud all summer long! 
side to side there's five houseboat frontporches 
astro turf, lawn chairs, and tiki torches 
regular joes rockin' the boat, that's us! 

The Redneck Yacht Club 

when the partys over and we're all alone we'll be makin' waves in a no wake zone!

Bass trackers, bayliners, and a party barge 
strung together like a floatin' trailer park 
anchored out and gettin' loud all summer long! 
side by side there's five houseboat front porches 
astro turf, lawn chairs, and tiki torches 
regular joes rockin' the boat, thats us!
