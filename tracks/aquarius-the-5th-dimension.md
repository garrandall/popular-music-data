When the moon is in the Seventh House
And Jupiter aligns with Mars
Then peace will guide the planets
And love will steer the stars

This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius
Age of Aquarius
Aquarius
Aquarius

Harmony and understanding
Sympathy and trust abounding
No more falsehoods or derisions
Golden living dreams of visions
Mystic crystal revelation
And the mind's true liberation
Aquarius
Aquarius

When the moon (when the moon) is in the Seventh House
And Jupiter (Jupiter) aligns with Mars
Then peace will guide the planets
And love will steer the stars

This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius
Age of Aquarius

Let the sunshine
Let the sunshine in
The sunshine in

Let the sunshine
Let the sunshine in
The sunshine in

Let the sunshine (oh let it shine)
Let the sunshine in (come on)
The sunshine in (now, everybody, just sing along)

Let the sunshine (let the sun shine on in)
Let the sunshine in (open up your heart)
The sunshine in (and let it shine on in)

(And when you are lonely) Let the sunshine
(Hey, let it shine) Let the sunshine in
(You got to open up your heart) The sunshine in
(And let it shine on in)

(And when you feel like you've been mistreated) Let the sunshine
(And your friends turn their back on you) Let the sunshine in
(Just open up your heart) The sunshine in
(And let it shine on in)

(You've got to feel it) Let the sunshine
(You've got to feel it) Let the sunshine in
(Ah, open up your heart) The sunshine in
(And let it shine on in)

(Now let me tell you one thing) Let the sunshine
(I want you to sing along with the 5th Dimension) Let the sunshine in
(Hey, and open up your heart) The sunshine in
(Ah, come on)

Let the sunshine (and let it shine)
Let the sunshine in (every day)
The sunshine in

(Hey, you've got to feel it) Let the sunshine
(You've got to feel it) Let the sunshine in
(When you open up your heart) The sunshine in
(You got to let the sun come on in)

(Now I see it in the morning) Let the sunshine
(And the rain in the evening) Let the sunshine in
(Open up your heart) The sunshine in

(Hey, when you're feeling low) Let the sunshine in
