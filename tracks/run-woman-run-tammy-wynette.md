Today's the day you're tellin' him that he's got to set you free
And that bein' one man's woman brings you down
But before you throw away what you think you don't want today
Don't give it up for the new life that you've found

Run woman, run
Go back to him and fix things up the very best you can
Tell him you missed him while you were gone
Run woman, run back to your man

You're a young girl, so understand, it's so hard to find a man
Who comes home every night to only you
You may not find true love again, so go home while you still can
And find a way to work it out with your man

Run woman, run
Go back to him and fix things up the very best you can
Tell him you missed him while you were gone
Run woman, run back to your man
Run woman, run back to your man
