Oh Lord, Jetson made another one

I been done ride through another nigga city
I got a brand new Draco with me
Clip got thirty-three, Scottie Pippen
Bitch nigga ain't heard of me, I got a Richard
Drippin', my sweatsuit Givenchy
I brought my strap in the party
And my diamonds offset like Cardi
Got a bad bitch with me, she a Barbie, huh
You don't wanna start with me

Got some hood niggas postin' in the Jordan
I have this nigga on back of a carton
Spend Larry Bird, thirty-three on Cartier
I got thirty-three bitches with me
I'ma float through the city sippin' on some chardonnay
Fuck it, I'ma buy it out the bar today
Fuck it, I'm buying out Barney's, yay
I'ma hang with the gangbangers
He only hang with the feds and the rats and the mice
If my young nigga pull up with the bullets
I'ma pull up with the strap, we gon' get him on sight
We gon' make a thriller like Mike
Car candy painted, Mike and Ike
And my diamonds lookin' like a light
I'ma fly a private like a kite
Got the Bentley coupe in China white

I been done ride through another nigga city
I got a brand new Draco with me
Clip got thirty-three, Scottie Pippen
Bitch nigga ain't heard of me, I got a Richard
Drippin', my sweatsuit Givenchy
I brought my strap in the party
And my diamonds offset like Cardi
Got a bad bitch with me, she a Barbie, huh
You don't wanna start with me

No, you don't wanna start with me (No, you don't wanna start with me)
Niggas pull up with Glock, AK's and TEC's (Uh-huh)
Runnin' up your whole block like a full court press
No, you don't wanna start with me (No, you don't wanna start with me)
No, you don't wanna start with me (No, you don't wanna start with me)
I know cold-hearted demons, they can smell your flesh (Uh-huh)
Walk up on a pussy nigga, shoot him dead in the chest
No, you don't wanna start with me (Nah)
Made a lot of plays, hood got J's
I kept me a bag with some hard in it (Hard in it)
Rappin', made a name
Now I get paid for a stage, I keep a guitar with me ('Tar with me)
Executive, ayy, black President Escalade
Bulletproof with a bar in it (Bar in it)
Go against it, it gon' be a hard ending (Hard ending)
I fucked and left, I hope it ain't no hard feelings (Nah)
Was broke as fuck, that's how I started drug dealin' (Drug)
Get some millions, it'll make a nigga love livin'
Andrew Jackson, my lil' niece and nephew love twenties
Me and Roddy got a get it out the mud business
Made a hundred racks on a C-day
Made a million dollars on a weekday
Fifteen thousand on a cheap day
Whippin' up dope like a deep dish
Junkies outside, no rebates

I been done ride through another nigga city
I got a brand new Draco with me
Clip got thirty-three, Scottie Pippen
Bitch nigga ain't heard of me, I got a Richard
Drippin', my sweatsuit Givenchy
I brought my strap in the party
And my diamonds offset like Cardi
Got a bad bitch with me, she a Barbie, huh
You don't wanna start with me

Hot girl like Arizona
Plug in Colombia, my diamonds in Africa
I'm like, "Fuck the DA"
Groupies been fuckin' my DJ
And shawty had an ass on her
