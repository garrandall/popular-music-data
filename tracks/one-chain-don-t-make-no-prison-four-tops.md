Just because in a moment of madness
I took advantage of your sweet love
Don't just hand me a lifetime of sadness
When there's so little I'm guilty of

One chain don't make no prison
Two wrongs don't make no right
One rain don't make no river
One punch don't make no fight

Can you spare me a little affection
Would that be askin' too much of you
Don't point love in another direction
I swear I'll make it all up to you

One chain don't make no prison
Two wrongs don't make no right
One rain don't make no river
One punch don't make no fight
Can you hear, baby?

There's a bed I'm keepin' empty for you
There's a lot I know I got to prove
Don't let a simple misunderstanding
Be a mountain that we can't move
Ooh, ooh, baby

One chain don't make no prison
Two wrongs don't make no right
One rain don't make no river
One punch don't make no fight

One chain don't make no prison
Two wrongs don't make no right
One rain don't make no river
One punch don't make no fight
