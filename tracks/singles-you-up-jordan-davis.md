I ain't heard you laugh like that in a long time
I wonder if you stopped his world like you did mine just now
I see you sippin' white wine instead of whiskey
And does he want you to be just a little more city?

Well, I'm sorry if I'm overstepping boundaries
I don't mean to be, but I've just got to tell you how I feel

If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough
I'ma be the first one calling you baby (baby)
If he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right
I'ma be the first one calling him crazy (crazy)
'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find
That the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now
No rush, but if he ever singles you up

He hasn't even looked your way since you walked in
But I can't help it that I can't take my eyes off of you

Your favorite song just came on and me and you were singing along
And he don't even know a single word

If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough
I'ma be the first one calling you baby (baby)
If he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right
I'ma be the first one calling him crazy (crazy)
'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find
That the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now
No rush, but if he ever singles you up
If he ever singles you up
I'ma be the first to call baby

Sorry if I'm overstepping boundaries
I don't mean to be, but I've just got to tell you how I feel

If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough
I'ma be the first one calling you baby (baby)
If he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right
I'ma be the first one calling him crazy (crazy)
'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find
That the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now
No rush, but if he ever singles you up
Oh, if he ever singles you up
If he ever singles you up
