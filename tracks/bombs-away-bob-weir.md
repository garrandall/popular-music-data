Bombs away
Well, I guess I'm back in love again
Well, hey now, and around we go
This will bring me ruin
Though I suppose it's pleasing
I've changed the eyes I gaze in
Still, she's just another girl
And I need more than a trade in
Guess I'll have to change the world
Strike up the band
Well, I believe I have this dance
Hey, raise that glass again, my friend
Yes, of course, I'm charming
But she's so easy
Well, I've changed the tune I dance to
In this gay old social whirl
But if I get a chance to
I might just change the world
It's just the same old movie
Been playing here for years
(Playing here for years)
I could use a change of scenery
But when I get there I'm still here
Coming soon
We'll have another day in paradise
At a theatre near you
And they'll be showing it forever
So let them keep parading
Give 'em all batons to twirl
For me, the splendor's fading

And it's still the same old movie
And I've seen it all before
Guess one more run through won't undo me
Hell, I'll just watch the show some more
Hey, some more, yeah, some more
Sit back and watch it some more
Guess I'll just watch the show some more
Hey, some more, yeah, some more
But I'd like to know what for
Hey, don't you worry what for
Yeah, I'd like to know what for
Guess you must know what I'm talking about
Bombs away (bombs away)
I guess I'm back in love again
(Love again)
Yeah, around and around we go
(Bombs away) bombs away
Guess I'm back in love again
(Love again) you got me
Round and round we go
Bombs away
Guess I'm back in love again
Round and around and around and around
It's love again (love again)
Yes, I guess I'm back in love again
Love again (love again)
Look out, I'm back in love again
