If your heart tells you so, that you should leave me
Don't try to forget, you and I never met
And before you fly, why can't you tell me why
You've forgotten all the words that you once said?

Long as I've got you there beside me
Long as you're there to stand and guide me
The love we share, no one can ever tear apart

Long as I've got this life I'm living
Long as it's you, the love I'm with then
I'll keep on callin' you sweetheart

If my love for you can't make you happy
Just open the door and you won't see me anymore
And before you fly, why can't you tell me why
You've forgotten all the words that you once said?

Long as I've got you there beside me
Long as you're there to stand and guide me
The love we share, no one can ever tear apart

Long as I've got this life I'm living
Long as it's you, the love I'm with then
I'll keep on callin' you sweetheart
And I'll keep on callin' you sweetheart
