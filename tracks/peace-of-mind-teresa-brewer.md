It comes from
Within your heart and soul
Peace of mind (peace of mind)
You're never too young or old
To find peace of mind (peace of mind)

You'll have to
Know what is wrong
To do what is right
Open your heart and
You'll see the light

And you'll find, yes, you'll find
Peace of mind (yeah, yeah)

It comes from
Within your heart and soul
Peace of mind (peace of mind)
It's something you
Cannot buy with gold
Peace of mind (peace of mind)

You'll have to
Know what you want
Know where you stand
Be true to yourself
It's all in your hands

And you'll find, yes, you'll find
Peace of mind (yeah, yeah)

You have to believe
In the Lord up above
And the ones that you love
The good that you do
Ss you pass this way
Will live for many a day

It comes from
Within your heart and soul
Peace of mind (peace of mind)
To find it, you must pay a toll
For peace of mind (peace of mind)

You have to give of yourself
Have brotherly love
Live by the book and the
Lord up above

And you'll find, yes, you'll find
Peace of mind (yeah, yeah)
And you'll find, yes, you'll find
Peace of mind (yeah, yeah)

Peace of mind
