All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet


All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
Best to run fast when I pump up this
Musical Glock and the shots go firing
No lyin', man I run this shit
Life's a movie man I run my script
Similar to hustlers that be runnin' their strips
I shouldn't say similar 'cause similar is equal
I ain't similar to niggas they ain't nothin' like this
I found a bottle with a note in there
It said "the worlds broken go repair it"
But it seems that no one cares
So I threw the bottle in the ocean, yea
I never chose my gift
My gift chose me, I don't owe y'all shit
Just God and a gun and a loaded up clip
And voice full of soul and it goes like this


All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet

Lights... Cameras
Life is just so scandalous
But still I paint with honesty
That's why they love what's on my canvas
I'm like Pete... Sampras
My service is so enchanting
I took a song by Foster The People and fostered it into Yonas' anthem
Nigga I'm a beast... Panther
And I don't know no answers
Thought I lost my soul, 15 years ago when lost my father to cancer
But I'm here... shit
And I refuse to quit
Just God and a gun and a loaded up clip
And voice full of soul and it goes like this


All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
