Big boy.. Big boy.. Big boy


I said give me two pairs
(cause) I need two pairs
So I can get to stomping in my air force ones
(Big boys) stomping in my air force ones


I like the all white high top strap with the gum bottom
(Big boy) there's something bout them that's dirty why I got 'em
(Big boy) I leave um strapped and laced and come up out um
(Big Boy) the last person who touched 'em I been shot 'em (big boy)


Now if you looked, and seen lime green forces and kiwi
(Big boy) you couldn't get this color if you had a personal genie
(Big boy) you now I keep it hip-hop
My niggas flip flop
(Big boy) yea my force ones and tip top
(Me) now form a flip flop, (big boy)


I like the limited edition to kaki and army green
(Big boy) patent leather pin stripe you should see how I do the strings
(Big boy) size twelve with the strap
Red and white with a cardinal cap
(Big boy) all flavors well it just depend
on when and (don't get me) where I am at (Big boy)


Don't get me wrong man
And Murphy lee ain't dumb man
(Big boy) cause if the shoe is on the shelf you should have some man
(Big boy) you can not sit up and tell me that you have none man
(Big boy) you may not have three or four but you got one man (big boy)




We up in footlocker I'm looking like I need those
(Big boy) ten in a half and if you got em give me two of those
(Big boy) I can tell she never seen Murphy Lee before
(Big boy) cause shes just standing there as if I'm shooting free throws
(Big boy) I said excuse me miss I only wanna buy shoes
(Big boy) she said I love you Murph especially in the white in blue
(Big boy) I said the white in blue sound nice make it twice
(Big boy) and I signed an (yo) autograph
(yo) "thanks for the advice" (big boy)


I keep it real dirty, dirty you know how I do
(Big boy) purple in gold with the Lakers the broncos the orange in blue
(Big boy) I like em floppy with ankle socks
lows mids and high tops, (big boy) With the clear sole,
But this tims and fat laces with it is cold
(Big boy) but when the winter goes (blhhha) and the hot summer flows
(Big boy) then its back to the all purpose with em and dots in the toe
(Big boy) then I'm stopping this dough that I'm spending fa sure
(Big boy) on them Nike air force "N" "E" behind the "O" (big boy)


O.. k li, I treat my shoe like my ride
(Big boy) chrome on the fat laces at what wood on the inside
(Big boy) spray candy on the swoosh
With the electric poofs
(Big boy) since I put a kit on the sole now I got a wider shoe
(Big boy) you see that low misk with the purple coop I'm driving them
(Big boy), (Kyjuan, where you getting them colors, are you dying them)
(Big boy) ten is my size in them
No point in tiein them
(Big boy) ain't no point in trying these on
You know I'm buying them (big boy)


Now don't nothing get the hype on first site like, white on whites
(Big boy) them three quarters them lows they all tyte
(Big boy) the only problem they only good for one night
(Big boy) cause once you scuff um you fucked up your whole night
(Big boy) whats my basis? The look up sto on his faces
(Big boy) this kids outrageous hes buying them by the cases
(Big boy) cause once I cop um gut um and switch the laces
(Big boy) they all purpose ya heard me kinda like my Dayton's (big boy)




I wore spurs at first now theres tape on them
(Big Boy) damn, when those come out so I write the date on them
(Big Boy) these Louies Vuitton ones, you gotta wait on them
(Big boy) I had to get em early so I spent more cake on them (big boy)


Look I'm trying to keep it up like a one minute man
(Big boy) while Ali on the Kawasaki two head bands
(Big boy) jewelry and all
(Wow) fish bowl in the mall
(Big Boy), (I got some fifteens) security buying shoes and all (big boy)


Now some time I get em free some time I gotta pay
(Big boy) walk in the mall and they now what I'm bout to say
(Big boy) gimme the black and platinum, and leather gray
(Big boy) ones in the back and (yo)
the pair you got on display (check), (big boy)


Now were the boxes were I keep mine (keep mine)
You should beep mine (big boy), (beep mine)
Maybe once or twice but never three times
(Big boy) I'm just a sneaker pro
I love pumas and shell toes
(Big boy) but cant nothing compare to a fresh crispy white pair (big boy)



Big boy.. Big boy.. Big boy
