You know I told you once tonight
That you could always speak your mind
You work so hard to say what's right
I watch you do it all the time

And when I called you on the phone
You said that I could be the one
But here I'm standing all alone
And you're out lying in the sun

Tell me, am I getting in too deep?
Every night I'm talking in my sleep
Lately I am been so confused
I really don't know what to do

Could you be the one I'm thinking of?
Could you be the girl I really love?
All the people tell me so
But what do all the people know?

You know I told you once tonight
That you could always speak your mind
You work so hard to say what's right
I watch you do it all the time

And when I called you on the phone
You said that I could be the one
But here I'm standing all alone
And you're out lying in the sun

Tell me, am I getting in too deep?
Every night I'm talking in my sleep
Maybe we're just holding on
To something that'll soon be gone

Could you be the one I'm thinking of?
Could you be the girl I really love?
All the people tell me so
But what do all the people know?

Do you think I'm blind to what you do?
Do you think I really care for you?
Or is it just another game that you and I pretend to play?

Do you think that we, oh, should let it show?
Do you think that we, oh, should let it go?
Or is it just another game that you and I pretend to play?

Tell me, am I getting in too deep?
Every night I'm talking in my sleep
Lately I am so confused
I really don't know what to do

Could you be the one I'm thinking of?
Could you be the girl I really love?
All the people tell me so
But what do all the people know?

All the people tell me so
But what do all the people know?

All the people tell me so
But what do all the people know?
