That's what girls are made for

To hug and to kiss
(That's what girls are made for)
To love and to miss
(That's what girls are made for)

You gotta hug 'em
(Hug 'em)
Then you kiss 'em
(Kiss 'em)

You gotta love 'em
(Love 'em)
Then you miss them
Wo, oh oh oh oh
(Miss them)

That's what girls are made for
(That's what girls are made for)

To hold and to squeeze
(That's what girls are made for)
To scold and to please, yeah
(That's what girls are made for)

I said, you gotta hold 'em
(Hold 'em)
Then you squeeze 'em
(Squeeze 'em)

If you scold 'em
(Scold 'em)
You gotta please them
And I know, I know, I know

That's what girls are made for
Wo ooh, wo ooh, yeah

Some can be true
Yes, and then again, they'll make you doubt 'em
Wo ooh oh, but ask me, ask me and I'm a here to tell you
That you just can't live without 'em
(That's what girls are made for)

To walk and hold hands with you
(That's what girls are made for)
You, you gotta make all of your plans with
(That's what girls are made for)

To walk with
(Walk)
And hold hand with
(Hands)

To make
(Make)
All of your plans with
Wo oh oh ooh oh, yeah

That's what girls are made for
(That's what girls are made for)

I said, you gotta hug 'em
(Kiss 'em)
Sometimes you gotta kiss 'em too
(Love 'em)

Yes you know you gotta love 'em with all your might
(Kiss 'em)
And I'm here to tell you, I know you gotta miss them
(That's what girls are made for)
