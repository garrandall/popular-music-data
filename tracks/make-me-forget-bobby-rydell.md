Make me forget her
With her lips on mine
Make me forget her
Kisses sweet as wine

Leave me this day and take
Her memories from my heart
Make me forget her
And fall for you

Make me forget the way
I held her near
Make me forget her
Now that you are here

Show me the way to leave
My cares so far behind
Make me forget her
And fall for you

No use resisting
The look that's in your eyes
Tried to fight but
I can't win so I gotta give in

Make me forget the one
I left behind
Make me forget her
Or else I'll lose my mind

Give me your love and take
The place here in my heart
Then I'll forget her
And fall for you

No use resisting
The look that's in your eyes
Tried to fight but
I can't win so I gotta give in

Make me forget the one
I left behind
Make me forget her
Or else I'll lose my mind

Give me your love and take
The place here in my heart
Then I'll forget her
And fall for you

Give me your love and take
The place here in my heart
Then I'll forget her
And fall for you
