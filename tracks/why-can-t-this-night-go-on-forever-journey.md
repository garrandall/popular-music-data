Lost in twilight, the memories
Precious moments, you and me
We've been old friends, all through the years
Picture postcards, sharing tears

What's in our hearts, there's never time, to say
Need you tonight, lover don't fade away
I've seen your city lights
As I walk away
Why can't this night... go on forever

Without love, we won't survive
Run together, we rule the night
Tell me secrets, oh that make you cry
Where's the laughter, we gotta try

What's in our hearts, there's never time to say
Need you tonight, lover don't fade away
Like a photograph
That time won't erase
Why can't this night... go on forever

Go on forever and ever... ever and ever
