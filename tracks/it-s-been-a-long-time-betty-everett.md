Been such a long time
Since I knew love
Been such a long time
Since I knew love

Say, hey, baby
Can I have your attention
I've been lonely longer
Than I care to mention

You look like the kind of guy
Who can really satisfy
I'm the one who needs you
And I can tell you why

Cause it's been so long
Since I been loved
It's been a long time, yeah
Since I been loved

You don't have to tell me
A whole lot of pretty words
I doubt if you could find one
I ain't never heard

You don't have to claim to
Be the very best
Cause all I need is
Love and respect

I said it's been a long time
Yeah, since I been loved
It's been a long time, yeah
Since I been loved

Oh, baby, I don't
Really mean to scare you
If I'm too aggressive
Honey, let me tell you

Ain't nobody needed me
Since I don't know when
So glad I found you
Say, where've you been

I said it's been a long time
Since I been loved
It's been a long time, yeah
Since I been loved
Oh, squeeze me all night

Yeah (been so long) so long, yeah
(Since I been loved) been too long
(Been so long) somebody needed me
(Since I been loved) hey, hey

(Been so long) been so long
(Since I been loved)
Somebody loved me
(Been so long) somebody needed me
(Since I been loved)

Somebody squeezed me
Somebody needed me
Somebody loved me...
