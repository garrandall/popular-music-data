We had broken up for good just an hour before
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
And now I'm staring at the bodies as they're dancing 'cross the floor
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
And then the band slowed the tempo and the music took me down
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
It was the same old song, with a melancholy sound
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah

They don't write 'em like that anymore
They just don't write 'em like that anymore

We'd been living together for a million years
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
But now it feels so strange out in the atmospheres
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
And then the jukebox plays a song I used to know
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
And now I'm staring at the bodies as they're dancing so slow
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah

They don't write 'em like that anymore
They don't write 'em like that anymore
Oh

Hey
Now I wind up staring at an empty glass
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
'Cause it's so easy to say that you'll forget your past
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah

They don't write 'em like that anymore, no
They just don't write 'em like that anymore
They don't write 'em like that anymore
They just don't write 'em like that anymore
They just don't, no, they don't
No, no, uh-uh
