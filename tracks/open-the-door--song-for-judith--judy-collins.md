Sometimes I remember the old days
When the world was filled with sorrow
You might have thought I was living but I was all alone
In my heart the rain was falling
The wind blew, the night was calling
Come back, come back, I'm all you've ever known

Open the door and come on in
I'm so glad to see you, my friend
You're like a rainbow, coming around the bend
And when I see you happy
Well, it sets my heart free
I'd like to be as good a friend to you, as you are to me

There were friends who could always see me
Through the haze their smiles would reach me
Saying okay, saying goodbye, saying hello
Soon I knew just what I was after
Was life and love, tears and laughter

Hello, my good friend
Hello, my darling
What do you know

Open the door and come on in
I'm so glad to see you, my friend
You're like a rainbow, coming around the bend
And when I see you happy
Well, it sets my heart free
I'd like to be as good a friend to you, as you are to me

I used to think it was only me feeling alone
Not feeling free to be alive to be a friend
Now I know we all have stormy weather
The sun shines through when we're together
I'll be your friend, right through to the end

Open the door and come on in
I'm so glad to see you, my friend
You're like a rainbow, coming around the bend
And when I see you happy
Well, it sets my heart free
I'd like to be as good a friend to you, as you are to me

Open the door and come on in
I'm so glad to see you, my friends
You're all like rainbows, coming around the bend
And when I see you happy
Well, it sets my heart free
I'd like to be as good a friend to you, as you are to me
