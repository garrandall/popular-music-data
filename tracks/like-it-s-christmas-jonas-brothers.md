The snow on the ground
The love in the air
The sleigh-bells are ringing
This is what it's all about
The fire is warm
The angels are singing
And I don't wanna miss

A single thing
Don't wanna put an end to all this cheer
But as long as you're with me
It's always that time of the year

You make every day feel like it's Christmas
Never wanna stop
Feeling like the first thing on your wish-list
Right up at the top
I can't deny what I'm feeling inside
Nothing fake about the way you bring me alive
You make every day feel like it's Christmas
Every day that I'm with you

Look at the lights
Twinkling bright
24/7
Every inch of Central Park
Is covered in white
This could be Heaven
And I don't wanna miss

A single thing
Don't wanna put an end to all this cheer
But as long as you're with me
It's always that time of the year

You make every day feel like it's Christmas
Never wanna stop
Feeling like the first thing on your wish-list
Right up at the top
I can't deny what I'm feeling inside
Nothing fake about the way you bring me alive
You make every day feel like it's Christmas
Every day that I'm with you

Every day that I'm with you

You make every day feel like it's Christmas
Never wanna stop
Feeling like the first thing on your wish-list
Right up at the top (And I can't deny)
I can't deny what I'm feeling inside
Nothing fake about the way you keep me alive
You make every day feel like it's Christmas
Every day that I'm with you

I can't deny what I'm feeling inside
No matter the reason, no matter the season
My heart'll keep beating, you better believe
You make every day feel like it's Christmas
Every day that I'm with you
(Oh uh-oh, oh uh-oh, oh uh-oh)
Every day that I'm with you
(Oh uh-oh, oh uh-oh, oh uh-oh)
Every day that I'm with you
