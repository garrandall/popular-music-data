She's Venus in blue jeans
Mona Lisa with a pony tail
She's a walking talking work of art
She's the girl who stole my heart

My Venus in blue jeans
Is the Cinderella I adore
She's my very special angel too
A fairy tale come true

They say there's 7 wonders in the world
But what they say is out of date
There's more than 7 wonders in the world
I just met number 8

My Venus in blue jeans
Is everything I hoped she be
A teenage goddess from above
And she belongs to me
(repeat)
