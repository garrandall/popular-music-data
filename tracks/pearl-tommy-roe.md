Pearl,
One summer night with you,
Will make up for the past,
And the nights I never knew,
Love, warm love.

Just light the match,
That lights my fire.
Pearl, I'm burnin' with desire,
With Pearl, with my girl.

You comb my hair,
With your fingertips,
Kiss me with your pretty little lips,
Oh Pearl,
You're my girl.

Pearl,
Your smile brings on a glow,
And deep inside my heart,
I begin to know,
Love, warm love.

You strike the match,
That lights my fire.
Pearl, I'm burnin' with desire,
Oh Pearl, you're my girl.

You comb my hair,
With your fingertips,
Kiss me with your pretty little lips,
Oh Pearl,
You're my girl.

You strike the match,
That lights my fire.
Pearl, I'm burnin' with desire,
Oh Pearl, you're my girl.

You comb my hair,
With your fingertips,
Kiss me with your pretty little lips,
Oh Pearl,
You're my girl.

You strike the match,
That lights my fire.
Pearl, I'm burnin' with desire,
Oh Pearl, you're my girl.

You comb my hair,
With your fingertips,
Kiss me with your pretty little lips,
Oh Pearl,
You're my girl.
