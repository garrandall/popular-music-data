Every time I call you on the phone
They tell me that you're not at home
But last night when I called you
Before I said hello

I could hear you
(Hear you)
Saying in the background
(Saying in the background)
Oh, yeah
(Tell him I'm not home)
You're never home

If by chance you found somebody new
And you don't know what to say or do
I'd feel better when I called you
If you asked me not to phone

Instead of saying
(Hear you)
Saying in the background
(Saying in the background)
Oh, yeah
(Tell him I'm not home)

(Not home)
Not home
(Not home)
Not home
(Not home)

Don't lie, don't lie
Baby, don't lie
If you don't want to talk to me, baby
Please tell me why

The next time
I call you on the phone
Don't let them tell me that you're not at home
I'd feel better if you told me that I am on my own

Instead of saying
(Hear you)
Saying in the background
(Saying in the background)
Oh, yeah
(Tell him I'm not home)

(Not home)
Not home
(Not home)
Not home
(Not home)
Not home
(Not home)

Every time I call you, baby
Somebody tells me that you're not home
And I getting sick and tired
Of the way you
