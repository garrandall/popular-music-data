I don't know dude
I think everybody's all jealous and shit 'cause I'm like the lead singer of a band dude
And I think everyone's got a fucking problem with me dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show
Because

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band


So I get off stage right drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks and I'm all like
"What's up, ladies? My name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer in D12 baby"
They're all like "Oh my god it's him"
"Becky oh my fuckin' god it's Eminem"
"I swear to fucking god dude you fucking rock"
"Please Marshall please let me suck your cock"
And by now the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
'Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude I just think you're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
'Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me because

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
My band 
Alright, okay, alright, give the mic man, okay dawg, giâcome on
Dude!
Give me this mic!
Ow, dude!


You just wanna see a nigga backwards, don't you?
ADAT? How come we don't rap on Pro Tools?
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in a van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, you's a liar
And no, I'm Swift (oh I thought you were Kuniva)
What the hell is wrong with our dressing room
'Cause our shit is looking smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, it's simple but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intact, tryna get on the map
Doin' jumping jacks while get whipped on my back


Look at Em little punk ass thinkin' he the shit
Yeah I know man by himself taking all the flicks
Hey I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
( No, I had an interview, not you two)
You gon' be late for soundcheck
I ain't gonna soundcheck
But our mics are screwed up and his always sound best
You know what man I'mma say something
Hey yo Em
( You got something to say?!)
Man no
I thought you was about to tell him off, man, what's up?
Man I'mma tell him when I feel like it, man shut up
And you ain't even back me up when we supposed to be crew
When I was bout to talk right after you
Aw, man, whatever
I swear, I swear man

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band


They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Went from sold out arenas to amusement parks
I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
Hey yo what's... Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear, "Hey dude I love your band."
We ain't a band bitch, we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent
And these guys acting funny every area code
( Proof carry my bag)
Bitch carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
(Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!)


God damn it I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
'Til Kon Artis slipped me some crack
"Lose Yourself" video I was in the back
"Superman" video I was in the back
For the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us the questions
Like "Who's D12? How we get started."
(But what about Eminem?)
Bitch are you retarded?
Anyway I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (hey sexy)
50 told me to do sit-ups to get buff
Did two and a half and couldn't get up
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
I'm 'bout to start a group with The Real Roxanne


Girl why can't you see you're the only one for me
And it just tears my ass apart to know that you don't know my name


Man, fuck this!
These chicks don't even know the name of my band...
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands... (Fuck Marshall)
'Cause once I blow I know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the
My band 
Roxanne
ShantÃ©, lesbian
Loves me

The hottest boy band in the world D12!


I'm the lead singer of my band, I get all the girls to take off their underpants
I'm the lead singer of my band, my salsa
Makes all the pretty girls want to dance
My salsa, well, look out for my next single, it's called "My Salsa"
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, my salsa
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants, my salsa
(Where'd everybody go?)
