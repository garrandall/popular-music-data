This ain't no place for losers
Or the innocent of mind
It's a full time job for anyone
To stay alive

The streets are set like boundaries
For a war that's never won
On a wasteland full of broken dreams
And hired guns


Shelter me, baby shelter me
When I lose control or my way home
Shelter me

I go to sleep with one eye open
The other holds my tears
In the darkness I can hide my heart
But not my fears

In the morning like a soldier
I'll approach the battleground
Another day, another dollar made
And the world goes round 


Shelter me, baby shelter me
When I'm sinkin' down, or losin' ground
Shelter me

Every time I tumble down
I wanna pack it up and leave this town
But when I finally get the nerve
And the lead out of my shoes
I think of you, I think of you


Shelter me, baby shelter me
When I lose control or my way home
Shelter me
