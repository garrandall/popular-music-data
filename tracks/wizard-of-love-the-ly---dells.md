We're off to see the wizard
Yeah-yeah, the wonderful wizzard of love
We're off to see the wizard
The wonderful wizzard of love
Because of the wonderful things
Wonderful things he does
Oh-oh-oh-h, wizard of love
If you need a girlfriend, ask the wizard of love
He'll send you an angel, an angel from above
One time I was lonely, and one time I was blue
I asked the wizard of love and he told me what to do
He put me on a cloud and he sent me up above
There I found an angel, an angel I could love
She told me that she knew me, that I've been talking of
Oh gee, since I met the wonderful wizard of love
If you need a girlfriend, ask the wizard of love
He'll send you an angel, an angel you can love
There's one thing I tell you, find the stars above
Please believe my story and you'll find the wizard of love
Lo-o-o-o-o-ove-ove...
