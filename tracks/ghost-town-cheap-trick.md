Well the streets are all crowded.
Lots of people around.
And there's music playing,
But I can't hear a sound.
Just the sound of the rain
Falling silently down.
Livin' ain't been livin'
Since you put me down.
Yeah life goes on around me every day,
But it might as well be half a million miles away.
It's like a ghost town without your love.
Like a ghost town without your love.
Like a ghost town, baby, can't you see?
It's a ghost town, until you come back to me.
oo, oo, till you come back to me.

Well. I wish I still had you.
Had you here next to me.
Baby, where did you go?
Baby, why did you leave?
Oh the world, it keeps turnin'
But it don't turn for me.
Without you in my life
My life ain't no place to be.

There's only lonely days and empty nights.
Ain't the same without you, baby, nothin' feelin' right.
Nothing's feeling right.

It's like a ghost town without your love.
Like a ghost town without your love
Like a ghost town, baby, can't you see?
It's a ghost town, until you come back to me.
Oo oo, till you come back to me.

Darlin', I wanna leave this town.
Don't wanna be around.
I'm gonna leave this town.

It's like a ghost town.

It's like a ghost town without your love.
Like a ghost town without your love.
Like a ghost town, baby, can't you see?
A ghost town, until you come back to me.
Oo oo till you come back to me.

It's like a ghost town.
It's a ghost town

Hey hey, it's like a ghost town, can't you see
It's like like a ghost town
Til you come, till you come back to me
Oo oo oo
Til you come, till you come back to me
