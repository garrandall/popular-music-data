Oh, baby, I found heaven when I found you
And this heaven is somethin' I don't wanna lose
I only know that if you ever said goodbye, I couldn't stand the pain
These eyes would cry, cry, cry like the rain

And the sun would have nowhere to shine
And the stars would all fall from the sky
Baby, please
Don't take away my heaven, oh, no

'Cause this world would stop turnin', I know
And I'd lose my whole world if you go
Baby, don't
Don't take away my heaven, oh, no

Oh, baby, I saw forever when I saw you
And if you left me, I can't imagine what I'd do
Now that I've gone and built my world around your love, I couldn't let you go
Don't ever say goodbye, no, don't, don't, don't ever go

'Cause the sun would have nowhere to shine
And the stars would all fall from the sky
Baby, please
Don't take away my heaven, oh, no

'Cause this world would stop turnin', I know (Yes, I know)
And I'd lose my whole world if you go (If you go)
Baby, please
Don't take away my heaven, oh, no

'Cause you might as well take my life from me
What good would a life without you be anyway (Anyway)
If you go away

Well, the sun would have nowhere to shine
And the stars would all fall from the sky (From the sky)
Baby, please
Don't take away my heaven, oh, no

'Cause this world would stop turnin', I know (Yes, I know)
And I'd lose my whole world if you go (If you go)
Baby, don't, no
Don't take away my heaven, oh, no

Don't take away my heaven, don't take away your love
Don't take away my world 'cause baby, I need your touch
Baby, don't
Don't take away my heaven, oh, no

Please don't take away my heaven
Please
Baby, don't, oh, no
Don't take away my heaven, oh...

Don't take away my heaven, don't take away your love
Don't take away my world 'cause baby, I need your touch
Baby, don't, oh
Don't take away my heaven, oh, no
