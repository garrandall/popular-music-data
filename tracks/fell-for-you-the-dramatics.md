Like a star, slipping out of place
Sliding from the sky, tumbling through space
When you touch my hand
I swear I feel... like I'm falling
(Falling, falling, falling)
Seems like I'm falling...
(Falling, falling, falling)

Like a wheel whirling, round and round
Rolling down a hill (rolling-down-a-hill)
Spinning on the ground
Your kisses make my dizzy (yeah)
In the head... and I'm falling
(Falling, falling, falling)
Falling...

Uh-oh girl
I think that I have fell for you
Uh-oh girl
I think that I have fell for you

I was a bird soaring, through the air
Flying fancy free, without a care
Until you clipped my wings
Now look at me... Oh, I'm falling
(Falling, falling, falling)
Yeah, falling
(Falling, falling, falling)

Oh here I go, down and down I go
I can't help myself
Girl you thrill me so
Yeah you blew my mind
And I know... that I'm falling
(Falling, falling, falling)
Yes, I'm falling
(Falling, falling, falling)

Uh-oh girl
I think that I have fell for you
Uh-oh girl
I think that I have fell for you

Oh, down, down, down I go (falling)
Oh, down, down, down I go (falling)
Oh, down, down, down I go (falling)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Uh-oh girl
I think that I have fell for you
(Seems like, seems like)
Uh-oh girl
I think that I have fell for you
Oh-oh girl
I think that I have fell for you...
