He;s my guy
I don't care what they say about him
He's my guy
I don't know what I'd do with out him
As long as he needs me
Right by his side i'll be
Cause he;s my guy

I pray that we;ll always be together
I pray that he'll love me forever

No one else
Could ever kiss me the way he does at night
And no one else
Could ever hold me the way he holds me

As long as he wants me
Right by his side i'll be
Cause he's my guy
