Wait until the war is over
And we're both a little older
The unknown soldier

Breakfast where the news is read
Television children fed
Unborn living, living dead
Bullet strikes the helmet's head

And it's all over
For the unknown soldier
It's all over
For the unknown soldier

Company
Halt
Present!
Arms!

Make a grave for the unknown soldier
Nestled in your hollow shoulder
The unknown soldier

Breakfast where the news is read
Television children fed
Bullet strikes the helmet's head

And it's all over
The war is over
It's all over
War is over

It's all over, baby
All over, baby
Oh, over, yeah

All over, baby
Woo, ha-ha

All over

All over, baby
Oh, whoa-yeah
All over
All over
Hey
