Sometimes (sometimes)
You make me wonder (wonder)
I get the blues (blues)
And then I wonder (wonder)
When you should
Hate me day and night
But when I'm home
Everything's alright
Who's the fool, me or you
Sometimes I wonder (wonder)
Can I get an answer
(Can I get an answer)
You sit there with a
Smile upon your face
What's on your mind (mind)
But you're just prancing
All over the place
When you should
Hate me day and night
But when I'm home
Everything's alright
Who's the fool, me or you
Sometimes I wonder (wonder)
You make me wonder (wonder)
Sometimes I wonder (wonder)
(Wonder, wonder, wonder)
If you should
Hate me day and night
But when I'm home
Everything's alright
Who's the fool, me or you
Sometimes I wonder (wonder)
You make me wonder (wonder)...
