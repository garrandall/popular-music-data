CHORUS
I've been lonely for so long
Don't seem like happiness will come along
I've been lonely for so long
Don't seem like happiness will come along

These ain't rain clouds over my head
Everybody's throwing rocks in my bed
Just can't seem to get ahead in life
Oh, nothing I do ever turn out right
Won't somebody help me please

CHORUS

I lay awake every night
Trying to figure out how to make things right
There's got to be a better way I know
To shake this monkey off cause he's making me so
Won't somebody help me please

CHORUS

Yes I know what it feels like to be lonely
To have your friends turn their backs on you
Yes I've been lonely
To never know the real meaning of peace of mind, yes

I lay awake every night
Trying to figure out how to make things right
There's got to be a better way I know
To shake this monkey off cause he's making me so
Won't somebody help me please

CHORUS
