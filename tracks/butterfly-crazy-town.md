Come my lady
Come come my lady
you're my butterfly
Sugar.baby

Come my lady
Come come my lady
you're my butterfly
Sugar.baby

Such a sexy,sexy pretty little thing
Fierce nipple pierce you got me sprung with your tongue ring
and I ain't gonna lie cause your loving gets me high
So to keep you by my side there's nothing that I won't try
Butterflies in her eyes and looks to kill
Time is passing I'm asking could this be real
Cause I can't sleep I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal

I can feel too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up
When these times get rough I was lost Now I'm found
Ever since you've been around
You're the woman that I want
So yo, I'm putting it down

Come my lady
Come come my lady
you're my butterfly
Sugar.baby
come my lady you're my
pretty baby I'll make your legs shake
you make me go crazy

Come my lady
Come come my lady
you're my butterfly
Sugar.baby
come my lady you're my
pretty baby I'll make your legs shake
you make me go crazy

I don't deserve you unless it's some kind of hidden message
to show me life is precious
Then I guess it's true
But to tell truth, I really never knew
T'll I met you... See I was lost and confused
Twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed but thought that I missed it

My lifestyle's wild I was living like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash paroled the police files
So yo. what' s happening now?
I see the sun breaking down into dark clouds
and a vision of you standing out in a crowd.

Come come my lady
you're my butterfly
Sugar.baby
come my lady you're my
pretty baby I'll make your legs shake
you make me go crazy

Come my lady
Come come my lady
you're my butterfly
Sugar.baby
come my lady you're my
pretty baby I'll make your legs shake
you make me go crazy

Hey sugar momma, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
Whatever tickles your fancy
Girl it's me and you like Sid and Nancy
So sexy...almost evil Talkin' about butterflies in my head
I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read but
you made me feel alive when I was almost dead

You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
and as far as I can see it don't get better than this
So butterfly, here is a song and it's sealed with a kiss
and a thank you miss

come and dance with me
come and dance with me
come and dance with me
so come and dance with me
uhhhhh ha uhhh ha

Come my lady
Come come my lady
you're my butterfly
Sugar.baby
come my lady you're my
pretty baby I'll make your legs shake
you make me go crazy

Come my lady
Come come my lady
you're my butterfly
Sugar.baby
come my lady you're my
pretty baby I'll make your legs shake
you make me go crazy

Come my lady
Come come my lady
you're my butterfly
Sugar.baby
come my lady you're my
pretty baby I'll make your legs shake
you make me go crazy

Come my lady
Come come my lady
you're my butterfly
Sugar.baby
come my lady you're my
pretty baby I'll make your legs shake
you make me go crazy

come and dance with me
come and dance with me
come and dance with me
come and dance with me
uhhhhhh ha uhhhhhh ha
come and dance with me
come and dance with me
come and dance with me
come and dance with me
come and dance with me
come and dance with me
come and dance with me
come and dance with me
