I went to see father of the bride, 
With a girl back home, 
We broke up before the sequal, 
So I went to that one all alone. 

I wondered who I'd wind up with, 
And what would our kids look like? 
Well I guess I got my answer, 
As I tuck them in at night. 

Heeeeey, I don't think dreams come any truer, 
Boys, welcome to the future.
