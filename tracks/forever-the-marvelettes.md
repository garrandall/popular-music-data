Darlin' forever, forever you can break my heart forever
If you want to I'll play the part of a fool, just to be with you forever
Darlin' forever, forever you can taunt me names
Take my love for granted, but I'll always be just a fool
If I, if I could be with you

I'll be your slave for the rest of, of my days
Love you more in so, so many ways just to be with you thrills me
Through and through
And darlin' forever, forever you can taunt me names
Take my love for granted, but I'll always be just a fool
If I, if I could be with you

Darlin' forever, forever
No matter what you say I do
I'll always, I'll always love you
