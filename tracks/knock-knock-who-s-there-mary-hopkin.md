Tears of rain
Run down my window pane
I'm on my own again
Good evening, sorrow

Sit and dream
Of how things might have been
And as I close my eyes
I get the strangest feeling

Knock, knock - "Who's there?"
Could this be love that's calling?
The door is always open wide

Knock, knock - "Who's there?"
Now as the night is falling
Take off your coat and come inside

Climb the stair
And then I say a prayer
For someone who could share
My situation

But instead
As I lay down my head
I have to leave it all
To my imagination

Knock, knock - "Who's there?"
Could this be love that's calling?
The door is always open wide

Knock, knock - "Who's there?"
Now as the night is falling
Take off your coat and come inside

Lalala lalala lalala...

Sit and dream
Of how things might have been
And as I close my eyes
I get the strangest feeling

Knock, knock - "Who's there?"
Could this be love that's calling?
The door is always open wide

Knock, knock - "Who's there?"
Now as the night is falling
Take off your coat and come inside

Take off your coat and come inside
