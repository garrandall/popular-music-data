Oh, Oh, Oh, hey

It's seventy two degrees
Zero chance of rain
It's been a perfect day
We're all spinning on our heels
So far away from real
In California

We watched the sunset from my car
We all took it in
And by the time that it was dark
You and me had something, yeah

And if this is what we've got
Then what we've got is gold
We're shining bright and I want you
I want you to know

The morning's on it's way
Our friends all say goodbye
There's nowhere else to go
I hope that you'll stay the night
Oh, you'll stay the night
Oh, yeah

We've been singing Billie Jean
Mixin' vodka with caffeine
We've got strangers stopping by
And though you're out of tune
Girl you blow my mind, you do
And all I'll say is I don't wanna say good night

There's no quiet corner
To get to know each other
And there's no hurry
I'm a patient man as you'll discover

Cause if this is what we've got
Then what we've got is gold
We're shining bright and I want you
I want you to know

The morning's on it's way
Our friends all say goodbye
There's nowhere else to go
I hope that you'll stay the night
Oh, you'll stay the night
Oh, yeah

Just like the song on my radio set
We'll share the shelter of my single bed
But it's a different tune that's stuck in my head
And it goes

If this is what we've got
Then what we've got is gold
We're shining bright and I want you
I want you to know

The morning's on it's way
Our friends all say goodbye
There's nowhere else to go
I hope that you'll stay the night

If this is what we've got
Then what we've got is gold
We're shining bright and I want you
I want you to know

The morning's on it's way
Our friends all say goodbye
There's nowhere else to go
I hope that you'll stay the night
