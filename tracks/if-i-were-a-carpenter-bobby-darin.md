If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady
Now would you marry me anyway?
Would you have my baby?

If I take on a tinkers trade, 
Would you still find me? 
Oh carryin' the pots I made
Followin' closer behind me

Save my love through loneliness
Save my love for sorrow,
Cause I have given you my ownliness, 
Give me part of your tomorrow 

If I work my hands in wood
Would you still love me? 
Ah, answer me babe, yes I would
I'd raise you high above me 

If I was a miller at a mill wheel grindin' 
Now would you miss your color box? 
& your soft shoes shining?

If I were a carpenter & you were a lady 
Girl, would you marry me anyway?
I want you have my baby

If I were a carpenter & you were a lady 
Now would you marry me anyway?
Won't you have my baby?
