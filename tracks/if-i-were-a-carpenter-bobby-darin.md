If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway?
Would you have my baby?

If a tinker were my trade
Would you still find me
Carrin' the pots I made
Followin' behind me

Save my love through loneliness
Save my love for sorrow
I'm given you my onliness
Come give your tomorrow

If I worked my hands in wood
Would you still love me?
Answer me babe, "Yes I would
I'll put you above me."

If I were a miller
At a mill wheel grinding
Would you miss your color box
And your soft shoe shining?

If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway?
Would you have my baby?
Would you marry anyway?
Would you have my baby?
