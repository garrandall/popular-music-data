Here come old flat top, he come grooving up slowly
He's got joo joo eye balls, he want holy roller
He's got hair down to his knees
He's got to be a joker, he just do what he please

He wear no shoe shine, he's got toe jam football
He's got monkey fingers, he shoot Coca Cola
He says, 'I know you, you know me'
Cause one thing I can tell you is you got to be free
Come Together, right now, over me

He bag production, he's got walrus gumboot
He's got Ono psycho, he want spinal cracker
He's got feet down below his knees
Hold you in his arms, still you can feel his disease
Come Together, right now, over me

He rollercoaster, he's got early warning
He's got Muddy Water, he want mojo filter
He says, 'One and one and one is three'
Got to be good looking 'cause he's so hard to see
Come Together, right now, over me
Ho, Come Together, yeah
Come Together, yeah...
