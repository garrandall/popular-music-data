A soldier boy has gone
Across the sea
I'm so sad and lonely
As I can be

I received a photo
Just the other day
Of a soldier boy
Who is far away

Said that he would come back
In a year or two
Told me not to cry
He'd always be true

He said
Fear not, my sweet
But have faith, in me
For I'll, return
From port, the sea

I will be so happy
On that grand and glorious day
When you come home to me
And the U.S.A.
