Everybody's looking for the perfect world
Where you could have everything your heart desires
The perfect boy will meet the perfect girl
And the perfect love will set the world on fire

Well what you gonna do, when one and one makes three
And a vision of the future is impossible to see
Nobody's perfect, not even a perfect fool
If you'll have faith in me
I'll keep faith with you

Ain't no livin' in a perfect world
There ain't no perfect world anyway
Ain't no livin' in a perfect world
But we'll keep on dreamin' of livin' in a perfect world
Keep on dreamin' of livin' in a perfect world

Everybody's got secrets, now you know that it's true
They talk about me and they'll talk about you
Something happens to the pledges of trust
Down through the years they begin to rust

Now here we are amid the tears and the laughter
Still waiting for our happily ever after
We'll keep on dreamin' as long as we can
Try to remember and you'll understand

Ain't no livin' in a perfect world
There ain't no perfect world anyway
Ain't no livin' in a perfect world
But we'll keep on dreamin' of livin' in a perfect world
Keep on dreamin' of livin' in a perfect world
