When I walk through a jam, no one knows who I am
Put your head on my chest, and I am Mr. Success
Never closed me a deal, all at once I'm a wheel
Just your head on my chest, and I'm Mr. Success
Why I once knew a worrying man, he was a hurrying man
With never a second to play
He had appointments to keep, people to meet
And it took thirty hours to make him a day
Not for me, not what I wanna be
Just your head on my chest, and I'm Mr. Success
(instrumental)
Why, I once knew a worrying man, he was a hurrying man
With never a second to play
He had appointments to keep, lots of people to meet
And it took thirty hours to make him a day
Not for me, not what I wanna be
Put my love to the test, that's when I'm at my best
Cause with you, pretty baby, standing by my side
I couldn't be a failure even if I tried
Cause you make me Mr. Success
