I wanna be your lady
(Rock me in the cradle of love)
I wanna be your baby
(Rock me in the cradle of love)

Hug me every night
(Oh yeah)
Cuddle me real tight
(Oh yeah)
Squeeze me with all your might
(Rock me in the cradle of love)

(Rock me...)
Oh yeah...
(In the cradle...)

(Rock me...)
Uh huh
(In the cradle...)
(Rock me...)
(Take me... take me...)
Take up to heaven above

(Say you'll be my boy, )
(Rock me in the cradle of love.)

Today'll be my birthday
(Rock me in the cradle of love.)
But? day
(Rock me in the cradle of love.)

Love is crazy, they say
(Oh yeah)
I was born today
(Oh yeah)

Won't you skate my way
(Rock me in the cradle of love.)
Oh baby...

(Rock me)
Oh yeah
(In the cradle)
Uh huh
(In the cradle)
(Take me... take me...)
Take up to heaven above

Come on now...
Take me?
Take me?
Say you'll be my boy
Rock me in the cradle of love

My baby
(Rock me)
Oh yeah
(In the cradle)
(Rock me)
Uh huh
(In the cradle)
(Take me... take me...)
Take up to heaven above

Oh yeah...
Kiss me every night
Cuddle me real tight
Squeeze with all your might
Rock me in the cradle of love

Everybody...
Rock me in the cradle of love
Come on now...
Rock me in the cradle of love
Come on now...
Rock me in the cradle of love
