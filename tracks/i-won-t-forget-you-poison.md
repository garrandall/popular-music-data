Late at night, I close my eyes
And think of how things could have been
And when I look back
I remember some words you'd said to me

It's better to have lost at love
Then never to have loved at all

I won't forget you, baby (I won't forget you)
Even though I could
I won't forget you, baby (I won't forget you)
Even though I should, yeah

Sometimes in my head
I can still see pictures of you
And I laugh to myself
When I think of all those crazy things that we used to do

Although miles come between us
Just between you and me

I won't forget you, baby (I won't forget you)
Even though I could
I won't forget you, baby (I won't forget you)
Even though I should, well

I should let you fade away
But that just wouldn't be me
Oh, baby

Although miles come between us
Just between you and me

I won't forget you, baby (I won't forget you)
Even though I could
I won't forget you, baby (I won't forget you)
Even though I should, yeah

I won't forget you, baby (I won't forget you)
Memories slowly fade
I won't forget you, baby (I won't forget you)
And all the plans we made

I won't forget you, baby
