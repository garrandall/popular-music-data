{Intro}

Well my pad is very messy
And there's whiskers on my chin
And I'm all hung up on music
And I always play to win
I ain't got no time for lovin'
Cause my time is all used up
Just to sit around creatin'
All that groovy kind of stuff

(But) I'm a man
Yes I am
And I can't help
But love you so
I'm a man
Yes I am
And I can't help
But love you so

Well if I had my choice of matter
I would rather be with cats
All engrossed in mental chatter
Moving where our minds are at
And relating to each other
Just how strong our wills can be
I'm resisting all involvement
With each groovy chick we see

Well I'm a man
Yes I am
And I can't help
But love you so
I'm a man
Yes I am
And I can't help
But love you so

I got to keep my image
While suspended from a throne
That looks out upon a kingdom
Full of people all unknown
Who imagine I'm not human
And my heart is made of stone
I never had no problems
And my toilet's trimmed with gold

I'm a man
Yes I am
And I can't help
But love you so
(Oh, no, no)
I'm a man
Yes I am
And I can't help
But love you so

{Chicago's Instrumental}

{Outro}
Oh, no, no, Yes, I am...
