Chorus:
Sinner man, has a reputation
Sinner man, known throughout the nation
Sinner man, that's his occupation
Yes, he's a sinner man!

There was a sinner man, who loved and ran away
He had a different girl, for every single day
He used to tell them lies, and alibis
He'd just pretend, and in the end
He'd leave 'em there, he didn't care
Because he was a sinner man! Ha, Ha!

Repeat Chorus

And then he met a girl, as pretty as could be
He thought he'd break her heart, as quick as one-two-three
He didn't realize, her flashing eyes, would hypnotize, did she surprise him
Could she be the girl who stole, the heart of a sinner man? Ha, Ha!

Repeat Chorus

The wedding day is planned, we're happy as can be
The pretty girl was you, the sinner man was me
La-la, la-la, la-la (repeat 4 times)
Repeat it for me everybody!(repeat la la's 4 times with echo of crowd)
