We may be big or small or black or white, eternally 
And black and white is you and me in a special light 
We may be young or old or in between, but this much I know
Together we can learn to grow 
In a world that's ever turning it's back on you
If you give it all away, 
make it mine, ine, ine, ine, mine
You are desire, everything you need 
I give you right or wrong 
And you are the woman that I 
base my whole existence on 
And when I get to you my 
desire is glowing in your light 

These are the golden years we get to live
we lead the way, tomorrow we can start today
in a special light
Love could be good or bad or in between 
but this much I learn
Baby, you and I can learn
In a world that's rearranging it's reality
If you give it all away 
make it mine, ine, ine, ine, mine 
You are desire, everything you need 
I give you right or wrong
And you are the woman that I 
base my whole existence on 
And when I get to you my 
desire is glowing in your light
And it's nice to light a fire 
when it's cold outside 
If you give it all away 
make it mine, ine, ine, ine, mine
You are desire, everything you need
I give you right or wrong
And you are the woman that I 
base my whole existence on 
And when I get to you my 
desire is glowing in your light
