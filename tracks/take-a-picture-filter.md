Awake on my airplane, awake on my airplane
My skin is bare, my skin is theirs
Awake on my airplane, awake on my airplane
My skin is bare, my skin is theirs
I feel like a newborn
And I feel like a newborn
Awake on my airplane, awake on my airplane
I feel so real


Could you take my picture?
'Cause I won't remember
Could you take my picture?
'Cause I won't remember
Could you take my picture?
'Cause I won't remember
Could you take my picture?
'Cause I won't remember, yeah


I don't believe in, I don't believe in
In your sanctity, your privacy
I don't believe in, I don't believe in
Sanctity, a hypocrisy
Could everyone agree that
No one should be left alone?
Could everyone agree that
They should not be left alone? Yeah
And I feel like a newborn
And I feel like a newborn
(Kicking and screaming)


Could you take my picture?
'Cause I won't remember
Could you take my picture?
'Cause I won't remember
Could you take my picture?
'Cause I won't remember
Could you take my picture?
'Cause I won't remember, yeah


Hey dad, what do you think about your son now?
Hey dad, what do you think about your son now?


Could you take my picture?
'Cause I won't remember
Could you take my picture?
'Cause I won't remember
Could you take my picture?
'Cause I won't remember
Could you take my picture?
'Cause I won't remember
Could you take my picture?
'Cause I won't remember
Could you take my picture?
'Cause I won't remember, yeah
