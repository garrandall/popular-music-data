All the folks down in Lynchburg, Tennessee
Been working hard for good ol' boys like me
I don't wanna be the one to tell 'em
That stuff that they been selling
Ain't working like it should
But I damn sure wish it would


Whiskey's supposed to drown a memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey

Maybe it's the bar or the stool I'm on
Maybe it's the band and this sad ol' song
That keeps me buying rounds
That keeps me turning down
Any girl that wants to dance
And you ain't giving them a chance

Whiskey's supposed to drown a memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey

Girl I'm livin' proof
That 80 proof
Ain't got a shot
At touching you

But whiskey's supposed to drown a memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is whiskey's supposed to drown a memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey
Yeah the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey

All the folks down in Lynchburg, Tennessee
Been working hard for good ol' boys like me
