Yeah, Brooklyn New York, stay focused
Its ya girl, Babs Bunny, the streets first lady
Diddy I see you baby

Yall niggas done met ya match
I'm somthin like a pimp you bust i bust back
I game dudes got 'em callin me wifey
My stomach stay flat babys mothas dont like me
Chicks is heated then I give my ice see
Im the knockout queen yall hos dont wanna fight me
Sexy brown skin complexion
Cuz shits in my purse its a deadly weapon yeah
I dont pay for nothin at all i even get free dutches at the corner store
Shot caller dudes stop as soon as i see 
Babs bunny the black jet queen of the week huh
Im fire just what the thugs desire
Got a high pitched flow MC Mariah
When i walk down the streets niggas squeak their tires
Got every club for more we passin street flyers
I been there VIP its a short night
With a bottle of haze my weave is so tight
Im ready for some action hands in the air 
Crystal over here in the club no beer
Struttin bad girl i do it for nothin
Tight dickies shirt with a pop top button
Babs repeat it im somethin that the rap game needed
Thorough bread plus i stay weeded


Im in and out the magazines back to the tv shows
Attendin business meetings with the 40s and my 34s 
Every days an episode all because im episode
Just like rats they wanna know where my cheddar flows
Everydays like valentine hah i keep it rollin
Never made a dime for rhyme yeah
I make the people no my people dont beleive it though
Someone has been leavin no words sayin cold you stack on no you serpico
Cuz you headin through the line makin and carryin their flow
So it must be those freaky po pos i hope
They better pray they dont run no chrome or your momma gonna be singin that song


What you say Freddy P ya heard me
Its all chopper city ya heard me
Your little brother ya heard me
I representin the band ya dig to the death
New Orleans Third Wall Magnolia
Let me catch a nigga bootin up ima be like whats hap nigga
I crush balls and it a mothafuckin fact nigga
You know what type of shit im on i let the mack hit ya
You cant box my squad our left jabs quicka
Then any bitch nigga that tries to come against us 
All my sistas i promise to make it part of my agenda to get ya
You know what im sayin we see them ninjas
Hoppin off of they cottage and choppin you down like timber
You can try to stop me i will end ya
Shit my killer instincts like cinder
Im a bad boy you better make it
Make it out fifty
Chopper city by position i can paint you a picture


Hey yo Choppa I dig you like a fuckin shovel man
You see its ness the enforcer from the band man
We the hottest thing since microwave popcorn dog
This is real its about to go down like this hey yo
Puffin on sour deezys you know it aint legal when i never been to iraq but packin desert
eagles on me
Call me a liar but the fires back
Bad boy empire is where the fires at
I got the sean john truck with the tires to match
The whole hood on fire the wires tapped
Ok this part of the deal 
Bounty huntas all on my heals
Lookin for me huh so were in devilles
I take the planes trains automobiles boats
Overseas passport to brazil
Survival with the fittest nigga i talk it i live it
Gotta talk before you walk any nigga can get it

 
We Da Band!!!
For the family ya know
Elliot Ness Me ah Hold it down till death
Before the annaducks what me tell ya
Dylan Dyllanger!
Guerrilla family, West Indian hype
Me ah say somethin like dis
Come look

Yo me, me nah born rich, me was poor n needy
But SEE, man ah die now me nah bloodclot beegie
See ME, shot ya high up
You nah see me see see
Little more me a'go wire up with set CCC
She check all of me guns n rocs
Thieft it thieft
Of all me points legalize cause we need it
Treat the people like "come out" "yes sir"
Rule the people with me guns
Like moses rule with him rod
BUMBA CLOT!
We not the warriors with Ouigi
Me men right chest hard and
We love the almighty
Me nah burn out me truck see
Peal back the back seat
Shot every area of fools who nah like me (WAH!)
Dem losers got a new night see
My glock come out when its time f' be black sheep
Ask them, if you cant see Da Band is me famly
If you disrespect
