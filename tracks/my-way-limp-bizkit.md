Special (check my melody, my melody)
You think you're special, you do
I can see it in your eyes, I can see it when you laugh at me
Look down on me and walk around on me


Just one more fight about your leadership
And I will straight up leave your shit
'Cause I've had enough of this
And now I'm pissed, yeah!


This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way or the highway
This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way or the highway


Check out, check, check out, check, check, check
Check out my melody
Check out, check out, check, check
Check out my melody
Check, check check, check check, -check check, check check
Check out my melody
Check, check out, check, check out, check, check out, check, check
Check out out my melody


Just one more fight about a lot of things
And I will give up everything
To be on my own again
Free again, yeah!


This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way or the highway
This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way or the highway


Someday you'll see things my way
'Cause you never know, no, you never know
When you're gonna go
Someday you'll see things my way
'Cause you never know, no, you never know
When you're gonna go


Check, check out, check, check out my melody
Check out, check, check out, check, check out, check, check, check
Check out my melody
Check, check, check my melody, check, check out my melody


Just one more fight and I'll be history
Yes, I will straight up leave your shit
And you'll be the one who's left
Missing me, yeah!


This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way or the highway
This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way or the highway


Someday you'll see things my way
'Cause you never know, no, you never know
When you're gonna go
Someday you'll see things my way
'Cause you never know, no, you never know
