Energy, digging on your energy 
Energy, digging on your energy 
Energy, digging on your energy. energy 


Boy, I'm digging on your energy (Energy) 
And I'm digging what you telling me (Telling me) 
So I wrote this little melody (Melody) 
And dedicate it to my favorite lover 


I'm lying in bed 
There's thoughts in my head 
I'm thinking bout you 
Over and over and over and over again 
What can I tell you, you got me so twisted 
Tossing and turning 
Over and over and over and over again 
So I wrote a song tonight (Tonight) 
You weren't begging me to write (To write) 
Tell me is it cool tonight (Tonight) 
To let you know what's on my mind 


Boy, I'm digging on your energy (Energy) 
And I'm digging what you telling me (Telling me) 
So I wrote this little melody (Melody) 
And dedicate it to my favorite lover 


Rain and shine sleet and snow 
Couldn't stop the way we flow 
Welcome to my miracle 
And I'm digging on your lyrical 
Your melody is my remedy 
Squeeze to my Hennessey 
The one to call when I'm sipping for 
With the candy coated Tennessee 
Just make a wish. 
And let's make it official with your boy Baby Bash with some heavenly bliss 
Because your kisses on my lips, girl I'm ready to roll 
With so vicious and bubblicious, the energy's throwed 


Boy, I'm digging on your energy (Energy) 
And I'm digging what you telling me (Telling me) 
So I wrote this little melody (Melody) 
And dedicate it to my favorite lover 


Boy, you know that I dig you 
I fell in love when I met you 
I love the way you make me feel 
Your energy is something real (Fa. sho.) 
Boy, I love the way (I love the way) 
You make me feel (You make feel) 
Is something bout you loving me 
Can't do without your energy 


Boy, I'm digging on your energy (Energy) 
And I'm digging what you telling me (Telling me) 
So I wrote this little melody (Melody) 
And dedicate it to my favorite lover 


Energy, digging on your energy 
Energy, digging on your energy 
Energy, digging on your energy. energy
