Can't believe this mess I'm in
Don't know if I'm coming or going
Got my heart spread too thin
Lately the strain has been showing

I need a new direction
Don't wanna share my affection

One lover, one lover at a time
That's enough for me
One lover, one lover at a time
You're all I need

One lover
One lover
One lover
Hoo, hoo, hoo

My phone is ringing off the wall
Get confused which lover is calling
I can't take this anymore
I saw you and I started falling

You are my new direction
Gonna give you all my affection

One lover, one lover at a time
Not two, not three, not four
One lover, one lover at a time
I don't need anymore

One lover
One lover
One lover
Hoo, hoo, hoo

One lover
Just one lover
One lover
Hoo, hoo, hoo

From now on safety
In numbers won't do
If you'll be there for me
I'll be there for you

One lover
One lover
One lover
Hoo, hoo, hoo

One lover, one lover at a time
That's enough for me
One lover, one lover at a time
You're all I need

One lover
One lover
One lover
Hoo, hoo, hoo

One lover, one lover at a time
Not two, not three, not four
Just one lover, one lover at a time
I don't need anymore

One lover
One lover
One lover
Hoo, hoo, hoo

One lover
Just one lover
One lover
Hoo, hoo, hoo...
