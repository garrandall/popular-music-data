Steam from a summer rain drop
rising off the blacktop
I wipe the sweat from my brow
Steam from my radiator
I'm late and getting later
should be at your place by now
Bank sign says a hundred and two
but that ain't nothin' when I'm next to you

There's fire in your fingertips 
flames in your touch
desire in your burnin' lips
I can't get enough
Today was a scorcher
but I'll go you one better
tonite when we get together
we're going to make steam

I dream of you there on my front steps
sunnin in that short dress
hotter than the the Texas heat
Seems I'm never gonna get there
traffic's going no where 
but when I feel you next to me
girl the things that you know to do
just makes my heat index go through the roof

There's fire in your fingertips 
flames in your touch
desire in your burnin' lips
I can't get enough
Today was a scorcher
but I'll go you one better
tonite when we get together
we're going to make steam

Girl the things that you know to do
just make my heat index go through the roof
