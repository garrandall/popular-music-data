Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open doors
What are you hoping for?
Do you know?


Once we were standing still in time
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds
You knew I loved you, but my spirit was free
Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me


Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?


Now, looking back at all we've passed
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answers to those questions can be?


Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open doors
What are you hoping for?
Do you know?
