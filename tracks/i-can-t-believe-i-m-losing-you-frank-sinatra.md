Is this the way our romance ends
I got the message when you said we could be friends
My love was true, I can't believe I'm losing you
We played a game, of give and take
But I stopped playing when my heart began to break
What can I do, I can't believe I'm losing you
Wish I could erase every little trace of love that's in the heart of me
Every little dream, every little scheme, will always be a part of me
There's nothing left for me to do
We've passed the point of no return, and now we're through
It's still too new, I can't believe I'm losing you
It's still too new, I can't believe I'm losing you
