Iâm drunk off your kiss
For another night in a row
This is becoming too routine for me
But I did not mean to lead you on
And itâs all right to pretend
That we still talk
Itâs just for show, isnât it
Itâs my fault that it fell apart

Just maybe
You need this
And I didnât mean to
Lead you on

You were everything I wanted
But I just can't finish what I've started
Thereâs no room left here on my back
It was damaged long ago
Though you swear that you are true
I still pick my friends over you
(My friends over you)

Please tell me everything,
That you think that I should know
About all the plans you made
When I was nowhere to be found
And itâs all right to forget
That we still talk
Its just for fun, isnât it
Itâs my fault that it fell apart

Cuz maybe you need this
And I didnât mean to
Lead you on

You were everything I wanted
But I just can't finish what I've started
Thereâs no room left here on my back
It was damaged long ago
Though you swear that you are true
I still pick my friends over you
(My friends over you)

Just maybe you need this
You need thisâ¦
And I didnât mean to
Lead you on

You were everything I wanted
But I just can't finish what I've started
Thereâs no room left here on my back
It was damaged long ago
Though you swear that you are true
I still pick my friends over you
