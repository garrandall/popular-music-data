OOH WEE!
Don't guess why
Over what you're doing
Don't guess why
Over what you're doing
If I keep loving you
My life would be ruined

I done got hip, uh
Of your running round
Done got hip, looka here
To your running round
But do you know one thing
I'm gonna put you down

OH, get it together
Ha, get it together, looka here
Get it together, get it together, OH

You said that you wanted
A brand new bag
You said you wanted
Looka here, a brand new bag
But you, you were just jiving
You wanted to be a drag
You dropped out of school
Before you got it down
You hear me?
You dropped out of school
Before you got it down
Now you ain't hip
You're the biggest fool in town

Oh, get it together
Get it together, get it together
Get it together
OH, Maceo!

Go now, ha
Do the Underdog
Get on a log
Do the Underdog
Get on a log
Get it, get it, shotgun
Sock it to 'em
Haha, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Good God, one more time
One more time now
One more time

Now looka here
Maceo, let me tell 'em about this little bit
Let me tell 'em about this little bit

You may dance good
You may have fast feet
You may dance good
You may have fast feet
But you ain't slick
Your business is in the street
Now looka here, Maceo
Bring it down but I want you to blow
Lemme hear you, uh, get it
All right now, come on, OW

Sometime, sometime
Sometime, sometime
Oh, good God, hey, uh
Play it, play it
