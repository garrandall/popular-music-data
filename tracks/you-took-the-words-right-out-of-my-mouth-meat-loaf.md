On a hot summer night
Would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?
 Will he offer me his mouth?
 Yes
 Will he offer me his teeth?
 Yes
 Will he offer me his jaws?
 Yes
 Will he offer me his hunger?
 Yes
 Again, will he offer me his hunger?
 Yes
And will he starve without me?
 Yes
 And does he love me?
 Yes
 Yes
 On a hot summer night
Would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?
 Yes
 I bet you say that to all the boys


It was a hot summer night
And the beach was burning
There was fog crawling over the sand
When I listen to your heart
I hear the whole world turning
I see the shooting stars falling
Through your trembling hands

You were licking your lips
And your lipstick shining
I was dying just to ask for a taste
We were lying together in a silver lining
By the the light of the moon
You know there's not another moment
Not another moment
Not another moment to waste

You hold me so close that my knees grow weak
But my soul is flying high above the ground
I'm trying to speak but no matter what I do
I just can't seem to make any sound

And then you took the words right out of my mouth
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me
You took the words right out of my mouth
And I swear it's true
I was just about to say I love you
And then you took the words right out of my mouth
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me
You took the words right out of my mouth
And I swear it's true
I was just about to say I love you

Now my body is shaking like a wave on the water
And I guess that I'm beginning to grin
Oh we're finally alone and we can do what we want to
The night is young
And Ain't no-one gonna know where you
No-one gonna know where you
No-one's gonna know where you've been
You were licking your lips
And your lipstick shining
I was dying just to ask for a taste
We were lying together in a silver lining
By the the light of the moon
You know there's not another moment to waste

And then you took the words right out of my mouth
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me
You took the words right out of my mouth
And I swear it's true
I was just about to say I love you
And then you took the words right out of my mouth
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me
You took the words right out of my mouth
And I swear it's true
I was just about to say I love you
