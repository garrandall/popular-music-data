Nothing really matters till you make it
Nothing really matters till in the end
The world still turns and life you learn
Nothing really matters in the end

That's the way of the world

You sure about this baby
That's the way of the world
Cos I been feeling down for a while now
That's the way of the world
I better do something real soon
That's the way of the world
I want out of this life
Maybe even commit suicide

Nothing really matters till you make it
All right all right
Nothing really matters till you say
The love's all gone but I keep headstrong
And nothing really matters in the end

That's the way of the world

I don't think that's me baby
I just feeling down boy
That's the way of the world
Got no friends in my life boy what's goin' on here
That's the way of the world
Things had better change for me and they have to change fast

Nothing really matters till you show it
Nothing really matters till you say
I tell you now when you let me down
Nothing really matters in the end

That's the way of the world

I needed you but you could not be found
That's the way of the world
Strolling through problems a dozen or down (?)
That's the way of the world
Trying to solve of these troubles within
That's the way of the world
Stuck in the middle of life it's a shame
That's the way of the world

That's the way of the world

I hope what you saying to me is real true baby
Bout time we should get on
That's the way of the world
Things had better change for me and they have to change fast

Nothing really matters till you make it
Right on
Nothing really matters in the end
The world still turns and life you learn
But nothing really matters in the end
That's the way of the world
Nothing really matters in the end
That's the way of the world
The end
The end
Right OK baby
The end
That's the way of the world
It's about time we jammed a little right
The end
End
That's the way of the world
The end
OK baby
Yeah

If you've got a problem in the back of your mind
Express your feelings you never know what you'll find
Whether it be your mother your lover or a friend
Let them help you through to the end
End
End
End

That's the way of the world
Don't worry bout a thing
That's the way of the world
Still in love as it begins
That's the way of the world
The way of the world
That's the way of the world
That's the way of the world
Don't worry bout a thing
That's the way of the world
Still in love as it begins
That's the way of the world
The way of the world
That's the way of the world
That's the way of the world
Don't worry bout a thing
Still in love as it begins
That's the way of the world
The way of the world
That's the way of the world
