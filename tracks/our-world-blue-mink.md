Suddenly I woke this morning, the light was dawning on me
Tumbling from my bed and scratching my head, I looked up to see
Bright new day
Here to stay

People all around, not making a sound but taking the air
Trying not to choke, breathing the smoke, they leave everywhere
Blowin' away
Bright new day

The world is ours
The place we all share together
And all together there's such a lot to share

Let's keep our world
A fair place for people to live in
And we can live in a world for which we care

Why does everybody try to rule everything
That really matters in this world today?
Don't they know that this is our world
This is our world

Everbody's joking and the kids are busy smoking
People really must be joking if they think it doesn't happen here
Yes, it happens in our world

Suddenly it seems the ocean has lost its motion for me
Troubled water's gently gliding a black cloud sliding by me
Wish I knew
What to do

Take a look ahead, don't bury your head like an ostrich below
Everybody stop, blowing the top of a wonderful world
Everyone
Having fun

The world is ours
The place we all share together
And all together there's such a lot to share

Let's keep our world
A fair place for people to live in
And we can live in a world for which we care

The world is ours
The place we all share together
And all together there's such a lot to share

Let's keep our world
A fair place for people to live in
And we can live in a world for which we care

Why does everybody try to rule everything
That really matters in this world today?
Don't they know that this is our world
This is our world

Everbody's joking and the kids are busy smoking
People really must be joking if they think it doesn't happen here
Yes, it happens in our world

Nanana
It's our world
It's our world

Nanana
It's our world
It's our world

Nanana
It's our world
It's our world
