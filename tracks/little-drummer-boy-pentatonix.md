Come they told me
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum


A newborn King to see
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum


Our finest gifts we bring
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum


To lay before the king
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum

So to honor Him
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
When we come


Pum-pum-pum-pum
Pa-rum-pum-pum


Little baby
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
I am a poor boy too
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum


I have no gift to bring
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
That's fit to give our King
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum


Shall I play for you
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum


Mary nodded
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
The ox and lamb kept time
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum


I played my drum for Him
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
I played my best for Him
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum


Then He smiled at me
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
Me and my drum
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh


Come they told me
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
A newborn King to see
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum

Me and my drum
Me and my drum
Me and my drum
Me and my drum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
