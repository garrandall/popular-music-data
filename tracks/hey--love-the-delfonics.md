Hey love (Hey love)
Turn your head around (Turn your head around)
Take off that frown, you're in love
Wake up (Wake up)
Open the door (Open the door)
Don't cry no more, you're in love


You know we need each other
And you, girl, yes, you should be lovin' me
Let's go on together
We'd be happy, so happy


Hey love (Hey love)
It's a new day (It's a new day)
No time to play, we're in love
Wake up (Wake up)
In your own way (In your own way)
Then you might say, "You're in love"


People dance around you
And you're so pretty
Hey, I love you
Yeah, yeah


Hey love (Hey love)
Turn your head around (Turn your head around)
Take off that frown, you're in love
Wake up (Wake up)
In your own way (In your own way)
Then you might say, "You're in love"


(Hey love, hey love)
Hey love (Hey love, hey love)
Hey love (Hey love, hey love)
Hey love (Hey love, hey love)
Hey love (Hey love, hey love)
Hey love (Hey love, hey love)
Hey love (Hey love, hey love)
(Hey love)
Hey love (Hey love, hey love)
Hey love (Hey love, hey love)
Hey loveâ€“
