I said, baby, baby, baby
Things ain't like what they used to be
Since you've been gone, yeah
Everything wrong is happening to me

And, baby, baby, baby
Lord, I just can't seem to find my way
Cause since you've been gone, baby
Every day is a cloudy day

And, oh, when your
Friends mention your name
The hurting comes back
Again and again and again

And when I pass the house
That we used to stay
It's lonely and vacant
And, Lord, I'm the same old way

So, baby, baby, baby
Lord, I just can't get over losing you
Since you've been gone baby
I just can't seem to find my way

I just can't get over losing you
(Can't get over losing you)
Just don't know what to do with myself
(Can't get over losing you)
I just can't find my way, baby
(Can't get over losing you)
Lord, I just don't know
What to do with myself
(Can't get over losing you)
