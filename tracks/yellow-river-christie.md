So long, boy you can take my place
Got my papers, I've got my pay
So pack my bags and I'll be on my way
To Yellow River

Put my gun down, the war is won
Fill my glass, now the time has come
I'm going back to the place that I love
At Yellow River

Yellow River, Yellow River
Is in my mind and in my eyes
Yellow River, Yellow River
Is in my blood, it's the place I love

Got no time for explanations, got no time to lose
Tomorrow night you'll find me
Sleeping underneath the moon
At Yellow River

Cannon fire lingers in my mind
I'm so glad that I'm still alive
And I've been gone for such a long time
At Yellow River

I remember the nights were cool
I still can see the water pool
And I remember the girl that I knew
At Yellow River

Yellow River, Yellow River
Is in my mind and in my eyes
Yellow River, Yellow River
Is in my blood, it's the place I love

Got no time for explanations, got no time to lose
Tomorrow night you'll find me
Sleeping underneath the moon
At Yellow River

Yellow River, Yellow River
Is in my mind and in my eyes
Yellow River, Yellow River
Is in my blood, it's the place I love
