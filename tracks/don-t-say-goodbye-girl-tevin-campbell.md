Baby, don't stand there in the doorway
With all your bags ready to go
Baby, sit down and let's talk it over
Oh, I need to know


What do you think you're gonna find?
(No man can treat you sweeter)
What are you looking for?
(A place where the grass grows greener)
The world is cold out there
(I'm the one who really cares)


Don't say goodbye, girl
Take a look inside and read my mind, girl
Everything I do, I do for you
Don't leave me crying, crying


Maybe my crime is carin' bout'cha, yeah yeah
Wanting you close by my side
Baby, you need some space around you
Some room to fly


Don't ever think I'll hold you back
(My love will lift you higher)
And when you call my name
(I'll be there right beside ya)
Together we'll be fine
(Give this love another try)


Don't say goodbye, girl
Take a look inside and read my mind, girl
Everything I do, I do for you
Don't leave me crying, crying
Oh, baby


Baby, you know you mean the world to me
(You mean the world to me, yeah)
I never loved nobody the way that I love you
(Never loved nobody)
The way it feels, oh, when I'm close to you
(Feels so good, baby)
When I'm holding you, touching you
(Hey...)


What do you think you're gonna find?
(No man can treat you sweeter)
Just wait and you will see
(We'll make the grass grow greener)
The world is cold out there
(I'm the one who really cares)


Don't say good...don't say goodbye, girl
Hey, take a look inside and read my mind, girl
Everything I do, I do for you
Don't leave me crying, crying
Don't say goodbye, girl
Take a look inside and read my mind, girl
Everything I do, I do for you
Don't leave me crying, crying
Don't say goodbye, girl
Take a look inside and read my mind, girl
Everything I do, I do for you
Don't leave me crying, crying
Don't say goodbye, girl
Take a look inside and read my mind, girl
Everything I do, I do for you
Don't leave me crying, crying
