You're all I need to get by, oh, yeah
I said you're all I need to get by

Like the sweet morning dew, I took one look at you
And it was plain to see you were my destiny
With my arms open wide, I threw away my pride
I'll sacrifice for you, dedicate my life for you
I will go where you lead always there in time of need
And when I lose my will
You'll be there to push me up the hill

There's no, no looking back for us
We got love sure enough, that's enough
You're all
You're all I need to get by

Like an eagle protects his nest, for you I'll do my best
Stand by you like a tree, dare anybody to try and move me
Darling in you I found strength where I was torn down
Don't know what's in store but together we can open any door
Just to do what's good for you and inspire you a little higher
I know you can make a man out of a soul that didn't have a goal

Cause we, we got the right foundation
And with love and determination
You're all
You're all I want to strive for and do a little more
All, all the joys under the sun wrapped up into one
You're all, You're all I need to get by
