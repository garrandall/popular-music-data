I've been hit, I've been hit by your love
I've been hit, I've been hit by your love
I've been hit, I've been hit by your love
I've been hit

I've been hit by your love and it's all that I see
So much happiness now belongs to me
I've been hit by your love for the very first time
And I know you're the one, baby you're mine

It turns out that we like the same movies
We even like the same songs, baby
I can't believe that there is someone like you
I can't believe I waited so long

What we have is something so special
A connection I hope won't be broken too soon
I just need you to tell me you love me
So I can be with you

I've been hit by your love and it's all that I see
So much happiness now belongs to me
I've been hit by your love for the very first time
And I know you're the one, baby you're mine

I never thought that I needed another
Until the day I saw you
Everything I said I didn't want was
In front of me and so true

When you smiled I knew I was in for it
Your sweet face told me all that I needed to know
From that moment I knew what love was
And I hope that you did too

I've been hit by your love and it's all that I see
So much happiness now belongs to me
I've been hit by your love for the very first time
And I know you're the one, baby you're mine

I've been hit, I've been hit by your love
I've been hit, I've been hit by your love
I've been hit, I've been hit by your love

I'm hit, I'm hit by love, I'm hit
I'm hit by your love, baby
I'm hit, I'm hit by love, I'm hit
I'm hit by your love, baby

I've been hit, I've been hit by your love
I've been hit, I've been hit by your love
I've been hit,

I've been hit by your love and it's all that I see
So much happiness now belongs to me
I've been hit by your love for the very first time
And I know you're the one, baby you're mine

I've been hit by your love and it's all that I see
So much happiness now belongs to me
I've been hit by your love for the very first time
And I know you're the one

I've been hit, I've been hit by your love
I've been hit, I've been hit by your love
I've been hit, I've been hit by your love
I've been hit

I've been hit, I've been hit by your love
I've been hit, I've been hit by your love
I've been hit, I've been hit by your love
I've been hit
