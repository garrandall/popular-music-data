Come on, baby, let's do the twist
Come on, baby, let's do the twist
Take me by my little hand and go like this

Yeah, twist, baby, baby
Twist, ohyeah, just like this
Come on, little miss, and do the twist

My daddy is sleepin' and mama ain't around
Yeah, daddy's just sleepin' and mama ain't around
We're gonna twisty, twisty, twisty
Till we tear the house down

Come on and twist, yeah, baby
Twist, ohyeah, just like this
Come on, little miss, and do the twist, yeah

Yeah, you should see my little sis
You should see my, my little sis
She really knows how to rock
She knows how to twist

Come on and twist, yeah, baby
Twist, ohyeah, just like this
Come on, little miss, and do the twist

Yeah, rock on now
Yeah, twist on now, twist
