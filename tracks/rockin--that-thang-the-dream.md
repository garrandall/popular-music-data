Girl I'm in love with you baby
And I want you to know
That I'm hooked on your body
And I'm trying to be yours

Radio Killer!
Yessir!
We beat it up like gorillas
Trick, where you at?
Oh Yessir! Bikini Hour!


She going right
She going left
I had her here, to myself
I got on it
Like I want it
She rode to beat like a pony
Cameras up
Cameras flash
I'm tipsy trying to last
I want to change her name to Mrs. Nash
There's nothing left to say


Cause she rockin' that thang like
Oh, oh, oh, oh ay oh, oh, oh, oh
She rockin' that thang like
Oh, oh, oh, oh ay oh, oh, oh, oh
There's nothing I can say
She rockin' that thang like
Oh, oh, oh, oh ay oh, oh, oh, oh
She rockin' that thang like
Oh, oh, oh, oh ay oh, oh, oh, oh
There's nothing I can say
She just rockin' that thang like


We out the door
We in the car
She under my shirt
I'm under her bra
She said take it if you want it
Then we made love till the first light of morning
So we did it, done it, get it, got it
Oh, oh, oh baby
She said do it till my body don't move baby
Oh baby


She rockin' that thang like
Oh, oh, oh, oh ay oh, oh, oh, oh
She rockin' that thang like
Oh, oh, oh, oh ay oh, oh, oh, oh
There's nothing I can say
She rockin' that thang like
Oh, oh, oh, oh ay oh, oh, oh, oh
She rockin' that thang like
Oh, oh, oh, oh ay oh, oh, oh, oh
There's nothing I can say
She just rockin' that thang like


Girl I'm in love with you baby
And I want you to know
That I'm hooked on your body
And I'm trying to be yours
Hear my words for their worth
Ain't just trying to get in your clothes
Ok I'm lying
But damn you fine
And umm!
(She rockin' that thang like)
Oh yeah!


Oh, oh, oh, oh ay oh, oh, oh, oh
She rockin' that thang like
Oh, oh, oh, oh ay oh, oh, oh, oh
There's nothing I can say
She rockin' that thang like
Oh, oh, oh, oh ay oh, oh, oh, oh
She rockin' that thang like
Oh, oh, oh, oh ay oh, oh, oh, oh
There's nothing I can say
She just rockin' that thang like

Take me I'm yours shorty
As we rock to the left
Rock to the right
Lend me your body
I'mma rock it all night
Don't leave us on this floor shorty
The door's to the left
I'm parked on the right
Tell my niggas holla back
Tell your girls good night

The way you're rocking that up in this club
I swear you're gonna make a nigga fall in love, love
The way you're rocking that up in this club
I swear you're gonna make a nigga fall in love, love
