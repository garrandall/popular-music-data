Jealous Heart, oh, jealous heart stop beating
Can't you see the damage you have done
You have driven him away forever
Jealous Heart, now I'm the lonely one.
I was part of ev'rything he planned for
And I know he loved me at the start
Now he hates the sight of all I stand for
All because of you, old jealous heart.
Jealous heart, why did I let you lead me
When I knew the end would bring me pain
Now he'sgone, he's gone and found another
Oh, I'll never see my love again.
Through the years his memory will haunt me
Even though we're many miles apart
It's so hard to know he'll never want me
'Cause he heard your beating jealous heart.
Many times I trusted you to guide me
But your guiding only brought me tears
Why oh why must I have you inside me
Jealous heart, for all my lonely years
