Don't look for me to be waiting
At the booth we always shared
Don't look for me to walk in the door
Tonight, I won't be there

You can dance and flirt all you want to
You can smile at guys who stare
You've teased my heart
Just once too often
Tonight, I won't be there

I'm tired of playing fool to you
The way you make me do
And I'm convinced there's just no sense
In wasting time on you

It's too late to say that you're sorry
You can cry but I don't care
Your tears can fall
On some other shoulder
Tonight, I won't be there

Your tears can fall
On some other shoulder
Tonight, I won't be there
