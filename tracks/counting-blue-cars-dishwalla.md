Must have been mid afternoon
I could tell by how far the child's shadow stretched out
And he walked with a purpose in his sneakers, down the street
He had many questions like children often do

He said, "Tell me all your thoughts on God
And tell me am I very far?"

Must have been late afternoon
On our way the sun broke free of the clouds
We count only blue cars, skip the cracks in the street
And ask many questions like children often do

We said, "Tell me all your thoughts on God
'Cause I would really like to meet her
And ask her why we're who we are
Tell me all your thoughts on God
'Cause I am on my way to see her
So tell me am I very far, am I very far now?"

It's getting cold picked up the pace
How our shoes make hard noises in this place
Our clothes are stained
We pass many cross-eyed people
And ask many questions
Like children often do

Tell me all your thoughts on God
'Cause I would really like to meet her
And ask her why we're who we are
Tell me all your thoughts on God
'Cause I am on my way to see her
So tell me am I very far, am I very far now?
(Tell me all your thoughts on God)
Am I very far now?
Am I very far now?
(Tell me all your thoughts on God)
(Tell me all your thoughts on God)
