Well, Billy rapped all night about his suicide
How he'd kick it in the head when he was twenty-five
Speed jive, don't want to stay alive
When you're twenty-five
And Wendy's stealing clothes from Marks & Sparks
And Freddy's got spots from ripping off the stars from his face
Funky little boat race
Television man is crazy saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
Oh, Man, I need TV when I've got T.Rex
Oh brother, you guessed
I'm a dude, dad


All the young dudes (Hey dudes!)
Carry the news (Where are you?)
Boogaloo dudes (Stand up, c'mon)
Carry the news
All the young dudes (I want to hear you)
Carry the news (I want to see you)
Boogaloo dudes (I want to talk to you, all of you)
Carry the news (Nowwww)


Now Lucy looks sweet cause he dresses like a queen
But he can kick like a mule, it's a real mean team
But we can love
Oh yes, we can love
And my brother's back at home with his Beatles and his Stones
We never got it off on that revolution stuff
What a drag, too many snags
Now I've drunk a lot of wine and I'm feeling fine
Got to race some cat to bed
Oh is that concrete all around
Or is it in my head?
Yeah
I'm a dude, dad


All the young dudes (Hey dudes)
Carry the news (Where are you?)
Boogaloo dudes (Stand up)
Carry the news (ha ha)
All the young dudes (I want to hear you)
Carry the news (I want to see you)
Boogaloo dudes (I want to relate to you)
Carry the news
All the young dudes (What dudes?)
Carry the news (Let's hear the news, c'mon)
Boogaloo dudes (I want to kick you, ha ha ha ha)
Carry the news


(Hey, you there)
All the young dudes
(With the glasses)
Carry the news (I want you)
Boogaloo dudes (I want you in the front)
Carry the news (Now)
(Now, you're his friends)
All the young dudes (Now you bring him down)
('Cause I want him)
Carry the news (Ha, ha, ha)
Boogaloo dudes (I want him right here)
(Bring him, c'mon)
Carry the news (Bring him)
(Ha, ha)
(Here you go)
All the young dudes
(I’ve wanted to do this for years)
Carry the news
(There you go!)
Boogaloo dudes
(How’d it feel?)
Carry the news
