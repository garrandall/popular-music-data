Well, Billy rapped all night about his suicide
How he kick it in the head when he reached twenty-five
Speed jive, don't want to stay alive
When you're twenty-five
And Wendy's stealing clothes from Marks and Sparks
And Freedy's got spots from ripping off the stars from his face
Funky little boat race

Now, the television man is crazy saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
Oh man, I need TV when I got T Rex
Oh brother you guessed

All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news

Now Lucy looks sweet cause she dresses like a queen
And she can kick like a mule, it's a real mean team
But we can love, oh yeah, we can love
And my brother's back at home with his Beatles and his Stones
We never got it off on that revolution stuff
What a drag, too many snags

Now I've drunk a lot of wine and I'm feeling fine
Gonna race some cat to bed
Is this concrete all around
Or is it in my head?
Oh brother you you guessed

All the young dudes (Hey, dudes!)
Carry the news (Stand up!)
Boogaloo dudes (I want to kiss you!)
Carry the news

All the young dudes (I want to talk to you!)
Carry the news (I want to see you, dudes!)
Boogaloo dudes (laughter)
Carry the news (I want to kiss you!)

All the young dudes (Stand up!)
Carry the news (I want to kiss you!)
Boogaloo dudes (laughter)
Carry the news (I want to talk to you, dudes!)

All the young dudes (Stand up!)
Carry the news (What dudes!)
Boogaloo dudes (I want to kiss you!)
Carry the news (Ahh, I want to see you, dudes!)

All the young dudes (Ah, I want to talk to you!)
Carry the news (What dudes!)
Boogaloo dudes (I want to kiss you!)
Carry the news (I want to kiss you)

All the young dudes (Yeah, do you know what I'm...what I'm talking about?)
Carry the news (I want to kiss you)
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news (Stand up!)

All the young dudes (I want to talk to dudes!)
(I want to see!)
