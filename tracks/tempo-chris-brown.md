Baby, I'ma switch this shit up
Fuck that older shit, yeah

We ain't in a rush, girl, it's just us, girl (no)
Let me know wassup, girl, wassup, girl? (Girl, yeah)

Switch up the tempo, switch it up (oh)
Can I switch up the tempo?
Switch up the tempo, push it up, hold up

I know that life moves too quick for ya, sometimes (sometimes)
We should pull up to the kick-back, smoke one with me one time (one time)
Tell me 'bout all the freaky secrets, all them troubles that you got on your mind (got on your mind)
Just bring them to life (bend it up), put that shit on a film and watch it back on rewind (hold up)

We ain't in a rush, girl, it's just us, girl (push, girl, it's just us, girl)
Let me know wassup, girl, wassup, girl? (Ooh yeah)
'Cause I'm tryna throw it down, eat it up, go down, eat it up (throw it down, ooh)
Take it down, down, down, down, then I'ma beat it up (up)

Let me switch up the tempo, switch it up (let me, girl)
Let me switch up the tempo, switch it up (ooh, ooh)
Let me switch up the tempo, switch it up (baby)
I wanna switch up the tempo, switch it up (oh, woah)
Can I step tempo on ya? (Tempo)
Switch up the tempo, switch it up (tempo)
Can I switch up the tempo? (Tempo, oh)
Switch up the tempo, push it up, hold up (yeah, yeah)

I know that you wanna change your place, girl, I got that for you (oh)
I know you need a good D, girl, I'ma drop that on you (oh, oh woah)
Girl, you just like me, I know that you nasty, I know that you with it (yeah)
Girl, don't be shy, just admit it, as soon as you do, you can come through and get it for real (yeah)

We ain't in a rush, girl, it's just us, girl (wanna feel you up, gon' feel)
Let me know wassup, girl, wassup, girl? (Wassup, baby)
'Cause I'm tryna throw it down, eat it up, go down, eat it up (throw it down, eat it up, eat it up)
Take it down, down, down, down, then I'ma beat it up (up)

Let me switch up the tempo, switch it up

Let your hair down and just show that to me
Only your love, just give it to me, throw that to me
Don't play around, just throw that back, give it all to me

We ain't in a rush, girl, it's just us, girl
