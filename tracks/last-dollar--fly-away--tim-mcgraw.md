1-2-3 Like a bird I sing
Cause you've given me the most beautiful set of wings
I'm so glad you're here today
Cause tomorrow I might have to go and fly away
Hey!


I'm down to my last dollar
I've walk right though my shoes
Just a small reminder of the hell that I've gone through
But look at me still smiling
As I'm wondering what I'll do
Since I ain't got nothing
I've got nothing to lose
Everybody say "HaHaHa, HaHaHa"
My friends are always giving me
Watches, hats, and wine
That's how I know this is serious
That's how I know it's time
I don't have to worry
About things that I don't have
Cause if I ain't got nothing
I've got nothing to hold me back


1-2-3 Like a bird I sing
Cause you've given me the most beautiful set of wings
I'm so glad you're here today
Cause tomorrow I might have to go and fly away
Fly away, fly away


There's nothing that's worth keeping me
From places I should go
From happyville to lovingland
I'm gonna tour from coast to coast
I'm leaving everything behind
There's not much that I need
Cause If I ain't got nothing
I'm footloose and fancy free



Look at me so free
Nothings holding me down (down)
Look at me so free
Can't keep my feet on the ground

1-2-3 Like a bird I sing
Cause you've given me the most beautiful set of wings
I'm so glad you're here today
Cause tomorrow I might have to go and
1-2-3 Like a bird I sing
Cause you've given me the most beautiful set of wings
I'm so glad you're here today
Cause tomorrow I might have to go and fly away
Fly away, Fly Away, Fly away, Fly away
Fly away!!
