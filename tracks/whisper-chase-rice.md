What if I rolled the dial to the right
And let that minor chord steer this night
What if I slid a match and lit the wick
What if I shut ya up with my lips on your lips
Let the gravel of my voice drown out all the noise

With a whisper tonight (tell me right now)
These thoughts that no one else should hear
Cut through my lips, dance in your ear
Till light (lay me on down) 
Comes burnin' through that window pane
Your hair's painting that pillow case
Answer me baby with nothing but your body
Your hands got a crazy way of talkin' naughty
Let the other side of these walls
The ups and downs of these halls, oh
Hear what can start with a whisper

And what if that kitchen table gets a wreck
Yeah plates crashing down with my breath on your neck
What if that $75.94 you spent at the store
Takes the rest'a the night off as it slides to the floor

With a whisper tonight (tell me right now)
These thoughts that no one else should hear
Cut through my lips, dance in your ear
Till light (lay me on down) 
Comes burnin' through that window pane
Your hair's painting that pillow case
Answer me baby with nothing but your body
Your hands got a crazy way of talkin' naughty
Let the other side of these walls
The ups and downs of these halls, oh
Hear what can start with a whisper
With a wisper yeah

Let the gravel of my voice drown out all the noise

With a whisper tonight (tell me right now)
These thoughts that no one else should hear
Cut through my lips, dance in your ear
Till light (lay me on down) 
Comes burnin' through that window pane
Your hair's painting that pillow case
Answer me baby with nothing but your body
Your hands got a crazy way of talkin' naughty
Let the other side of these walls
The ups and downs of these halls, mhm
Hear what can start with a whisper
With a whisper yeah
With a whisper
Yeah hear what can start with a whisper
