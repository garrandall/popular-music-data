Oowee, oowee, oowee, oowee
That's how my heart sings
Each time that you kiss me, I'm in orbit without wings!

Oowee, oowee, oowee, oowee
That's how my love sings
It sounds like the magic of the church bell when it rings!

Every second, every minute
There's a new excitement in it
Every time I hear you sighin'
I take off and I' flyin'

You're my baby and I show it
I want all my friends to know it
So, when everyone comes knockin'
Our love song will be rockin'

Oowee, oowee, oowee, oowee
That's how my heart sings
Each time that you kiss me, I'm in orbit without wings!

Oowee, oowee, oowee, oowee
That's how my love swings
It sounds like the magic of the church bell when it rings!

Darling, there's no use pretending
Love like ours is never-ending
If I'm flyin' high above you
It means how much I love you

Touch me and I get that feelin'
Hug me and I'm on the ceilin'
When I'm up there and I'm sailin'
Here's what you'll hear me playin'

Oowee, oowee, oowee, oowee
That's how my heart sings
Each time that you kiss me, I'm in orbit without wings!

Oowee, oowee, oowee, oowee
That's how my love swings
It sounds like the magic of the church bell when it rings!

Oowee, oowee, oowee, oowee
That's how my heart sings
Each time that you kiss me, I'm in orbit without wings!
