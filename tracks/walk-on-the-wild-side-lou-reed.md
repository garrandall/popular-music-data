Holly came from Miami, FLA
Hitch-hiked her way across the USA
Plucked her eyebrows on the way
Shaved her legs and then he was a she
She says: Hey, babe
Take a walk on the wild side
She said: Hey, honey
Take a walk on the wild side

Candy came from out on the Island
In the backroom she was everybody's darlin'
But she never lost her head
Even when she was giving head
She says: Hey, babe
Take a walk on the wild side
Said: Hey, babe
Take a walk on the wild side
And the colored girls go: Doo do doo do doo do do doo

Little Joe never once gave it away
Everybody had to pay and pay
A hussle here and a hussle there
New York City's the place where they said: Hey, babe
Take a walk on the wild side
I said: Hey, Joe
Take a walk on the wild side

Sugar Plum Fairy came and hit the streets
Lookin' for soul food and a place to eat
Went to the Apollo
You should've seen 'em go go go
They said: Hey, sugar
Take a walk on the wild side
I said: Hey, babe
Take a walk on the wild side
All right, huh

Jackie is just speeding away
Thought she was James Dean for a day
Then I guess she had to crash
Valium would have helped that bash
Said: Hey, babe
Take a walk on the wild side
I said: Hey, honey
Take a walk on the wild side
And the colored girls say: Doo do doo do doo do do doo
