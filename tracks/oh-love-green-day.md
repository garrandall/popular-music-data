Oh love
Oh love
Won't you rain on me tonight
Oh life
Oh life
Please don't pass me by
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop when the red lights flash
Oh ride
Free ride
Won't you take me close to you


Far away
Far away
Waste away tonight
I'm wearing my heart on a noose
Far away
Far away
Waste away tonight
Tonight my heart's on the loose


Oh lights
And action
I just can't be satisfied
Oh losers
And choosers
Won't you please hold on my life
Oh hours
And hours
Like the dog years of the day
Old story
Same old story
Won't you see the light of day


Far away
Far away
Waste away tonight
I'm wearing my heart on a noose
Far away
Far away
Waste away tonight
Tonight my heart's on the loose


Talk myself out of feeling
Talk my way out of control
Talk myself out of falling in love
Falling in love with you


Oh love
Oh love
Won't you rain on me tonight
Oh ride
Free ride
Won't you take me close to you


Far away
Far away
Waste away tonight
I'm wearing my heart on a noose
Far away
Far away
Waste away tonight
Tonight my heart's on the loose
Far away
Far away
Waste away tonight
I'm wearing my heart on a noose
Far away
Far away
Waste away tonight
Tonight my heart's on the loose


Tonight my heart's on the loose
Tonight my heart's on the loose
