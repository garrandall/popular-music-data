It's right that I should care about you,
And try to make you happy when you're blue.
It's right, it's right to feel the way I do.
Because, because, I love you.

It's wrong to say I don't think of you,
'cause when you say these things
You know it makes me blue.

Give me one kiss and I'll be happy,
Just, just to be with you.
Give me, give me a chance to be near you.
Because, because, I love you.

Give me one kiss and I'll be happy,
Just, just to be with you.
Give me, give me a chance to be near you.
Because, because, I love you.

Because, because, I love you...
