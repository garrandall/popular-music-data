Hey baby,
Come over here and sit down and let me? To you for a minute.

I don't want you to think I'm conceited or anything,
But I've been through quite a few changes.
So if you really want me,
You just got to take my love.

I've been in love before,
Before I met you.
So you know if you really, really, really want my love,
This is what you got to do:
Take it,
Take it,

Take it with kindness,
And sweet consideration.
Take it with true love.
'Cause I don't need another infatuation, baby.
No, I don't need another infatuation, baby, no!

And if you want it,
Come on give it to me.
If you want it,
Girl, you've got to take it from me.

If you want it,
You've just got to take my love.
Take it with kindness,
And sweet consideration.

Take it with true love,
'Cause I don't need another infatuation, baby.
No!
I don't want another... Aw baby!

If you want it, you know you got to take it,
Take another lovin', baby.
Oh darlin'!
I need your lovin' baby, baby, baby!

I don't want another infatuation.
Take my love, darlin', darlin', darlin'!
No, no, no!

Ohhh, baby!
You've got to take my lovin'!
Take it!
