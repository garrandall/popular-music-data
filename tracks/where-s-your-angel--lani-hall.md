So you shut the light
And you say goodnight
And you turn away
You don't face the truth
Got an attitude
Just another day

Run from my thoughts
To the arms of sleep
Talk is no friend
Because it never keeps

Where's
Your angel
To hold you. Dreams don't fly away
My angel
Come back, come home with me to stay

Oh I can see
You're unsure of me
And you fantasize
You'll be left alone
While I play around
And make up my mind

Don't be afraid
Cause I'd never leave
It's known for me if you don't believe

Where's
Your angel
To hold you. Dreams don't fly away
My angel
Come back, come home with me to stay
Today

It's not my peep hole
I'm not looking for the door
And you know I won't let you go

Where's
Your angel
To hold you. Dreams don't fly away
My angel
Come back, come home with me to stay
My angel
Hold you. Dreams don't fly away
My angel
Come back come home with me to stay
