Le la, le la, le la loo
I'm in love with you

My daddy is a great lover
With big strong arms to hold
His love is real, his love is strong
And his heart's as good as gold

And I'm a chip chop
Chip off the old block
Le la lou la dee, chip chop
Chip off the old block
Mmm, yeah, that's me

When I was a boy, paw slapped his chest, this is what he said:
"If ever I saw one in my life, this is a thoroughbred"

My boy's a chip chop
Chip off the old block
Le la lou la dee, chip, chop
Chip off the old block
Mmm, yeah, that's me

I couldn't take my eyes off you
When you went strolling by
Paw smiled and said he wouldn't be mine
If he didn't have a roving eye
I know my paw be true to maw
All her live long days
And I'll be true to you, darling
'Cause I got my pappy's ways

'Cause I'm a chip chop
Chip off the old block
Le la lou la dee, chip, chop
Chip off the old block
Mmm, yeah, that's me
