Make it easy on yourself
Oh, breaking up is so very hard to do

If you really love him
And there's nothing I can do
Don't try to spare my feelings
Just tell me that we're through

And make it easy on yourself
Make it easy on yourself
'Cause breaking up is so very hard to do

And if the way I hold you
Can't compare to his caress
No words of consolation
Will make me miss you less

My darling, if this is goodbye
I just know I'm gonna cry
So run to him
Before you start crying too

And make it easy on yourself
Make it easy on yourself
'Cause breaking up is so very hard to do

Oh, baby, it's so hard to do
