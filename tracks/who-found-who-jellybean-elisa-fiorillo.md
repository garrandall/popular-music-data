How come you can't explain it
The way you're acting recently
It seems that everything is changing
'Cause I can tell the way you're treating me
I believe that you still love me
But you find it hard to show

Don't throw away the chance
'Cause it might be your last
And I won't let you forget

Who
(Who)
Who found who
Does it really matter?
Who
(Who)
Who found who

Look at all the time you've wasted
And how your life is just a mess
I took you home to meet my family
It wasn't meant to be a test
I wanted you to see devotion
And feel that you were being loved

Don't throw away this chance
'Cause it might just be your last
And I won't let you forget

Who
(Who)
Who found who
Does it really matter?
Who
(Who)
Who found who

Hold me, show me
Oh, baby, don't fight it
It's easy, you know
There's nothing I would rather do
Then to give my love to only you

I'm holding out my arms to you
Ooh, baby, don't let me down
So show me that you love me
'Cause it doesn't matter now

Who
(Who)
Who found who
Does it really matter?
Who
(Who)
Who found who

Who, who, who
(Who)
Who found who
Does it really matter?
Who, who
(Who)
Who found who, whoa

So hold me in your arms
And tell me that you're mine
Don't throw away the chance
'Cause it might just be your last

Who
(Who)
Tell me, who found who

Oh, whoa
(Who)
Who found who
Does it really matter?
(Who)
Who found who
