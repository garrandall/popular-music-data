The streets are crowded, people are everywhere.
The sounds of laughter and music fill the air.
Thousands of people walk and sing and talk along the avenue
But it's a lonely town, lonely without you.

I go out dancing with someone new each night
And it means nothing if she lets me hold her tight.
Cause no one's warm embrace or lovely face can thrill me like you do.
But it's a lonely town, lonely without you.

Where can you be? All of our friends keep asking me.
Where have you gone? Without you love I can't go on.
I feel l ike crying each time I hear your name
Cause since you left me this town's just not the same.

So come back home and then we'll live again
The happiness we knew.
Cause it's a lonely town, lonely without you.
Lonely without you.
Lonely without you.
Lonely without you.
Lonely without you...
