Run fast from my day job
Running fast from the way it was
Jump quick to a pay check
Running back to the strip club
I'm never going back, never going back
No you can't make me
Never going back, never going back
They never take me
I've paid enough of petty dues
I've had enough of shitty news
I've had a thing for dirty shoes since I was 10
Love dirty men alike

Ohhhh
Better day than yesterday
Ohhhh
I just take it day by day
Ohhhh
Never hearing what they say
Ohhhhh
I just do it my way

All I got is these broken clocks
I ain't got no time
Just burning daylight
Still up still up
Its still love its
Still love still love still loving still love
Nothing but love for you
Nothing but love
Nothing but love

All that I've got
Pieces and pages
Talking a lot
Sorry I'm faded
Think I forgot
You love me
You love me
You love me

Got a shift at 10 AM
Gotta dip at 10 PM
Gotta get that cash
Won't get past the lunch break
I ain't had a smoke break
In about two days don't break
Been about three years since I dated you
Why you still talking 'bout me like we together?
I moved on for the better
You moved on to whoever
I was down for whatever and then some
You gon' make me late to work again

Ohhhhh
Better day than yesterday
Ohhhh
I just take it day by day
Ohhhh
Never hearing what they say
Ohhhhh
I just do it my way

All I got is these broken clocks
I ain't got no time
Just burning daylight
Still up still up
Its still love its still love
Still love still love still loving still love
Nothing but love for you
Nothing but love
Nothing but love

I don't eat can't sleep past 9 AM
Heartbeat makes me feel young again
Can't beat em just join the party
I don't wanna don't need nobody

All that I've got
Pieces and pages
Talking a lot
Sorry I'm faded
Think I forgot
You love me
You love me
You love me
