Please don't talk to the lifeguard
Please don't talk to the lifeguard
"Please don't talk to the lifeguard"
"Please don't talk to the lifeguard"
Says the sign where I go to swim
Oh-oh-oh-oh

How can I get to know him?
How can I get to show him
That I am so much in love with him?

Dark and handsome, golden tan
Six feet tall, man-oh-man
Gotta make him mine, all mine
Wish they'd take away that sign

Please don't talk to the lifeguard
Please don't talk to the lifeguard
Guess I'll swim way out into the sea
And then I'll meet him when he rescues me

(Please don't talk to the lifeguard)
(Please don't talk to the lifeguard)

Dark and handsome, golden tan
Six feet tall, man-oh-man!
Gotta make him mine, all mine
Wish they'd take away that sign

"Please don't talk to the lifeguard"
"Please don't talk to the lifeguard"
Guess I'll swim way out into the sea
And then I'll meet him when he rescues me

"Please don't talk to the lifeguard"
"Please don't talk to the lifeguard"
Says the sign where I go to swim, oh-oh-oh-oh
(Please don't talk to the lifeguard)
