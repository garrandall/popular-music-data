Been around but I've found
I'd rather be here in your arms

I've been on an ocean liner
To Bombay and Asia Minor
I've seen Calay with
All of it's charms

I've been in the Eiffel Tower
And knew with each passing hour
That I'd rather be here in your arms

I've been to the Riviera
To Switzerland and old Madeira
Waikiki, I thrilled to the palms

I've been to the Cliffs of Dover
And found as I looked them over
That I'd rather be here in your arms

In Italy, I wished
You could hold me tight
Goodbye to Rome, I sailed for home
One sweet Italian night

And now, when I think of China
Bombay and Asia Minor
Compared to you
They're all false alarms

In spite of the fun I've tasted
Just think of the time I've wasted
When I'd rather be here in your arms
Yes, I'd rather be here in your arms
Yes, I'd rather be here in your arms
