Honey, you're sweeter than ice cream and candy
When I'm in need girl, you understand me
You bring me sunshine when the skies are grey
Each time you smile I hear the music play
Girl I'm in love and Ijust want to say

Help Yourself to all of my loving
Help Yourself to all of my loving
Help Yourself to all of my loving
Now that you won my heart
You dance when you walk girl like flame on a fire
You send me up girl higher and higher
I think of your kisses and I lose control
With loving like yours I know I will never grow old
Come on, Sweet baby reach inside my soul yeah
Help Yourself to all of my loving
Help Yourself to all of my loving
Help Yourself to all of my loving
Now, that you won my heart

Help Yourself to all of my loving
Help Yourself to all of my loving
Help Yourself to all of my loving
Now, that you won my heart Help

Help Yourself to all of my loving
Help Yourself to all of my loving
Help Yourself to all of my loving
