This is a story about a hip frog
And we're gonna pick up on it now and
He's on his way out to do some shuckin' and jivin'
You'll be able to tell right away that he's a big mover

Frogg went a-courtin' and he did go, un-huh
Frogg went a-courtin' and he did go, un-huh
Frogg went a-courtin' and he did go
To the Coconut Grove for the midnight show
Un-huh un-huh un-huh

Mollie Mouse was the hat-check girl, woo-woo
(spoken: he knew it all the time)
Mollie Mouse was the hat-check girl, woo-woo
Mollie Mouse was the hat-check girl
He thought he'd give this chick a whirl
Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo

He sauntered up to Mollie Mouse's side, un-huh
(spoken: the direct approach)
He sauntered up to Mollie Mouse's side, un-huh
When he got up to Mollie Mouse's side
He whispered "Mollie will you be my bride?"
Un-huh un-huh un-huh

Not without my Uncle Rat's consent, uh-uh
(spoken: her uncle wrestles on TV)
Not without my Uncle Rat's consent, uh-uh
Not without my Uncle Rat's consent
I wouldn't marry the President
Uh-uh uh-uh uh-uh

Well, she said "That's it, Clyde, better hit the road, farewell"
"That's it, Clyde, better hit the road, goodbye"
"That's it, Clyde, better hit the road"
"You ain't no frog you're a horned toad, farewell, goodbye, adios"
Farewell, goodbye, adios

(spoken: You know, I believe that, uh, any more verses to this song would be anticlimactic; think we ought to end it)
Farewell, goodbye, adios
(spoken: Hey, ain't you gonna let me finish up?)
Farewell, goodbye, adios
(spoken: Aw, shut up, I'm your leader)
(spoken: No, no hands, no hands)

(spoken: Auf Wiedersehen)
Farewell, goodbye, adios
Farewell, goodbye, adios...
