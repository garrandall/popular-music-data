When gentle sways
Into the coming night
A guiding light appears
To lead me home

My days are spent with
Thoughts of loving you
(Gonna reach out)
And wanting you
(Gonna reach out)
What else can I do

Tell me, girl
Reach out your hand
To the one you love
Reach out your hand
To the one you love

And the one you love
Is always at close
To hold you day and night
And be your guiding light

If all your worries
Aeem to get you down
(Reach out, reach out
You gotta reach out)

Don't wear a frown
Don't you worry bout a thing
(Reach out, reach out
You gotta reach out)

When troubles come
I'm there to comfort you
(Gonna reach out)
To take care of you
(If you reach out)
I'll be your everything

Come on, reach out your hand
To the one you love
Reach out your hand
To the one you love

And the one you love
Is always at close
To hold you day and night
And make the darkness bright

Can you tell me why
This one particular guy
Has got a hold on me
To guide my destiny

Reach out your hand
To the one you love
Reach out your hand
To the one you love
Reach out your hand
To the one you love...
