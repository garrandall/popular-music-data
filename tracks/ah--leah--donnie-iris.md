Ah! Leah!

Yeah, it's been a long, long time.
Such a site, you're lookin' better than a body has a right to.
Don't you know we're playin' with the fire?
But we can stop this burnin' desire, Leah!

Ah! Leah! Here we go again!
Ah! Leah! Is it ever gonna end?
Ah! Leah! Here we go again!
Ah! Leah!

I see your lips and I wonder who's been kissin' them.
I never knew how badly I was missin' them.
We both know we're never going to make it,
But when we touch, we never have to fake it, Leah!

Ah! Leah! Here we go again!
Ah! Leah! Is it ever gonna end?
Ah! Leah! Here we go again!
Ah! Leah! We ain't learned our lesson yet!

Baby, it's no good. We're just askin' for trouble.
I can touch you, but I don't know how to love you.
It ain't no use! We'er headed for disaster.
Our minds said, "No!" But our hearts were talkin' faster, Leah!

Ah! Leah! Here we go again!
Ah! Leah! Here we go again!
Ah! Leah! Leah, Leah, Leah!
Ah! Leah! Here we go again!

Ah! Leah, Leah, Leah!
Ah! Leah! We're never, ever, ever gonna make it yeah!
Ah! Leah!
Ah! Leah! Here we go again!
