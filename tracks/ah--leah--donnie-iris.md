Leah
It's been a long, long time
You're such a sight
You're looking better than a body has a right to
Don't you know we're playing with the fire
But we can stop this burning desire
Leah

Ah! Leah!
Here we go again
Ah! Leah!
Is it ever gonna end?
Ah! Leah!
Here we go again
Ah! Leah!

I see your lips
And I wonder who's been kissing them
I never knew how badly I was missing them
We both know we're never going to make it
But when we touch
We never have to fake it
Leah

Ah! Leah!
Here we go again
Ah! Leah!
Is it ever gonna end?
Ah! Leah!
Here we go again
Ah! Leah!
We ain't learned our lesson yet

Baby, it's no good
We're just asking for trouble
I can touch you
But I don't know how to love you

It ain't no use
We're headed for disaster
Our minds said no
But our hearts were talking faster
Leah

Ah! Leah!
Here we go again
Ah! Leah!
Here we go again
Ah! Leah!
Leah, Leah, Leah
Ah! Leah!
Here we go again

Ah! Leah!
Leah
We're never, ever, ever gonna make it, yeah
Ah! Leah!
Here we go again
Ah! Leah!
We're never gonna make it
Ah! Leah!
