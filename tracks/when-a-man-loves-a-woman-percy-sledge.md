When a man loves a woman
He can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd trade the world
For a good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend
If he puts her down

When a man loves a woman
He spend his very last dime
Just trying to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
Sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
Baby, that's the way
It ought to be

Ohh oh

When a man loves a woman
I give you everything, I'm everything I got (yeah)
Just trying to hold on
To your precious love
And baby, baby, please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Deep down in his soul
He known she can bring him such misery
If she is playing him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Cause, I loving eyes, I loving eyes can never see, no

Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
'Cause baby, baby

When a man loves a woman

When a man loves a woman

Ohh oh

When a man loves

When a man really loves

When a man
When a man really loves a woman

Ohh oh

When a man really loves

When a man really, really loves a woman
