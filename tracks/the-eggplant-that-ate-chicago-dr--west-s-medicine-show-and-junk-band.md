You'd better watch out for the eggplant that ate Chicago
For he may eat your city soon
You'd better watch out for the eggplant that ate Chicago
If he gets hungry, the whole damn country's doomed

He came from outer space, lookin' for somethin' to eat
He landed in Chicago, he thought Chicago was a treat
(It was sweet, it was just like sugar)

You'd better watch out for the eggplant that ate Chicago
For he may eat your city soon (wacka-do, wacka-do, wacka-do)
You'd better watch out for the eggplant that ate Chicago
If he gets hungry, the whole damn country's doomed

He came from outer space, lookin' for somethin' to eat
He landed in Chicago, he thought Chicago was a treat
(It was sweet, it was just like sugar)

You'd better watch out for the eggplant that ate Chicago
For he may eat your city soon (wacka-do, wacka-do, wacka-do)
You'd better watch out for the eggplant that ate Chicago
If he gets hungry, the whole damn country's doomed (It's in trouble!)
If he gets hungry, the whole damn country's doomed
