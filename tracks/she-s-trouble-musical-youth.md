I don't wanna move when I'm in her hands
There's nothin' I can do or say
Put everything on hold
Cancel all my plans
Tell everybody I'm away

She may be bad but she feels so good
I'd give her anything she wants
She's trouble I know it
She only needs to touch me
I'm in trouble I love it
I know that when she does it
I'm in trouble I know it

I never know
What's runnin' through her mind
No telling
What she's gonna do
Her every move
Is like a danger sign
Daring me
To come on through

She may be bad but she feels so good
I'd give her anything she wants
She's trouble I know it
She only needs to touch me
I'm in trouble I love it
I know that when she does it
I'm in trouble I know it

She's trouble
She knows what I like
Got a feelin'
I'm fallin', fallin'
Trouble, trouble
There's no hope in sight
I'm in way over my head

She may be bad but she feels so good
I'd give her anything she wants
She's trouble I know it
She only needs to touch me
I'm in trouble I love it
I know that when she does it
I'm in trouble I know it
