Running away to get away
Ha ha ha ha
You're wearing out your shoes

Look at you, fooling you

Making blues of night and day
Hee hee hee hee
You're stretching out your dues

Look at you, fooling you

Shorter cut is quicker but
Ha ha ha ha
Time is here to stay

Look at you, fooling you

The deeper in debt the harder you bet
Hee hee hee hee
Need more room to play

Look at you, fooling you

Another day you're farther away
Ha ha ha ha
A longer trip back home
