Six o'clock in the morning
Still sitting here pouring
The drinks 'til they're gone
We did everything together
Would have done it forever
How did we go wrong?

I know that what goes up
Comes down
I didn't know you'd hit the ground

Why d'you have to give it up?
(Fly high Michelle)
Well you was just a little girl
(Fly high Michelle)
I'll never look into your blue eyes
(Fly high Michelle)
Fly high Michelle

We did it just for a good time
A misunderstood time
We lived with the fear
I wish we still could of done things
And not overhung things
I wish you were here

I know I live a life
Of good things
Until a new life begins

Why d'you have to give it up?
(Fly high Michelle)
Well you was just a little girl
(Fly high Michelle)
I'll never look into your blue eyes
(Fly high Michelle)
Fly high Michelle

I say another prayer
Tonight
That i'll see you in the light

You had to give it up
(Fly high Michelle)
Well you was just a little girl
(Fly high Michelle)
I'll never look into your blue eyes
(Fly high Michelle)
Fly high Michelle

You had to give it up
(Fly high Michelle)
Well you was just a little girl
(Fly high Michelle)
I'll never look into your blue eyes
(Fly high Michelle)
Fly high Michelle

Fly high Michelle

Fly high Michelle

Fly high Michelle
