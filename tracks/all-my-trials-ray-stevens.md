Hush, little baby, don't you cry
You know your mama was born to die
All my trials, Lord, soon be over

The river Jordan is muddy and cold
It chills the body but not the soul
All my trials, Lord, soon be over

Too late, my brothers
Too late but never mind
All my trials, Lord, soon be over

If living were a thing that money could buy
You know the rich would live and the poor would die
All my trials, Lord, soon, they will soon be over

Too late, my brothers
Too late but never mind
All my trials, Lord
They're gonna soon, soon be over
All my trials, Lord
They're gonna soon, they're gonna soon be over
