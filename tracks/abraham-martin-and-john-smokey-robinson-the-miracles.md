Has anybody here seen my old friend Abraham
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed a lotta people, but it seems the good die young
I just looked around and he's gone


Has anybody here seen my old friend Martin
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed a lotta people, but it seems the good die young
I just looked around and he's gone


Has anybody here seen my old friend John
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed a lotta people, but it seems the good die young
I just looked around and he's gone


Didn't you love the things they stood for?
Didn't they try to find some good in you and me?
And we'll be free
Someday soon it's gonna be one day


Has anybody here seen my old friend Bobby
Can you tell me where he's gone?
I thought I saw him walkin' up over the hill
With Abraham and Martin and John
