I call you up when I know he's at home
I jump out of my skin when he picks up the phone
Why can't I tell if he's looking at me?
Should I give him a smile?
Should I get up and leave?


I know it's strange
I don't what I'm thinking
But is it wrong if I see him this weekend?
I really hope I can get him alone
I just don't, don't want her to know


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My best friend's brother is the one for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
A punk rock drummer and he's 6 foot 3
I don't want to, but I want to
'Cause I just can't get him out of my mind and
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My best friend's brother is the one for me
B-F-B! B-F-B!
My best friend's brother, my best friend's brother


I kinda think that I might be his type
'Cause when you're not around
He's not acting too shy
Sometimes I feel like he might make a move
Is this all in my head?
I don't know what to do


I know it's strange
I don't know what he's thinking
But is it wrong if I see him this weekend?
I really hope I can get him alone
I just don't, don't want her to know


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My best friend's brother is the one for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
A punk rock drummer and he's 6 foot 3
I don't want to, but I want to
Cause I just can't get him out of my mind and
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My best friend's brother is the one for me
B-F-B! B-F-B!
My best friend's brother, my best friend's brother
B-F-B! B-F-B!
My best friend's brother, my best friend's brother


'Cause he's such a dream, yeah
And you know what I mean
If you weren't related


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My best friend's brother is the one for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
A punk rock drummer and he's 6 foot 3
I don't want to, but I want to
'Cause I just can't get him out of my mind and
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My best friend's brother is the one for me
B-F-B! B-F-B!
My best friend's brother, my best friend's brother
B-F-B! B-F-B!
My best friend's brother, my best friend's brother
