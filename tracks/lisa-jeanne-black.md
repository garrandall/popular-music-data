Lisa
I've never seen you
And just your name is all I know
And yet I know you have
Torn my world apart

Lisa
I found a letter
That you wrote not long ago
And the secret it revealed
Has broken my heart

You asked him if he told me
Or his love for you
If he'd asked me for his freedom
Like he said he'd do

Lisa
I burned your letter
But on my heart, the words remain
They've ruined my life
And my life is haunted by your name

Lisa
I've heard of women like you
Who go after a man who's not free
You say it's right
But you know it's wrong

And that's why you meet secretly
In the shadows of night
Your arms hold him tight
And your lips whisper passions and lies

Lisa
Is this your way to live just for today?
To break hearts and pretend you don't care

You may win if you cheat
But you'll find love bittersweet
Are you proud of your faithless affair
My heart is broken
And my dreams are dust
And I long to run somewhere and hide
But I made a vow
And I'll keep it now

And, Lisa
He'll never know that I ever knew
There was someone like you
But I'll never let him go

Lisa
I burned your letter
But on my heart, the words remain
They've ruined my life
And my life is haunted by your name

(Lisa, Lisa, Lisa)
