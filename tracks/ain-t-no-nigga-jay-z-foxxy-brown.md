Fox Brown..
Yeah, Jay-Z, what
I keep it fresher than the next, bitch
No need for you to ever sweat the next bitch
With speed, I make the best bitch see the exit, indeed
You gotta know you're thoroughly respected by me
You get the keys to the Lexus with no driver
You got your own '96 somethin' to ride
And keep your ass tight up in Versace, that's why
You gotta watch your friends, you got to watch me, they connivin'
Shit, the first chance to crack the bank, they try me
All they get is 50 cent franks and papayas
From the village to the telly
Time to kill it on your belly no question
Had more black chicks between my sheets than Essence
They say sex is a weapon
So when I shoot, meet your death in less than 8 seconds
Still poundin' in my afterlife
Laughin', my shit is tight, who you askin', right?


Ain't no nigga like the one I got
(No one can fuck you better)
Sleeps around but he gives me a lot
(Keeps you in diamonds and leathers)
Friends'll tell me I should leave you alone
​​​Hah hah, hah hah, hah hah, hah hah​​​
(Tell the freaks to find a man of their own
Man of their own, man of their own)


Yeah, yeah, yeah
Fresh to death in Mo-schi-no, coach bag
Lookin' half black and Filipino, fakin' no jacks
Got you a beeper to feel important
Surroundin' your feet in Joan & David and Charles Jourdan
I keep you dove, but love
You know these hoes be makin' me weak
Y'all knows how it goes, B, and so I creep
I've been sinnin' since you been playin' with Barbie and Ken and
You can't change a player's game in the 9th inning
The chrome rim spinnin' keeps them grinnin'
So I run way the fuck up in 'em
And wrinkle they face like linen
I play hard until they say "God
He's keepin' it real, Jigga stay hard."
Lord, don't even trip, shit, I never slip
Nigga, get a grip, what you don't see is what you get
Weapons concealed, what the fuck y'all feel
When you niggas play sick we can all get ill
Fox Brown.. (what the deal?)


Ain't no nigga like the one I got
(No one can fuck you better)
Sleeps around but he gives me a lot
(Keeps you in diamonds and leathers)
Friends'll tell me I should leave you alone
​​​Hah hah, hah hah, hah hah, hah hah​​​
(Tell the freaks to find a man of their own
Man of their own, man of their own)


Ha, ha, right, right
Yo, ain't no stoppin' this, no lie
Promise to stay monogamous, I try
But, love, you know these hoes be makin' me weak
Y'all know how it goes, B, so I stay deep


What up, boo? Just keep me laced in the illest snakes
Bank rolls and shit, back rubs in the french tubs
Mackin' this bitch, wifey nigga
So when you flip that coke
Remember the days you was dead broke
But now you style and I raised you, basically made you
Into a don, flippin' weight, her-on and shit
You know the pussy is all that
That's why I get baguettes, 5 carats and all that
From Dolce Gabbana to H Bendel, I'm ringin' bells
So who the player? I still keep you in the illest gators
Tailor-made so we can lay up in the shade reminiscin'
On how I fuck the best and shit
Especially when I'm sippin' Baileys
Don't give a fuck about how you move with them other mamis
I push the Z, eatin' shrimp scampi with rocks larger than life
Fuck them Reebok broads, you made it known who your wife was
I got you frontin' in Armani sweaters
Before this rap shit, when you was in leathers and bullshit Berettas
And E classes with Mo in the glasses
Shows in Cali with all the flavor suede Bally's
Now all your mens is up in your Benz's
High post, I swear you be killin' me, playin' inside my pubic hairs
I never worry about them other chicks
'Cause you proved who was your wiz
When you was spendin' that bitch
I took a little when you was up north, your commissary stay pilin'
How you livin' large on the island?
All them collects have me vexed, but when you come home
Knew I was comin' off with half of them checks
Now we on the rise
Your diamond mami with the slanted eyes
Holdin' this grip, cocked the En Glee-Kay and shit
Fucks no, I see half of that dough
Made you into a star, pushin' hundred-thousand-dollar cars


Ain't no nigga like the one I got
(No one can fuck you better)
Sleeps around but he gives me a lot
(Keeps you in diamonds and leathers)
Friends'll tell me I should leave you alone
​​​Hah hah, hah hah, hah hah, hah hah​​​
(Tell the freaks to find a man of their own
Man of their own, man of their own)
