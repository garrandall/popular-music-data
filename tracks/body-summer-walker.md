(We got London on the track)

I've been all in my phone, I got options
And I don't wanna tell you to drop it
But I don't wanna play unfair, yeah

Something that makes me look at you too often
Oh, baby, you can give us something
Baby, I could ride all the time

Baby, I'm talkin' crazy, I
Need you right in my space, for now
Need it, baby, I'm late but I
Still can check in with you
I know that I need my friend, but I
Wouldn't want to leave, you know I
Wouldn't wanna plead
But my heart, my mind and my body sayin' (say, say it)

My mind, my mind and my body
My body is sayin' (say, say it)
My mind, my mind and my heart
My body is sayin'

I don't know what it is
I can't tell you what it is
But you got me goin' crazy
Sex with you is so amazing
Oh, how long can you go, baby?
Better last till my body's sore, is it crazy?

Baby, I'm talkin' crazy, I
Need you right in my space, for now
Need it, baby, I'm late but I
Still can check in with you
I know that I need my friend but I
Wouldn't want to leave, you know I
Wouldn't wanna plead
But my heart, my mind and my body sayin' (say, say it)

My mind, my mind and my body
My body is sayin' (say, say it)
My mind, my mind and my heart
My body is sayin'

I know why
I know why
I know it, we ain't gotta talk, alright
I know you ain't gotta talk, alright
Baby, I just wanna talk to you
(I just wanna talk to you)
