Well, there's no one
Better than you, no, no
In the world there's nothing
Better to do, you see

Than to be with you
And to share with you
My love

Just to sit on a sunny day
And watch the sun
Melt the clouds away

Just you and me
Wishing we could
Stay together always

No one else
In the world could be
Just what you are
What you are to me

And what you are
Is all that I can see
When we're together

No one knows what love is
Better than you do
(No one knows what love is
Better than you do)

No one shows what love is
Better than you do
(No one knows what love is
Better than you do)

Put some love my way
And I promise that
I will stay with you

For there's a page in my diary
An empty page showing
I'll be free to be with you
If you wanna be
We'll be together

Let me be your love
What we do a lot
And if you like
We can say we've got

The kind of love
That can't be forgot
A love forever

For me, there's
No one better than you
There is nothing better to do
Than to share my life with you

For me, there's
No one better than you
There is nothing better to do
Than to share my life with you
