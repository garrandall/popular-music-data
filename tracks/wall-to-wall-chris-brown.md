Great Scott, woo!
Ladies, I'm gon' need you all to back away from the door (Woo!)
We are trying to make way for Chris Brown
Ladies, you are not listening (Woo!)
I need you all to back away from the door
We are trying to make way for Chris Brown
I'm back


Pull up, pull up, can't believe the girls' club packed
What up, what up?  Shawty wanna lead me to the back (To the back)
Ain't been in here 15 minutes, got a pocket full of digits
And she just won't take no
Hold up, hold up, now lil' mama wanna get mad
Slow up, slow up, saying she don't wanna share what she have (She have)
Ain't no particular one that's getting the water gun
So many that I want


They packed up in here wall to wall and (Hey!)
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling (Woah)
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall
They packed up in here wall to wall and (Woah, yeah)
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling (Hey)
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall


Another two just came up and said they love me on the radio (On the radio)
Two twins, that's a cool lil' scenario (Lil' scenario)
They talking leaving right now
Wanna put in some time 'cause you know what they already for
One talking how she like the way that I pop
And the other one (And the other one) said she wanna just watch (Just watch, woo!)
I'm game for any damn thing
But there's more than 200 dames that's ready to go


They packed up in here wall to wall and (Hey!)
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling (Ladies calling)
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall
They packed up in here wall to wall and (Woah, woah, woah)
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling (Hey)
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall
They packed up in here wall to wall and (I can't believe)
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling (There's no many of 'em claiming me)
I'm tryna give one of them all this (Ayy)
But they keep coming from wall to wall (Ayy, ayy, ayy, wall to wall)
They packed up in here wall to wall and (There's so many ladies)
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling (In here)
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall


So many look good in here (So good)
I just don't know which one I want (I want)
If I had to choose y'all know (You know)
I would take all y'all with me
Who wanna try me on the floor? (The floor)
Who ready to come and get this? (Get this)
All I know that I'm feeling this party
And you can see I'm so red-eye


They packed up in here wall to wall and (Ow!)
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling (Ladies calling me)
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall (Woah, woah, woah)
They packed up in here wall to wall and (In here wall to wall)
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling (Oh woah)
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall (Hey, hey)
They packed up in here wall to wall and (I'm tryna give somethin' to shawty now)
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling (Hey)
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall
They packed up in here wall to wall and
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling


Yeah, smash on the radio, bet I penned it (Chris Brown)
Yeah, smash on the radio, bet I penned it (Chris Brown)
Yeah, smash on the radio, bet I penned it (Chris Brown-Brown)
Yeah, smash on the radio, bet I penned it (Chris Brown)
