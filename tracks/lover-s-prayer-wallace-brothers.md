Ooo-OOO-oo
Lover's prayer
Ooo-OOO-oo
Lover's prayer

Heavenly father, up above
Please protect the one that I love
Guide & keep her and let her know
That I'll always love her so
No matter what my love may be
My heart is locked, and she holds the key

Of the girls we need to choose
She's the one that I hate to lose
Oh, she's only gone a while
But half a block seems like a mile
And when she's gone, I'll be so blue
I'll say goodbye my dearest I love you

Ooo-OOO-oo
Lover's prayer
Ooo-OOO-oo
Lover's prayer

Lover's prayer
