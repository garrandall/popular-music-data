Well, you wake up in the mornin', boy
You hear the ding dong ring
Then you look upon the table, boy
You see the same darn thing
You find no food upon the table, boy
There's no pork up in the pan
But you better not complain, boy
You get in trouble with the man

And the Midnite Special
Shine its light on me
Let the Midnite Special
Shine its everlovin' light on me

Well, yonder comes Miss Rosie, boy
How in the world you know
By the way she wears her apron, boy
And the clothes she wore
The umbrella on her shoulder
Piece of paper in her hand
Well, she come to see the gov'nor
She wants to free her man

And the Midnite Special
Shine its light on me
Let the Midnite Special
Shine its everlovin' light on me

Well, if you're ever in Houston, boy
Well, you better do right
You better not gamble, boy
And you better not fight
For the sheriff will grab you
And the boys will pull you down
And the next thing you know, boy
You're prison bound

And the Midnite Special
Shine its light on me
Let the Midnite Special
Shine its everlovin' light on me
