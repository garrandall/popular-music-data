Oh la, la, la, la, la, la

Baby, girl you need a change of mind
Baby, (let me tell you) girl you need a change of mind


Why march in picket lines?
Burn bras and carry signs?
Now, I'm for women's rights
I just want equal nights

Help!

Baby, (yeah) girl you need a change of mind
Baby, girl you need a change of mind


All men don't discriminate (well, what you say?)
This man emancipates
Now I won't chain you up
Just fill your loving cup
Hey, you need me girl

Baby, what you say to that? What you say to that? (Hey baby)
Baby, you need a change of mind, what you say to that?

Baby, girl you need a change of mind
Baby, girl you need a change of mind


Love it is an occupation
A true liberation
You can fight society
Please don't fight loving me

Baby, what you say to that? What you say to that?
Hey baby, you need a change of mind, baby
What you say to that?

Ohla, la, la, la, la, la, la
Ohla, la, la, la, la, la, la

Baby, (Yeah) girl you need a change of mind
Oh baby, girl you need a change of mind

Love it is an occupation
A true liberation
You can fight society
Please don't fight loving me

Hey Hey Hey, you need me girl
Baby, what you say to that? What you say to that?
Hey baby, you need a change of mind
What you say to that?
Hey baby, you need a change of mind
What you say to that?

Bet I can change it
If it takes all night
Let me try to change you
It's all right
I know you need me, I know you need me
Take my hand, I know you need me to be your man
Let me try to change you
I know I can...
