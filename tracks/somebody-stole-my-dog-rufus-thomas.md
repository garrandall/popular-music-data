Somebody stole my dog
Somebody stole my dog
Somebody stole my dog
You know they did

Last night while I lay sleeping
In my house they came a-creeping
Somebody, somebody stole my dog

Somebody stole my dog
I wonder who could've stole my dog
I wonder who could've stole my dog
I wonder why

I told you over and over again
That that dog's my best friend
Somebody, somebody stole my dog
Yes, they did

Somebody stole my dog
Please, you know who could've stole my dog
Somebody please bring my dog back to me
I'd give anything, anything if you just, if you just
If you, if you can, if you just, if you get get get get get get
Get get get get get get get get, bring my dog again

Please, please, please, I love that dog so much
So much, so much, so much
Please, please, please, please, please, please
