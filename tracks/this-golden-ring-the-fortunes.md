This golden ring is gonna buy me a place in my baby's heart
This golden ring is gonna make sure that we never part
It's so funny what a ring can do
Make a girl just like you
Take a ride downtown
Searching for a wedding girl
So I got a ring from my baby
And I think very soon that baby that girl will be mine
Gonna have an angel be mine
Everything's gonna be fine, so fine
This golden ring is all I have to give to you
But give me time my love for make your dreams come true
I've been a... on my money
I've been working hard girl only with you in mind
We got somehing more than money
We gotta a love that's gonna last
It's so funny what a ring can do
Make a girl just like you
Take a ride downtown
Searching for a wedding girl
So I got a ring from my baby
And I think very soon that baby that girl will be mine
Gonna have an angel be mine
Everything's gonna be fine, so fine, fine
