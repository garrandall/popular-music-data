Oh, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm

If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I would've been nice to you
A little more kind to you
I would've looked twice at you
If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I probably would've shared my grub
Depending on how close we was
By now we would be so in love

Girl I'm so surprised to see
The young, fine woman that you grew up to be
Your body's banging like a 400SE
Even your attitude flows pleasantly
I remember when you was just Tonya Hall
A girl that likes to play basketball
As far as I was concern, you were one of my boys
I never cared about my sex or yours but

If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I would've been nice to you
A little more kind to you
I would've looked twice at you
If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I probably would've shared my grub
Depending on how close we was
By now we would be so in love

I'm happy to see
That you're home from school
And I wanna let you know that I'm proud of you
Even when we was younger I admired you
That's why I always used to pick fights with you
I remember when we used to call each other names
Mimic old tv shows and play those childish games
Like I was your Tarzan and you were my Jane
Can we do that nowadays?

If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I would've been nice to you
A little more kind to you
I would've looked twice at you
If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I probably would've shared my grub
Depending on how close we was
By now we would be so in love


If I would've knew the boy next door
Would've been you
I would've been nice to you
Spent a little time with you
I would've dressed cuter too
If I would've knew the boy next door
Would've been you
I would've been on your team
When we played hide and seek
Instead of you chasing me


You're so fly now
(Girl stop playing)
I didn't know you were that guy now
(Naw I ain't)
Phat car, phat life
Impressed I am
Oh maybe we could jam like we used to baby

If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I would've been nice to you
A little more kind to you
I would've looked twice at you
If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I probably would've shared my grub
Depending on how close we was
By now we would be so in love


If I would've knew the boy next door
Would've been you
If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
If I would've knew the boy next door
Would've been you
If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
Oh I would've spent a little more time getting to know you
Baby I would've been more gentle

If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I would've been nice to you
A little more kind to you
I would've looked twice at you
If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I probably would've shared my grub
Depending on how close we was
By now we would be so in love
