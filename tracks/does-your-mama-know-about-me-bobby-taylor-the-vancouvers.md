Does your mama know about me?
Does she know just what I am?
Will she turn her back on me
Or accept me as a man?


And what about your dad?
Did you think of what he'll say?
Will he be understanding
Or does he think the usual way?


Maybe I shouldn't worry
But I've think of this before
And I'd like to get things straight
Before I'm knocking on your door


Does your mama know about me?
Does she notice what I am?
She says forget about me
Do you think you understand?


And what about your friends?
Do you care what people say?
Will you accept the burdens
I know will surely come your way?


Maybe I shouldn't worry
But I've think of this before
And I'd like to get things straight
Before I'm knocking on your door


Does your mama know about me?
Does she know just what I am?
Will she turn her back on me
Or accept me as a man?


Oh, we've got to stand tall
Tumble or crawl
We got to be strong for love, that's so right
Can't be wrong


And every day I see it grow
I don't want to let it go
That's why I gotta know


Does your mama know about me?
Does your mama know about me?
Does your mama know about me?
Does your mama know about me?
Does your mama know about me?
