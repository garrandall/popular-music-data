I know I can't make you stay
And as you're walkin' away
It hurts me so
To see you go
Cause I could have loved you so well.

I know he'll just make you blue
His kind can never be true,
But every day
In every way
I could have loved you so well.

I would have always been strong
Each time I had to be strong
You could rely
On my shoulder to cry on.
Believe me when I say
There wouldn't be a day
When you would ever be lonely.

All my devotion I'd give
For just as long as I live
I'd make you happy
As you could be.
I could have loved you so well.
I could have loved you so well.
If you had only loved me
