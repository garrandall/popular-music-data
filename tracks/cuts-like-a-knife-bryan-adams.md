Drivin' home this evening 
I coulda sworn we had it all worked out 
You had this boy believin' 
Way beyond the shadow of a doubt 

Then I heard it on the street 
I heard you mighta found somebody new 
Well who is he baby - who is he 
And tell me what he means to you 

I took it all for granted 
But how was I to know 
That you'd be letting go 

Now it cuts like a knife 
But it feels so right 
It cuts like a knife 
But it feels so right 

There's times I've 'bin mistaken 
There's times I thought I'd 'bin misunderstood 
So wait a minute darlin' 
Can't you see we did the best we could 

This wouldn't be the first time 
Things have gone astray 
Now you've thrown it all away 

Now it cuts like a knife 
But It feels so right 
It cuts like a knife 
But it feels so right
