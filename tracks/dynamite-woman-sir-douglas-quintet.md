She's a dynamite woman, never gonna let her go
She's a dynamite woman and I love her so
She's a dynamite woman, never gonna let her go
She's a dynamite woman and I love her so

You still can be a hot doll when you're down and out
The way the people look at you, oh, you won't be stout
Met a dynamite woman, wanna make her game my way
She's a dynamite woman, it's all I wanna say

She's a dynamite woman, never gonna let her go
She's a dynamite woman and I love her so
She's a dynamite woman, never gonna let her go
She's a dynamite woman and I love her so

I was just a poor boy when I had to leave
I had so many hard times 'till I had to leave, yeah
Met a dynamite woman, oh, she got me so much soul
She's the dynamite woman, I'll never let her go, no, no

She's a dynamite woman, never gonna let her go
She's a dynamite woman and I love her so
She's a dynamite woman, never gonna let her go
She's a dynamite woman and I love her so
