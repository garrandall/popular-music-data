Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye
Even with our fists held high
It never would've worked out right, yeah
We were never meant for do or die


I didn't want us to burn out
I didn't come here to hurt you, now I can't stop


I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on, so I'm already gone


Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you wanna cry
It started with a perfect kiss then
We could feel the poison set in
"Perfect" couldn't keep this love alive
You know that I love you so, I love you enough to let you go


I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on, so I'm already gone


I'm already gone, already gone
You can't make it feel right when you know that it's wrong
I'm already gone, already gone
There's no moving on, so I'm already gone


Ah, already gone, already gone, already gone (Oh, oh)
Ah, already gone, already gone, already gone, yeah


Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye


I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on, so I'm already gone


I'm already gone, already gone
You can't make it feel right when you know that it's wrong
I'm already gone, already gone
There's no moving on, so I'm already gone
