She's her momma's baby she's her daddy's pride and joy
They've kept her under wraps she ain't been hangin' out
With any ugly I can boy, hardly ever been kissed

Twenty years of innocence, just what I'm lookin' for
I wanna be the man that's holdin' her hand
When she can't hold it back any more

Good little girls make some mighty wild women
Been savin' it up since the very beginnin'
When they fall in love they wanna take it to the limit
Good little girls make some mighty wild women

Well she's never been to Vegas or danced in a Honky Tonk
No trail of broken hearts although she looks the part
That ain't the kind of life she wants, she's waitin' for a gold ring

Before she tries her wings, that's what I'm waitin' for
I wanna be the man that's holdin' her hand
When she can't hold it back any more

Good little girls make some mighty wild women
Been savin' it up since the very beginnin'
When they fall in love they wanna take it to the limit
Good little girls make some mighty wild women
