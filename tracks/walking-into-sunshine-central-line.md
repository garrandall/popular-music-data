Too much rainy days, rainy days
Found so much lazy ways, lazy ways
I've got to get away, ohbaby
This kind of life is not for me

I'm working day and night, night and day
Working for my babe, only way
It's all over me, I can't stand it
This kind of life is not for me

I need a holiday to get away from the rush
I got to get away from the rush
Off the week if gold is cheap
I hop and fly away where the sun always shines
Eight days a week

'Cause there'll be sunshine
Yes, I'll be walking into sunshine (Sunshine)
Give me the sun (Sunshine)
So all my rainy days will all be gone

I don't want a fuss, want a fight
I'm checkin' in to book my early flight
I've got to get away to see what's right for me

Walking by the sea (Go walking by the sea)
That's when I'll be free (Don't want to hurry me)
I can do as I please when my mind is at ease
And I won't be worried at all

I need a holiday to get away from the rush
I got to get away from the rush
Off the week if gold is cheap
I hop and fly away where the sun always shines
Eight days a week

'Cause there'll be sunshine
Yes, I'll be walking into sunshine (Sunshine)
Give me the sun
Sunshine
Sunshine

Sunshine
Sunshine
Sunshine
Sunshine

I got to get away, I got to do it now
I got to walk into the sun, haha
I got to get away, I got to do it now
I got to walk into the sun, haha

I got to get away, I got to do it now
I got to walk into the sun, haha
I got to get away, I got to do it now
I got to walk into the sun, haha

I got to get away, I got to do it now
I got to walk into the sun, haha
I got to get away, I got to do it now
I got to walk into the sun, haha

I got to get away, I got to do it now
I got to walk into the sun, haha
I got to get away, I got to do it now
I got to walk into the sun, haha

I got to get away (Sunshine), I got to do it now
I got to walk into the sun, haha
I got to get away (Sunshine), I got to do it now
I got to walk into the sun, haha

I got to get away (Sunshine), I got to do it now
I got to walk into the sun, haha
I got to get away (Sunshine), I got to do it now
I got to walk into the sun

And I'll be walking into sunshine
(I got to walk into the sun, haha)
I'll be walking into sunshine
(I got to walk into the sun, haha)

I'll be there
(I got to walk into the sun, haha)
Too much rainy days
(I got to walk into the sun, haha)

I don't want a fuss
(I got to walk into the sun, haha)
I got to get away, get away, get away

I got to get away, I got to do it now
I got to walk into the sun, haha
I got to get away, I got to do it now
I got to walk into the sun, haha

I got to get away, I got to do it now
I got to walk into the sun, haha
I got to get away, I got to do it now
I got to walk into the sun, haha

I got to get away, I got to do it now
I got to walk into the sun, haha
I got to get away, I got to do it now
I got to walk into the sun, haha

I got to get away, I got to do it now
I got to walk into the sun, haha
I got to get away, I got to do it now
I got to walk into the sun, haha
