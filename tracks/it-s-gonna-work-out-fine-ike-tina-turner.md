Darling (yes, Tina) it's time to get next to me
(Honey, that was my plan from the very beginning)
Darling (uh-huh) I never thought that this could be
(What you mean) oh yeah

Your lips set my soul on fire
You could be my one desire
Oh darling (yes, yes) I think it's gonna work out fine
(It's gonna work out fine)
I wanna tell you something, Ike

Ike (uh-huh) I went to see the preacher man
(A preacher man, you must be losing your mind)
I started (started what?) started making wedding plans
(Oh really?) oh yeah

If your love is half as true
As the love I offer you
Oh darling (yes, yes) I think it's gonna work out fine
(It's gonna work out fine)

I keep a telling ya (I think it's gonna work out fine)
I can feel it's gonna (feel it's gonna work out)
I keep on telling you (I know it's gonna work out fine)
Ah, I'm so glad that you're mine, all mine

Remember (remember what?) I used to call you Dapper Dan
(Yes, those were the good ole days)
But Thriller (but Killer, honey) forever a loving man (that's me) oh yeah

A whole lot of love used to be your speed
But now, pretty daddy, I'm all you need
Oh darling (yes, yes) I know it's gonna work out fine
(It's gonna work out fine)

I keep a telling ya (I think it's gonna work out fine)
I can feel it's gonna (feel it's gonna work out)
I keep on telling you (I know it's gonna work out fine)
I know it's gonna (know it's gonna work out fine)
I want you to know it's gonna work out (know it's gonna work out)
Yeah, yeah, it's gotta work out (know it's gonna work out fine)
I want to tell you it will work (know it's gonna work out fine)
I got to tell you it will work (know it's gonna work out)
Got to work and work and work (know it's gonna work out fine)
I know, I know it's gonna work out (know it's gonna work out)
Oh, it's gonna work (know it's gonna work out fine)
