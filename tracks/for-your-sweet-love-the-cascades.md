Take a piece of chalk
And draw a line
Around the world
About a hundred times

And that's how far I'd go
For your sweet love

Oh, oh, oh, now
Count all the rain
In a million years
And make believe
It's a million tears

Yes, and that's
How much I'd cry
For your sweet love

Here's everything
That you're worth to me
In one simple line
I'd go to the ends of the Earth
To be near you all the time

If I owned the world
With it's mountains high
The sun, the moon
And the stars in the sky

Oh, well
That's how much I'd give
For your sweet love

Here's everything
That you're worth to me
In one simple line
I'd go to the ends of the Earth
To be near you all the time

If I owned the world
With it's mountains high
The sun, the moon
And the stars in the sky

Oh, well
That's how much I'd give
For your sweet love

For your sweet love
For your sweet love
