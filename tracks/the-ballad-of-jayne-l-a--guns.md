She was always something special
A diamond shining bright in the rain
Everybody dreams of angels
No one will ever know
How much I loved you so

Now it all seems funny
Kinda like a dream
Things ain't always what they seem
What a shame
What happened to Jayne

You were always on my mind
Childlike summer days in the sun
Slowly wishes turn to sadness
Time don't heal a broken gun
I wish I'd never let you go
Hear me now 'cause I want you to know

That it all seems funny
Kinda like a dream
Things ain't always what they seem
What a shame
What happened to Jayne

Now she's breakin' hearts in heaven
Shining bright in the sky
I still hear her voice in the wind
I still think of you in the night, oh yeah
Well, I guess she'll never know
How much I need her so

Now it all seems funny
Kinda like a dream
Things ain't always what they seem
What a shame
What a shame
What happened to Jayne

Now it all seems funny
Kinda like a dream
Things ain't always what they seem
What a shame
What happened to Jayne
What happened to Jayne
