I’mma Imma put it on her yeah Day26, Joc
I’mma Imma put it on her yeah They call me Diddy
Let's go


Doin my two step off of club pure
The Girl walks by rockin christian dior
We mix it up like juicy lacore
I put it on her, time to rock some juicy couture
Fuck the backseat lets do it in the PJ
Yeah I know that sounds so cliche
She outta breathe cause we been cuttin like a DJ
She’s on top of me, beneath me is the freeway


Honey walked up in the club
Dress lookin’ like it’s painted on
I can tell that she ain’t got any panties on
Well, baby that’s the way that I like it, yeah
And I know she’s from the hood
The way she drop it so hard
Booty bumpin’ like the sounds in my car
She should
Let me take it up a notch
Get her off the block
Take her to my spot and it’s on


I’mma put it on her
I’mma I’mma put it on her
I’mma I’mma put it on her
I’mma I’mma put it on her
I’mma put it on her
I’mma I’mma put it on her
I’mma I’mma put it on her
I’mma I’mma put it on her


I hope she’s ready
Cause she about to get it
And now she move her body
So I’m about to hit it
Now put it on her (put it on her)
Now put it on her (put it on her)
Now put it on her (put it on her)


She got me in a daze
Thinking bout the ways I’mma get her tonight
I’mma put her on my stage
Let her do her thang
Let her play on the mic
She got that swagger
The way she move it like a pro
Love the way she drop and get low (Get low)
That’s why I let her
Cause I gotta get her home
Show her how I do when I put it on


I’mma put it on her
I’mma I’mma put it on her
I’mma I’mma put it on her
I’mma I’mma put it on her
I’mma put it on her
I’mma I’mma put it on her
I’mma I’mma put it on her
I’mma I’mma put it on her


I hope she’s ready
Cause she about to get it
And now she move her body
So I’m about to hit it
Now put it on her (put it on her)
Now put it on her (put it on her)
Now put it on her (put it on her)


Baby tell me if you ready to go home with me tonight
I got the bed ready girl I'm gonna set you free tonight, tonight

I’mma I’mma put it on her Let me get some of this
I’mma I’mma put it on her It’s Diddy, let’s go


Just say the word I’ma put it on ya
You can say you touched the president, Cerock Obama
I’m a bad boy and that’s what bad boys do
Black ice, black coop, black cars too
Don’t tattoo my name, tattoo my logo
Let the whole world know you’re fuckin with a mogul
You don’t need a closet
Take you to Taiwan
You can have the whole warehouse, ladies Sean John
And on the 14th I’ll buy the whole island
Name it after Champagne and call it Chris Stylin (Cerock)
I knew that’d have you smilin
Like Day26 I’ll have your ring finger shinin


I’mma put it on her
I’mma I’mma put it on her
I’mma I’mma put it on her
I’mma I’mma put it on her
I’mma put it on her
I’mma I’mma put it on her
I’mma I’mma put it on her
I’mma I’mma put it on her


I hope she’s ready
Cause she about to get it
And now she move her body
So I’m about to hit it
Now put it on her (put it on her)
Now put it on her (put it on her)
Now put it on her (put it on her)


Baby tell me if your ready to go home with me
Tonight, tonight
You know she comes with us
