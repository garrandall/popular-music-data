On the bank of the river stood Running Bear, young Indian brave
On the other side of the river stood his lovely Indian maid
Little White Dove was her name, such a lovely sight to see
But their tribes fought with each other, so their love could never be


Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love that couldn't die
He couldn't swim the raging river 'cause the river was too wide
He couldn't reach the Little White Dove waiting on the other side
In the moonlight he could see her throwing kisses 'cross the waves
Her little heart was beating faster waiting for her Indian brave




Running Bear dove in the water, Little White Dove did the same
And they swam out to each other through the swirling stream they came
As their hands touched and their lips met, the raging river pulled them down
Now they'll always be together in their happy hunting ground
