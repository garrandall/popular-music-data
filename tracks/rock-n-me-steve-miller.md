Well, I've been lookin' real hard
And I'm tryin' to find a job
But it just keeps gettin' tougher every day
But I got to do my part, cause I know in my heart
I got to please my sweet baby, yeah


Well, I ain't superstitious
And I don't get suspicious
But my woman is a friend of mine
And I know that it's true that all the things that I do
Will come back to me in my sweet time


So keep on rock'n me, baby
Keep on-a rock'n me, baby
Keep on-a rock'n me, baby
Keep on-a rock'n me, baby


I went from Phoenix, Arizona
All the way to Tacoma
Philadelphia, Atlanta, L.A
Northern California, where the girls are warm
So I could be with my sweet baby, yeah


Keep on-a rock'n me, baby
Keep on-a rock'n me, baby
Keep on-a rock'n me, baby
Keep on-a rock'n me, baby
Baby, baby, baby


Keep on rock'n
Rock'n me, baby
Keep on-a rock'n
Rock'n me, baby
Ooh yeah


Don't get suspicious
Now, don't be suspicious
Babe, you know you are a friend of mine
And you know that it's true
That all the things that I do
Are gonna come back to you in your sweet time


I went from Phoenix, Arizona
All the way to Tacoma
Philadelphia, Atlanta, L.A
Northern California, where the girls are warm
So I could hear my sweet baby say


Keep on-a rock'n me, baby
Keep on-a rock'n me, baby
Keep on-a rock'n me, baby
Keep on-a rock'n me
Rock'n me, rock'n
Baby, baby, baby


Keep on rock'n me, baby
Keep on-a rock'n me, baby
Keep on-a rock'n me, baby
Keep on-a rock'n me, baby
