Oh, when I hear your name
I start to shake inside, yes I do
When I see you stroll
I lose my self-control

But that's what love will do for you
That's what love will make you do, oh yeah
No matter how hard I fight it
Oh, I'm still in love with you

Listen, if you're ever in need
There's no limit to what I'll do
I'll work eight days a week
And give it all to you

'Cause that's what love will do for you
That's what love will make you do
No matter how hard I fight it
Oh, I'm still in love with you

Oh, that's right, alright

Listen, when they speak of beauty
You can stand the test, yes you can
When they talk about makin' love
Baby, you're the best, but yes you are

I don't want to brag about you too much
And give others ideas
But I'm tryin' hard to express myself
'Cause baby, that's the way I feel

That's what love will do for you
That's what love will make you do, oh yeah
No matter how hard I fight it
Baby, I'm still in love with you, yeah

Oh yeah, come on, yeah, hm
