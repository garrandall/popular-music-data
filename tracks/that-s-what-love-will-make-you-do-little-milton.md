Mama was hurtin'
And we just made shit worst, what a bruise
In middle school I took money out of her purse
I'm in Class just trying to impress some woman
I thought I grabbed they five, it turns out I took a hundred
Stupid me, and I know how hard she works
She had to beg and borrow just so I could wear this shirt
And I just stole her nail money or even worse her Bill money
I lied until I looked into her eyes and I saw tears running down (Damn...)
Silly me, almost 20 years later we still making mama cry, only now I got more paper
Well my Dough ain't so Legit
Filled her dryer with my bricks
I know once I had my Son I was supposed to quit, shit (Shhhit...)
I'm still trying to get that work off
And then life thew a nigga a curve ball
And then I wrote "Letter To My Son"
Does it really matter if I feed my child with dirty funds?
I'm just getting it how I live
I'm just trying to make something out of nuthin'
And everything's A-ok until mama decides to do her Laundry
I got an appetite, who wants beef?
I'll slaughter you on Front Street
I will not turn the other cheek
I do not agree with Dr. King, but R.I.P to Doctor King
And I am almost certain that this was not his Dream...
But fuck it, I got money, bitches love me
And if I give these hoes my All, then they will all leave me with nothing so I'm leaning

Leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning
What am I doinggg?
Leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning
What am I doinggg?
Leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning
What am I doinggg?
Leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning
What am I doinggg?
Leaning

Your girl Friend is on my penis because I made a dollar out a Dime
Damn it, I'm a genius
We all on the road to riches
See me, I chose the scenic
Baby I survived the jungle if you can name it, I done seen it
Chasing all these dead pres'
I got Friends that I don't know
But when my Doe start running low they all turn Casper the Friendly Ghost (Gone.)
A rivederci, Adios
Like balloon in a parade, I'm just trying to stay afloat
Therefore, I'm leaning

Leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning
What am I doinggg?
Leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning
What am I doinggg?
Leaning, leaning

And I'm not on promethazine
But my flow so methamphetamine
Didn't stop me, well let 'em Dream
Bring the fat bitch, go ahead, let her sing
And I'll pop up like a Gopher and then load up and kill everything
Fuck you and fuck them niggas with you

I'm at'cho door like Jehova witness
You a pussy nigga, I know the difference

I lay that barrel right on your whiskers
Those shots loud, my ears whistle
HD you get a clearer picture
Got more bullets than a deck of cards
I'll shuffle up then come deal with you
I'm popular but I'm still with it
I'm bawling like Kidd-Gilchrist
And we ain't talking about luncheon cards when we say we after that meal ticket
Rest in peace to Mill Tickett 
And little Milton, in loving memory
Know I ain't one of those rapper niggas
I'm satisfied with my own identity, Leaning

Leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning
What am I doinggg?
Leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning
What am I doinggg?
Leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning
What am I doinggg?
Leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning, leaning
What am I doinggg?
Leaning
