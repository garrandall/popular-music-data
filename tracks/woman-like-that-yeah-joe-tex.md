Man give a woman plenty of lovin'
Woman like that, yeah
Man give a woman plenty of lovin'
Woman like that, yeah

And when man seen woman cry
Man go to her and dry her eye
Man show a woman that he cares
And the woman gonna be right there, yeah

But a man keep a woman long
Man looks around and woman be gone
Woah oh oh, man be all alone, oh yeah

Man tell a woman she look fine, oh shucks
Woman like that, yeah
Man take woman out sometime, huh
Woman like that, yeah

Then when man has to go away
Man woman won't go astray
Man can leave with a satisfied mind
That his woman gonna toe the line-ine-ine

But if man don't take woman out
He's gonna have a lot to worry about
Woah oh oh, some other man will take her out
Yes he will, huh

Oh-oh

Man kiss woman sweet and slow
Woman like that, yeah
Man that makes woman love grow
Woman like that, yeah

And if you love her let her know
You'd be surprised how far that goes
Man make a woman feel secure
Woman will stick by him for sure, yeah

But man act like he don't care
It's for sure he won't get no where
Woah oh oh, woman will leave him sittin' right there
Ha ha, oh yes she will

Woman like that, yeah
Put your arms around her and hold her
Oh shucks, woman like that, yeah
Tell her she look fine, oh yeah
