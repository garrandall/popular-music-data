It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
It's not the way you kissed that tears me apart

Many, many, many nights go by
I sit alone at home and cry over you
What can I do?
Don't want nobody, nobody
Cause, baby, it's you
Baby, it's you

Is it true what they say about you?
They say you'll never, ever, never be true
It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do?
What 'bout you?
Don't want nobody, nobody
Baby, it's you
Baby, it's you

Baby

It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love any old way
What can I do?
What 'bout you?
Don't want nobody, nobody
Baby, it's you
Baby, it's you

Don't leave me alone
Come on home
Baby, it's you
Baby, it's you
You know I need your lovin'
You know I love you
Baby, it's you
