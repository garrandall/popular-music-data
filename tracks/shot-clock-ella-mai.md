Twenty four seconds. yeah. you better not stop
You got twenty four seconds. can you beat the shot clock?
What you're waitin' on, little daddy. I ain't got that much time
You seem anxious, you seem adamant, but you ain't press my line

Wondering why, why, why (oh, why)
Know you see ain't shy, shy, shy (oh, why)
I'm 'a say bye, bye, bye, but I know I won't think twice (yeah)
Better let go of your pride (do-do)
Do it now (do-do), just do it now (do-do), oh, yeah

When a nigga pull up on me, tell that nigga back, back
Don't you know all of these niggas wish that they could bag that?
I'm just saying, boy, you're playing, you're gon' let it wind down
You got twenty four seconds, and it's starting right now

Shot clock
Like, don't sleep, don't sleep
You're gon' miss your opportunity
Shot clock
Like, don't sleep, don't sleep, nigga
Pick up your feet, nigga
Shot clock
Like, don't sleep, don't sleep (do-do)
You're gon' miss your opportunity (do-do)
Shot clock
(like, don't sleep, don't sleep, nigga
Pick up your feet, my nigga

Five years of dating
Tired of being patient
What the fuck you're waiting for?
Yeah

It's a lot of niggas hating
And I don't entertain 'em
But damn, you gotta give me more

Shh, I know, I know and I'm really trying
Oh-oh, if you don't want it like me
I could think of about a hundred things I could be doing right now
Than wasting my time with you, oh (do-do)
OK, OK,
Since you gotta have it your way (do-do)
I'm 'a start that clock on you (do-do)
We gon' see what's up

When a nigga pull up on me, tell that nigga back, back
Don't you know all of these niggas wish that they could bag that (bag that)?
I'm just saying, boy, you're playing, you're gon' let it wind down (wind down)
You got twenty four seconds, and it's starting right now (right now)

Shot clock
Like, don't sleep, don't sleep
You're gon' miss your opportunity
Shot clock
Like, don't sleep, don't sleep, nigga
Pick up your feet, nigga

Shot clock
Like, don't sleep, don't sleep (do-do)
You're gon' miss your opportunity (do-do)
Shot clock
Like, don't sleep, don't sleep, nigga
Pick up your feet, my nigga
Shot clock

Like, don't sleep, don't sleep (do-do)
You're gon' miss your opportunity (do-do)
Like, don't sleep, don't sleep, nigga
Pick up your feet, my nigga

Like, don't sleep, don't sleep (do-do)
You're gon' miss your opportunity (do-do)
Like, don't sleep, don't sleep, nigga
Pick up your feet, my nigga

Twenty four seconds
You got twenty four seconds
You gon' miss your opportunity
Shot clock

"L", "love"
Add "-rs", and that's surely what we are
Flip it 'round, add "-ve", and let's see if this goes far
Full of chuckles and cuddles and sometimes eye puddles
Compose love like we're Mozart
