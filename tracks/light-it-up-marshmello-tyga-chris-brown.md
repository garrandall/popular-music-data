You a real bitch, light it up (Light it up)
You a real bitch, go 'n light it up (Light it up)
It's your birthday, go 'n light it up (Light it up)
I'm drunk and I'm throwin' middle fingers up
(Mello made it right)

Pass me the kush, we gon' light it up (Light it up)
I'm drunk and I'm throwin' middle fingers up (Fingers up)
Slide in my DM, you can hit me up (Hit me up)
She wanna be the one, she ain't the only one (No)
I got a bop in the trap, got a bop on my lap (Yeah)
Bitch, I'm a dog but I ain't got to chase the cat (Nah)
They pull up where I'm at, get the addy for their friends (Yeah)
I don't keep loose change and I don't top loose ends
If a nigga want beef, if a bitch want beef
We put it on the grill, serve that bitch to the street (Blah)
She call me Young Beckham, 'cause a nigga go deep (Yeah)
I live by the beat, I'ma kill what I eat (Ayy)

If you a real bitch, light it up (Light it up)
If you a real bitch, go 'n light it up (Light it up, light it up)
It's your birthday, go 'n light it up (Light it up, ayy)
I'm drunk and I'm throwin' middle fingers up (Fingers up, fingers)
Ooh, my niggas gon' light it up (Light it up, light it up)
If you a real nigga, go 'n light it up (Light it up)
It's your birthday, light it up (Light it up)
It's you a real bitch, go 'n light it up (Light it up)

She can get it running over me (Yeah)
She heard about me and she know I'm a freak (Ooh)
She can top, running over me (Over me, yeah)
Girl, you know ain't no controllin' me (No, no)
Close your mouth when I'm facing you (Yeah)
I don't chase (When I drink in it, straight up)
Tell your girl she can play with it (Ooh)
Light it up so we stay lit
We gon' keep it going like (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I know you see the smoke in the air, yeah, yeah
(You see that smoke, you see)
You might get up, Mami
Don't tell nobody
Don't mean to push up on you
Whiskey keeping you balanced
Throw that ass backward while that ass clapping
Ooh woah, light it up

If you a real bitch, light it up (Light it up)
If you a real bitch, go 'n light it up (Light it up, light it up)
It's your birthday, go 'n light it up (Light it up, ayy)
I'm drunk and I'm throwin' middle fingers up (Fingers up, fingers)
Ooh, my niggas gon' light it up (Light it up, light it up)
If you a real nigga, go 'n light it up (Light it up)
It's your birthday, light it up (Light it up)
It's you a real bitch, go 'n light it up (Light it up)

Yeah, Mello (You a real bitch, light it up)
T-raw, C-Breezy
If you a real bitch, go 'n light it up
You a real bitch, light it up
If you a real bitch, go 'n light it up
