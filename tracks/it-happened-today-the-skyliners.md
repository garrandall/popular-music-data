I knew someday you'd come my way
It happened, it happened today
I knew somehow that you would smile
It happened, it happened today


I told everybody that I'd win your heart
They said that we would fall apart
Today you said you'd just love me
Now I'm as happy as I can be
I knew someday you'd come my way
It happened, it happened today



I knew someday that I'd hear you say
You'd love me come what may
And it happened, it happened today
