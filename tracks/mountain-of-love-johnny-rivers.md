Standing on a mountain looking down on a city
The way I feel is a doggone pity
Teardrops fallin' down a mountainside
Many times I've been here, many times I've cried
We used to be so happy when we were in love
High on a mountain of love

Night after night I'm a-standing here alone
Weepin' my heart out till cold gray dawn
Prayin' that you're lonely and you'll come here too
Hoping just by chance that to get a glimpse of you
Tryin' hard to find you, somewhere my love
High on a mountain of love

Mountain of love, mountain of love
You should be ashamed
We used to be a mountain of love
But you just changed your name

Way down below there's a half a million people
Somewhere there's a church with a big tall steeple
Inside the church is an altar filled with flowers
Wedding bells are ringin', they shoulda been ours
That's why I'm so lonely, high up above
High on a mountain of love

Hey!

That's why I'm so lonely, high up above
High on a mountain of love

Mountain of love, mountain of love
You should be ashamed
You used to be a mountain of love
But you just changed your name

Way down below there's a half a million people
Somewhere there's a church with a big tall steeple
Inside the church is an altar filled with flowers
Wedding bells are ringin' that shoulda been ours
That's why I'm so lonely, high up above
High on a mountain of love
High on a mountain of love
High on a mountain of love
