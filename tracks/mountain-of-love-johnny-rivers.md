Standing on the mountain looking down on the city
The way I feel is a doggone pity
Teardrops falling down a mountainside
Many times I've been here
Many times I've cried
We used to be so happy
When we were in love
High on a mountain of love

Night after night I've been standing here alone
Weeping my heart out to cold gray dawn
Praying that you're lonely and you'll come here too
Hoping just by chance that I get a glimpse of you
Trying hard to find you
Somewhere I love
High on a mountain of love

A mountain of love
A mountain of love
You should be ashamed
We used to be a mountain of love
But you just changed your name

Way down below there's a half a million people
Somewhere there's a church with a big tall steeple
Inside a church there's an altar filled with flowers
Wedding bells are ringing and they should have been ours
That's why I'm so lonely
My dreams gone above
High on a mountain of love

(Musical interlude)

A mountain of love
A mountain of love
You should be ashamed
We used to be a mountain of love
But you just changed your name

Way down below there's a half a million people
Somewhere there's a church with a big tall steeple
Inside a church there's an altar filled with flowers
Wedding bells are ringing that should have been ours
That's why I'm so lonely
My dreams gone above
High on a mountain of love

High on a mountain of love
High on a mountain of love
High on a mountain of love (fade)
