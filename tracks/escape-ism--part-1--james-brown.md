Fellows, can I get into it?
Can I get into it?
Can I pull a sheet off 'em
Can I get into it
Can I tell 'em about escape-ism

Ain't it good to you?
Ain't it good to you?
Ain't it good to you?
Ain't it good to you?

Said Byrd I wanna get down
Byrd I need to get down
Can I get down?
Can I get down?
Can I get down?
Can I get down?
Oh can I get down?
Get

Ain't it good to you?
Ain't it good to you?
Ain't it good to you?
Ain't it good to you?
Ain't it good to you?
Bad brother, rap down a little bit right here
Man, you know, we better take it on the LAM
You better watch the man
Say it again brother, say it again, say it again
"I said we better take it on the LAM"
Say it again
"I said we better take it on the LAM"
You better watch the man

You got your eyes on the Fred
Fred Wesley, give him a big round of applause, Fred Wesley
Bobby Byrd, brother Bobby Byrd
Bobby Byrd, ladies and gentleman
Byrd, you think we're talkin' too loud
Make that fuss

I ain't got no dust
Bobby Byrd, I said Byrd
Yeah
Can I gey down on the organ
Come on down
Can I get down
Come on over and get down
All the way
All the way
I see you're tryin' to please 

Can I get down

You're gonna let me get down

You're gonna let me get down

You're gonna let me get down
You're gonna let me get down
Get on down
You're gonna let me get down
Get on down
