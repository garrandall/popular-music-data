Johnny's firing' up his coleman grill
We've got 24 tall boys on the chill
Yeah, 14 of 'em's mine
A little Marshall Tucker on the radio (can't you see)
You know we're just catching a little groove before the show
Yeah, ain't playin' nothin' slow.

At the parking lot party
Tailgate buzz just sipping' on suds
Ain't never too early
To light one up, fill up your cup
Cause there ain't no party like the pre-party
And after the party the after-party
At the parking lot party

Well, the opening band is doin' sound-check
Man, they sound pretty good, heh
Hell, I ain't even bought no tickets yet
Yeah, but that's alright, we don't care
'cause all the pretty girls are sitting right here
Kicking back in a lawn chair

At the parking lot party
Tailgate buzz just sipping on suds
Ain't never too early
To light one up, fill up your cup
Cause there ain't no party like the pre-party
And after the party the after-party
At the parking lot party
(yeah, pass me the chicken wings now)

Whoa-oh-oh-oh!
Old Tom's pulling' his guitar out
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!
It's bout time to pass that shine around
Hey-hey-hey!
Show's about to start but we ain't about to leave
Hey-hey-hey!
It's one hell of a time and it's all for free!

At the parking lot party
Tailgate buzz just sipping on suds
Ain't never too early
To light one up, fill up your cup
Cause there ain't no party like the pre-party
And after the party the after-party
At the parking lot party

Oh yeah, now, c'mon

Parkin' lot party
Oh, they're gonna have to tow my ass out of here
Parking lot party
Oh, man, damn, girl
Parking lot party
Woo-ooh
Parking lot party
Don't think I've ever seen that before, lord
(hey-hey-hey)


At the parking lot party
Tailgate buzz just sipping on suds
Ain't never too early.
To light one up, fill up your cup
Cause there ain't no party like the pre-party
And after the party the after-party
At the parking lot party
