Girl I really did mean it when I wished you the best
Good to hear you're killing it way out west
Finding your own way didn't take too long
Baby rock on, rock on

It's getting tough keeping up with where you are
Posting pics like some big Hollywood star
Guess every club in town is playing your song
Baby rock on, rock on

Rock on like you don't miss me
Rock on like it's all good
Rock on 'til you forget me, just like you said you would
I gotta tell you I can't stand
The thought of someone else holding that hand
I should've put a rock on

Yeah, I do a lotta thinking about wanting you back
But I don't know about all dolled up like that
If my homegrown country girl's long gone
Then baby rock on, rock on

Rock on like you don't miss me
Rock on like it's all good
Rock on 'til you forget me, just like you said you would
I gotta tell you I can't stand
The thought of someone else holding that hand
I should've put a rock on

Yeah, rock on

I saw your hashtag, digging on some new dude
Girl, you left me with nothing else to do

Rock on like I don't miss you
Rock on like it's all good
Rock on 'til I forget you, just like I wish I would
I gotta tell you I can't stand
The thought of someone else holding that hand
I should've put a rock on

Baby rock on
Yeah, I should've put a rock on
Yeah, baby rock on
Yeah, I really did mean it when I wished you the best
