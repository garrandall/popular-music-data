Three cheers for the girls
Hip, hip! (Hoorah)
Hip, hip! (Hoorah)
Hip, hip!


Sleepy head, kid sister
Lying on the floor
18 years and younger, boy
Well, she knows what she's waiting for

Yuki's a cool school mistress
She's an Oriental princess
She shows films in the classroom, boy
They put the paper on the windows


Ah, what can the sisters do?
Ah, girls' school


Head nurse is Sister Scala
Now she's a Spanish doll
She runs a full body out call massage parlour
From the teacher's hail


Ah, what can the sisters do?
Ah, girls' school


Well now, Roxanne's the woman trainer
She puts the kids to bed (bed)
She gives them pills in a paper cup
And she knocks them on the head


Ah, what can the sisters do?
Ah, girls' school
Ah, what can the sisters do?
Ah, girls' school


She shows films in the classroom, boy
The put the paper on the windows
Ah, what can the sisters do?
Ah, girls' school
