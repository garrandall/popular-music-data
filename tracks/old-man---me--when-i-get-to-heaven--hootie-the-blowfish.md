Well an old man said to me 
In a voice filled with pain 
Where you going young man 
Said I'm going to fight a war 
Gonna fight for my country 
In some foreign land 
He said "The sun will never hurt you 
Never harmed anyone 
But you must realize" 
If you try to stare her down 
She will win in the end 
She will burn your eyes 
She will burn them 

Seen a million places 
Seen a million faces die 
And I wonder who will walk with me 
When I get to Heaven 

He said "Boy I was young once 
Yeah I was tough 
Sailing on Uncle Sam's boat 
Hey I could kill the enemy 
I could die on foreign streets 
But I could not vote 
But now you walk by me 
You won't talk to me 
Say this is my fate 
But every time you walk the streets boy 
Most of them you meet 
You see it's you they hate 
It's you... 

Seen a million faces 
Seen a million places die 
And I wonder who will walk with me 
When I get to Heaven 
I hope I get there 

Seen a million places 
Seen a million faces die 
And I wonder who will walk with me 
When I get there 

See this woman sitting next to me 
She's been there for a long, long time 
And when I fell, she picked me up 
When I cried, she wiped my tears 
I thank god she's mine 
And when I leave this world 
She won't have anything 
But her love for me 
'Cause the man took everything else 
Made me hate myself 
So just let her be boy 
Won't you let her be
