Once there were green fields
Kissed by the sun
Once there were valleys
Where rivers used to run
Once there were blue skies
With white clouds high above
Once they were part of
An everlasting love
We were the lovers who
Strolled through green fields

Green fields are gone now
Parched by the sun
Gone from the valleys
Where rivers used to run
Gone with the cold wind
That swept into my heart
Gone with the lovers
Who let their dreams depart

Where are the green fields
That we used to roam?

I'll never know what
Made you run away
How can I keep searching
When dark clouds hide the day

I only know there's
Nothing here for me
Nothing in this wide world
Left for me to see

Still I'll keep on waiting
Until you return
I'll keep on waiting
Until the day you learn
You can't be happy
While your heart's on the roam
You can't be happy
Until you bring it home
Home to the green fields
And me once again
