Mr. Telephone man
There's something wrong with my line,
When I dial my baby's number
I get a click every time
Mr. Telephone Man
There's something wrong with my line
When I dial my baby's number
I get a click every time

When I dial 611 Computer Service
She said "Hello. May I help you, please?"
I told her something must be wrong with my phone
'Cause my baby wouldn't hang up on me

Mr. Telephone Man
There's something wrong with my line
When I dial my baby's number
I get a click every time
Mr. Telephone Man
There's something wrong with my line
When I dial my baby's number
I get a click every time

She let the phone ring 20 times before she answered
Let me tell you what happened then
A minute later
I got the operator
Saying, "Please hang up and place your call again."

Mr. Telephone Man
There's something wrong with my line
When I dial my baby's number
I get a click every time
Mr. Telephone Man,
Something's wrong with my line
I try to dial her number
I get a click every time

Some strange man is on the telephone
He keeps telling me my baby ain't home
She got no party line
The situation's blowing my mind
Oh, I just can't take this anymore

Please operator
See what you can do,
I dialed the right number
But I still couldn't get through
Could you just check the line
Just one more time if you can?
I'm pretty sure her phone
Wouldn't be answered by no man

Mr. Telephone Man
There's something wrong with my line
When I dial my baby's number
I get a click every time
Mr. Telephone Man,
Something's wrong with my line
I try to dial her number
I get a click every time

Must be a bad connection
I give her my love and affection
I just can't take this no more
This situation's blowing my mind
Blowing my mind
Can't get my baby on the line

I tried dialing information 
Mr. Telephone Man
I can't get no cooperation 
Mr. Telephone Man
Her sister's on the phone
Telling me my baby ain't at home
Come on, baby, I just can't take it no more

Help me out
Please Mr. Telephone Man
Help me out
Please Mr. Telephone Man
