Atta way to go, you finally broke it off
Atta way to go, we can't even talk or cry
Or even wonder why that a way to go

Didn't you believe me when I loved you
I guess you thought we were playing games
All this time I tried to think I've known you
I guess I really only knew your name

Atta way to go, you finally broke it off
Atta way to go, we can't even talk or cry
Or even wonder why that a way to go

I thought you knew I lived my life just for you
There was just no price to big to pay
And even though I know I still live for you
The feeling's that you show won't let me stay

Atta way to go, you finally broke it off
Atta way to go, we can't even talk or cry
Or even wonder why that a way to go
