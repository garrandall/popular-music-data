Got a bed wit' your name on it
Wit' your name on it
Got a kiss wit' your name on it
Wit' your name on it


Thousand dollar sheets
Waitin' for you on some thousand dollar sheets
I got Carter III on repeat
Back shots to the beat of "A Milli" on you
Got me acting like you got a milli on you
He say I'm the GOAT, yeah, the billy on you
I could make all your dreams come true
Wanna fall through, then you better come through


Don't make me wait until the morning

Got a bed wit' your name on it
Wit' your name on it
Got a kiss wit' your name on it
Wit' your name on it
Love me good, love me down
Don't turn me down
Got a bed wit' your name on it
Wit' your name on it


Strawberry lingerie
Waitin' for you, strawberries, lingerie
You told me you on the way
Mess around, mess around, put it down on you
I'ma do everything I said I'm gon' do
Pretty little body, it look better on you
Might have to blow it like a feather on you
Waterfalls, oh, yeah, you better come through


Don't make me wait until the morning

Got a bed wit' your name on it
Wit' your name on it
Got a kiss wit' your name on it
Wit' your name on it
Love me good, love me down
Don't turn me down
Got a bed wit' your name on it (Oh, yeah)
Wit' your name on it (On it)


O-on, on it (On it)
O-on, on it
O-on, on it
O-on, on it (but I put your name... on it)


Yo! He in my startin' five, he get his city live
These niggas scared, they doing fifty in a fifty-five
I'm tryna clap him like somebody told him, "Gimme five!"
I'ma be a half an hour, but I told him, "Gimme five!"
I'm tryna dance on him, blow my advance on 'em
I like him better when he got some sweatpants on him
I like his hang time, he said his head right
I said go all the way down and then head right
I watch him fuck it up, look at him luckin' up
I said, "You need some thick skin, baby, suck it up."
He go insane on it, I put my fame on it
Coulda put ZAYN on it, but I put your name on it


I got a bed wit' your name on it
Wit' your name on it
Got a kiss wit' your name on it
Wit' your name on it, yeah
Love me good, love me down
Don't turn me down (Turn it down, baby)
Got a bed wit' your name on it (Your name...)
Wit' your name on it
