Said I'm scared, Lord, I'm scared, I'm terrified
Never been much on religion
But I sure enough would like to hear the call
I'm scared, Lordy Lord, I'm shaking, I'm petrified
Never been much on religion
But I sure enough just fell down on my knees

I heard the choir singing
Something about good will toward men
And even sleeping in heavenly peace
Stopped by to see Saint Thomas
On a cold and dreary New York afternoon
Something in the air was oh so rare
I don't know what it was but I know
That it's still right there

And I'm scared, Lordy Lord, I'm shaking, I'm terrified
Never been much on religion
But I sure enough just fell down on my knees

Living in confusion
Searching for truth that I never found
I needed something to really believe
Looked toward the heavens
On a dark and stormy winter afternoon
Something in the air was oh so rare
I'm not really sure what it was
But I know for sure that it's still right there

And I'm scared, hey, I'm terrified
Never been much on religion
But I sure enough just fell down on my knees

Oh, I'm scared, you know I'm shakin'
I'm layin' awake thinkin' about it now, I'm terrified
Never been much on religion
But I sure enough would like to hear the call
Come on now, give me a sign you're listening to me

You hear me talking, you hear me crying
It's confusing to me, Lord, I'm terrified
Never been much on religion
But I sure enough just fell down on my knees, oh
