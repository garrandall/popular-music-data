Let's say were sorry, before it's too late, give forgiveness a chance
Turn the anger into water; let it slip through our hands
We all bleed red, we all taste rain, all fall down, lose our way
We all say words we regret, we all cry tears, we all bleed red

If we're fighting, we're both losing; we're just wasting our time
Because my scars, they are your scars and your world is mine
You and I, we all bleed red, we all taste rain, all fall down, lose our way
We all say words, we regret, we all cry tears, we all bleed red
Sometimes we're strong, sometimes we're weak, sometimes we're hurt and it cuts deep
We live this life, breath to breath, we're all the same; we all bleed red



Let's say we're sorry...
Before it's too late...

We all bleed red, all taste rain, all fall down, lose our way
We all say words we regret, we all cry tears we all bleed red
Sometimes we're strong, sometimes we're weak; sometimes we're hurt
It cuts deep; we live this life breath to breath; we're all the same
We all bleed r-e-e-e-d-d-d
