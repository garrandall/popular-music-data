Play this record as frequently as possible
Then, as it becomes easier for you
Play the record once a day or as needed

Let me hear you say (oh oh baby)
If the rhythm feels good to you baby

Mocedes the Mellow, quite a nice fellow
Met 3T, hit a rhyme, acapello
They had the rhythm and I had the rhyme
So then a hit of that one more time
It worked out and then they worked it in
Tony! Toni! Ton√©! has done it again


Feels good, yeah

It feeeeels good

I feel it all in my hands
I feel it all in my feet
I feel it all in my bones
I feel it all in my bones
I feel it all in my feet
I feel it all in my heart
I feel it all in my soul
