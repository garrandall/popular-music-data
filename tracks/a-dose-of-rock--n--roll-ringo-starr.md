All right!

You're feelin' down,
You're feelin' blue.
You do know that you care,
But you don't know what to do.

If your mama don't feel good,
Or your daddy don't feel good,
Take a dose of rock'n'roll
And wash it down with cool, clear soul, aha.

(shoo bop, shoo wow wow)

You better get your ripple soles out, (shoo bop, shoo wow wow)
Ease out all your mean controls. (shoo bop, shoo wow wow)
Take a dose of rock'n'roll
And wash it down with cool, clear soul, aha.

Turn on your radio,
Start dancin' to the moon.
That old heart radio,
It's gonna get you, (get you) get you, (get you) get you in the mood.

You better get your ripple soles out, (shoo bop, shoo wow wow)
Ease out all your mean controls. (shoo bop, shoo wow wow)
Take a dose of rock'n'roll
And wash it down with cool, clear soul, aha.

(shoo bop, shoo wow wow)

Turn on your radio,
Start dancin' to the moon.
That old heart radio,
It's gonna get you, (get you) get you, (get you) get you in the mood.

If your mama don't feel good, (shoo bop, shoo wow wow)
Or your daddy don't feel so good, (shoo bop, shoo wow wow)
Take a dose of rock'n'roll
And wash it down with cool, clear soul, aha.

Take a dose of rock'n'roll,
Take a dose of rock'n'roll,
Take a dose of rock'n'roll,
Wash it down with cool, clear soul, aha.

Hey, hey, baby, (dose of rock'n'roll)
Why don't you take some rock'n'roll? (take some rock'n'roll)
Just take some rock'n'roll, (take some rock'n'roll)
Oh, oh, take some! (take some rock'n'roll)
Oh, I'm gonna take it! (take some rock'n'roll)
Take some rock'n'roll! (take some rock'n'roll)
