Here, when all my work is done
She calls and she says, dear, can I come?
I say to her, that you know our love has gone
But aggressive heart, you're really not the one
She comes to the door, crying at my feet
Guilt shines in her eyes
As she slowly sinks in deep
You know our love couldn't last forever
Persuade your way, but you ain't clever
I close the door and I say never
I don't care, what you're sayin'
Walk right now, I ain't playin'
Love elsewhere, for you I'm prayin'
Don't look back, you ain't stayin'
Here, I'm crying, I can't sleep
I sigh, cause I thought this would never be
I say ohh, I'm screamin' out for someone
And now she's knockin' on the door for me
She just won't leave me alone
She wants to speak with me
And persuade me in her arms
And now she's callin' on the phone for me
Just won't leave me alone
Deep down inside she's trying to be clever
To love once more then leave me forever
I close the door and I say never
I don't care, what you're sayin'
Walk right now, I ain't playin'
Love elsewhere, for you I'm prayin'
Don't look back, you ain't stayin'
(Repeat)
I try so hard to cope with you
I can't bear with the things you put me through
To love as friends, I wish that we could see
But persuasive heart, you just won't let pure friendship be
You know our love couldn't last forever
Persuade your way, but you ain't clever
I close the door and I say never
I don't care, what you're sayin'
Walk right now, I ain't playin'
Love elsewhere, for you I'm prayin'
Don't look back, you ain't stayin'
(Repeat)
