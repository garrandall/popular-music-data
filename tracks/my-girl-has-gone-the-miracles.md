When you were mine I loved you so much
A got a thrill from your every touch
You went away with somebody else
Now all I can say to comfort myself


Is that my girl has gone and said goodbye
Don't you cry, hold your head up high
And don't give up, give love one more try
'Cause there's a right girl for every guy


Baby, all your love wasn't right for me
Good for another it well may be
Some girls just weren't made for some guys
Now I've got to make myself realize


That my girl has gone (yes, she has)
And said goodbye (I tell myself that)
Don't you cry, hold your head up high
(Keep on trying)
Don't give up, give love one more try
(Believe me now)
There's a right girl for every guy, oh yeah


I've got the feelin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah baby

Now happiness and all the best
That's all that I wish for you, oh yeah
Don't be like me in misery
I'm feelin' so sad and blue
I said I'm sad and I'm blue, oh yeah
Sad and I'm blue, I said I'm sad and I'm blue


Because my girl has gone and said goodbye
(but I told myself)
Don't you cry, hold your head up high
(Keep on trying)
Don't give up, give love one more try
(Believe me now)
There's a right girl for every guy
(And I can't go on if I hear you say)
My girl has gone (yes you can) and said goodbye
(And I start to cry, I say)
Don't you cry, hold your head up high
(Oh, wee)
Don't give up, give love one more try
(Oh my)
There's a right girl for every guy
