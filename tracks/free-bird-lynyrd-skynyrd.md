When we was ridin' down the road with the wind in our hair
She was singin' Lynyrd Skynyrd like ain't nobody there
She sang "and this bird you can not change"

I watch her sing I watch her dance
I watch her move up in them pants
She's down for me and she's down to ride
I'm tryin' to see if she's down tonight
The harder I mash the louder she gets
I'm swervin' fast from ditch to ditch
When I slow it down she said "what the hell"
You havin' fun well I can tell
Baby doll that's kinda my style
I slow it down and cruise a while
I watch you grin, I see you smile
Just kickin' it with my country dime
Let's head down to the creek, baby put one in the air
'Cause as long as I'm with you, hell I don't even care

'Cause she's my Patsy Cline, Tanya Tucker, Broadway Bette Davis
She's tearin' up my truck my Mrs. Underwood is gettin' crazy
Reba McEntire she fancy I know she fine
My two cents says she's a dime, know she gets it all the time
Off in them backwoods we cruisin' foot on the gas I don't plan to stop
Swear I give her everything I can but I don't have a lot
She's my Bonnie to my Clyde and she finally arrived
Told my baby slow it down, she told me shut up and drive

When we was ridin' down the road with the wind in our hair
She was singin' Lynyrd Skynyrd like ain't nobody there
She sang "and this bird you can not change"
Ain't got a dollar to our name just a cooler of beer
Long as she's sittin' shotgun man I don't even care
She sang "and this bird you can not change"

Yeah, hey

I called her shotgun Sally with a Fireball bottle
In that bikini top with them sunglasses and the earrings shaped like sand dollas
We roll, from that red clay to the sea salt air of the beaches
They can stare but believe me this Georgia boy ain't sharin' these peaches
She got a look on her face like well you better hit the gas no brake lights
Shook that thing like a diamond back and my neck stays red from the snake bites
Road dogs we the definition, let's ride out we forever missin'
And every kiss is evidence that it's better when that's where she's sittin'

Meet me on them two paths right off of them backroads
Front seat gettin' moved back, let's just see where that goes
Slow and easy goin' we got nothin' but time
She get's me goin' knowin' damn well she's blowin' my mind
But it's fine she's got a way to chill me out when it ain't all good
When the money ain't flowin' like it should
Baby girl you know I'd buy you the world if I could
She said naw just take me drinkin' ridin' 'round in them woods

When we was ridin' down the road with the wind in our hair
She was singin' Lynyrd Skynyrd like ain't nobody there
She sang "and this bird you can not change"
Ain't got a dollar to our name just a cooler of beer
Long as she's sittin' shotgun man I don't even care
She sang "and this bird you can not change"

When we was ridin' down the road with the wind in our hair
She was singin' Lynyrd Skynyrd like ain't nobody there
She sang "and this bird you can not change"
Ain't got a dollar to our name just a cooler of beer
Long as she's sittin' shotgun man I don't even care
She sang "and this bird you can not change"
