If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
For I must be traveling on, now
Cause there's too many places I've got to see
But, if I stayed here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same
Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you can not change


Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And this bird you can not change
And this bird you can not change
Lord knows, I can't change

Bye, bye, baby, it's been a sweet love
Though this feeling I can't change
But please don't take it so badly
Cause Lord knows I'm to blame
But, if I stayed here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same
Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you'll never change


Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And this bird you can not change
And this bird you can not change
Lord knows, I can't change
Lord help me, I can't change


Lord, I can't change
Won't you fly high, free bird, yeah
