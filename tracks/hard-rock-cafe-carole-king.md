Downtown anywhere USA
You can find yourself a Hard Rock Cafe
Put your money on a number, anyone can play
Come on and tell us all about what happened to you today

At the Hard Rock Cafe, come to the Hard Rock Cafe
I hope you can find your way to the Hard Rock Cafe

After a hard day's work I guarantee
There just isn't anywhere better to be
If you're unable to find good company
You can always sit down and watch the color T.V.

At the Hard Rock Cafe, come to the Hard Rock Cafe
The regulars can't keep away from the Hard Rock Cafe

And if you're feeling just a little bit lonely
Don't sit at home just mopin'
Come on down to where the spirits flow so freely
You know the door is always open

At the Hard Rock Cafe, come to the Hard Rock Cafe
They will help keep your blues at bay
At the Hard Rock Cafe
