For the love of money
You would lie to your mother
For the love of money
You would steal from your own brother

For the love of money
People can't even walk the streets
They never know who in the world they're gonna meet
For that mean, mean green

Oh mighty dollar, yeah
Money, money, money, money

Some people got to have it, yeah
Some people really need it
Talkin' y'all do things, do things, do things, bad things with it
Money, money, money, money

Oh, you gotta do things, do things, do things, do things with it
Money, money, money, money
For that mean
Mean green

Oh mighty dollar
Ow!

Oh baby girl
Cash, money
Anytime

Oh! Whoa yeah!
Whoa whoa yeah!

Don't you know my name
The root of all evil
Do funny, funny things to ya
Give me a nickel

Brother, can you spare a dime
If you think you're children know it
Out of your mind

Listen up
I say

For the love of money
Don't let money fool ya
Don't you let, don't you let, don't you let the money fool ya

For the love of money
Ow!
Don't let money fool ya
Don't, don't, BulletBoys say

For the love of money
Don't let money fool ya
Oh don't lie to your mother

For the love of money
Don't let money fool ya
All I got left to say, let freshen money no more

For the love of money
Oh yeah yeah
Don't let money fool ya

For the love of money
Don't let money fool ya
