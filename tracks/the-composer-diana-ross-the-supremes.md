You may not how
To make words rhyme
Carry a tune or a clap on time now
You may have no knowledge of musical things

But deep down inside of me
You have created a melody
You're the composer of the song
That my heart sings

You may not what
Quarter notes are
Or what I mean by Four to the Bar now
Such musical terms may be Greek to your ears

But deep down inside of me
You have created a melody
You're the composer of the song
That my heart hears

Now it's a tender song
It's like a rhapsody, a symphony
This song I find in this heart of mine
And it's begging you
Let nothing keep us apart
Oh, my darling
'Cause you put a song in my heart

Now this song that I find in my heart for you
Every lyric and line
I swear it's true
The number one song on my personal chart

Deep down inside of me
You have created a melody
You're the composer of the song
That's in my heart

Deep down inside of me
You have created a symphony
You're the composer
You put a song in my heart
You're the composer
You put a song in my heart
You're the composer
You put a song in my heart
