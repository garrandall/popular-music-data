You know I'm not
your lover now
it might as well be said
and then you say
you're leaving
Or maybe I'm just
hanging on a thread
When I gave you everything
it didn't seem that much
You gave me your opinion
with the usual
heavy handed touch

What can I do
About the rain that falls on you
I'm not your lover now
I'm not your lover now

What can I do
About the rain that falls on you
I'm not your lover now
I'm not your lover now

My head is spinning endlessly
My sense won't react
Then I'm falling through a black hole
Part of me is never coming back

How you can lose a thing
you never really had

And you always hurt the one you love
and you just love to hurt me bad

What can I do
About the rain that falls on you
I'm not your lover now
I'm not your lover now

What can I do
About the sky that falls on you
I'm not your lover

You really must be going now
By god, is that the time?
Let me put you out
of my misery
They call it being cruel
to be kind
I only insult my friends
my friend
The rest can go to hell
You can read it
anyway you want
oh well, you're not so bad yourself

What can I do
About the rain that falls on you
I'm not your lover now
I'm not your lover now
