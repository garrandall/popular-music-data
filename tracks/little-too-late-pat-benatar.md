I hear you had a good offer down on third avenue
You tell me that was the reason for whatcha', you put me through, yeah
And now you come collapsin' back I feel the heat of your attack
Want me to take you back I'm givin' you the sack so don't waste your time

It's a little too little, it's a little too late
I'm a little too hurt and there's nothin' left that I've gotta say
You can cry to me baby but there's only so much I can take
Oh, it's a little too little it's a little too late

You say you had a good time but did ya' think it was for free, yeah
And how much did it get ya' and all their flattery
And now you come back, runnin' for protection
You've been bitten by love and stung by rejection
You can't connect what did you expect? I'm still gettin' over you

It's a little too little, it's a little too late
I'm a little too hurt and there's nothin' left that I've gotta say
You can cry to me baby but there's only so much I can take
Oh, it's a little too little it's a little too late

It's a little too little, it's a little too late
I'm a little too hurt and there's nothin' left that I've gotta say
You can cry to me baby but there's only so much I can take
Oh, it's a little too little it's a little too late

It's a little too little, it's a little too late
I'm a little too hurt and there's nothin' left that I've gotta say
Well you can cry to me baby but there's only so much
Only so much I can take
Oh, it's a little too little it's a little too late

It's a little too little, it's a little too late
I'm a little too hurt and there's nothin' left that I've gotta say
Well you can cry to me baby but there's only so much
Only so much I can take
Oh, it's a little too little, it's a little too little
It's a little too little it's a little too late
