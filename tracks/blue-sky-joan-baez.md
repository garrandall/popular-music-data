Walk along the river
Sweet lullaby
It just keeps on flowing
It don't worry 'bout where it's going
No, no
Don't fly, mister blue bird
I'm just walking down the road
Early morning sunshine
Tell me all I need to know

You're my blue sky
You're my sunny day
Lord, you know it makes me high
When you turn your love my way
Turn your love my way

Good old Sunday morning
Bells are ringing everywhere
Going to Carolina
It won't be long and I'll be there

You're my blue sky
You're my sunny day
Lord, you know it makes me high
When you turn your love my way
Turn your love my way
