There you are
Looking just the same as you did last time I touched you
And here I am
Close to getting tangled up inside the thought of you
Do you love him
As much as I love her
And will that love be strong
When old feelings start to stir

Looks like we made it
Left each other on the way
To another love
Looks like we made it
Or I thought so till today
Until you were there, everywhere
And all I could taste was love the way we made it

Loves so strange
Playing hide and seek with hearts and always hurting
And we're the fools
Standing close enough to touch those burning memories
And if I hold you
For the sake of all those times
Love made us lose our minds
Could I ever let you go

Oh no we made it
Left each other on the way
To another love
Looks like we made it
Or I thought so till today
Until you were there, everywhere
And all I could taste was love the way we made it
Oh we made it

Looks like we made it
Left each other on the way
To another love
Looks like we made it
Or I thought so till today
Until you were there, everywhere
And all I could taste is love the way we made it
Looks like we made it
Whoa babe we made it
