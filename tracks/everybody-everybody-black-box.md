You won't belong to me
I let you down
I walk around and see your night skyline
I feel the light but you don't want to stay
So lonely now, just let me off downtown

Set it free, set it free
Set it free, set it free

When I said it was over, you aimed at my heart
Won't be long for I'm leavin', oh my love
But I feel it forever no time in my life
You can call that the livin' on my own so free


Everybody everybody
Everybody everybody
Everybody everybody
Everybody everybody


You took me easy and then let me go
I never was you see, that cheatin' kind
You feel alright, you never look for me
So long, it's time I gotta get on back

Set it free, set it free
Set it free, set it free

When I said it was over, you aimed at my heart
Won't be long for I'm leavin', oh my love
But I feel it forever no time in my life
You can call that the livin' on my own so free



Oh everybody
Oh everybody
Everybody
Oh everybody
Oh everybody



Oh everybody
Oh everybody
Everybody
Oh everybody
