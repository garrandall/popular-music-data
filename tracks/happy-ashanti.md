Woo, ha ha right back at ya..
it's the world's most talented record label
Murder Inc.
And that angelic voice you hear in the backround,
oh that's our new princess of Hip Hop in R&B yo
Miss Ashanti.


Boy you fill me with so much joy,
you give whatever it is I need
my love here to stay won't ever leave,
so glad that you fell in love with me.


My love is so good that I wouldn't be without you
babe,
couldn't see me without you babe.
My love is so good that I wouldn't be without you
babe couldn't see me without you baby.


all my life I've been searching for you,
everyday. So glad that I found you boy,
all my life I've been feeling for you everyday.
I'm so happy baby.


Boy you got me feeling so good,
you take all my pain away from me..
without you around I couldn't be
and I
know you fell in love with me.






I'm so happy that I fell in love,
I thank God he sent you from up above.
I'm so happy that I found someone,
and I thank God he sent you from above.

Hm that I wouldn't be without you babe
couldn't see me without you babe and I wouldn't be
without you babe couldn't see me without you baby.
