Bobby Vinton
Written by Jimmie Crane and Al Jacobs

Peaked at # 24 in 1972
Originally charted as "Ev'ry Day Of My Life" at # 37 by the Mcguire Sisters in 1956

Ev'ry day of my life I'll be in love with you
Ev'ry day of my life I promise I'll be true
I'll never make you cry and, as the years go by
I'll always try to do what pleases you

Ev'ry day of my life I'll need you close to me
And if I have my way that's where you'll always be
I'll prove how much I love you over and over again
Ev'ry moment I live, ev'ry day of my life

(Ev'ry day of my life)
I'll need you close to me
(And if I have my way)
That's where you'll always be
Oh, I'll prove how much I love you over and over again
Ev'ry moment I live, ev'ry day of my life
