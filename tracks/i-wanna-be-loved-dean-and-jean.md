I wanna be loved with inspiration
I wanna be loved starting tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

Instead of merely holding conversation
Whoa, hold me tight, uh huh
Oh, hold me tight, uh huh

I wanna be kissed (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Until I tingle (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I wanna be kissed (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Starting tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

And grace me til our heartbeats
Set amingle, whoa, wrong or right
Uh huh, whoa, wrong or right, oh

I feel like acting my age
I'm past the stage of
Merely turtle doving, whoa, oh

I'm in no mood to resist
And I insist the world
Owes me a love, whoa

I wanna be thrilled (yeah, yeah, yeah)
To desperation (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I wanna be thrilled (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Starting tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

With every kind of wonderful sensation
Whoa, I wanna be loved
I wanna be loved

Come on, come on, come on
I wanna be loved
Right now, right now, right now

I wanna be loved
Don't you wait until tomorrow
I said I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
I wanna be loved

Yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna be loved
