Just when I'm ready to throw in my hand
Just when the best things in life are gone
I look into your eyes

There's no smoke without fire.
You're exactly who I want to be with.
Without you
What would I do?

And when I'm willing to call it a day
Just when I won't take another chance
I hold your hand

There's no smoke without fire.
Woman, I love you.
Without you
What would I do?
