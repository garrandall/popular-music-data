Baby, what are we becoming?
It feels just like we're always running
Rolling through the motions every day
I could lean in to hold you
Or act like I don't even know you
Seems like you could care less either way
What happened to that girl I used to know?
I just want us back to the way we were before


Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby


Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Baby, do I?


Remember when we didn't have nothing
But a perfect simple kind of loving?
Baby, those sure were the days
There was a time our love ran wild and free
But now I'm second guessing everything I see!


Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby


Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?


Baby, do I still give you what you need?
Still take your breath away?
Light up the spark way down deep?
Baby, do I?!


Whoa! Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby


Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Tell me baby, do I get one more try? Do I?
Baby, do I?
