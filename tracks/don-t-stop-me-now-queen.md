Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive
And the world, I'll turn it inside out, yeah
I'm floating around in ecstasy, so (Don't stop me now)
(Don't stop me) 'Cause I'm havin' a good time, havin' a good time


I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go, there's no stopping me


I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man outta you


(Don't stop me now)
I'm having such a good time, I'm having a ball
(Don't stop me now)
If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call
(Don't stop me now) 'Cause I'm having a good time
(Don't stop me now) Yes, I'm having a good time
I don't wanna stop at all, yeah


I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars on a collision course
I am a satellite, I'm out of control
I'm a sex machine ready to reload
Like an atom bomb about to, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode!


I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you


(Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me) Hey, hey, hey
(Don't stop me, don't stop me, oh oohohoh like it
(Don't stop me, don't stop me) Have a good time, good time
(Don't stop me, don't stop me) Woah
Let loose, honey, all right




Oh, I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit, hey
Travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man outta you (Yeah, yeah)


(Don't stop me now)
I'm having such a good time, I'm having a ball
(Don't stop me now)
If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call (Oh alright)
(Don't stop me now) 'Cause I'm having a good time (Yeah, yeah)
(Don't stop me now) Yes, I'm having a good time
I don't wanna stop at all


Ah, da da da da
Da da ah ah
Ah da da, ah ah ah
Ah, da da
Ah, da da ah ah
Oh ohoohohohoh
