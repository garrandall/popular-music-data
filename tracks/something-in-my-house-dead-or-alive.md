I,I,IIIII I,I,IIIII, I am being haunted

It's four o'clock in the morning
And I'm sitting on my stairs
And there's bangin' round the bedroom
But no one knows there's no one there
And I am here all by myself
And you're somewhere else with someone else
And I am being haunted by a love that isn't there

There is something in my house - my house
It's just a ghost of a long long dead affair
There is something in my house - my house
I just keep a hearing you runnin' on up my stairs
But you're not there

I really gotta say it to ya
Ya showed me a good time
But for every minute that you spent laughin'
There were hours that I cried
And I think about what might have been
If I'd never met that wicked queen
And my heart broke into pieces at midnight on Halloween

There is something in my house - my house
It's just a ghost of a long long dead affair
There is something in my house - my house
I just keep a hearing you runnin' on up my stairs
But you're not there

It's just a ghost of a long long dead affair

There is something in my house - my house

But you're not there

I,I,IIIII I,I,IIIII,I am being haunted

And I am here all by myself
And you're somewhere else with someone else
And I am being haunted by a love that isn't there

There is something in my house - my house
It's just a ghost of a long long dead affair
There is something in my house - my house
I just keep a hearing you runnin' on up my stairs
But you're not there

It's just a ghost of a long long dead affair

There is something in my house - my house
It's just a ghost of a long long dead affair
There is something in my house - my house
I just keep a hearing you runnin' on up my stairs
But you're not there

It's just a ghost of a long long dead affair
