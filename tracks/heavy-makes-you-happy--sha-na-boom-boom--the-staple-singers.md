Ahh, whoa, great gosh, a mighty

(Sha-na-boom boom, yeah)
Say it, y'all
(Sha-na-boom boom, yeah)
Tell me, tell me, tell me, come on

(Sha-na-boom boom, yeah)
Well, well
(Sha-na-na-na-boom boom, yeah)

I've been trying to find what's heavy
That's been messing up my mind
I think I found the answer
'Cause it was right there all the time

Heavy makes you happy
I just got to say
Put on your heavy
If I can't feel this way

(Sha-na-boom boom, yeah)
Come on, come on
(Sha-na-boom boom, yeah)

Do it, do it, do it, do it
(Sha-na-boom boom, yeah)
(Sha-na-na-na-boom boom, yeah)

By talking to my people
You know that it occurred to me
It's more than just a feeling
It's a philosophy

Heavy makes you happy
Drying up your drink
Oh, spread a little heavy
And it makes somebody sing

(Sha-na-boom boom, yeah)
Come on, y'all
(Sha-na-boom boom, yeah)

Right on, right on, right on
(Sha-na-boom boom, yeah)
(Sha-na-na-na-boom boom, yeah)

(Sha-na-boom boom, yeah)
A little bit softer, now
(Sha-na-boom boom, yeah)

Oh, do it easy, now
(Sha-na-boom boom, yeah)
Lay it on down
(Sha-na-na-na-boom boom, yeah)

(Sha-na-boom boom, yeah)
A little bit softer, now
(Sha-na-boom boom, yeah)

Oh, do it easy, now
(Sha-na-boom boom, yeah)
Lay it on down
(Sha-na-na-na-boom boom, yeah)
