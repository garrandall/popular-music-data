I met her at the club, then I said "wassup?"
I took her to the crib and you know I fucked
Yeah, toot it and boot it, toot it and boot it
Toot it and boot it, that's right I toot and boot it


She think I'm cute, she wanna have sex
Girl, knock it off, you know you can't have this
She think I'm cute, she wanna have sex
Girl knock it off, you know you can't have this
And she told me run that I told her run it
And she never seen a trick until she met my magic stick
Girl, I'm a pimp spit straight game, never no simp'
And after we did it she was walking with a limp
Bust it open, leave it wet, you know I leave it soakin'
Who next? I don't ever close, I stay open
I met her in the club, you know I was drunk
I asked her name and then I said: "I wanna fuck"
And I'm YG and you know I fucked
And she fucked back like a little slut
And she fell in love, yeah and she felt stupid
Cause you know, I toot it and boot it


I met her at the club, then I said "wassup?"
I took her to the crib and you know I fucked
Yeah, toot it and boot it, toot it and boot it
Toot it and boot it, that's right I toot and boot it


Girl let me toot that boot that stop actin' stupid
Acting like you don't know me, like "Who that?"
Walked in the club, but I'll fly things
I'm in the back girl, you know where to find me
And I love how she think I'm cute
And she don't even wanna tell me what she wanna do
It's me and my crew, her and her friends
And they all trying to leave with us when the club ends
And she toot it from the back
And you know she made it clap
And you know I run it back like only for one night
And she know I'm on like a switch on light
Hey girl, I can have you feelin' right
I can supply the pipe, just make sure it's tight
We can do it all day, only for one night
And after that you gotta go cause you ain't my wife


I met her at the club, then I said "wassup?"
I took her to the crib and you know I fucked
Yeah, toot it and boot it, toot it and boot it
Toot it and boot it, that's right I toot and boot it


I toot it to the left, I toot it to the right
Fuck with me, we gonna do it all night
I seen a bad bitch, I swing my hat back
And after I hit, I still on my back
Cause I toot it and boot it
And made her feel stupid
Cause I toot it and boot it
And made her feel stupid


I met her at the club, then I said wassup
I took her to the crib and you know I fucked
Yeah, toot it and boot it, toot it and boot it
Toot it and boot it, that's why I toot and boot it
