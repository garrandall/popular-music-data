Long time gone away from me
I knew that you'd return
I've gone through this many times
By now, you'd think I'd learn

That you'll be coming back again
Come home and turn the key
Then we will dance
And we will sing
If only you would come with me

Oh, baby

I'll make you music
I'll give you sunshine
Why don't you come along?
We'll be together
Happy forever
Singing our own sweet song

Oh, I'll make you music
Lots of fine music
Just like we always do
And I know you love me
You really love me
And baby, I love you too

When I'm with you
I can feel a burning heat inside
You can go away from me
But you can never hide

Love is strong
And you'll return
No telling where or when
So stay while and watch me smile
It's so good to have you home again

Oh, baby

I'll make you music
I'll give you sunshine
Why don't you come along?
We'll be together
Happy forever
Singing our own sweet song

Oh, I'll make you music
Lots of fine music
Just like we always do
And I know you love me
You really love me
And baby, I love you too

I'll make you music
I'll give you sunshine
Why don't you come along?
We'll be together
Happy forever
Singing our own sweet song

Oh, I'll make you music
Lots of fine music
Just like we always do
And I know you love me
You really love me
And baby, I love you too

I'll make you music
I'll give you sunshine
Why don't you come along?
We'll be together
Happy forever
Singing our own sweet song

Oh, I'll make you music
Lots of fine music
Just like we always do
And I know you love me
You really love me
And baby, I love you too
