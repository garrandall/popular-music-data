I'm not gonna say everything is OK 
Cause OK is not the way that I feel. 
I'm not gonna be any fool's Christmas tree 
Let 'em hang gifts on me that aren't real 

I'm not gonna take second best 
I've got no use for the rest. 
World you better hear what I say 
Cause for me true love could be 
100 years away. 

I'm not givin' in to a smile or a grin 
On a face -huh- I might never see again. 
I'm not gonna fly in some big phony sky 
On a ride that I know just can't win. 

And I'm not gonna take second best 
No I've got no use for the rest. 
So world you better hear what I say 
Cause for me true love could be 
100 years away. 

And if it is, I'll wait
