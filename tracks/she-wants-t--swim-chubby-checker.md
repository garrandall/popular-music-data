Groupshe wants t swim
She wants t swim
She wants t swim
Cci come around just to get some lovin'
Groupsha la la she wants t swim
Cci just want some good good lovin'
Groupsha la la she wants t swim
Cci wanna let her know
I wanna love her so
Never get a chance
Groupsha la la she wants t swim
Ccwe hit the floor for a hour or two now
Groupsha la la she wants t swim
Ccthen I say baby what cha wanna do now
Groupsha la la she wants t swim
Ccbaby can't sit down
She moves around like a hound
In a trance
Groupsha la la she wants t swim
Ccall she wants to do is monkey
All she wants to do is swim
Then she wanna hully gully
Never do what I wanna do
All she wants to do is cha cha
Then she wanna do the dog
Don't forget the wah-watusi

Groupsha la la she wants t swim
Ccall she wants to do is monkey
All she wants to do is swim
Then she wants a hully gully
Never do what I wanna do
All she wanna do is cha cha
Then she wanna do the dog
Don't forget the wah-watusi
Groupshe wants t swim
Ccdo it
Groupshe wants t swim
She wants t swim
