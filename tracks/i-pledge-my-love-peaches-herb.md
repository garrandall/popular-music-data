Always together
Together forever
Always together forever
I will love you till the day I die
I know this now and my love won't run dry
You came along my life has begun
Two hearts are now beating
As though they were one
Like the stars that make the night so bright
You shine on me with a love that's so right
A love that is lasting a love that's so pure
Each time I feel it, it makes me more sure

I know with all my heart we'll never part for
For this is the day that our love comes alive
And I mean what I say as I stand here saying
This is the day when our love comes alive
And I mean every word and I want you to know
That this is the day that our love comes alive
And I mean what I say if somebody should ask me

I pledge my love to you
I pledge my love is true
I pledge my life to you
I do my dear, I do my dear

Like a river finds the deep blue sea
Love took your hand and led you to me
This is the us that I'll never forget
Both sparkling with love both happy we met
I'm so proud to have you by my side
You be my strength and I'll be your guide
You are the one you're a dream that is real
Heaven has sent you it's love that I feel
I do, I pledge my love to you
