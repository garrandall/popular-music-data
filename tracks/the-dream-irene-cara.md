I've been chasing dreams for so long
Just one step behind and then they're gone
Illusions of love would come and go
I guess you have to hurt before you grow
And everybody knows
Never let go of the, never let go of the dream

I always seem to lose what I thought was mine
And many times I tried to leave it behind
Deep inside, hope was still alive
Deep inside, dreams will never die
That is why we're movin' closer to the truth

It's really great for me to be here
I've won over the pain and the fear
It's been so very hard through the years
Been looking through a rainbow of tears
And still I never really let go of the dream

Sometimes I saw my life just falling apart
And all the rejection tearing at my heart
Deep inside, hope was still alive
Deep inside, dreams will never die
If you try there'll be so much more for you

It's really great for me to be here
I've won over the pain and the fear
It's been so very hard through the years
Been looking through a rainbow of tears
And still I never really let go of the dream

We can all be free, we hold the key
If we can see what we wanna be
Life's never easy, you get no guarantees
Why not give your all and see what you can find?
