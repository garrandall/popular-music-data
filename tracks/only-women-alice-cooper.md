Man got his woman to take his seed
He got the power, oh
She got the need
She spends her life through
Pleasing up her man
She feeds him dinner or anything she can

She cries alone at night too often
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all

Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed

Man makes your hair gray
He's your life's mistake
All you're really lookin' for's
An even break
He lies right at you
You know you hate this game
Slaps you once in a while
And you live in love and pain

She cries alone at night too often
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all

Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed

Man got his woman to take his seed
He got the power, oh
She got the need
She spends her life through
Pleasing up her man
She feeds him dinner or anything she can

She cries alone at night too often
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all

Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed

Black eyes all of the time
"Don't spend a dime"
"Clean up this grime"
And you there down on your knees
Begging me please
Come watch me bleed

Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
