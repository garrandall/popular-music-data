(Make the world go away)
And get it off of my shoulders
(Say the things you used to say)
And make the world go away


I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'll make it up day by day
Just tell me you still love me
And make the world go away


(Make the world go away)
Just get it off, off of my shoulders
(Say the things you used to say)
Only you can make it go away


You remember when you loved me
Before the world took me astray
If you do then forgive me
And make the world go away


(Make the world go away)
Just get it off, off of my shoulders
(Say the things you used to say)
And make the world go away
