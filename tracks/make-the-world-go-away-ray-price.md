Make the world go away and get it off my shoulder
Say the things you used to say and make the world go away

Do you remember when you loved me, before the world took me astray
If you do then forgive me and make the world go away

Make the world go away and get it off my shoulder
Say the things you used to say and make the world go away

I'm sorry if I hurt you, I'll make it up day by day
Just say you love me like you used to and make the world go away

Make the world go away and get it off my shoulder
Say the things you used to say and make the world go away

Say the things you used to say and make the world go away
