Best of friends
Never part
Best of fools has loved forever
From the bottom of his heart

So why pretend
This is the end
You'll have to find out for yourself
Go on ask somebody else

Why can't you just get it through your head
It's over, it's over now
Yes, you heard me clearly now I said
It's over, it's over now

I'm not really over you
You might say that
I can't take it, I can't take it
Lord, I swear I just can't take it no more

(Go away) go away
(Far away) so far away
It's too late to turn back now
And it don't matter anyhow

'Cause you were right
I'm to blame
Can't go on the same old way
Can't keep up the same old game

Why can't you just get it through your head
It's over, it's over now
Yes, you heard me clearly now I said
It's over, it's over now

I'm not really over you
You might say that
I can't take it, I can't take it
Lord, I swear I just can't take it no more

Why can't you just get it through your head
It's over, it's over now
Yes, you heard me clearly now I said
It's over, it's over now
