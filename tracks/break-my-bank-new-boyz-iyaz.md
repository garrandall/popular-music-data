She make me wanna
(break my bank)
Give everything I got
Just to get a shot
(make it rain)
Where my money at
Where my money at

(break my bank)
Just forget about the tag
Throw it in the bag
(make it rain)

Shawty wanna break my
Shawty wanna break my bank

Damn Girl
You looked better than a video
Think I wanna break my bank
Hammer to the piggie tho
All them groupie girls getting
Jealous of what I spendin
They try to chop it up but
Aint the karate kid

Save it
Everyday im spending more on her
I don't buy shit
Like I barely hold the door open
And everytime I say this
Shit I always get a ...
When it comes to taxes
A nigga gon' be done for.

Break my bank
Give everything I got
Just to get a shot
(make it rain)
Where my money at
Where my money at

She make me wanna
(break my bank)
Just forget about the tag
Throw it in the bag
(make it rain)

Shawty wanna break my
Shawty wanna break my bank
Make me wanna break my
(my bank)
Make me wanna break
(my bank)

Ok
The start of my day I took
Her on a date
Had to scrape for some Change
So I went to the bank
But when I see her
She was so 'damn fine' like that
So I hit it right back
Pull out more stacks

Over drawn, low funds

Its, its like i've done
But I put her right back
Cos your boy is sprung
See she is so 'damn fine'
Got me spending
All this cash and its
Going to fast I need to watch my ass

Break my bank
Give everything I got
Just to get a shot
(make it rain)
Were my money at
Were my money at

(break my bank)
Just forget about the tag
Throw it in the bag
(make it rain)

Shawty wanna break my
Shawty wanna break my bank

Make me wanna break my
(my bank)
Make me wanna break my
(my bank)

If you a bad girl
And you need a little change
So your man gon' break his bank

If you a bad girl
And you tryin to get bank
Tell your man go break his bank

F you a bad girl
And you need a little change
So your man gon' break his bank

If you a bad girl
And you tryin to get bank
Tell your man go break his bank

She make me wanna
(break my bank)
Give everything I got
Just to get a shot
(make it rain)
Were my money at
Were my money at

Break my bank
Just forget about the tag
Throw it in the bag
(make it rain)

Shawty wanna break my
Shawty wanna break my bank
