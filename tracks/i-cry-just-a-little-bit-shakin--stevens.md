Every time you have to whisper goodbye
Well, I cry just a little bit
(Cry just a little bit)
I know it's crazy and I don't know why
But I died just a little bit
(Die just a little bit)

I need to be the one that's by your side
You are the beat in my heart
My love for you is something I can't hide
And I cry just a little bit
(Cry just a little bit)
Cry just a little bit
(Cry just a little bit)

Every night before I'm fallin' asleep
Well, I pray just a little bit
(Pray just a little bit)
I pray nobody wants your loving to keep
And you stray just a little bit
(Stray just a little bit)

Don't let temptation fill your heart with dreams
Don't let your mind run away
Forbidden love is never what it seems
And you cry just a little bit
(Cry just a little bit)
Cry just a little bit

You're the light that brightens all of my days
And the sun shines above you
And I would die if someone took you away
'Cause I love you, love you

(Cry just a little bit, cry just a little bit)
I want forever to be you and I
And that's the way it should be, I live for you and baby
That is why I cry just a little bit
(Cry just a little bit)
Cry just a little bit

Every night we have to whisper goodbye
I cry just a little bit
(Cry just a little bit)
I know it's crazy and I don't know why
But I die just a little bit
(Die just a little bit)

Cry, cry, cry just a little bit
Cry just a little bit
Cry, cry, cry just a little bit
Cry just a little bit

Cry, cry, cry just a little bit
Cry just a little bit
Cry, cry, cry just a little bit
Cry just a little bit

Cry, cry, cry just a little bit
Cry just a little bit
Cry, cry, cry just a little bit
Cry just a little bit
