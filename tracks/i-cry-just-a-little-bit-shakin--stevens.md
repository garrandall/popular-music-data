Everytime you have to whisper good-bye

Well
I cry just a little bit
cry just a little bit.
I know it's crazy and I don't know why

But I die just a little bit
die just a little bit.
I need to be the one that's by your side
you are the beat in my heart.
My love for you is something I can't hide

And I cry just a little bit
cry just a little bit

Cry just a little bit
cry just a little bit.
Every night before I'm fallin' asleep

Well
I pray just a little bit
pray just a little bit.
I pray nobody wants your loving to keep
And you stray just a little bit
stray just a little bit.
Don't let temptation fill your heart with dreams

Don't let your mind run away.

Forbidden love is never what it seems

And you cry just a little bit
cry just a little bit
cry just a little bit.
You're the light that brightens all of my days

Yes
the sun shines above you and I would die

If someone took you away
'cause I love you
love you.
Cry just a little bit
cry just a little bit.
I want forever to be you and I
thats's the way it should be.
I live for you and
baby
that is why I cry just a little bit

Cry just a little bit
cry just a little bit.
Every night we have to whisper good-bye

I cry just a little bit
cry just a little bit.
I know it's crazy and I don't know why

But I die just a little bit
die just a little bit.
Cry
cry
cry
cry just a little bit
cry just a little bit

Cry
cry
cry
cry just a little bit
cry just a little bit
. . .
