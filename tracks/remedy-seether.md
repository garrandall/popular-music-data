Throw your dollar bills and leave your thrills all here with me 
And speak but don't pretend I won't defend you anymore you see 
It aches in every bone, I'll die alone, but not for you 
My eyes don't need to see that ugly thing, I know it's me you fear 
If you want me hold me back 

Frail, the skin is dry and pale, the pain will never fail 
And so we go back to the remedy 
Clip the wings that get you high, just leave them where they lie 
And tell yourself, "You'll be the death of me" 

I don't need a friend, I need to mend so far away 
So come sit by the fire and play a while, but you can't stay too long 
It aches in every bone, I'll die alone, but not for pleasure 
I see my heart explode, it's been eroded by the weather here 
If you want me hold me back 

Frail, the skin is dry and pale, the pain will never fail 
And so we go back to the remedy 
Clip the wings that get you high, just leave them where they lie 
And tell yourself, "You'll be the death of me" 
Frail, the skin is dry and pale, the pain will never fail 
And so we go back to the remedy 
Clip the wings that get you high, just leave them where they lie 
And tell yourself, "You'll be the death of me" 

Hold your eyes closed, take me in 
Hold your eyes closed, take me in 

Frail, the skin is dry and pale, the pain will never fail 
And so we go back to the remedy 
Clip the wings that get you high, just leave them where they lie 
And tell yourself, "You'll be the death of me" 
Frail, the skin is dry and pale, the pain will never fail 
And so we go back to the remedy 
Clip the wings that get you high, just leave them where they lie 
And tell yourself, "You'll be the death of me"
