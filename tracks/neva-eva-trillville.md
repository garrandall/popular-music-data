(What, ugh)
Get on my level ho (What!)
Get on my level ho (You can't!)
Get on my level ho (You can't!)
Get on my level ho (What!)
Get on my level ho (It's Trillville ho!)
Get on my level ho (Lil' Scrappy ho!)
Get on my level ho (It's BME ho!)
Get on my level ho (Let's gooo!)




Bitch nigga you can neva eva, eva eva
Eva eva, eva eva eva eva
Get on my level ho (What!)
Get on my level ho (What!)
Get on my level ho (What!)
Get on my level ho (What!)


Get the fuck back, get the fuck up out my way
I ain't playin' nann day
Pussy nigga whatcha say
Meet me anywhere, I don't care it don't matter to me
Cause if ya fuckin' step, I'ma step in yo vicinity
What, you think I'm a ho nigga please you ain't on my level
Get some rank bitch while I'm diggin' ya grave with a shovel
Time after time I ask myself is it really clever
For you to get with me, bitch nigga you can neva eva
You ain't on my level, I'm pushin Chevrolet pedal
If you niggas fuck with me I got that chrome, heavy metal
Never settle for less but always strive for the best
Most these niggas playin chief'll put ya straight to the test




My Benz, looka at my 'Ac
Look at my Navi' and my 'Lac
Get on my level, hell nah neva that
I knew you wasn't real cause all ya do is chit-chat
Always slizzle makin' sho' I stay gone
Call us some broad to the Geor-Georgia Dome
Tryin' to get with me is like naps through a comb
They call me Don P AKA Corlio
Up in the club with my Cartier's on
Don't know if I'm high, drunk, or gettin' my roll on
He on the cell "Can ya hear me" hell nah
Get on my level, that's what I'm tryin' to tell y'all
For real




LA off in this thang, get up on my level ho
Bitch nigga you can neva eva, eva eva hang
Bitch nigga step the fuck back and if ya think I'm jokin'
Aks them niggas that tried to play us, see em' lyin' off in that coffin
Trillville, ATL swangin' swangin' throwin' bows
Got some niggas that be hatin' bustin' slugs at my foes
If ya thinkin' you can fuck with a nigga like me
Nah nigga get rich, Trillville and BME
What the fuck you talkin' about "What you deep" nigga what!
If a hater wanna hate then a hater gettin' bust
We ain't hard to find nigga so why ya steadily talkin' shit
I'm fixin' to sick my dogs ho
Pussy nigga, get big nigga ho


Get crunk out ya brains when I spit this verse
I'm a blood suckin' vampire, my venom is worse
Head bustas deal with dangerous thirsts
Shatter ya bones in ya chest and make ya motherfuckin' heart burst
Don't worry now, prince of the South on the map
Knock yo thoughts out and leave yo brains on ya lap
Don't touch my Kango shorty, what's wrong with you
I might cock my fist back and knock yo grill through




Run around the motherfuckin' club
