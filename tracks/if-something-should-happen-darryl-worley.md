Buddy you and I go way back 
Camp Lejeune, all through high school, and before that.
So I don't mind tellin you I'm scared to death. 
The doctor is goin in on the 25th 
It's the same thing my daddy had 
Thank God they caught it fast. 

But if something should happen 
Stop in some time and say hello to Catherine 
You and Marianne could always keep her laughing 
Because shes gonna need a lot of that 
Take her out to a movie 
It's gonna take sometime before shes back on her feet. 
I know you think I'll be fine and I'm talkin crazy 
But theres always that chance 
That's why I'm askin 
If something should happen 

Little Nathan is growing up so fast 
This November he'll turn 10 
He wants to play quarterback. 
I'm supposed to coach his team this fall 
But I may not get to afterall 
He's gonna need someone to catch a pass 
And to throw it back 

If something should happen 
Oh promise me you'll take that boy out campin 
Throw a line out in the water every now and then 
Answer any questions that he has 
Maybe once he gets older 
You can sit and have that first cold beer together 
And tell him a couple stories on his father 
He's always known your my best friend. 
That's why I'm askin 
If something should happen 

I hope I live until I'm 80 
And I get to see my son get married 
And have babies 
And make a million more memories with my wife. 
Yeah buddy I pray alright 
But if it's my time to leave 
Could you watch over them for me? 

If something should happen
