Pick up my telephone
Then I hear the dial tone
Punch in your numbers
And then it starts to ring
'Hello'? says a voice on the other line. I took a deep breath...
Showtime
Dollar sign, pumpkin pie, please hand me some of those fries
Too short, too tall, too fat, too small
Girls are mean, make me scream, then I read my magazine
Just a teen, cause a scene
She thinks shes a royal queen
I know that you know how, I feel right now
It's not easy, babe believe me
I know that you know how, I feel right now.
Someday I'll loose all this doubt... somehow
Barbie doll, shopping mall, man shes just a know it all
Too short, too tall, too fat, too small
Makes me mad, makes me sad, wanna cry, but that's too bad
Twilight zone, all alone, scream into my microphone
I know that you know how, I feel right now...
Its not easy, babe believe me
I know that you know how, I feel right now.
Someday I'll loose all this doubt... somehow
Mirror mirror with disgrace
Make me wanna hide my face
Make me wanna disappear
Tell me what I wanna hear
Now that its so loud and clear
Running far away but I know that I'll get there someday cause, I'm just another girl
Tryin' to find my place
Hey I know how you feel right now
Its not easy, you'll believe me. 
Hey I know how you feel right now
Someday you will loose all this doubt
Sooner or later youâll lose all this doubt... somehow
