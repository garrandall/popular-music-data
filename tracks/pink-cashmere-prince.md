(La Musica De Harry Fraud)

Yeah, Irv (huh?)
Put a thousand on the grey dog (Which one, over there?)
I like that one (Alright)

Yo, the long trench wearer, money in my hand, I dare ya
To come and take this, find you in a basement naked
Plus it's rainin'
She took a sniff, now she dancin' like she Usher Raymond
See me swerving in the Lincoln with the Daytons
Seat colors Sanaa Lathan, kinda resembles fried bacon
I shoot at your crew, put the spoon inside the Tiramisu
As I sat there looking cute in a suit
Shit I made it cool
To be yourself again without nobody helpin' em
What is that velvet?
Yes it is baby, I'm a specialist
All these fuckin' demons that infest the kid
This be that shit that your grandfather's invested in
Dad's back, your new shit I had that
My new bitch is half black, Bimmer made the hatchback
I'm havin' flashbacks of razors in the ass crack
Hundred thousand dollars all in ones inside the trash bag
A bunch of fiends, I'm havin' lunch in Queens
A lot of hundreds in my Dungarees
I'm at the garden sittin' Indian style, that means I'm on the floor
My skin is shinin' like it's Armor All
Freak bitches like a carnival
Bitch I stay on the boat just like a barnacle
I don't talk to no sons so bring your father through
And I was born in December, paint the Impala blue
Bitch it's gettin' cold, huh

She sniff blow, did the heel toe
Off the wheel of the de Ville, then I peel slow
For real though, I'm trying to get Shaquille dough
Huh, I'm just trying to get Shaquille dough

Hang out the window of my sports car I'm listenin' to Prince
Bitch from Berlin is blowin' me behind the tints
Doves cried, then I let my nut fly in a sluts eye
Eyes still in the mirror lookin' for one time
When we were younger used to play in parks
Now my hunger got me drivin' European sharks
Lay in lofts, paint the hall a light Chilean moss
Shit I stay on the porch, lightin' a torch up like headlights on the Porsche
Tan coupin', work tanner than Cam Newton
Hand crafted Lands snoozin'
Susan, boufin' balloons in, shorty from Oahaxa
Husband back in MÃ©xico, cross this out his lock
Check came in it was $3500 just on the stomach
Imagine what we spent on weapons
And I have our bitch draped up in leopard
Joints filled up with pepper
I'm straight from Queens mother fucker, what you reppin'

She sniff blow, did the heel toe
Off the wheel of the de Ville, then I peel slow
For real though, I'm trying to get Shaquille dough
Huh, I'm just trying to get Shaquille dough

My bitch gallop like a tan deer
Stealin' outfits? from the Tangiers
I been a man here so many damn years
You see that plane, it lands here
You see that drop, that's to drive me away, I'm wearin' cashmere
Pink champagne spillin' down the glass again
I swear just one more score baby we cashin' in
Me and money got a good rapport
I shot the cuban whore, papi met his maker in the humidor
Dove off the boat with the briefcase, no police chase
Then I went and had a cheesesteak from Ishkabibbles
Hit the sizzle, control the whip with one arm like Richard Kimble
Bitch I've been the symbol
Bitch I've been the symbol
Bitch I've been the symbol
Bitch I've been the symbol
Bitch I've been the symbol

She sniff blow, did the heel toe
Off the wheel of the de Ville, then I peel slow
For real though, I'm trying to get Shaquille dough
Huh, I'm just trying to get Shaquille dough
