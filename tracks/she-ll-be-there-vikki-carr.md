He will walk into the room
And look at me
And I'll melt away

He will smile his little smile
And he will see
How I melt away

But all the while
She'll be there
And I can't get
Him to forget her

She'll be there
And I can't get
Him to forget her
The love he lost long ago

He will take me in his arms
And in his arms
I will melt away

He will press his lips to mine
Let him be mine
I will softly pray

And all the while
She'll be there
And I can't get
Him to forget her

She'll be there
And I can't get
Him to forget her
The love he once used to know

Why couldn't I have
Been first in his life
How happy we two could be

Why must there be
Such a thirst in his life
For a memory instead of me

But I love him
Oh, so much, so very much
I can't let him go

So I'll take the love he gives
What love he gives
But I'll always know

Deep in his heart
She'll be there
And I can't get
Him to forget her

She'll be there
And he never will forget her
She'll be there
And I can't get
Him to forget her
