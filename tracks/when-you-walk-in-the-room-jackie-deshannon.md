I could feel a new expression on my face
I could feel a glowin' sensation takin' place
I can hear the guitars playin' lovely tune
Every time that you walk in the room

I close my eyes for a second and pretend it's me you want
Meanwhile I try to act so nonchalant
I feel a summer's night with a magic moon
Every time that you walk in the room

Maybe it's a dream come true
Standin' right alongside of you
Wish I could tell you how much I care
But I only have the nerve to stare

I can feel a somethin' poundin' in my brain
Just anytime that someone speaks your name
Trumpets sound, I hear thunder boom
Every time that you walk in the room

Every time that you walk in the room
Every time that you walk in the room
Every time that you walk in the room
Every time that you walk in the room
Every time that you
