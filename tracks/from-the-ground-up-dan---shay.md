Grandma and grandpa painted a picture
Of 65 years in one little house
More than a memory, more than saying "I do"
Kiss you goodnights and "I love you's"

Me and you, baby, walk in the footsteps
Build our own family
One day at a time
Ten little toes, a painted pink room
Our beautiful baby looks just like you

And we'll build this love from the ground up
Now 'til forever it's all of me, all of you
Just take my hand
And I'll be the man your dad hoped that I'd be

And we'll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I'll stand through the good and the bad
We'll give all that we have
And we'll build this love from the ground up

This life will go by
In the blink of an eye
But I wouldn't wanna spend it without you by my side
The clouds are gonna roll
The earth's gonna shake
But I'll be your shelter through the wind and the rain

And we'll build this love from the ground up
Now 'til forever it's all of me, all of you
Just take my hand
And I'll be the man your dad hoped that I'd be

And we'll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I'll stand through the good and the bad
We'll give all that we have
And we'll build this love from the ground up

Someday we'll wake up with thousands of pictures
Of 65 years in this little house
I won't trade for nothing the life that we built
I'll kiss you goodnight and say, "I love you still"

And we'll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I'll stand through the good and the bad
We'll give all that we have
And we'll build this love from the ground up
From the ground up
