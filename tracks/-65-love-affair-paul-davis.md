I was a car hop
You were into be-bop
You sang, do wop diddy wop diddy wop doo
All of them changes you put me through

If I could go back again
Well, I know I'd never let you go
Back with all of my friends
To that wonderful

'65 Love Affair
We wasn't gettin' nowhere
But we didn't care
It was a crazy
'65 Love Affair
Rock 'n' roll was simple and clear
Oh, I still can hear I can hear it baby

Well I acted like a dum-dum
You were bad with your pom-poms
You said, ohwah go team, oohah go
Ohee baby, I want you to know

If I could go back in time
Well, I know somehow you'd still be mine
I wouldn't be so blind
To that wonderful

'65 Love Affair
When rock 'n' roll was simple and clear
Oh, I still can hear
I can hear it baby

Well, I tried to make you give in
One night at the drive-in
You said oh no baby, oh no woo
All of them changes you put me through

If I could go back in time
Well, I know somehow you'd still be mine
I wouldn't be so blind
To that wonderful

'65 Love Affair
We wasn't gettin' nowhere
But we didn't care
It was a crazy
'65 Love Affair
Rock 'n' roll was simple and clear
Oh, I still can hear I can hear it baby

We sang, doo wop diddy wop diddy wop doo
Doo wop diddy wop diddy wop doo...

If I could go back again
Well I know our love would never end
Back with all of my friends
To that wonderful '65 love affair...
