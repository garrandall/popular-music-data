In the heat of the night
Seems like a cold sweat
Creeping cross my brow, oh yes
In the heat of the night
I'm a feelin' motherless somehow
Stars with evil eyes stare from the sky
(In the heat of the night)
Ain't a woman here before
Knows how to make the morning come
So hard to keep control
Well I could sell my soul for just a little light
In the heat of the night
I've got trouble wall to wall
Oh yes I have
I repeat in the night
Must be an ending to us all
Oh Lord, it won't be long
Yes, just you be strong
And it'll be all right
In the heat of the night
