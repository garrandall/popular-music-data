Well I was dancin'
With my baby
To the Tenne Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend
I happened I happened to see

I introduced him
To my baby
And while and while they were a-dancin'
My friend stole my baby from me

Well I remember remember that night
And that Tennessee Waltz
Well only you know just how much how much I've lost

Well, I lost her, I lost my baby
The night the night that they were playin'
That beautiful Tennessee Waltz



Well I remember remember that night
And that Tennessee Waltz
Well only you know, just how much how much I've lost

Well I lost I lost my baby
The night, the night that they were playin'
That beautiful Tennessee Waltz
Hm, hm, hm, Tennessee Waltz
Hm, hm, hm, Tennessee Waltz
