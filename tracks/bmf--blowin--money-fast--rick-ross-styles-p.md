I think I'm Big Meech, Larry Hoover
Whippin' work, hallelujah
One nation, under God
Real niggas gettin' money from the fuckin' start
I think I'm Big Meech, Larry Hoover
Gettin' work, hallelujah
One nation, under God
Real niggas gettin' money from the fuckin' start


My Rolls Royce triple black, I'm geechee ho
Ballin' in the club, bottles like I'm Meech ho
Rozay, that's my nickname
Cocaine runnin' in my big vein
Self made, you just affiliated
I build it ground up, you bought it renovated
Talkin' plenty capers nothin's been authenticated
Funny you claimin' the same bitch that I'm penetratin'
Hold the bottles up, where my comrades?
Where the fuckin' felons? Where my dogs at?
I got that Archie Bunker
And it's so white, I just might charge you double


I think I'm Big Meech, Larry Hoover
Whippin' work, hallelujah
One nation, under God
Real niggas gettin' money from the fuckin' start
I think I'm Big Meech, Larry Hoover
Gettin' work, hallelujah
One nation, under God
Real niggas gettin' money from the fuckin' start


These mutherfuckers mad that I'm icy
Stunt so hard make them come indict me
I think I'm Big Meech, look at my timepiece
It's another mere, hundred racks at least
Look at yourself, now look at me
You can't see a nigga, I'm what you used to be
Look at it this way, you niggas sideways
Always gettin' money, my nigga, crime pays
So fuck a nigga, I'm self-made
You a sucker nigga, I'm self-paid
This for my broke niggas, this for my rich niggas
Got a hundred on a head of a snitch nigga


I think I'm Big Meech, Larry Hoover
Whippin' work, hallelujah
One nation, under God
Real niggas gettin' money from the fuckin' start
I think I'm Big Meech, Larry Hoover
Gettin' work, hallelujah
One nation, under God
Real niggas gettin' money from the fuckin' start


The thirty-six holes leave you bleedin', fam
Word to them thirty-six O's in a kilogram
Blunt tip, orange like caviar
Wildin' out, fishtailin', Subaru rally car
Out the passenger, lettin' the automatty off
A egg of that girl I'll knock ya mommy and ya daddy off
Fuck around and knock the emblem on the Caddy off
Four shooters buggin' out, blickin' at ya Caddy doors
And did I mention guns from Red Dead Redemption?
Nine mils, fifty clip extensions
Coke is like a mattress in the hood, I'm flippin' on it
And the money's like a chair, I'm sittin' on it


I think I'm Big Meech, Larry Hoover
Whippin' work, hallelujah
One nation, under God
Real niggas gettin' money from the fuckin' start
I think I'm Big Meech, Larry Hoover
Gettin' work, hallelujah
One nation, under God
Real niggas gettin' money from the fuckin' start
