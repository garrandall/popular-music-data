Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired


Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
You're the key to my peace of mind


'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
Woman...


When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know what was wrong with me
'Til your kiss helped me name it


Now I'm no longer doubtful
To what I'm livin' for
And if I make you happy
I don't need to do more


'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
Woman...


Oh baby, what you've done to me
(Done to me)
You make me feel so good inside
(Good inside)
And I just wanna be
(Wanna be)
Close to you, you make me feel so alive


'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman


You make me feel (You make me feel)
You make me feel (Feel like a real)
You make me feel like a real
You make me feel (You make me feel)
You make me feel (Feel like a real)
You make me feel like a real
(You make me feel, you make me feel)
