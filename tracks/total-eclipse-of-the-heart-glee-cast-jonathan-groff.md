Turn around


Every now and then I get a little bit lonely
And you're never coming round


Turn around


Every now and then I get a little bit tired
Of listening to the sound of my tears


Turn around


Every now and then I get a little bit nervous
That the best of all the years have gone by
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified
And then I see the look in your eyes


Turn around bright eyes


Every now and then I fall apart


Turn around bright eyes


Every now and then I fall apart


And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
Cause we'll never be wrong

Together we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
(New Directions: All of the time)
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
(with New Directions: I really need you tonight)
Forever's gonna start tonight
(New Directions: Forever's gonna start tonight)


Once upon a time I was falling in love
Now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
Total eclipse of the heart
Once upon a time there was light in my life


Now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
Total eclipse of the heart


Turn around bright eyes


Every now and then I fall apart


Turn around bright eyes


Every now and then I fall apart


And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
Cause we'll never be wrong

Together we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
(New Directions: All of the time)
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks

I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
(New Directions: Forever's gonna start tonight)


Once upon a time I was falling in love


Now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
Total eclipse of the heart
Total eclipse of the heart


A total eclipse of the heart


Turn around bright eyes
