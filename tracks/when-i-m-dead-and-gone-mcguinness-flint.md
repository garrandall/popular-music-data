Oh, I love you, baby
I love you night and day
When I leave you, baby
Don't cry the night away

When I die
Don't you write no words upon my tomb
I don't believe
I want to leave no epitaph of doom

Ohohoho, when I'm dead and gone
I want to leave some happy woman living on
Ohohoho, when I'm dead and gone
I don't want nobody to mourn beside my grave

Old Mama Linda
She's out to get my hide
She's got a shotgun
And her daughter by her side

Hey, there, ladies
John son's free
Who's got the love, who's got enough
To keep a man like me

Ohohoho, when I'm dead and gone
I want to leave some happy woman living on
Ohohoho, when I'm dead and gone
I don't want nobody to mourn beside my grave

Ohohoho, when I'm dead and gone
I don't want nobody to mourn beside my grave
Ohohoho, when I'm dead, when I'm dead and gone
(Don't want nobody) I don't want nobody to mourn

Ohoho, oooh, lalala, oooh
Oooh, lalala
Oooh, lalala, hey
Oooh, lalala

Ohoho, oooh, lalala, oooh
Oooh, lalala
Oooh, lalala
Oooh, lalala
