I got room in my fumes
He fill my mind up with ideas
I'm the highest in the room
Hope I make it outta here

He saw my eyes, he know I'm gone
I see some things that you might fear
I'm doin' a show, I'll be back soon
That ain't what he wanna hear
Now I got him in my room
Legs wrapped around his beard
Got the fastest car, it zoom
Hope we make it outta here
When I'm with you, I feel alive
You say you love me, don't you lie
Won't cross my heart, don't wanna die
Keep the pistol on my side

Case it's fumes
He fill my mind up with ideas
I'm the highest in the room
Hope I make it outta here

We ain't stressin' 'bout the loot
My block made of queserÃ­a
This not the molly, it's the boot
Ain't no comin' back from here
Live the life of La Familia
It's so much gang that I can't see ya
Turn it up 'til they can't hear
Runnin', runnin' 'round for the thrill
Yeah, dawg, dawg, 'round my real
Raw, raw, I been pourin' to the real
Nah, nah, nah, they not back of the VIP
Gorgeous, baby, keep me hard as steel
Ah, this my life, I did not choose
Uh, been on this since we was kids
We gon' stay on top and break the rules
I fill my mind up with ideas

Case it's fumes
He fill my mind up with ideas
I'm the highest in the room
Hope I make it outta here

I'm the highest in the room
I'm the highest in the room
I'm the highest in the room
