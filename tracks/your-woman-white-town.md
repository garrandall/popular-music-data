Just tell me what you've got to say to me
I've been waiting for so long to hear the truth
It comes as no surprise at all you see
So cut the crap and tell me that we're through
Now I know your heart, I know your mind
You don't even know you're being unkind
So much for all your highbrow Marxist ways
Just use me up and then you walk away
Boy, you can't play me that way


Well I guess what you say is true
I could never be the right kind of girl for you


I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman


When I saw my best friend yesterday
She said she never liked you from the start
Well me, I wish that I could claim the same
But you always knew you held my heart
And you're such a charming, handsome man
Now I think I finally understand
Is it in your genes
I don't know
But I'll soon find out, that's for sure
Why did you play me this way


Well I guess what you say is true
I could never be the right kind of girl for you


I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman


Well I guess what they say is true
I could never spend my life with a man like you


I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
