I was on the outskirts of a little southern town
Trying to reach my destination before the sun went down
The old CB was blaring away on Channel 1-9
When there came a little boy's voice on the radio line


And he said, "Breaker 1-9, is anyone there?
Come on back truckers and talk to Teddy Bear"
Well I keyed the mic and I said, "You got it, Teddy Bear"
And the little boy's voice came back on the air


"Appreciate the break who we got on that end"
I told him my handle and then he began
"Though I'm not supposed to bother you fellows out there
Mom says you're busy and for me to stay off the air"
But you see, I get lonely and it helps to talk
'Cause that's about all I can do, I'm crippled and I can't walk
I came back and told him to fire up that mic
And I'd talk to him as long as he'd liked


"This was my dad's radio", the little boy said
But I guess it's mine and mom's now 'cause my daddy's dead
Dad had a wreck about a month ago
He was trying to get home in a blinding snow
Mom has to work now to make ends meet
And I'm not much help with my two crippled feet
She says not to worry that we'll make it alright
But I hear her crying sometimes late at night
You know there's one thing I want more than anything else to see
Oh, I know you guys are too busy to bother with me
But you see, my dad used to take me for rides when he was home
But I guess that's all over now since my daddy's gone


Not one breaker came on the old CB
As that little crippled boy talked with me
I tried hard to swallow a lump just wouldn't stay down
As I thought about my boy back in Greenville town


Dad was gonna take mom and me with him later on this year
Why I remember him saying someday
This old truck will be yours, Teddy Bear
But I know now I'll never get a ride an 18-wheeler again
But this old base'll keep me in touch with all my trucker friends
Teddy Bear's gonna back on out now and leave you alone
'Cause it's about time for mom to come home
But you give me shout when you're passing through
And I'll surely be happy to come back to you


Well, I came back and I said before you go 10-10
What's your home 20, little CB friend
He gave me his address and I didn't once hesitate
'Cause this hot load of freight would just have to wait
I turned that truck around on a dime
And headed straight for Jackson Street, 229
And as I rounded the corner, oh, I got one heck of a shock
18-wheeler's were lined up for three city blocks
Well I guess every driver for miles around had caught Teddy Bear's call
And that little crippled boy was having a ball
For as fast as one driver would carry him in
Another would carry him to his truck and take off again


Well, you better believe I took my turn at riding Teddy Bear
And then carried him back in and put him down in his chair
And buddy, if I never live to see happiness again
I want you to know I saw it that day in the face of that little man


We took up a collection for him before his mama got home
And each driver said goodbye and then they were all gone
He shook my hand with a mile long grin
And said, "So long trucker, I'll catch you again"
Ah, I hit that interstate with tears in my eyes
I turned on the radio and I got another surprise
"Breaker 1-9", came the voice on the air
"Just one word of thanks from mama, Teddy Bear
We wish each and everyone a special prayer for you
'Cause you just made my little boy's dream come true
I'll sign off now before I start to cry
May God ride with you, 10-4, and goodbye"
