This man's a child, this man is old
Sometimes he's mild, sometimes he's bold
This man I love, sometimes in spite
I wish he would stick to his guns, or abandon the fight

But when he shines, oh when he shines
Yes when he shines, he shines so bright

Sometimes a tramp, sometimes a dude
He changes colour just like a cameleon, can't find the mood
He is a song that's not easy to write
He is a moon in the morning, and the sun out at night

But when he shines, when he shines, oh when he shines, he shines so bright

This man's a gentleman, this man is strong
This temperamental man plays me along

But when he shines, when he shines, oh when he shines, he shines so bright
Yes when he shines, when he shines, oh when he shines, he shines so bright

But when he shines, oh when he shines
Yes when he shines, he shines so bright
