In the winter
My heart grows lonely
I needed someone to love me only

I thought of you
And called you on the phone
Now you're my only one
Don't have to be alone

You gave me love
In January, in February
So love full bloom
In March and April
And the way to June


You're my spring love
No one makes me feel like you do, oh
Spring love
Spring love
There'll be no one after you


'Cause every morning
I hold my pillow
And sing a song of love
It's you I'm dreaming of

Because of you
And all the joy you bring
Every day feels just like spring

You warm my heart
In January and February
New love has grown
It looks like springtime
From now on




Spring love
You're on my mind
You bring love to me all the time
Don't make me wait for paradise

Just you and I
Would be so nice
I love you
Just you and I
Would be so nice

Oh, baby, can we go out to the park
Or maybe to the boardwalk after dark
We sit and watch the stars like lovers do
I love you



You'll always stay on my mind
I think of you at springtime
You'll always stay on my mind
I think of you at springtime

It's gonna be you loving me
That's the way it has to be
(My spring love, my spring love)
It's gonna be you loving me
That's the way it has to be
(My spring love, my spring love, oh)

It's gonna be you loving me
That's the way it has to be
(My spring love, my spring love, oh)
It's gonna be you loving me
That's the way it has to be
(My spring love, my spring love, oh)
