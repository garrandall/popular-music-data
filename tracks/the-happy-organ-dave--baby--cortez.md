The best things in life are free, but you can give them to the birds and bees
I need money
That's what I want
(That's what I want. That's what I want.)
That's what I want, that 's what I want
(That's what I want. That's what I want.)

Your love gives me such a thrill, but your love don't pay my bills
I need money
That's what I want
(That's what I want. That's what I want.)
That's what I want, that 's what I want
(That's what I want. That's what I want.)

Money don't get ev'rything, it's true, but what it don't get I can't use
I need money
That's what I want
(That's what I want. That's what I want.)
That's what I want, that 's what I want
(That's what I want. That's what I want.)

Money, lots of money
(That's what I want, uh huh.)
Whole lot of money
(That's what I want, uh huh.)
Uh huh. Ah, ah, oh, yeah
(That's what I want, uh huh. That's what I want.)
(That's what I want, uh huh. That's what I want.)

Money, lots of money
(That's what I want, uh huh.)
Whole lot of money
(That's what I want, uh huh.)
Uh huh. Ah, ah, oh, yeah
(That's what I want, uh huh. That's what I want.)
