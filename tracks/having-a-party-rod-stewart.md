Yeah, clap your hands

We're having a party,
dancing to the music
played by the D.J.
on the radio
The Cokes are in the icebox,
popcorn's on the table
Me and my baby, yeah,
we're out here on the floor, oh yeah

So, Mister, Mr. D.J.
keep those records playing
coz I'm having
such a good time,
dancing with my baby

Everybody's swinging,
Sally's doing that twist now
If you playrequests now,
I've got a few for you
Play that one called "Soul Twist".
Play that one called "I Know"
Don't forget them "Mashed Potatoe"
no other songs will do

So, Mister, Mr. D.J.
keep those records playing
coz I'm having
such a good time,
dancing with my baby

Having a party

So, Mister, Mr. D.J.
keep those records playing
coz I'm having
such a good time,

Having a party
Everybody's swinging

We're having a party
Everybody's swinging

We're having a party
Everybody's swinging

We're having a party
Everybody's swinging

We're having a party
Everybody's swinging
