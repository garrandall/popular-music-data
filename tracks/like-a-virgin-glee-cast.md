I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
I didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you

I was beat incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
Shiny and new

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine

Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you
'Cause only love can last

You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah you make me bold
Oh your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out
What was getting cold

Like a virgin (hey)
Touched for the very first time (yeah yeah)
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine

Oh (whoah)
oh(whoah whoah)
ohyah yeah yeah)
(whoah whoah)

You're so fine and you're mine
I'll be yours 'till the end of time
'Cause you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
I've nothing to hide

Like a virgin , hey
(you make me feel like a virgin)
Touched for the very first time
(Ohhh baby)
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine

Like a virgin, oh, oh
Like a virgin (yeahh)
Feels so good inside
When you hold me (when you hold me)
When your heart beats (when your heart beats)
When you love me (when you love me baby)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (yeah)
Oh baby
oh
Like a virgin
