I gave my love, I gave my life, I gave my body and mind
We were inseparable
I guess I gave you all of my time
And now you plead insanity and you don't even know the score
Why can't you learn to play the game?
Baby, don't you know that you need me more? (More, more, more)


You need another lover like you need a hole in your head (baby, baby)
You know there ain't no other
That can do the duty in your bed, yeah


We were brothers and sisters
United all for love
Now all of the sudden (all of the sudden)
You try to fight it (try to fight it)
You say you've had enough (say you've had enough)
Even though we had big fun (even though we had big fun)
You want another someone (You want another someone)
Your happily ever after be (Sure as there's a sun)
Sure as there's a sun, (I'm going to be the one)
I'm going to be the one and if (you don't understand)
You don't understand face to face (face to face)
Baby I'll tell you down on my knee, yeah


You need another lover like you need a hole in your head (baby, baby)
You know there ain't no other
That can do the duty in your bed, yeah
You need another lover like you need a hole in your head (baby, baby)
You know there ain't no other
That can do the duty in your bed, yeah
You need another lover like you need a hole in your head (baby, baby)
You know there ain't no other
That can do the duty in your bed, yeah


There's going to be a riot, if you don't clap your hands
If you don't make that funky stand, everybody
You know there ain't no other
