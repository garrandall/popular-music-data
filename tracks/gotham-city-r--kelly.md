I'm looking over the skyline of the city
How loud, quiet nights in the mist of crime
How next door to happiness lives sorrow
And signals of solution in the sky

A city of justice, a city of love
A city of peace, for everyone of us
We all need it, can't live without it
Gotham City, oh, yeah

How sleeping awake because of fear (oh, yeah)
How children are drowning in their tears
How we need a place where we can go
A land where everyone will have a hero (even me)

A city of justice, a city of love
A city of peace, for everyone of us
Cause we all need it, can't live without it
Gotham City, oh, yeah

A city of justice, a city of love
A city of peace, for everyone of us
Cause we all need it, can't live without it
Gotham City, oh, yeah

Yet in the middle of stormy weather
We won't stumble and we won't fall
I know a place that offers shelter

A city of justice, a city of love
A city of peace, for everyone of us
We all need it, can't live without it
Gotham City, oh, yeah

A city of justice, a city of love
A city of peace, for everyone of us
We all need it, can't live without it
Gotham City, oh, yeah

A city of justice, a city of love
A city of peace, for everyone of us
We all need it, can't live without it
Gotham City, oh, yeah

A Gotham City
(Everybody needs Gotham City)
Gotham City
(Don't you want one, oh yeah)
Come on, come on, Gotham City
(Everybody needs Gotham City)
A Gotham City
(Don't you want one, oh yeah)


A Gotham City
A Gotham City
A Gotham City
