I was angry when I met you
I think I'm angry still
We can try to talk it over
If you say you'll help me out


Don't worry, baby
(Don't worry, baby)
No need to fight
Don't worry, baby
(Don't worry, baby)
We'll be all right


This is the noise that keeps me awake
My head explodes, and my body aches


Push it, make the beats go harder
Push it, make the beats go harder


I'm sorry that I hurt you
Please don't ask me why
I want to see you happy
I want to see you shine


Don't worry, baby
(Don't worry, baby)
Don't be uptight
Don't worry, baby
(Don't worry, baby)
We'll stay up all night


This is the noise that keeps me awake
My head explodes, and my body aches


Push it, make the beats go harder
Push it, make the beats go harder


C'mon push it, you can do it
C'mon prove it, nothing to it
C'mon use it, let's get through it
C'mon push it, you can do it


Don't worry, baby
(Don't worry, baby)
Don't be uptight
Don't worry, baby
(Don't worry, baby)
We'll stay up all night


This is the noise that keeps me awake
My head explodes, and my body aches


Push it, make the beats go harder
(This is the noise that keeps me awake)
Push it, make the beats go harder
(My head explodes, and my body aches)
Push it, make the beats go harder
(This is the noise that keeps me awake)
Push it, make the beats go harder
(My head explodes, and my body aches)


Don't worry, baby
We'll be all right
Don't worry, baby
We'll be all right

Push it
Push it
Push it
Push it
Push it
