Do you know how to twist
If you don't, I'll show you how
Do you know how to twist
If you don't, you're out of style
Everybody is twisting now
Everybody is learning how
Put on a tight dress
We're on our way
We'll twist til
The break of day

(CHORUS)
Let's twist (let's twist)
Oh, baby, let's twist (let's twist)
If you resist, look what you miss
Baby, if it's late at night
Or if the sun is shinging bright
The twist is the thing to do
It's good for me and you

(CHORUS)
Do you know how to twist
If you don't, I'll show you how
Do you know how to twist
If you don't, you're out of style
The gang is on the move
They're in a twisting groove
Now that you've got the news
Put on your twisting shoes
Let's twist (let's twist)
Oh, baby, let's twist (let's twist)
If you resist, see what you miss
Do you know how to twist
If you don't, I'll show you how
One more time now
Do you know how to twist
If you don't, you're out of style
Thank you
