Who is gonna love me? Not you
You will be gone
And here I'll stay, all alone and
I'll just waste away
Wondering who is gonna hold me
And keep me warm when I'm cold
Who will I wake up for
Through all those lonely years?
No one to wake up for but
Sleep won't come to end these tears

And who is gonna kiss me if you
Walk out the door?
There'll be no one new: not for me
'Cause my whole life, is you
Darling, if you donâ€™t wanna love me
There's just no use hanging on
For without your love
Everything is wrong

Oh, but sleep won't come to end these tears
And who is gonna kiss me if you
Walk out the door?
There'll be no one new, not for me 'cause
My whole life is you
Darling, if you don't wanna love me
There's just no use in hangin' on
For without your love
Everything is wrong
For me
