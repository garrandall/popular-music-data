You'd like to show me all around
Thank you girl but I know this town
It's alright, hey lawdy mama, it's alright
Don't you know they're all the same
Only difference is the name
It's alright, hey lawdy mama, it's alright
Three motels, dusty cars
A movie show and a dozen bars
It's alright, hey lawdy mama, it's alright
Only thing that I can say
Is we'll be here for just one day

Baby don't you know we're
Leavin' early in the mornin'
So long, I don't know we might be back next year
Baby it just might be never
Don't cha worry 'bout it
So long, good to know your smilin' face was here

This town is boring you to tears
Nothing in the world ever happens here
It's alright, hey lawdy mama, it's alright
Don't you know you've got to help
Nothing ever happens by itself
It's alright, hey lawdy mama, it's alright
If no one will share the load
Go pack your bags, hit the open road
It's alright, hey lawdy mama, it's alright
Try to find someone like you
Hope will tell you what to do

Baby don't you know we're
Leavin' early in the mornin'
So long, I don't know we might be back next year
Baby it just might be never
Don't cha worry 'bout it
So long good to know your smilin' face was here
