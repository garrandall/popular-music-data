My baby knows me better that I do
Funny how a woman has that over a man
I can do anything with her here beside me
Leaning on her is where I make my stand 

And where would we be without the love of a woman 
Standing behind her man even when he's wrong
The true, pure, undying love of a woman 
Makes a man a fool to think he can make it alone

My Daddy was a wild one when he was younger
Everyone told my mamma he'd be hard to tame
Full of himself, said "Sir" to nobody
But you ought to see him come running when mamma calls his name

Where would we be without the love of a woman
Standing behind her man even when he's wrong 
The true, pure, undying love of a woman 
Makes a man a fool to think he can make it alone



A man goes crazy tryin' to catch his feelings
Too much pride or maybe the words come out wrong
But that's okay, 'cause he's still her hero
Steady as a rock, her love keeps holdin' on

Where would we be without the love of a woman
Standing behind her man even when he's wrong 
The true, pure, undying love of a woman 
Makes a man a fool to think he can make it alone
Makes a man a fool to think he can make it alone
