Went to a party the other night
All the ladies were treating me right
Moving my feet to the disco beat
How in the world could I keep my seat

All of a sudden
I began to change
I was on the dance floor acting strange
Flapping my arms
I began to cluck
Look at me
I'm the disco duck


Ah, get down mama
I've got to have me a woman
Ha ha ha ha ha


Disco, disco duck


Got to have me a woman


Disco, disco duck


Oh, get down, mama


Try your luck
Don't be a cluck
Disco

Disco duck

All right


Disco disco duck


Ah, get down, mama
Oh mama, shake your tail feather
Ha ha ha ha ha


When the music stopped
I returned to my seat
But there's no stopping a duck and his beat
So I got back up to try my luck
Why look it's the disco duck!


Everybody's doing the


Disco, disco duck
Disco, disco duck
Try your luck


Wave to me


Don't be a cluck


I'm so happy to be here


Disco


Thank you, duck


Disco


For getting down


Disco disco disco


Thank you so very much


Disco duck


You're welcome


Disco
Disco Duck
Try your luck
Don't be a cluck
Disco, disco, disco
