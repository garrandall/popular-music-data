Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'm not the one you need
You say you're looking for someone
Who's never weak but always strong
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door


But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're looking for, babe


Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'll only let you down
You say you're looking for someone
Who'll promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart
Someone to die for you and more

You say you're looking for someone
To pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call
And will love you for your life
And nothing more
