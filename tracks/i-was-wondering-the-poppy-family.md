I was wondering
If you cried today
For the love that
Died here yesterday
Tears are something
People hide away

I was wondering
If you smiled today
You know people
Used to be that way
Why are all of them
So sad today

I was wondering
If you lived today
Did you have something
Nice to say
Was there something
You could give away

I've been wondering
Why they've never won
A war with hatred
And a gun
Love brings together
Everyone

I've been wondering
What we're going to do
I think it's got to start
Inside of you
It's got to grow and spread
To others too

I was wondering
If you smiled today
Or if you had something
Nice to say
Or did you send out love
In any way
