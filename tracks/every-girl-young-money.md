Tha Biz, The Bizness


Uh, I like a long haired, thick redbone
Open up her legs, then filet mignon that pussy
I'ma get in and on that pussy
If she let me in, I'ma own that pussy
Gon' throw it back and bust it open like you 'posed to
Girl, I got that dope dick, now come here let me dope you
You gon' be a dope fiend, your friends should call you Dopey
Tell 'em keep my name out they mouth if they don't know me
Hah, but you can call me Tunechi
I'll fuck the whole group, baby, I'm a groupie
My sex game is stupid, my head is the dumbest
I promise, I should be hooked on Phonics
Hah, but anyway, I think you're bionic
And I don't think you're beautiful, I think you're beyond it
And I just wanna get behind it and watch you
(Back it up and dump it, ba-back it up and dump it)


Cause we like her, and we like her too
And we like her, and we like her too
And we like her, and we like her too
And we like her, and she like us too, and ohhh
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
Ohhhhh-ohh-ohh


Yeah, alright
She be jumpin' up and down, tryna fit that ass in
Took her half an hour just to get that belt to fasten
All they wanna talk about is partyin' and fashion
Every single night I have a dream that I am smashin' them all
Young Money, man, this shit so timeless
And I'm in the mood to get faded, so please bring your finest
And what are all your names, again? We drunk, remind us
Are any of y'all into girls like I am? Let's be honest
She wants me, she wants me
Cause I got it all, shawty, tell me what you don't see?
I will fuck with all y'all, all of y'all are beautiful
I just can't pick one, so you can never say I'm choosy hoes
And Wayne say, "Pussy, pussy, pussy"
And weed and alcohol seem to satisfy us all, damn
And every time I think of staying with her
She bring that friend around and make a nigga reconsider, man


Cause we like her, and we like her too
And we like her, and we like her too
And we like her, and we like her too
And we like her, and she like us too, and ohhh
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
Ohhhhh-ohh-ohh


I'm calling you sexy, lady
But, um, I ain't being disrespectful, baby, I'm just bein' Millz
And I don't know how fake feels, so I gotta keep it real
I just want to fuck every girl in the world
Every model, every singer, every actress, every diva
Every high saditty chick, every college girl, every skeezer
Stripper and every desperate housewife that resemble Eva
My role model was Wilt, some married women or MILF
It don't matter who you is, miss, you can get the business, ha!


These hoes is God's gift like Christmas
I like 'em caramel skin, long hair, thick ass
Uh, and I swear I'm feelin' all of y'all
I'm scrollin' down my call log and I'ma call all of y'all
My butter pecan Puerto Rican
She screamin' out "papi" every time a nigga deep in
And I'm about to get my Bill Clinton on
And Hilary can Rodham too, boy, I gets my pimpin' on


Cause we like her, and we like her too
And we like her, and we like her too
And we like her, and we like her too
And we like her, and she like us too, and ohhh
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world


And bitch I'm Mack Maine...
Sanna Lathan, Meagan Good
Angelina Jolie, hah, D. Woods
For free suites, I'd give Paris Hilton all-nighters
In about three years, holla at me Miley Cyrus
I don't discriminate, no, not at all
Kit-Kat a midget, if that ass soft, I'll break her off
I exchange V-cards with the retards
And get behind a Christian like Dior cause he are
Mack Mizzle, baby
Cause he are Mack Mizzle, baby


And I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
Young Mula, baby
