Take me now, baby, here as I am
Hold me close, and try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed


Come on now, try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand, as the sun descends
They can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now


Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us


Have I doubt, baby, when I'm alone
Love is a ring, a telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our bed 'til the morning comes


Come on now, try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand, as the sun descends
They can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now


Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us


With love we sleep, with doubt the vicious cycle turns, and burns
Without you oh I cannot live, forgive the yearning Burning
I believe it's time, too real to feel
So take me now, take me now, take me now


Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
And everybody says that it belongs to us
