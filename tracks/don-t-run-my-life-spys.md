You want to shoot me down again
Why, did I steal your crowd?
I never knew you could be so vain

Don't you know
I'm on my feet again
See, it didn't take too long
Time has a funny way of healing

Don't run my life
Don't tell me what to play
Don't run my life
Don't tell me what to say

It was hell living on the outside
But it did me good
So, it's over now, here's your big surprise

Don't run my life
Don't tell me what to play
Don't run my life
Don't tell me what to say
(Don't tell me what to say, yeah)

At Soldiers and Sailors, we all knew
Busted fingers meant for you

A broken hand
I've got a broken heart
It wasn't the pressure
That tore me apart
It was you
Only you

No, you'll never shoot me down again
Looks like the table's turned
Time has a funny way of healing

I'm not sure of what's in store for me
Hope, I'll dream, guess
So for now I wish you well
But not the best

Don't run my life
Don't tell me what to play, yeah
Don't run my life
Don't tell me what to say
Don't run my life
Don't tell me what to play (Tell me what to play)
Don't run my life (Don't run my life)
Don't tell me what to say (Don't-cha tell me what to say)
Don't run my life (Don't run my life, don't run, don't run)
Don't tell me what to play (Don't-cha tell me what to play, oh yeah)
