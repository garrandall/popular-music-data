Get up, get up


Get up
Come on, move your body
Get up
Come on, move your feet now
Get up
Move boy, move boy
Get up
Come on, move that body

It's a Friday night and
The groove is kicking
Where the girls are
Finger licking

I came to the club
Just to cool out
But this girl was
Getting buck wild

I really just wanted to dance
But she's grabbing me
By my pants
Said, you're cause you
Gotta get loose
But I came to cold chill
With the crew

Get up, get up
Get up, get up

Now the place is
Even thumping harder
And this here, she
Needs a dancing partner
So I gave her the sex look
Yeah, and that's all it took

Now's the time to get me to groove
But you see, I don't wanna move
Sex is what I wanna do
So, come hook up and show you



Get up, get up
Get up



Don't stop now

Get up, get up
Get up, get up

Here's the one
That's of life?
But all you wanna do
Is dance all night

She thinks I'm lazy
Maybe crazy
I just wanna get busy
And give you something
You never had before
No need for a dance floor

I just, she just
Where we can swing
I don't wanna move

So I make up another excuse
To prove that it's not about moving
The floor is collapsing
Go ahead, do it

Who knows
You might just get the juice
But, man, oh, man
This is lasting too long
I need to that crazy song
I don't wanna move



Get up, get up
Get up, get up



Get up, get up
Get up, get up
