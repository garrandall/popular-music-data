Hey mama, don't you treat me wrong
Come and love me all night long
Oh oh, hey hey
All right now

See the girl with the diamond ring
She knows how to twist that thing
Oh oh, hey hey
All right now

Tell your mama, tell your pa
I'm gonna ship you back to Arkansas
Oh yes, you don't do right
You don't do right

Tell me what'd I say
Tell me what'd I say right now
Tell me what'd I say
Tell me what'd I say
Tell me what'd I say
Tell me what'd I say

Yes, I wanna know

Baby, I wanna know right now
Yes, I wanna know
Honey, I wanna know
Yes, I wanna know

Hey hey
