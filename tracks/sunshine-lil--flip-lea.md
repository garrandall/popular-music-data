 Uhhhhhhh
 Yeeah
 Ohh, ohh, ohh, oh baby
 Lil' Flipper (Lil' Flipper)
 Ooh baby
 My girl Lea (my girl Lea) hit it


Sunshine
I can call you my baby boy
You can call me your baby girl
Maybe we can spend some time (some time)
I can be your sunshine!
I can call you my baby boy
You can call me your baby girl
Maybe we can spend some time (some time)
I can be your sunshine!


Look, I know you wanna chill wit a player
But all you got to do is keep it real wit a player
Just answer your phone whenever I call
Cause I'm riding on chrome whenever I ball
I like them short and tall but not too thick
I just walk in the spot and take my pick
And they wanna roll cause they like my style
And when I pop my collar I make them smile
I need a lady in the streets but a freak in the sheets
That know how to cook cause a nigga like to eat
Spaghetti, shrimp and steak and I'll adore you
I'll treat you like milk, I'll do nothing but spoil you




I know your friends wanna holla cause I got them dollars
Push the Maybach Monday, tuesday Impala
I switch whips like kicks I'm a balla (I'm a balla)
And if I get your phone number I'm a call ya (I'm a call ya)
And we can meet up the next day and chill
But I'm always on the road baby girl, that's how I live
I got bills to pay, I got moves to make
But when my plane touch down, pick me up at 8:00, don't be late




We don't have to be in love (love)
We can just be friends!
I will be right there, beginning to the end!
I can bring my girls (girls), you can bring your friends (friends)
We can both have fun, don't want this stuff to end!


They say love is pain and pain is love
I know ya Momma mad cause you talk to a thug
You think you know my type but you ain't got no clue
About - what a real real nigga like me do
I like to stack my bread and flip my chips
And I can change ya life if ya get wit Flip
I take private jets to Vegas, man
It's twenty bread each pick cause I'm major man
We can cruise the world in a Bently Azure
But don't worry, the chauffer open the door
You couldn't ask for more cause we got it all (we got it all)
Cause you my baby girl right?, right?




We don't have to be in love (love)
We don't have to be in love (love)
