We were born to be alive
We were born to be alive

Born, born to be alive
(Born to be alive)
Yes we were born
Born
Born
(Born to be alive)

People ask me why
I never find a place to stop
And settle down, down, down
But I never wanted all those things
People need to justify
Their lives, lives, lives

Yes we were born, born
Born to be alive
(Born to be alive)
Yes we were born
Born
Born
(Born to be alive)

It's good to be alive
To be alive
To be alive
It's good to be alive
To be alive
To be alive

It's good to be alive

Time was on my side
When I was running down the street
It was so fine, fine, fine
A suitcase and an old guitar
It's something I need to occupy
A mind like mine

Yes we were born, born
Born to be alive
(Born to be alive)
Yes we were born
Born
Born
(Born to be alive)

Yes we were born, born
Born to be alive
(Born to be alive)
Yes we were born
Born
Born
(Born to be alive)

Yes we were born, born
Born to be alive
(Born to be alive)
Yes we were born
Born
Born
(Born to be alive)

Born
Born to be alive
(Born to be alive)
Yes we were born
Born
Born
(Born to be alive)

Born
Born to be alive
