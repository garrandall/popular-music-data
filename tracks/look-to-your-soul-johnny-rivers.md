Hendricks

I nearly lost myself
Tryin’ to be someone else
All of life I’ve been playing the game

Gotta get out of myself it seems
Life’s not real when you’re in a dream
Hang on to your head and give it a try

To live you must nearly die
Giving up the need to say I
Look to your soul for the answer
Look to your soul

So many people passing by
Have a need to identify
All of us want to be satisfied

Few people seem to care
Livin’ the life that goes nowhere
Nobody takes the time to try

To live you must nearly die
Giving up the need to say I
Look to your soul for the answer
Look to your soul
