I nearly lost myself
Tryinâ to be someone else
All of life Iâve been playing the game.

Gotta get out of myself it seems
Lifeâs not real when youâre in a dream
Hang on to your head and give it a try.

To live you must nearly die
Giving up the need to say I
Look to your soul for the answer
Look to your soul.

So many people passing by
Have a need to identify
All of us want to be satisfied.

Few people seem to care
Livinâ the life that goes nowhere
Nobody takes the time to try.

To live you must nearly die
Giving up the need to say I
Look to your soul for the answer
Look to your soul.
