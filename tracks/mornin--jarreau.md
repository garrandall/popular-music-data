Mornin' Mister Radio
Mornin' little Cheerios
Mornin' sister oriole
Did I tell you everything is fine 
In my mind?

Mornin' Mister Shoeshine man
Shine'em bright in white and tan
Baby said she loves me and
Need I tell you that everything here is just fine
In my mind

'Scuse me if I sing 
My heart has found its wings
Searchin' high and low
And now at last I know

Mornin' Mister Golden Gate
I should walk but I can't wait
I can't wait to set it straight
I was shakin' but now I am makin' it fine 
Here in my mind

My heart will soar
With love that's rare and real
My smiling face will feel every cloud
Then higher still beyond the blue until
I know I can like any man reach out my hand
And touch the face of God

'Scuse me if I sing 
My heart has found its wings
Searchin' high and low
And now at last I know

Mornin' Mister Radio
Mornin' little Cheerios
Mornin' sister oriole
Did I tell you everything is fine
In my mind

So won't you get up, oriole
So won't you get up, Cheerio
Wake up, Mister Radio
 it's fine
Here in my mind

Singin' about mornin' little radio
Mornin' little Cheerios
Wake up, Mister Radio
Need I tell you everything right is just doing fine
Woo, in my mind
