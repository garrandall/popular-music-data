Every night I'm there
I'm always there,she knows I'm there
And heaven knows
I hope she goes
I find it hard
To realize that love was in her eyes
It's dying now
She knows I'm crying now

And every night I'm there
I break my heart to please
Eloise, Eloise

You know I'm on my knees yeah
I said please
You're all I want,so hear my prayer
My prayer

My Eloise is like the stars that please the night
The sun that makes the day
That lights the way
And when that star goes by
I hold it in my hands and cry
Her love was mine
You know my sun will shine

And every night I'm there
I break my heart to please
Eloise, Eloise
You're all I want you gotta hear my prayer
My prayer

My Eloisa
I love to please her
I'd like to care
But she's not there
And when I find you
I'd be so kind
You'd want to stay
I know you'd stay

And as the days grow old
The nights grow cold
I wanna hold her near to me
You know she's dear to me

And only time will tell
And take away this lonely hell
I'm on my knees
To my Eloise

And every night I'm there
I break my heart to please
Eloise, my Eloise

You are my life so hear my prayer
You are the prize
I know you're there, I know you're there
You're all I want you gotta hear my prayer
Yeah yeah yeah
You're all I need
But you're not there
Oh no you're not there
No no no no
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
My Eloisa, oh I gotta please her
My Eloisa
My Eloisa
Oh my Eloisa, come back to me
My Eloisa
