Every night I'm there
I'm always there, she knows I'm there
And heaven knows
I hope she goes

I find it hard to realize
That love was in her eyes
It's dying now
She knows I'm crying now

And every night I'm there
I break my heart to please
Eloise, Eloise

You know I'm on my knees, yeah
I said please
You're all I want, so hear my prayer, my prayer

My Eloise
Is like the stars that please the night
The sun that makes the day
That lights the way

And when that star goes by
I'll hold it in my hands and cry
Her love is mine
My sun will shine

Every night I'm there
I break my heart to please
Eloise, da da, da da da, da de, Eloise

Ah

You're all I want you gotta hear my prayer

My Eloisa
I'd love to please her
I'd love to care
But she's not there

And when I find you
I'd be so kind
You'd want to stay
I know you'd stay

Do dee do de doo
Do dee do de doo doo doo

And as the days grow old
The nights grow cold
I wanna hold, her near to me yeah
I know she's dear to me

And only time can tell
And take away this lonely hell
I'm on my knees
To Eloise

And every night I'm there
I break my heart to please
Eloise, da da, da da da, da de, Eloise

You are my life, so hear my prayer
You are the price, I know you're there
You're all I want, so hear my prayer yeah yeah
You're all I need and I'm not there

You know I'm not there
No, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My Eloisa
I got to please her yeah
She knows I love her, love her, love her, love love love love love her
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
