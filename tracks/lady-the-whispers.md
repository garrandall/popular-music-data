You say you love me lady, girl, I hope you do
Only you can save me, my life equals you
Kiss me, drive me crazy, would you do that for me lady?

(Lady)
You say you want my babies, girl, if that's a fact
(Lady)
Then melt into me lady as though we were wax
Erase all my maybes, would you do that for me lady?

Ohh, your body's designed by the wisdom of time
And I couldn't live without you, I'd be losing my mind, ohh
You're the answer to the prayers and just like fresh air
You keep me alive, you cannot be spared

(Lady)
I love you, oh, I love you, I said I love you lady
(Lady)
And no power on this earth can keep us apart
You're engraved in my heart, do you hear me pretty lady
I want you to hear every word I say

Ohh, your body's designed by the wisdom of time
And I couldn't live without you, I'd be losing my mind, ohh
You're the answer to the prayers and just like fresh air
You keep me alive, you cannot be spared

Don't you ever go nowhere
(Lady)
You see I love you lady, really, really love you girl
(Lady)
And no power, no power, baby, keep us apart
You're engraved in my heart, do you hear me pretty lady

Do you hear me baby
(Lady)
I want you to hear every word I say, yeah, girl
(Lady)
That means I love you baby
And that means that I want you baby

(Lady)
(Lady)
And that means that I'm gon' get you baby
Well, well, well, well, well, well, don't you know that I love you girl
You kiss me and drive me crazy, yes, you do girl

(Lady)
Kiss me, love me, squeeze me, love me, do anything that you wanna do
(Lady)
But don't you ever, ever, ever, ever go nowhere
Please I don't want you to go nowhere baby
You see I love you girl, can't you see that I'm saying
