I like to move at the speed of light 
Albert says I can't -- but I can 
Circle of stone, circle of steel 
I want to ride in an iron wheel 

I am a child of atomic war 
You are the daughter of the overlord 
Let's get together on the killin' floor 
Give me -- more, more, more, more, more 

Violet lightning 
Violet lightning 

She's the girl with the hungry eyes 
The girl with the hungry eyes 
She holds up half the sky 
The girl with the hungry eyes 

I just met the girl with the perfect lips 
I just met the girl with the perfect fit 
Every atom in my body could inhale her 
Speed of light girl, she is a sailor 

Violet lightning 
Violent lightning 
Violet lightning 

Now we're movin' at the speed of light 
Now we're movin' at the speed of night 
And your home gets filled with newer people, people, people 
And all your friends are gone so hang on, hang on to the 

Girl with the hungry eyes 
She hold up half the sky -- she's the 
Girl with the hungry eyes -- I love the 
Girl with the hungry eyes
