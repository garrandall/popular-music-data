It's you, it's always you
If I'm ever gonna fall in love, I know it's gon' be you
It's you, it's always you
Met a lot of people, but nobody feels like you
So please don't break my heart, don't tear me apart
I know how it starts, trust me, I've been broken before
Don't break me again, I am delicate
Please don't break my heart, trust me, I've been broken before


I've been broken, yeah, I know how it feels
To be open and then find out your love isn't real
I'm still hurting, yeah, I'm hurting inside
I'm so scared to fall in love, but if it's you, then I'll try


It's you, it's always you
If I'm ever gonna fall in love, I know it's gon' be you
It's you, it's always you
Met a lot of people, but nobody feels like you
So please don't break my heart, don't tear me apart
I know how it starts, trust me, I've been broken before
Don't break me again, I am delicate
Please don't break my heart, trust me, I've been broken before


I know I'm not the best at choosing lovers (Oh)
We both know my past speaks for itself (For itself)
If you don't think that we're right for each other (Baby, no)
Then please don't let history repeat itself
'Cause I want you, yeah, I want you, yeah
There's nothing else I want
'Cause I want you, yeah, I want you, yeah
And you're the only thing I want


It's you, it's always you
If I'm ever gonna fall in love, I know it's gon' be you
It's you, it's always you
Met a lot of people, but nobody feels like you
So please don't break my heart, don't tear me apart
I know how it starts, trust me, I've been broken before
Don't break me again, I am delicate
Please don't break my heart, trust me, I've been broken before


Baby, I want you, baby, I want you
Baby, I want you, baby, I want you
Baby, I want you, baby, I want you
You, you, 'cause I want you
Baby, I want you, baby, I want you
Baby, I want you, baby, I want you
Baby, I want you, baby, I want you
You, you
