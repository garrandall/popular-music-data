Boooom!
Yeah di world mash up!
From Vicious do da chune ya man, people holla
Girls dem bruk out and shock out fi da one ya


A one new girl weh Vicious find again
Live up the street, when you go right round di bend
Nika is her name and not, Nicka
I woulda marry the girl if she cripple
Inna di park, we a ride we bicycle
And then we go, gwan go buy icicle
I wonder why my parents love her soooooo?
I want you fi know!


Me find me heart beat again
Brand new girl a weh mi have a mad dem, a she a murda dem
Me find me heart beat again
Brand new girl a weh mi have a mad dem


Vicious bawl out zoop, (zoop)
Send me and fly down di gully
From the first girl weh have me up when she did lef' me
But now me find Nika and Nika have pity
Hug up di girl and then we get two baby
I love the girl, I love the girl very badly
Although sometimes the girl, she tries fi play me
But if you ever leave me Vicious would go crazy
Oh God Nika, Vicious love you badly


Cause when me inna di party a kick di Ragamuffin flow
I make the ladies say, (ah!)
Brothers say, (Oh!)
My name is Little Vicious and I'll rip up ya show, bow, bow!
(Ladies say, ah!
Brothers say, Oh!)

Vicious bawl out out, bruum
Mek me call Nika pon the phone
I said to Nika, "tonight me have a show
I just called to see if you waan go"
You know she say, "yes", and she never say, "no"
I said, "I'll pick you up 8 or so"
Me pick her up 9 and me said, "lets go."
Go a di show and collect fi mi dough
After the show I'm calling, a dat me know!
