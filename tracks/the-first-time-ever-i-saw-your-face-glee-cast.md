The first time, ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes


And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave


To the dark, and the endless skies, my Love.


The first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hand


Like the trembling heart of a captive bird


That was there at my command, my love


And the first time, ever I lay with you
I felt your heart so close to mine


And I knew our joy, would fill the earth


And last, til the end of time, my Love.


The first time, ever I saw


Your face

Your face

Your face

Your face
