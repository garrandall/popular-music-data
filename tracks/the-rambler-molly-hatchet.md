I'm going down to the river,
Just to bide my time away,
Don't you look for me tommorrow,
Cause I won't be back this way,
Oh girl I hate to leave you,
But I just can't seem to stay,
When I see the sunrise in your eyes,
Darling I'll be on the way.

The miles go by so slowly,
It seems that time stands still,
I long for the day that I can settle down,
But I guess I never will,
Oh the cities they pass by me,
Like the ships that sail the sea,
Lord I here that highway calling,
Darling I hope you'll wait for me.

Oh it's cold here in the city,
I live my life from day to day,
Guess I'll always be a rambler,
But it's so hard to find my way,
Lord I need someone to help me,
I just can't go on this way,
I need your smiling face beside me,
So darling I'm coming home today.
