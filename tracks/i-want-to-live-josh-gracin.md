Sometimes I feel like I need
To shake myself
To wake myself
I feel like I'm just sleepwalkin'
Through my life
It's like I'm swimming in
An ocean of emotion
But still somehow slowly
Going numb inside
I don't like who I'm becomin'
I know I've gotta do somethin'
Before my life passes right by


I want to cry like the rain
Cry like the rain
Shine like sun on a beautiful mornin'
Sing to the heavens like the church bells ringin'
Fight with the devil and go down swingin'
Fly like a bird, roll like a stone
Love like I ain't afraid to be alone
Take everything that this world has to give
I want to live

Sometimes I wonder
Why I work so hard to guard my heart
Till I hardly feel anything at all
I've spent my whole life building up this ivory tower
And now that I'm in it, I keep wishing it would fall
So I could feel the ground beneath me
Really taste the air I'm breathin'
And know that I'm alive



Something deep inside
Keeps saying
Life is like a vapor
Its gone in just a twinklin' of an eye



I want to take every
Breath I can get
I want to live
Yeah, yeah
