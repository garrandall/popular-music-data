I get up in the mornin
Kick the covers from my bed
The sunlight in my eyes
Playin tricks with my head
I work like a dog
On a job every day
Tryin to make some money
So you can go and play

In the nightime
It's the right time
I said the night time
That's the right time
I want to be with you
In the night time

I come home from work
You know I'm tired and I'm beat
I try to make some supper
But I can't even eat
I jump in the shower
Wash the world off my back
I'm gonna get you baby
That's a natural fact

In the night time
That's the right time
I said the night time
That's the right time
I wanna be with you
In the night time

Come here baby
St a little bit closer
Rn your radio up so you can hear what I say
Www now ya got me turned on baby
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

A hundred million people
With nothin to say
Runnin round in circles
They just livin the day
But stick with me baby
I'll show ya how to fly
Well make such pretty music
Watch the world go by

In the night time
That's the right time
I said the night time
Night time...
Night time... night time... night time
Night time... night time... night time...
