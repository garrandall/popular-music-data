Bom bom bom, ahhh...

I couldn't help it (yeah)
I fell in love
Last night I saw her
Under stars up above

I lied to my heart
My heart knew was real
This was real

I know that someday
She wants to marry
And as I open that door

I lied to my heart
My heart knew was real
Yeah, this was real

I lied to my heart, ahh...

Honey, I love you
For ever and ever
Open your arms
And let me in your heart

I know that someday
She wants to marry
And as I open that door

I lied to my heart
My heart knew this was really love
