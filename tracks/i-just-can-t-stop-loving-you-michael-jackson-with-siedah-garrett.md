I Just Want To Lay Next To You
For Awhile
You Look So Beautiful Tonight
Your Eyes Are So Lovely
Your Mouth Is So Sweet
A Lot Of People
Misunderstand Me
That's Because They Don't
Know Me At All
I Just Want To Touch You
And Hold You
I Need You
God I Need You
I Love You So Much

Each Time The Wind Blows
I Hear Your Voice So
I Call Your Name . . .
Whispers At Morning
Our Love Is Dawning
Heaven's Glad You Came . . .
You Know How I Feel
This Thing Can't Go Wrong
I'm So Proud To Say
I Love You
Your Love's Got Me High
I Long To Get By
This Time Is Forever
Love Is The Answer

I Hear Your Voice Now
You Are My Choice Now
The Love You Bring
Heaven's In My Heart
At Your Call
I Hear Harps,
And Angels Sing
You Know How I Feel
This Thing Can't Go Wrong
I Can't Live My Life
Without You

I Just Can't Hold On

I Feel We Belong

My Life Ain't Worth Living
If I Can't Be With You

I Just Can't Stop Loving You
I Just Can't Stop Loving You
And If I Stop . . .
Then Tell Me Just What
Will I Do

'Cause I Just Can't Stop
Loving You

At Night When The
Stars Shine
I Pray In You I'll Find
A Love So True . . .

When Morning Awakes Me
Will You Come And Take Me
I'll Wait For You

You Know How I Feel
I Won't Stop Until
I Hear Your Voice Saying
"I Do"

"I Do"
This Thing Can't Go Wrong

This Feeling's So Strong

Well, My Life Ain't
Worth Living

If I Can't Be With You
I Just Can't Stop Loving You
I Just Can't Stop Loving You
And If I Stop . . .
Then Tell Me, Just What
Will I Do

I Just Can't Stop Loving You

We Can Change All The World
Tomorrow

We Can Sing Songs Of
Yesterday

I Can Say, Hey . . .Farewell
To Sorrow

This Is My Life And I,

Want To See You For Always
I Just Can't Stop Loving You

No, Baby

Oh!

I Just Can't Stop Loving You

If I Can't Stop!

And If I Stop . . .

No

Oh! Oh! Oh . . .Oh . . .

What Will I Do? Uh . . .Oh. . .
(Then Tell Me, Just What
Will I Do)

I Just Can't Stop Loving You

Hee! Hee! Hee! Know I Do
Girl!

I Just Can't Stop Loving You

You Know I Do
And If I Stop . . .

Then Tell Me, Just What
Will I Do

I Just Can't Stop Loving You
