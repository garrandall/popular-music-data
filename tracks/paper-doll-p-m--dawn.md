Imagine yourself as a link on a chain
The chain is wrapped around someone's mind
If you break off, then things start to change
And then you realize that there's no time
No direction as you fly through the wind
You stop to ponder on a pink chateau
The theme from "Mahogany" still transcends
But Quote Unquote, that's the way it goes
I'm looking at the picture again
I'm looking at the picture again
I spin the sun dial to expectation
Twenty years ago I saw you yesterday
You're looking at the picture now
I see you looking at the picture now
And for the slightest moment I watched you think about
What it's like as a paper doll


One of these days I think you will find yourself
As a paper doll (paper doll)
Paper doll
One of these days I think you will find yourself
As a paper doll (paper doll)
Oh, paper doll, baby


Imagine yourself as a cloud in the sky
You pass me by and I blow you a kiss
A thinking cloud, so you're wondering why
Only to find out it doesn't exist
Life surrounds what's presumed as wise
It wouldn't be wise until the fist uncurls
No one I don't know ever stares in my eyes
Because of the quote unquote real world
I'm thinking about yesterday
I'm actually thinking about yesterday
A thousand words say it doesn't make sense
A thousand ideas tell me otherwise
You're thinking about yesterday
And now you're thinking about yesterday
But for the slightest moment I watched you think about
What it would be like as a paper doll


One of these days I think you will find yourself
As a paper doll (paper doll)
Paper doll
One of these days I think you will find yourself
As a paper doll (paper doll)
Oh, paper doll, baby


Regardless of how you think
Regardless of how you feel
See yourself as more than a human being
It's recognizable, spiritually and mentally
Hold my hands forever, paper doll


One of these days I think you will find yourself
As a paper doll (paper doll)
Paper doll
One of these days I think you will find yourself
As a paper doll (paper doll)
Oh, paper doll, baby
