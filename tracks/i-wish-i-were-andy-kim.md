I wish I were your pillow
To touch your face at night
I wish I was the sunshine, oh
To be your morning light


I wish I were, I wish I were
All I should have been
But most of all, oh, most of all
I wish I were him

I wish I were your mirror
To watch you comb your hair
And hear you hum that
Little song you used to hum
When I was really there



Didn't I tell you
What I wanted to tell you
Oh, didn't I

Didn't I show you
What I wanted to show you
Oh, didn't I
Oh, didn't I
Oh, didn't I

You know what I do now every night
While laying in my bed
Take back all the things I did
And half the things I said

And I wish I were, I wish I were
All I should have been
But most of all, oh, most of all
I wish, I wish, I wish, oh
