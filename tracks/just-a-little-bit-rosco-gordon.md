I don't want much
I just-a want a little bit
No, I don't want it all, I told you
I just-a want a little bit
Just a eeny weeny bit
I want a teeny weeny bit of your love

Turn your lights down low
Honey, slip me a kiss
Turn your lights down low, I beg you
I just can't-a resist
But that's a eeny weeny bit
I want a teeny weeny bit of your love

I want you forever
A-just a peace of mind
Please say you'll never leave, ever
A-till the end of times

But that's a eeny weeny bit
I want a teeny weeny bit of your love

I want you forever
A-just for peace of mind
Please say you'll never leave me, ever
A-till the end of times
But that's a eeny weeny bit
I want a teeny weeny bit of your love

From just a eeny weeny bit
I want a teeny weeny bit of your love

From just a eeny weeny bit
I want a teeny weeny bit of your love

Girl!
