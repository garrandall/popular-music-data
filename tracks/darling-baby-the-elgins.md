Darling, baby
Life is so lonely without you
Life is so lonely without you
Since you've left these arms of mine
I've been alone, crying
Wondering why you left me behind


Darling, baby
Can't carry on since you've been gone
Why don't you please
Please, come on home
Let's talk it over
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Let's talk it over one more time


Oh, so many nights
I wondered whose holding you tight
Can't help but feel it should be me
Oh, it should be me
'Cause I'm forever losing sleep at night


Darling, baby
I've been loving you so long
Tell me what did I do wrong
Come back to these arms of mine
Let's talk it over
Let's talk it over one more time


Darling, baby
This world is empty without you
Keeps me crying with nothing to do
Since you've left these arms of mine
Let's talk it over, baby, baby
One more time


Mmm, darling, baby
Darling, baby
