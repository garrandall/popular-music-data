Hey baby, you've been on my mind tonight
I'm so lonely, I just had to sit down and write
I spent all yesterday tryna figure out what I'm gonna say
A letter from the heart is so hard to start, baby
How's your mama? How's the weather? How's that son of mine?
Yeah


Hey baby, been a long time since we made love
I'm stone cold, the bed's hard and the work is tough
I'm never gonna leave you again, this job ain't worth the pain
No money in the world ain't worth being away from you
Oh baby, I don't sleep without you by my side
Listen


I'm in love with you, woman
It's a common known natural fact
And I've found what I'm looking for
And it's so much more than that
I'm lost in you, I'm lost in you
I'm lost in you, I'm lost in you


Hey baby, you don't know what you've done for me
I'm so happy as any man can deserve to be
I was living in a life of sin, God knows what a mess I was in
So glad you found me, I ain't getting any younger
Hey baby, I just hope it ain't all a dream


I'm in love with you, woman
It's a common known natural fact
And I've found what I'm looking for
And it's so much more than that
I'm lost in you, I'm lost in you
I'm lost in you, I'm lost in you
Ha!




I miss you, baby
I miss you too


I miss your laughing eyes, I miss our baby crying
I wanna lay you out and kiss you all over
I'm coming home real soon, be ready 'cause when I do
I'm gonna make love to you like 15 men


I'm lost in you and I love it
I'm lost in you and I love it
I'm lost in, I'm lost in
I'm lost in you
I'm lost in, I'm lost in
I'm lost in you
And I just love it
Hey baby, I love it
Child, I love it
I'm lost in you, yeah
