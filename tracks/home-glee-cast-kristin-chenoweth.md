When I think of home 
I think of a place where there's love overflowing 
I wish I was home 
I wish I was back there 
With the things I've been knowing 

Wind that makes the tall grass bend into leaning 
Suddenly the raindrops that fall have a meaning 
Sprinklin' the scene, makes it all clean 

Maybe there's a chance for me to go back 
Now that I have some direction 
It sure would be nice to be back home 
Where there's love and affection 
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up 
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up 
Time be my friend, let me start again 

Suddenly my world has gone and changed its face 
But I still know where I'm going 
I have had my mind spun around in space 
Yet I've watched it glowing 

If you're listening God 
Please don't make it hard to know 
If we should believe in the things that we see 
Tell us, should we try and stay 
Or should we run away? 
Or would it be better just to let things be? 

Living here, in this brand new world 
Might be a fantasy, oh... 
But it taught me to love 
So it's real, real, real to me 

And I've learned 
That we must look, look inside our hearts 
To find a world full of love 
Like yours, like mine 
Like home... Home.
