This is not America
Shalalalala

Little piece of you
A little peace in me will die
(This is not a miracle)
For this is not America

Blossom fails to bloom this season
Promise not to stare too long
(This is not America)
For this is not the miracle

There was a time
A storm that blew so pure
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea

For this is not America
Shalalalala, shalalalala, shalalalala

This is not America
(No)
This is not
Shalalalala

Showman melting from the inside
Falcon spirals to the ground
(This could be the biggest sky)
So bloody red tomorrows' clouds

A little piece of you
A little peace in me will die
(This could be a miracle)
For this is not America

There was a time
A wind that blew so young
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea

For this is not a miracle
Shalalalala, shalalalala, shalalalala

This is not America
(No)
This is not
Shalalala
This is not America
(No)
This is not

This is not America
(No)
This is not
Shalalala
