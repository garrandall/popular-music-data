People say I'm the life of the party
'Cause I tell a joke or two
Although I may be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue

So take a good look at my face
You see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

I need you, need you

If you see me with another girl
Acting like I'm having fun
Although she may be cute
She's just a substitute
Girl, you're the permanent one

Ah, take a good look at my face
You see my smile looks out of place
Now look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

Outside, I'm masquerading
Inside, my hope is fading
I'm just a clown since you put me down
My smile is my make-up I wear since my break-up with you

Baby, baby, take a good look at my face
You see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

Baby, baby, baby, take a good look at my face
You see my smile looks out of place
Just look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

Baby, baby, baby, take a good look at this face
My smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
