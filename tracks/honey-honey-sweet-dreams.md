Honey honey how you thrill me aha
Honey honey
Honey honey nearly killed me aha
Honey honey

I heard about you before
I wanted to know some more
And now I know what that means
You're a love machine
Oh you make me dizzy

Honey honey let me feel it aha
Honey honey
Honey honey don't conceal it aha
Honey honey

The flame of your kiss goodnight (the flame of your kiss goodnight)
The minute you hold me tight (the minute you hold me tight)
Just don't know what to say
When you do your thing

I gonna hurt you baby
I don't want to see you cry
So stand on the ground girl you'd better not get too high

I'm gonna stick to you boy
You'll never get rid of me
There's no other place in this world that I rather would be

Honey honey touch me baby aha
Honey honey
Honey honey hold me baby aha
Honey honey

You could be a movie star (could be a movie star)
And I know just who you are (I know just who you are)
I'm hoping to say the least
You're a doggone beast

So stand on the ground girl you'd better not get too high
There's no other place in this world that I rather would be

Honey honey how you thrill me aha
Honey honey
Honey honey nearly killed me aha
Honey honey

I heard about you before (heard about you before)
I wanted to know some more (wanted to know some more)
And now I know what that means
You're a love machine
Oh you make me dizzy

Honey honey aha
Honey honey oh you make me dizzy
Honey honey.
