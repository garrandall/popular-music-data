Hold on, I'll tell you in a minute
I got a mind to go out and get it
Hold on, I'll tell you in a minute
I been thinkin' â€˜bout life and livin'

You sure lookin' fine pretty woman
I'd like to get to know you little better
Maybe learn to live up on a star
Now what you think of that girl

Just like a bee needs a hive
I need your love to keep me alive
Do you hear what I say ?

I want you to hold on, I'll tell you in a minute
When an apple's ripe, you gotta pick it
Hold on, I'll tell you in a minute
I got a feelin' that I'm gonna get it

I've seen you walkin' around little darlin'
I like the way you got it all together
What you think of you and me baby
It would be out-of-site, would you like to go out tonight ? Come on baby

I won't give up until I try
I want you girl right by my side
Do you hear what I say ?

Hold on, I'll tell you in a minute
I got a feelin' that I'm gonna get it
Hold on, I'll tell you in a minute
Life is such a gas with you in it

Cause I been searchin' a long time baby
It's worth waitin' to have you near me
But there I go dreamin' out loud again
I'm gonna find the doorway right into your heart, hear what I say now

When you tried your best
Gonna take you home little home to my nest
