People say I'm the life of the party
'Cause I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue

So take a good look at my face
You know my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

Oh I need you, need you

Since you left me if you see me with another guy
Looking like I'm having fun
Although he might be cute he's just a substitute
Because you're the permanent one

So take a good look at my face
You know my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

Outside I'm masquerading
Inside my hope is fading
I'm just a clown since you put me down
My smile is my make-up I wear since my break-up with you

Baby take a good look at my face
You know my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

Woah baby take a good look at my face
You know my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
