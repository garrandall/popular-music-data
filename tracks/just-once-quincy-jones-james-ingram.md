I did my best but I guess my best wasn't good enough
'Cause here we are back where we were before
Seems nothing ever changes we're back to being strangers
Wondering if we oughta stay or head on out the door

Just once can't we figure out what we keep doing wrong?
Why we never last for very long? What are we doing wrong?
Just once can't we find a way to finally make it right?
To make the magic last for more than just one night
If we could just get to it, I know we could break through it

I gave my all but I think my all may have been too much
'Cause Lord knows we're not getting anywhere
Seems we're always blowing whatever we've got going
And it seems at times with all we've got, we haven't got a prayer

Just once can't we figure out what we keep doing wrong?
Why the good times never last for long? Where are we going wrong?
Just once can't we find a way to finally make it right?
To make the magic last for more than just one night
I know we could break through it, if we could just get to it just once

I want to understand
Why it always comes back to good-bye?
Why can't we get ourselves in hand?
And admit to one another we're no good without the other
Take the best and make it better find a way to stay together

Just once can't we find a way to finally make it right?
Oh make the magic last for more than just one night
I know we could break through it if we could just get to it
Just once
Oh we can get to it
Just once
