You see this girl
This girl's in love with you
Yes, I'm in love
Who looks at you the way I do
When you smile I can tell we know each other very well
How can I show you I'm glad I got to know you 'cause


I've heard some talk they say you think I'm fine
This girl's in love, and what I'd do to make you mine
Tell me now, is it so, don't let me be the last to know
My hands are shakin', don't let my heart keep breaking 'cause


I need your love, I want your love
Say you're in love, and you'll be my guy
If not I'll just die


Tell me now, is it so, don't let me be the last to know
My hands are shakin', don't let my heart keep breaking 'cause
I need your love, I want your love
Say you're in love and you'll be my guy
If not I'll just die

My hands are shakin', don't let my heart keep breaking
