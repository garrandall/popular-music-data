Yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yea, wanna bump yo' body, baby
Wanna bump yo' body, wanna bump yo' body
Yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yea, wanna bump yo' body, baby
Wanna bump yo' body, wanna bump yo' body {Don't stop}

Yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yea, wanna bump yo' body, baby
Wanna bump yo' body, wanna bump yo' body {Don't stop}


Out on the dance floor, I'm holdin' you so tight
Gotta make you feel me, gotta press your body tight
Rub against my body, grind, and I'm in the mood for the same
Dancin' real freaky (Ooh), this is how you groove
What's on your mind, it's body bumpin' time, baby
Love makin', hopefully, while we grind
Uh-huh, don't you want me 'cause I want you

I'm-a grant your wish and let you know what's on my mind
It's about that time that I hit you for some bump n' grind
I'm in the mood for you, I wanna feel your groove, girl you
Can creep a move, then let's go get up on a room
Makin' me do things that I never did before
Behind closed doors I wanna make you shout for more
This freaky thing is on, body bumpin' all night long
No doubt about it if you want it I can bring it on bumpy

Bumpin', you and me, everybody get your freak on {Don't stop}
