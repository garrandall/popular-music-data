Baby did I ever make you a promise
And I've got so busy that is slipped my mind
These things happen, you know

Then I'm asking you to forgive me
I'm so sorry and I apologize
Oh yeah
'Cause I know to a woman
Her man's promises keep her goin'
Yes they do
I've got to do a little bit better than I've been doing

Baby do you ever need me to hold you
And I was somewhere else at the time
This fool, am I

Then I'm asking you to forgive me
I'm so sorry and I apologize
Oh yeah
'Cause I know to a woman
Her man's love keeps her goin'
Yes it does
I've got to do a little bit better than I've been doin'

A man gets so busy tryin' to meet
His little man's needs
That he forgets some other promises he's made
Oh yeah
But when a man's got himself a woman
That's so sweet and understandin'
You know that man has got it made
In the shade

Baby, whatever time you were crying
And I wasn't there to dry your eyes
Wooh, I'm asking you to forgive me
I'm so sorry and I apologize
Oh yes I am
'Cause I know to a woman
Her man's attentions keep her going
I've got to do a little bit better than I've been doing
