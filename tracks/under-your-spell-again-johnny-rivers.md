You got me under your spell again
Saying those things again
Making me believe that you're just mine
You got me dreaming those dreams again
Thinking those things again
I gotta take you back just one more time

I swore the last time that you let me down
That I wouldn't see you if you came around
But I can't tell my heart what's right or wrong
And I've been so lonely since you've been gone

You got me under your spell again
Saying those things again
Making me believe that you're just mine
You got me dreaming those dreams again
Thinking those things again
I gotta take you back just one more time

Well, every body tells me that I'm a fool
That I never should have put my faith in you
And way down deep inside I guess I know it's true
But no one else can make me feel the way you do

You got me under your spell again
Saying those things again
Making me believe that you're just mine
You got me dreaming those dreams again
Thinking those things again
I gotta take you back just one more time
