I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)

I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth

Hop up out the bed, turn my swag on
Pay no attention to them haters, because we whip 'em off
And we ain't doing nothing wrong
So don't tell me nothing, I'm just tryn'na have fun
So keep the party jumping

So what's up (yeah...)
And now they don't know what to do
We turn our back and whip our hair and just shake them off
Shake them off, shake them off, shake them off
Don't let haters keep me off my grind

Keep my head up, I know I'll be fine
Keep fighting until I get there
When I'm down and I feel like giving up, I think again
I whip my hair back and forth

I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth

I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth

I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth

I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth
I'ma get more shine than a little bit

Soon as I hit the stage: applause, I'm hearing it
Whether it's black stars, black cars, I'm feeling it
But can't none of them whip it like I do
I, I get to that mmm yeah, I go hard
When they see me pull up, I whip it real hard
I whip it real hard, gonna do it real hard, I whip it real hard
Don't let haters keep me off my grind

Keep my head up, I know I'll be fine
Keep fighting until I get there
When I'm down and I feel like giving up, I think again
I whip my hair back and forth

I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth

I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth

I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth

I whip my hair back and forth (ok, ok, just whip it, yeah)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth
All my Ladies, if you feel me

Come on, Do it, do it, whip your hair
Don't matter if it's long, short
Do it, do it, whip your hair
All my Ladies if you feel me

Come on, do it, do it, whip your hair
Don't matter if it's long, short
Do it, do it, whip your hair (your hair, your hair...)
I whip my hair back and forth

I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth

I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth
