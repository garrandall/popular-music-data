So I'm in love without a dime
So I'm in love, gonna sing it shy

Have you ever seen a flower
Tryin' to bloom in a dry barren land?
But then comes a sweet, sweet shower
Just to lend a helpin' hand

Like the love of you and I
All at once it came alive

You brought me love
And your love is life

Did you ever watch a mother
And how tender she treats a child?
And the birds in the treetops
How they protect their young from the wild?

Girl, your love, it comforts me
And that's my security

You brought me love
And your love is life

Now this is the song of love
Let everybody sing along for love
Let sing it, yeah

Like the love of you and I
All at once it came alive

You brought me love
And your love, yeah, yeah
