I can't go any further than this
I want you so badly, it's my biggest wish

Cool, I spend my time just thinking thinking thinking bout you
Every single day yes, I'm really missin' missin' you
And all those things we used to used to used to used to do
Hey, girl, what's up? It used to used to be just me and you

I spend my time just thinking thinking thinking bout you
Every single day, yes I'm really missing missing you
And all those things we used to used to used to used to do
Hey, girl, what's up? What's up? What's up? What's up?

Can you meet me halfway, right at the borderline
That's where I'm gonna wait for you
I'll be looking out, night and day
Took my heart to the limit, and this is where I'll stay

I can't go any further than this
I want you so bad, it's my only wish

Girl, I travel 'round the world and even sail the seven seas
Across the universe I go to other galaxies
Just tell me where to go, just tell me where you wanna meet
I navigate myself myself to take me where you be

'Cause, girl, I want, I, I, I want you right now
I travel uptown (town) I travel downtown
I wanna have you around ('round) like every single day
I love you alwayâway
I'll meet you halfway

Can you meet me halfway?
Right at the borderline
That's where I'm gonna wait for you
I'll be looking out, night and day
Took my heart to the limit, and this is where I'll stay

I can't go any further than this
I want you so bad, it's my only wish
I can't go any further than this
I want you so bad, it's my only wish

Let's walk the bridge to the other side
Just you and I, just you and I
I will fly, I'll fly the skies, for you and I, for you and I
I will try until I die, for you and I, for you and I, for, for you and I
For, for you and I, for, for you and I, for you and I

Can you meet me halfway?
Can you meet me halfway?
Can you meet me halfway?
Can you meet me halfway?

Meet me halfway, right at the borderline
That's where I'm gonna wait for you
I'll be looking out, night and day
Took my heart to the limit, and this is where I'll stay

I can't go any further than this
I want you so bad it's my only wish
I can't go any further than this
I want you so bad it's my only wish
