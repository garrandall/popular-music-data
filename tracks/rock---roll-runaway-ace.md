Rock and roll runaway
Rock and roll runaway

Even though she's only in her teens
She's really into making a scene
As a rock and roll runaway

Don't wanna go to school no more
Don't wanna work on a factory floor

Why you left home, honey
Heaven only knows
I've been trying so hard to find out
I don't even get that close
I got a feeling, I got a feeling
Baby, you did not like your role

Come on, own up, honey
You've been searching for your soul
Searching for your soul

Don't wanna go to school no more
Don't wanna work on a factory floor

Why you left home, honey
Heaven only knows
I've been trying so hard to find out
I don't even get that close
I got a feeling, I got a feeling
Baby, you did not like your role

Come on, own up, honey
You've been searching for your soul
Searching for your soul

Rock and roll runaway
You know she's wearing high heel shoes
She's really into them rhythm and blues
She's a rock and roll runaway

She don't wanna go to school no more
Don't wanna work on a factory floor
