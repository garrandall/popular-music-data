Dream
Dream, dream, dream
Dream
Dream, dream, dream

When I want you in my arms
When I want you and all your charms
Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream
Dream, dream, dream

When I feel blue in the night
And I need you to hold me tight
Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream

I can make you mine
Taste your lips of wine
Anytime night or day
Only trouble is
Gee whiz
I'm dreaming my life away

I need you so that I could die
I love you so and that is why
Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream

I can make you mine
Taste your lips of wine
Anytime night or day
Only trouble is
Gee whiz
I'm dreaming my life away

I need you so that I could die
I love you so and that is why
Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream

Dream, dream, dream
Dream
Dream, dream, dream
Dream
