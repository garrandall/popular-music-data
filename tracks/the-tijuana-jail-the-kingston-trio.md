We went one day about a month ago (ha ha ha) to have a little fun (ah ha) in Mexico
We ended up in a gambling spot (ha ha ha) where the liquor flowed and the dice were hot

So, here we are in the Tijuana jail. Ain't got no friends to go our bail
So, here we'll stay 'cause we can't pay. Just send our mail to the Tijuana jail

I was shooting dice, raking in the dough (long green) and then I heard a whistle blow
We started to run when a man in blue said, "Senor, come with me 'cause I want you."

So, here we are in the Tijuana jail. Ain't got no friends to go our bail
So, here we'll stay 'cause we can't pay. Just send our mail to the Tijuana jail

Just five hundred dollars and they'll set us free. I couldn't raise a penny if they threatened me
I know five hundred don't sound like much (cheap), but just try to find somebody to touch

So, here we are in the Tijuana jail. Ain't got no friends to go our bail
So, here we'll stay 'cause we can't pay. Just send our mail to the Tijuana jail
So, here we are in the Tijuana jail. Ain't got no friends to go our bail
So, here we'll stay 'cause we can't pay. Just send our mail to the Tijuana jail
