Riding along on a carousel, trying to catch up to you.
Riding along on a carousel, will I catch up to you?

Horses chasing 'cause they're racing.
So they ain't so far.

On a carousel, on a carousel.

Nearer and nearer by changing horses, still so far away.
People fighting for their places just get in my way.
Soon you'll leave and then I'll lose you
Still we're going round.

On a carousel, on a carousel,
Round and round and round and round
Round and round and round and round with you.
Up, down, up, down, up, down, too.

As she leaves, she drops the presents that she won before.
Pulling ducks out of the water, got the highest score.
Now's my chance and I must take it, a case of do-or-die.

On a carousel, on a carousel,
Round and round and round and round
Round and round and round and round with you.
Up, down, up, down, up, down, too

Riding along on a carousel, trying to catch up to you.
Riding along on a carousel, will I catch up to you?

Now we take our ride together
No more chasing her.

On a carousel, on a carousel...
