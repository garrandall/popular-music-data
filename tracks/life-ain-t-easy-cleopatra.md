(Life ain't easy
Gonna change
Don't just listen
Think about it, life ain't easy)

When I see those people sitting hungry in the street
I put myself in their shoes, finding safer places to sleep
People just walk past them when they know there's something wrong
When all I want to know is why this whole thing's going on because

(Life ain't easy) And how we are is (Gonna change)
And make this world a better place (Don't just listen)
Oh, you gotta take it in
Think about it and then we can begin (Life ain't easy)

Life don't fast forever and forever isn't long
So take a chance in life at the moment you can hear this song
No use just thinking about what tomorrow brings
You've got to lift your head up high and do the right thing because

(Life ain't easy) And how we are is (Gonna change)
And make this world a better place (Don't just listen)
Oh, you gotta take it in
Think about it and then we can begin (Life ain't easy)

(Life ain't easy) Ooohooohooohooo
No, no, no (It ain't easy
It ain't easy)

What I'm telling you is (Life ain't easy)
(Gonna change)
(Don't just listen)
(Think about it, life ain't easy) I'm saying

(Life ain't easy) Oh, life ain't easy (Gonna change)
Ooohooo, ooohooo, darling (Don't just listen)
You gotta take it, take it
Think about it) and then we can begin (Life ain't easy)

(Life, it ain't easy) It ain't easy
(Oh, life just ain't easy) No, life ain't easy
(Life just ain't easy) Take it in, ohoho
(Oh, life just ain't easy)

(Life)
