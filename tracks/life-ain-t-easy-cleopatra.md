Like Cleopatra 
Got the masses at my feet
Got a living dwell 
Down on easy street
I'm the latest craze (oh yeah)
And if you stay a while
Inevitably
You gone be bitin' my style
In your later days (well, well, well)
Let me tell you what is fact
And what is true
I get high and that aint that much to do
I'm always in a daze (uh huh)
That was just a dream I had
Last night in my bubble bath
Next to my wishing well
Oh yeah, you betta


Get up, get out
And do somethin'
Don't let the days of your life pass you by
You got to
Get up, get out
And do somethin'
How will you make it if you never even try
Get up, get out
And do somethin'
Can't spend your whole life tryin' to get high
You got to get up, get out
And do somethin'
'Cause you and I have to do
For you and I


What's been happenin'
How you doin'
Where you been
I'm further behind now
Than I was back then
Lost in some old maze (uh huh)
Some years have passed me by
All I want is to go get high
I'll get it together
Some other day


In my dreams I dwell (uh huh huh)
'Cause all my dreams are swell (woo, woo, woo)
You would too
If you could see them
That's what I know
I gotta go
Get up
Get out and (yeah)


Heaven's at my feet
Got a living dwell 
Down on easy street
I'm the latest craze (uh huh)
It's just a dream I had
Last night in my bubble bath
Next to my wish--yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah



Why don't you do somethin'?
