I don't need a whole lots of money,
I don't need a big fine car.
I got everything that a man could want,
I got more than I could ask for.
I don't have to run around,
I don't have to stay out all night.
'Cause I got a sweet lovin' woman,
And she knows just how to treat me right.

Oh my baby, she's alright,
Oh my baby, she's clean out-of-sight.
Don't you know that she's some kind of wonderful.
She's some kind of wonderful ... yes she is
Some kind of wonderful, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahhh ...

I hold her in my arms,
She sets my soul on fire.
Oooh, when my baby kisses me,
My heart becomes filled with desire.
She wraps her lovin' arms around me,
She drives me out of my mind.
Yeah, when my baby kisses me,
Chills run up and down my spine.

Oh my baby, she's alright,
My baby, she's clean out-of-sight.
Don't you know that she is some kind of wonderful.
Some kind of wonderful ... yes she is,
Some kind of wonderful, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahhh ...

Is there anybody, got a sweet little woman like mine?
Is there anybody, got a sweet little woman like mine?
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?

Some kind of wonderful.
Talkin' 'bout my baby.
She's some kind of wonderful.
Talkin' 'bout my baby.
