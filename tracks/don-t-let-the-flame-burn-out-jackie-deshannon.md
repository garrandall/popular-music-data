You gave me somethin'
I never had
And, baby, I can feel the change in me
But you can't say how long
You'll stay around
I guess I'll just have to wait and see

Nobody said it was easy
To get the love that you need
But the one who is givin'
Is the one who receives

Oh, honey, don't let
Don't let the flame burn out
These nights of sweet emotion

Don't let
Don't let the flame burn out
Words are softly spoken

Don't let
Don't let the flame burn out
Hearts are lost and stolen

Don't let it burn out
Don't let it burn out
Don't let it burn out

I know I'm helpless
Where you're concerned
I see the danger that lies ahead
There's so many reasons
You're on my mind
Should I believe the thing you've said?

Nobody said it was easy
To get the love that you need
But the one who is givin'
Is the one who receives

Oh, honey, don't let
Don't let the flame burn out
You're the one and only

Don't let
Don't let the flame burn out
I need you to hold me

Don't let
Don't let the flame burn out
When you're away I'm lonely

Don't let it burn out
Don't let it burn out
Don't let it burn out

No, no, don't
Don't let the flame burn out
Ooh, honey, don't
Don't let the flame burn out

Don't let it
Don't let the flame burn out

Don't let it burn out
Don't let the flame, burn out

Don't let the flame burn out
