Give me those bright lights, long nights
(C'mon, yeah)
High rise, over time
(Pussycat Dolls)


Give me them bright lights, long nights
Party till the sun is rising
High rise, over time
Working till the moon is shining
Hot guys, fly girls
Never thought I'd say
I feel on top of the world
I feel on top of the world
Hey


I'm ready for the pressure
The drama and the pleasure
Got my whole life here in front of me
I'm taking over when I hit the streets


Glamour, glitter, and gold
Nothing is stopping you, nothing is stopping me
With this frenzy outta control
Imma stay in pursuit, do what I gotta do


Give me them bright lights, long nights
Party till the sun is rising
High rise, over time
Working till the moon is shining
Hot guys, fly girls
Never thought I'd say
I feel on top of the world
I feel on top of the world
Hey


Its like a roller coaster
One step away, I'm closer
I can see it there within my reach
Won't let the city get on top of me


Glamour, glitter, and gold
Nothing is stopping you, nothing is stopping me
With this frenzy outta control
Imma stay in pursuit, do what I gotta do


Give me them bright lights, long nights
Party till the sun is rising
High rise, over time
Working till the moon is shining
Hot guys, fly girls
Never thought I'd say
I feel on top of the world
I feel on top of the world
Hey


I can do it on my own
(Can't stop me)
Make another place my home
(Can't slow me down)
The only thing I know
(Is I won't fall)
And I have it all


Give me them bright lights, long nights
Oh, yeah
High rise, over time
Working till the moon is shining
Hot guys, fly girls
Never thought I'd say
I feel on top of the world
I feel on top of the world


Give me them bright lights, long nights
Party till the sun is rising
High rise, over time
Working till the moon is shining
Hot guys, fly girls
Never thought I'd say
I feel on top of the world
I feel on top of the world


Give me them bright lights, long nights
(Pussycat Dolls)
High rise, over time
(Whoa)
Hot guys, fly girls
Never thought I'd say
I feel on top of the world
I feel on top of the world
Hey
