There was a time
I used to look into my father's eyes
In a happy home
I was a king, I had a golden throne

Those days are gone
Now they're memories on the wall
I hear the songs from the places where I was born

Up on a hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said...

Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah

There was a time
I met a girl of a different kind
We ruled the world
I thought I'd never lose her out of sight

We were so young
I think of her now and then
I still hear the songs reminding me of a friend

Up on a hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said

Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh

See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh
