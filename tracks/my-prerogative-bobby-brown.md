It's love...
It's love...
Love... get busy
Everybody's talkin all this stuff about me (Now now)
Why don't they just let me live (Oh oh oh)
I don't need permission
Make my own decisions (Oh!)
That's my prerogative

They say I'm crazy
I really don't care
That's my prerogative
They say I'm nasty
But I don't give a damn
Gettin girls is how I live
Some ask me questions
Why am I so real
But they don't understand me
I really don't know the deal
About a brother
Trying hard to make it right
Not long ago
Befo' I win this fight
SING!

Everybody's talkin all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live (Tell me why)
I don't need permission
Make my own decisions (Oh!)
That's my prerogative
It's my prerogative
(It's my prerogative)

It's the way that I wanna live (It's my prerogative)
I can do just what I feel (It's my prerogative)
No one can tell me what to do (It's my prerogative)
Cause what I'm doin
I'm doin for you now

Don't get me wrong
I'm really not zooped
Ego trips is not my thing
All these strange relationships
Really gets me down
I see nothin wrong
With spreadin myself around
SING!

Everybody's talkin all this stuff about me (yeah)
Why don't they just let me live (Tell me why)
I don't need permission (I don't need)
Make my own decisions (my own decisions)
That's my prerogative
It's my prerogative
(It's my prerogative)

I can do what I wanna do (It's my prerogative)
Truly live my life (It's my prerogative)
I'm doin it just for you (It's my prerogative)
Tell me, tell me

Why can't I live my life (Live my life)
Without all of the things that people say (Ohhh Ohhh)

Yo tell it, kick it like this
Oh no nooo

I can do what I wanna do
Me and you
Together, together, together, together, together

Everybody's talkin all this stuff about me (everybody's talkin)
Why don't they just let me live (why)
(Why don't they just let me live girl)
I don't need permission (I don't need permission)
Make my own decisions
That's my prerogative

Everybody's talkin all this stuff about me (Everybody's talkin)
Why don't they just let me live
(Why don't they just let me live)
I don't need permission (I don't need)
Make my own decisions (My own decisions)
That's my prerogative
