The trees grow tall
Where I come from
The leaves are green and fine
I was born in a one room shack
In a field of Georgia Pines

I grew up and I got tired
Of that one room shack
So I went a wandering
And now I wanna go back


Georgia Pines, Georgia Pines
How I missed that home of mine
Up here in the city
Just a wasting my time
There ain't nothing green
But the rich man's money
The buildings are so tall
The sun can't shine
Oh, how I wanna go home
To my Georgia Pines

I remember long ago
Blue eyes and golden hair
When I get home
I'll make her mine
Oh, God, please let her be there



Georgia Pines, Georgia Pines
Georgia Pines, Georgia Pines
Georgia Pines, Georgia Pines
Georgia Pines...
