Lonely Lonely 
The "L" is for the laughter, we shared from the start 
"O" is for the only girl in my heart 
The "N" is for the night, you told me we were though 
For you had found somebody new 
"E" is for the end of my world, a place I shared with only you 
Empty, my world is dark 
Loneliness has just begun 
The "L" is for the Love that was meant for me only 
And "Y" Why did you leave me lonely. Lonely
