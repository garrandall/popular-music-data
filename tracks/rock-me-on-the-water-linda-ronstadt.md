Oh people look around you
The signs are everywhere
You left him for somebody other than you
To be the one to care

You're lost inside your houses
There's no time to find you now
Oh your walls are burning
And your towers are turning
I've gotta leave you here
And try to get down to the sea somehow

Rock me on the water
Sister won't you soothe my fevered brow
O-oh rock me on the water
Gotta get down to the sea somehow

The road is filled with homeless souls
Every woman child and man
Who have no idea where they will go
But they'll help you if they can

Now everyone must have some thought
That's gonna pull them through somehow
Well the fires are raging hotter and hotter
But the sisters of the sun
Are gonna rock me on the water now

Rock me on the water
Sister won't you soothe my fevered brow
O-oh rock me on the water
I gotta get down to the sea somehow

Oh people look among you
It's there your hope must lie
There's a seabird above you gliding in one place
Like Jesus in the sky
We all must do the best we can
And then hang onto that gospel cloud
When my life is over
Gonna stand for the father
But the sisters of the sun
Are gonna rock me on the water now

Rock me on the water
Sister won't you soothe my fevered brow
O-oh rock me on the water
Then maybe I'll remember
Maybe I'll remember how

Rock me on the water
The wind is with me now
O-oh rock me on the water
Gotta get down to the sea somehow
I gotta get down to the sea somehow
