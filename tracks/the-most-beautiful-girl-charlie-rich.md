Hey
Did you happen to see
The most beautiful girl in the world?
And if you did, was she crying, crying?

Hey
If you happen to see
The most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry
Tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her

I woke up this morning
Realized what I had done
I stood alone in the cold gray dawn
I knew I'd lost my morning sun

I lost my head and I said some things
Now comes the heartaches that morning brings
I know I'm wrong
And I couldn't see
I let my world slip away from me

So, hey
Did you happen to see
The most beautiful girl in the world?
And if you did, was she crying, crying?

Hey
If you happen to see
The most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry
Tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her

If you happen to see the most beautiful girl
That walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry
Tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her
