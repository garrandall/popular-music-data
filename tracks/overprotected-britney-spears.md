I need time, love, joy
I need space, love
I need... me
(Action!)


Say hello to the girl that I am
You're gonna have to see through my perspective
I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am
And I don't wanna be so damn protected


There must be another way
'Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say what a girl is to do?
God, I need some answers


What am I to do with my life?
(You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just gotta do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected


I'll tell 'em what I like, what I want, and what I don't
But every time I do, I stand corrected
Things that I've been told
I can't believe what I hear about the world
I realize I'm overprotected


There must be another way
'Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say what a girl is to do?
God, I need some answers


What am I to do with my life?
(You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just gotta do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel (Help the way I feel)
But my life has been so overprotected


I need time, love
I need space
(This is it, this is it)


I don't need nobody telling me just what I wanna
What I, what, what, what I'm gonna (I need) do about my destiny
I say no, no, nobody's telling me just
What, what, what I wanna do, do
I'm so fed up with people telling me to be someone else but me (Action!)


What am I to do with my life?
(You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just gotta do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected


I don't need nobody telling me just what I wanna
What I, what, what, what I'm gonna do about my destiny
I say no, no, nobody's telling me just
What, what, what I wanna do, do
I'm so fed up with people telling me to be someone else but me


What am I to do with my life?
(You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just gotta do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel (Help the way I feel)
But my life has been so overprotected
