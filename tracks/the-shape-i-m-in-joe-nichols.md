I've got a number on a napkin, a poundin' in my head
Takes everything I've got to crawl out of bed
I lost a hell of a woman, freedom caught me on the chin
But I'm doin' alright for the shape I'm in

The sun came up again this morning
I got a call from a long lost friend
Planned us a little road trip down to New Orleans
It ain't much but it beats where I've been

Yea I'm doin' alright
I'm doin' alright
I'm doin' alright for the shape I'm in

Well I'm gettin' better at barely gettin' by
When I look at her picture I don't break down and cry
And all this time on my hands it's gettin' easier to spend
Cause I'm doin' alright for the shape I'm in

The sun came up again this morning
I took my old fastback for a spin
Now when it rains it ain't always pouring
And I'm learning how to live again

Yea I'm doin' alright
I'm doin' alright
I'm doin' alright for the shape I'm in

Yea I'm doin' alright
Yes I'm doin' alright
Yea I'm doin' alright for the shape I'm in

Yes I'm doin' alright
Yea I'm doin' alright
Yea I'm doin' alright for the shape I'm in
