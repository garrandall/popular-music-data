Uh, yeah


It's over and done, but the heartache lives on inside
And who is the one you're clinging to instead of me tonight?


And where are you now, now that I need you?
Tears on my pillow, wherever you go, go
Cry me a river that leads to your ocean
You'll never see me fall apart


In the words of a broken heart, it's just emotions taking me over
Caught up in sorrow, lost in the song
But if you don't come back, come home to me, darlin'
Don't you know, there's no-
(Nobody left in this world to hold me tight)
And don't you know, there's no-
(Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight)
Kiss goodnight
(Goodnight, goodnight)


I'm there at your side, a part of all the things you are
But you gotta find some one else
You gotta go find your shinning star


And where are you now, now that I need you?
Tears on my pillow, wherever you go, go
Cry me a river that leads to your ocean
You'll never see me fall apart


In the words of a broken heart, it's just emotions taking me over
Caught up in sorrow, lost in the song
But if you don't come back, come home to me, darlin'
Don't you know, there's no-
(Nobody left in this world to hold me tight)
And don't you know, there's no-
(Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight)
Kiss goodnight
(Goodnight, goodnight)


And where are you now, now that I need you?
Tears on my pillow, wherever you go, go
Cry me a river that leads to your ocean
You'll never see me fall apart


In the words of a broken heart, it's just emotions taking me over
Caught up in sorrow, lost in the song
But if you don't come back, come home to me, darlin'
Don't you know, there's no-
(Nobody left in this world to hold me tight)
And don't you know, there's no-
(Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight)
Kiss goodnight
(Goodnight, goodnight)
