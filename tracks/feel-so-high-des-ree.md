Show me your company
Come and tell me who you'll be
I'll try and take things easy
I'll be loose, I'll be carefree
I'm living for tomorrow not today
Gotta make my plans so in case
I'll be prepared when I see you smiling

'Cause I feel so high away, I'm reaching out for your sky
I've boundless energies, I feel I could run a million miles
I'm riding on the wheel of fortune
Taking me to places far and free
I feel so high when I approach your sky

When I touch your sky, I, I want my joy to be discreet
Can't seem to hide the feeling that you knock me from my seat
When I'm talking with my friends
You're the subject every time
I know I bore them but they do it to me sometimes

'Cause I feel so high away, I'm reaching out for your sky
I've boundless energies, I feel I could run a million miles
I'm riding on the wheel of fortune
Taking me to places far and free
I feel so high when I approach your sky

I've seen you exposed, your thoughts are nude
Come on, take off your pride baby
You should wash your attitude
I'm sitting here watching you baby
Trying to pretend you're cool and calm
Come on now, you can tell me baby
Did the gypsy read your palm?

Show me your company, come and tell me who you'll be
I'll try and take things easy, I'll be loose, I'll be carefree
I'm living for tomorrow not today
Gotta make my plans so in case
I'll be prepared when I see you smiling

'Cause I feel so high away, I'm reaching out for your sky
I've boundless energies, I feel I could run a million miles
I'm riding on the wheel of fortune
Taking me to places far and free

I feel so high when I approach your sky
I feel so high, when I'm touching your sky baby
I feel so high
I feel so high, when I'm touching your sky baby
I feel so high yeah, yeah
I feel so high, when I'm touching your sky baby
I feel so high
I feel so high, when I'm touching your sky baby
I feel so high yeah, yeah
I feel so high, when I'm touching your sky baby
