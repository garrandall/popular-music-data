Oh, father high in heaven
Smile down upon your son
He's busy with his money games
His women and his gun

Oh, Jesus, save me!

And the unsung Western hero
He killed an Indian or three
And then he made his name in Hollywood
To set the white man free

Oh, Jesus, save me!

If Jesus saves, well, He'd better save Himself
From the gory glory seekers who use His name in death

Yeah, oh, Jesus, save me!

If Jesus saves, well, He'd better save Himself
From the gory glory seekers who use His name in death

Oh, Jesus, save me!

Well, I saw him in the city
And on the mountains of the moon
His cross was rather bloody
He could hardly roll His stone

Oh, Jesus, save me!
