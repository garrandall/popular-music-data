Hey
There's a hum in the air
Hey...
Every stars in a spin
Hey
Something's saying out there
Hey
Something's gonna begin
For me
Never at no time was there a night like this
(Never at no time was there a night like this)
Never at no time was every star so clear
(Never at no time was every star so clear)
Never at no time has my heart beat so fast
(Never at no time has my heart beat so fast)
Never at no time was every dream so near
Somewhere there's someone else
Who feels it too
Something rare and wonderful
Is due
Hey
There's a fire in the sky
(There's a fire in the sky)
Hey...
And the moon's in a dive
(And the moon's in a dive)
Hey
It's a dream you can't buy
(It's a dream you can't buy)
Hey
Life is coming alive
For me
Never at no time was there a night like this
(Never at no time was there a night like this)
Never at no time was every star so clear
(Never at no time was every star so clear)
Never at no time has my heart beat so fast
(Never at no time has my heart beat so fast)
For me
For me
For me
(Never at no time was there a night like this)
For me
For me
(Never at no time was there a night like this)
For me
For me
(Never at no time was there a night like this)
For me
For me
(Never at no time was there a night like this)
For me
(Never at no time was there a night like this)
