I don't know what your folks got against me, girl
But I do know that I want you permanently in my world
What's age or color or money when you love one another?
I know you keep saying to me, 'Our love will win and then you'll see.'


But baby, sail away with me
I can't wait another day
So you and I can be free, oh baby
To share our love under the stars above
We'll spend the rest of our lives making love
Morning, noon, and night


Take the wings from a bird and don't you know it can't fly
If they take your love from me, I will surely die
Don't get lost in all they're saying
Games are all that they're playing
I know you keep saying to me, 'Our Love will win and then you'll see.'


But baby, sail away with me
I can't wait another day, girl
So you and I can be free, oh baby
To share our love under the stars above
We'll spend the rest of our lives making love
Morning, noon, and night, baby


Yeah, baby
True love is a once in a lifetime thing, my dear
We can't let what others think about us destroy what we share
You said 'We can take the rejection
We can build a wall of protection.'
I can feel the pressure closing in all around us
Girl, don't let them destroy our love


But baby, sail away with me
Where you, girl, and I can be free
We're gonna share our love under the stars above
We'll spend the rest of our lives
Making love morning, noon and night
Baby, sail away with me
Where you and I can be free
Girl, we're gonna share our love under the stars above
We'll spend the rest of our lives
Making love morning, noon and night
Baby, sail away with me
Where you and I can be free
Can't wait another day
We're gonna share our love under the stars above
