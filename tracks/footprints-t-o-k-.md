One set of footprints inna di sand and yuh a grumble and a screw a seh it shoulda be two remember one thing mi youth a Father God have the plan so when
you see one set of footprints a God carry you


Hurry up and come back was the last thing she said to her son the day his life was taken she did not know he wouldn't come back he died from the bullet
of a gun and now her little boy is gone


She said help me, Lord help me and she looked up to the sky and she heard a voice reply


When you cry I cry
I cry along with you
When you smile I smile
I smile along with you



Another baby left homeless
abandoned when he was two so the street side kids at the shopping mall was the family he knew it's not easy being homeless sometimes you have to do
what you have to do and he didn't have a mom or dad to help him get through


He said help me, Father help me
and then he looked up to the sky and he heard a voice reply




It was early Sunday morning mi get up a watch the news then mi hear seh last night a seaview dem kill a youth den mamma tell mi seh her church sister
Jacqueline just lose her brother over seaview gardens when she tell mi jah jah know ti mash mi up naah tell nuh lie but yuh know seh man a thuggist so yuh
naah go see me cry everyday and every night she still a ask the father why her brother had to die she heard a voice reply
