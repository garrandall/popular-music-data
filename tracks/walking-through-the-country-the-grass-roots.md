Groovy day, a sunny day
Walking through the country
Just a breeze and I feel at ease
Walkin' through the country

Blades of grass playin' with my feet
And there's nothing so sweet
As the way you treat me

Walkin' through the country
Walkin' through the country
Walkin' through the country

Off with your shoes, forget those blues
You're walkin' through the country
It's gotta be a groove, the love you'll move
Walkin' through the country

Beautiful sound goin' through the trees
Each a different tune
They're all tellin' me

You're walkin' through the country
You're walkin' through the country
You're walkin' through the country

Singin'...
Mmm-mm
Keep walkin' baby

I know there's someone, someone who needs you
Walkin' through the country together
And love's gonna come to you

Oh, what a groovy, groovy day, sunny day
Walkin' through the country
Just a breeze and I feel at ease
Walkin' through the country

Blades of grass playin' with my feet
And there's nothin' so sweet
As the way you treat me

You're walkin' through the country
You're walkin' through the country
You're walkin' through the country

Sing it!
Walkin' through the country, baby
Don't it feel good
Walkin' through the country
Feels good now, doesn't it?
Oh, yeah...
