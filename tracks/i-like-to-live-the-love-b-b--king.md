My song is a serious matter
It reflects what I feel
If I say I love you, I mean it
'Cause in my song every line is for real

Every man or woman
Enjoys going home to a peaceful situation
To give love and receive love
Without any complications

Whether my tune is short or long
Whether my lyrics are weak or strong


I like to live the love that I sing about
In my song
I like to live the love that I sing about
In my song

Music is love and my love is music
In perfect harmony
So when I sing, I have sung all about
The love of you and me

I never got angry with my guitar
'Cause when I strike a chord it gives me what I wanna hear
So I'm finding out that
We are quite like my song together, my dear

Outside answers should always be forbidden
Problems should be solved and never hidden

I like to live the love that I sing about
In my song
I like to live the love that I sing about
In my song

I like to live the love that I sing about
In my song
I like to live the love that I sing about
In my song

I like to live the love that I sing about
In my song
