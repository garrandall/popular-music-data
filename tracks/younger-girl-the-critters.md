She's one of those girls who seems to come in the spring
One look in her eyes and you'll forget everything
You had ready to say
And I saw her today, yeah

A younger girl keeps a-rollin' 'cross my mind
No matter how much I try, I can't seem to leave her memory behind
I remember her eyes, soft, dark, and brown
Said she'd never been in trouble, or even in town
A younger girl keeps a-rollin' 'cross my mind

Ah, a younger girl keeps a-rollin' 'cross my mind

Should I hang around, acting like her brother
In a few more years, they'd call us right for each other
But why?
If I wait I'll just die, yeah

A younger girl keeps a-rollin' 'cross my mind
No matter how much I try, I can't seem to leave her memory behind
I remember her eyes, soft, dark, and brown
Said she'd never been in trouble, or even in town
A younger girl keeps a-rollin' 'cross my mind

She's one of those girls who seems to come in the spring
One look in her eyes and you'll forget everything
She's one of those girls who seems to come in the spring
One look in her eyes and you'll forget everything
