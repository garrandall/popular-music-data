Way out here, working on the docks
Everyone sees the long day through
But what would I do without the nights
And the phone, and the chance just to talk to you?
Oh, what would I do now—
Hey—just to talk to you
A thousand miles away?


What I wouldn't give for only one night
A little relief in sight
Or someday when times weren't so tight

When the day goes down on the water town—
When the sun sinks low all around—
That's when I know I, I need you now
Yes, you're what I miss: every little kiss
Every little one! Every little one


Everybody here's a number, not a name
But I guess that's all right with me
As I sit alone after a long day
In the absence of company
Oh I let my mind wander—
Hey, yeah—a thousand miles away


What I wouldn't give for only one night
A little relief in sight
Or someday when times weren't so tight

When the day goes down on the water town—
When the sun sinks low all around—
That's when I know I, I need you now
Yes, you're what I miss: every little kiss
Every little one! Every little one

Hey, yeah

Hey, yeah


What I wouldn't give for only one night
A little relief in sight
Or someday when times weren't so tight

When the day goes down on the water town—
When the sun sinks low all around—
That's when I know I, I need you now
Yes, you're what I miss: every little kiss
Every little one! Every little one

Hey, yeah

Do-do-do do-do do doo

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
