Oh babe
Never thought I would be like this
Wide awake waitin' on a goodnight kiss
Sippin' ninety proof
Talkin' to the moon
Countin' down the hours till its two AM
Never thought I would be like this

But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab shootin' me a text sayin' "Comin' home soon"
As long as I can bet on ya crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin' sayin' havin' a good time
Out with your girls
Girl do what you do
No matter how late
Baby I'll be stayin' up
I can't sleep without you

I'd be tossin' and turnin' all night babe
From the smell of your hair on the pillow case
Even if I tried without you by my side I'd be dreamin' with my eyes open
I'd be tossin' and turnin' all night babe

But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab shootin' me a text sayin' "Comin' home soon"
As long as I can bet on ya crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin' sayin' havin' a good time
Out with your girls, girl do what you do
No matter how late
Baby I'll be stayin' up
I can't sleep without you, no
I can't sleep without you, no, no

I bet that DJ'S playin' your song and your carryin' on
Baby I love the thought of that long as I know I'm the one you're comin' home to

But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab shootin' me a text sayin' "Comin' home soon"
As long as I can bet on ya crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin sayin' havin' a good time
Out with your girls, girl do what you do
No matter how late
Baby I'll be stayin' up
I can't sleep without you
Ya no matter how late baby
I'll be stayin' up
I can't sleep without you no

Can't sleep without you
I can't sleep without you

Never thought I would be like this
Just wide awake waitin' on a goodnight kiss
