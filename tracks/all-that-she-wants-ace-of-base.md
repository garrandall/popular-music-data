She leads a lonely life
She leads a lonely life


When she woke up late in the morning light
And the day had just begun
She opened up her eyes and thought
"Oh, what a morning"
It's not a day for work
It's a day for catching tan
Just lying on the beach and having fun
She's going to get you


All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah
(All that she wants)
(All that she wants)


So if you are in sight and the day is right
She's the hunter, you're the fox
The gentle voice that talks to you won't talk forever
It is a night for passion
But the morning means goodbye
Beware of what is flashing in her eyes
She's going to get you


All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah (Is one more baby, yeah)
Ah, ah


All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah (Is one more baby)
All that she wants is another baby (Is one more baby)
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah (Is one more baby, yeah)


All that she wants
All that she wants
