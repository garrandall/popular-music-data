You better
You better come home right now
Don't wanna keep waiting around
For you to make up your mind

Honey, you better read this letter
I ain't gonna wait too long

Yeah, you better
You better stop moving around
Don't wanna keep hearing from friends
That you found somebody new

Honey, you better read this letter
Or I'll find someone better than you

You write me and tell me
You're gonna crack
I believe that you're
Never, never coming back

Well, maybe, baby
That is true
Just how long you think
I'll wait for you

You better, better
Better, better, better
You better take a train right now
A little girl in town is waiting
For me to make up my mind

She wants to know if I'm free
Honey, you better fly to me
I ain't gonna wait too long

Better, better, better, better
Better, better, better, better
Take a train right now
A little girl in town is waiting
For me to make up my mind

She wants to know if I'm free
Honey, you better fly to me
I ain't gonna wait too long

You better, better
Better, better, better
I ain't going away, baby
Come home before it's too late
