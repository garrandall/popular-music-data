There's only one place where we can go
To see freaky Girls doin' shows
Doin' tricks to make us holler
On a giving night, all for a dollar
Silicone breasts, all on their chests
Nothin' like others, but above the rest
They'll do anything to turn us on
Them girls got it goin' on!
(BM) I like big booty and big and Plenty
Girl, you know you've been have by many
So come and be my private dancer
I got some money if that's the answer
I really wanna be with you;
I get hard after seeing you
How hard? Hard like a rock
When you make that Coochie pop!

Pop that Coochie! Heyyy! Pop that Coochie, baby!
Pop that Coochie! Pop, pop that Coochie, baby!

Freaky girls with plenty of Class
Rollin' to the music and shakin' real fast
Bend over backwards, make me shout
And work that body, in and out
Movin' their body with plenty of action
Bringin' to the men more satisfaction
Doin' what they feel to turn us out
Just work that body all the way out!
(BM) Shake it! Don't break it!
It took your momma nine months to make it
Bend over and spread 'em, girl
Show-w-w me those country pearls
Play that button you know real quick
Let me Blow Me A Freaky Kiss
Girl, you know you look so cute
Throwin' that Coochie the way you do!

Poppin' that Thang a dance for the ladies
Straight from the South, into the 90's
Freaky girls are the ones I like
In G-strings in the middle of the night
Smoke-filled stages, women in cages
Guards at the door, armed with gauges
As they dance and I get hot
Keep throwin' that Body! Don't stop!
(BM) I like the way you get the champagne glass
It makes me wanna Blast Off Real Fast
So come on, baby, and pop it quick
I fall in love when you Can't Sit
Girl, you don't know? You ain't heard?
Messin' with me, you're gonna get served
See, none of my Girls, they never complain
So come on, baby, and pop that thang!

Janet J, pop, that Coochie!
Bu-bles, pop, that Coochie!
Ma-donna, pop, that Coochie!
Sandra-P, pop that stinky smelly Coochie, baby!

Breakdown!
