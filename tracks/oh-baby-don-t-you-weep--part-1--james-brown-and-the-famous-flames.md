Sometimes, the going get a little tough now
(Oh, baby, don't you weep)
When the times get hard and the friends get few now
(Oh, baby, don't you weep)
No one to turn to, and nothing to do now
(Oh, baby, don't you weep)
You scream and you holler
(Oh, baby, don't you weep)
'Til your back and is soaking wet now
(Oh, baby, don't you weep)
You still love 'em so much
(Oh, baby, don't you weep)
And still, you can't forget now
(Oh, baby, don't you weep)

You scream and you holler
Your back gets soaking wet
You know that you used to love him
And still, you can't forget
You know sometimes it's hard
Nowhere to go
No one to love
Tried everything you know

And AHH, baby
(Oh, baby, don't you weep)
And AHH, baby
(Oh, baby, don't you weep)
I want you to play
I want you to play a little softer now

(Do doop, doopty doop)
You know, a friend of mine told me one time
(Do doop doopty doop)
I think it was back in 1959
(Do doop doopty doop)
He said, "Darling, you send me"
(Do doop doopty doop)
He said, "If you call me, I'll come running back to you
(Do doop doopty doop)
And another friend of mine told me
He said, "If you need me, call me"
(Do doop doopty doop)
You see, I got a lot of friends in my business
(Do doop doopty doop)
And another friend of mine, he told me
(Do doop doopty doop)
You better stop dogging me around, now
(Do doop doopty doop)
And a recent friend of mine, he came up
(Do doop doopty doop)
And you know what he said? "It's too late"
(Do doop doopty doop)...
