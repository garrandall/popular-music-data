When I'm alone
I sometimes get to thinkin'
How it's gonna be
When we're gone?
Are we movin' closer together

Or is it gonna take for ever and ever
Let it go (let it go)
Let it flow like a river
Let it go
Let it flow through you
Let it go
Let it flow live a river
Let it go
Let it flow through you

Searchin' everywhere just tryin' to find the reason
For misunderstanding and doubt
Don't wanna preach it
Push it or teach it
Just take a good look all around

Or is it gonna take for ever and ever
Let it go (let it go)
Let it go
Let it flow through you
Let it go
Let it flow live a river
Let it go
Let it flow through you

Walls are gonna fall and angel's gonna call on you
To help you on your way
Time spent together like now is forever

So don't ever let love slip away

Or is it gonna take for ever and ever
Let it go (let it go)
Let it go
Let it flow through you
Let it go
Let it flow live a river
Let it go
Let it flow through you
