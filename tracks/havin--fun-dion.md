I know some people with more money than we'll ever see
Ever see someone buy a private island they never see?
Ever see every sea on your own personal yacht?
Take jog around your block that you bought from selling your stock?

Not in this lifetime, some of them my partners
They don't believe in karma, but they believe in commas
And they believe their dollars for a peace of mind
Put a price upon their head and they'd be fine with that fine

'Cause you find when you can buy the park, you hate the rides
It was fun in the beginning, now it seems they not as thrillin'
And you out to make a killin', but it never feels fulfillin'
So, they call me tell me, "Crae, this how I'm feelin'."

Confessions of a millionaire, lifestyle of the famous
There's nothing I can't have, you say it looks so amazing
Well, I would trade it away for my sanity
Confessions of a millionaire

Look, I ain't finna pretend that my car and my crib
Give me worth and meaning 'cause I know they never did
Them numbers in my bank account are no reason for livin'
And sleepin' with bad women really doesn't keep me driven

I'm sure this man sittin' beside me is beside himself
Tryna find himself
Yeah, he flyin' first class thinkin' everyone behind him is a peon
Goin' home to a model chick he probably gon' cheat on

He'll be empty for eons; you know what I be on
Money don't solve it all, man, look what happen to Dion
I bought my dream house, but it only made me wake up
It all falls down even if you got your cake up

Confessions of a millionaire, lifestyle of the famous
There's nothing I can't have, you say it looks so amazing
Well, I would trade it away for my sanity
Confessions of a millionaire

I've flown first class, flown private jets
Rode in foreign cars; still so unimpressed
'Cause after she spent all that money on her chest
She thought it make her life better, but she finds she still depressed

Ain't nothing wrong with havin' it. Matter of fact, go and get it
But if you find identity in it then go and forget it
You gain the whole world but lost the only thing you own
'Cause everything else is just a temporary loan

Confessions of a millionaire, lifestyle of the famous
There's nothing I can't have, you say it looks so amazing
Well, I would trade it away for my sanity
Confessions of a millionaire
