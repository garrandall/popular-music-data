Lipstick pretty face and maybe you'll notice something
Different bout me, different bout me
Yeah, you talk, talk all you want
You pour your heart out
But you never do see, you never do see me
I can't wait around forever for you

Sooner or later
You're gonna come around and you'll be sorry
When you figure out
That I was always everything that you needed
Sooner or later you're gonna wish you had me
Yeah, you're gonna wish you had me

Well, she don't do nothing for you
But mess you up
Yeah, she messes you up
I'm your shoulder, I'm the quick drive over
Tryin' to fix your stuff, well I give up
Oo, you'll never see me standin' right in front of you

Sooner or later
You're gonna come around and you'll be sorry
When you figure out
That I was always everything that you needed
Sooner or later you're gonna wish you had me
Oo, oo
Oh, you're gonna wish me back so bad, so bad
Oh, but its a little too late for that

Lipstick pretty face and maybe you'll notice something
Different bout me, different bout me

Sooner or later
You're gonna come around and you'll be sorry
When you figure out
That I was always everything that you needed
Sooner or later, oh

Sooner or later
You're gonna come around and you'll be sorry
When you figure out
That I was always everything that you needed
Sooner or later
You're gonna wish you had me

Sooner or later, oh
You're gonna wish you had me, yeah
You're gonna wish you had me, oh
You're gonna wish you had me, oh
You're gonna wish you had me
