Cook that shit up, Quay
Baby, huh

Christian Dior on my shoes
They cost a band, I prolly won't wear again
Lil Mizzy just came on the news
I'm thinkin', "Damn, he back in trouble again"
Made me a mil' 'cause I can
I know who I am, and I give thanks to the man
The tiger just jumped out the can
That's my lil' man, right back gettin' action again
That young nigga shit, we still on it
My dawg goin' through it, I feel for him
She told me she love me, I fell for her
Got real niggas sittin' in jail for it
Buy the pack, I'ma put it in the mail for it
On the hunt for the money, I smell for it
I went big dawg on them, this Tom Ford
That lil' boy shit I ain't goin' for it
Gettin' money every day I wake up
Don't ask me, "Did your man and lil' shawty break up?"
Them M's comin' in, let 'em stack up
Don't ride my wave, dawg, back up
I ain't never had shit, I gotta act up
Don't come too close, my dawgs wan' buck
I don't need no help, I don't ask for much
If I ever go broke, we maskin' up

Ran the money up, way up
Life ain't sweet, ain't no lay-up
Drip for sale, they gotta pay us
I stayed down and I came up
Stayed the same and they changed up
I knew they was gon' change up
Money never gon' change us
I just be in my lane stuck

I parked the Bentley inside the garage
I don't know how much head I can dodge
I can get you knocked off with a knot
4 Pockets Full, everyone got a knot
I say this shit from the heart
I knew you weren't real, you weren't there from the start
Anything good in my way came from God
Go get on stage and I get an applause
Damn Young Gunna done growed up
Bent the Bentley coupe, they know it's us
My bro took a loss and I picked him up
We stick together, they ain't rich as us
I wanna sit down, she ain't lit enough
Every time I count cash, swear I get a rush
My money long as the yellow bus
It ain't no secret, I'm livin' plush

Ran the money up, way up
Life ain't sweet, ain't no lay-up
(Cook that shit up, Quay!)
Drip for sale, they gotta pay us
I stayed down and I came up
Stayed the same and they changed up
I knew they was gon' change up
Money never gon' change us
I just be in my lane stuck

Ran the money up, way up
Life ain't sweet, ain't no lay-up
Money never gon' change us
I just be in my lane stuck
Stayed the same and they changed up
I knew they was gon' change up
