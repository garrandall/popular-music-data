I'll drive a million miles
To be with you tonight
So if you're feeling low
Turn up your radio
The words we use are strong
They make reality
But now the music's on
Oh, baby, dance with me, yeah

Rip it up, move down
Rip it up, move it down to the ground
Rip it up, cool down
Rip it up, don't hang me on the borderline

Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody Wang Chung tonight
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody Wang Chung tonight
Everybody have fun

Deep in the world tonight
Our hearts beat safe and sound
I'll hold you so close
Just let yourself go down

Rip it up, move down 
Rip it up, move it down to the ground 
Rip it up, cool down
Rip it up, get out what's inside of you

Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody Wang Chung tonight
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody Wang Chung tonight
Everybody have fun tonight (everybody)
Everybody have fun

On the edge of oblivion
All the word is Babylon
And all the love and everyone 
A ship of fools sailing on

(Everybody)
Everybody have fun tonight
(Everybody)
Everybody have fun tonight

Across the nation, around the world
Everybody have fun tonight
A celebration, so spread the word

Everybody, everyone
Everybody, everyone (can you tell me what a Wang Chung is?)
Everybody, everyone

Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody have fun tonight 
Everybody Wang Chung tonight
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody Wang Chung tonight
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody have fun

Everybody, everyone
Everybody, everyone
Everybody, everyone
Everybody, everyone
