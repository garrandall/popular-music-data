It's too soon to know if I can forget her
My heart's been broken in too many pieces
And It's too soon to know

Time passes slow will I ever know
If I can forget her and not let it show
But it's too soon to know

News travels fast when a love affair ends
People keep asking what happened to them

But it's too soon to know it I can forget her
My heart's been broken in too many pieces
And It's too soon to know
My heart's been broken in too many pieces
And It's too soon to know
