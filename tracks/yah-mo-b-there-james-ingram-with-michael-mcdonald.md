Heavenly Father watchin' us fall
We take from each other and give nothing at all
Well, it's a doggone shame but never too late for change
So, if your luck runs low, just reach out and call His name
His name


Yah Mo B there
Yah Mo B there
Yah Mo B there
Yah Mo B there
Whenever you call


Never be lonely, lost in the night
Just run from the darkness, lookin' for the light
'Cause it's a long hard road that leads to a brighter day
Don't let your heart grow cold, just reach out and call His name
His name


Yah Mo B there
Yah Mo B there
Yah Mo B there
Yah Mo B there
Yah Mo B there (Yah Mo B there)
Yah Mo B there (Whenever you call)
Yah Mo B there (Yeah, yeah)
Yah Mo B there


(Yah will B there) You can count on it brother
'Cause we're all just finding our way
(Travelin' through time) People got to keep pushing on
No matter how many dreams slip away
Yah will B there


Well, it's a doggone shame but never too late for change
So when your luck runs low, just reach out and call His name
Just call His name


Yah Mo B there (Yah B there)
Yah Mo B there (When you need a friend)
Yah Mo B there (There to catch you when you fall)
Yah Mo B there (Hoo!)
Yah Mo B there (Yah B there)
Yah Mo B there (Whenever you call, whenever you call)
Yah Mo B there (Yah, Yah Mo B there)
Yah Mo B there (Yah Mo B right there)


Yah Mo B there (Yah Mo B there)
Yah Mo B there (Oh, right there)
Yah Mo B there (I'll be there)
Yah Mo B there (Just a little bit, whatever you need)
