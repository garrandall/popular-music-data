Well you can talk about your Julie and your Peggy Sue 
You can keep your Miss Molly and your Mary Lou
When it comes to the chicken or to doing the hop
I've got a girl they call the queen of the hop

Well I love my queen
Do you know who I mean
Sweet little sixteen
Yes that's my queen

Well she wears short shorts and rock and roll shoes
Gotta see her dance to the yellow dog blues
She's my sugar time baby
I'm her lollipop
Everybody knows I love my queen of the hop

Well I love my queen
Do you know who I mean
Sweet little sixteen
Yes that's my queen

Well she tunes into bandstand every day
To watch the kids dancing cross the USA
She don't care about a thing except in rock and roll
My baby drives me crazy when she does the stroll

Well she tunes into bandstand every day
To watch the kids dancing cross the USA
She don't care about a thing except in rock and roll
My baby drives me crazy when she does the stroll

Well I love my queen
Do you know who I mean
Sweet little sixteen
Yes that's my queen

Well that's my queen
Yes that's my queen
Well that's my queen...
