Hey, hey, baby
I wanna know
If you'll be my girl

Hey, hey, woman
I wanna know, yeah
If you'll be my girl

Well, when I saw you
Walking down the street
I told myself that's the kind of girl
I'd love to meet

She's so pretty
And, she looks so fine
I just can't wait
I just can't wait
Until I make that swinging girl mine

Hey, hey sweet woman
Come on and turn me on
With your lovin' girl
And be my bundle of joy
Uhm Yeah

Well, when I saw you walking down the street
That's when I've got to say
Hey mama, give me a whirl
I really wanna know
Would you tell me mama
Come on and be mine
Come on girl

Hey, hey, woman
I wanna know
If you'll be my girl
Whoa yeah, If you'll be my girl


Whoa yeah, if you'll be my girl
I want you to tell me right now
I want you to be mine
Come on baby
Come on honey
I want you to be my little baby girl
You know I really love ya and I'll do anything
Come on now honey
You know I really love you cuz I'll  do baby
