"Detroit listeners out there, you better be sure to stop by the 
Galaxy Club where theres a freestyle superfly fresh contest going 
on tonight. If you got the skills you better get your hiphop ass 
on down here, cause we got DJ Clueless on the wheels of steel" 
(The fuck... fucks... trying to freestyle... oh, I'll be down there. 
Yeah, I got something for all these muthafuckas down there. Yeah.) 


Mortification is my next demonstration 
I'd ask you for a light pumping gas at the station 
Heres my situation: I hate many people 
So I hear no evil say no evil just like Kanieval 
Leave you headless, bloody mess 
Like you was ridin a Ducati 
Ladey Dahdey 
Broke every bone in your body, I'm not sorry 
I'll probably murder you, voices tellin me do what he say 
"Kill the DJ! Fuck what he play! Mayday Mayday!" 
BOOM BOOM, blood's all over the room 
I fucked your bitch like a witch with the broom 
Dooms-day, murderers say, 
"All y'all must pay when the buck shots spray!" 
Who wants to challenge me? 
Grab the mic and bust your rap 
But then I'm a just go grab my strap and just commence to bustin caps 
Leaving bodies piled up in freestyle clubs. Fuck! 
You better make room! BOOM like what! 

WHAT? YALL MAKE ROOM WHEN WE SHOW UP BOOM BOOM BOOM 
WHAT WHAT? YALL MAKE ROOM WHEN WE SHOW UP BOOM BOOM BOOM 

Killers run up in this bitch, start bustin off shots 
Hitting mirror balls, lazer lights, and people on the top 
I'm lookin for the DJ 'cause he dont see it my way 
I'm 'bout to blow him out his headphones and spin some abk 
I'm like a Molitove cocktail breaking on your wall 
I'm setting shit off, I'll blow your lid off, your body fall 
You dont need aluminol, I'm leavin blood everywhere 
And I'm aiming for the head and hair of everybody there 
I'm like a grasshopper quick to jump, I'm spreading my wings 
You say the wicked shit'll die, I say you faggots seeing things 
And all you bitches know: I'm gangsta. Dont ask me to dance 
I might straight panic, pull the gat, and blow your pussy out your pants 
It's the wicked shit. It's E and J. It's hotter than Hell 
And every Devil's Night, we hunt them down and slaughter D12 
I take the moosegun and shot your butt and blow it out your back 
Turn and face the camera, "Where your hatches at?" 
Throw em up y'all 

WHAT? YALL MAKE ROOM WHEN WE SHOW UP BOOM BOOM BOOM 
WHAT WHAT? YALL MAKE ROOM WHEN WE SHOW UP BOOM BOOM BOOM 

Make room 
Guess who coming in? 
Grab my gun again 
They told me he was one of them 
So i done him in 
A killer's on the hunt again 
Smoke my blunt again 
Fatality finished him - I won again 
Repentance, my vengence, so I'm not sentenced a hundred years 
It's burning my ears, and blood is mixed with my tears, fears 
My styles gets rid of this, drive-by's and wheelchairs 
All you see is smoke in the air cause we dont care. 

WHAT? YALL MAKE ROOM WHEN WE SHOW UP BOOM BOOM BOOM 
WHAT WHAT? YALL MAKE ROOM WHEN WE SHOW UP BOOM BOOM BOOM
