I've seen you hanging 'round
This darkness where I'm bound
And this black hole I've dug for me
And silently within
With hands touching skin
The shock breaks my disease
And I can breathe


And all of your weight, all you dream
Falls on me, it falls on me
And your beautiful sky, the light you bring
Falls on me, it falls on me


Your faith like the pain
Draws me in again
She washes all my wounds for me
The darkness in my veins
I never could explain
And I wonder if you ever see
Will you still believe


And all of your weight, all you dream
Falls on me, it falls on me
And your beautiful sky, the light you bring
Falls on me, it falls on me


Am I that strong
To carry on?
I might change your life
I might save my world
Could you save me?


And all of your weight, all you dream
Falls on me, it falls on me
And your beautiful sky, the light you bring
Falls on me, it falls on me
