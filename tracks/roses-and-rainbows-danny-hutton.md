If I were a king
I'd give up everything
Just to have you near me 'cause
Roses and rainbows are you

The sky is always blue
Whenever I'm with you
I think I just love you 'cause
Roses and rainbows are you

I love the way you hold my hand
The way you understand
The way you make me feel
Like I'm your man

Way up in the sky
I think I see why
The birds do all their singing 'cause
Roses and rainbows are you
Roses and rainbows are you

Way up in the sky
I think I see why
The birds do all their singing 'cause
Roses and rainbows are you

Roses and rainbows are you
