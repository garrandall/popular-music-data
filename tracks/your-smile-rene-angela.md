Smile
Oh, oh
Smile
Smile


In your eyes shine pictures of
This time for us, I melt with love
When our lips kiss, silent words
Move the earth and shake my world


But nothin' means as much (Your smile)
Like that special touch (Your smile)
From your smile (Your smile)
Oh, if anything I'd miss (Your smile)
I never could resist (Your smile)
Your smile
Oh, oh, oh


In your touch there's tenderness
A sweet caress that soothes all pain
When I'm lost and feelin' low
To you I go to make things right again


But nothin' means as much (Your smile)
Like that special touch (Your smile)
From your smile (Your smile)
If anything I'd miss (Your smile)
How could I resist (Your smile)
Your smile (Your smile)


Baby, smile (Smile)
When you smile (Smile)
Everything's all right (Smile)
When you smile (Smile)
Nothing means as much (Smile)
Nothing seems to touch (Smile)
When you smile (Smile)
You light my life (Smile), baby
(Your smile)
The sun will shine again (Your smile)
When you smile (Your smile)
Oh, hoo, hoo
If anything I'd miss (Your smile)
How could I resist (Your smile)
Your smile (Your smile), oh, oh


No other love can light my life
No one can make things right 'til my baby smiles
You move the earth and shake my world
Oh, I melt with love
No other love can light my life
No one can make things right 'til my baby smiles
A sweet caress and tenderness
The way you light my life
No other love (Your smile) can light my life
No one can make things right (Your smile) 'til my baby smiles
I'm saving all (Your smile), my love for you
No one does for me (Your smile) what you do
No other love (Your smile) can light my life
No one can make things right (Your smile) 'til my baby smiles
When I'm down (Your smile), feeling low
The sun can shine again (Your smile)
No other love (Your smile) can light my life
No one can make things right (Your smile) 'til my baby smiles
(Your smile) Oh, oh (Your smile) woo
No other love (Your smile) can light my life
No one can make things right (Your smile) 'til my baby smiles
