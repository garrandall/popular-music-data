Baby dim the lights
While I pour the wine
Slip the music up nice and slow
Wanna move with u inside a groove
Like no one's ever known
Let your body unwind in the warmth of mine
Tell me what you like
Cause tonight I wanna turn you on to paradise
Sweet thing hold me close
(share my desire)
And we can make the magic flow
Once the music is right

Give me slow jams and hot romance
Rock me with that tender dance
(baby get closer so we can feel the power of love)
Share my sweet groove the whole night through
Let me lay my beat on you
(we'll keep the music playing movin in time)

Let me get a taste of some babyface
And you know it'll be alright
Cause the road that ends at boyz to men
Is the road I wanna ride
We can go to the moon on a stevie tune
Fly ribbons in the sky
Give me everything r. kelly sings Let us bump and grind
Baby feel the beat
(hear in my heart)
Move with me in ecstacy
Let the melody rise yeah yeah

Give me slow jams and hot romance
Rock me in that tender dance
(I wanna feel the passion so give me all you got)
Share my sweet groove the whole night through
Make tonight a dream come true
(let's keep this groove thing going never never never let it stop)

(babyface)
There's something that feels so right
Deep inside of your rhythm
(baby tonight's your nite)

When I feel your beat inside my soul
(it's a do me groove I know I) can't control

Sweet thing hold me close
(share my desire)
(babyface)
We can make the magic flow
Once the music is right

Give me slow jams and hot romance
Rock me with that tender dance
(I wanna feel the passion so give me all you got)
Share my sweet groove the whole night through
(let me lay my beat on you)
Let's keep this good thing going Move in time with something good
