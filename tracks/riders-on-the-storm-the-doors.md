Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Into this house we're born
Into this world we're thrown
Like a dog without a bone, an actor out on loan
Riders on the storm


There's a killer on the road
His brain is squirmin' like a toad
Take a long holiday
Let your children play
If you give this man a ride, sweet family will die
Killer on the road


Girl you gotta love your man
Girl you gotta love your man
Take him by the hand
Make him understand
The world on you depends, our life will never end
Gotta love your man


Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Into this house we're born
Into this world we're thrown
Like a dog without a bone, an actor out on loan
Riders on the storm


Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
