They came at night leaving fear behind
Shadows were on the ground
Nobody knew where to find him
No evidence was found
"I'm never coming back"
They heard him cry
And I believe him
Well he never meant to do anything wrong
It's gonna get worse if he waits too long


Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
Because you're not anywhere
That I can find you
Oh now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
Because you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh no


Searching through the day and into the night
They wouldn't stop till they found him
They didn't know him and they didn't understand
They never asked him why
"Get out of my way"
They heard him shout
Then a blinding light
Oh all I could see was him running down the street
Out of the shadows and into the night




Don't give up
Keep running, keep hiding
Don't give up
Billy, if you know you're right
Don't give up
You know that I am on your side
Don't give up
Oh Billy, you better, you better, you better run for your life

They came at night leaving fear behind
Shadows were on the ground
Nobody knew where to find him
No evidence was found
"I'm never coming back"
They heard him cry
And I believe him
He never meant to do anything wrong
It's gonna get worse if he waits too long


Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
Because you're not anywhere
That I can find you, oh
Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
Because you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh
