Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah


Champagne with breakfast while I'm yawning
You can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning
Lord forgive me, I can't take things slowly (Slow)
I'm gone on them once I get going (Gone on them, oh, gone on them)


She tryna take it all off for me
Tryna stay real close to me (Close)
I gotta catch myself
I can't play myself, I need to take it


Easy, easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy


Railiza, you need a... money and visa
And you get what you want, always from me
I can't say "No" when you say "Please," I can't say "No"
Howisha, you need a... baby with me, uh
And I'm takin' my time, just wait, don't leave
I can't say "No" when you say "Please," I can't say "No"
You wanna drink like Bajan and dance like Trini, yeah
You want a supermodel pose like mi real friend Winnie (Like mi real friend)
Yeah, vacation is done but I'm not finished, no


Champagne with breakfast while I'm yawning
You can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning
Lord forgive me, I can't take things slowly (Slow)
I'm gone on them once I get going (Gone on them, gone on them, gone on them)


She tryna take it all off for me (Close)
Tryna stay real close to me
I gotta catch myself
I can't play myself, I need to take it


Easy, easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy


I stay to myself, I'll explain myself, I can't play myself
Oh, first night, holy night, five in the morning, yeah-yeah (Yeah)
And it feels like you're mine, signs of the times, oh, what a time
Playin' it right, playin' it perfect
Laughin' it off, but I know you're hurtin'
Signs of the times, I say all the time
Taking my time, just gets harder to find it
But you're playin' it right, you're playin' me perfect


She tryna take it all off for me
Tryna stay real close to me
I gotta catch myself
I can't play myself, I need to take it


Easy, easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy


I bet I never disrespect you, darlin'
I bet you pardon me, darlin'
