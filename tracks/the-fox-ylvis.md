Dog goes woof, cat goes meow
Bird goes tweet, and mouse goes squeak
Cow goes moo. Frog goes croak, and the elephant goes toot
Ducks say quack and fish go blub, and the seal goes ow ow ow
But there's one sound that no one knows...
What does the fox say?

Ring-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!
Gering-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!
Gering-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!
What the fox say?
Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow!
Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow!
Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow!
What the fox say?
Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho!
Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho!
Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho!
What the fox say?
Joff-tchoff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff!
Joff-tchoff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff!
Joff-tchoff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff!
What the fox say?

Big blue eyes, pointy nose, chasing mice, and digging holes
Tiny paws, up the hill, suddenly you're standing still

Your fur is red, so beautiful, like an angel in disguise
But if you meet a friendly horse, will you communicate by mo-o-o-o-orse, mo-o-o-o-orse, mo-o-o-o-orse?
How will you speak to that h-o-o-orse, h-o-o-orse, h-o-o-orse?
What does the fox say?!

Jacha-chacha-chacha-chow!
Jacha-chacha-chacha-chow!
Jacha-chacha-chacha-chow!
What the fox say?
Fraka-kaka-kaka-kaka-kow!
Fraka-kaka-kaka-kaka-kow!
Fraka-kaka-kaka-kaka-kow!
What the fox say?
A-hee-ahee ha-hee!
A-hee-ahee ha-hee!
A-hee-ahee ha-hee!
What the fox say?
A-oo-oo-oo-oo!
Woo-oo-oo-oo!
What does the fox say?!

The secret of the fox, ancient mystery
Somewhere deep in the woods, I know you're hiding
What is your sound? Will we ever know?
Will always be a mystery what do you say?

You're my guardian angel hiding in the woods
What is your sound?
A-bubu-duh-bubu-dwee-dum a-bubu-duh-bubu-dwee-dum
Will we ever know?
A-bubu-duh-bubu-dwee-dum
I want to, I want to, I want to know!
A-bubu-duh-bubu-dwee-dum
Bay-buh-day bum-bum bay-dum
