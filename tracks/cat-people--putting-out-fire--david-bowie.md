See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the moon

Well, it's been so long
And I've been putting out fire with gasoline

See these eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds and change their minds

It's been so long

Still this pulsing night
A plague I call a heartbeat
Just be still with me
But you wouldn't believe what I've been through

You've been so long
Well it's been so long
I've been putting out fire with gasoline
Putting out fire with gasoline

See these tears so blue
An ageless heart that can never mend
These tears can never dry
A judgement made can never bend

See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Just be still with me
You wouldn't believe what I've been through

Well, you've been so long
That's been so long
And I've been putting out fire with gasoline
Putting out fire with gasoline

Putting out fire
I've been putting out fire

Well, it's been so long, so long, so long
Yes it's been so long, so long, so long
I've been putting out fire
Been so long, so long, so long
Well I've been putting out fire
Been so long so long so long
I've been putting out fire
Been so long so long so long
And I've been putting out fire
Been so long so long so long
And I've been putting out fire
Been so long so long so long
Putting out fire
Been so long so long so long

It's been so long
Been so long so long so long
It's been so long
Been so long so long so long
Well, I've been putting out fire
Been so long so long so long
Well, I've been putting out fire
Been so long so long so long
