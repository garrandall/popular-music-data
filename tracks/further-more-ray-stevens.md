Well, go away and leave me all alone and blue
And never come back to me 'cause I'm through with you
'Cause baby, now that you have done me wrong it's plain to see
That you no longer want to bother me
I'm sick and tired of all your lying and your cheating
And the way that you have been mistreating me
And lemme tell you friend that you will never get the chance to break my heart again
And furthermore
Yes, furthermore
And on top of that
I don't love you anyway

Well, you told me that you'd always love me, treat me fair
But lately, baby, seems like you don't even care about me anymore
You closed the door on me
And left me blue as I can be
And I'm not gonna take it anymore
And be your fool again, like I was before
'Cause baby this is it, I quit
You can just forget that we ever met
And furthermore
Yes, furthermore
And in addition to that
I don't love you anyway

No, baby (baby)
I don't love you anyway (love you anyway)
At least (at least)
At least that's what I say
While (all the while)
All the while, all the while I'm trying to hide (trying to hide)
Tears, tears, tears
That I feel deep inside

So, go away and leave me all alone and blue
And never come back to me 'cause I'm through with you
'Cause baby, now that you have done me wrong it's plain to see
That you no longer want to bother me
I'm sick and tired of all your lying and your cheating
And the way that you have been mistreating me
And lemme tell you friend that you will never get the chance to break my heart again
And furthermore
Yes, furthermore
And on top of that
I don't love you anyway
