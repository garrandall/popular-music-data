Tonight, tonight, won't be just any night
Tonight there will be no morning star

Tonight, tonight, I'll see my love tonight
And for us, stars will stop where they are

Today, the minutes seem like hours
The hours go so slowly
And still the sky is light

Oh moon, grow bright and make this endless day
Endless night, tonight

Today, the world was just an adress
A place for me to live in
No better than all right.

But here you are, and what was just a world
Is a star, tonight
