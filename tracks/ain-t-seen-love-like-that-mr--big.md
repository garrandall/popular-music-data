I've been miles from nowhere crossed and doubled back
Time is a healer and I've done my time
'Cause I ain't seen love like that

I've seen the light of freedom 'til they fade to black
So many faces but no one compares
No I ain't seen love like that

And I've got
People tellin' me to let her go
Don't let it turn you around
Tomorrow's comin' and you'll never know
The one that you lost may be found

I believe in justice
I wonder where she's at
It feels like a lifetime and it just ain't fair
No I ain't seen love like that

And I've got
People tellin' me to let her go
That girl is bringing you down
Tomorrow's comin' and you'll never know
The love that you lost may be found

Whooh

You know there's
People tellin' me to let her go
Don't let it turn you around
Tomorrow's comin' and you'll never know
The love that you lost may be found

I've been miles from nowhere
Crossed and doubled back
Time is a healer And I've done my time
No, I ain't seen love like that
No, I ain't seen love like that
So many faces, (ain't seen love like that)
No one compares
I ain't seen love like that (ain't seen love like that)
Ain't seen love (ain't seen love like that)
No I ain't
