Once a girl I knew, all alone and unprepared.
Everyone she knew, running scared.
Then she found him or maybe he found her.
His were gentle words she had never heard before.

He said, "Lisa, listen to me,
Don't you know where you belong?
Darling, Lisa, you can tell me
You've been silent for too long."

Once another man took her on a younger day,
All a young girl can do is pray.
Then she found him or maybe he found her.
His were gentle words she had never heard before.
She had never heard before.

He said, "Lisa, listen to me,
Don't you know where you belong?
Darling, Lisa, you can tell me...
You've been silent for too long."

He said, "Lisa, listen to me,
Don't you know where you belong?
Darling, Lisa, you can tell me...
You've been silent for too long."

Once a girl I knew, all alone and unprepared.
Everyone she knew, running scared.
Then she found him or maybe he found her.
His were gentle words she had never heard before.
She had never heard before
