What a girl wants, what a girl needs.
Yeah, come on.

I wanna thank you for giving me time to breathe
Like a rock you waited so patiently
While I got it together
While I figured it out, yeah yeah
I only looked but I never touched
'Cause in my heart was a picture of us
Holdin' hands, makin' plans and it's lucky for me you understand

What a girl wants
What a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly
What a girl wants
What a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thanking you for giving it to me
Yeah Yeah

What I want is what you got
And what you got, is what I want.

There was a time I was blind, I was so confused
Run away just to hide it all from you.
But baby, you knew me better than I knew myself
They say if you love something let it go
If it comes back it's yours
That's how you know
It's for keeps, yeah, it's for sure
And you're ready and willin'
To give me more than

What a girl wants
What a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly
What a girl wants
What a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thanking you for giving it to me
Yeah Yeah

What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Somebody sensitive, courageous,
Sexy, cool, like you.
What a girl wants, what a girl needs, oh yeah.

What a girl wants (you're so right)
What a girl needs (you're so right)
You let a girl know how much you
Care about her, I swear
You're the one who always knew
You knew, you knew, you knew, you knew

Oh, I'm thanking you for being there for me.
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms,
Whatever keeps me in your arms, that's what I need...

What a girl wants
What a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly
What a girl wants
What a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thanking you for being there for me
Yeah Yeah
