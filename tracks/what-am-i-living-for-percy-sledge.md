What am I living for 
If not for you 
What am I living for 
If not for you 
What am I living for 
If not for you 
Ohhhh, nobody else 
Nobody else will do 

What am I longing for 
Each lonely night 
To feel your lips with mine 
And hold you tight 
You'll be my little girl 
My whole life through 
Baby, nobody else (nobody) 
Nobody else will do 

I want you close to me 
That's all I know 
I want you all the time 
Cause darling I love you so 

What am I living for 
If not for you 
What am I living for 
If not for you 
What am I living for 
If not for you 
Ohhh, nobody else (nobody) 
Nobody else will do 
Ohhh, nobody else (nobody) 
Nobody else will do 

Baby, nobody else 
Nobody else will do
