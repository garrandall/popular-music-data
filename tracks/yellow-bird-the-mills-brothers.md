Pd... Yellow bird, up high in banana tree
Yellow bird, you sit all alone like me
Did your lady friend leave your nest again?
That is very sad, makes me feel so bad
You can fly away, in the sky away
You're more lucky than me

Pd... I also had a pretty girl
She's not with me today
They're all de same, the pretty girls
Take tenderness, then they fly away

Pd... Yellow bird, up high in banana tree
Yellow bird, you sit all alone like me
Let her fly away, in the sky away
Pick a town and, soon, pick from night to noon
Black and yellow, you like banana too
They might pick you someday

Pd... Wish that I were a yellow bird
I'd fly away with you
But I am not a yellow bird
So here I sit, nothin' else to do

Pd... Yellow bird
Yellow bird
Yellow bird
(FADE)
Yellow bird ...Pd
...Pd...
