James Dean, James Dean 
I know just what you mean 
James Dean, you said it all so clean 
And I know my life would look allright 
If I could see it on the silver screen 

You were the lowdown rebel if there ever was 
Even if you had no cause 
James Dean, you said it all so clean 
And I know my life would look all right 
If I could see it on the silver screen 

We'll talk about a low-down bad refrigerator, 
You were just too cool for school 
Sock hop, soda pop, basketball and auto shop, 
The only thing that got you off was breakin' all the rules 
James Dean, James Dean 
So hungry and so lean 
James Dean, you said it all so clean 
And I know my life would look all right 
If I could see it on the silver screen 

Little James Dean, up on the screen 
Wond'rin' who he might be 
Along came a Spyder and picked up a rider 
And took him down the road to eternity 

James Dean, James Dean, you bought it sight unseen 

You were too fast to live, too young to die, bye-bye 
You were to fast to live, too young to die, bye-bye 
Bye-bye, Bye-bye, Bye-bye, Bye, bye
