Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts
Every night I cry
Every night I sigh
Every night I wonder why
You treat me cold
But I can't let you go

Every little hurt counts
Every little hurt counts
Say you're coming home
But you never phone
Leave me all alone
My love is strong for you
I would do wrong for you

I can't take this loneliness
You're giving me
I Can't go on
Giving my life away

Come back to me
Darling you'll see
I can give you all the things
That you wanted before
If you'll stay

Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts
Every night I cry
Every night I sigh
Every night I wonder why
You hurt me
Desert me

I can't take this loneliness
You're giving me
I can't go on
Giving my life away

Come back to me
Darling you'll see
I can give you all the things
That you wanted before
If you'll stay

Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts
Every night I cry
Every night I sigh
Every night I wonder why
You treat me cold
But I can't let you go

Every little bit hurts
Every little bit
