Would you fuck me for free?
Another one
We the Best Music! Major Key! DJ Khaled!


I go on and on
Can't understand how I last so long
I must have the superpowers
Last 223 thousand hours
It's cause I'm off of CC
And I'm off the Hennessy
And like your boy from Compton said
You know this dick ain't free!
I got girls that I shoulda made pay for it
Got girls that I shoulda made wait for it
Got girls that'll cancel a flight back home
Stay another day for it
You got attitude on na na
And your pussy on agua
And your stomach on flat flat
And your ass on what's that?
And, yeah, I need it all right now
Last year I had drama, girl not right now
I was never gon' chat what we talkin' about
You the only one I know could fit it all in her... man


I always wonder if you ask yourself
Is it just me?
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?
Is it just me?
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to...


Fuck for free
I know you workin' day and night to get a college degree
Bet nobody that you've been with even know you a freak, right?
You know you only do that with me, right?
Yeah, double checkin' on you
You know I never put the pressure on you
You know that you make your own mind up
You knew what it was when you signed up
Now you gotta run it up
I be out of words, tryna sum it up
Girl you throw it back like one love
Even let me smash on the tour bus
Yeah I talk to her but she don't do enough
Even though you in the hood I'm still pullin' up
Dip, dip, straight to your doorstep
This the real thing, can you feel the force yet


I always wonder if you ask yourself
Is it just me?
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?
Is it just me?
Yeah, is it just me?
Is this sex so good I shouldn't have to...
Would you fuck me for free?


Another one
They don't want me to have another anthem
So I made sure I got another anthem
It's We The Best OVO
Summers ours
It always has been
Don't ever play yourself
One time for Future the Prince
One time for 40
One time for Drake
Another one
Bless up
