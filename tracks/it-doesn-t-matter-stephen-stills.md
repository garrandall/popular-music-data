(does it? No. Thank you, I was beginning to worry)
Fallin' and spinnin'
Losin' and winnin'
Keepin' my head
Watchin' for signals
Wearisome vigil (??? That's what Stevie wrote!)
Was I misled
I remember you said that you
Don't want to forget me
It doesn't matter
Which of our fantasies fled
Every tomorrow
Lookin' to borrow
A piece of today
Run a bit faster
Here comes the catcher
Makin' his play
You had better not stay
You will soon be surrounded
It doesn't matter
Which of our fantasies stay
Lonely and winsome
Calling for someone
Living right now
Something is shallow
Ugly and hollow
Doesn't even allow
You to want to know how you might
Live for the living and
Give for the giving. Living
Moment by moment
One day at a time
It doesn't matter
It's nothin' but dreamin' any how
