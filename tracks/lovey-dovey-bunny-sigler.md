Well, you're the sweetest thing
That I have ever seen
I really love your peaches
Got to shake your tree

Lovey dovey, ha
Lovey dovey all the time
Yeah, uh, lovey dovey
Can't get you out of my mind, yeah

I sigh with the feeling
When you are near me
I'm high as a celing
Oh, baby, hear me

'Cause I say that I love you
No one above you
Give it up, pretty mama

You're so fine

By my side, yeah

Well, I walk (I walk)
And I talk (I talk)

Got, got, got, got to get it, baby

Well, you're the sweetest thing
That I have ever seen
I really love your peaches
Got to shake your tree
