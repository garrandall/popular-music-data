You're So Incredible
Ever Since The Day We Became, We Became. So Personal
Everyday That I Spend With You It Gets. Unforgettable
Anything That I Did With You, I Don't. Regret At All
(I Love Everything About You)
Take Away, Your Gold And Platinum Chains
(And I'm Gonna Love You Baby)
Cause I'm Gon' Love, Love You Anyway
(I Ain't In It For The Cheddar Baby)
I'm Not In It For, For The Love Of Cash
(Oh No No, You Might Go Broke, But I'm)
Cause If You Go Broke, I Gotta Make It Last
(Not Goin Nowhere, Nowhere, Nowhere.)
[Ginuwine
Listen, Let's Make, It National
I Want The Whole World To Know
I'm With You, And I'm. In Love
Ain't No Girl In This World
Can Fill Your Shoes, None Not At All
The Things You Do For Me Is So. Unbelievable
And You Can Take Away All The Platinum Chains
[Missy
] + (Ginuwine)

I Just Wanna Be The Perfect Match
You Don't Even Have To Ask.
