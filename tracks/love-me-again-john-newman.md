Know I've done wrong
Left your heart torn
Is that what devils do?
Took you so long
Where only fools go
I shook the angel in you

Now I'm rising from the ground
Rising up to you
Filled with all the strength I found
There's nothing I can't do

I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can't you love me again?

Love me again

It's unforgivable
I stole and burnt your soul
Is that what demons do?
They rule the worst of me
Destroy everything
They bring down angels like you

Now I'm rising from the ground
Rising up to you
Filled with all the strength I found
There's nothing I can't do

Alright!

I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?

Love me again
Oh, love me again
You love me again

Whoa
Told you once again
Do this again
Do this again, oh, Lord
Told you once again
Do this again
Do this again, oh, Lord

I need to know now, know now
Can youâcan you love me again?

I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can youâcan you love me again?

Love me again

Oh, can you love me again?

Whoa! You love me again
