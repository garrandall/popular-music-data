My balloon is going up
(My balloon is going up)

All the time we've been going together
Girl, I been in a daze
Now all I need is sunny weather
And I'll have it made

Oh, I thought I was your only fella
But now I've got to go far away
And try my best to forget ya

My balloon is going up
(My balloon is going up)
I'm gonna see the world
Find another girl

First, I'm gonna do some of the things
I wouldn't do when you're around
Then I'll find those smiling faces
You would always give a frown

I'm gonna try to meet the
Kind of girl who can be trusted
And then I'll come back down to Earth
Cause my balloon will be busted

My balloon is going up
(My balloon is going up)
I'm gonna see the world
Find another girl

I'm gonna try to meet the
Kind of girl who can be trusted
And then I'll come back down to Earth
Cause my balloon will be busted

My balloon is going up
(My balloon is going up)
I'm gonna see the world
Find another girl

Yes, my balloon is going up
My balloon is going up
(My balloon is going up)...
