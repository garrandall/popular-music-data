Something about you 
Makes me want to keep on loving you
When I'm without you
I feel I need you back in my heart

I get a sensation
I feel whenever I'm around you
You're my inspiration 
And I'm so glad I found you

One in a million, baby you're the one
One in a million, and you're second to none
One in a million, a million to one
You're one in a million

When I first saw you 
I had a feeling right from the start
In love I was falling
You seemed to do things to my heart

Your love and affection
Is all I need to keep me satisfied,
You leave an impression 
And baby I never want to leave you

One in a million, baby you're the one
One in a million, and you're second to none
One in a million, a million to one
You're one in a million

Something about you 
Makes me want to keep on loving you
When I'm without you
I feel I need you back in my heart

I get a sensation
I feel whenever I'm around you
You're my inspiration 
And I'm so glad I found you

One in a million, baby you're the one
One in a million, and you're second to none
One in a million, a million to one
You're one in a million

You're one in a million
One in a million and you're second to none
One in a million, WOW! one in a million
Baby you know you are one
