I'll write myself a simple song
Get the whole world to sing along
I'll call it a love song for you

And who knows
I'm liable to take a song from the Bible
And then when I'm through, I'll just sing

Love lifted me, love lifted me
When nothing else would do
You know love lifted me

Everybody's looking for a way
To say something nobody said
But that's hard to do

They're searching their mind
Trying to find the one of a kind way
That they could say something new and I just say

Love lifted me, love lifted me
When I was down and out
You know love lifted me

Love lifted me, love lifted me
When nothing else would do
You know love lifted me

Love lifted me, love lifted me
When nothing else would do
You know love lifted me

Love lifted me, love lifted me
When I was down and out
You know love lifted me

Everybody sing love lifted me
Oh, love lifted me
