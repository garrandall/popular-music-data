I've been here before
But always hit the floor
I've spent a lifetime runnin'
And I always get away
But with you I'm feeling something
That makes me want to stay
I'm prepared for this
I never shoot to miss
But I feel like a storm is coming
If I'm gonna make it through the day
Then there's no more use in runnin'
This is something I gotta face


If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?


How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
Cause the writing's on the wall


A million shards of glass
That haunt me from my past
As the stars begin to gather
And the light begins to fade
When all hope begins to shatter
Know that I won't be afraid


If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?


How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love, run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
Cause the writing's on the wall


The writing's on the wall


How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love, run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
Cause the writing's on the wall
