Mary, have you seen better days?
And will you find different ways?
And does he really mean that much to your heart?
Carry, all of the weight you can, find another man
And lead him directly there to the source
You've got to chart his course

'Cause it is only in your heart
This thing that makes you want to
Start it all again
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)

Wake up from an elusive dream
You've got to change the scene
It's getting so hard to see to the end
Break down, all of the walls you can
You need a helping hand
I'm sure there's someone there just for you
He's trying to make it, too

'Cause it is only in your heart
This thing that makes you want to
Start it all again
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)

Only in your heart
This thing that makes you want to
Start it all again
(La, la, la, la)

You can't disregard your friends
But life gets so hard when you reach the end

Mary, have you seen better days?
(Mary, have you seen better days?)
Mary, have you seen better days?
(Mary, have you seen better days?)
Mary, have you seen better days?
(Mary, have you seen better days?)
Mary, have you seen better days?
(Mary, have you seen better days?)
