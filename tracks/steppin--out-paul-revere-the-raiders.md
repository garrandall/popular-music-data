Yeah!
Well, I had to leave town because of Uncle Sam's deal, ha ha ha yeah
Well, I guess my good lovin' done lost its appeal
Because when I come back I heard the bad bad news
They say our big romance has been gettin' abused
Now tell me true, don't lie to me
Have you been step, step, step, step, step, step, steppin' out on me?
I've got ways of findin' out if you've been steppin' out on me
It'll do me good and I'll give you a piece of my mind

I told you once, I told you twice
Stop your cattin' around or else I'll put you on ice
I'm tellin' you baby what I want you to do
Stop your messin' 'round, I'm gonna step out on you
Hey! Hey! Hey hey hey!

If I can't be your one & only man
Well I'm goin' to your dad and give him back your hand yeah
Then I'll call the preacher, tell the choir stay home
Ha I guess you're the kind of woman that's just bound to roam
Now tell me true, don't lie to me
Have you been step, step, step, step, step, step, steppin' out on me?
Tell the truth, child; you've been steppin' out on me
I gotta know in my heart if you've been steppin' out on me
I'll be checkin' with all your friends if you've been steppin' out on me
Better tell me the truth honey; have you been steppin' out on me?
Yeah I'm gonna check; no more stuff or I'll be steppin' out on you
(more talk, fading out)
