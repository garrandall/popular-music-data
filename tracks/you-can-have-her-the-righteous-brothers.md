You can have her, I don't want her
She didn't love me anyway
She only wanted someone to play with
But all I wanted was a love to stay


The girl I loved, she up and left me
She ran away with my best friend
She comes home at night, a just one full hour
When daylight comes, oh no, she's a gone again


You can have her, I don't want her
She didn't love me anyway
She only wanted someone to play with
But all I wanted was a love to stay


Life without love is mighty empty yeah, but confession
Do ya know, do ya know confession good for your soul, baby?
I'd rather have love that I can cling to
Than I had the world and all of its gold


You can have her, I don't want her
She didn't love me anyway
She only wanted someone to play with
But all I wanted was a love to stay


You can have her, I don't want her
She didn't love me anyway
