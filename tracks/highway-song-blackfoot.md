Well, another day, another dollar
After I've sang and hollered
Oh, it's my way of living, and I can't change a thing
Another town is drawing near
Oh, baby, I wish you were here
But the only way I can see you, darlin', is in my dreams
It's a highway song
You sing it on and on
On and on

Well, the hurt you leave behind
It's the hurt that's on your mind
Oh, and last night's show took its toll on me
Well the city lights fly by me
As I lay my body in my bed
Oh, and dreams of you dance through my head
It's a highway song
You sing it on and on
On and on
Highway song
Is as lonely
As the road I'm on

Oh
Oh
Oh

It's those big wheels are ready to roll
We've be flyin' high and so low
Lord, and all this madness, ain't crazy as it seems
Everywhere they stop and stare
I'm just a stranger on this road
Oh, I stand alone
Only in my dream

Highway song
You sing it on and on
On and on
Highway song
Is as lonely
As the road I'm on
(Well, highway song)
Highway song
You sing it on and on
On and on
Highway song
Is as lonely
As the road I'm on
