Spring affair

Oh something's coming over me
Oh I think it's got a hold on me, it's got me, it's got me

Oh just the man I hoped you'd be
Oh just the man to set me free, you got me, you got me
You got me, you got me

Spring affair, spring affair, spring affair
And I'm hung on you
Spring affair, spring affair, spring affair
And we've got something new, me and you, oh baby

Oh guess I'm falling much too fast
Oh I hope this love is gonna last, I've fallen

Oh the feeling's getting really strong
Oh gives me strength to carry on, I've fallen, I've fallen

Spring affair, spring affair, spring affair
And I'm hung up on you
Spring affair, spring affair, spring affair
And we've got something new

It's a spring affair
It's a spring affair

Oh, oh, oh

Spring affair, spring affair, spring affair
And I'm hung up on you
Spring affair, spring affair, spring affair
And we've got something new

Uuuh uhh ah,.. oh yeah...

Oh you're the sunshine in my life
Oh how you come on shining bright, you got me

Oh feeling's gonna grow and grow
Oh let your loving river flow, you got me, you got all of me

Spring affair, spring affair, spring affair
And I'm hung up on you
Spring affair, spring affair, spring affair
And we've got something new
Spring affair, spring affair, spring affair
And we've got something new

It's a spring affair
It's a spring affair

Spring affair
Give strength to carry on
Spring affair...
