When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home
When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home

Oh, when them cotton balls get rotten
You can't pick very much cotton
In them old cotton fields back home
It was down in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
And them old cotton fields back home

It may sound a little funny
But you didn't make very much money
In them old cotton fields back home
It may sound a little funny
But you didn't make very much money
In them old cotton fields back home

Oh, when them cotton balls get rotten
You can't pick very much cotton
In them old cotton fields back home
It was down in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
And them old cotton fields back home

When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home
When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home
In them old cotton fields back home
