Woah, oh-oh,
I had a one-way love.
Woah, oh-oh,
It's what I'm thinkin' of.

Woah, oh-oh,
Woah, oh-oh,

All that love and affection,
I've been giving away,
Have found another direction,
Because I found out today.

My... My baby's baby,
(You gotta tell me baby)
My... My baby's baby,
(You gotta tell me baby)

Woah, oh-oh,
I got no guarantee,
Woah, oh-oh,
You never notice me.
Woah, oh-oh,
Woah, oh-oh,
You should see me now

When he needs a lover,
His baby plays on his mind.
He rings that telephone number,
And guess who's on the line?

Ah, my baby's baby.
(Gotta tell me baby)
My... My baby's baby.
(Gotta love me, gotta love me)
Ah, my baby's baby.
(Gotta tell me baby)
I... Really love to love.

My... My baby's baby.
(Gotta tell me baby)
My... My baby's baby.
(Gotta love me, gotta love me)
Ah, my baby's baby.
(Gotta tell me baby)
I... Really love to love.

My... My baby's baby.
My... My baby's baby.
Oh my... My baby's baby.
I... Really love to love.
