This your boy Soulja Boy tell'em
This girl says she got a donk
She's about to make her hips swing all night long
O na na O na na O na na O na na


Oh shit, shake that ass ma, move it like a gypsy
Stop, woah, back it up, now let me see your hips SWING
Stop, woah, back it up, now let me see your hips SWING
Now drop it looooow and let me see your hips SWING
Down to the floooor now let me see your hips SWING
Down to the floooor now let me see your hips SWING


Uh oh, lean back, girl you got some mean racks
You got a mean ass and I really mean that
But can't you see, that I need a girl, that can move
Make her hips SWING - and - look - just like you
But come to think about it, I think this club is crowded
It's kinda hard to do your thing when everyone's surrounding
So let me form a circle everybody step back
I heard somebody yell "Savage where the chorus at?!"


Oh shit, shake that ass ma, move it like a gypsy
Stop, woah, back it up, now let me see your hips SWING
Stop, woah, back it up, now let me see your hips SWING
Now drop it looooow and let me see your hips SWING
Down to the floooor now let me see your hips SWING
Now drop it looooow and let me see your hips SWING
Down to the floooor now let me see your hips SWING


O na na O na na thats what I said when I hit the door
She got a donk yo shake it shake it on the floor
Get low bounce high swing your hips with it
Hit this split look back get it get it get it
Back it up back it up go on do that thur
(yuuua) I like that let me pull your hurr
(yuuua) I hear my drain low and she got straight low
And the club don't close till I say so


Oh shit, shake that ass ma, move it like a gypsy
Stop, woah, back it up, now let me see your hips SWING
Stop, woah, back it up, now let me see your hips SWING
Now drop it looooow and let me see your hips SWING
Down to the floooor now let me see your hips SWING
Now drop it looooow and let me see your hips SWING
Down to the floooor now let me see your hips SWING


Knees bent, ass out, come on push your ass out
(Let me see your hips swing)
Bring it up then back down, bring it up then back down
(Let me see your hips swing)
All my ladies on the floor, all my ladies on the floor
(Let me see your hips swing)
Pick it up then dip it low, pick it up then dip it low
(Let me see your hips swing)


Knees bent, ass out, come on push your ass out
(Let me see your hips swing)
Bring it up then back down, bring it up then back down
(Let me see your hips swing)
All my ladies on the floor, all my ladies on the floor
(Let me see your hips swing)
Pick it up then dip it low, pick it up then dip it low
(Let me see your hips swing)


Oh shit, shake that ass ma, move it like a gypsy
Stop, woah, back it up, now let me see your hips SWING
Stop, woah, back it up, now let me see your hips SWING
Now drop it looooow and let me see your hips SWING
Down to the floooor now let me see your hips SWING
Now drop it looooow and let me see your hips SWING
Down to the floooor now let me see your hips SWING



Uh oh, let it pop, ladies drop it like it's hot
Hell yeah, that's the spot, now bring it back to the top
Stop! Woah, now back it up, now back it up
Let it rise then watch it dump, shaking your junk in the trunk
And - I - like - the way you move it smoothly
Now why - don't - you move that booty - to - me
I'm tryna come up with some thoughts of attack
Until I heard somebody yellin' out "Savage where the chorus at?!"
