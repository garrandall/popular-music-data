I rolled out this morning...kids had the morning news show on 
Bryant Gumbel was talking about the fighting in Lebanon 
Some senator was squawking about the bad economy 
It's gonna get worse you see we need a change in policy 

There's a local paper rolled up in a rubber band 
One more sad story's one more than I can stand 
Just once, how I'd like to see the headline say
Not much to print today can't find nothing bad to say

Because...

Nobody robbed a liquor store on the lower part of town 
Nobody OD'd, nobody burned a single building down 
Nobody fired a shot in anger...nobody had to die in vain 
We sure could use a little good news today 

I'll come home this evening...I'll bet that the news will be the same 
Somebody takes a hostage...somebody steals a plane 
How I wanna hear the anchor man talk about a county fair 
And how we cleaned up the air...how everybody learned to care 

Whoa, tell me...

Nobody was assassinated in the whole Third World today 
And in the streets of Ireland all the children had to do was play 
And everybody loves everybody in the good old USA 
We sure could use a little good news today 

Nobody robbed a liquor store on the lower part of town 
Nobody OD'd, nobody burned a single building down  
Nobody fired a shot in anger...nobody had to die in vain 
We sure could use a little good news today
