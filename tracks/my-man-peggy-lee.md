It cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got
It's my man

Cold and wet
Tired, you bet
But All that I'll soon forget
With my man

He's not much for looks
And no hero out of books
He's my man

Two or three girls
Has he
That he likes as well as me
But I love him

I don't know why I should
He isn't good
He isn't good
He beats me, too
What can I do?

Oh, my man, I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just a spare
But I don't care
When he takes me in his arms
The world is bright
All right

What's the difference if I say
I'll go away
When I know I'll come back
On my knees someday

For whatever my man is
I'm am his forever...
And ever...
Evermore...
