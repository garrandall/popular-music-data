I met her on the walk way
Stared as she walked pass
She looked back at me side ways and said
I can't help but to ask
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'

We end up going back to her place
Wish I could tell you what I saw
The sexiest women in a negligee
We hit off until the mornning
Until you hear her say

Mama se
Mama sa, mama coo sa
Mama se, mama sa
Mama coo sa

Billie Jean Is Always Talkin'
When Nobody Else Is Talkin'
Tellin' Lies And Rubbin' Shoulders
So They Called Her Mouth A Motor
Someone's Always Tryin' To Start My Baby Cryin'
Talkin', Squealin', lyin'
Sayin' You Just Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'

I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'

It's too high to get over,
Too low to get under.
You're stuck in the middle
And the pain is thunder.
It's too high to get over,
Too low to get under.
You're stuck in the middle
And the pain is thunder

You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
Someone's always tryin' to start my baby crying
Talkin', squealin', lyin you got my baby crying

I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'

It's too high to get over,
Too low to get under.
You're stuck in the middle
And the pain is thunder.
It's too high to get over,
Too low to get under.
You're stuck in the middle
And the pain is thunder

Mama se
Mama sa, mama coo sa
Mama se, mama sa
Mama coo sa
What did I make her say

Is getting a lil crazy (is getting lil crazy)
Always messing with my baby (messing with my baby)
And that's the reason she cries is
When I am not by her side
At the lonliest night (without my baby)
But I love how you
Always pompin when I'm thinkin' about you
I wanna bring back the night and share that look on your face
When you say

Mama se
Mama sa, mama coo sa
Mama se, mama sa
Mama coo sa
I want to make her say

It's too high to get over,
Too low to get under.
You're stuck in the middle
And the pain is thunder.
It's too high to get over,
Too low to get under.
You're stuck in the middle
And the pain is thunder
