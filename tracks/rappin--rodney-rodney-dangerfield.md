I tell ya I'm alright now
But last week I was in rough shape
But I don't get a break with nothin'

I played hide and seek when I was three
(No respect, no respect)
Why they couldn't even look for me
(No respect, no respect)
I was an ugly kid I never had fun
(No respect, no respect)
They took me to a dog show and I won!
(No respect, no respect)
When I was born I brought no joy
(No respect, no respect)
My old man said he wanted a boy
(No respect, no respect)
I was an ugly kid, always alone
(No respect, no respect)
Halloween I had to trick or treat over the phone
(No respect, no respect)
Friends don't call
My phone don't ring
I don't get a break with anything!
(What's the matter, Rodney?)
Ah, death, where is thy sting?!


It's just Rappin' Rodney
Ain't wrapped too tight
No, no Rappin' Rodney
Get out of sight
It's just Rappin' Rodney
Make no mistake
Poor old Rappin' Rodney
Can't get a break!

I'm getting old, it's hard to face
(No respect, no respect)
When during sex I lose my place
(No respect, no respect)
Steak and sex, my favorite pair
(No respect, no respect)
I have 'em both the same way, very rare
(No respect, no respect)
I know I'm old I could go any minute
(No respect, no respect)
I got a kidney-shaped pool with a stone in it
(No respect, no respect)
Doctor Vinnie Boombatz that's another one
(No respect, no respect)
I said I wanted to stop aging he gave me a gun
(No respect, no respect)
I told him I got water on the knee
He gave me a sponge and raised his fee
(What's the matter, Rodney?)
Ahhhh, it ain't easy bein' me


It's just Rappin' Rodney
Ain't wrapped too tight
No, no Rappin' Rodney
Get out of sight
It's just Rappin' Rodney
Make no mistake
Poor old Rappin' Rodney
Can't get a break!

Nothing goes right, I just can't fight it
(No respect, no respect)
Well Eastern Airlines thanked me for flying United
(No respect, no respect)
I got some money, what did I do?
(No respect, no respect)
I bought some quicksand, the deal fell through
(No respect, no respect)
My car broke down I called Triple A
(No respect, no respect)
They left the car and towed me away
(No respect, no respect)
I can't take it no more, I'm getting too old
(No respect, no respect)
I called suicide prevention, they put me on hold
(No respect, no respect)
Winter, summer, spring, and fall
I'm always up against the wall
(What's the matter, Rodney?)
Ahhh, I don't get no respect at all


It's just Rappin' Rodney
Ain't wrapped too tight
No, no Rappin' Rodney
Get out of sight
It's just Rappin' Rodney
Make no mistake
Poor old Rappin' Rodney
Can't get a break!

It's getting worse
It's caving in
The heaviness, I can't take it no more
It's all over
Hey, where are my kids?
Somebody help me
Hey bartender!
Hey! Who's that guy with my daughter?
Where's my wallet?
How do I get out of here?
Stop that dancing!
