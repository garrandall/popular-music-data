I remember times my love when we really had it all
You were always there to make me smile, help me when I fall
Oh, I can't believe you're leaving me
When there's so much more to say -- I can't let you go
Oh , every time I look at you I still can feel the glow
Let it be, let it grow

Love me , please , just a little bit longer
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Love me , please , just a little bit harder

All I ever wanted was to have you to myself
Then I see you standing there in the arms of someone else
You know a man can stand so much
And it's more then I can bear -- I can't let you go
Oh, every time I look at you I still can feel the glow
Let it be , let it grow

Love me , please, just a little bit longer
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Love me , please, just a little bit harder

Never even try to see things her way
It's hard on a woman when love ain't no love at all
And when she walks away (no no) -- and she probably will
You're gonna be sorry, begging her , please

Love me , please, just a little bit longer
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Love me , please, just a little bit harder

I think I can work it out
I can't get enough
I want you tomorrow

Love me , please, just a little bit longer
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Love me , please, just a little bit longer
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it

(repeat and fade)
