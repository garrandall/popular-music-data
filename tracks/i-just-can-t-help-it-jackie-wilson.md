Oh, I can't help it, I can't help it
Loving you baby is what I need
I can't help it, I just can't help it
Loving you baby is all I need
I want to be laughing
I don't want to be crying
If you move on down the line
I want to be laughing
I don't want to be crying
If you leave me behind
Hey!
All right, all right, oh baby!
I don't twist to the east
And I don't twist to the west
Gonna twist with the little girl
That I love best
I feel so good, I can jump, jump and shout
And let the whole doggone world
Know what it's all about
I miss you so much baby
That I don't know what to do
And you just take one step
Honey, I'll take two
I can't help it, no, no
I can't help it, oh baby!
Y'know, it's all right
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
When you move down the line
Hey!
All right, all right, oh baby!
You've got me flipping my lid
And I don't want to sleep
Tell me how can one little chick
Be so doggone sweet
I'm tossin' and turing' and I'm talkin' all out of my head
I'm sleeping on the floor when I should have stayed in bed
I'd walk a country mile for just one little kiss
Just a hopin' and a prayin' it will always be like this
I can't help it, no, no
I can't help it, no, no
I can't help it, all right
C'mon, all right, c'mon
C'mon baby
C'mon baby, c'mon baby, c'mon baby
Ah, you know it's all right...
