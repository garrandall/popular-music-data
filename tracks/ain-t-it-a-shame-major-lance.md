I have to love
To keep from crying
Ain't that a shame
Ain't that a shame
I was down
And almost died
Ain't that a shame
Ain't that a shame
Nobody knows
The trouble I've seen
The way you use my love
Is bout to run from me
And that's a shame
The way you do
Ain't that a shame
Now folks all think that
We're just swell, it's alright
It's alright
You're so good and
I'm so well, it's alright
It's alright
People, you talk
And it's such a lie
Funny how the people
Can be so blind
And I have to love
To keep from crying
Ain't that a shame
Nobody knows
The trouble I've seen
The way you use my love
Is bout to run from me
And that's a shame
The way you do
Ain't that a shame
Say ain't that a shame
Now ain't that a shame
Ain't that a shame
