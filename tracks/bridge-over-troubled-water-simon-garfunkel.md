When you're weary
Feeling small
When tears are in your eyes
I will dry them all
I'm on your side
When times get rough
And friends just can't be found


Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down


When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'll take your part
When darkness comes
And pain is all around


Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down


Sail on Silver Girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine, oh
If you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind


Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
