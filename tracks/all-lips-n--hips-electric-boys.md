Let me tell you a story about a sweet hootchie-coo
Who's a dancin' on the table right in front of you
She works all day in her old man's store
But she don't get enough, she wanna earn some more

Daddy's little angel's tongue in cheek
So by the end of the week, she close the boutique
Change her name, that's part of the game
While her daddy sits and wonders who's the hell to
Blame

Do you wanna dance, do you wanna dance here
Do you wanna dance here, wanna take a chance tonight
Do you wanna dance, do you wanna dance here
Do you wanna dance here, wanna make romance tonight

Oh, oh she's in the spotlight!
She's all lips and hips
She knows how to use 'em to make you flip
Lips and hips

And she gets ya with a wink of a fingertip
Lips and hips
You can tell that she knows how to give a kiss
Lips and hips
When she's found the target, she never miss

Now did I ever tell ya about the tattoo on her breast
She's got a tattoo on her breast tattooed by the best
It keeps rockin' from the East to the West
And she don't try to hide it by the way she's dressed

When she comes walking straight up to the table
Like a boy in a cradle you begin to shake
It's not only the time that gets hard for you
When she whispers in your ear you'll...

Do you wanna dance, do you wanna dance here...

Do you wanna dance, do you wanna dance here...

Lips and hips
