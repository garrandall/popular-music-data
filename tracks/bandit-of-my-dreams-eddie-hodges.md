(Da da da da dat boom boom
Bandit of my dreams)
(Da da da da dat boom boom
Bandit of my dreams)

Every night when I go to sleep
I just wait for you
Don't need to count sheep
Without a horse, without a gun
You rob my heart and away you run
For you're the bandit, the bandit
The bandit of my dreams

(Da da da da dat boom boom
Bandit of my dreams)

How I wish I could hold you near
But you steal a kiss then you disappear
I open my arms and close my eyes
You catch my poor lips by surprise
For you're the bandit, the bandit
The bandit of my dreams

(Da da da da dat boom boom
Bandit of my dreams)

One of these nights
I'll capture you and your charms
And sentence you to life imprisonment in my arms

Why don't you just surrender tonight
And give up your love to me without a fight
Why sneak around for goodness sake
Now don't you know I'm yours to take
For you bandit, my bandit
Sweet bandit of my dreams

(Da da da da dat boom boom
Bandit of my dreams)
(Da da da da dat boom boom
Bandit of my dreams)

So why don't you just surrender tonight
And give up your love to me without a fight
Why sneak around for goodness sake
Now don't you know I'm yours to take
For you bandit, my bandit
Sweet bandit of my dreams

(Da da da da dat boom boom
Bandit of my dreams)
(Da da da da dat boom boom
Bandit of my dreams)

(Repeat to fade)
