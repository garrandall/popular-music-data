The way that you love me
The way that you love me
The way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me

The way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me
The way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me

It ain't the clothes that you wear
It ain't the things that you buy
It ain't your house on the hill
It ain't the plane that you fly

It ain't your black limousine
It ain't your ninety-foot yacht
It ain't the things that you'll get
It ain't the things that you got

It ain't the money or the diamond rings
Honey, I ain't impressed with your material things

It's the way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me, baby
The way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me, babe

It ain't your friends at the top
It ain't their fortune and fame
It ain't your heavy connections
It ain't the Hollywood game

Ain't famous people or the parties they throw
Honey, I ain't impressed with all the people you know

It's just the way that you love me
(In the heat of the night)
It's just the way that you love me, baby

It's just the way that you love me
(When you're lovin' me right)
It's just the way that you love me, baby

It's just the way that you love me
(And the things that you do)
It's just the way that you love me, baby

It's just the way that you love me
(Make me crazy for you)
It's just the way that you love me, baby

Break it down
That's right
Keep it right there
I like that
Get tough

It ain't the money or the diamond rings
Honey, I ain't impressed with those material things

It ain't the trips to Brazil
It ain't the weekends in Rome
It ain't the French Riviera
You know I'd rather stay home

Ain't the Bahamas, it ain't Monaco
Honey, I ain't impressed with all the places we go

It's just the way that you love me
The way that you love me, baby
The way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me, baby

The way that you love me
(It ain't the money)
It's just the way that you love me
(Or the diamond rings)

The way that you love me
(Ain't what you buy my, baby)
It's just the way that you love me
(Ain't material things)

The way that you love me
(Ain't your Maserati)
It's just the way that you love me
(Your house on the hill)

The way that you love me
(It ain't the parties)
It's just the way that you love me
Or your trips to Brazil

Watch me dancing
Watch me dancing
Watch me dancing
I'm watching your, girl, girl
Watch me dancing
Keep a-rocking the world

Watch me dancing
you dance
Go Paula
Watch me dancing

Watch me dancing
I'm watching your, girl
Watch me dancing
