Lonely one of young so brokenhearted
Traveling down the rigid road of life
Using pharmaceutical extractions
To find the paradise
Finds the high but comes down feeling lower
Gets down on their knees and starts to pray
Looking up to heaven for the answer
They hear a voice that says


You will know
Troubled heart you'll know
Problems have solutions
Trust and I will show
Oh, you will know
Troubled heart you'll know
Every life has reason
For I made it so


Single parent trying to raise their children
But they would much rather not alone
Reaches out to find that special someone
To make their house a home
Finds someone but no one is the right one
Gets down on their knees and starts to pray
Looking up to heaven for the answer
They hear a voice that says


You will know
Troubled heart you'll know
Problems have solutions
Trust and I will show
Hey, you will know
Lonely heart you'll know
Every life has reason
For I made it so
You'll know
Troubled heart you'll know
Problems have solutions
Trust and I will show
You will know
Troubled heart you'll know
Every life has reason
For I made it so
And oh, you will know
Lonely heart you'll know
Problems have solutions
Trust and I will show, yeah
You will know (You will know)
Lonely heart you'll know
(You will know, you will know, you will know)
Every life has reason
For I made it so
You'll know
Lonely heart you'll know
