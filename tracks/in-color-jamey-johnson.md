I said Grandpa what's this picture here
It's all black and white, and it ain't real clear
Is that you there, he said yeah, I was eleven
And times were tough, back in thirty-five
That's me and Uncle Joe just tryin' to survive
A cotton farm, in the Great Depression


And if it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
You should've seen it in color


This one here was taken overseas
In the middle of hell, in nineteen forty-three
In the winter time, you can almost see my breath
That was my tail gunner ole' Johnny McGee
He was a high school teacher from New Orleans
And he had my back, right through the day we left


And if it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
You should've seen it in color
A picture's worth a thousand words
But you can't see what those shades of gray keep covered
You should've seen it in color


And this one is my favorite one
This is me and grandma in the, summer sun
All dressed up, the day we said our vows
You can't tell it here but it was hot that June
And that rose was red and her eyes were blue
And just look at that smile, I was so proud


That's the story of my life
Right there in black and white


And if it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
You should've seen it in color
Yeah, a picture's worth a thousand words
But you can't see what those shades of gray keep covered
You should've seen it in color


Should've seen it in color
