Does it feel the same
When he calls your name
And does it feel the same
When you play the game
Of love

When he holds you tight
Does it feel alright
Just like it used to do
When I was with you
Making love to you

This burning heart of mine
It still hurts after all this time
This burning heart in me
Won't let me be

After all this time
You still haunt my mind
I just can't seem to find
The peace of mind
I need so bad

Does it feel the same
When he calls your name
And does it feel the same
When you play the game
Of love

This burning heart of mine
It still hurts after all this time
This burning heart in me
Won't let me be, won't let me be

This burning heart of mine
It still hurts after all this time
This burning heart in me
Won't let me be

This burning heart of mine
It still hurts after all this time
This burning heart in me
Won't let me be, won't let me be

This burning heart of mine
It still hurts after all this time
This burning heart in me
Won't let me be

Oooh, won't you let me be
