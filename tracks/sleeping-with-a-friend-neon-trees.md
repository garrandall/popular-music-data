All my friends, they’re different people
Anxious like the ocean in a storm
When we go out, yeah, we’re electric
Coursing through our bodies ’til we’re one

And why mess up a good thing, baby?
It’s a risk to even fall in love
So, when you give that look to me
I better look back carefully
‘Cause this is trouble, yeah this is trouble


I said oh, oh
You got me in the mood, mood
I’m scared, but if my heart’s gonna break
Before the night will end
I said, oh, oh we’re in danger
Sleeping with a friend, sleeping with a friend
Sleeping with a friend


All my friends, stay up past midnight
Looking for the thing to fill the void
I don’t go out much like I used to
Something ’bout the strangers and the noise

And why leave when I got you, baby?
It’s a risk but babe, I need the thrill
I never said you’d be easy
But if it was all up to me
I’d be no trouble, hey, we’re in trouble


I said oh, oh
You got me in the mood, mood
I’m scared, but if my heart’s gonna break
Before the night will end
I said, oh, oh we’re in danger
Sleeping with a friend
Oh, oh we’re in danger
Sleeping with a friend

All my friends
All my friends
All my friends
All my friends
All my friends
All my friends
All my friends
All my friends


We are both young, hot-blooded people
We don’t wanna die alone
Two become one, it could be lethal
Sleeping with a friend
