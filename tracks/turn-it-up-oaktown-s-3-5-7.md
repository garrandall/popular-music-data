If you think you can move, then turn it up
And if you think you can groove, then turn it up
If you can pump up the noise, then turn it up
Fly girls and fly boys then turn it up, burn it up, turn it up

Too under to overdo it
Too strong to not to pursue it
I'm down and I'll go though it
You know, I thought you knew it

It's on and it won't be over
The beat's here to control you
Getting' bold but I am bolder
You want it, Oh yeah, I know you

If you think you can move, then turn it up
And if you think you can groove, then turn it up
If you can pump up the noise, then turn it up
Fly girls and fly boys just turn it up, burn it up, turn it up

Play it loud since you'll be gone
Hold tight, I won't be thrown
And when I'm done, you're on your own
It's out, your cover's blown
You fell in lust at first glance, Wanna know if I could dance
I will step all over your prance
Bust it up, You have no chance

If you think you can move, then turn it up
And if you think you can groove, then turn it up
If you can pump up the noise, then turn it up
Fly girls and fly boys just turn it up, burn it up, turn it up

T-t-t-turn it up
T-t-t-turn it up

It's deep but it gets deeper, comin' on just like a creeper
With each word your game gets weaker
Cheap suit and Converse sneakers
Comin' hard I'm gonna get cha
Better have your backup with ya
So broke no one can fix ya
To the asylum we will commit ya

If you think you can move, then turn it up
And if you think you can groove, then turn it up
If you can pump up the noise, then turn it up
Fly girls and fly boys just turn it up, burn it up, turn it up

Fly girls and fly boys t-t-t-turn it up
Fly girls and fly boys t-t-t-turn it up
Fly girls and fly boys t-t-t-turn it up
Fly girls and fly boys t-t-t-turn it up

Turn it up
T-t-t-turn it up
T-t-t-turn it up
T-t-t-turn it up
T-t-t-turn it up
T-t-t-turn it up
T-t-t-turn it up
T-t-t-turn it up

Step aside we're on our way,
Have no time for the games you play
Leavin' you with nothing left to say
I bagged you up and sent you on your way
A new sucker has been born
A style so old you look worn
I told you once so you've been warned
Like a child you will be scorned

If you think you can move, then turn it up
And if you think you can groove, then turn it up
If you can pump up the noise, then turn it up
Fly girls and fly boys just turn it up, burn it up, turn it up

T-t-t-turn it up
T-t-t-turn it up
T-t-t-turn it up
T-t-t-turn it up, burn it up, turn it up

Fly girls and fly boys
Fly girls and fly boys
Fly girls and fly boys
Fly girls and fly boys

If you think you can move, then turn it up
And if you think you can groove, then turn it up
If you can pump up the noise, then turn it up
Fly girls and fly boys just turn it up, burn it up, turn it up

If you think you can move
