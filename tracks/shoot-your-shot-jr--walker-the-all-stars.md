I say, "yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah"
Yeah-yeah, shoot your shot
What I mean
I said, "Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah"
Yeah, yeah
Shake what you've got
Hey, girl!

Now, you come to this home
Don't stand on your block
Come inside
Watch ev'rybody rock

Ev'rybody's feelin' like they
Lost their minds
Doin' a dance
They call, The Twine

So I say, "Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah"
Yeah-yeah, shoot your shot
(Really gonna get it too, yeah)
I say, "Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah"
Yeah, yeah
Shake what you've got

'Let's hear it, Marvin'
Shake, shake
('Let the sax in, too')

(That's what we're doin)
(That's what we're doin', now)
(That's what we're doin')
(That's what we're doin', now)
(That's what we're doin')
(That's what we're doin', now)

(That's what we're doin')
(That's what we're doin', now)

(That's what we're doin')
(That's what we're doin', now)
(That's what we're doin')
(That's what we're doin', now)

I say, "Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah"
Yeah-yeah, shoot your shot
'Call when I need you'
I say, "Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah"
Yeah, yeah
Shake what you've got
Hey, girl!

Looked at them start
To block this house
Somebody hollered
"Hey, boy heard you rock!"

Police is standin'
At the door
People, see 'em dancin'
All ov'r the floor

They hollered, "Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah"
Yeah-yeah, shoot your shot
Woo!
(Get away from here)
I said, "Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah"
Yeah, yeah
Shake what you got

You know what I mean, now
(Go ahead 'n work!)

Do the Hully Gully
The Wild Cat, too
Wait a minute baby, now
You ain't through

(Hey!)
