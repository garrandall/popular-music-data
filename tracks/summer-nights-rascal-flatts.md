Ha ha ha ha ha
Itâs summer nights, babe!
Woo! Yeah, yeah, yeah

Come on ladies, itâs time to pop that top
And fellas, I know youâre ready to rock
We went crazy cooped all winter long
And school is out, so letâs get it on
Flip flop tans and some white sand, I know the perfect spot

Well, the sunset better set soon
So we can get in the mood
Things start getting all heated up
When it starts getting cool, yeah


Summer nights, everybody, are you with me?
Let that Igloo cooler mark your piece of paradise
Summer nights, everybodyâs feeling sexy
Holler if youâre ready for some summer nights
A-come on, oh yeah, yeah

Now fellas, you better watch your step
Donât let them teeny French bikinis make you lose your breath
Back to the ladies, yâall keep doing yâallâs thang
âCause everything about you makes me wanna scream

The sun is getting low, there it goes
Here we go, here comes the moon, yeah
Things start getting all heated up
When it starts getting cool, yeah


Summer nights, everybody, are you with me?
Let that Igloo cooler mark your piece of paradise
Summer nights, everybodyâs feeling sexy
Holler if youâre ready for some summer nights

Itâs a party down in Padre
Big bonfire on the beach
Itâs Coronas in Daytona yâall
Where itâs wild and itâs free


Summer nights, everybody, are you with me?
Let that Igloo cooler mark your piece of paradise
Summer nights, everybodyâs feeling sexy
Holler if youâre ready for some summer nights
A-come on


Summer nights, everybody, are you with me?
Let that Igloo cooler mark your piece of paradise
Summer nights, everybodyâs feeling sexy
Holler if youâre ready for some summer nights

Yeah, oh, are you ready?
Are you ready? Are you ready?
For some summer nights
Yeah baby

Summer nights!
Itâs summer nights
Come on!
