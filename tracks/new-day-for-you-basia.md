Hello again it's me

Your shoulder's where I sit
The half, nobody sees,of a silent partnership
I am here your help at hand

I'm never far away
A clear view from where I stand
I'll be there if you need me

I am your helping hand
My words you've heard them all before
It's only for the sake of love

It's gonna be a new day for you
A new day for you
The stars have played their part
The past is gone and done
Have more faith in love
The best is yet to come

So what is this I hear?

You deserve a break

Take time to think it out
Don't make a new mistake
I am here your help at hand

It's gonna be a new day for you
A new day for you, new day for you, new day for you
The stars have played their part
The past is gone and done
Have more faith in love
The best is yet to come

My words you've heard them all before
It's only for the sake of love

The stars have played their part
The past is gone and done
Have more faith in love
The best is yet to come

It's gonna be a new day for you
A new day for you, new day for you, new day for you
It's gonna be a new day for you
A new day for you, new day for you, new day for you

Hello again it's me
