Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah


You're not alone
Together we stand
I'll be by your side
You know, I'll take your hand


And when it gets cold
And it feels like the end
There's no place to go
You know, I won't give in


(Ah-ah)


No, I won't give in


(Ah-ah)


(Keep holding on)


'Cause you know we'll make it through, we'll make it through


(Just stay strong)


'Cause, you know, I'm here for you


I'm here for you


There's nothing you can say (Nothing you can say)
Nothing you can do (Nothing you can do)
There's no other way when it comes to the truth
So (Keep holding on)
'Cause, you know, we'll make it through, we'll make it through


So far away
I wish you were here
Before it's too late
This could all disappear


Before the doors close,
And it comes to an end,
With you by my side,
I will fight and defend (Ah-ah)
I'll fight and defend (Ah-ah)
Yeah! Yeah!


(Keep holding on)


'Cause you know we'll make it through, we'll make it through


(Just stay strong)


'Cause, you know, I'm here for you


There's nothing you can say (Nothing you can say)
Nothing you can do (Nothing you can do)
There's no other way when it comes to the truth
So (Keep holding on)
'Cause, you know, we'll make it through, we'll make it through


Hear me when I say, when I say I believe
Nothing's gonna change, nothing's gonna change destiny
Whatever's meant to be will work out perfectly
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


La da da da
La da da da
La da da da da da da da da

 (FINN & RACHEL WITH NEW DIRECTIONS)
(Keep holding on)
'Cause, you know, we'll make it through
(WITH FINN: we'll make it through)
(Just stay strong)
'Cause, you know, I'm here for you, (WITH FINN: I'm here for you)
