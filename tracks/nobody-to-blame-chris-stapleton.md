She took down the photograph
Of our wedding day
Ripped it down the middle
And threw my half away
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
She broke all my fishing rods
Put my guns in hock
Threw my clothes out in the yard
And changed out all the locks
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me


I know right where I went wrong
I know just what got her gone
Turned my life into this country song
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

She fired up my old hot rod
Ran it in the pond
Put sugar in my John Deere
I canât even mow my lawn
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
She built her a bonfire
With my old six string
Took all my good whiskey
And poured it down the drain
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
