Sitting in the mornin' sun
I'll be sitting when the evening comes
Watching the ships roll in
Then I watch 'em roll away again, yeah


Sitting on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide, roll away, ooh wee
I'm sitting on the dock of the bay
Wasting time


I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the Frisco Bay
'Cause I had nothin' to live for
And look like nothin's gonna come my way, so


I'm just come sitting on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away, ooh wee
I'm sitting on the dock of the bay, wasting time


Looks like nothin's gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same


Sitting here resting these bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It’ two thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this dock my home


Now I'm just sitting on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away, ooh wee
I’m sitting on the dock of the bay
I'm wasting time
