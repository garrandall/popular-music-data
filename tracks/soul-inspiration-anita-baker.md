If I lost you now
It would take my heart from me
I can't imagine life without
The love of you, baby

Lately I confess
I've been short on tenderness
Too much time on work, I guess
Not enough for you

Now if I forgot to tell you I love you
I really got no excuse, no excuse


Because you're beautiful
My one desire
You're my soul's inspiration
And if I didn't say it
Then I do now
You're my sweet inspiration

Baby baby

If I'm feeling low
I've only got myself to blame
Cause I can always share the load
When I'm near you, uh huh
You can rescue me
You bring out the best in me
I'm the girl I wanna be
When I'm near you

I may need reminding to say I love you
But heaven knows that I do, yes I do


Because you're beautiful
My one desire
You're my sweet sensation
And if I didn't say it
Then I do now
You're my soul's inspiration
Because you're beautiful
My one desire
You're my sweet sensation
And if I didn't say it
Then I do now
You're my soul's inspiration

From the day I met you baby
Yes I knew instinctively
Whatever our future
Together we were gonna be baby
