Bows and flows of angel hair
An ice cream castle's in the air
Feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain their snow on everyone
So many things I would've done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's clouds' illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

The moon and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
When every fairytale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care don't let 'em know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, still, somehow it's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears, fears feeling doubt
To say I love right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

But now friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
But something's lost, but something's gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all
