Have a baby 
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire 
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire 
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire 
Be a millionaire, be a, be a millionaire 
Have a baby 
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire 
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire 
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire 
Be a millionaire, be a, be a millionaire 

 
I don't play no games (I don't play no games)
So when I'm in that thang (when I'm in that thang)
Come see what I mean (see what I mean)
See what I mean, owww (see what I mean)
Said lil' mama put me on (baby put me on)
Bet I'll have you gone (bet I'll have you gone)
Come see what I mean (see what I mean)
See what I mean (see what I mean)
Come see what I mean, come come come

 
First is her neck, yeah, then her back
Me I'm a freak, I get into all that
Girl, I'll perform for ya like a porno star
'Til you've had enough then I just need a little bit more
New music, new mood, new position
New erotic sounds, it's going down, now listen
I can hear your heartbeat, you're sweatin'
I could paint a perfect picture
I get deeper and deeper, I told ya I'd get ya
I'd work that, murk that, just the way you like it, baby
Turn a quickie into an all-nighter maybe
Your sex drive it match my sex drive
Then we be moving as fast as a Nascar rides
Switch gears, slow down, go down, whoa now
You could feel every inch of it when we intimate
I use my tongue, baby, a little sprung maybe
I had your head spinning saying "50 so crazy"


I don't play no games (I don't play no games)
So when I'm in that thang (when I'm in that thang)
Come see what I mean (see what I mean)
See what I mean, owww (see what I mean)
Said lil' mama put me on (baby put me on)
Bet I'll have you gone (bet I'll have you gone)
Come see what I mean (see what I mean)
See what I mean (see what I mean)
Come see what I mean, come see what I mean


Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire (Ohhhh)
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire (Come see what I mean)
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire (Owww)
Be a millionaire, be a, be a millionaire (Lil mama come see what I mean)
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire (Ohhhh)
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire (Come see what I mean)
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire (owww)
Be a millionaire, be a, be a millionaire 


Girl, I want you to give me what you got then give me more
Baby, you could start on top or all-fours
You know I like it when you get in to it
Don't nobody do it, uh, like I do it
Feel a rush from my touch
Get intoxicated, drunk off my love, call it Hennessy thug
Passion, you laughin', I make you smile on the regular
Tell me what you want, shawty, and that's what I'mma get to ya
Yo, I need you to be what I need more than liquor and weed
I need you to maybe give me a seed
I need you to give me a reason to breath
I need you, I'm telling you this so you know what I need
I'll be your part time or full time lover, significant other
Don't matter which way it go, I'm oh so gutter
Girl, you could get it however you wanna get it
I'm feeling you, still I'm feeling you right now, I'mma get it


I don't play no games (I don't play no games)
So when I'm in that thang (when I'm in that thang)
Come see what I mean (see what I mean)
See what I mean, owww (see what I mean)
Said lil' mama put me on (baby put me on)
Bet I'll have you gone (bet I'll have you gone)
Come see what I mean (see what I mean)
See what I mean (see what I mean)
Come see what I mean, come see what I mean


Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire 
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire 
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire 
Be a millionaire, be a, be a millionaire 
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire 
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire 
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire 
Be a millionaire, be a, be a millionaire 
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire 
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire 
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire 
Be a millionaire, be a, be a millionaire
