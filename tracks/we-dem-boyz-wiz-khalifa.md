Yeah ayy!
Yeah ayy!
Yeah Boyz
Yeah
Hol' up, hol' up


Hol' up, we dem boyz
Hol' up, we dem boyz
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we makin' noise, hol' up
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up hol' up
Hol' up, we dem boyz
Hol' up, we dem boyz
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we makin' noise, hol' up
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up hol' up


Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, pop a bottle
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, if you suck then swallow
Smell that marijuana, they gon' follow
Throwin money on her like she won the lotto
Pussy must be serious
Hol' up, Scared of heights come face your fears
Hol' up, hol' up
Do it just like Nicki gon' and bend it over
Say she never smoked I turned her to a stoner
Young nigga but I'm ready
Oh, foreign girls call me sexy
And white girls gimme becky
But first I gotta roll this joint, baby hol' up


Hol' up, we dem boyz
Hol' up, we dem boyz
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we makin' noise, hol' up
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up hol' up
Hol' up, we dem boyz
Hol' up, we dem boyz
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we makin' noise, hol' up
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up hol' up


Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, you drive me crazy
Number 1, bitch you can't replace me
Leave the club these hoes be tryin' to chase me
You got a ass so fat let's make a baby (and another one!)
Damn, I'm smokin' weed in my Mercedes
Hol' up, these niggas broke, these niggas lazy
Man they money slim, they actin shady
I'm in my brand new car, who wanna race
Ho, bitch you ain't call my phone so why you showin' up
I'm takin them shots all my niggas stay loaded up
Man on the low all these hoes be actin so material
Hol' up, man did you see her interior


Hol' up, we dem boyz
Hol' up, we dem boyz
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we makin' noise, hol' up
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up hol' up
Hol' up, we dem boyz
Hol' up, we dem boyz
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we makin' noise, hol' up
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up hol' up
