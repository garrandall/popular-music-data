Man, that because these bitches want me
Weed feel like I dipped it in honey (Itâs sticky)
Hand cuffin cause she model
Man,my hand cuffs is pair of diamonds
Hoping that she want to fucking swallow (Fuck me bitch)
I hit the club and click pictures,called the lotto
I got a deal they say Iâm comfortable
Well, yeah, Iâm treating verses like Lunchables
Drop top GT to feel the weather
Your broke ass GT, get it together




Hol up, Nah! ainât gon touch that style (Oh no)
About my business, you already know I donât fuck around
Unless Iâm touching down with your bitch
Got her going up and down on that dick
She said what we doing tonight
Cause I donât know what youâre doing but we better get to that shit quick
My new name Freshness ,Aloe Vicious 
All about my business
I donât do fake, I donât do hate, and I damn sure donât do no dishes
All my niggas trip, all my niggas thorough
Half em rep their block, half em rep their borough
Look All these niggas know me, that Inglewood homie
Got respect from all the OGs', what the fuck you bout to show me? Hol up




Itâs the conglomerate bitch! Make some noise
Respect and honour it bitch, We dem boyz
Rookie your bitch chose me, she made a choice
She said hol up hol up, I hear his voice
When I pull up, Rolls Royce
While we spend all this money, you counting coins
My bitch be bathing in berries it smell like oils
Hol up, Hol up, Hol up, Hol up,We Dem Boys
Now if you fucking with me, fire up in the air, light your dutches with me
Stack some more Mâs bout a hundred fifty
Hol up, Hol up, Hol up, and if you fucking with me
Sing it!
