Do it, while your soul's still burnin'
Don't hide the yearnin' away
Say what you want to say
'Cause if you let her go
You'll always know you blew it
Go to it and do it
Yeah
Do it, yeah

Tell her, just how much you love her
And that no other
Could do what she does to you
'Cause if you take your time
You're gonna find you blew it
Go thru it and do it
Yeah, do it
Yeah, do it



'Cause if you take your time
You're gonna find you blew it
Go thru it and do it
Yeah, do it
Do it, go and do it
