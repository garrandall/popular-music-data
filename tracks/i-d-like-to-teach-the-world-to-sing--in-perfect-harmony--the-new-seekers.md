I'd like to build the world a home
And furnish it with love
Grow apple trees and honey bees
And snow white turtle doves


I'd like to teach the world to sing
In perfect harmony
I'd like to hold it in my arms
And keep it company


I'd like to see the world for once
All standing hand in hand
And hear them echo through the hills
For peace through out the land
(That's the song I hear)


I'd like to teach the world to sing
In perfect harmony
I'd like to teach the world to sing
In perfect harmony


I'd like to build the world a home
And furnish it with love
Grow apple trees and honey bees
And snow white turtle doves


I'd like to teach the world to sing
In perfect harmony
I'd like to hold it in my arms
And keep it company


I'd like to see the world for once
All standing hand in hand
And hear them echo through the hills
For peace through out the land
(That's the song I hear)


I'd like to teach the world to sing
In perfect harmony
I'd like to teach the world to sing
In perfect harmony


I'd like to teach the world to sing
In perfect harmony, that's the song I hear
