Jessie went away last summer, couple of months ago
After all our time together it was hard to see her go
She called me right up when she arrived asked me one more time to come
Livin' on a LA freeway ain't my kind of havin' fun

I think I'd rather be a cowboy
I think I'd rather ride a range
I think I'd rather be a cowboy
Than to lay me down in love and lady's chains

We were just beginning, it was such an easy way
Layin' backup in the mountains makin' songs for sunny days
She got tired of pickin' daisies and cookin' my meals for me
She can live the life she wants to, yes, and it's all right with me

I think I'd rather be a cowboy
I think I'd rather ride a range
I think I'd rather be a cowboy
Than to lay me down in love and lady's chains

I'd rather live on the side of a mountain
Than wander through the canyons of concrete and steel
I'd rather laugh with the rain and sunshine
And lay down my sundown in some starry field

Oh, but I miss her in the mornin' when I awake alone
The absence of her laughter is a cold and empty sound
But her memory always makes me smile and I want you to know
I love her, yes I love her, just enough to let her go

I think I'd rather be a cowboy
I think I'd rather ride a range
I think I'd rather be a cowboy
Than to lay me down in love and lady's chains
I think I'd rather be a cowboy
I think I'd rather ride a range
I think I'd rather be a cowboy
Than to lay me down in love lady's chains
