Baby, let me be good to you
I'll do anything you want me to

Your love has brought me around
Every time I was feeling down
And I'm so glad you gave everything you had
Now it's my turn

Baby, let me be good to you

Now sit in your easy chair
What you want, I'll bring it there
Even good can be better
Here's my love on a silver platter take it all

Baby, let me be good to you

Here it is, take it all
Don't be shy you need no alibi
I wanna do it

Baby, let me be good to you

Here's my love, take it all
Don't be shy you need no alibi
I wanna do it

Baby, let me, oh, I wanna be good to you
Baby, let me I wanna be good to you
Baby, baby, let me be good to you
Oh, I wanna be so good

Oh, baby, baby please let me be good to you
Oh, I wanna be so good
Oh, baby, oh, baby I wanna be good to you
