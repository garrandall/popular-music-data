The sun goes down
The night rolls in
You can feel it starting
All over again

The moon comes up
And the music calls
You're getting tired of
Staring at the same four walls

You're out of your room
And down on the street
Moving through the crowd
In the midnight heat

The traffic roars
And the sirens scream
You look at the faces
It's just like a dream

Nobody knows where you're going
Nobody cares where you've been

'Cause you belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness
Beneath the neon light

You were born in the city
Concrete under your feet
It's in your moves
It's in your blood
You're a man of the street

When you said goodbye
You were on the run
Trying to get away
From the things you've done

Now you're back again
And you're feeling strange
So much has happened
But nothing has changed

You still don't know where you're going
You're still just a face in the crowd

You belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness
Beneath the neon light

You were born in the city
Concrete under your feet
It's in your blood
It's in your moves
You're a man of the street

You can feel it
You can taste it
You can see it
You can face it

You can hear it hey
You're getting near it hey
You wanna make it whoa
'Cause you can take it whoa

You belong to the city
You belong to the night
You belong to the city
You belong to the night

You belong
You belong
Oh...
