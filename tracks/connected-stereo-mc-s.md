Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah


Something ain't right
I'm gonna get myself
I'm gonna get myself
I'm gonna get myself connected
I ain't gonna go blind
For the light which is reflected
I see thru you, I see thru you
I see thru you, I see thru you
Ya dirty tricks
Ya make me sick
I see thru you
I see thru you
I'm gonna do it again
I'm gonna do it again
Oh!


I'm gonna do it again
Gotta do right
Cause something ain't right
Gotta do right
Come on
If you make sure you're connected
The writing's on the wall
But if your mind's neglected
Stumble you might fall
Stumble you might fall
Stumble you might fall
(Stereo MC's)


I!
Ain't gonna go blind
I see thru you, I see thru you
I see thru you, I see thru you
I'm gonna get myself
I'm gonna get myself
I'm gonna get myself connected
I ain't gonna go blind
For the light that is reflected
Hear me out
Can ya hear me out
Can ya hear me out
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
I
Wanna do it again
I wanna do it again
I wanna do it again
Ya terrified
I wanna do it again
Ain't gonna go blind
Ain't gonna go blind
I wanna do it again


Here we go
If you make sure you're connected
The writing's on the wall
But if your mind's neglected
Stumble you might fall
Stumble you might fall
Hear me out
Stumble you might fall


Interstate 5
Stayin' alive
Won't someone try
Open up your eyes
You must be blind
If you can't see
The gaping hole called reality
Wanna do it again
I gonna gonna do it again
I wanna do it again
Come on
I'm gonna do it again
Hear me out
Terrified
Something ain't right
Here we go


If you make sure you're connected
The writing's on the wall
But if your mind's neglected
Stumble you might fall
Stumble you might fall
Stumble you might fall
If you make sure you're connected
The writing's on the wall
But if your mind's neglected
Stumble you might fall
Stumble you might fall
Stumble you might fall
If you make sure you're connected
The writing's on the wall
But if your mind's neglected
Stumble you might fall
Stumble you might fall
Stumble you might fall
If you make sure you're connected
The writing's on the wall
But if your mind's neglected
Stumble you might fall
Stumble you might fall
