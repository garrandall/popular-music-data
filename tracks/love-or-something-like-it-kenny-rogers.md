Show me a bar with a good looking woman
Then just get out of my way
Turn on the jukebox, I'll show you a song you should play
Sooner or later a few shots of Bourbon
And I'll think of somethin' to say
Whoa, I can take her or leave her
I'd like to take her away

Liquor and music, a good combination
If you've got love on the brain
I never knew two women who acted the same
Some want a drink first, and some want to just sit and talk
Whoa, oh, it's two in the mornin'
I'm running' and she wants to walk

Something's got a hold on me
It's cheap but it ain't free
Love or somethin' like it's got a hold on me

That's when I asked her, my place or your place
I hope I'm not out of line
I asked the wrong thing, but just the right woman this time
She knew a hotel, she even had a name we could sign
Whoa, oh, the cheaper the grapes are, the sweeter the taste of the wine

Something's got a hold on me
It's cheap but it ain't free
Love or somethin' like it's got a hold on me

Something's got a hold on me
It's cheap but it ain't free
Love or somethin' like it's got a hold on me
Love or somethin' damn near like it's got a hold on me
