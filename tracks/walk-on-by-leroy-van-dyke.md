If I see you tomorrow
On some street in town
Pardon me if I don't say' hello'
I belong to another and it wouldn't look so good
To know someone I'm not supposed to know

Just walk on by
Wait on the corner
I love you but we're strangers when we meet
Just walk on by
Wait on the corner
I love you but we're strangers when we meet

In dimly little corner
In a place outside of town
Tonight we'll try to say goodbye again
But I know it's not over
I'll call tomorrow night
I can't let you go, so why pretend

Just walk on by
Wait on the corner
I love you but we're strangers when we meet
Just walk on by
Wait on the corner
I love you but we're strangers when we meet
I love you but we're strangers when we meet
