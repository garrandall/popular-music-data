Yea, yea, yea yeah
Yea, yea, yea yeah
Yea, yea, yea yeah
Ah...

You came, I was alone
I should have known
You were temptation

You sighed, leading me on
I should have known
You were temptation

It would be thrilling
If you were willing
But if it can never be
Well then pity me

You were, born to be kissed
I can't resist
You are temptation

I'm yours, here is my heart
Take it and say, "We'll never part"
I'm just a slave, only a slave

Yea, yea, yea, yeah
Yea, yea, yea, yeah
Yea, yea, yea, yeah
Ah...

Yea, yea, yea, yeah
Yea, yea, yea, yeah
Yea, yea, yea, yeah
Yea, yea, yea, yeah
Yea, yea, yea, yeah
