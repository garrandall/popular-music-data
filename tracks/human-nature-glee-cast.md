Looking out
Across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear his voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs


Get me out
Into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite


If they say,
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, ( does he do me that way)
If they say,
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way


Reaching out
To touch a stranger


Electric eyes are everywhere


See that girl
She knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare


If they say,
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, oh why, does he do me that way
If they say,
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, oh why, does he do me that way


I like livin' this way


I like lovin' this way


Oh why
Oh why


Looking out
Across the morning
Where the city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch his shoulder


I'm dreaming of the street

If they say,
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say,
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way


I like livin' this way


I like lovin' this way


Oh why
Oh why


Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why.
