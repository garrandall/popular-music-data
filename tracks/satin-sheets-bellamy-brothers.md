I wish I was a millionaire
I'd play rock music and grow long hair
I tell you boys I'd buy a new Rolls Royce.

Pretty women'd come to me I'd give 'em all the third degree
I'd give 'em Satin Sheets to keep 'em off the streets.

Hallelujah
let me sook it to ya
Praise the Lord and pass the tambourine
Great Jehova
you'll come over
As soon as you see me boogie-woogie
'Cross the silver screen.

I can hang 'em high or hang 'em low
I'd put 'em in the ceilings wherever I'd go
And swing all night from the rafter lights.

Hallelujah
let me sook it to ya
...
I wish you was a millionaire
...
Hallelujah
let me sook it to ya
