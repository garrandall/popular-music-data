I got sand all by my bath water
Candles by my wine glass
Women all on my time
Imagine how my time pass
They say them freaks come out at night
And you know who they came to see
Even though she ain't mine
I fucked her like her man to be


So many girls in here tonight
So many girls in here tonight
I'm just lookin' for the right one
Exotic as they might come
Better leave with two cause really I don't like one
So many girls in here tonight


Light skin, dark skin
Sit your fine ass right there
Come join at my table and don't question when tonight end
Toss a couple dollars and she down for whatever
Make no promises but promise I could fuck you better
Fuck that singing shit, I be the shit
That YM, too legit to quit
You thinkin' that you better then that Venus and Serena shit
I'm all up up on my ladies chick
She saying it's the greatest dick
I one-two stroke her
We caught up in the moment, aye
T-t-turn up, V12 and I burn up
My chick that fly bitch
And your bitch unheard of
4AM and we still poppin' bottles
Probably have a new chick tomorrow
Cause there's so many




My problems in this pitcher
Got a bucket full of liquor
And I know ya'll got that bad bitch
I got way too many niggas
What's your phone number
Tyga gots a roller
Loud pack with your bad ass
Cause these good girls just ain't no fun
Double cup and I'm slowed up
Smokin' dub with my chauffeur
Sneaka fly, hitta stylin'
I'm the reason why you niggas foamed up
New York and my slow bucks
DC got that old cup
Hold up, these niggas want no bucks
Straight shot sipper
I ain't mixing my liquor
Bitch I'm not kidding
Ya'll some fisher price niggas
And we some life livers
Hoping that this life give us
A lot of money, success, and a woman to ride with us
