I, fell asleep late last night...
And I dreamed the night and almost half the day away
I just got up
So that I could hear her say
She's still in love
And no one can take her love away


Ooh love, wakes me up every day
And I thought no one
Could ever make me feel this way
It fills me up
Every time I hear her say
She's still in love
And no one could take her love away


I wanna be loved
There's nothing better than love
What in the world could you ever be thinking of?
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love
To love



And I mean all these words I say
You don't have to guess
What's going on inside my head


Just try to know
All the things that our hearts say
Listen to love
And always get love to lead the way


Whenever you love
There's nothing better than love
What in the world could you ever be thinking of?
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love


(For love, for love)
You know for love I would go anywhere
(For love) I would go there
(For love, for love)
For love to the ends of nowhere
It's for her love
And for her love
I would go
I would go
I would go
I would go...



And I would love (would love)
To just spend all my time
With a girl
Who makes me feel her love is mine


Someone you see
Who would only dream of me
She'd be in love
Just 'cause she'd want to be


She'd want to be loved
There's nothing better than love
What in the world could you ever be thinking of?
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love

Oh, oh...
There's nothing better than love
What in the world could you ever be thinking of?
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love

Oh, oh...
There's nothing better than love
What in the world could you ever be thinking of?
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love
