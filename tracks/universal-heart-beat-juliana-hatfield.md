Beauty can be sad; you're proof of that
When the damage is done, you're damaged goods
That's not to say it's not okay
I wouldn't have it any other way

A heart, a heart that hurts, is a heart, a heart that works
A heart, a heart that hurts, is a heart, a heart that works

Sweet, sweet pain comes with the sun
Lie down and soak it up, burn off layers of insulators
Exposed nose to the cold, I'm bleeding pretty colors
Yeah, all over myself

A heart, a heart that hurts, is a heart, a heart that works
A heart, a heart that hurts, is a heart, a heart that works

Black wave comes to take me away
I ride it almost to the grave
Landing on a crowded shore, high-fiving
What a trip; I'm better for it
I feel a live sensation

A heart, a heart that hurts, is a heart, a heart that works
A heart, a heart that hurts, is a heart, a heart that works
A heart, a heart that hurts, is a heart, a heart that works
A heart, a heart that hurts, is a heart, a heart that works
A heart, a heart that hurts, is a heart, a heart that works
A heart, a heart that hurts, is a heart, a heart that works
