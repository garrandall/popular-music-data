Baby, I'm-a want you
Baby, I'm-a need you
You the only one
I care enough to hurt about

Maybe I'm-a crazy
But I just can't live without
Your loving and affection
Giving me direction
Like a guiding light to help me
Through my darkest hour

Lately I'm-a praying
That you'll always be a-staying beside me

Used to be
My life was just emotions passing by
Feeling all the while
And never really knowing why

Lately I'm-a praying
That you'll always be
A-staying beside me

Used to be my life
Was just emotions passing by
Then you came along
And made me laugh
And made me cry
You taught me why

Baby, I'm-a want you
Baby, I'm-a need you

Oh, it took so long to find you, baby

Baby, I'm-a want you
Baby, I'm-a need you
