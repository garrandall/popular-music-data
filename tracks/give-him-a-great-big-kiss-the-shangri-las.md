Here comes my guy, walking down the street
Look how he walks with a dancing beat
Thick wavy hair, a little too long
All day long he's singing his song

And when I see him in the street
My heart takes a leap and skips a beat
Gonna walk right up to him
Give him a great big kiss

Tell him that I love him
Tell him that I care
Tell him that I'll always be there

Well, what color are his eyes?
I don't know he's always wearing shades
Is he tall?
Well, I've got to look up
Yeah? Well, I hear he's bad
Hmm, he's good, bad but he's not evil

Tell me more, tell me more
Big bulky sweaters to match his eyes
Dirty fingernails, oh, boy, what a prize
Tight tapered pants, high button shoes
He's always looking like, like he's got the blues

And when I see him in the street
My heart takes a leap and skips a beat
I gonna walk right up to him
Give him a great big kiss

Tell him that I love him
Tell him that I care
Tell him that I'll always be there

Is he a good dancer?
What do you mean is he a good dancer?
Well, how does he dance?
Close, very, very close

And when I see him in the street
My heart takes a leap and skips a beat
I gonna walk right up to him
Give him a great big kiss

Tell him that I love him
Tell him that I care
Tell him that I'll always be there
