Weekend love
Caught up in a weekend love
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love


If you've been misled
By anything I said
I didn't mean to turn you on
The vibe was oh so strong
And you got things to do
And I have got things too
So I'll catch you on the weekend
Mondays through Friday's out - I'll see you then


A W-E-E-K and a E-N-D
And a L-O-V-E we were meant to be
A W-E-E-K, a E-N-D
L-O-V-E we were meant to be


Weekend love
Caught up in a weekend love
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love


Seems it's been so long
Since you filled me with your charms
I tenderly imagine me
Resting in your arms
But you've got things to do
And I have got things too
So I'll catch you on the weekend
Monday through Friday's out - I'll see you then


Because we're sorry when we part
And we love when we meet
I know we only do that
Once in a week
Sorry when we part
And we love when we meet
I know we only do that
Once in a week

I know, you know
We are occupied
From our own love life
This has been denied
Many feelins high
Many tears of pride
But by the weekend
That must be rectified


Weekend love
Gonna spend a weekend love (maybe someday it will change)
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love


If you've been misled
By anything I said
I didn't mean to turn you on
The vibe was oh so strong
And you got things to do
And I have got things too
So I'll catch you on the weekend
Monday through Friday's out - I'll see you then


A W-E-E-K and a E-N-D
L-O-V-E we were meant to be
A W-E-E-K, a E-N-D
L-O-V-E we were meant to be


To nourish and cherish every moment
To deliver the goods I am efficient
And I know you're possessed with the ingredients
During the week the days seems to be long
But by the weekend I wish I could reverse its time
Great things can come in a small bag
So let's make use of the time that we have
When we are together cos we stay popular

When we are together, I sit and I wonder
If this love is gonna last forever
Well then I think and I start remember
That we are just a...


Weekend love
Gonna spend a weekend love
Weekend love
Just a case of weekend love
