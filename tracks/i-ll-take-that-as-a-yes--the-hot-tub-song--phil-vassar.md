You like a dozen wine red roses
Candlelight on porcelain set tables and that's fine
Well, I'll go out of my way for you anytime
That's right baby
The fire's warm
So you take off your sweater
Now it's my turn and I'll do you one better
That's the game, we both will like to play
You wink, I laugh
'Cause we know a little hug leads to a foot rub
Then a hot tub
Then a French kiss on a bear rug
Do you like it? Do you like it?
How about this? Wanna try it?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll take that as a yes
You like snuggling with your pillow
With my arms tight holding us together
Breathing deep
And drifting like a feather in a stream
And then I touch you on the shoulder
Feel your skin soft
Underneath my fingers
And I know, we'll never get to sleep
You wink, I laugh
'Cause we know a little hug leads to a foot rub
Then a hot tub
Then a French kiss on a bear rug
Do you like it? Do you like it?
How about this? Wanna try it?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll take that as a yes
It's written all over your face there's no mistake
No guess, no doubt, no beatin' around the bush
Baby it's understood
You wink, I laugh
'Cause we know a little hug leads to a foot rub
Then a hot tub
Then a French kiss on a bear rug
Do you like it? Do you like it?
How about this? Wanna try it?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll take that as a yes
I'll take that as a yes
I'll take that as a yes
'Cause we know a little hug leads to a
Foot rub, hot tub, bear rug, yeah
Wouldn't you love
Wouldn't you love
Wouldn't you love
Yeah, I like it, I like it
Yes
