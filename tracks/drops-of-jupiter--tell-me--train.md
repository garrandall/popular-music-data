Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change
Since the return of her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June
But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded?
And that heaven is overrated
And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?
Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae Bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly
So he never did land
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
Tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?
Can you imagine no love
Pride, deep-fried chicken?
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance?
Freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had and me
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back toward the Milky Way?
And tell me did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded?
And that heaven is overrated
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself?
Na na na
And did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day?
Na na na
And did you fall for a shooting star?
Fall for a shooting star
Na na na
And now you're lonely looking for yourself out there
