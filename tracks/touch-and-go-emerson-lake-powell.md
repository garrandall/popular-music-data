Man in the street nowhere to sleep
No time for nothing no Patek Phillipe
Pedal to the metal Blow by Blow
You're runnin' with the devil it's touch and go
They're leaving you nothing and nowhere to go
Just put you in the corner like an old banjo
The strings are breakin' but you can't say no
You're runnin' with the devil it's touch and go
Systematic one man show
You're caught up in the middle where the four winds blow
No salvation 20 below
You're runnin' with the devil it's touch and go
All systems go friend or foe
It's all dependin' on the dice you throw
Come without a warning like a U.F.O
You're runnin' with the devil it's touch and go
You see this woman on a T.V. show
She's drippin' in diamonds from head to toe
They make you believe it's the status quo
You're runnin' with the devil it's touch and go
All systems go friend or foe
It's all dependin' on the dice you throw
Come without a warning like a U.F.O
You're runnin' with the devil it's touch and go
