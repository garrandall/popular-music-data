Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you, now
You got someone to blame?


You say one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it


Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without


Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One


Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?


Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again


You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt


One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sisters, brothers
One life, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One
One


Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
May we, may we, may we get
Higher
Oh, higher
(Ay, yeah, go) higher
(Oh) Higher
