There's a sudden rise in the mercury
There's a thumpin' in my heart, it just had to be
Heat wave, hurricane, whirling in my head
Cool disposition, just hanging by a thread

Is it a question of love? hah!
Is it a state of mind? no, no, no, no
It's a question of, it's a question of, it's a question of, it's a question of
Of temperature, yeah

I wake up in the morning
Go to sleep at night with the fever
She says "I won't hang you up"
And I say "baby I believe ya"

Is it a question of love? hah!
Is it a state of mind? no, no, no, no
It's a question of, it's a question of, it's a question of, it's a question of
Of temperature, yeah

I'll tell it like it is, girl you gotta keep your distance
Cause the doctor says I've got a very low resistance
Non-stop elevator pushing to the top
No second chance for a temperature drop

Is it a question of love? hah!
Is it a state of mind? no, no, no, no
It's a question of, it's a question of, it's a question of, it's a question of
Of temperature, yeah
