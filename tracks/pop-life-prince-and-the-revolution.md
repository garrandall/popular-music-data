King Shango and Rakaa getting hotta/
Getting in tacka/ Now the whole place locka/

Fya man seh bun dem, bun dem/ Mek wi bun dem,
un dem/ Killing out di daughters and di son dem,
dun dem/ Blaze up di fya mek it bun dem/ Bun out dem
bombs and dem bullets and dem gun dem 


The fire starts with a spark/ Then a shift up in 
the mind/ People scared to be themselves/ Seem happy
to live a lie/ Give thanks for collie weed/ Never ever
sniff a line/ Conquering Lion/ 225th in line/ If we say
we're "Pro-War"/ Only in the fight for peace/ Man, that
means no war/ Think the price of life is cheap?/ But
we're saying "No More" / Righteous recognize the beast/
Fireman'll baptize/ Burn 'em the light and heat/ Forward 
to the power in a phrase like/ "Acts Of God"/ Prophet
said he saw the flood waters rise/ And the flow was hard/
I was really shocked to see/ The truth was exposed as hard/
While the media was focused/ On the words by Kanye/ What 
was it I just heard the President's Mom say?/ People here
are frustrated/ Still got a long way/ Fed up but remember/
Self Destruction is the wrong way


Too much ratat.../ Keep it pon lock if you're gonna use one/
(Remember that)/ Ratat.../ Strictly self defense or for
revolution/ (Remember that)


They think I'm crazy/ But di tables have to turn/ They
think I'm crazy/ But di fya have to burn/ They think
I'm crazy/ But di children have to learn/ They think
I'm crazy/ Wow, wow, oh


Rakaa tell dem seh fi bun dem, bun dem, bun dem, bun dem,
bun dem, bun dem/ If dem kill di daughters and di son dem,
bun dem/ Bun dem out dem bullet and and dem bomb and dem
gun dem/ Wah mi seh fi bun dem, bun dem, bun dem, bun dem, 
bun dem, bun dem/ Serious mi serious ain't makin no fun 
then/ Weh mi seh fi bun dem, bun dem, bun dem, bun dem,
bun dem, bun dem/ Listen to di words weh a come off a mi
tongue/ Rakaa tell mi seh


It's Dilated with the Prophet/ Capleton the Fireman/ 
Visions of the future's clear/ Reign Of Fire in his hand/
Crown Prince Rakaa/ Preacher's son with a higher plan/
Coconut and carrot chalice/ Looking for the kaya man/
Babylon is vexed with us/ They should read Exodus/ Moses
and the burning bush/ Incense in Leviticus/ Lamb's Bread
sacrament/ Check out 1st Corinthians/ Shipped of to 
America/ All through the Caribbean/ No it's not an
accident/ Gangbangin and the dope/ Guns and crack are
lynching youth/ Swinging from a hangman's rope/ Addicts
wanna shoot up/ Pop pills/ Wanna drink and toke/
Automatics spit hot/ You can still se the smoke


Too much ratat.../ Keep it pon lock if you're gonna use one/
(Remember that)/ Ratat.../ Strictly self defense or for
revolution/ (Remember that)


Well bingyman wi haffi mek a decision/ Caan mek dem
distract wi from Jah Jah mission/ Dem a worry bout mi sight
and ask bout mi vision/ Dem want to know weh certain things
it derive from/ From di injustice and di manipultation/
Death without dignity and exploitation/ So mi go, go ask di
wicked man/ Weh dem dem pan/ Why dem haffi build so much
evilous weapon/ So mi go, go ask di wicked man/ Why dem
haffi build so much evilous weapon
