I remember yet before we met
When every night and day I had to live the life of a lonely one
(Lonely one)
I remember meeting you, discovering love could be so true
When shared by two instead of only one
(Only one)

When you said you loved me
(When you said you loved me)
And we could not be parted
(We could not be parted)

I said, I built my world around you
(Built my world around you)
I'm so thankful that I found you

Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
I've never felt like this before
Loving you has made my life so much sweeter than ever

Each night I pray we never part
For the love within my heart grows stronger from day to day
As best I can, how I try to reassure you, satisfy
'Cause I'd be lost if you went away
(Went away)

'Cause I really need you
(Really really need you)
And I need for you to need me too
(Need for you to need me too)

I have built my world around you
(Built my world around you)
I'm so thankful that I found you

Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever, yes it has
Since I'm loving you, my life is so much sweeter than ever

'Cause I really love you
(Really really love you)
Girl, I'm thankful that you love me too
(Thankful that you love me too)

I have built my world around you
(Built my world around you)
And I'm truly glad I found you

Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
You know it has, yes it has
Loving you, since I've been loving you, my life's sweeter than ever
Since I'm loving you, my life is sweeter than ever, yes it has
