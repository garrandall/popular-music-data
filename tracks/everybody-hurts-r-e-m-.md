When the day is long
And the night, the night is yours alone
When you're sure you've had enough
Of this life, well, hang on


Don't let yourself go
'Cause everybody cries
And everybody hurts
Sometimes


Sometimes everything is wrong
Now it's time to sing along
When your day is night alone (Hold on, hold on)
If you feel like letting go (Hold on)
If you think you've had too much
Of this life, well, hang on


'Cause everybody hurts
Take comfort in your friends
And everybody hurts


Don't throw your hand
Oh, no
Don't throw your hand
If you feel like you're alone
No, no, no, you're not alone


If you're on your own in this life
The days and nights are long
When you think you've had too much
Of this life to hang on


Well, everybody hurts
Sometimes, everybody cries
And everybody hurts
Sometimes
And everybody hurts
Sometimes


So, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Everybody hurts
No, no, no, no, no, you're not alone
