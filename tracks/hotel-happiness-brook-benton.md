I'm checking out of Hotel Loneliness
All my lonely days, they're all through
I'm checking into Hotel Happiness (oh, yeah)
Because, darlin', I found you

I left my teardrops in that old lonely room
Left my broken heart (my heart) back there, too
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I won't be needin' them in Hotel Happiness (oh, yeah)
'cause, darling, I found you

I woke up (woke up) dreamin' of your crazy kisses (kisses) (crazy)
I woke up (woke up) tellin' Mr. Misery "Here's your key" 'cause

I'm checking out of Hotel Loneliness
And no, I won't be back, yes it's true
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Gonna make my new address at Hotel Happiness (oh, yeah)
You know why, darlin', so glad I found you

No more, make my new address at Hotel Happiness
'cause, darlin', I found you
