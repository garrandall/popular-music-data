Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring tingle tingling too 
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you, 
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling yoo hoo, 
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you. 

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy and cozy are we 
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two 
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you. 

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy and cozy are we 
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two 
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.
