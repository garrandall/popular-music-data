Hey!
Hey!
Hey!


Itâs 8 A.M.
This hell Iâm in
Seems Iâve crossed the line again
For being nothing more than who I am

So break my bones
And throw your stones
We all know that life ainât fair
But there is more of us
Weâre everywhere


We donât have to take this
Back against the wall
We donât have to take this
We can end it all


All youâll ever be
Is a faded memory of a bully
Make another joke
While they hang another rope
So lonely
Push him to the dirt
âTil the words donât hurt
Can you hear me?
No ones gonna cry
On the very day you die
Youâre a bully

Hey!
Hey!


Think it through
You canât undo
Whenever I see black and blue
I feel the past
I share the bruise

With everyone
Whoâs come and gone
My head is clear
My voice is strong
Now Iâm right here to right the wrong


We donât have to take this
Back against the wall
We donât have to take this
We can end it all


All youâll ever be
Is a faded memory of a bully
Make another joke
While they hang another rope
So lonely
Push him to the dirt
âTil the words donât hurt
Can you hear me?
No ones gonna cry
On the very day you die
Youâre a bully




Itâs 8 A.M.!
The Hell Iâm in!
Your voice is strong!
Now right the wrong!


All youâll ever be
Is a faded memory of a bully.
Make another joke
While they hang another rope
So lonely.
Push him to the dirt
âTil the words donât hurt
Can you hear me?
No ones gonna cry
On the very day you die
Youâre a bully



Hey!
