Good evening
I'd like to thank everybody for coming out
Hope your flights were safe
Feeling real breezy, swift like the wind


It's calling my body, yeah, it's calling my soul
It's calling my mind, girl I gotta go
Baby it's the grind, yes I had a good time
Don't get me wrong, you were so good and I really wish I could
Stay a little bit longer, love you a little bit stronger
And go a little deeper, baby with you
But since this thang is calling I gotta answer dry your eyes
Girl don't cry 'cause you're making it hard for me


'Cause I don't want to leave, oh girl but I gotta go right now
I'll be back to hold you down
I don't want to leave no but girl I gotta go right now
And I'll be back before you know it


So hold that thought, don't you move
See I'm coming right back, right back for you
Don't you change your position, girl I'm on a mission
And baby trust I'll be missing, missing you 'cause I don't wanna leave


'Cause I don't want to leave, oh girl but I gotta go right now
I'll be back to hold you down
I don't want to leave no but girl I gotta go right now
And I'll be back before you know it


Streets be calling me, they be calling my name, baby
And when they call I gotta go, so I'm letting you know
I won't be gone for long
And already, I can't wait to come home to you


I don't want to leave, no baby, but I gotta go right now
I'll be back to hold you down
I don't want to leave no but girl I gotta go right now
And I'll be back before you know it
I don't want to leave, no, but I gotta go right now
I'll be back to hold you down
I don't want to leave, but I gotta go right now
And I'll be back before you know it


Break it down, down, down
Nah, I don't wanna leave
But you know hit it is when-
Whoa, baby, keep that on
Don't take it off
Keep it on so I can take it off when I get back!
*laughs*
Yeah, fa'sho
You better believe that!


I don't want to leave, no baby, but I gotta go right now
I'll be back to hold you down
I don't want to leave no but girl I gotta go right now
And I'll be back before you know it
I don't want to leave, no, but I gotta go right now
I'll be back to hold you down
I don't want to leave, but I gotta go right now
And I'll be back before you know it
