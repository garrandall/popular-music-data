Wanna be a baller, shot caller
Twenty-inch blades on the Impala
Call her, gettin' laid tonight
Swisha rolled tight, got sprayed by Ike
I hit the highway, making money the fly way
But there's got to be a better way!
A better way, better way, yeah


I'm a -- baller, I'm a twenty-inch crawler
Blades on Impala, diamond rottweiller
I-10 hauler, not a leader not a follower
Break these boys off I'mma twenty inch crawler
Bust a left, a right, I'm outta sight I'm throwed
I'm bouncin off the road Iâ€™m in a mode n fo dem throw dem
The chain and charm -- hop out my big body foreign
Chain with the charm can't forget Moet along
I'm hot, find me lookin good, diamonds against my wood
Man it's understood -- got money in my hood
I'm pushing big body can't stop me
For the nine-eight got to sell a million copy
I'mma crawl slow puffin on the Optimo hit the sto'
I'mma go real slow -- puffin indo out the do'
I'mma lit the stash green, man I'm lookin clean
Want remote control screens and nice byzantines


Wanna be a baller, shot caller
Twenty-inch blades on the Impala
Call her, gettin' laid tonight
Swisha rolled tight, got sprayed by Ike
I hit the highway, making money the fly way
But there's got to be a better way!
A better way, better way, yeah


Big ballin, smashin, makin my ends
Smokin big killa gettin high in the Benz
Big ballin, smashin, makin my ends
Smokin big killa gettin high in the Benz
In the wind smoke goes as I crawl down on Vogues
Twenty Lorenzo, smoke all up in my nose
Yo' eyes, get froze, as you see my low
Candy-red, two-do', let my top down slow
Hittin, my remote, sittin, in my shit
Presidential V-12 with that AMG kit
It don't quit, as I get high
From K.C. to H-Town, connectin SouthSide
Now we worldwide, watch me highside
Fat Pat blowin' killa, can't be denied
187 thugs, oh yeah we got love
Blowing sticky green with Flo, Brew and that Bub


Wanna be a baller, shot caller
Twenty-inch blades on the Impala
Call her, gettin' laid tonight
Swisha rolled tight, got sprayed by Ike
I hit the highway, making money the fly way
But there's got to be a better way!
A better way, better way, yeah


Sittin' Fat Down South, rollin Benz on blocks
Mo' scrilla I got, signin' with Shortstop
And that's for real, so tell me how you feel
To make a million dollars out my first record deal
Shortstop -- puttin up your motherfuckin' ear
Really really don't give a fuck and I ain't drinkin on no beer
Codeine what I sip, pistol grip when I ride
Trunk hittin' fo' life baby it's SouthSide
We on a fuckin' mission Expedition Navigator
That's how we be ridin', alligator suitcasin'
Puttin it in your face, and that's for real
Shinin' harder than the grill it's the player Lil' Will
Down with the 2 Low, Yungstar be a thug
So nigga nigga what? I'm down with Mo'Thugs
Mo'Thugs and da Bone, you know it's goin down
Represent that H-Town, pop trunks surround by sound


Wanna be a baller, shot caller
Twenty-inch blades on the Impala
Call her, gettin' laid tonight
Swisha rolled tight, got sprayed by Ike
I hit the highway, making money the fly way
But there's got to be a better way!
A better way, better way, yeah


I gots to get better man, it gots to move on
Switched from Motorola to a PrimeCo phone
Broke in two chrome, now you know no dope pigeon
Used to count my spoke, now these hoes count my inches
Had to get older -- man it got colder
I done got grown and got a chip on my shoulder
Links in Kuwait, got links in Pakistan
Boys don't understand virtual reality Caravan
Double doors marble floors naked hoes around me
Everytime I'm comin' out, niggas they wanna sign me
Got the Lil' Will diamond grills in my grin
Blaze in the Benz and you can't forget DenDen
Boobie diamond Ruby's, I'm watchin' on a movie
Drop the top on Scott, and you know I'm in a jacuzzi
Bourbon and I'm swervin', man it's gettin' hot
My last name Lemmon, drive my tight'um off the lot, David Taylor


Wanna be a baller, shot caller
Twenty-inch blades on the Impala
Call her, gettin' laid tonight
Swisha rolled tight, got sprayed by Ike
I hit the highway, making money the fly way
But there's got to be a better way!
A better way, better way, yeah


I hit the highway
Everything's my way, I parlay
Everyday all day, ain't no way
Boys can't stop as I slide through your neighborhood
Chop chop chop, headed straight to the top
I only play to win -- bout to close up shop
Showstoppin dead end, pimp the pen once again
Peep the message I send
Take these levels that you devils can't comprehend
Big body Benz -- as I floss through the south
Big blue men -- now whatcha talkin about?
Close yo' mouth -- as I settle all scores
Scream and shout -- my similes and metaphors
Mansion doors -- I constantly close
All you hoes -- go and take off your clothes
Lord knows -- ain't no time to play
Commence to fuckin and-a suckin on the H.A.W.K


Wanna be a baller, shot caller
Twenty-inch blades on the Impala
Call her, gettin' laid tonight
Swisha rolled tight, got sprayed by Ike
I hit the highway, making money the fly way
But there's got to be a better way!
A better way, better way, yeah
