Seems, that thinking about what to do
Boy I think about part of you
Is in my nature
Ooooh my temperature goes to rise
And snow so fast, is in my nature

You know it's true I'm part of you
And I'm afraid nothing to do
Baby I call you
Baby I call you
It's been a while and we let's talk
Wish your body that I'll stop
Baby come give to me

No love just s** and a good time
No rough but I guess just a good time
I'don't want no relationship
But now till'get mine
No even want a nature 'cause s** in
You is my nature


Seems, that thinking about what to do
Boy I think about part of you
Is in my nature
Ooooh my temperature goes to rise
And snow so fast, is in my nature

Baby is no secret about the feelin'
That I get when I'm with you
So let's not bug all around
Just come and put it down
Baby, come en satisfy me

No love just s** and a good time
No rough, but I guess just a good time
I'don't want no relationship
But now till'get mine
No even want a nature 'cause s** in
You is my nature

(Rap)


Seems, that thinking about what to do
Boy I think about part of you
Is my nature
Ooooh my temperature goes to rise
And snow so fast, is in my nature


Seems, that thinking about what to do
Boy I think about part of you
Is in my nature
Ooooh my temperature goes to rise
And snow so fast, is in my nature
