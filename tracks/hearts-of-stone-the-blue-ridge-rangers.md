Well, hearts made of stone
Will never break
And the love you give
It just won't take

You can ask them please
Please, please, please break
And all of your love
Is there to take

Well, hearts of stone
Will cause you pain
Although you love them
They'll stop you just the same

You can ask them please
Please, please, please break
And all of your love
Is there to take

But they'll say no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Everybody knows
I thought you knew
Hearts made of stone

Well, hearts of stone
Will cause you pain
Although you love them
Stop you just the same

You can ask them please
Please, please, please, please
And all of your love
Is there to take, yeah

But they'll say no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Everybody knows
I thought you knew
Hearts made of stone
