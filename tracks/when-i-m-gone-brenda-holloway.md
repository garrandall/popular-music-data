What are you gonna do when I'm gone
Whose shoulder are you gonna cry on
What are you gonna do on the day
When I turn my head and just walk away

What are you gonna say to your friends
When the talk around town begins
Will you tell them how you treated me bad
Will you tell them how you made me so sad

'Cause you make some people
Think that you love me a lot
But they just don't know you
And what they see isn't what we've got

We're happy in the public eye
They think you're such a wonderful guy
But they don't know how much you've lied
And they don't know how much I've cried
You're a real Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde

Oh, yeah

You make a pass at
Every girl that you see
Then when they hurt you
You come running and crying to me

I comfort you whenever you're low
And you don't have a place you can go
You put your head on my shoulder to cry
And then you turn around and tell me a lie

And I just can't take it
I've gotta make it now

What are you gonna do when I'm gone
And what are you gonna do when I'm gone
What are you gonna do when I'm gone
What are you gonna do when I'm gone
