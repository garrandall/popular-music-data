There was a little girl
I had planned to marry
This was my love
I didn`t want to share it
I thought that love would
Make my life bright and sunny
She said she couldn`t love me
Cause I didn`t have no money
So, every day, I have to cry some
Every day, I have to cry some
Drive the water from my eyes some
Every day, I have to cry
I had me a girl
And yes, I really loved her
Log on to kill this message
Every night, well, I was
Thinking of her
But you can`t
Mix love with money
Cause if you do
You`re gonna hurt somebody
And every day, I have to cry some
Every day, I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
Every day, I have to cry
Now, Lord, I know
That I`m just a poor man
But is it wrong to love
Cause I`m not a rich man
But you can`t
Mix love with money
Cause every time
It hurts somebody
And every day, I have to cry some
Every day, I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
Every day, I have to cry
But you can`t
Mix love with money
Cause if you do
You`re gonna hurt somebody
Every day, I have to, ooh, cry some
Every day, I have to cry some....
