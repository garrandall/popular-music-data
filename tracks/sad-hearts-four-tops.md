Sad heart
Don't be long
So they sing a sad, sad song
Oh baby
You can take this sad heart
Make it a glad heart

Sad heart
Reminisce
About the love
That the sad heart missed
Oh baby
You can take this sad heart
Make it a glad heart
You know you can

Sad hearts cry, sad heart's sigh
Ever since the day you said goodbye
Oh baby, oh girl
Oh, girl

Sad heart
Been through it all
Can't you hear this sad heart call?
Oh, baby
You can take this sad heart
Make it a glad heart
Ohhh, oh well

Whoa, oh
Sad hearts cry, sad hearts sigh
Ever since the day you said goodbye
Oh baby, oh girl

Whoah
Sad hearts been through it all
Can't you hear this sad heart call?
Oh baby
You can take this sad heart
Make it a glad heart
Take this sad, sad heart
Oh, baby

You can take this sad heart
Make it a glad heart
Take this sad, sad heart
Oh, baby
