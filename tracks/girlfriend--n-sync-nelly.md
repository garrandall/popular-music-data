Uh, Ay, Ay
Uh, Would you be my girl?
Would you be my,
(Would you be my girlfriend?)
Uh, Ay, Yeah

Check it
He don't want you like I want you believe me boo I been told
He don't appreciate you, ma, I can tell by the way he hold you
He don't love you like I do love you
He don't squeeze you like I squeeze
I'll make your neck pop back and in fact I'll buckle your knees (hey)
Okay, baby what's it gon' take for you to be my lady (tell me right now)
I hear your friends say you should
Your parents tell you what's good
Your lil' sista' keep yellin' Nelly, I wish you would

But you hesitatin debatin' whether or not it's real
I ain't shootin game, boo, I'm just tellin you how I feel
I'm diggin everything about you
Your hips an' the way the swing
I hate to see you leave boo, but love to see you walk away

I'll be your personal shrink boo I care what ya think
I bought the Bentely in pink cuz my dough in sync
So tell ya man bye bye and tell 'em you're long (gone)
Ain't no needin' wait up you done found you another (home)
(woo)


I don't know why you care (why you thinkin' bout it mamma?)
He doesn't even know you're there
'Cause he don't love your eyes (no)
And he don't love your smile (no)
Girl you know that ain't fair (c'mon)

In the middle of the night
Is he gonna be by your side?
Or will he run and hide?
You don't know cause things ain't clear
And baby when you cry
Is he gonna stand by your side?
Does the man even know you're alive?
I got an idea

Why don't you be my girlfriend
I'll treat you good (I'll treat you good girl)
I know you hear your friends when they say you should
'Cause if you were my girlfriend
I'd be your shining star
The one to show you where you are
Girl you should be my girlfriend

Does he know what you feel (he know what you feel?)
Are you sure that it's real yeah (are you sure?)
Does he ease your mind (no)
Or does he break your stride?
Did you know that love could be a shield yeah
In the middle of the night (ohhh)
Is he gonna be by your side? (no no - no)
Or will he run and hide?
You don't know cause things ain't clear
And baby when you cry (ooohh)
Is he gonna stand by your side? (no no)
Does the man even know you're alive?
I got an idea (listen girl)

So won't you be my girlfriend (yeah yeah)
I'll treat you good (I'll treat you good girl)
I know you hear your friends when they say you should, baby
'Cause if you were my girlfriend (uh uh uh uh)
I'd be your shining star (I'd be the one to shine for ya, girl)
The one to show you where you are (Check it, ah ah ah ah ah ah)
Girl you should be my girlfriend


I need a fiance cute as Beyonce
Ghetto like Da Brat
Ready to scrap when I say
The talents of Alicia, my fault Ms. Keys
I take the hips off Trina
The lips off Eve
I put ya so high on a pedestal, it might make ya nose bleed
So much ice around ya ankles, and watch ya toes freeze
What's wrong, ma? Ya man ain't bringing ya joy?
Don't trip flip ya scrip to a country boy
Now c'mon

Ever since I saw your face
Nothing in my life has been the same
I walk around just saying your name
Without you my world would end, yeah
I've searched around this whole damn place
And everything says you were meant to be
My girlfriend... oh

(Hey girl)
Why don't you be my girlfriend (yeah)
I'll treat you good (uh)
I know you hear your friends when they say you should
(I know you hear your friends when they say you should)
'Cause if you were my girlfriend (my girlfriend)
I'd be your shining star (be your shining star yeahh)
The one to show you where you are

Girl you should be my girlfriend (you make my heart sing)
Ahh... (uh uh uh uh) you make my heart sing
Ahh... you make my heart sing
Ahh... (uh uh uh uh) my baby, baby, yeah you make my heart sing
Ahh... girl you should be my girlfriend (would you be my)
Girl you should be my girlfriend (would you be my girl)
Girl you should be my girlfriend (would you be my)
Girl you should be my girlfriend...
