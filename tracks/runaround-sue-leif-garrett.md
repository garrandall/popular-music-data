I should have known it from the very start
This girl would leave me with a broken heart
Now listen people what I'm tellin' you
Keep away from a Runaround Sue

I miss her lips and the smile on her face
The touch of her hand and this qirl's warm embrace
So if you don't wanna cry like I do
Keep away from a Runaround Sue
She likes to travel around
She'll love ya and she'll put you down
Now people let me set you wise
Sue goes out with other guys
Here's the moral of the story from the guy who knows
I fell in love and my love still grows
Ask any fool that she ever knew
They'll say
Keep away from a Runaround Sue
She like to travel around

Runaround Sue
