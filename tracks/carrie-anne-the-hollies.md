Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo-doo doo
Hey, Carrie Anne
Hey, Carrie Anne

When we were at school our games were simple
I played the janitor, you played the monitor
Then you played with older boys and prefects
What's the attraction in what they're doing


Hey Carrie Anne
What's your game now, can anybody play
Hey Carrie Anne
What's your game now, can anybody play

You were always something special to me
Quite independent, never caring
You lost your charm as you were aging
Where is your magic disappearing



You're so, so like a woman to me
Oh like a woman to me
So, so like a woman to me
Like a woman to me



People live and learn but you're still learning
You use my mind and I'll be your teacher
When the lesson's over you'll be with me
Then I'll hear the other people saying



Carrie Anne, Carrie Anne, Carrie Anne, Carrie Anne
