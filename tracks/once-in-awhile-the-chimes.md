Many's the day I took for granted 
Breathing the air that sinlenced some 
As the North Wind blew 
With its head of thunder 
Beating its breast with a war drenched song 
Bathe awhile, awash in slumber 
Cry what's left to sleep 
Where you dream of the love you left forever 
But pity no more nor grieve 

For we're the kings of it all 
For the day we were born 
Now we're the kings of the Kilburn High 
Sure we'll always take a drop and we'll never leave a sup 
Your empty glass is but a tear filled eye 
We were the kings of the Kilburn High 

Listen to the sound of dead men dying 
March as they flee but exiled bound 
Their ship once sailed no longer anchors 
For gone is the green 
And their hallowed gound 

Toast to tears of times past glories 
This ageless clock chime stalls 
Where to kiss the lips of that love forgotten 
To fly where no others have soared 

For we're the kings of it all 
For the day we were born 
Now we're the kings of the Kilburn High 
Sure we'll always take a drop and we'll never leave a sup 
Your empty glass is but a tear filled eye 
We were the kings of the Kilburn High 

Toast to tears of times past glories 
This ageless clock chime stalls 
Where to kiss the lips of that love forgotten 
To fly where no others have soared 

For we're the kings of it all 
For the day we were born 
Now we're the kings of the Kilburn High 
Sure we'll always take a drop and we'll never leave a sup 
Your empty glass is but a tear filled eye 
We were the kings of the Kilburn High
