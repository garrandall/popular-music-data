Gunter glieben glausen globen
All right
I got something to say
Yeah, it's better to burn out
Yeah, than fade away
All right
Ow gonna start a fire
C'mon!
Rise up! gather round
Rock this place to the ground
Burn it up let's go for broke
Watch the night go up in smoke

Rock on! Rock on!

Drive me crazier, no serenade
No fire brigade, just Pyromania

What do you want? What do you want?
I want rock'n'roll, yes I do
Long live rock'n'roll

Oh let's go, let's strike a light
We're gonna blow like dynamite
I don't care if it takes all night
Gonna set this town alight

C'mon!

What do you want? What do you want?
I want rock'n'roll, all right!
Long live rock'n'roll

Rock of ages, rock of ages
Still rollin', keep a-rollin'
Rock of ages, rock of ages
Still rollin', rock'n'rollin'

We got the power, got the glory
Just say you need it and if you need it
Say yeah!

Heh heh heh heh
Now listen to me
I'm burnin', burnin', I got the fever
I know for sure, there ain't no cure
So feel it, don't fight it, go with the flow
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme one more for the road

What do you want? What do you want?
I want rock'n'roll, You betcha
Long live rock'n'roll

Rock of ages, rock of ages
Still rollin', keep a-rollin'
Rock of ages, rock of ages
Still rollin', rock'n'rollin'

We got the power, got the glory
Just say you need it and if you need it
Say yeah!
Say yeah!

We're gonna burn this damn place down
Down to the ground

Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh
