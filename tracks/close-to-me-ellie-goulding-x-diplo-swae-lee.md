Even though we both know we're liars and we start each other's fires
We just know that we'll be alright
Even though we're kicked out the party 'cause we both hate everybody
We're the ones they wanna be like

So don't let me down
Keep me in trouble
Born to be wild
Out in the jungle

And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me
And if it wasn't you, I wouldn't want anybody
Close to me
'Cause I'm an animal, animal-al
Like animal, like you
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me


You can never come too close for comfort
I had to cut my bitch off, she bein' stubborn (Stubborn)
I make it known I fuck with you, not undercover ('Cover)
And when I jump in, I'm burnin' rubber (Yeah, skrrt)
Iced out body, didn't go to college (Yeah, yeah)
Price tag poppin', then you on the private (Then you on a)
Don't say "Sorry," everyone's watchin' (Everyone)
When you're where I am, everything's timeless (Yeah, yeah)


And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me
And if it wasn't you, I wouldn't want anybody
Close to me
'Cause I'm an animal, animal-al
Like animal, like you
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me
Close to me
Close to me
Yeah

Animal, animal-al
Like animal, like you

And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me
And if it wasn't you, I wouldn't want anybody
Close to me
Because I'm an animal, animal-al
Like animal, like you
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me
Close to me
(To me)
Close to me
