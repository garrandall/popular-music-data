The worst person I know Mother-In-Law Mother-In-Law
She worries me so Mother-In-Law Mother-In-Law
If she leaves us alone we would have a happy home
Sent from down below Mother-In-Law Mother-In-Law
Mother-In-Law Mother-In-Law

I come home with my pay Mother-In-Law Mother-In-Law
She AX me what I MADE Mother-In-Law Mother-In-Law
She thinks her advice is a contribution but
if she will leave that will be the solution
and don't come back no more Mother-In-Law Mother-In-Law
Mother-In-Law Mother-In-Law

SATAN (Sin) should be her name Mother-In-Law Mother-In-Law
To me there about the same Mother-In-Law Mother-In-Law
Every time I open my mouth She steps in and tries to put me out
How could she stoop so low Mother-In-Law Mother-In-Law
Mother-In-Law Mother-In-Law
