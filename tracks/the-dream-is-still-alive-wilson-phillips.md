Not so long ago we were so in phase
You and I could never forget the days
But then the fire seemed to flicker
Cold wind came and it carried us away
But we'll get back someday, baby

The dream is still alive
Look here in my eyes
Can you see what I'm feeling?
The dream is still alive
The one of you and I
And my heartache is healing
I couldn't let it die
No I knew it would survive
The dream is still alive

Not so long ago in a purple haze
People dreamed out loud they were not afraid
They stopped the war but not the dying
Some got a little bit lost along the way
But somehow we're here today
And we say

The dream is still alive
After all this time
The flame keeps on burning
The dream is still alive
The one of you and I
And my heart keeps returning
I couldn't let it die
No I knew it would survive
The dream is, the dream is still alive

Oh yeah.

The dream is still alive
Look here in my eyes
Can you see what I'm feeling
The dream is still alive
The one of you and I
And my heartache is healing
I couldn't let it die
For all the times we tried
The dream is still alive
