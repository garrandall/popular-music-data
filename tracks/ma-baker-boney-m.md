Freeze! I'm Ma Baker
Put your hands in the air and give me all your money!

This is the story of Ma Baker
The meanest cat from old Chicago town


She was the meanest cat
In old Chicago town
She was the meanest cat
She really mowed them down
She had no heart at all
No, no, no heart at all

She was the meanest cat
Oh, she was really tough
She left her husband flat
He wasn't tough enough
She took her boys along
'Cause they were mean and strong


(Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma)
Ma Baker
She taught her four sons
(Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma)
Ma Baker
To handle their guns
(Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma)
Ma Baker
She never could cry
(Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma)
Ma Baker
But she knew how to die


They left a trail of crime
Across the U.S.A
And when one boy was killed
She really made them pay
She had no heart at all
No, no, no heart at all


(Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma)
Ma Baker
She taught her four sons
(Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma)
Ma Baker
To handle their guns
(Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma)
Ma Baker
She never could cry
(Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma)
Ma Baker
But she knew how to die


Then came a man she liked
She thought she'd stay with him
When he informed on them
They did away with him
She didn't care at all
Just didn't care at all


Here is a special bulletin
Ma Baker is the FBI's most wanted woman
Her photo is hanging on every post office wall
If you have any information about this woman
Please contact the nearest police station

Don't anybody move!
The money or your lives!


One day they robbed a bank
It was their last foray
The cops appeared too soon
They couldn't get away

And all the loot they had
It made them mighty mad
And so they shot it out
Ma Baker and her sons

They didn't want to hang
They died with blazing guns
And so the story ends
Of one who left no friends


(Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma)
Ma Baker
She taught her four sons
(Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma)
Ma Baker
To handle their guns
(Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma)
Ma Baker
She never could cry
(Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma)
Ma Baker
But she knew how to die
