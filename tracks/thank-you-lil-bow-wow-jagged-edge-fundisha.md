If you ever bought a tape
Purchased a C.D or a piece of vinyl
Dj'd my record
Promoted my record
I wanna thank ya'll man from the bottom of my heart
Secondly, I wanna dedicate this song to ya'll man
Cause without ya there is no me

I could never turn my back on ya'll cause ya'll put me where I'm at
So when you call I'll be there just like that
Signing autographs, givin daps to all my folks
Telling little kids don't follow these dopes
See I'ma keep barking as long as ya'll bark with me
You Know the website all you gotta do is hit me, man
As much as the girls like me
You'd think it make fellas sick
But they be right with'em
Singing not missin a lick
Hair braided rocking somebodies jersey
From up top to out west
And down in the dirty
Can't forget about the midwest
Cause that's where I was found
That's where I live and Columbus is the town
I got the pen
You got the paper
A c.d. a tape
I sign it then leave and get a nice big plate of fish which is my favorite
Dish But without ya'll I couldn't kick it like this

I wanna thank you
For making me who I am and putting me where I need to be
I wanna thank you
For the opputunity to do my thang in this industry
I wanna thank you
For callin to your local stations day after day to play my song
If it wasn't for you there wouldn't be no me and thats why
I wanna ride for you
Forever More ... I just wanna thank you

I wanna thank you for the groups that came before me
All of ya'll in the office that promote me on the streets
All the mom and pop store that don't get alot of credit
The spots in the hood the first ones that said it
All the mix show d'js please keep it pumpin
Thank you for your support and yes I'm gonna keep it comin
I love how you love that
So I'm givin back
Cause ya the ones that kept this playa on track
The reason I'm seen
Is because of you
The reason I'm heard and my dreams came true
Now if you ever made a poster or wrote a fan letter
All I'm try'n do is show you some L-O-V-E
And that you know without ya there is no me
JD, JE, the whole SSD
Know if you ride for we Then I'ma ride for you
From the bottom of my heart baby tell 'em what I wanna do
