Disco- disco- disco-mania
Disco- disco- disco-mania
When the music turns me on
I want to hold my baby tight
Disco- disco- disco-mania
Disco- disco- disco-mania

Disco music has the beat
That makes me want to dance all night

I want to dance up close to you all night
Let's boogie til we set this place on fire

Aww baby
My heart is filled with love and desire for you
So come on boy and do what you gotta to
It's started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it burning out of control
So come on boy and satisfy this need in me
Cause only your good lovin can set me free

I like to watch your body when we dance
A disco is the place to find romance

Disco oh disco
That's where the happy people go
And they're just dancing along
To a party song
Down at the disco

There's music, music, music everywhere
Oh I love my music, music in the air
Music for the sound of the sired
Music for the beat of the drumming
Music in the cymbals clash
That's music
Music for a movie
Or when you're feeling groovy
Music there to help you start the day
Sweet music

Come on girl let's funk the night away
I shake it better when I hear you say
Shake shake shake
Shake shake shake
Shake your booty
Shake your booty
Aw shake shake shake
Shake shake shake
Shake your booty
Shake your booty

Lets move together like we did before
I never get enough I need some more

She's crazy  like a fool
What about daddy cool
I'm crazy like a fool
What about daddy cool
Daddy, daddy cool
Daddy, daddy cool

I love to hear the funky disco sound
I love it when it turn the beat around
Turn the beat around (Turn it around)
Love to hear percussion
Turn it upside down
Love to hear percussion

Disco- disco- disco-mania
Disco- disco- disco-mania
When the music turns me on
I want to hold my baby tight
Disco- disco- disco-mania
Disco- disco- disco-mania
Disco music has the beat
That makes me want to dance all night
Disco- disco- disco-mania
Disco- disco- disco-mania
From my head down to my feet
I feel the beat all over me
Disco- disco- disco-mania
Disco- disco- disco-mania
