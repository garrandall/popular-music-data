Slip n' slide, push it in 
Bitch sure got the rhythm 
I'm holding back, yeah, I got control 
Hooked into her system 
Don't draw the line 
Honey, I ain't through with you 
The harder the better 
Let's do it 'til we're black and blue 
Well, you never know when love will come 
Gotta get it while you got it 
A little bit of everything, even when it hurts 
Sure feels good 
Don't draw the line 
Honey, I ain't through with you 
The harder the better 
Let's do it 'til we're black and blue 
Yo mama! 
Black and blue 
Black and blue, yo mama! 
Black and blue 
Gotta, gotta, gotta, get it right 
Black and blue 
Don't draw the line 
Honey, I ain't through with you 
The harder the better 
We'll do it 'til we're black and blue 
Don't draw the line 
Baby, I ain't through with you 
The harder the better 
Let's do it 'til we're black and blue 
The wetter the better 
Let's do it 'til we're black and blue 
Do it 'til we're black and blue 
The wetter the better 
Let's do it 'til we're black and blue
