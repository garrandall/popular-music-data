I know that winning
It doesn't come easy
I know that winning
It's what's on your mind
It's what's on your mind

I know you want it
A gift from the angels
Colors of the rainbow
You're hoping to find
You're hoping to find

Someone's gonna take it
And I'm the one

And I got just one more
Chance for Heaven
One more mountain to climb
And I got just one more
Chance for Heaven
Putting it all on the line
Putting it all on the line

It's out there waiting
Waiting ro find us
The spirit deep inside
Oh just set it free
Just set it free

A chance for Heaven
That place we dream of
And when you get there
Oh then you will see
Oh then you will see

Now it's one more
Chance for Heaven
One more mountain to climb
Now it's one more
Chance for Heaven
Putting it all on the line
Putting it all on the line

History is not destiny

I know that winning
It never comes easy
And on the day you get there

Oh you're gonna find
Oh you're gonna find

Someone's gonna take it
Someone's gonna make it
And you're the one

There'll always be
One more chance for Heaven
One more mountain to climb
There'll always be
One more chance for Heaven
Putting it all on the line

There'll always be
One more chance for Heaven
One more mountain to climb
There'll always be
One more chance for Heaven
Putting it all on the line

There'll always be
One more chance for Heaven
One more mountain to climb
