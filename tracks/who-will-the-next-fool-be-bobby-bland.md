After you get rid of me
Tell me who will the next fool be

I know, I know, I know
There's things about you
They'd like to know

After all is said and done
You won't be satisfied with anyone
So after you get rid of me, baby
Tell me who will the next fool be

Will he believe all of those lies
End up like me with
Tears all in his eyes

I know, I know, I know
And I'd like to be
The one to tell him so

After all is said and done
You won't be satisfied with anyone
So now after you get rid of me, baby
Woah, who will the next fool be

One more, one more time
After you get rid of me, baby
Lord, who will the next fool be
