It ain't complicated
Well, I've grown to hate it
I never liked the taste of crow, but baby, I ate it
They tried to warn me
They said that you were ornery
So don't bring me those big brown eyes and tell me that you're sorry
Well, you might as well throw gasoline on a fire
The way you lie


You lie like a priceless Persian rug on a rich man's floor
Well, you lie like a coon dog basking in the sunshine on my porch
Well, you lie like a penny in the parking lot at the grocery store
It just comes way too natural to you
The way you lie


That ain't my perfume
I bet she had a curfew
You told me you were out with the boys and baby, I believed you
So why you lookin' so nervous?
You know you're gonna deserve this
I oughta kill you right now and do the whole wide world a service
Well, my daddy's gonna straighten you out like a piece of wire, like a piece of wire
The way you lie


You lie like the man with the slick back hair who sold me that Ford
Well, you lie like the pine tree in the back yard after last month's storm
Well, you lie like a penny in the parking lot at the grocery store
It just comes way too natural to you
The way you lie


Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna drive to the big ol' muddy river
I'm gonna park my car in the middle of the mile-long bridge
And then I'm not gonna cry, well, maybe just a little
Then I'm gonna slip off the ring that you put on my finger
Give it a big ol' fling and watch it sink
Down, down, down
And there it's gonna lie
Until the Lord comes back around


Because you lie like a priceless Persian rug on a rich man's floor
Well, you lie like a coon dog basking in the sunshine on my porch
Well, you lie like a penny in the parking lot at the grocery store
It just comes so dang natural to you
The way you lie
The way you lie
Well, it's what you do, it's who you are
