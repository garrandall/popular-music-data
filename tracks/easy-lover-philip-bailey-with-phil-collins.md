Easy lover
She'll get a hold on you believe it
Like no other
Before you know it you'll be on your knees
She's an easy lover
She'll take your heart but you won't feel it
She's like no other
And I'm just trying to make you see


She's the kind of girl you dream of
Dream of keeping hold of
You'd better forget it
You'll never get it
She will play around and leave you
Leave you and deceive you
Better forget it
Oh you'll regret it


No you'll never change her, so leave it, leave it
Get out quick cause seeing is believing
It's the only way
You'll ever know, oh


She's an easy lover
She'll get a hold on you believe it
Like no other
Before you know it you'll be on your knees
She's an easy lover
She'll take your heart but you won't feel it
She's like no other
And I'm just trying to make you see


You're the one that wants to hold her
Hold her and control her
You'd better forget it
You'll never get it
Oh she'll say that there's no other
Till she finds another
Better forget it
Oh you'll regret it


And don't try to change her, just leave it, leave it
You're not the only one, ooh seeing is believing
It's the only way
You'll ever know, oh




Now don't try to change her, just leave it, leave it
You're not the only one, cause seeing is believing
It's the only way
You'll ever know, oh


She's an easy lover
She'll get a hold on you believe it
She's like no other
Before you know it you'll be on your knees
(You'll be down on your knees)
She's an easy lover
She'll take your heart but you won't feel it
She's like no other
And I'm just trying to make you see
(Trying to make you see, yeah)

She's an easy lover
She'll get a hold on you believe it
(Get a hold on you)
Like no other
Before you know it you'll be on your knees
(You'll be on your knees)
She's an easy lover
She'll take your heart but you won't feel it
(You won't feel it)
She's like no other
And I'm just trying to make you see
(Trying to make you see)

She's an easy lover
She'll get a hold on you believe it...
