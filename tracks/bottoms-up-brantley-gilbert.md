I see you and me riding like Bonnie and Clyde
Going ninety five burning down one twenty nine yeah
Looking for the law, while I push my luck
She's riding shot gun like it ain't no thing
Turn the radio up so the girl can sing right
Pull into the party like, "Y'all wassup"

Tonight is bottoms up
Throw it on down
Rock this quiet little country town
Get up
Drop the tailgate on ya truck
Find a keg and fill ya cup up
Kick it on back
Pretty little mama looking at ya like that
Make ya wanna slide on in like, "Girl, what's up"
Yeah tonight is bottoms up (up up)
Get em up
Tonight is bottoms up (up up)
Get em up
Damn

Girl I gotta tip my hat
Never thought a country song make you move like that
And she's doing it in daisy dukes
Girl she's got ya tapping on a boys shoulder
Hey dog check this out
Man, it's how them girls do it in the dirty south
She'll have you on your knee, "Can I marry you?"

Yeah tonight is bottoms up
Throw it on down
Rock this quiet little country town
Get up
Drop the tailgate on ya truck
Find a keg and fill ya cup up
Kick it on back
Pretty little mama looking at ya like that
Make ya wanna slide on in like, "Girl, what's up"
Yeah tonight is bottoms up
Get em up
Tonight is bottoms up
Get em up, get em up, get em up

Get em up

Hey y'all whatever ya sipping on,
Get it up in the air one time
Bottoms up

Let's give a toast to the good times
All y'all get your drinks up high
Everybody feeling alright
Damn right

'Cause tonight it's bottoms up
Throw it on down
Rock this quiet little country town
And get up, drop the tailgate on ya truck
Find a keg and fill ya cup up
Kick it on back
Pretty little mama looking at ya like that
Make ya wanna slide on in like, "Girl, what's up"

Tonight is bottoms up
Throw it on down
Rock this quiet little country town
And get up, drop the tailgate on ya truck
Find a keg and fill ya cup up
Kick it on back
Pretty little mama looking at ya like that
Make ya wanna slide on in like, "Girl, what's up"
Yeah tonight is bottoms up
Get em up
Tonight is bottoms up
Get em up
