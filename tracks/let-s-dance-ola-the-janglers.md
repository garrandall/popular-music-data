A two
A one two three four

Hey baby won't you take a chance
Say that you'll let me have this dance
Well let's dance
Let's dance
We do the twist the stomp the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do
But let's dance
Let's dance

Hey baby yeah you thrill me so
Hold me tight don't you let me go
But let's dance
Let's dance
We do the twist the stomp the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do
But let's dance
Let's dance

All right
Yeah
Wooo

Hey baby if you're all alone
Maybe you'll let me walk you home
But let's dance
Let's dance
We do the twist the stomp the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do
But let's dance
Let's dance

Hey baby things are swinging right
Yes I know that this is the night
Let's dance
Let's dance
We do the twist the stomp the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do
But let's dance
Let's dance

Let's dance yeah
Let's dance
Let's dance
