Another Friday night
There's a line of cars leaving
Home team's got an out-of-towner
Me, I'm sitting on the hood of mine drinking
I'm just a parking lot down-and-outer

Under that high school bleacher
I drove that preacher's daughter crazy
Her mama was my homeroom teacher
And her dad was hell bent on saving me

Yeah, I'm sure there's higher highs
Where the high risers rise
But me, I'm gonna sit right here tonight, and

Catch me a 'round here buzz
Cause you ain't 'round here none
Keep putting 'em down here, 'nother round here
'Til my down goes up
Lit up like that one stoplight
Across from that welcome sign
Ever since you caught that out there bug
I catch me a 'round here buzz

I never had big-city eyes
Hell, I've never been east of Dallas
Got no idea where you are now
Or if you ever got that penthouse palace

No, Scotty's ain't got no vibe
Got no gas in his neon light
But he's got two-for-one 'til 2:00 tonight

Catch me a 'round here buzz
Cause you ain't 'round here none
Keep putting 'em down here, 'nother round here
'Til my down goes up
Lit up like that one stoplight
Across from that welcome sign
Ever since you caught that out there bug
I catch me a 'round here buzz

Catch me a 'round here buzz
Cause you ain't 'round here none
Keep putting 'em down here, 'nother round here
'Til my down here
Is lit up like that one stoplight
Across from that welcome sign
Ever since you caught that out there bug
I catch me a 'round here buzz
I catch me a 'round here buzz
'Round here buzz
I catch me a 'round here buzz
