Put on you're high-heel sneakers, on that wig down on you're head
Put on you're high-heel sneakers, on that wig down on you're head
'Cause we're goin' out tonight baby, oo-oo, I'm pretty sure you're gonna knock 'em dead

Put on you're red dress baby, 'cause we're goin' out tonight, come on now!
Put on you're red dress baby, we gonna go out tonight
And I'm gonna sharpen up my razor
'Cause some cats might wanna fight

Put on you're high-heel sneakers, on that wig down on you're head, come on now!
Put on you're high-heel sneakers, honey why don't you put that wig down on you're head, whooo!
'Cause we're goin' out tonight baby, oh oh, I'm pretty sure you're gonna knock 'em dead

Put on you're red dress baby, 'cause we're goin' out tonight, yeeaahh come on now!
Put on you're red dress baby, we gonna go out tonight
And I'm gonna sharpen up my razor
'Cause some cats might wanna fight
