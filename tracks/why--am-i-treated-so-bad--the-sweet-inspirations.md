Oh oh oh


The love affair ended
The love affair ended
The love affair ended when we said "I do"

Walking on our way
Heard somebody say
"Why marry?
I'm in love with you
You're in love with me
So why marry?"


Daddy, proudly, gives me away
Wedding and best man
Champagne and cake


Ohhh
The love affair ended when we said "I do"
The love affair ended when we said "I do"

Everything is right, so right
Nothing's ever wrong
Why marry?
Love is always here
And the need is strong
Why marry?


And then a beautiful ring ????
Loving and living together was hip (?)


Ohhh
The love affair ended when we said "I do"
The love affair ended when we said "I do"


The love affair ended
The love affair ended
The love affair ended when we said "I do"

Sunshine, flowers
Yours, mine, ours

Ohhh
The love affair ended when we said "I do"
The love affair ended when we said "I do"
The love affair ended when we said "I do"
The love affair ended when we said "I do"
The love affair ended when we said "I do"
The love affair ended when we said "I do"
The love affair ended when we said "I do"
The love affair ended when we said "I do"

The love, the love ended when we said I do


Listen baby, we got to
Kind to get down to some facts
You know... everything's wrong
Nothing ever seems to get right, huh
But we're married
You're always gone and I'm all alone at night
But we're married
All I've got to look forward to is..
Dishes and a closet full of brooms
We've gotten to the place that
We're even sleeping in separate bedrooms
And we both should know that the love affair ended
When we said "I do"


The love affair ended when we said "I do"
