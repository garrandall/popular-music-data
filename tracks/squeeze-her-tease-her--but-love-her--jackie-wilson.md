(Hey-hey-hey, talk about a- hey hey hey)

When you are in love
And your love is true
And thereâs no one else
around to view
Man, you got to
(squeeze her)
Youâve gotta tease (tease her)
Youâve gotta tell her â I love you
Darlinâ, I love you (I love you)

When youâre on the dance floor
And you work it out
Man, you gotta DO more
Than jump and shout
Man, you got to
(squeeze her)
Youâve gotta tease (tease her)
Youâve gotta tell her â I love you
Yeah, I love you (I love you)

You know that night time
is the right time when
Youâre in love
And especially when
The moon is
Shining bright above
And if push â comes to shove
And youâre feeling blue
Remember little man
What I told you to do

When youâre walkinâ her home
From a movie show
You whisper in her ear
And she says ânoâ

Man, you got to
(squeeze her)
Youâve gotta tease (tease her)
Youâve gotta tell her â I love you
Darlinâ, I love you (I love you)

Hey I love you
I love you
