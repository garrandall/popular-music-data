When you are in love
And your love is true
And there's no one else
Around to view
Man, you got to
(Squeeze her)
You've gotta tease (tease her)
You've gotta tell her – I love you
Darlin', I love you (I love you)

When you're on the dance floor
And you work it out
Man, you gotta DO more
Than jump and shout
Man, you got to
(Squeeze her)
You've gotta tease (tease her)
You've gotta tell her – I love you
Yeah, I love you (I love you)

You know that night time
Is the right time when
You're in love
And especially when
The moon is
Shining bright above
And if push – comes to shove
And you're feeling blue
Remember little man
What I told you to do

When you're walkin' her home
From a movie show
You whisper in her ear
And she says "no"

Man, you got to
(Squeeze her)
You've gotta tease (tease her)
You've gotta tell her – I love you
Darlin', I love you (I love you)

Hey I love you
I love you
