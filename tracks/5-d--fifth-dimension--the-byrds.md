Oh how is it that I could come out to here
And be still floating
And never hit bottom and keep falling through
Just relaxed and paying attention

All my two dimensional boundaries were gone
I had lost to them badly
I saw the world crumble and thought I was dead
But I found my senses still working

And as I continued to drop through the hole
I found all the surrounding
To show me the joy that innocently is
Just be quiet and feel it around you

And I opened my heart to the whole universe
And I found it was loving
And I saw the great blunder my teacher's had made
Scientific delirium madness

I will keep falling as long as I live
All without ending
And I will remember the place that is now
That has ended before the beginning

Oh how is it that I could come out to here
And be still floating
And never hit bottom and keep falling through
Just relaxed and paying attention
