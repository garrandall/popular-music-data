Some people dance cheek to cheek
Some people dance

Life was so simple then
A kind of playtime
You made it easy then
We had a great time

I try not to talk too fast
Like you do when you fall in love
But some people let their passion scream
And some people understand their dream

Life was so simple then
A kind of playtime
You made it easy then
We had a great time

Some people dance cheek to cheek
Some people dance

Life was so simple then
A kind of playtime
You made it easy then
We had a great time

I take you somewhere different
It's only me can see the change
'Cause some people are tied to emotion
And some people understand their dream

Life was so simple then
A kind of playtime
You made it easy then
We had a great time

Some people dance cheek to cheek
Some people dance

Life was so simple then
A kind of playtime
You made it easy then
We had a show time

Some people dance cheek to cheek
Some people dance

Some people dance cheek to cheek
Some people dance

Some people
