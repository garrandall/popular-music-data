What if I said yes
What if I'd gone out that night
What if you'd turned left
Everything would've turned out alright
What if I'd spoke up
What'd if I'd took the keys
What if I had tried a little harder instead of always trying to please

Joey I'm so sorry
Ohh can you hear me
Joey I'm so sorry

What if I'd said no
What if we'd never fell in love
What if we'd gone slow
Or a little be faster and broken up

Would I know this hurt
Would I feel this pain
Do you know that with all I have left in my very last breath I will call your name

Joey I'm so sorry
Ohoohoh can you hear me?
Joey I'm so sorry

Were you sad
Were you scared
Did you wish for a prayer to be free
Was it quiet and cold
Was it light or too dark to see
And did you reach for me

Joey I'm so sorry
Ohh can you hear me?
Joey I'm so sorry
Oohhhohh can you hear me
Joey I'm so...
Joey I'm so..... sorry
