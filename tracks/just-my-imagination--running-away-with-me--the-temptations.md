Each day through my window
I watch as how she passes by
I said to myself
'your such a lucky guy
To have a good girl like her
It's truly your dream come true
Out of all the fellows in the world
She belongs to you'
But it was just my imagination
Running away with me
It was just my imagination
Running away with me

Soon we'll be married
And raise a family oh yeah
In a cosy little home
In the country
Where two children maybe for real
Until you rise
I can feel you eyes on all
This couldn't be a dream
For too real it all seems
But it was just my imagination (once again)

Running away with me
Tell you it's just my imagination
Running away with me

Every night, on my knees I pray,
Dear Lord, hear my plea...
Don't ever let another
Take her love from me
Or I will surely die... '
Ooh, her love is heavenly;
When her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody...
But in reality,
She doesn't even know me
But in reality she doesn't really know me

It was just my imagination, running away with me running, running, running, running, running
Babe it was just my imagination running away with me
It was just my imagination running away with me (hold me)
Just my imagination
Running away with me
