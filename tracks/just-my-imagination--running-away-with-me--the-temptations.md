Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by
I say to myself you're such a lucky guy
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
Out of all the fellows in the world she belongs to me


But it was Just my imagination, runnin' away with me
It was just my imagination runnin' away with me


Soon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah)
A cozy little home out in the country with two children, maybe three
I tell you I can visualize it all
This couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems


But it was just my imagination once again runnin' away with me
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me


Every night on my knees I pray, Dear Lord, hear my plea
Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die
Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me
I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me


Just my imagination once again runnin' away with me
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I can't forget her
Just my imagination once again runnin' away with me
Just my imagination runnin' away with me
