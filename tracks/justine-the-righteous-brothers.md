Justine

Justine, Justine
Yeah, you just don't treat me right

Justine, Justine
You just don't treat me right
You like to ball in the mornin'
And stay out late at night

Goin' to the barber shop
Gonna have them do me up
Gonna get clean for my little buttercup

Justine, Justine
Yeah, you just don't treat me right
You like to ball in the mornin'
And stay out late at night

Hey, ho
Hey, ho
Ho

Justine, Justine
Justine, Justine
You like to ball in the mornin'
And stay out late at night

Do you feel all right?
(Yes, I feel all right)
Do you feel all right now, yeah?
(Yes, I feel all right)
I wanna know, I wanna know, yeah, yeah
(Yes, I feel all right)

Do you feel all right now?
(Yes, I feel all right)
Do you feel all right?
(Yes, I feel all right)
Do you feel all right, yeah?
(Yes, I feel all right)

Goin' to the barber shop
Gonna have them do me up
Gonna get clean for my little buttercup

Justine, Justine
Yeah, you just don't treat me right
You like to ball in the mornin'
And stay out late at night

Justine, Justine
Justine, Justine
Justine, Justine

Justine, Justine
You like to ball in the mornin'
And stay out late at night
Hey
