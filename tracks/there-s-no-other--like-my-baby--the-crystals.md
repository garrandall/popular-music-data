There's a story I want you to know
'Bout my baby, how I love him so

There's no other like my baby
No, no, no, no
(I wanna tell you now)
There's no other, don't mean maybe
No, no, no, no

Walkin' down the street, in a crowd
Looking at my baby, feeling so proud
Woah, oh, oh

There's no other like my baby
No, no, no, no

While at a dance, my baby by my side
He whispers to me, someday I'll be his bride
Woah, oh, oh

There's no other like my baby
No, no, no, no

(Johnny?)
No, no, not like my baby
(Billy?)
No, not like my baby
(Bobby?)
He's not like my baby

I wanna tell you now
There's no other like my baby
No, no, no, no
