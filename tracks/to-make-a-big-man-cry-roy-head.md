It only takes a little girl
To make a big man cry
She only has to take his heart
Break his heart, telling him goodbye

To make a big man cry
It's easy to do
To make a big man cry
Just tell him you're through
And then, watch him cry

She's got the power to sink him
In the winking of an eye
She only has to shake it off
And break it off, for no reason why

To make a big man cry
It's easy to do
To make a big man cry
Just tell him you're through
And then, watch him cry

(Yes, boy, it's easy to do)
Watch him cry
(Yes, boy, it can happen to you)
Watch him cry
(You know what he's saying is true)

Because it happened to me
(Because it happened to me)
Just take a look, you'll see
(Just take a look and you'll see)
I'm only part of the man
Only half of the man, I used to be
I know

It only takes a little girl
To make a big man cry
She only has to lead him on
And when she's gone, he'll just wanna die

To make a big man cry
It's easy to do
To make a big man cry
Just tell him you're through
And then, watch him cry

(Watch the big man cry)
Watch the big man cry
(Watch the big man cry)
Just watch me cry
(Watch the big man cry)
Watch him cry
(Watch the big man cry)
