I remember waiting for the school bus
Jenny Clayton was my first crush
And neither one of us had a clue
An old Cheyenne it was my first truck
Rusted, rough and kinda beat up
But when she jumped in it felt brand new


And now these days when I drive through a small town
I turn my stereo up and roll my windows down


’Cause it reminds me of my first kiss
And those days that I always miss
Tom Petty on the radio
Going steady with nowhere to go
No money just time to spend
An old Chevy and a couple friends
Oh how I wish that I could go back in time

Just to love you again


I remember drinking from the same cup
We’d break up just to make up
I remember falling in love with you
Smokin’ cigarettes on the tailgate
Man it seems like it was yesterday
When Main Street felt like Park Avenue


And when I’m driving through any ol’ small town
I turn my stereo up and roll my windows down


’Cause it reminds me of my first kiss
And those times that I always miss
Tom Petty on the radio
Going steady with nowhere to go
No money just time to spend
An old Chevy and a couple friends
Oh how I wish that I could go back in time


When forever felt like it would never come
And we never thought we’d turn 21
So young we thought this could never end
Oh how I wish we could go back again


And now that time has taken over
And we can’t fight this getting older
But somehow baby we made it through
And every time I’m a lookin’ at you


’Cause it reminds me of my first kiss
And those days that I always miss
Tom Petty on the radio
Going steady with nowhere to go
No money just time to spend
An old Chevy and a couple friends
Oh how I wish that I could go back in time


Just to love you again
Just to love you again
Just to love you again
Just to love you again
Oh how I wish that I could go back in time
