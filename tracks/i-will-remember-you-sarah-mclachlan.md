I will remember you 
Will you remember me? 
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories.

I'm so tired
I can't sleep
Standing on the edge of something 
Much to deep.

It's funny how we feel so much 
And cannot say a word 
We're screaming inside 
But we can't be heard

I will remember you 
Will you remember me? 
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories.

So afraid to love you
More afraid to loose 
Clinging to past
That doesn't let me choose.

Well, once there was a darkness
A deep and endless night
You gave me everything 
You gave me light.

I will remember you 
Will you remember me? 
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories.

Remember all
The good times that we had
Let them slip away from us
And things got bad.

Clearly I first saw you
Smiling in the sun
I want to feel your warmth 
I want to be the one.

I will remember you 
Will you remember me? 
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories.

I will remember you 
Will you remember me? 
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories.

Weep not for the memories.

The memories...
