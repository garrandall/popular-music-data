You give your hand to me
And then you say, "Hello"
And I can hardly speak
My heart is beating so
And anyone can tell
You think you know me well
Well, you don't know me no
No you don't know the one
Who dreams of you each night
And longs to kiss your lips
And longs to hold you tight
To you I'm just a friend
That's all I've ever been
No you don't know me


I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you, yeah
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by
A chance that you might love me too


You give your hand to me
And then you say, "Goodbye"
And I watched you walk away
Beside the lucky guy
No you'll never ever know
The one who loved you so
No you don't know me


I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you, yeah
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by
A chance that you might love me too


You give your hand to me
And then you say, "Goodbye"
And I watched you walk away
Beside the lucky guy
No you'll never ever know
The one who loved you so
No you don't know me


I say you never ever know
The one who loved you so
No you don't know me
No you don't love me
