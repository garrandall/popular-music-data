I'm goin down to the river and drown myself, well
I'm goin down to the river and drown myself
Oh babe, oh I'm goin down yes and turn myself in,
Cause my baby's lovin someone else
Now you know why I'm goin down to the river and drown
Myself

I'm sick and tired of this misery down in my heart,
Way down in my heart
I'm sick and tired of this misery down in my heart, oh
Lord
Well I'm sick and tired of this misery, lord have
Mercy, have mercy on me
I'm sick and tired of this misery down in my heart

So goodbye baby ( bye baby ) well I got to go, so
Please dont cry, cause its too late to cry
Bye bye baby well I got to go, so please dont cry,
Oh no
Oh bye bye baby, I've got to go, thats why I called
You, just to let you know
I'm goin down to the river and drown myself
