Say, you, over there
Please come here
Say, you, over there
Don't be afraid

Say, you, over there
My name is Ronnie
I think you're
Gonna be my girl

Tonight, mister moon
Shines his light
Tonight, be mine
Let me hold you tight

Tonight your lips
Glisten so bright
I think you're
Gonna be my girl

I know we're strangers
From different places
And it doesn't seem right at all
But when I saw your angel face
I couldn't help but call

Say, you, you are
The one for me
Say, you
I'll treat you tenderly

Say, you
Oh, this just had to be
I think you're
Gonna be my girl

My girl
(Say, you are my girl)
