A-plink a chunk, oh oh
Oh, a-plink a chunk, oh oh
Oh, a-plink a chunk

I wait with open arms
(A-plink a chunk)
Down by the river
Where the boats comes in

(A-plink a chunk)
And when the boats come in
I run to him with open arms
(A-plink a chunk)

Although he's on the shore
(A-plink a chunk)
His heart is still
A hundred miles at sea

(A-plink a chunk)
But then he kisses me
And I can tell
He's mine once more

All night I hold him tight
He's mine until the dawn
Then when the fishing boats
Go out again he's gone
Gone away and

I pray all through the day
(A-plink a chunk)
That he'll return
And make my life begin

(A-plink a chunk)
And when his boat comes in
I run to him with open arms
(Down by the river)
(Where the boats come in)

All night I hold him tight
He's mine until the dawn
Then when the fishing boats
Go out again he's gone
Gone away and

I pray all through the day
(A-plink a chunk)
That he'll return
And make my life begin

(A-plink a chunk)
And when his boat comes in
I run to him with

(With open arms)
Open
(With open arms)
Arms

Down by the river
Where the boats come in
A-plink a chunk
