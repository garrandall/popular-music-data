Well I was feelin' so bad
So I asked my family doctor 'bout what I had
I said now doc (doctor)
Mister MD (doctor)
Oh can you tell me (doctor)
What's ailing in me (doctor)

Chorus
He said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
All you need
All you really need
Is good lovin'
Gotta have lovin'
Good lovin'
Everybody gotta have lovin'
Good lovin'
Gimme, gimme some lovin'
Good lovin'

So come on baby, well squeeze me tight
Don't you want your daddy to feel alright
Well I said now baby (baby)
Well it's for sure (baby)
I got the fever (baby)
And you got the cure (baby)
