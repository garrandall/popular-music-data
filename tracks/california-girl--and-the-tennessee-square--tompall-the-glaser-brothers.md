She ponders the mysteries
Of the universe
And fills my head
With prose and verse
The beads she wears do please my eyes
As well as her long straight hair
But the things she says are alien to...
The likes of this Tennessee square

But my California girl's alright
My California girl's okay
If she finds herself I just hope she'll care...
For the love of a Tennessee square

Her soft sweet lips
Reflect the sound
Of Dylan & Thoreau
And the underground
Her silken beauty pleases me
As well as her long straight hair
With love in his heart and his mind confused...
So goes the Tennessee square

But my California girl's alright
My California girl's okay
If she finds herself I just hope she'll care...
For the love of a Tennessee square
