Brrah-dah-dah-dah
Brrah-dah-dah-dah

They call me Megatron
Just did a telethon
He got Margielas on 
And I get my jealous on
I fuck him like I miss him
He just came out of prison
Bitches be talkin' shit 
But they ain't got a pot to piss in
My name is Nicki M
I'm in a sticky Benz
That mean it's candy apple red 
I'm Barbie, this is Ken
That is a Fendi fact
I'm with the hunnid mags
Oh, this is custom-made, Donatella sent me that

Feel up, baby, feel on me
Pull up if you're feeling lonely
Feel up, baby, feel on me
Pull up if you're feeling lonely

Brrah-dah-dah-dah
Shot-shot-shots I'm drinkin'
It's better when I'm drinkin'
I tune up when I'm drinkin'
Rum, rum when I'm
Brrah-dah-dah-dah
Shot-shot-shots I'm drinkin'
It's better when I'm drinkin'
I tune up when I'm drinkin'
Rum, rum when I'm

Brrah-dah-dah-dah
Brrah-dah-dah-dah
Brrah-dah-dah-dah

They call me Megatron
Shorty's a mega con
It ain't about the race either, it's the marathon
I put the squeeze on him
Throw up the Bs on him
That ass clappin' on the D, Hercules on him
My name is Baddie Baddie
I keep it tight for zaddy
He keep me cummin', cummin' 
He ain't even drop the Addy
Trunk in the front-front
I need a blunt-blunt
I own my own Moscato, bitch, we gettin' drunk-drunk

Feel up, baby, feel on me
Pull up if you're feeling lonely
Feel up, baby, feel on me
Pull up if you're feeling lonely

Brrah-dah-dah-dah
Shot-shot-shots I'm drinkin'
It's better when I'm drinkin'
I tune up when I'm drinkin'
Rum, rum when I'm
Brrah-dah-dah-dah
Shot-shot-shots I'm drinkin'
It's better when I'm drinkin'
I tune up when I'm drinkin'
Rum, rum when I'm

Brrah-dah-dah-dah
Brrah-dah-dah-dah
Brrah-dah-dah-dah

Bite me, bite me, that excite me
He said, "It's my pussy", yeah, it might be
If you eatin' it, do it precisely
'Cause I'm a millionaire, this pussy pricey
Yeah, it might be, yeah, it might be
He said, "It's my pussy", yeah, it might be
My-my pussâ my-my pussy, yeah-yeah, it might be
'Cause I'm a millionaire, this pussy pricey

Feel up, baby, feel on me
Pull up if you're feeling lonely
Feel up, baby, feel on me
Pull up if you're feeling lonely

Brrah-dah-dah-dah
Shot-shot-shots I'm drinkin'
It's better when I'm drinkin'
I tune up when I'm drinkin'
Rum, rum when I'm
Brrah-dah-dah-dah
Shot-shot-shots I'm brah-dah-dah-dah
Shot-shot-shots I'm brah-dah-dah-dah
Shot-shot-shots I'm drinkin'
Rum, rum when I'm
