Are you ready?

If you ain't got no money take your broke ass home.
You say, "If you ain't got no money take your broke ass home."

G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S.
G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S.

We flying the first class
Up in the sky.
Poppin' champagne,
Livin' the life
In the fast lane,
And I won't change
By the glamorous, oh, the flossy flossy

The glamorous
The glamorous, glamorous (the glamorous life)
By the glamorous, oh, the flossy flossy
The glamorous
The glamorous, glamorous (the glamorous life)
By the glamorous, oh, the flossy flossy

Wear them gold and diamonds rings
All them things don't mean a thing
Chaperons and limousines
Shopping for expensive things

I be on the movie screens
Magazines and bougie scenes
I'm not clean, I'm not pristine
I'm no queen, I'm no machine

I still go to Taco Bell
Drive through, raw as hell
I don't care, I'm still real
No matter how many records I sell

After the show or after the Grammies
I like to go cool out with the family
Sippin', reminiscing on days
When I had a Mustang
And now I'm in...

We flying the first class
Up in the sky.
Poppin' champagne,
Livin' the life
In the fast lane.
And I won't change
By the glamorous, oh, the flossy flossy.

The glamorous
The glamorous, glamorous (the glamorous life)
By the glamorous, oh, the flossy flossy
The glamorous
The glamorous, glamorous (the glamorous life)
By the glamorous, oh, the flossy flossy


I'm talking Champagne wishes, caviar dreams
You deserve nothing but all the finer things
Now this whole world has no clue what to do with us
I've got enough money in the bank for the two of us
Plus I gotta keep enough lettuce
To support your shoe fetish
Lifestyles so rich and famous
Robin Leach will get jealous
Half a million for the stones
Taking trips from here to Rome
So If you ain't got no money take your broke ass home

G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S
G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S

We flying the first class
Up in the sky.
Poppin' champagne,
Livin' the life
In the fast lane.
I won't change
By the glamorous, oh, the flossy flossy.

The glamorous
The glamorous, glamorous (the glamorous life)
By the glamorous, oh, the flossy flossy.
The glamorous
The glamorous, glamorous (the glamorous life)
By the glamorous, oh, the flossy flossy.

I got problems up to here
I've got people in my ear
Telling me these crazy things
That I don't want to know (fuck y'all)

I've got money in the bank
And I'd really like to thank
All the fans, I'd like to thank
Thank you really though

'Cause I remember yesterday
When I dreamt about the days
When I'd rock on MTV,
That'd be really dope

Damn, It's been a long road
And the industry is cold
I'm glad my daddy told me so,
He let his daughter know

(If you ain't got no money take your broke ass home)
My daddy told me so
(If you ain't got no money take your broke ass home)
He let his daughter know
(I said if you ain't got no money take your broke ass home)
My daddy told me so
(If you ain't go no money take your broke ass home)
He let his daughter know
