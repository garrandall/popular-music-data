Now everybody
Have you heard
If you're in the game
Then the stroke's the word

Don't take no rhythm
Don't take no style
Got a thirst for killing 
Grab your vile

Put your right hand out
Give a firm handshake
Talk to me
About the one big break

Spread the ear pollution
Both far and wide
Keep your contributions
By your side

And stroke me, stroke me
Could be a winner boy you move quite well
Stroke me, stroke me
(Stroke)
Stroke me, stroke me
You got your number down
Stroke me, stroke me
Say you're a winner
But man you're just a sinner now

Put your left foot out
Keep it all in place
Work your way
Right into my face

First you try to bed me
You make my backbone slide
When you find you've bled me
Skip on by

Keep on stroke me, stroke me
Give me the business all night long
Stroke me, stroke me
(Stroke)
Stroke me, stroke me
You're so together boy
Stroke me, stroke me
Say you're a winner
But man you're just a sinner now

Stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke

Better listen now
Said it ain't no joke
Let your conscience fail ya'
Just do the stroke

Don't ya' take no chances
Keep your eye on top
Do your fancy dances
You can't stop

You just stroke me, stroke me
(Stroke, stroke)
Stroke me, stroke me
(Stroke, stroke)

Stroke me, stroke me
(Stroke, stroke)
Stroke me, stroke me
(Stroke)

Do it

Stroke me, stroke me
(Stroke)
Stroke me, stroke me
Keep on
(Stroke)

Stroke me, stroke me
(Stroke)
Stroke me, stroke me
Say you're a winner
But man you're just a sinner now
