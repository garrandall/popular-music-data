Ha ha, yeah, Big Bub, nine seven
Yo Latifah, do you


We used to dream of a nice hot cruise for weeks
While my high sex drive rocks you to sleep
Watching mystic continuously
Your stock rose immediately when you was with me
You wanted the lace, the leather
Since the days I had the jetta
You chased the chedder
And like whatever we face and whether double ballers
They ain't no playa's till they saw us
Pushing the tall bus tell 'em we're twin porche's


Girl I am diggin you you're diggin me
Let's make this happen
The things I want to do to you
Your mind just can't imagine
I want to show you bigger faces
Take you diffent places
I need you in my life
So baby won't you be my lady


I want your love (yeah)
I need your love
I need you with me
I want your love (yeah)
I need your love
Oh, baby

I'm on another level
Can't you see that I'm no player
Meet your desires, take you higher like an elevator
And here's the bottom line
No one can ever love you better
If you like what you're hearing
Girl let's get together

I want your love (oh yeah)
I need your love
I need you with me
I want your love (yeah)
I need your love
I'll give a million dollars to have you babe

I want your love (oh yeah, yeah)
I need your love
Because I need your love, yeah
I want your love (oh yeah)
I need your love
Heavy heavy heavy yeah


Hey yo boo
You take some time and vibe with me
Now jump in the car and ride with me
She said water bed I like when you inside of me
Cuz you belly all big and you so fly to me
Now shorty takes trips and various whips
Her phone flips likes style lavish
Playin' the cabin, word the mother
That's my nigga Big Bub
I want your love, I need your love


Whoa baby, yeah
I want your love (yeah)
I need your love
I'll give a million dollars to have you
I want your love (Yes I will baby)
I need your love (Know I will be there)
Ohhh, I need your love

I want your love (Cuz I need your love)
I need your love (cuz I need your love)
I want you in my life baby
I want your love (yeah)
I need your love
Baby baby baby follow me
Because I nee dyou
Gotta have your love
I need you

I want your love
I need your love (oh, yeah)
