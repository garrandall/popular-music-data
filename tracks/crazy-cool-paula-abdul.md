Sitting, chilling, thinking about you babe
You're like a long, cool glass of lemonade - mmm
Bitter, sweet and I want you so bad it hurts
You complete my life and you quench my thirst--sexy

Sexy feelings just come over me
Playing with my dress like a summer breeze
Gentle as the touch of a falling leaf
You open me up to love
Now I gotta believe, gotta believe


Nothing's too good for my baby
Anything you want be free
It's the least that I can do
What you've given me, given me


Cause I'm cool, Crazy Cool,  Crazy cool with you
In this -uh-groove, Crazy groove
Baby act a fool
Hey I'm cool,  Crazy Cool, You're crazy cool with me
In this groove, Crazy Cool, Everything you need, SEXY

Laying in the grass, writing poetry
Looking up at the midnight sun
While you're making love to me

You showed me just how cool Crazy Cool can be
Now I know meaning of ecstasy, ecstasy





Nothing's too good for my baby
Anything you want be free
You open me up to love
oh I Gotta Believe
