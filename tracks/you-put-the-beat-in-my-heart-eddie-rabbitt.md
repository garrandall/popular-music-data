I thought it might be the guitar
I thought it might be the drum
Or somebody out in the hall
Snappin' thumbs

Well, I felt your eyes talkin' to me
I felt it right through my heart
I knew what it had to be
That was pound, pound
Poundin' in me

Baby, you put the beat in my heart
Baby, you put the beat in my heart

I've heard that same melody
But love never really moved in me
'Til you put the beat in my heart

I thought I heard someone knockin'
Or footsteps in the hall
Or maybe it was a branch
Blowin' on the window pane

When you were layin' beside me
Soft as the mornin' light
I knew the sound I was hearin'
Now started in your arms last night

Baby, you put the beat in my heart
Baby, you put the beat in my heart

I've heard that same melody
But love never really moved in me
'Til you put the beat in my heart

Put the beat in my heart
You, you put the beat in my heart
Don't you know that
You put the beat in my heart

I know I've heard that same melody
But love never really moved in me
'Til you put the beat in my heart

My heart, my heart
You put the beat in my heart
You put the beat in my heart
You put the beat in my heart
It was you, you
It was you, you
You put the beat in my heart
Can't you hear it
Can't you hear it, baby

How do you do it, baby
It never, never felt so right
My heart's on it's knee
I'm beggin' you please
Just keep it, keep it up all night

You, you put the beat in my heart
Don't you know that
You put the beat in my heart

I know that I've heard that same old melody
But love never really moved in me
'Til you put the beat in my heart

Put it back
Put it back

You put the beat in my heart, baby
You put the beat in my heart
You put the beat
You put the beat
You put the beat in my heart
My heart, yeah
