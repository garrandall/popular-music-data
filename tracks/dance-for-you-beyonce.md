I just wanna show you how much I appreciate you, yes
Wanna show you how much I'm dedicated to you, yes
Wanna show you how much I will forever be true, yes
Wanna show you how much you got your girl feeling good, yes
Wanna show you how much, how much you understood, yes
Wanna show you how much I value what you say
Not only are you loyal, you're patient with me babe, yes
Wanna show you how much I really care about your heart
Wanna show you how much I hate being apart, yes
Wanna show you show you show you till you through with me
I wanna keep it how it is but you can never say how it used to be!


Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch!


Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy, I like it when you watch me, ah
Tonight it's going down
I'll be rocking on my babe, rocking, rocking on my babe
Swirling on my babe, swirling, swirling on my babe
Baby, let me put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
'Cause it's about to go down


You'll never need two 'cause I will be your number one
Them other chicks are superficial
But I know you know I'm the one
That's why I'm all into you
'Cause I can recognize that you know that
That's why I'm backing this thing back
Pop-popping this thing back
Drop, drop, drop-dropping this thing back
This is for the time you gave me flowers
For the world that is ours
For the mula, for the power of love
And no I won't never ever e-ever give you up
And I wanna say thank you in case I don't thank you enough
A woman in the street and a freak in the you know what
Sit back, sit back, it's the pre-game show
Daddy, you know what's up


Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch


Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy, I like it when you watch me, ah
Tonight it's going down
I'll be rocking on my babe, rocking, rocking on my babe
I'll be swirling on my babe, swirling, swirling on you, babe
I wanna put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
'Cause it's about to go down


I'm a take this time to show you how much you mean to me
'Cause you are all I need
No money can emphasize
Or describe
The love that's in-between the lines
Boy look into my eyes
While I'm grinding on you
This is beyond sex
I'm high on you
If it's real then you know how I feel
Rocking on you, babe, rocking, rocking on you, babe
Swirling on you, babe
In my mind all I can think about is a frame for our future
And the pictures of the past and a chance to make this love last


Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah
Tonight it's going down
I'll be rocking on my babe, rocking, rocking on my babe
I'll be swirling on my babe, swirling, swirling on my babe
I wanna put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
'Cause it's about to go down


Watch me p-pop it, p-pop it for you, baby
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it for you, baby
Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch me roll it, baby
Wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch me
Watch me p-pop it, p-pop it for you, baby
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it for you, baby
Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch me roll it, baby
Wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch me
