He promises you things'll be different
If you just give him one more try
Want so bad to believe
Though you know it's just another lie

Wants to know if he can come over
And that he's sorry 'bout the other night
Though your mind says no
Your heart tells him it's alright

Deep in the night
Promises you love forever
Don't you know better, girl
Than to believe a man

In the heat of the night (Heat of the night)
There's nothin' but promises (Heat of the night)
Heat of the night (Heat of the night)
Be careful, baby (Heat of the night), whoa

He starts with touching you all over
Whispering sweet nothings in your ear
Though you know it's jive
At the time it's what you want to hear

I am intelligent enough to know better
But you just for a moment get weak
As nature takes control
And you start to feel the heat, oh, hoo, hoo

Then the next day you're wondering why
"Why me, oh, why me"
You got caught, baby
With your defenses down

In the heat of the night (Heat of the night)
Nothin' but lies (Heat of the night)
heat of the night (Heat of the night), whoa
Heat of the night, baby (Heat of the night), whoa

His passion made you think
He loved only you
When he slipped and cried out another woman's name
You shoulda knew

You'll never see the truth
Till he's through (He's just been usin' you)
You should have known better, girl
Than to believe a man

In the heat of the night, baby (Heat of the night)
There's nothin' but promises (Heat of the night)
Heat of the night (Heat of the night)
Baby, why must you get burned to learn (Heat of the night)

In the heat of the night (Heat of the night)
There's nothin' but promises (Heat of the night)
You shoulda known better, girl (Heat of the night)
Than to believe a man in the heat of the night (Heat of the night), whoa

(Heat of the night)
(Heat of the night)
