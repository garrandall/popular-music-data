What’cha gonna do, what’cha gonna say
When the groove comes around the way
Just relax and let it flow
We got the bump from the bass shaking your front door
It’ll keep you begging for more
So, get your groove on


So many people around the room
I cannot believe
Everybody’s dancing
Nobody’s trippin’
Plenty of fine men to rock my world


What’cha gonna do, what’cha gonna say
When the groove comes around the way
Just relax and let it flow
We got the bump from the bass shaking your front door
It’ll keep you begging for more
So, get your groove on


It’s time to hit the floor
Cus the DJ’s playing my favorite song
Sing (What’cha gonna do, What’cha gonna say)
When the music hits you
You


What’cha gonna do, what’cha gonna say
When the groove comes around the way
Just relax and let it flow
We got the bump from the bass shaking your front door
It’ll keep you begging for more
So, get your groove on


Oh, oh oh oh oh oh
You over there
See you watching me
As I roll sexily in my 850
Tempo’s up on my feet
Got you checking in my eeoow
Only way I roll is if you come in first class
Always get the man with the Barcellini hat
The one with the Babati, the rocked out versache
With the gators on your feet
A real bammer bammer true player from the street


What’cha gonna do, what’cha gonna say
When the groove comes around the way
Just relax and let it flow
We got the bump from the bass shaking your front door
It’ll keep you begging for more
So, get your groove on


Get your groove
Make your body move
Keep it funkay
