The Declaration Of Independence
Think I can tell you that first sentence
But then I'm lost

I can't begin to count the theories
I've had pounded in my head that I forgot

I don't remember all that Spanish
Or the Gettysburg address
But there is one speech from high school
I'll never forget

"Come on in, boy, sit on down
And tell me 'bout yourself.
So you like my daughter, do you now?
Yeah, we think she's something else.
She's her daddy's girl, her mama's world.
She deserves respect,
That's what she'll get.
Ain't it, son?
Now y'all run along and have some fun.

I'll see you when you get back.
Bet I'll be up all night
Still cleaning this gun."

Well, now that I'm a father,
I'm scared to death one day my daughter
Is gonna find
That teenage boy I used to be,
Who seems to have just one thing on his mind.

She's growing up so fast. It won't be long
Before I'll have to put the fear of God
Into some kid at the door.

"Yeah, come on in, boy, sit on down
And tell me 'bout yourself.
So, you like my daughter, do you now?
Yeah, we think she's something else.

She's her daddy's girl, her mama's world.
She deserves respect,
That's what she'll get,
Now, ain't it, son?
Now y'all go out and have some fun

I'll see you when you get back.
Probably be up all night
Still cleaning this gun."

Now it's all for show. Ain't nobody gonna get hurt.
It's just a daddy thing, andâhey, believe me, manâit works.

"Yeah, come on in, boy, sit on down
And tell me 'bout yourself.
So, you like my daughter, do you now?
Yeah, we think she's something else.

She's her daddy's girl, her mama's world.
She deserves respect.
That's what she'll get,
Ain't it, son?
Y'all run along and have a little fun.

I'll see you when you get back.
Probably be up all night
Still cleaning this gun."

Eh, son, now ya'll buckle up and have her back by tenâawâlet's say about nine-thirty. Drive safe.
