I seen him on facebook
I seen on the other thing
I seen him on youtube
Hes got his own show on fucking BBC three man
I haven't even got my own show on BBC three

People of Wales have a new icon
Let me tell you about a rap phenomenon
Hes not from the Bronx or the NYC
Hes from the Valleys and he's called Biggie
Locally he's know for his snap backs
And what he says in his home made raps
He spits lyrics on demand
Some of them you can even understand
He tells how it is without any flannel
And uploads it to his youtube channel
He branched out to everyones surprise
Even did a sex tape and then apologised
So theres no doubt about this Im sure
He'll go down in Welsh folk law
You've heard his name so say it again
Hes the king of welsh rap he's ABM

ABM say it again
ABM say it again

He does the Echo Falls challenge in his flat
He does the funny trick with his hat
See him on facebook he's gonna hypnotise
Man mountain from the Valleys with the bonk eyes
Follow him now before he blows up (bang)
Literally he don't give a fuck
Check out his rap skills on Spotify
He looks kind of ill but he's not ready to die

Fee Fi Fo mother fucking fum
When it comes to the Valleys he's number one
Finds it so easy downing bottles of Lambrini
If he's ever in the port I hope he comes to see me
Big like the beats doing meets and greets
Eating chips on the Tonypandy streets
Moves like Rhianna soul like Boys To Men
Make room on the dance floor for ABM

ABM say it again
ABM say it again

Biggie Biggie Biggie's got what you need
Believe check out his facebook live feed
Others can try but won't succeed
And in the ring he boxes like Apollo Creed
Give him props he's the top of the scales
The dopes mother fucker right now in Wales
He might need some help with his speech
But what he says yo you can't teach
He's got rap skills just like 2 Pac
He looks like he's gonna have a heart attack
He flips his hat like he's a magician
Start a petition Biggie for Eurovision
He does PAs soirees and birthdays
And when he gets on it he's on it for days
So give praise to this rap don
Hes electric on stage like a pylon
Andrew Biggie Morris the leader of men
But for short call him ABM
ABM it's not anti ballistic missiles
Its Andrew Biggie Morris man

ABM say it again
ABM say it again

He says like loads of things and he says loads of words
And I don't even understand what he's saying
But he says them all and everyone watched him
And they go yeah thats wicked
I never been to Tonypandy before but I'm fucking going now
Im, going to stay up the Dunraven Hotel on holiday man
Hes bigger than Tom Jones man well literally like
Im going to the turberville arms man
I can see him in the car park
Wicked they sell kronenbourg like for two quid
You wait he'll have a song in the charts next
