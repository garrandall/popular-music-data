I'm coming home to your loving heart
Till the one that I was
True way and broke apart

I want you I need you
A chance is on I'm asking now
I must get back to you so now
So I am coming home to you
'cause I am nothing without you
May be you found somebody new
'cause I'm still coming home to you

Please let me stay and forget your pride
Now my world is falling round
I got know when behind

I want you I need you
I know with true I made you cry
Then like a fool I say goodbye
Now I am coming home to you
Yes I am nothing without you
May be you found somebody new
But I'm still coming home to you
