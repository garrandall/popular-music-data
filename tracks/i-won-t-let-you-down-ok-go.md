I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
I won't let you down, my love
I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
I won't let you down, my love


Now, Nikki, she's got no flag to fly
But she don't seem that much to mind
No, she don't seem to mind
And you, you got your armor on
Lights out in Babylon
Yeah, lights out in Babylon


But maybe all you need is someone to trust
Maybe all you need is someone
Maybe all you need is someone to trust
Maybe all you need is someone


And I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
I won't let you down, my love
I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
I won't let you down, my love


No, I won't let you down (Won't let you down)
Won't let you down (Won't let you down)
Won't let you down (Won't let you down)
No, I won't let you down (Won't let you down)
Won't let you down (Won't let you down)
Won't let you down (Won't let you down)


Now, Emily's got no tricks to try
But she don't seem that much to mind
She don't seem to mind that much to me
And you got what the whole world wants
So strap that armor tighter on
Double on down like it's gonna make you free


But maybe all you need is someone to trust
Maybe all you need is someone
Maybe all you need is someone to trust
Maybe all you need is someone


And I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
I won't let you down, my love
I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
I won't let you down, my love


No, I won't let you down (Won't let you down)
Won't let you down (Won't let you down)
Won't let you down (Won't let you down)
No, I won't let you down (Won't let you down)
Won't let you down (Won't let you down)
Won't let you down (Won't let you down)


I won't let you down, baby
I won't let you down, baby


I won't let, I won't let you down
(I won't let you down, no, I won't let you down)
I won't let you down
(I won't let you down my love)
I won't let you down
I won't let
(I won't let you down)
I won't let you down, my love
(No, I won't let you down)
I won't let you down, my love
(I won't let you down my love)
I won't let you down
(I won't let you down)
I won't let you
I won't let you
(No, I won't let you down)
I won't let you down
I won't let you down, my love
(I won't let you down my love)
