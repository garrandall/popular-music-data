Just the way playas play)
(Every day, all day)
Yeah, playas play

(Just the way playas play)
(Every day, all day)
Oh, yeah

I've been hustling hard all week
So my pockets are tight
I gots to kick it tonight

There's a party going on
I know it's gonna be jumping
I called the V.I.P
And let em know I'm coming

Now I'll be there
In the freshest wear
It ain't nothing
But a thing to me

I just wanna have a good time
Relax my mind
And maybe creep
With something fine

You know, you know
(Just the way playas play)
Playas play
(Every day, all day)
Now you know how we do it
It's just the way playas play

(Just the way playas play)
(Every day, all day)
Every day, all day, yeah

When I pull up to the joint
The ladies stop and point
(Oh, go ahead baby)
(Oh, go ahead baby)

What's your name, pretty lady
Top40db: The most accurate lyrics site on the net
Don't be acting shady
(I like your style)
Oh, yes, I do
(Get with you for a while)

It's just a party
Girl, don't hurt nobody
Let's just have fun

I just wanna have a good time
Relax my mind
And maybe creep
With something fine

(Just the way playas play)
Oh, yeah (every day, all day)
Now you know how we do it
It's just the way playas play

(Just the way playas play)
Every day (every day, all day)
Just the way we play
Every day, all day, come on

(Just the way playas play)
Yeah (every day, all day)
Oh, oh, playas play, yeah

(Just the way playas play)
Oh, yeah(every day, all day)
Every day, all day

Check it, sit back
And let me do my thing
I know what time it is
From the hands on my Breitling

Every time I bust a rhyme
It remains raw to the core
No rules, I'm breaking the law

Who brings the ruckus
Def Squad's in charge
Don't ever think
About playing my entourage

A real monte getters
Real Lex whippers
Benz whippers
Land coo's whippers
Hard hitters
Mind your business

(It's just the way playas play)
Playas play (every day, all day)
Every day, all day
Playas play

(Just the way playas play)
Yeah (every day, all day)
Every day...

(Just the way playas play)
(Every day, all day)...
