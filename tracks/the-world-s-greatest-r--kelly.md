It's the world's greatest, y'all
It's the world's greatest
The world's greatest


I am a mountain
I am a tall tree, oh
I am a swift wind
Sweepin' the country
I am a river
Down in the valley, oh
I am a vision
And I can see clearly


If anybody ask you who I am
Just stand up tall
Look 'em in the face and say


I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest


I am a giant
I am an eagle, oh
I am a lion
Down in the jungle
I am a marchin' band
I am the people, oh
I am a helpin' hand
I am a hero


If anybody ask you who I am
Just stand up tall
Look 'em in the face and say

I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest


In the ring of life, I'll reign love
And the world will notice a king
Wherever there's darkness I'll shine a light
And the mirrors of success reflect in me


I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest


I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest


I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest


I saw the light
At the end of a tunnel
Believe in the pot of gold
At the end of the rainbow
And faith was right there
To pull me through, yeah
Used to be locked doors
Now I can just walk on through


It's the greatest
Can you feel it?
Say the greatest
Can you feel it?


I saw the light
At the end of a tunnel
Believe in the pot of gold
At the end of the rainbow
And faith was right there
To pull me through, yeah
Used to be locked doors
Now I can just walk on through
Hey
Uh Hey
It's the greatest
I'm that star up in the sky


I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest
