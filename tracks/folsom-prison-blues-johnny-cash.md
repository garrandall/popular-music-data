I hear that train a comin', rollin' around the bend
I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, time keeps draggin' by
But when I hear that train a movin'
God, I hang, I hang, I hang my head and cry

You know, I bet there's rich folks eatin' in a fancy dining car
They're drinking Jack Daniels whiskey, smoking big caboose cigars
Stuck in Folsom prison, time keeps draggin' on
Every time I think of them women
God, I think of good ol' San Antone, yeah

Well, now when I was just a baby, baby, my mama told me
Son, you oughta be a good boy, Jerry, don't ever play with guns
Shot a boy in Memphis, I didn't mean just to watch him die
Oh, when I think of good ol' Memphis, Tennessee
I hang my head and I cry

Now if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
I'd move it on just a little further down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where ol' killer needs to be
'Cos them women keep on movin'

My God, they ain't gonna free me from this prison
And that railroad train ain't mine
I know they're never gonna let ol' Jerry get no further down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I ain't gonna be
Woo, them women keep on movin'
