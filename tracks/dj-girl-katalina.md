All right, everybody
I need one line
One line
I need eight dollars and a picture ID
Or else you're not getting in


Excuse me?
Excuse me?
Let me through please
I'm with the DJ
I'm with the DJ, ok?


Heh
Sure you know the DJ
Sure you do
Everybody's on the guest list


Excuse me?
Excuse me?
(Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me?)
Excuse me?
Excuse me, Mr. Bouncer?


My baby's spinning
It's a packed dance floor
My heart is pumping
Crying out for more

The beat is heavy
Any boy could be mine
So move on over
I'm the DJ's girl


Excuse me?
Let me through, please?


Eight bucks, honey


What?
Eight dollars?
No way
I'm on the guest list
I'm with the DJ

Look, I don't have time to stand out here
And talk about your little problems
Like, why do you think I have these records?
Do you think I dress like this for fun?

Excuse me?
Like were you not listening to me
Or what?
This is way out of hand
Like I'm so sure

What do you mean?
Check the guest list again
Mr. Bouncer-head muscle-man
I'm with the DJ


No, I don't think so, baby
I'm the man
You're not getting in


Hey, stupid steroid-face
Eight dollars?
I'm not gonna pay your dumb little cover charge
I'm with the DJ
I'm with the DJ
I'm with the DJ, ok?



Oh, oh ooh
I'm the DJ's girl
Oh, oh,ooh
I'm the DJ's girl


All right, everybody
One solid line
I need eight dollars and a picture ID
Or else you're not getting in


Excuse me?
Excuse me, Mr. Bouncer?


Heh
Why don't you go home, you little groupie?
You're wasting my time


Excuse me?
Excuse me, Mr. Bouncer?


I need eight bucks and a picture ID


Look
If you value your stupid little job
You better get outta my way
Cause I'm with the DJ

What?
Oh my God
I'm so sure
Like in a million years
You are so dead

Like, why do you think I have these records?
Do you think I dress like this for fun?
Excuse me?
Like were you not listening to me
Or what?

This is way out of hand
Like I'm so sure
What do you mean?

Check the guest list again
Mr. Bouncer-head muscle-man
I'm with the DJ
I'm with the DJ, ok?



So move on over
I'm the DJ's girl
