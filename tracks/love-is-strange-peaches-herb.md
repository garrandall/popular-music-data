Baby, could we have the same table we had yesterday

Woo, oh oohohoh

Here we are again
Sipping our drinks just like friends
I wonder if they see the sparkle in your eyes
I wonder if they know that I'm not your guy, mmm, hm

I wonder if they see
That you don't belong tome
Wish that you could be mine
Mine, all mine, mmm…mmm…

It'll be hard for him to understand
I am his friend and he is your man
I wonder what my lady would say
If she knew I met you everyday, mmm, hm

Sooner or later
Don't you know they're gonna find out and they'll hate us
Oh, I wish that you could be mine
Mine, all mine, mmm…

It's two a.m., the place is gonna close
The bartender looks as though he knows
Everybody's, everybody's made it home
Here we sit again all alone, mmm, hm

I've got to get up at 8
Don't you know I've got to explain why I'm so late, mmm…
I wish I didn't have to go home
Whoa…oh…whoa…oh…oh…go home

I wish that you were mine, baby
Oh, I'd give you the world
And every little thing your heart desires
