 How'd this shit happen?
 Let me tell you BRC


It happened cause I happened to meet up with Billy Cyrus
It happened cause I rang the alarm, and broke the silence
It happened cause I'm sippin' on that good Kentucky whiskey
It happened cause I'd rather be lucky, than good


Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man


Baby, don't you say a thing, do just what you do
Got me stuck on you like liquor, I swear you're hundred proof
And if I forget to mention, you got my attention
The only thing I'm askin' you to do




I've been next to BRC, up on TMZ
Got everybody wonderin' who I am
Miley keeps twerkin', daddy's song is workin'
Now Billy sing that crazy hook again
