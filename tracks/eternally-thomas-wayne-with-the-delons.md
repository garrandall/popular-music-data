With The DeLons

Love
They say
Is a river
Of tears
That carries
Your dreams
Away

When
I dream
I take her
With me
On a trip
Down that river
To the sea

Where
I find
For all time
Eternal love
A love that's mine
So go on
Flow on
River
To the sea
Go on
My love
Go on
My love
Go on
Eternally (eternally)
