All my life I've wondered, lots of money I have squandered
I said they'll never be a woman, who can tie me down
But lying here this evening, and listening to your breathing
I know that I was dreaming cause look what I've found

Oh Marlena, I'm so glad that I found you
My is world turning around you, girl your one of a kind
Oh Marlena, you're the sun in my mornin'
Girl I'm giving you warning, soon your gonna be mine

I used to love and leave em
I would cheat and I'd deceive em
I had each one believing, I would never go
Nobody could have told me that such a little girl could hold me
But you could shape and mold me 'cause I love you so

Oh Marlena, I'm so glad that I found you
My is world turning around you, girl your one of a kind
Oh Marlena, you're the sun in my mornin'
Girl I'm giving you warning, soon your gonna be mine

My roaming days are over looks like I found my four leaf clover
Girl you've clipped my wings so I can't fly away
And now we're here together and girl it's gonna get better
Cause by your side is where I'm gonna stay

Oh Marlena, I'm so glad that I found you
My is world turning around you, girl your one of a kind
Oh Marlena, you're the sun in my mornin'
Girl I'm giving you warning, soon your gonna be mine

Oh Marlena, I'm so glad that I found you
My is world turning around you, girl your one of a kind
Oh Marlena...
