There will never be any peace
Until God is at the conference table
There will never be any peace
Until God is seated at the conference table
(He's at the conference table)

Men are runnin' from land to land
Tryin' to make things all right
Holding meeting after meeting, constantly reaching
For what they maybe thinking is right

Everybody has a plan
Ain't that just a man
People can't you understand?
We gotta tell 'em

There will never be any peace
Until God is seated at the conference table
(He's at the conference table)

There will never be any peace
Until God is seated at the conference table
(He's at the conference table)

What went on in the dark
Has come to light
Tell me who's to blame
And what's his name?

You can point your finger
But you gotta remember
What was done was done by a man
So we gotta tell 'em

There will never be any peace
Until God is seated at the conference table
(He's at the conference table)

There will never be any peace
Until God is seated at the conference table
(He's at the conference table)

There will never be any peace
Until God is seated at the conference table
(He's at the conference table)

There will never be any peace
Until God is seated at the conference table
(He's at the conference table)

Oh yeah, until God is seated
(There will never be any peace, until God)
At the conference table
(He's at the conference table)

God only needs
(There will never be any peace)
God seeing it 
(Until God)
Every body sing together
(He's at the conference table)

There will never be any peace
No, no, peace
(Until God)
Until he is seated at the conference table
(He's at the conference table)

There will never be any peace
So sing a little prayer now
(Until God, He's at the conference table)
Everybody
(There will never be any peace until God
He's at the conference table)

Holding hand in hand
(There will never be any peace)
All over the land
(Until God)
He's at the conference table
