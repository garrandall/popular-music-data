The times are tough now, just getting tougher
This old world is rough, it's just getting rougher
Cover me, come on baby, cover me


Well I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me


Promise me baby you won't let them find us
Hold me in your arms, let's let our love blind us
Cover me, shut the door and cover me


Well I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me


Outside's the rain, the driving snow
I can hear the wild wind blowing
Turn out the light, bolt the door
I ain't going out there no more


This whole world is out there just trying to score
I've seen enough; I don't want to see any more
Cover me, come on and cover me


Well I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me


Outside's the rain, the driving snow
I can hear the wild wind blowing
Turn out the light, bolt the door
I ain't going out there no more


Well I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me
Well I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me
Well I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me


Come on baby
Come on baby
Come on baby
