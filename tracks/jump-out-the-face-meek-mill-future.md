I just took a perc now I'm on another level
Tasting on the molly got me dancing with the devil
Poured a 8th of Kobe Bryant mixing purple with the yellow
Got these racks on demand its hard to keep this shit together


Jump out the Rari then jump out the Wraith
Then I hop in Margiela then hop in some Bape
Then jump out the face, then jump out the face
Money gon' stack and this money gon' fall
(Meek Mill)


Came from the hood now we jump out of states
Peep all these diamonds they jump out the face
Ducking indictments and selling this white
Got to watch for these niggas they'll jump on your case
(Watch all these niggas, these niggas be playing)
And none of this money don't come out the safe
Fuck with my dawg knock a chunk out ya face
Nigga I be so high I could jump out to space
What the fuck did I say?


I be so fly, I just done shoot down my cape
Went and bought me a safe and it came with a Wraith
Got some new money went and bought me a K
You see all them VV's jump out the face
Put that dope in the trap and cook up me a cake
We fly to Cuba to fuck up some mula
Pour up some pour up my nigga we boolin'
Young nigga pull up in Bentleys, I'm boolin'
I'm taking your ho from you cause she was choosy
I keep them shooters on deck I approve it
Get me a truck of them things I'll move it
VVS cuts on my wrist suicidal
I stay lit up with that flawless on fire
I spend it all with my niggas let's get it
Get out your feelings young nigga let's get it
I got stars on my ceiling


Jump out the Rari then jump out the Wraith
Then I hop in Margiela then hop in some Bape
Then jump out the face, then jump out the face
Money gon' stack and this money gon' fall


I've been peeping you niggas been watching my moves
Watching my stacks and my shoes
When everybody did the Gucci and Louis
We was on Jimmy Choos
2012 when we did the Giuseppes,Margielas was cool
When you lil niggas was worried about Jordans
We was rocking them Loubs
If I got to lose it's not by the rules
Get hit with that chopper knock right out your shoes
Shawty so proper she look like a goddess
When I dip inside her them jet like a pool
I bought some Rarris and I bought some Phantoms
And then dropped the ceilings like I dropped out of school
Still will pull up on you hop out with goons
Thirty-two shots let it pop out the tool


I just took a perc now I'm on another level
Tasting on the molly got me dancing with the devil
Poured 8th of Kobe Bryant mixing purple with the yellow
Got these racks on demand hard to keep this shit together


Jump out the Rari then jump out the Wraith
Then I hop in Margiela then hop in some Bape
Then jump out the face, then jump out the face
Money gon' stack and this money gon' fall
