Hello Mrs. Johnson you self-righteous woman
Sunday School teacher what brings you out slumming
Do you reckon the preacher would approve where you are
Standing here visiting with a back-sliding Christian
In a neighborhood bar

Well yes that's my bottle and yes that's my glass
And I see you're eye balling this pretty young lass
It ain't none of your business but yes she's with me
And we don't need no sermon you self-righteous woman
Just let us be

The Lord knows I'm drinking and running around
And He don't need your loud mouth informing the town
The Lord knows I'm sinning and sinning ain't right
But me and the Good Lord's gonna have us a good talk
Later tonight

Goodbye Mrs. Johnson you self-righteous biddy
I don't need your preaching and I don't need your pity
So go back to whatever you hypocrites do
And when I talk to Heaven be nice and I'll put in
A good word for you
