They can't touch me
We break off
Run so fast they can't even touch me
Been that gypsy
Touch me I'll show you tricks with my zig-zag quickly
Pick up that pack on my journey
Dogs run, they start to follow me
Have my luck, some days they suck
When we live for the buck
We get for the family

One day I wanna be a star
So I get to hang in a bar
I'd go to Vegas, see the Payards
Just to forget my scars

एक दो तीन चार पांच छ सात आठ नौ दस ग्यारह बारह तेरह

Sweat shops have made me shifty
Like a ninja with speed I'm nifty
I hope I live 'til I'm fifty
See my city go from gritty to pretty

Dogs start to follow me
To hang in a bar
Wanna be a star
Pick up that packs on my journey
A starved economy
I wanna be a star

Pick up that packs on my journey
Start to follow me
एक दो तीन चार पांच छ सात आठ नौ दस ग्यारह बारह तेरह
