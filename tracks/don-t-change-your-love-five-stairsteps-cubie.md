With Cubie
Baby, this year, I've been born again
But don't change your love, don't change
'Cause you're gonna get me broke
Baby don't change your love
Don't change it
I'm in love
And if it's all the same, don't change
Baby, don't change
Come on now, I love you, you know it
Don't change your ways
In two
If I'm losing you
So don't change your love
Don't change
Might be a little lazy
But I'm goin' crazy
Baby don't change your love, don't change
I'm in love
And if it's all the same, don't change
Baby, don't change
Come on now, I love you

You know it too
So don't change your ways

In two
If I'm losin' you
So don't change your love
Don't change
I might be a little lazy
You're goin' crazy
Don't change your love
Don't change
Now I'm in love
And if it's all the same, don't change
Baby, don't change
Here we go
Now, I love you
You know it too
So don't change your ways
Now I love you
And you know it too
Baby don't change your way
Jump back
I love you, you know it too
