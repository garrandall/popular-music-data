Graduation Graduation

It's a time for joy
A time for tears
A time we'll treasure through the years
We'll remember always
Graduation day

Graduation Graduation
Graduation Graduation

At the senior prom
We danced till three
And then you gave your heart to me
We'll remember always
Graduation day

Though we leave in sorrow
All the joys we've known
We can face tomorrow
Knowing we'll never walk alone
Though The ivy walls
Are far behind
No matter where our paths may wind
We'll remember always
Graduation day

Graduation Graduation
Graduation Graduation
