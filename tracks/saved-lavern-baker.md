I used to smoke, I used to drink
I used to smoke, drink, and dance the hoochie-coo
I used to smoke and drink
Smoke and drink and dance the hoochie-coo
Whoa, yeah
But now I'm standin' on this corner
Prayin' for a-me and you
Ah, hah


That's why I'm saved (saved)
I'm saved (saved)
People let me tell you 'bout a, kingdom come
You know I'm saved (saved)
I'm saved (saved)
I can preach until you're deaf and dumb
I'm in that soul-savin' army
Beatin' on that big a-bass drum
Whoa, yeah


I used to cuss, I used to fuss
I used to cuss, fuss, and boogie all night long
I used to cuss and fuss
Cuss and fuss and boogie all night long
Wah, hah
But now I'm standin' on this corner
Ah, I know right-a from wrong
Uh, huh


That's why I'm saved (saved)
I'm saved (saved)
People let me tell you 'bout a, kingdom come
You know I'm saved (saved)
I'm saved (saved)
I can preach until you're deaf and dumb
I'm in that soul-savin' army
Beatin' on that big a-bass drum
Whoa, yeah


I used to lie, I used to cheat
I used to lie, cheat, and step on peoples' feet
I used to lie and cheat
Lie and cheat and step on peoples feet
Oh, yeah
But now I'm steppin' on the glory
Salvation is my beat
Whoa, yeah


That's why I'm saved (saved)
I'm saved (saved)
People let me tell you 'bout a, kingdom come
You know I'm saved (saved)
I'm saved (saved)
I can preach until you're deaf and dumb
I'm in that soul-savin' army
Beatin' on that big a-bass drum
Whoa, yeah
