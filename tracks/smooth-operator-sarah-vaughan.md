Cha, cha, cha, cha

You're a smooth operator
(Uh huh)
You're a cool sweet potato
(Oh yeah)

Kiss me, baby
Don't make me wait
Hug me, honey
Don't you hesitate

Take my heart and
Don't give it back
(Cha, cha, cha, cha)
I like it like that

You're a smooth operator
(Uh huh)
You're a gone alligator
(Oh yeah)

Ooh, tell me, baby
Whatcha gonna do?
You got me sighing
Wishing for you

But I'm here to tell you
One natural fact
(Cha, cha, cha, cha)
I like it like that

You've got me yearning
Burning with desire
You set my heart
And soul on fire

You drive me wild
You make me shout
Have mercy, Mr. Percy
Now cut that out

You're a smooth operator
(Uh huh)
Woo, you're the end of
Butter greater
(Oh yeah)

When you kiss me, baby
My toenails curl
And I'm so glad
Just to be your girl

I'd be happy
In a one room shack
(Cha, cha, cha, cha)
Mmm, I like it like that
I like it like that

Cha, cha, cha, cha

I like it, I like it
I like it
