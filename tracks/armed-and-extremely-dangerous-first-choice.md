Calling all cars... calling all cars
Be on the lookout for Dangerous Dan...
This man is wanted by the F.B.I. - 10-4

Said he's dangerous, armed and extremely dangerous

The day he walked into my life he caught me with my guard down
Don't let him talk his sweet talk on ya
'Cause I've hit on the bait that he threw and I got hooked,
Don't let it happen to you

Said he's dangerous, armed and extremely dangerous
Said he's dangerous, armed and extremely dangerous

The day I came into his charms who would think that he would succeed

Then go on his way leaving me here with another mouth to feed
So girls if you see him, you might think that you need him
He might look like the average guy, but he's wanted by the F.B.I.

Said he's dangerous, armed and extremely dangerous
Said he's dangerous, armed and extremely dangerous

Said he's dangerous
Oh, hell do it - bleed the life from me
Said he's dangerous
He don't care for nobody but his self

Said he's dangerous, armed and extremely dangerous
Said he's dangerous, armed and extremely dangerous

Look out girls, he might be
Walkin' the streets right now
Said he's dangerous, extremely dangerous
