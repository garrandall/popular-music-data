There's a guy I want you to know
He's the guy I love so
He's my Teddy, oh Teddy
I I love you so

Oh I remember the day that we met
I'd be so silly to ever forget
Oh Teddy, Aw Teddy
I I love him so

He is so shy, it doesn't matter
You're my guy can't you see

That I want you, I need you
I love you I do
And you belong to me

I'll always love you
The rest of my life
We could get married
I'd be your wife
Wo-o-o Teddy, aw Teddy
I, I love you so

I'll always love you
The rest of my life
We could get married
I'd be your wife
Wo-o-o Teddy, aw Teddy
I, I love you so
