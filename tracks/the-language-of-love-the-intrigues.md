The language of love
Shoo-be-doo-be-boo
The language of love
Sha-la-la-la-la

When you dig a girl you meet
To sweep her off her feet
Tell her
Oh-la-la-la-la
Oh-la-la-la-la

If it's true love at first sight
And everything is right
Tell her
La-di-da-di-da
La-di-da-di-da

It may sound foreign to her ears
But in her heart she understands and hears
The language of love
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo
The language of love
Sha-la-la-la-la

When you want to steal a kiss
But she tries to resist
Tell her
Scooby-doobie-doo
Scooby-doobie-doo
When you reach to hold her tight
But she jumps out of sight
Tell her
La-di-da-di-da
La-di-da-di-da

It may sound foreign to her ears
But in her heart she'll understand and hear
The language of love
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo
The language of love
Sha-la-la-la-la
The language of love
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo
The language of love
Sha-la-la-la-la

Sha-la-la-scooby-doo
