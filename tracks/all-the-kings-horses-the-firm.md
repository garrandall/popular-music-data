It's an age-old score that's got to be settled
It's an age-old debt that's got o be paid
hen the King breaks through in all of His glory
To claim His throne on the world that He made

The nations wait with their armies gathered
With Jerusalem firmly under their thumbs
There will be no peace in Armageddon Valley
'Til the trumpet sounds and the cavalry comes

When He arrives, He will conqure them all
Take back the ground given after the fall

All the King's horses and all the King's men
Gonna ride down from heaven from where they've been
All the King's horses and all the King's men
Gonna put this world back together again
Gonna put this world back together...

On a great white horse, the King will come ridin'
He's the One they call Faithful and True
With His eyes of fire and blood-dripped clothing
He had a name nobody else knew

And by His side ride the armies of heaven
Dressed in linens clean and white as the snow
Riding down to earth with a vengance so holy
For the one-day battle that will crumple their foe

And when the dust and the smoke disappears
The King will reign for a thousand years



All the King's horses and all the King's men
Gonna put this world back together again
Gonna put this world back together again

When the lion lays down with the lamb
There'll be peace in the Land of Abraham
They will beat their swords into plows
When ever tongue will confess, and every knee bows
