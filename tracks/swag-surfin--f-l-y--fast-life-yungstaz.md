Man I got that swag
My hat matching my bag
You know I'm poppin' tags
Cuz man I got that swag

Man I got that swag
My hat matching my bag
You know I'm poppin' tags
Cuz man I got that swag
(I swag when I surf, now watch me surf and swag)

I'm on Hypnotic, exotic
This Polo on my body
Got a bad girl beside me
And her friend right behind me
And I'm swaggin', I'm surfin'
I'm swaggin', I'm surfin'
I'm swaggin', I'm surfin'
I'm clean like dish detergent

On Patron, yeah I'm gone
Purple by the zone, yeah I'm smokin' strong
And you know I'm gone
And I'm swaggin', I'm surfin'
I'm swaggin', I'm surfin'
I'm swaggin', I'm surfin'
I'm clean like dish detergent

Okay I pop out in the club with a pocketful of ones
Big stupid fresh like I'm wrapped up in Saran
Swag super cool, blowin' strong like a fan
And my chain shining hard, it just gave my neck a tan
Pockets on Popeye cuz they swoll off dat spinach
Peachtree swag you can call me Mr. Lenox
Bottles in my hand, puttin' on just like cable
Surfin' on the scene like a young Kelly Slater
(I swag when I surf now watch me surf and swag)
I swag when I surf
I swag when I surf
I swag when I surf
Now watch me surf and swag

Swaggin' in the club, you gonna see me throwin' money up
Catch me with a bad chick and all her friends as fine as her
Drinks, we gon' pour them up
Exotic, what we rollin' up
Patron, Goose, or Hennessy
They got it, I'ma drank it up
I'm always wearin' Polo
Nigga, I'm Ralph Lauren mascot
Cake on Debit, I don't hesitate to cash out (I spend it all)
Paint John Stephenson, the black and blue Jag' out
Pockets on half-time, I'm always bringin' bands out

On Patron, yeah I'm gone
Purple by the zone, yeah I'm smokin' strong
And you know I'm gone
And I'm swaggin', I'm surfin'
I'm swaggin', I'm surfin'
I'm swaggin', I'm surfin'
I'm clean like dish detergent
When I hit the club, it's like I gotta catch a wave
Boogie-board shawty, got me surfing off the stage
Purp' got me geeked, smokin' like an Eddie Bauer
And I'm surfin' like I'm Otto cuz I got that Rocket Power
Gon' on Patron, takin' shots like a camera
Flat screen, shawty, man I'm surfin like a channel
Paper towel money, man I'm all about my count
And I'm screaming "Cowabunga" while y'all boys wiping out

Polo on my body wit' a Zach Moore swag
Yea, Purple Label man go and check the tags
Went and got da shoes so you know I got the bag
Clean just like dish detergent with a Tide color swag
Chain swangin' hard like a boxer throwin' punches
Pappadeaux, shawty, all on them sack lunches
I'm in the party surfin' like I'm standin' on a wave
Shawty check my dougie like she Patty Mayonaise
