I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow, snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white


The sun is shining
The grass is green
The orange and palm trees sway
There's never been such a day in old L.A
But it's December the 24th
And I'm longing to be up north
So I can have my very own white Christmas

(sung)
Oh yeah!


I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white, yeah
Be white!
