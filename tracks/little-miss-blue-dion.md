Just a little girl in love, counting every star above
A certain boy has caught her eye
A certain boy has caught the eye
Of Little Miss Blue

Of Little Miss Blue

Oh Little Miss Blue you give away your heart it's true
To someone who'll never care
Someone who never ever care
Oh Little Miss Blue

Oh Little Miss Blue

And I wonder if you always, always, always be blue
Or someday you'll find someone who loves you

Oh Little Miss Blue tell you what I'm gonna do
If you'll give me a chance

If you'll just give me a chance
I'll really love you

Oh Little Miss Blue

Just a little girl in love, she's counting every star above
A certain boy has caught her eye
A certain boy has caught the eye
Of Little Miss Blue

And I wonder if you always, always, always be blue
Or someday you'll find someone who loves you

Oh Little Miss Blue tell you what I'm gonna do
If you'll give me a chance

If you'll just give me a chance
I'll really love you

Oh Little Miss Blue

Mmm Little Miss Blue

Oh Little Miss Blue

I'll want to really love you
Oh Little Miss Blue

I'll really love you
Oh Little Miss Blue
