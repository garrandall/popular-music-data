Waste into the shadows
Chase away the demon
Looking for the answer
Always gonna need one now

I've got to tell you
When you're always running
There's nowhere you can hide
Under the gun
Feel the fear inside you now, yeah

'Cause we are living in a crazy, crazy world
You know, you really got to wonder what's going on
(What's going on?)
We're living in a crazy, crazy world
You know, you only got one time around, yeah

Why should I believe you
When everything you tell me it's not the truth?
You're really trying to sell me now
Just keep on moving

Right along the ledge
Got nowhere left to hide
Don't know where you're headed
Feel the fear inside you now

'Cause we are living in a crazy, crazy world
You know, you really got to wonder what's going on
(What's going on?)
Living in a crazy, crazy world
You know, you only got one time around

Though we're going crazy
We see the light of day anyway
Even though it's hazy
It's never too late
(Never, never)
Don't make me wait

You know we're living in a crazy, crazy world
You know, you really got to wonder what's going on
(What's going on?)
Living in a crazy, crazy world
You know, you only got one time around

Living in a crazy, crazy world
You know, you really got to wonder what's going on
Living in a crazy, crazy world
You know, you only got one time, one time around

We're living in a crazy, crazy world
You know you really got to wonder what's going on
(What's going on?)
Living in a crazy, crazy world
You know, you only got one time, one time around
