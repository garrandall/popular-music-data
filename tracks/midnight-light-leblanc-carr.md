She was lonely
And no one really cared
Just a prisoner
Of a love that was unfair

She really wanted him
But he was never there
Now she's looking for a lover
For the lonely nights to share

In the midnight light
Shining from her window
The loving light
Keeps me glowing inside
The midnight light
Brightens up the shadows

First time lovers
It'll never be the same
I was losing
But still I played the game
She looked right through me
Like no one ever dared
She said meet me at midnight
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm scared

In the midnight light
Shining from her window
The loving light
Keeps me glowing inside
The midnight light
Brightens up the shadows

I feel so sorry when I hold her tight
Cause I know I'm holding a lover for one night

In the midnight light
Shining from her window
The loving light
Keeps me glowing inside
The midnight light
Brightens up the shadows

Keep the light on baby
Keep the light on baby
Know I'm coming to love you
Coming to love you tonight baby
Oh baby
Yeah baby
Whooo baby
