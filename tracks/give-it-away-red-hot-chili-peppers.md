Oh, oh


What I got you got to give it to your mamma
What I got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I got you got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling, don't stop, continue
I realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide with sly you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the Kaiser


Give it 'way, give it 'way, give it 'way now
Give it 'way, give it 'way, give it 'way now
Give it 'way, give it 'way, give it 'way now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper


Greedy little people in a sea of distress
Keep your more to receive your less
Unimpressed by material excess
Love is free, love me, say, "Hell, yes"
Low brow but I rock a little know how
No time for the piggies or the hoosegow
Get smart get down with the pow wow
Never been a better time than right now
Bob Marley poet and a prophet
Bob Marley taught me how to off it
Bob Marley walkin' like he talk it
Goodness me can't you see I'm gonna cough it


Give it 'way, give it 'way, give it 'way now
Give it 'way, give it 'way, give it 'way now
Give it 'way, give it 'way, give it 'way now
Oh, oh yeah
Give it 'way, give it 'way, give it 'way now
Give it 'way, give it 'way, give it 'way now
Give it 'way, give it 'way, give it 'way now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper




Lucky me swimming in my ability
Dancing down on life with agility
Come and drink it up from my fertility
Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility
My mom, I love her 'cause she love me
Long gone are the times when she scrub me
Feelin' good my brother gonna hug me
Drink my juice young love chug-a-lug me
Ah, there's a river born to be a giver
Keep you warm won't let you shiver
His heart is a never gonna wither
Come on, everybody, time to deliver


Give it 'way, give it 'way, give it 'way now
Give it 'way, give it 'way, give it 'way now
Give it 'way, give it 'way, give it 'way now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper


What I got you got to give it to your mamma
What I got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I got you got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling, don't stop, continue
I realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide with sly you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the Kaiser


Give it 'way, give it 'way, give it 'way now
Give it 'way, give it 'way, give it 'way now
Give it 'way, give it 'way, give it 'way now
Give it 'way, give it 'way, give it 'way now


Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Yeah
