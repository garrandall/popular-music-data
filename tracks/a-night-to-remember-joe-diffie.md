Been one tough week, dead on my feet
But, I've made plans for tonight
When I'm feeling blue, know just what to do
And how to make it right
Seems like I've needed this forever
Gonna have myself a night to remember

Dim the lights, lock the door, spread your pictures
On the floor, throw the dust off of our past let it
All come floodin' back, cause' it ain't easy being 
Strong and when I can't forget your gone I just 
Surrender, and have myself a night to remember.

Sad ain't my style but once in a while 
I just have to give in
'Cause a woman like you, is so hard to lose
You just don't want it to end
I know this can't go on forever 
So tonight I'll have a night to remember

Dim the lights, lock the door, spread your pictures
On the floor, throw the dust off of our past let it
All come floodin' back, cause' it ain't easy being 
Strong and when I can't forget your gone I just 
Surrender, and have myself a night to remember.

Oh it ain't easy being strong and when I can't 
Forget your gone I'll just surrender and have
Myself a night to remember
