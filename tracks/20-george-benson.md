When I think of all I put you through
Always taking you for granted
I never saw it from your point of view
Blinded by the double standard

You were tryin' to tell me all along
Something in the love was missing
You said "It's not too late to get it back"
But I just wasn't listening

If I knew back then what I know now
If I understood the what , when , why and how
Now it's clear to me
What I should have done
But hindsight is 20/20 vision

Now I see it in a different light
I've been losin' you in stages
Give us one more chance
I'll get it right
Girl , you're gonna see some changes

If I knew back then what I know now
If I understood the what , when , why and how
Now it's clear to me
What I should have done
But hindsight is 20/20 vision

Takin' time to catch up on some history
Tryin' to figure out what went wrong
with you and me
And it doesn't really matter
what's been before
But I know there's no future
with you walkin' out that door
