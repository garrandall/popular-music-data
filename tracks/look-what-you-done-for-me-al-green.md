Now that you're here with me
I want to keep you free
To do the things that you want to do
The joy in life is loving you
But now the day has come
To let you know where I'm coming from, yeah
The best of my years will go to you
It's the only thing that I can do
But these things don't come overnight
Lovin' you, baby, and I think I'm right
Let me say before I forget
Lovin' you, baby, it's where it's at, yeah


And oh baby, look what you done for me
Oh baby, you set my heart free, yeah
Oh, what a feeling, yeah yeah yeah
What a feeling, yeah


Sometimes I wanna leave, but then I say
It wouldn't make sense, no, anyway
Forgive me baby, if I do wrong
I haven't been a true man for so long
Let be say before I forget
Lovin' you, baby, it's where it's at


Oh baby, look what you done for me
Oh baby, you set my heart free
Baby, do you wanna, do the thing that you oughta
You've been very good for me
And I, I gotta, gotta to say it
Oh baby, look what you done for me
Oh yeah, you set my heart free, yeah


Oh, no matter, what you done for me
I got this feelin' that it's gonna...hey!
And oh, look what you done for me
Baby baby, you set my heart free
