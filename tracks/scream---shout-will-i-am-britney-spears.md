Bring the action

When you hear this in the club
You're gonna turn this shit up
You're gonna turn this shit up
You're gonna turn this shit up
When we up in the club
All eyes on us
All eyes on us
All eyes on us

See the boys in the club
They watching us
They watching us
They watching us

Everybody in the club
All eyes on us
All eyes on us
All eyes on us

I wanna scream and shout, and let it all out
And scream, and shout, and let it out
We saying, "Oh wee oh wee oh wee oh."
We saying, "Oh wee oh wee oh wee oh."

I wanna scream and shout, and let it all out
And scream, and shout, and let it out
We saying, "Oh wee oh wee oh wee oh."

You are now, now rocking with will.i.am and Britney bitch

Bring the action

Rock and roll, everybody let's lose control
On the bottom we let it go
Going fast, we ain't going slow, no, no
Hey! Yo, hear the beat, now let's hit the floor
Drink it up, and then drink some more
Light it up, and let's let it blow, blow, blow

Hey! Yo, rock it out, rockin' now
If you know what we talking 'bout
Turn it up, and burn down the house, ho-house
Hey! Yo, turn it up, and don't turn it down
Here we go, we gon' shake the ground
'Cause everywhere that we go we, bring the action

When you hear this in the club
You're gonna turn this shit up
You're gonna turn this shit up
You're gonna turn this shit up

When we up in the club
All eyes on us
All eyes on us
All eyes on us

You see them girls in the club
They looking at us
They looking at us
They looking at us

Everybody in the club
All eyes on us
All eyes on us
All eyes on us

I wanna scream and shout, and let it all out
And scream, and shout, and let it out
We saying, "Oh wee oh wee oh wee oh."
We saying, "Oh wee oh wee oh wee oh."

I wanna scream and shout, and let it all out
And scream, and shout, and let it out
We saying, "Oh wee oh wee oh wee oh."

You are now, now rocking with will.i.am and Britney bitch

It goes on and on and on and on
When me and you party together
I wish this night would last forever
'Cause I was feeling down, now I'm feeling better

And maybe it goes on and on and on and on
When me and you party together
I wish this night would last forever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever

I wanna scream and shout, and let it all out
And scream, and shout, and let it out
We saying, "Oh wee oh wee oh wee oh."
We saying, "Oh wee oh wee oh wee oh."

I wanna scream and shout, and let it all out
And scream, and shout, and let it out
We saying, "Oh wee oh wee oh wee oh."
We saying, "Oh wee oh wee oh wee oh."

I wanna scream and shout, and let it all out
And scream and shout, and let it out
We saying, "Oh wee oh wee oh wee oh."

You are now, now rocking with will.i.am and Britney bitch
