If I can see this one night through
Maybe I'll get over you
And realize our love was never right

But I may not live to see tomorrow
I may die of a broken heart tonight

If I'm around when daylight breaks
I may find the strength it takes
To love again and make things
Come out right

But I may not live to see tomorrow
I may die of a broken heart tonight

I tell myself tomorrow's
Gonna be a better day
But tomorrow seems to be
A century away

If I survive the morning dew
Maybe I'll find someone new
And start again to build
A brand new life

But I may not live to see tomorrow
I may die of a broken heart tonight

No, I may not live to see tomorrow
I may die of a broken heart tonight
