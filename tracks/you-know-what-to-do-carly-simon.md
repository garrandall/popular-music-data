(Carly Simon/Jacob Brackman)

The night is filled with pretty girls
Dancing shoes and flying hair
Not one of them would refuse
To follow you up the stairs
You could have your pick of them
Why decide to pick on me
You promised me you'd stay away
You promised me you'd set me free
Pounding of my heart
Trembling of my hands
Somethings I'll just never understand

Chorus:
You know what to do to me
You know what it does to me
You know what to do to me
You know what it does to me
You know what to do

The night is filled with shooting stars
I watch them fall 'cause I can't sleep
I pray that you won't call at all
I'm still awake at ten to three
I hear your motorcycle roar
You pull up short outside my door
I don't know how I got outside
I don't know why I'm on this ride

We make love like a house on fire
We make love like dogs gone mad
Somethings I'll just never understand


Pounding out my heart
Trembling of my hands
Somethings I'lll just never understand
