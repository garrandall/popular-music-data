You are all the woman I need, and baby you know it
You can make this beggar a king, a clown or a poet
I'll give you all that I own
You got me standing in line
Out in the cold
Pay me some mind

Bend me, shape me
Any way you want me
Long as you love me, it's all right
Bend me, shape me
Any way you want me
You got the power to turn on the light

Everybody tells me I'm wrong to want you so badly
But there's a force driving me on, I follow it gladly
So let them laugh I don't care
Cause I got nothing to hide
All that I want is you by my side

Bend me, shape me
Any way you want me
Long as you love me, it's all right
Bend me, shape me
Any way you want me
You got the power to turn on the light
Bend me shape me anyway you want me (fade)
