Is everybody safe?
Has everybody got a place to hide?
Is everybody warm inside?

Hear them singing
All the women of Pompeii
Standing with the Kansas City housewives in doorways
In volcanoes and tornadoes on doomsday


De profundis clamavi ad te Domine
Donae nobis pacem
(5x)

There were houses, there were hoses
There were sprinklers on the lawn
There was an ironing board
And she would stand and made her understand him
And ask the children what they'd done at school that day
And the yard went on forever
There were blouses with print roses, checkered shirts and white Levis
There was a frying pan and she would cook their dreams while they were dreaming
And later she would send them out to play
And the yard went on forever


Is everybody safe?
Has everybody got a place to hide?
Is everybody warm inside?

Hear them singing
All the women of Pompeii
Standing with the Nagasaki housewives in doorways
In eruptions and destructions on doomsday


De profundis clamavi ad te Domine
Donae nobis pacem
(x4)
