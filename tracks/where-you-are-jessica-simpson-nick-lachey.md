Yeah...oh yeah.
I can show you the world.
Shining shimmering splendid.
Tell me princess now when did you last let your heart decide.
I can open your eyes.
Take you wonder by wonder.
Over sideways and under on a magic carpet ride.

A whole new world.
A new fantastic point of view.
No one to tell us no or where to go or say we're only dreaming.


A whole new world.
A dazzling place I never knew.
But now from way up here it's crystal clear that now I'm in a whole new world with you.
Unbelievable sights. ( Unbelievable sights.)
Indescribable feeling. Soaring, tumbling, free-wheeling.
Through an endless diamond sky.
A whole new world.

 Don't you dare close your eyes.
 A hundred thousand things to see.
 Hold your breath, it gets better.

 I'm like a shooting star.
I've come so far.

 A whole new world.)
A whole new world.

 With new horizons to pursue.
 I'll chase them anywhere, there's time to spare.
 Let me share this whole new world with you.

 A whole new world)
A new fantastic point of view.

 No one to tell us no or where to go

 A whole new world)
Every turn a surprise.

 Every moment gets better.)

 I'll chase them anywhere, there's time to spare.
 Anywhere.
 Oh there's time to spare.
 Let me share,
 this whole new world with you.

 With You. A whole new world.
 A whole new world.
 That's where we'll be.
 Where we will be.
 A thrilling chase.
 A wonderous place.
 For you and...me.
