I know you see me
Like some wide eyed dreamer
That just rolled in off a dusty mid west bus
Yeah, on the outside I look fragile
But on the inside is something you canât crush

Cause I'm country strong
Hard to break
Like the ground I grew up on
You may fool me
And I'll fall
But I wonât stay down long
Cause Iâm country strong

I have weathered
Colder winters; Longer summers
Without a drop of rain
Push me in a corner
And Iâll come out fighting
I may lose but I âll always keep my faith

Cause Iâm country strong
Hard to break
Like the ground I grew up on
You may fool me
And Iâll fall
But I wonât stay down long
Cause Iâm country strong

Cause Iâm country strong
Hard to break
Like the ground I grew up on
You may fool me
And Iâll fall
But I wonât stay down long
Cause Iâm country strong

Iâm country strong
Yeah, Iâm country strong
Iâm country strong
Iâm country strong
Iâm country strong
