If I could escape I would
But first of all, let me say
I must apologize
For acting stank and treating you this way

'Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold?

If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favourite girl forever
Perfectly together
Now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet?
(sweet escape)
If I could be sweet (be sweet)
I know I've been a real bad girl
(I'll try to change)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt
(whatsoever)
We can make it better,
And tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet?
(sweet escape)


I want to get away
To our sweet escape
I want to get away


You melt me down,
I'm at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out
I need to get me out of this joint
Come on let's bounce
Counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around
Let's look for some common ground

So, baby
Times get a little crazy
I've been gettin' a little lazy
Waitin' on you to come save me
I can see that you're angry
By the way that you treat me
Hopefully you don't leave me
Wanna take you with me

If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favourite girl forever
Perfectly together
And tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet?
(sweet escape)
If I could be sweet (be sweet)
I know I've been a real bad girl
(I'll try to change)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt
(whatsoever)
We can make it better
And tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet?
(sweet escape)

If I could escape
If I could escape

'Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold?

If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favourite girl forever
Perfectly together
And tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet?
(sweet escape)
If I could be sweet (be sweet)
I know I've been a real bad girl
(I'll try to change)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt
(whatsoever)
We can make it better
And tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet?
(sweet escape)

I wanna get away, get away
To our sweet escape
I wanna get away
