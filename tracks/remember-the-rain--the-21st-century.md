We used to play out in the rain
Your mother scolded us
She said that we were bad
(She said that we were bad)
I thought I'd better go on home (stepped it up and)
You watched till I was gone
Ooh, girl, you looked so sad


I picked you up when you fell and cut your knee
I told you not to cry and held you close to me


As I was running through the storm
To get my umbrella
(Think about it / Think)
I stopped in shock when I saw you
With another fellow, oh, wow


Can you remember the rain?
Can you remember the rain?
You left me for somebody else
Now I must face life by myself


You broke so many rules in school
I took the blame for you
I guess I was the fool
You used to sneak me notes in class
I winked my eye and laughed
Those days went by so fast


I've got remarks that torn us all apart
I'm still tryna put back the pieces to my heart


And I'll be crying your name, girl
Until my very last breath
(Think about it / Think)
'Cause my existence without you
Ain't nothing but a little death
Gosh


Can you remember the rain?
Can you remember the rain?


You left me for somebody else
Now I must face life by myself
