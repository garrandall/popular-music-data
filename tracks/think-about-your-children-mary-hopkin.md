Child isn't born with a prejudiced mind
He only learns what he sees
Or what he's taught to do

Think about your children, mother
Help all mankind
Don't let the weight of hate
Weigh the world down

Here we are in this world together
We were meant to live with each other
Tell the child the truth, it's your own son
And everybody know about freedom

(Think about children)
(Think, think)
(Let them love one another)
(Got a long way to go)
(Really gotta get there fast)

It's a shame that ever had to be
But we can't change the past
Think about your children, mother
Save all mankind
Don't let the weight of hate
Weigh the world down

(Think about children)
I can see a good day comin' (Think, think)
More of love and no time for hating (Help them)
There will be no need for debating (Love one another)
And everybody know about freedom

(Think about children)
Here we are in this world together (Think, think)
We were meant to live with each other (Help them)
Tell the child the truth, it's your own son (Love one another)
And everybody know about freedom

(Think about children)
Think, think
Help them love one another
Think about the children
Think, think
Help them love one another

(Think about children)
I can see a good day a-comin' (Think, think)
More of love and no time for hating (Help them)
There will be no need for debating (Love one another)
And everybody know about freedom

(Think about children)
