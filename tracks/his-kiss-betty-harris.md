Get away, run away
Stay away from that man
'Cause he'll only hurt you
If he can

Oh, no, no, his kiss
His kiss is so, so good
Mmm, his kiss always thrills me
Like only his could

You say he's bad
And I guess, I guess I know
I know, I know, I know

(Let him go) I can't (go)
I can't (go) oh
I just love him so

Get away, run away
Stay away from that man
'Cause he'll only hurt you
If he can

His kiss, oh, his kiss
Thrills me so much
Mmm, I just can't explain
What happens when our
When our lips touch

Oh, you say he'll hurt me
You ain't telling me nothing
Nothing I

(Let him go) I can't (go)
I can't (go) oh
I just love him

Get away, run away
(You can't make me)
Stay away from that man
(I won't stay away, no, I won't)
'Cause he'll only hurt you
(I don't believe you) if he can

Get away (you can't make me)
Run away (I just won't run away)
Stay away (I won't stay away)
From that man (and you just can't make me)
'Cause he'll only hurt you if he can
