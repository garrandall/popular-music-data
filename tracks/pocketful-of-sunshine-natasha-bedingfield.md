I got a pocket,
Got a pocketful of sunshine
I've got a love and I know that it's all mine
Oh, oh, oh
Do what you want,
But you're never gonna break me,
Sticks and stones are never gonna shake me
Oh, oh, oh

Take me away (take me away)
A secret place (a secret place)
A sweet escape (a sweet escape)
Take me away (take me away)
Take me away (take me away
To better days (to better days)
Take me away (take me away)
A hiding place (a hiding place)

I got a pocket,
Got a pocketful of sunshine
I've got a love and I know that it's all mine
Oh, oh, oh
Do what you want,
But you're never gonna break me,
Sticks and stones are never gonna shake me
Oh, oh, oh

I got pocket,
Got a pocketful of sunshine
I've got a love and I know that it's all mine
Oh, oh, oh

Wish that you could,
But you ain't gonna own me
Do anything you can to control me
Oh, oh, oh

Take me away (take me away)
A secret place (a secret place)
A sweet escape (a sweet escape)
Take me away (take me away)
Take me away (take me away
To better days (to better days)
Take me away (take me away)
A hiding place (a hiding place)

There's a place that I go
That nobody knows
Where the rivers flow
And I call it home
And there's no more lies
And the darkness is light
And nobody cries
There's only butterflies

Take me away (take me away)
A secret place (a secret place)
A sweet escape (a sweet escape)
Take me away (take me away)
Take me away (take me away
To better days (to better days)
Take me away (take me away)
A hiding place (a hiding place)


I got a pocket,
Got a pocketful of sunshine
I've got a love and I know that it's all mine
Oh, oh, oh


The sun is on my side
Take me for a ride
I smile up to the sky
I know I'll be alright
