'Cause now it's Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry, Judy's turn to cry
'Cause Johnny's come back to me


Oh, when Judy left with Johnny at my party (My party)
And came back wearing his ring
I sat down and cried my eyes out
Now that was a foolish thing


'Cause now it's Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry, Judy's turn to cry
'Cause Johnny's come back to me


Well, it hurt me so to see them dance together (Together)
I felt like making a scene
Then my tears just fell like rain drops
'Cause Judy's smile was so mean


But now it's Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry, Judy's turn to cry
'Cause Johnny's come back to me


Oh, one night I saw them kissing at a party (A party)
So I kissed some other guy
Johnny jumped up and he hit him
'Cause he still loves me, that's why


So now it's Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry, Judy's turn to cry
'Cause Johnny's come back to me


Yay, now it's Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry, Judy's turn to cry
'Cause Johnny's come back to me
