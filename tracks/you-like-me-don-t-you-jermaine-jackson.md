I remember when we met
Your eyes I can't forget
They told me a lot about you
From the look upon your face
This feeling I could trace
Girl ???? needed love
That smile you gave from my hello
Would light up my world all aglow
I just kept my cool

When you put your hand in mine
I knew that it was time
To let you know how I feel
When you kissed me by surprise
I got buterflies
Swiming around in my soul out of control
The kiss was so warm and so pure
Let's me know what I feel is for sure
One thing that's true
I noticed you like me
Don't you, Don't you

Girl you gave me many signs
I knew it all the time
When you first looked at me baby
You like me don't you
Girl you like me don't you
Oh I know what I feel is real
Girl I wasn't sure what to say to you
If I'm wrong I'm going to say it anyways
One thing that's true
I noticed you like me
Don't you

My mind didn't play tricks on me
I'm sure as sure can be
What I saw in your eyes was for real
That smile you gave from my hello
Would light up my world all aglow
One thing that's true
I noticed you like me
Don't you

One thing that's true
I noticed you like me

Don't you

I knew it all the time

One thing that's true
I noticed you like me
And I like you
