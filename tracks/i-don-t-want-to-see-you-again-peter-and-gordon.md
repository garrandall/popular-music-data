I don't wanna see you again

I hear that love is planned
How can I understand
When someone says to me
"I don't wanna see you again"?

Why do I cry at night?
Something wrong could be right
I hear you say to me
"I don't wanna see you again"

As you turned your back on me
You hid the light of day
I didn't have to play
At bein' broken hearted

I know that later on
After love's been and gone
I'll still hear someone say
"I don't wanna see you again"

As you turned your back on me
You hid the light of day
I didn't have to play
At bein' broken hearted

I hear that love is planned
How can I understand
When someone says to me
"I don't wanna see you again"?

I don't wanna see you again
I don't wanna see you again
