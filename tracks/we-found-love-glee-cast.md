Rachel:
Yellow diamonds in light
Now we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive
It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

New Directions:
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Santana:
Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

Rachel:
It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny (I just can't deny)
But I've gotta let it go

New Directions:
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Rachel (Santana):
Yellow diamonds in the light (In the light)
And we're standing side by side (Ohh)
As your shadow crosses mine (Crosses mine)

New Directions:
We found love in a hopeless place (We found love, oh)
We found love in a hopeless place (Hopeless place)
We found love in a hopeless place (Oh, oh)
We found love in a hopeless place (Hopeless place)

We found love in a hopeless place (We found love)
We found love in a hopeless place (Ohhh)
We found love in a hopeless place (We found love)
We found love in a hopeless place (Hopeless place)
