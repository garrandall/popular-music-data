Thought it was love for the first time
Did not know what I had in store
Big hips, big legs, big feet
But I could not see
Just what she hid behind her door


And my heart stops
And my blood pressure dropped
Oh what a shock he's my girl
I'm a good man
So when she had my hand
That's when I knew that he's my girl

I could be fooled by first impressions
It's true when they say love is blind
Behind the pearls, the hair, and long fingernails
Little did I know what I would find


He's my girl

Oh baby what'd you do to me
You got me going
You got me on your knees
Oh baby tell me please
Is he a she? Is she a he?
I guess it doesn't matter to me
'Cause he's my girl

Look what my best friend did to help me
To win a prize and get us fame
Put on a dress to make them think he's my girl
But he's all man, it's just a game



It might be too late
But by some strange twist of fate
Here is my date
You know he is my girl
That was one kiss
That I'm glad I missed
It's hard to resist you know he's my girl

And my heart stops
And my blood pressure dropped
Oh what a shock you know he's my girl
I'm a good man
