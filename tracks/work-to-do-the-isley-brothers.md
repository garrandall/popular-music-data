I'm taking care of business, woman can't you see
Got to make it for you, got to make it for me
Sometimes it might seem that I've neglected you
But I would love to spend more time
I've got so many things to do

Oh I, got work to do, I've got work, baby
Got work to do, I've got to give it
Got work to do, I've got work to do
Got work to do, got so much work, yeah yeah
I've been trying to make it, woman can't you see
Takes a lot of money to make it, let's talk truthfully
Keep your love light burning, and a little food hot in a plate
You might as well get use to me coming home a little late

'Cause I got work to do, I got work, baby

Got work to do, I've got to give
Got work to do, I got to work
Got work to do, got so much work, yeah yeah
Work, work, yeah, work, work
Work, work, yeah, work, work
I'm taking care of business, woman can't you see
I got to make it for you, got to make it for me
But sometimes it might seem that I've neglected you
But I'd love to spend more time, I got so many things to do

'Cause I got work to do, I got work, baby
Got work to do, I've got to give
Got work to do, I got to work
Got work to do, got so much work, yeah yeah
