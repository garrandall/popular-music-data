I'm taking care of business, woman, can't you see?
I gotta make it for you, and I've gotta make it for me
Oh, sometimes it may seem, girl, I'm neglecting you
Well, I'd love to spend more time --
But I got so many things to do


Oh, I - I got work to do (I got work to do)
I got work, baby! (I got work to do)
I got a job, baby! (I got work to do)
I got work to do! (I got work to do)
Said, I got work to do! (I got work to do)


Well, I'm out here trying to make it, woman, can't you see?
Oh, it takes a lot of money to make, let's talk truthfully
So keep your love lights burning
And a little food hot in my plate
You might as well get used to
Me coming home a little late


Oh, I - I got work to do
I got a job, baby! (I got work to do)
I got work to do (I got work to do)
I got work to do (I got work to do)
I got work to do (I got work to do)
Whaaaaa Ha Ha!

Da-Do Do-Do Do-Do
Da-Do Do-Do Doo-Da-Do Da-Do-Da-Do Da-Do Doo-Doo
Da-Do Do-Do Do-Do
Da-Do Do-Do Doo-Da-Do Da-Do-Da-Do Da-Do Doo-Doo
Da-Do Do-Do Do-Do
Da-Do Do-Do Doo-Da-Do Da-Do-Da-Do Da-Do Doo-Doo


I'm taking care of business, woman, can't you see?
I gotta make it for you, gotta make it for me!
Don't wanna make you feel I'm neglecting you
I'd love to spend more time
Oh, but I got so many things to do!


Whoa, I - I got work to do
I got work, baby! (I got work to do)
Said, I got a job, baby! (I got work to do)
Well, I got work to do! (I got work to do)
Everybody's got work to do! (I got work to do)
Whoooo Hooo Hooo!


Oh, so much work, baby!
Oh, I got work!
Oh, so much work, baby!
Whaaaah Haaa Haaa!
Oh, I got work to do!
I got work!
Oh, I got work, baby!
