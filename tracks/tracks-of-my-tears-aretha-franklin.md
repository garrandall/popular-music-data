People say I'm the life of the party
Because I tell a joke or two
Well, although I may be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue

So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile seems out of place
And if you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears, I need you, need you

Since you left, if you see me with someone else
Acting like I'm having big fun
Well, although he may look fine
He's not a really man, you're the only one

So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile seems out of place
And if you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears, I need you, need you

I'm masquerading, my hope is fading
Since you put me down
My smile is my make up
I wear since my break up with you

Baby, take just one good look at my face
You'll see that my smile seems out of place
And if you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

Oh baby, take just one good look at my face
You'll see that my smile is out of place
And if you look closer, easy to trace
The tracks of my tears, oh

Oh, look at my face
You'll see that my smile seems out of place
And if you look closer
