I've dealt with my ghosts and I've faced all my demons
Finally content with a past I regret
I've found you find strength in your moments of weakness
For once, I'm at peace with myself
I've been burdened with blame
Trapped in the past for too long


I'm movin' on


I've lived in this place and I know all the faces
Each one is different, but they're always the same
They mean me no harm, but it's time that I face it
They'll never allow me to change
But I never dreamed home would end up where I don't belong


I'm movin' on


I'm movin' on
At last I can see (At last I can see)
Life has been patiently Waiting for me
And I know
There's no guarantees, but I'm not alone
There comes a time in everyone's life
When all you can see are the years passing by (All the years passing by)
And I have made up my mind that those days are gone


I sold what I could
And packed what I couldn't
Stopped to fill up on my way out of town
I've loved like I should, but lived like I shouldn't
I had to lose everything to find out
Maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down this road


I'm movin' on
I'm movin' on
I'm movin' on
