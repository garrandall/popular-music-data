Now it begins
Now that you're gone
Needles and pins
Twilight til dawn
Watching that clock
Til you return
Hiding that torch
And watching it burn.

Now it begins
Day after day
This is my life
Ticking away
Waiting to hear
Footsteps that say
Love will appear
And this time to stay.

Oh each time you go
I try to pretend
It's over at last
This time the big hurt will end.

Now it begins
Now that you're gone
Needles and pins
Twilight til dawn
But if you don't
Come back again
I wonder when
Oh when will it end
The big hurt.
