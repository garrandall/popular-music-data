Shawty crunk on the floor wide open
Skeet so much they call her Billy Ocean
Roll like an eighteen wheeler
That hoe fine but this hoe killer
She leakin, she's soakin' wet
She leakin, soakin' wet
Shake it like a salt shaker (shake it like a salt shaker)
Shake it like a salt shaker (shake it like a salt shaker)


Pussy poppin, till you percolate
First booty on duty no time to wait
Make it work, with your wet t-shirt
Bitch you gotta shake it till ya calf muscles hurt
Say the heals on your feet or the strap around your ankle
Call that bitch bojangles
Juicy like fruit or dosh like coup Deville
Used to get loose on the goose for real


Five dollars get your ass a table dance
If you got ten then bring a friend
Hoe shake your ass to the song then
If you ain't with it then well gone then
We ain't no boys we grown men
If you ain't gone dance then don't then
Why you wanna waste a niggas song
then see your ass down doin nothin




Face the wall shawty, put your hands on it
Bounce that ass up and down make a nigga want it
Face the wall shawty, put your hands on it
Bounce that ass up and down make a nigga want it
Roll that ass round and round like a motherfuckin' wheel
Shake that shit this ain't no motherfuckin' drill
Roll that ass round and round like a motherfuckin' wheel
Shake that shit this ain't no motherfuckin' drill
Get crunk with it, get loose with it
Like short said let bruce bruce hit it
Get crunk with it, get loose with it
Like short said let bruce bruce hit it
Shake that ass real fast then stop (aaww shit!)
Shake that ass real fast then stop (aaww shit!)
Shake that ass real fast then drop (aaww shit!)
Shake that ass real fast then drop (aaww shit!)

Shake it like a dollar five or ten
But what would you do for 2a twenty twen
Get on the stage shake that ass then
Get on the pole do a back bend
I like that do it again
Here's another ten bitch do it again
Work like a game that you playin' to win
Make that pussy fart for the Ying Yang Twins
Sixteen bitches in thongs in one club
The home of the fifth red bones and big butts
has been bitches splittin' all over the floor
Hornafy can't deny certified pro
On the poll upside down, (this shit for real)
Sixty-nine plenty time will pay a bill
At day she a clerk but night she turn (stripper)
You're not even dated your just tryin to (tip her)
