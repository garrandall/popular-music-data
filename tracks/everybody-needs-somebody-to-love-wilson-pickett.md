Everybody needs somebody 
Everybody needs somebody to love 
Someone to love, sugar, to kiss, sweetheart, to miss 
And I need (you you you) and I need (you you you) 
In the mornin', baby (you you you) 
When the sun goes down and nobody else around 
Ah sometimes I'm filled, filled with sadness 
My baby mistreat me, I never never have a-mine 
I need (you you you), someone to see me through 
To hold my hand, try to make me understand

I need you, don't you know I need you? 
I need you in the mornin', I need you 

Don't you know I need you 
Let me hear you say yeah! 
Let me hear you say yeah! 
(I need you)
