Baby, Who That Is?


Don't Worry About Who That Is It Ain't You


You Got Somebody Else Over There?


Don't Worry About It Keith If You Was Over Here Taking Care Of Business You Wouldn't Have To
Ask Me No Questions Like That


Oh Girl Please!


Oh Girl Please My Ass! Who That Is Over There?


Are You Mocking Me?


Uh, Boy Ain't Nobody Got To Mock You


Yeah You Mocking Me! You Get Your Little Record Deal And Shit And Think You All That


Oh Bye Keith


Nivea Hello!


You's A Lying Cheating Son Of A
The Way You Do Me Boy I'm Tired Of Taking Your Shit
See I Know All About Those Fast Hoes Up In College Shorty Need To Stop It Hello


Yeah, Baby Why You Trippin' On Shit You Don't Know About
Believin' Every Goddamn Thing That You Hear About


But It's Nothin' That I Heard


Wait A Minute Just Hear Me Out
You Don't Even Know About My Doings And Where Abouts


See Your Wrong There I Busted You Coming Out Some Girl's House


And What's That 'Posed To Mean


Nothin' 'Til You Kissed Her In Her Mouth
Boy Let's Stop Wasting Time
It's Pretty Clear That You's A Lie
Tired Of Sitting Around Hearing All Your Phony Alibis


Soap, Powder, Bleach, Towels, Fabric Softner, Dollars, Change, Pants, Socks, Dirty Drawers
I'm Headed To The Laundromat
And Let's Not Forget The Food Stains, Dirt Spots, Head Sets, Chips, Pop, Pay Phones, Clean House
I'm Headed To The Laundromat


Baby What You Saying


Baby Read Between The Lines
Do I Have To Spell It Out To You I'm Saying Goodbye


Oh Girl Quit Playing I'm The Only Thing You Got


You're The Only Thing I Got
Well Then I Must Not Have A Lot


Girl You Can't Be Serious In Fact I Think You're Gaming


Look Just Call My Manager And He Will Make The Arrangements


So You Really Gon' Go Through With This


Hell Yes 'Cause I'm Fed Up With This


Girl How You Just Gon' Leave Like This


Because You Weren't True To This


Soap, Powder, Bleach, Towels, Fabric Softner, Dollars, Change, Pants, Socks, Dirty Drawers
I'm Going To The Laundromat
And Let's Not Forget The Food Stains, Dirt Spots, Head Sets, Chips, Pop, Pay Phones, Clean House
I'm Headed To The Laundromat


Baby Can We Talk About It?


What Is There To Talk About?
You Don' Hurt Me Time Again Brought Me Up And Break Me Down


Baby Girl I'm Sorry!


Well Sorry's Not Gon' Doing It
I'm For Real This Time Boy I'm Through


Girl I'm 'Bout To Lose It


No Wait Now I Suggest You Don't Go Tryin' Nothin' Stupid


OhBaby I Just Don't Know What I Would Do If I Was To Lose You
Hello Are You There?


Goodbye!


Soap, Powder, Bleach, Towels, Fabric Softner, Dollars, Change, Pants, Socks, Dirty Drawers
I'm Headed To The Laundromat
And Let's Not Forget The Food Stains, Dirt Spots, Head Sets, Chips, Pop, Pay Phones, Clean House
I'm Headed To The Laundromat


I Can't Take It No More
Oh It's Time To Hit Door
Pants And Socks Dirty Towels
Oh I Been Putting Up With Your Shit For A While Now
No More Cryin'
None Of Your Lyin'
You Got To Go Boy
I'm Cleanin' My House Now
Oh, I'm Headed To The Laundromat
