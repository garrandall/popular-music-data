Oh, it's over, it's all over
Said it's over, it's all over, baby
I gotta get away from you as fast as I can
You're too much for me, woman
More than my heart can stand
Like a kid behind the wheel
You've been reckless with my heart
If I stayed around
You'd surely tear it all apart

The road has got to end somewhere
Woman, woman, every road has got to end somewhere
Now is the time for the showdown
So let me give you the lowdown
We've come to the end of our road

Woman, I'm just thinkin' 'bout all the times you promised to call
and I sat at home lonely
You only did it 'cause you knew I love you only
Runnin', runnin' around with every guy in town
I'm tellin' you, woman, no longer will I be your clown

The road has got to end somewhere
Every road has got to end somewhere
I'm tired of your stuff
Say enough is enough
We've come to the end of our road
I can't take it no more

Woman, there's no sense in you beggin' and pleadin'
To hold on when I'm the one you're leavin'
Say I've 'bout had my fill of you (had my fill of you)
Flirtin's all through the years
And I've almost run out of tears
I'm tellin' you, I couldn't cry if I wanted to

The road has got to end somewhere
Every road has got to end somewhere
Time and again I've begged you to slow down
So I'm givin' you the lowdown
We've come to the end of our road, road, road


(Oh, this is the end, the end of our road)
