Love is not the thrill
Of the first connection
Love is not the shiver
In the first embrace
Love is never lost
In the first rejection

If you're thinking
Love comes easy
It's going to disappear
Without a trace

Because what love is?
Is that spark that survives
What love is?
It's worth keeping alive

All this fire while rain
Is pouring in from every side
What love is?
Is admitting we're blind

What love is
When we're trying to find
What love is?

Now I know you've been captured
By a vague suspicion
But, baby, you know
That you heard it from a jealous liar

Can we start improving
On our heart's condition?
Can we stop wasting
All this precious fire? Yeah

Because what love is?
Is that spark that survives
What love is?
It's worth keeping alive

All this fire while rain
Is pouring in from every side
What love is?
Is admitting we're blind

What love is
When we're trying to find
What love is?

Is it the fear of living all alone?
Year after year
I just don't know
But I know I want you here beside me

Is it the need to fill empty place?
Where does it lead, I got to know

'Cause only together
Could we ever hope to see

What love is?
It's the pulse in our veins
What love is?
The pleasures and pain

It survives while rain
Is pouring in from every side

What love is?
Not who's wrong or who's right
What love is?
Waiting for us tonight
What love is?

You have to help me to
Find out just what love is

What love is? What love is?
What love is?
