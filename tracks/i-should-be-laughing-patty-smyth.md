Somewhere in a scrap book
There's a rose you gave to me
And the photograph that's torn in half
And all that's left is me
Live happily ever after
That came after I was gone
And they tell you that you can't go back
Then why can't I go on?

When should be laughin' at this joke
Dressed up as love, diguised as hope
And isn't funny after all this time
A tear is fallin' when I should be laughin'

Sunsets are like a painting, windows like a frame
When night comes in and I begin
To see it all again

'Cause I should be laughing at this joke
The damage done the words I spoke
And isn't funny after all this time
Regret can find me when I should be laughin'
I should laughin' at life
And all of the tricks that it plays
I should be laughing at time
And how fast its slippin' away

Somewhere in a scrap book
There's a rose you gave to me
And with one last look
I close the book
And let the past just be

When should be laughin' at this joke
Dressed up as love, diguised as hope
And isn't funny after all this time
A tear is fallin' when I should be laughin'
