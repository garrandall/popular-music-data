If you believe in magic
You will never, never, never grow old
If you are a dreamer
You will never lose your soul
Once it was a secret
Now the story can be told
Hail, hail
La-la-la-la
Oom-ba-la-da
Ram-a-lama
Dip-ji-dip-di
Yip-yip
Ding-dong

This song goes out for Johnny B. and Betty Lou
And Lucille who's really out of sight
For Rhonda, Dawn and Don and Phil and Peggy Sue
Who fell in love one summer night
Everybody say hail, hail, everybody
Hail, hail rock and roll
Hail, hail rock and roll

We'd be twisting like a piston in our daddy's car
Trying hard to keep it under control
And when we didn't have gas money and we couldn't go far
We'd either walk or we'd do the stroll
Everybody say hail, hail, everybody
Hail, hail rock and roll
Hail, hail rock and roll

Maybe we can go downtown
I'll teach you things you never learned in school
I got an A in chugging but my major is hugging
And I really think you're cool

Little darlin', breaking up is hard to do
But making up is so much fun
When you do it to the music by the light of the moon
You'll be in love when Mr. Postman comes
Everybody say hail, hail, everybody
Hail, hail rock and roll
Hail, hail rock and roll
Hail, hail rock and roll
