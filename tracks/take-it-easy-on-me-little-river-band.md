It used to be so easy to be your lover
We wandered through the days like they had no end
But now that you are gone I'm under cover
I just can't think about you as a friend

Take it easy on me
It should be easy to see
I'm getting lost in a crowd
Hear me crying out loud
Just want you to know
I know that you have to go
It's all up to you but whatever you do
Take it easy on me

So now I'll go the minstrel road without
I know there will be times when I need you there
And each night as I sing those songs about you
I'll think back to the time when you used to care

Take it easy on me
It should be easy to see
I'm getting lost in a crowd
Hear me crying out loud
Just want you to know
I know that you have to go
It's all up to you but whatever you do
Take it easy on me

Take it easy on me
Oh baby don't leave me crying
It should be easy to see
I've needed you for so long
Just one more chance with you
One more chance with you, take a chance?
Come on and take a chance

Take it easy on me
It should be easy to see
I'm getting lost in a crowd
Hear me crying out loud
Just want you to know
I know that you have to go
It's all up to you but whatever you do
Take it easy on me

It's still up to you but whatever you do
Take it easy on me
