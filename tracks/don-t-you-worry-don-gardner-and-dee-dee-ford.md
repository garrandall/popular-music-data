Don't you weep
Don't you worry
Stop your worrying
Daddy don't want you to worry

Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah

Girl you know I'm true
I love only you
I'm gonna do
All the things I said I'd do

Stop your worrying
Stop your worrying
I'm gonna be good to you
All the things that you want to do

Well have no fears
I'll always be here
Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa
Oh don't worry

Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah

Girl I'm coming back to stay
Gonna love you night and day
Gonna be good to you
All the things that you want to do

Well have no fears
You know daddy will always be here
I'm gonna do all the things I said I'd do
Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa
Oh oh don't you worry
