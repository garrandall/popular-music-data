People rushing pushing shoving trying to get by
Everybody's got a place to go or something to try
Me I'm like a rifle heading straight for the sky
I can fly I can fly I can fly

Nothing's going to stop me until I finally get there
I'll be climbing up the ladder and making my share
Going to set the world on fire so you better beware
I can fly I can fly I can fly

Top of the world that's my new destination
Top of the world you better make my reservation
Top of the world it's going to be a straight sensation
Top of the world. Top of the world

Had my share of nothing being stuck on the ground
I was stumbling fumbling just another face in the crowd
Now that hoping chasing nothing holding me down
I can fly I can fly I can fly

Top of the world that's my new destination
Top of the world you better make my reservation
Top of the world it's going to be a straight sensation
Top of the world. Top of the world

Alright
Alright
Brothers and sisters better listen to me
This is a world of reality
I'm going to make it and I don't care how
So here I come my time is now

Top of the world (la la la la)
Top of the world (la la la la)
Top of the world (la la la la)
Top of the world (la la la la)

Top of the world (la la la la)
Top of the world (la la la la)
Top of the world (la la la la)
Top of the world (la la la la)
