Well turn that bottle up and drank it
Crank that jukebox up and Hank it
Bartender, pour another round
Here's to our best bad decisions
Situation no conditions
Oh and memories we all need to drown
So fill your cup and raise it up
Jump in and join the club
And float this Whisky River reservoir
We're gonna spend the weekend
In the deep end
Of a Dive Bar

'Cause up in here you're not the only
Loved-and-left-her-lost-and-lonely-one
Who's ever swam against the tide (Woo)
Thinkin' this is your oasis
It's the safest of the places (Hey, I like that)
That a broken heart can find to hide
So here's a toast coast-to-coast
With a big ol' adios
To wishes wasted on them fallin' stars
We're gonna spend the weekend
In the deep end
Of a Dive Bar

Yeah it's just chapter after chapter
Of happy never after
But that's just the way the story goes
For some bar stool believers
Wear our heart out on our sleevers
Just goin' where the neon glows

Yeah it's just chapter after chapter
Of happy never after
But that's just the way the story goes
Yeah we're just never quite belongers
Hanger-oners way too longers
Just buzzin' where the neon glows

Problems we all got 'em
Let 'em sink down to the bottom
Doesn't matter who or where you are
We're gonna spend the weekend
In the deep end
The water's fine, y'all so just come on in
To the deep end
Of a Dive Bar
Of this Dive Bar
We're talkin' about a Dive Bar
