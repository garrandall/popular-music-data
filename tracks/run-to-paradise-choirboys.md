Baby, you were always gonna be the one
You only ever did it just for fun
But you run to paradise
Jenny, I'll meet you at the grocery store
You don't need a friend when you can score
You run to paradise

Johnny
We were always best of friends
Stick together and defend
But you run to paradise
And Mamma, now don't you worry 'bout me anymore
And I see you crying at the door
When I run to paradise

That's right, they had it all worked out
You were young and blonde and you could never do wrong
That's right, they were so surprised
You opened their eyes up
(opened their eyes up)
Opened their eyes up

You don't want anyone
(You don't, you don't, open your eyes up)
You don't want anyone
(You don't, your no fool)
Don't tell me, this is paradise
(Open your eyes up)
You don't want anyone
(You don't, open your eyes up)
You don't want anyone
(You don't, your no fool)
Don't tell me, this is paradise

Good times, why'd I let them slip away
Why'd I let them slip away
Cause I lived in paradise
Run to paradise
Run to paradise
Run to paradise

Jesus say's it's gonna be alright
He's gonna pat my back so I can walk in the light
(That's right!)
You don't mind if I abuse myself
So I can hold my head up
(Hold my head up)
Hold my head up

You don't want anyone
(You don't, hold your head up)
You don't want anyone
(You don't, your no fool)
Don't tell me, this is paradise
(Open your eyes up)
You don't need anyone
You don't need anyone (you don't)
You'll tell me, this is paradise

You don't want anyone
(You don't, hold your head up)
You don't want anyone
(You don't, your no fool)
You'll tell me, this is paradise
(Open your eyes up)
You don't need anyone
You don't want anyone, (you don't)
You'll tell me, this is paradise
