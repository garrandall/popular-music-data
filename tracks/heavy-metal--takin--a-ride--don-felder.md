Drive it on up and let's cruise a while
Leave your troubles far behind
You can hedge your bet on a clean Corvette
To get you there right on time
Now if you're ready to dive into overdrive
Baby, the green lights are on
It's like you're running your brain on some high octane
Every time she reaches fully blown


Won't you take that ride on heavy metal?
It's the only way that you can travel down that road
Satisfied on heavy metal
Baby won't you ride, ride it until it explodes

Heavy metal


My oh my, how this lady can fly
Once she starts rollin' beneath you
You know you just can't lose, the way she moves
You wait for her to finally release you
It's not a big surprise to feel your temperature rise
You've got a touch of redline fever
'Cause there is just one cure that we know for sure
You just become a heavy metal believer


Won't you take that ride on heavy metal?
It's the only way that you can travel down that road
Satisfied on heavy metal
Baby won't you ride, ride it until it explodes

Heavy metal


Heavy metal
Heavy metal
