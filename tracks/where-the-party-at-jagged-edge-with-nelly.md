June's Diary
Y'all ready to get lit
Ha ha


Everybody, put your hands up, throw 'em up
When the beat come back around e'rybody

Don't be trippin' when you see us in the club
Just show a little love, represent your side like me
Cause 'round here if you slick pick a hot one
Ride shotgun, couple of 'em got one
Belvedere in the rear of the club
Pulled up on dubs yeah we 'bout to go and buy the bar up
JD so for sure we ain't playin'
Hang with no lames, hit the park and sayin'

Ay, where the party at? (Where the party at)
Girls is on the way, where the Bacardi at? (Bacardi at, yeah)
Bottles and models, talkin' all a that
Know I can't forget about my thugs
Where the party at?
And all my girls
Where the party at?
Off in the club
Where the party at?
If the party's where you're at let me hear you say

If the party's where you're at just let me know

All the girls in the club in they best outfits
Just showin' that skin, tryna make these niggas wanna spit
Where you been boy? You and your friend
Need to come to the back where we got it locked down
In your white t-shirt or a three-piece suit
Don't matter what you wear all that matters is who you with
Some jiggy and some are straight grindin'
All up in the club just to have a good time

Ay, where the party at?
Girls is on the way, where the Bacardi at?
Bottles and models, talkin' all a that
Know I can't forget about my thugs
Where the party at?
And all my girls
Where the party at?
Off in the club
Where the party at?
If the party's where you're at let me hear you say

If the party's where you're at just let me know

Just show me where that party at dirty
Somewhere where it's crackin' right around one-thirty
Never get done too early
Come in as is, doo-rags and Tims
I'm rollin' past his, his little Jag and Benz
With the rolls, not the one with the stem, the one with the rims
The one that seem to make more enemies than friends
I'm slidin' in past doors, both eyes closed
Both arms rose, both charms froze
With the JD JD Squa Squad till death
Buyin' bottles, bottles, until it ain't none left
I'm quick to go left, I blaze with no rep
We jams more than them, baby show me the club
I'm like "hey, where that Bacardi at?"
Come and mix it with the Cris', baby, what's wrong with that?
We in the V.I.P. twisted, down right spliffed it
Two way and shit, actin' like they missed it

Ay, where the party at?
Girls is on the way, where the Bacardi at?
Bottles and models, talkin' all a that
Know I can't forget about my thugs
Where the party at?
And all my girls
Where the party at?
Off in the club
Where the party at?
If the party's where you're at let me hear you say

If the party's where you're at just let me know
(Just let me know)


Just put your hands up, throw 'em up
Right side, just put your hands up, throw 'em up
Everybody, put your hands up, throw 'em up
When the beat come back do do it do do it again
Eastside run this mutha for ya? (Hell yeah)
Do my southside run this mutha for ya? (Hell yeah)
And them haters ain't hittin' on, ain't talkin' 'bout us
And they look like
If the party's where you're at let me hear you say
