This is, this is,
This is, this is,
Im about Unity,
Greetings from Miami Dade County Florida

Listennn,


One's for the trouble,
Two's for the show,
Three's for the base and that limelight glow,
I know, you thinking that this game is over,
Oh no, the wait is over,
New York is back.

Lemme see your hands, wave em side to side
Put em up high, lets ride because
New York is back

Lemme see your hands, wave em side to side
Put em up high, lets ride because
New York is back


Yo the hammer and the muzzle came together,
All I had did was hold on to the pieces untill the puzzle came together,
Before it all got hyped,
I was in the corridor,
Apple before it got riped.
So I aint gotta act like,
I'm on top of, or in front of them,
If I aint the best dog then I'm one of them,
Listenn I'm a different kind of boss,
I'm Cut from a different kind of cloth,
These niggas is different kind of soft.
Everybody know it all,
Nobody follow a protocal,
The money's only good until you blow it all.
Stacking every cents,
Guliani knocked John Gotti, What?
So now he's running for president.
It's a shame what the game's became,
But the truth is,
There's really nobody to blame,
But the music.
Lets give it a minute,
Wtih no wack gimmicks,
Just hard beats and rhymes,
blow breath back in it.


One's for the trouble,
Two's for the show,
Three's for the base and that limelight glow,
I know, you thinking that this game is over,
Oh no, the wait is over,
New York is back.

Lemme see your hands, wave em side to side
Put em up high, lets ride because
New York is back

Lemme see your hands, wave em side to side
Put em up high, lets ride because
New York is back


Mutha Fucka i'm the heart and sole of this,
You claim king, but we in control of this,
Name another rapper you see on the streets,
huggin the block at the height of a beef,
Yellow tape and white sheets,
Yea that's my back drop whenever I speak,
I know alotta y'all would love to ice me,
make my head jerk like I'm doing the hyphy.
But that'll never happen, get on some sick shit,
Like fifteen in you, and one in your infant,
Joe's the business, Ask about me,
In the middle of the desert,
and they still can drought me.
You know Coka baby he stay on that new york shit,
You see weezy coming down on that forklift,
And money aint a thing, unless he come off with
Then Ima have to hit em with these little bricks often.


One's for the trouble,
Two's for the show,
Three's for the base and that limelight glow,
I know, you thinking that this game is over,
Oh no, the wait is over,
New York is back.

Lemme see your hands, wave em side to side
Put em up high, lets ride because
New York is back

Lemme see your hands, wave em side to side
Put em up high, lets ride because
New York is back


New york, New York nigga never went no where,
I just took off a couple of years,
But Now I'm back on my day to day,
Old school, Gucci frames like day to day,
Who gone tell New york times up, Flava flav,
Cuz as much as things change it remains the same
And you can gimme the city of God
And Mecca, the temple, the mas
An inspiration, the inception, The art..
Of Hip Hip was born
And the rap game was formed
From niggas dead broke, sell drugs, bear arms
Against all odds, 
and argue all day about who's a bigger star,
Joe, Jada, or Ja.
SO close but so far,
So many there's no star,
I can't belive Fifty Cent and NY fell off,
And L.A. came back, and the south is running shit,
Then one blood group, shit's all developing, NEW YORK


One's for the trouble,
Two's for the show,
Three's for the base and that limelight glow,
I know, you thinking that this game is over,
Oh no, the wait is over,
New York is back.

Lemme see your hands, wave em side to side
Put em up high, lets ride because
New York is back

Lemme see your hands, wave em side to side
Put em up high, lets ride because
New York is back


Shouts out everyone
