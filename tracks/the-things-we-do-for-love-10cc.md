Too many broken hearts have fallen in the river
Too many lonely souls have drifted out to sea,
You lay your bets and then you pay the price
That The things we do for love, the things we do for love.

Communication is the problem to the answer
Youve got her number and your hand is on the phone
The weathers turned, and all the lines are down
The things we do for love, the things we do for love.

Like walking in the rain and the snow
When there's nowhere to go
And you're feelin like a part of you is dying
And you're looking for the answer in her eyes.
You think you're gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up.

Ooh you made me love you (you made me love you)
Ooh you've got a way (you've got a way)
Ooh you had me crawling up the wall. oooooo
ahhhhhhh



The things we do for love, the things we do for love.

Like walking in the rain and the snow
When there's nowhere to go
And you're feelin like a part of you is dying
And you're looking for the answer in her eyes.
You think youre gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up.

Ooh you made me love you (you made me love you)
Ooh you've got a way (you've got a way)
Ooh you had me crawling up the wall. 0Ooooo

A compromise would surely help the situation
Agree to disagree but disagree to part
When after all its just a compromise of
The things we do for love, the things we do for love
The things we do for love, the things we do for love
The things we do for love, the things we do for love
The things we do for love, the things we do for love
