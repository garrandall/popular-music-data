With time to kill and an empty tomb
I always find a way to pass the time with you
Dark and smoky rooms, I can hardly stand the fumes
Telling me that you mean no harm
You stand me up like a crutch, another arm
But only when I'm gone have I been away too long


No, you don't belong to me, I think you lied to me
And with my back against this wall, it's hard to be strong
No, you'd tell me anything, look what you've done to me
Still, I tell myself that tomorrow you'll be long gone


Any given time or place, I never will forget the disgrace on
Your face so full of love, will it ever be enough?
10 feet tall and bullet proof, I never thought that I had a thing to lose
Well, it looks like after all, I'm gonna have to choose


No, you don't belong to me, I think you lied to me
And with my back against this wall, it's hard to be strong
No, you'd tell me anything, look what you've done to me
Still, I tell myself that tomorrow you'll be long gone


You help pass the time, but I'm doing fine on my own
So there's no good reason why to live such a lie
Tell me, have I been gone away too long?


No, you don't belong to me, I think you lied to me
And with my back against this wall, it's hard to be strong
No, you'd tell me anything, look what you've done to me
Still, I tell myself that tomorrow you'll be long gone
No, you don't belong to me, I think you lied to me
And with my back against this wall, it's hard to be strong
No, you'd tell me anything, look what you've done to me
Still, I tell myself that tomorrow you'll be long gone
