I don't have plans and schemes
And I don't have hopes and dreams
I, I, I don't have anything
Since I don't have you
And I don't have fond desires
And I don't have happy hours
I don't have anything
Since I don't have you (I don't have) 
Happiness and I guess
I never will again
When you walked out on me
In walked old misery
And she's been here since then


Yeah, we're fucked!
I don't have love to share
And I don't have one who cares
I don't have anything
Since I don't have you


You, you, you, oh, oh!
You, you, you, oh, oh!
You, you, you, oh, oh!
You, you, you, oh, oh!
You, you, you, oh yeah!
