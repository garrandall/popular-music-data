Stay with me
Why must we say goodbye?
Darling there's a time to love
And a time to cry

Though I know
All too soon tears may fall
And leave this to recall
That you kissed me today
So let's love a-while we may
For tomorrow somehow
Comes the time to regret
Ah, but time ain't now, now

All I want you to do is stay with me
Don't let love pass us by
Darling there's a time to love
Oh, right now, and a time to cry

This shining hour is too sweet to be made
Awww, like a flower right now
Love can blossom I know, oh then fade

Hm, can anybody say
(Who can say)
Just when love did made die
Darling there's a time to love
(Time to love)
Why don't you believe me when I say a time to cry, hey yeah

Hm mmm
Oh wooo, girl
Uh huh, can you hear me talkin' right now, yeah
