The boys and girls of Napoli
Are whistling merrily
And here's the reason why
They're always happy as can be

(CHORUS)
Baciare, baciare
They kiss while they're whistling
Like this they go whistling
Each day and night
Baciare, baciare
Who knows what we're missing
If we don't start kissing this way

The boys and girls of Napoli
Just pucker up and smile
Cause kissing without whistling
Is considered out of style

(CHORUS)

Well, if the kids of Napoli
Can do it, so can I
Now, honey, pucker up your lips
And blow, why don't you try

(CHORUS)
