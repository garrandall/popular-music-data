Through the mirror of my mind
Time after time
I see reflections of you and me

(Reflections of)
The way life used to be
(Reflections of)
The love you took from me, oh

I'm all alone now
No love to sheild me
Trapped in a world
That's a distorted reality

Happinessyou took from me
And left me all alone
With only memories

Through the mirror of my imnd
Through these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control

(cause although you're gone)
I keep holding on
(to the happy times)
Oh, when you were mine

(all the love)
All the love that I've wasted
(all the tears)
All the tears that I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt girl
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects the love that used to be

(Reflections)
The love you took from me
(Reflections)
In you I put all my faith and trust
(Reflections)
Right before my eyes my world has turned to dust
(Reflections)
The way life use to be
(Reflections)
The love you took from me
