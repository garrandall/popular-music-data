Through the mirror of my mind
Time after time, I see reflections of you and me
Reflections of the way life used to be
Reflections of the love you took from me

Oh, I'm all alone now, no love to shield me
Trapped in a world that's a distorted reality
Happiness you took from me
And left me alone with only memories

Through the mirror of my mind
Through these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control
'Cause although you're gone, I keep holding on
To the happy times, oh, when you were mine

As I peer through the window of lost time
Looking over my yesterdays and all the love
I gave all in vain
(All the love)
All the love that I've wasted
(All the tears)
All the tears that I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt that you have caused
Everywhere I turn, seems like everything I see
Reflects the love that used to be

In you I put all my faith and trust
Right before my eyes my world has turned to dust
After all the nights I sat alone and wept
Just a handful of promises are all that's left of loving you

Reflections of the way life used to be
Reflections of the love you took from me
In you I put all my faith and trust
Right before my eyes my world has turned to dust
