Every time I think of you
I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here, and you're miles away
And I'm wondering why you left
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild
And there's a heart that's breaking

Down this long distance line tonight
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you

No matter what I might say
There's a message in the wire
And I'm sending you the signal tonight
You don't know how desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world I have no meaning
Though I'm tryin' hard to understand
And it's my heart that's breaking

Down this long distance line tonight
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you

No matter what my friends say
And there's a message that I'm sending out
Via telegraph to your soul
And if I can't bridge this distance

Stop this heartbreak overload
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what my friends say
I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you
I can't lie to myself
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I ain't missing you at all
I ain't missing you, missing you
I ain't missing you, no, no
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you
Every time I think of you
I always catch my breath
