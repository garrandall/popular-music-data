(Koo...Shit..Let Me Let It Out One Time, This Beat Go Hard, R Geezy)


At First It Was Nothing Butta Fucken Flange, Shit I Woulda Let This Girl Fuck The Team, Shit I Woulda Let This Girl Suck The Team, Things Changed Now Shes Seen As A Fucken Queen; It Was A Dream How I Met Hear On Broadway, With My Compadre Sippin On Some Andre, She Was A Lil Darling That said Lil Darlis, She Got Off Worked Looked A Lil Starving, I Introduce Myself She Said "I Noe Who You Are I'm Not Retarded", "Well Do You Need A Ride" She Said "I'm Good" I Said "Nice Get Dangerous But I'm Not Talking Bout Shooks" She Laughed Looked At Her Fone & Said "Come Home?" We Gonee, From Then On I Knew It Was Gravy, I Knew That This Condom Will Be Filling With Babies, I Knew That My Patnas Would Be Beggin To Hit It, & Gettin All Mad If This Bitch Wasn't With It, A Few Minutes With Her I Knew That She Wasn't, She Was One In A Dozen I Was Beggining To Love It, We Was Talking & Laughing Not Talking For Action, Just Talking To Talk & I Ain't Done That In A While, She Was Making Me Smile I Was Making Her Smile, Nd I Ain't Smiled In A While Either, Wata Fucken Evening This Is Gettin Deeper I Was Blessed To Meet Her

(Yeaa..Yea..& SHE STAYED ON MIND, ND SHE STAYED ON MY MINDD!!)


A Couple Days Later She Text My Fone, About How She Liked Me I Wet The Throne, I Text Right Back Dont Get Me Wrong, But Usually Its One Night With Me, Usually I Wouldn't Even Text Back Thats How I Knew She Had Me On Some Cat, Shit Eating Catnip Out Her Fat Tits, I'm Lookin In The Mirror What Happend To That Pimp?, She Was On Her Way She Gone Be Here In An Hour, I Took An Extra Shower , This Must Be Love Cause Before I Wouldn't Give A Fuck, Damn Whats Happening Man I Really Cant Let This Happen Again, I Remember Back When I Fell In Love With A Girl Who Marked My Heart Like Grafitti On A Mural, I Promised Myself Id Be Honest With Myself & Understand, That All These Women Got Other Plans Or Another Man, When She Came To The Door I Forgot About That Whore, Forgot About The Promises, I Took Off Her Garments Threw Her On The Couch, Feel Like  Came Out, What Is This About, I Don't Even Kiss And I Gave Her Mouth To Mouth, I Shoulda Been Stricter Now I'm Fucken A Stripper 

(& Thats All Bad Man, I Feel Like T-Pain In This Muthafucka Man)


Man She Had The Pretiest Hands & Toes, I Shoulda Learned From Amber Rose, Now I'm Feeling Like Kanye West, Let Me Bring It Back Tell You Bout This Mess, I Thought It Was All Sweet, But This Chick Was A Dope Chase, This Freak Brought Me Back To My Old Days, Yeah She Cheated With A Rapper Not Only Did She Cheat, The Rapper Was Weak, Uh Oh Shithead Bitch I Shoulda Pissed On Yaa, That First Night I Shoulda Dissed On Yaa, Thats What Happens When You Follow Your Boner, When You Go To War And The Big Head Loses, Your Heart Gets Bruises, Why Did I Chose This, I Was So Foolish I Was So Stupid Took Her To Prove It, Now Times Lost & I Cant Recoup It, Now I'm Back To My Maccin, When Fun Turned To Love Thats What Happened, These Girls Attractive & I Got A Passion For Smashin, But From Here On Out Its Only Crackin, But One Night When Sunlight Comes Were Done, Its Over This Is The Tale Of A Too Much Liquor & A Stripper Bad Mixture (Haha Roach Gigz Baby, Shout Out To My Strippers Thoe I Love Ya)
