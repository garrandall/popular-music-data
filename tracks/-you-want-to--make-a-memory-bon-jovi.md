Hello again, it's you and me
Kinda always like it used to be
Sippin' wine, killing time
Trying to solve life's mysteries.
How's your life, it's been a while
God it's good to see you smile
I see you reaching for your keys
Looking for a reason not to leave.

If you don't know if you should stay
If you don't say what's on your mind
Baby just, breathe there's no where else tonight we should be-
You wanna make a memory.

I dug up this old photograph
Look at all that hair we had
It's bittersweet to hear you laugh
Your phone is ringing, I don't wanna ask.

If you go now, I'll understand
If you stay, hey, I got a plan
You wanna make a memory
You wanna steal a piece of time
You could sing a melody to me
And I could write a couple lines
You wanna make a memory.

If you don't know if you should stay
And you don't say what's on your mind
Baby just, breathe there's no where else tonight we should be-
You wanna make a memory
You wanna steal a piece of time
You could sing a melody to me
And I could write a couple lines
You wanna make a memory
You wanna make a memory
