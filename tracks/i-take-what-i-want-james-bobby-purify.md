Huh!
I take what I want
I'm a bad go-getter, yeah
Huh, yes I am
I never lose, huh
And I never quibble, yeah
Oh, no
'Cause I take what I want
Baby, and I, I want you, yeah you

Huh, I've been watching you walk by
And I, I haven't said a word, not one word
But now I'm ready to get you
And I'm gonna make you my girl
My lovin' girl
'Cause I take what I want
Baby I, I want you
Yeah, you
Huh!

Gonna pick you up now
And carry you away, yes I am
So you'd better pack up now, baby
Pack 'em up today

'Cause here I come
Just a big, bad man
And when I walk away, baby
You'll be holding my hand

'Cause I take what I want
I'm a bad go-getter, yeah, huh, yes I am
But now I'm ready to get you, baby
And I'm gonna make you my girl
My lovin' girl

'Cause I take what I want (yeah, yeah)
Baby I, I want you
Nobody but you, baby
I take what I want
I'm a bad go-getter, yeah

I take what I want
I'm a bad go-getter, yeah
Yes, I am

Yes I take...
