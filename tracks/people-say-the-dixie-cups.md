Don't you ever leave me sad and blue
Don't you ever tell me we are though
Don't you ever hurt me if you do
Everything they're saying will be true

People say, it's just a summer romance
People say, our love won't last for long
They're so sure, we will part
But I know deep in my heart
That they are wrong

(Well, I don't care what the people say)
So wrong (I don't really care what the)

People say, it's just the way the stars shine
And it really isn't love at all
But each time that we kiss
I just know we'll be like this
Summer, winter, and fall...

(I don't care what the people say) oh, oh, oh
(I don't really care what the people say)

Don't you ever leave me sad and blue
Don't you ever tell me we are through
Don't you ever hurt me, if you do
Everything you're saying will be true

People say, it's just a summer romance
But I know our love is here to stay
Let's go strolling by the sea
Cause it doesn't bother me
What the people say

(Well I don't care what the people all say)
What the people say, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I don't really care about the people)
What the people say
(I don't really care what the people all say)
What the people say
(I don't really care about the people)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.....
(I don't really care what the people all say)
What the people say
(I donâ€™t really care about the people)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.....
