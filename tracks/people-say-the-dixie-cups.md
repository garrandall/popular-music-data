That bucket of bolts in the driveway
It's old but it's still fast
And the weeds out in the front yard
When they're green, they look like grass
And this house we got
Well, it sure could use a couple shingles and a can of paint
But looking on the bright side
We're dry every time it rains

Yeah, I'm kicked back on the front porch
Drinking up this sunset
We ain't got a whole lot
But we got what we need
Yeah, I'm smiling 'cause I've been blessed
Sipping on the good stuff
This ain't a glass half empty thing
It's a half full Dixie cup

Kids chasing around that old dog
Being loud and dragging out toys
But you're missing out on a sweet sound
If all you hear is noise
And their mama sitting here beside me
Laughs and says, ain't it funny
Some people I know, well, they're flat broke
'Cause all they got is money

Yeah, I'm kicked back on the front porch
Drinking up this sunset
We ain't got a whole lot
But we got what we need
Yeah, I'm smiling 'cause I've been blessed
Sipping on the good stuff
This ain't a glass half empty thing
It's a half full Dixie cup

Some days I fall by the wayside
And let the devil have his way
He puts a hole in my cup
But this ain't one of those days, no

Well, I'm kicked back on the front porch
I'm drinking up this sunset
Hey, we ain't got a whole lot
But we got what we need
Yeah, I'm smiling 'cause I've been blessed
I'm sipping on the good stuff
Hey, this ain't a glass half empty thing
It's a half full Dixie cup

Yeah, I'm smiling 'cause I've been blessed
I'm sipping on the good stuff
Hey, this ain't a glass half empty thing
It's a half full Dixie cup
It's a half full Dixie cup
