Hay
Wouldn't it be nice to make a people tree
The likes of you
The likes of me
We can do it very easily
We barely even have to try
Let a little time go by
And pretty soon before we know it
(soon before we know it)

Suddenly the two of us are one, two, three
And there we see, our people tree
Soon the score is up to four or more
As other little branches grow
(Other little branches grow)
That's the way it's meant to go
And there's no way I know to slow it
(There's no way to slow it)

(What a source of mutual satisfaction when we see the tree bare room)
Evidence beyond dispute of all our mutual attraction

Nothing is as lovely as a people tree
(the people tree)
I think that we
(I'd think that we)
Would all agree
(would all agree)

Of the miracles that God created
Rated number one
Would have to be the people tree
