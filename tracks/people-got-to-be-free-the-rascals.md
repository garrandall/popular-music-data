All the world over, so easy to see 
People everywhere just wanna be free 
Listen, please listen, that's the way it should be 
Deep in the valley, people got to be free 

You should see what a lovely, lovely world this'd be 
Everyone learned to live together 
Seems to me such an itty bitty thing should be 
Why can't you and me learn to love one another? 

All the world over, so easy to see 
People everywhere just wanna be free 
I can't understand it, so simple to me 
People everywhere just got to be free 

If there's a man who is down and needs a helpin' hand 
All it takes is you to understand and to pull him through 
Seems to me we got to solve it individually
And I'll do unto you what you do to me 

Shout it from the mountain on out to the sea 
No two ways about it, people have to be free 
Ask me my opinion, my opinion will be 
Nat'ral situation for a man to be free 
Git right on board now 

Oh, what a feelin's just come over me 
Love can move a mountain, make a blind man see 
Everybody sing it now come on let's go see 
Deep in the valley now, we ought to be free 

See that train over there? 
That's the train of freedom 
It's about to 'rrive any minute, now 
You know it's been'a long, long overdue 
Look out 'cause it's a'comin' right on through
