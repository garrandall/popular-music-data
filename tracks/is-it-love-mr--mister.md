I say I love you, I hold you near me
You say I scare you, well that's your fear
I know the message my heart is sending
But you don't read it, you keep me guessing

Is it love, is it love you're after
Is it love, is it, is it love

The broken record goes round and round
Within a circle, without a sound
I'm under water, in overdrive
You hide in laughter, what's on your mind

Is it love, is it love you're after - why don't you tell me
Is it love, is it, is it love
Is it love, is it love you're after - why can't you tell me
Is it love, is it really love

(Solo)

Is it love, is it love you're after - why can't you tell me
Is it love, is it, is it love
Is it love, is it love you're after
Hey girl, I got to know, is it really, really love
Is it love, is it really love - hey

Is it love, is it love you're after - why don't you tell me
Is it love, is it, is it love
Is it love, is it love you're after
Everybody's lookin' for the magic love to come along and hope we'll find it
Is it love, is it really love... (to fade)
