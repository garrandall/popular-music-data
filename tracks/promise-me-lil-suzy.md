All of my life, you see
That I waited for this day
All this time I've been searching
'Cause I never knew you could make me feel this way

So much love
You captured my heart and my soul
And baby, I'm losing control
I don't ever want to let go of what you give me

Promise you'll never leave me
Promise you'll always stay
Promise you'll never runaway from my love
Promise me, promise me

If you could guarantee
That what you say is true
Everyday of my life, I'll be there through the night
And I'll give myself to you

So much love
I cherish the moments we share
The feelings that won't disappear
The magic you bring when you're near
Don't take that from me

Promise you'll never leave me
Promise you'll always stay
Promise you'll never run away from my love
Promise me, promise me

Promise me, promise

Promise you'll never leave me
Promise you'll always stay
Promise you'll never run away from my love
Promise me, promise me

Promise you'll never leave me
Promise you'll always stay
Promise you'll never run away from my love
Promise me, promise me

You'll never leave me, baby promise me
You'll always stay, that you'll stay with me
You'll never run away from my love
Promise me, you'll never leave me

Say you'll never leave, you'll always stay
Won't you tell me that you'll never run away from my love?

Promise me
