I've got something to tell you
I think that you oughta know
I've had my eyes on you, baby
Since a long time ago

And now I finally got the nerve
And I'm gonna make my move
Now don't you try to turn me off
'Cause it's gonna be hard to do


I got a thing about you, baby
Ain't nothing I can do
I got a thing about you, baby
A thing about loving you

Oh, oh, oh...

Ain't no two ways about it, baby
Your love was meant for me
I know that I can't do without it
It fits me to a tee

Oh, there's something about you, baby
Can't get you off my mind
I know that I can't live without you
Think about you all the time



Now ain't it just like a woman
When she knows she's got a man
She'll wring you out and turn you about
In the palm of her hand

And then she starts to thinking
That maybe she's put you in a bind
She'll give you just a little loving
That'll get you every time, but



I got a thing, I got a thing
I got a thing about loving you
