Funny how it's hard to find the words sometimes you know
Wishin we could read minds
Don't wanna let our feelings show
So even if you say you don't understand
I'm willing to give as much time as I can
Every time our eyes meet

Every time our eyes meet
Be talkin talkin talkin talkin to me (talkin to me)
Talkin talkin talkin talkin to me
Just ain't no need for words to speak (oh)
Cause every time
Be talkin talkin talkin to me
Be talkin talkin talkin to me (Talkin to me)

Your always actin so composed and cool
Never got to many words for me (To many words)
You always turn your head and make sure I see (Just to make sure)
Baby ain't nothin' wrong with the love
That you and I dream of
So sweet
Your actions say more than your lips can speak
My friends say that they just can't see (They just can't see)
How a love unspoken can be so deep (Can be so deep)
And every time that you look my way
I see
What your heart wants to say to me

Every time our eyes meet (oh yeah)
Be talkin talkin talkin talkin to me (Talkin to me)
Talkin talkin talkin talkin to me
Just ain't no need for words to speak (Ain't no need for words)
Cause every time 
Be talkin talkin talkin to me (no no no no no)
Be talkin talkin talkin to me

Every time our eyes meet (My eyes meet your, meet yours)
Be talkin talkin talkin talkin to me
Talkin talkin talkin talkin to me (To me)
Just ain't no need for words to speak
Cause every time
Be talkin talkin talkin to me (Every touch you give is like your talkin to me)
Be talkin talkin talkin to me

oh yeah yeah oh
Talkin talkin talkin talkin to me
oh whoa yeah
talkin talkin talkin talkin to me

Every time our eyes meet (Every time)
Be talkin talkin talkin talkin to me
Talkin talkin talkin talkin to me (oh yeah oh)
Just ain't no need for words to speak
Cause every time (I hear you baby callin me just ain't no need for words)
Be talkin talkin talkin to me
Be talkin talkin talkin to me

No need for words
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah
oh oh
