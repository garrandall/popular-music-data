I can't feel, feel a thing
I can't shout, I can't scream
Breathe it out, breathe it in
All this love from within


I won't cry when you say goodbye
I'm out of tears
I won't die when you wave goodbye
I'm out of tears, out of tears


I won't drink, I won't eat
I can't hear, I won't speak
Let it out, let it in
All this pain from within


And I just can't pour my heart out
To another living thing
I'm a whisper, I'm a shadow
But I'm standing up to sing


I won't cry when you say goodbye
I'm out of tears
I won't die when you wave goodbye
I'm out of tears, out of tears
I won't cry, I swear my eyes are dry
I'm out of tears, yeah (Out of tears)
I won't cry, I'm gonna tell you why
I'm out of tears, out of tears
Out of tears


Let it out from within
Some you lose, some you win
I can drift, I can dream
Until I float off your screen


And I just can't pour my heart out
To another living thing
I'm a whisper, I'm a shadow
But I'm standing up to sing


I won't cry when you say goodbye
I'm out of tears (Out of tears)
I won't die when you wave goodbye
I'm out of tears, out of tears
I won't cry, I swear my eyes are dry
I'm out of tears (Out of tears)
I won't cry, I'm gonna tell you why
I'm out of tears, out of tears
Out of tears
