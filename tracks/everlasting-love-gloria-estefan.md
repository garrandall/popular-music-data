Hearts go astray
Leaving hurt when they go.
I went away
Just when you needed me so
Filled with regret
I come back beggin' you.
Forgive, forget
Where's the love we once knew?

Open up your eyes
Then you'll realize
Here I stand with my
Everlasting love
Need you by my side
Girl to be my bride
You'll never be denied
Everlasting love
From the very start
Open up your heart
Be a lasting part of
Everlasting love

Where life's river flows
No one really knows
Till someone's there to show
The way to lasting love
Like the sun that shines
Endlessly it shines
You always will be mine
It's eternal love
When other loves are gone
Ours will be strong
We have our very own
Everlasting love

Open up your eyes
Then you'll realize
Here I stand with my
Everlasting love
Need you by my side
Girl to be my bride
You'll never be denied
Everlasting love
From the very start
Open up your heart
Be a lasting part of
Everlasting love
