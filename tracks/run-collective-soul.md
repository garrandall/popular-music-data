Are these times contagious?
I've never been this bored before
Is this the prize I've waited for?
Now with the hours passing
There's nothing left here to insure
I long to find the messenger


Have I got a long way, to run?
Have I got a long way, to run?
Yeah, I run


Is there a cure among us?
From this processed sanity?
I weaken with each voice that sings
Now in this world of purchase
I'm gonna buy back memories
To awaken some old qualities


Have I got a long way, to run?
Have I got a long way, to run?
Yeah, I run
Yeah, I run


Have I got a long way?
Have I got a long way?


Have I got a long way, to run?
Have I got a long way, to run?
Yeah I run
(Have I got a long way, to run?)
Yeah I run
(Have I got a long way, to run?)
Yeah I run
(Have I got a long way, to run?)
Yeah I run
(Have I got a long way, to run?)
