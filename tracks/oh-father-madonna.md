It's funny that way, you can get used
To the tears and the pain
What a child will believe
You never loved me



You can't hurt me now
I got away from you, I never thought I would
You can't make me cry, you once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

Seems like yesterday
I lay down next to your boots and I prayed
For your anger to end
Oh Father I have sinned



Oh Father you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away


Maybe someday
When I look back I'll be able to say
You didn't mean to be cruel
Somebody hurt you too
