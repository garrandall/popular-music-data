Ain't got a Cadillac or big old De Ville
I'm just a little guy not a big tire wheel
But I can prove my love is true
On my rockin' bicycle that's built for two

We don't care if we live out of date
We don't care if we're a little bit late
Gonna make the scene baby me and you
On my rockin' bicycle that's built for two

We don't care, we don't mind
If we don't be in front, we be a-right behind

We don't care if they laugh at us
Let 'em take the bus and leave the cycle for us
They can have a Cadillac and T-bird too
But gimme my rockin' bicycle for two

Ain't got a Cadillac or big old De Ville
I'm just a little guy not a big tire wheel
But I can prove my love is true
On my rockin' bicycle that's built for two

We don't care if we live out of date
We don't care if we're a little bit late
Gonna make the scene baby me and you
On my rockin' bicycle that's built for two

We don't care, we don't mind
If we be in front we be right behind

We don't care if they laugh at us
Let 'em take the bus and leave the cycle to us
They can have the Cadillac and T-bird too
But give me rockin' bicycle for two
