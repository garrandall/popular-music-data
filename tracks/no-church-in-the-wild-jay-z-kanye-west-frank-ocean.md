Human beings in a mob
Whatâs a mob to a king?
Whatâs a king to a god?
Whatâs a god to a non-believer?
Who donât believe in anything?

We make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild


Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the coliseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rollinâ in the Rolls-Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, Iâm hidinâ from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
Iâm wonderinâ if a thugâs prayers reach
Is Pious pious cause God loves pious?
Socrates asks, âWhose bias do yâall seek?â
All for Plato, screech
Iâm out here ballinâ, I know yâall hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy, laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach


Human beings in a mob
Whatâs a mob to a king?
Whatâs a king to a god?
Whatâs a god to a non-believer?
Who donât believe in anything?

We make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild


I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me into your encryption


Coke on her black skin made a stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as thereâs permissionâ
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody witâout tellinâ me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun cominâ up, 5 a.m.
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinkinâ âbout the girl in all-leopard
Who was rubbinâ the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos, one read âNo Apologiesâ
The other said âLove is cursed by monogamyâ
Thatâs somethinâ that the pastor donât preach
Thatâs somethinâ that a teacher canât teach
When we die, the money we canât keep
But we probably spend it all âcause the pain ainât cheap
Preach


Human beings in a mob
Whatâs a mob to a king?
Whatâs a king to a god?
Whatâs a god to a non-believer?
Who donât believe in anything?

Will he make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
