Holly, holly holy eyes
Dream, a dream of love, ohyeah
Where I am, what I am
What I believe in
Holly holy, y'all


Hol-Holly holy dream
Wanting only you
And she come
And I run just like the wind will blow
Holly holy, y'all
Y'all help me


Sing a song
Sing a song of songs
Go on and sing, sing it out
Sing it strong
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah


Call the sun in the dead of the night
And the sun gonna rise in the sky, oh now
Touch a man who can't walk upright
And that lame man, he gonna fly
He gonna fly, gonna fly, oh


Holly holy love
Gonna take, take the lonely child
And the seed
Let it be full with tomorrow
Holly holy, y'all
