You take sugar and spice
Everything nice
And you got a little girl
You take snakes and snails
Some puppy dog tails
And you got a little boy

That's what love is made of
That's what love is made of

Snakes snails puppy dog tails
Sugar and spice and everything nice
Yeah yeah all right
Something else to do

You take a walk by the sea
Two hearts on a tree
And you got a little gladness
Blue eyes cry
Two hearts say goodbye
And you got a little sadness

That's what love is made of
That's what love is made of

Hearts say goodbye
Eyes start to cry
Heart on a tree
Walk by the sea
Snakes snails puppy dog tails
Sugar and spice everything nice
Yeah yeah all right

One more thing
You take a cruel word spoken
Pride gets broken
And you got a little break-up
You take a little bit of soul
Sweet words being told
And you got a little make-up

That's what love is made of
That's what love is made of

Words being told
With a little bit of soul
Pride gets broken
Cruel words spoken
Hearts say goodbye
Eyes start to cry
Walk by the sea
Snkaes snails puppy dog tails
Sugar and spice everything nice
Yeah yeah all right
