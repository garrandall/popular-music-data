Deep river woman
Lord! I'm coming home to you
Deep river woman
Lord! I know she's waiting
Just anticipating all my love

Spent a night in LA
Just another chance to see you
Just you and I
Wanted you to know
That my playing days are over
'Cause all I do is think of you
The writing's on the wall

Deep river woman
Lord! I'm coming home to you
Deep river woman
Lord! I know she's waiting
Just anticipating all my love

I've been out in the world
I guess the fast life had me going
Now all that changed
Finally made up my mind
'Bout the one thing I've been knowing
You're the only girl
I've ever cared for in this world

Deep river woman
Lord! I'm coming home to you
Deep river woman
Lord! I know she's waiting
Just anticipating all my love

Your kind of love, girl, is forever
Took me a long time to realize
That I've come so far
To end up going nowhere
Girl, I need you by my side

Deep river woman
Lord! I'm coming home to you
Deep river woman
Lord! I know she's waiting
Just anticipating all my love
