I told you once I'm a jealous man
But you never want to listen to who I am
We're divided, completely out of touch
I guess that's why we seem to fight so much

Believe me darling this ain't no game
If you think I'll be your fool
You better think again
I know you love me
It just ain't right
I'm sick and tired of fighting
with you every night

You say you don't wanna hurt me
But you're doing things I can't explain
Oh baby, why don't you leave me
Because I know you'll never change

It's only another heartache
Ain't nothing to worry about
Something I'm getting used to
Dragging my heart around
But one day soon
And it won't be long
Gonna find me an angel to carry me home
It's only another heartache
Ain't nothing to worry about

I'll find a honey to take a chance
And roll that dice into my past
She'll cover me for a little while
And show me love ain't out of style

I don't care how long it takes
My heart's in the hands of fate
Oh God I ain't asking much
Just a woman that I can trust

It's only another heartache
Ain't nothing to worry about
Something I'm getting used to
Dragging my heart around
Oh but one day soon
And it won't be long
Gonna find me an angel to carry me home
It's only another heartache
Ain't nothing to worry about

I wanna love that's strong and real
I gotta know just how it feels
Somebody to share my life
To hold onto through the night

It's only another heartache
Nothing to worry about
Something I'm getting used to
Dragging my heart around
It's only another heartache
Nothing to worry about
Something I may get used to
Dragging my heart around
