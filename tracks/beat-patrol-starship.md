Heaven move me, move my soul 
Here comes the beat 
Here comes the beat patrol 
We will dance... 

I will help you if I can 
I can change the way you feel today 
When your world turns upside down 
It's time to make the break and dance into another day 

And as the music starts to move you 
Then it's time to go 
Into the streets you dance 
And then you lose control 

Heaven move me, move my soul 
Here comes the beat 
Here comes the beat patrol 
We will dance, we will dance 
Heaven move me, move my soul 
Here comes the beat 
Here comes the beat patrol 
We will dance, we will dance 

This is the age when you must win 
Cos there is no gold upon the streets today 
You must find it from within 
Music brings the dream machine your way 

And as the feeling starts to move you 
Then it's time to go 
Into the streets you dance 
And then you lose control 

Heaven move me, move my soul 
Here comes the beat 
Here comes the beat patrol 
We will dance, we will dance 
Heaven move me, move my soul 
Here comes the beat 
Here comes the beat patrol 
We will dance, we will dance 

A say yeah, a say yeah, yeah, yeah 
What you say here come the what 
Here come the beat, here come the beat patrol 
Here come the beat we will dance 

Heaven move me, move my soul 
Here comes the beat 
Here comes the beat patrol 
We will dance, we will dance 

Heaven move me... I see it coming... it won't be long now 
Here come the beat, here come the beat patrol 
We will dance, we will dance 
(Heaven move me move my soul 
Here comes the beat, here comes the beat patrol)...
