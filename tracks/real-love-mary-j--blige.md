We are lovers through and through
And though we made it through the storm
I really want you to realize, I really want to put you on
I’ve been searching for someone to satisfy my every need
Won’t you be my inspiration?
Be the real love that I need


Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love


Ooh, when I met you
I just knew that you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you loved for me, you said I’m not the one
So I slowly came to see all of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspiration lead me towards a real love


Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
I got to have a real love


Love so true, and oh baby, I thought that love was true
I thought that you were the answer to the question in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong, if I stay strong, maybe I’ll find
A real love


So I’ve tried my best and prayed to God he’ll send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me towards a love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful, I can be your all and all
Ill give you good lovin' through the summertime, winter, spring and fall


Real love, I’m searching for a real love (Real love, real love)
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love


See, I'm searching for a real love and I don't know where to go
(Real love, I’m searching for a real love)
Been around the world and high and low and still I never know
(Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love)
How it feels to have a real love cause it seems it's not around
Gotta end it in this way 'cause it seems he can't be found


Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Real love
