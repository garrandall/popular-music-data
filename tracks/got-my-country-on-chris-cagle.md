I worked all week to make me some money
Bring it back to Mama, best give me some honey yeah
Cashed my check, got a pocket of dollar
Loosenin' the buttons on my blue collar yeah

Oh, this is what I do
This is where I stand
This is who I am

Living the song of a ramblin' man
Gettin' it done with my own two hands
Puttin' some green in a coffee can
For when I'm gone, when I'm gone

Trickin' my truck like a Cadillac
Crankin' it up in my cowboy hat
Rollin' and bumpin' to the Man in Black
Singin' along, I've got my country on

Rollin' it home five o' clock on a Friday
Gonna spend the next couple of days doin' it my way yeah, oh, yeah
Call up a few friends, build a fire in the backyard
Gonna do some chillin', chicken grillin', and guitars yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, this is all I know
This is where I'm from
This is what I love

Living the song of a ramblin' man
Gettin' it done with my own two hands
Puttin' some green in a coffee can
For when I'm gone, when I'm gone

Trickin' my truck like a Cadillac
Crankin' it up in my cowboy hat
Rollin' and bumpin' to the Man in Black
Singin' along, I've got my country on

Got my country on

I got a good piece of ground that my granddaddy gave me
Down the road from the church where the Good Lord saved me yeah

Living the song of a ramblin' man
Gettin' it done with my own two hands
Puttin' some green in a coffee can
For when I'm gone, when I'm gone

Trickin' my truck like a Cadillac
Crankin' it up in my cowboy hat
Rollin' and bumpin' to the Man in Black
Singin' along, I've got my country on (Got my country on)
I've got my country on
Got my country on, yeah, woo!
Oh, got my country on
Yes, I do, woo!
