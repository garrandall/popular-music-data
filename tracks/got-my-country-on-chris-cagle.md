I worked all week to make me some money
Bring it back to mama bet sheâd give me some honey, yeah
Cashed my check got a pocket of dollars
Looseninâ the buttons on my blue-collar, yeah.

Uh, this is what I do, this is where I stand
This is who I am,

Livinâ the song of a ramblinâ man
Gettinâ it done with my own two hands
Puttinâ some green in a coffee can
For when Iâm gone, when Iâm gone
Trickinâ my truck like a Cadillac
Crankinâ it up in my cowboy hat
Rollinâ and bumpinâ to the man in black
And singinâ along, I got my country on

Rollinâ it home five oâclock on a Friday
Gonna spend the next couple days doinâ it my way, yeah, oh yeah
Call up a few friends, build a fire in the backyard
Gonna do some chillinâ, chicken grillinâ and guitars, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, this is all Iâve know, this is where Iâm from,
This is what I love

Livinâ the song of a ramblinâ man
Gettinâ it done with my own two hands
Puttinâ some green in a coffee can
For when Iâm gone, when Iâm gone
Trickinâ my truck like a Cadillac
Crankinâ it up in my cowboy hat
Rollinâ and bumpinâ to the man in black
And singinâ along, I got my country on
Got my country on

I got a good piece of ground that my granddaddy gave me
Down the road from the church where the good Lord saves me, yeah

Livinâ the song of a ramblinâ man
Gettinâ it done with my own two hands
Puttinâ some green in a coffee can
For when Iâm gone, when Iâm gone
Trickinâ my truck like a Cadillac
Crankinâ it up in my cowboy hat
Rollinâ and bumpinâ to the man in black
And singinâ along, I got my country on
I got my country on
I got my country on, yeah, woo
I got my country on
Yes I do, woo
