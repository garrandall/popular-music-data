I make mistakes like any man
But I try to love you best I can
I can't convince you
Though heaven knows I try
I've tried to make you see
To make you believe

You're all that matters to me
The ground that you walk
The air that you breathe
Someday you'll discover
I don't want no other, believe me
You're all that matters, baby
All that matters to me

I know that you've been hurt before
But that won't happen anymore, no no
Just give your heart to me
And I'll guard it with my life
I don't know what I'd do
Baby, without you

You're all that matters to me
The ground that you walk
The air that you breathe
Someday you'll discover
I don't want no other, believe me
You're all that matters, baby
All that matters to me

People looking for paradise
Well, baby, I know that I found mine
And if you don't believe it, baby
Take a look at the love in my eyes
Oh I'll be with you, baby
'Til the end of time
I'll be alright, baby
Just as long as you're mine

You're all that matters to me
The ground that you walk
The air that you breathe
Someday you'll discover
I don't want no other, believe me
You're all that matters, baby
All that matters to me

You're all that matters to me
The ground that you walk
The air that you breathe
Someday you'll discover
I don't want no other, believe me
You're all that matters, baby
All that matters to me

You're all that matters to me
The ground that you walk
The air that you breathe
Someday you'll discover
I don't want no other, believe me
You're all that matters, baby
All that matters to me
