The night was black, the roads were icy
Snow was falling, drifts were high
And I was weary, from my driving
And I stopped to rest for awhile
I sat down at a truck stop
I was thinking about my past


I've had a long streak of that bad luck
But I'm praying it's gone at last


Gone at last, gone at last
Gone at last, gone at last
I had a long streak of bad luck
But I pray it's gone at last
Oo,oo,oo


I ain't dumb
I kicked around some
I don't fall too easily
But that boy looked so dejected
He just grabbed my sympathy
Sweet little soul now, what's your problem?
Tell me why you're so downcast


I've had a long streak of that bad luck
But I'm praying it's gone at last


Gone at last, gone at last
Gone at last, gone at last
I had a long streak of bad luck
But I pray it's gone at last
Oo,oo,oo


Once in a while from out of nowhere
When you don't expect it, and you're unprepared
Somebody will come and lift you higher
And your burdens will be shared
Yes I do believe, if I hadn't met you
I might still be sinking fast


I've had a long streak of that bad luck
But I'm praying it's gone at last



Gone at last, gone at last
Gone at last, gone at last
I had a long streak of bad luck
But I pray it's gone at last
Oo,oo,oo
