You know just what to say
Things that scare me
I should just walk away
But I can't move my feet

The more that I know you, the more I want to
Something inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday, oh

I didn't know that I was starving 'til I tasted you
Don't need no butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo
By the way, right away you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving 'til I tasted you

I didn't know that I... I didn't know that I... 'til I tasted you
I didn't know that I... I didn't know that I... 'til I tasted you

By the way, right away you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving 'til I tasted you

You know just how to make
My heart beat faster
Emotional earthquake
Bring on disaster

You hit me head on, got me weak in my knees
Yeah, something inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday, aye
So much younger yesterday, oh, yeah

I didn't know that I was starving 'til I tasted you
Don't need no butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo
By the way, right away you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving 'til I tasted you

I didn't know that I... I didn't know that I... 'til I tasted you
I didn't know that I... I didn't know that I... 'til I tasted you

By the way, right away you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving 'til I tasted you
You, yeah, 'til I tasted you

I didn't know that I... I didn't know that I... 'til I tasted you

By the way, right away you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving 'til I tasted you

The more that I know you, the more I want to
Something inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday
