You can't be true dear
There's nothing more to say
I trusted you dear
Hoping we'd find a way
Your kisses tell me
That you and I are through
But I'll keep loving you
Although you can't be true

Clouds Hide the sun
In the skies that were blue
As my heart says farewell
To the joy that I knew
Love to be real
Is a love to be shared
But I know that you never cared

You can't be true dear
There's nothing more to say
I trusted you dear
Hoping we'd find a way
Your kisses tell me
That you and I are through
But I'll keep loving you
Although you can't be true

But I'll keep loving you
Although you can't be true
