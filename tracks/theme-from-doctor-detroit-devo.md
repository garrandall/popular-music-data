Don't you stop
Don't you wonder why
Life itself pops in
And takes you by surprise

Don't you try to run
It gets you from behind
Like a common cold
It takes you for a ride

Now is the time
To call me doctor
This is a serious case
There's not much time
Now call me doctor
They love to watch him operate
It comes and goes
So call me doctor
They need a special technique
It grows and grows
Now call me doctor
Calling doctor, doctor detroit

Call me doctor (repeat)

No need to look
He's not in the book
The doctor's not an M.D
What he does this time he does for free

Now is the time
To call me doctor
This is a serious case
There's not much time
Now call me doctor
They love to watch him operate
It comes and goes
So call me doctor
They need a special technique
It grows and grows
Now call me doctor
Calling doctor, doctor detroit
