Pardon me, boy
Is that the Chattanooga choo choo?
Track twenty nine
We gotta get there on time

We can afford
To board the Chattanooga choo choo
We got our fare
And just a little to spare

You leave the Pennsylvania Station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner
Nothin' could be finer
Do another number down in Carolina

When you hear the whistle blowin' and make to the bar
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in
Gotta keep it rollin'
Woo, woo, Chattanooga, there you are

There's gonna be
A certain party at the station
Satin and lace
I used to call "Funny face"

She's gonna cry (She will cry)
Until I tell her that I'll never roam (I'll never roam)
So Chattanooga choo choo
Won't you bring me home?

She's gonna cry (She will cry)
Until I tell her that I'll never roam (Wah, wah-wah-wah)
So Chattanooga choo choo
Won't you bring me home?

(Chattanooga, Chattanooga) Won't you bring me on home?
(Chattanooga, Chattanooga) Won't you bring her home?
(Chattanooga, Chattanooga) Won't you bring me home?
(Chattanooga, Chattanooga) Won't you bring it on home?
(Chattanooga, Chattanooga) Won't you bring me home?
(Chattanooga, Chattanooga) Won't you bring her home?
