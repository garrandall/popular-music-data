Late in the morning
The boss is throwin' his hands all in the air
I'm given a warnin'
He says I'm losin' my good position there
But right now I don't care

Tell you what I did this mornin'
Tell you what I did last night
Looked into my baby's eyes
And kissed and hugged and held him tight

And I can't wait
To spend another lazy night
In my baby's arms
I tell you that I can't help it
I just can't help it

I can't wait
To spend another lazy night
In my baby's arms
I tell you that I can't help it
I just can't help it


Oh, to be in my baby's arms

Gotta be right here where I belong

It's late in the evening
You know they're jamming' at parties all around, and oh...
Rockin' and a-reelin'
And all of my friends are goin' out to paint the town
But I won't be around

Baby's gonna be right over
Told me that he won't be long
Got to light a candle up
And be right here where I belong

'Cause I can't wait
To spend another lazy night
In my baby's arms, uh-huh
I tell you that I can't help it
I just can't help it

I tell you that I can't wait
To spend another lazy night
In my baby's arms, oh oh
I tell you that I can't help it
I just can't help it


Oh, to be in my baby's arms

To be right here where I belong

Baby's gonna be right over
Told me that he won't be long
Got to light a candle up
And be right here where I belong

'Cause I can't wait
To spend another lazy night
In my baby's arms, yeah, yeah
I tell you that I can't help it
I just can't help it

I tell you that I can't wait
To spend another lazy night
In my baby's arms, yeah
I tell you that I can't help it
I just can't help it

I can't seem to help myself, oh, no
Never, never, never, never, never
No, no, baby

 Uh-huh
 No, I can't wait here
For those crazy nights, ah...

I can't wait (Baby)
To spend another lazy night (Oh, no)
In my baby's arms, oh, yeah
I tell you that I can't help it
I just can't help it

I tell you that I can't wait (Yeah)
To spend another lazy night
Gonna be in my baby's arms, uh-huh
I tell you that I can't help it
I just can't help it

I tell you that I can't seem to wait
To spend another lazy night (Oh, no)
In my baby's arms, uh-huh
I tell you that I can't help it
I just can't help it

I tell that you I can't wait, no, no, no
