Oh, sing it now

Oh, la de dah, oh, la de dah
Oh, la de dah, yeah, oh, la de dah
Oh, la de dah, oh, la de dah
Oh, yeah, everybody sing along

If you feel like you want a friend
Come on, come on

Regardless of the color of my skin
Come on, come on, come on
And if you won't discrimination to end
Come on, come on, come on
Oh, yeah, yeah, everybody sing along

Oh, la de dah, say it y'all
Oh, la de dah, come on, come on now
Oh, la de dah, oh, la de dah
Oh, la de dah, say it y'all
Oh, la de dah, oh, la de dah

Come on now, don't you be ashamed
Oh, la de dah, it can be a woman
