Counting all different ideas drifting away
Past and present they donât matter
Now the futureâs sorted out
Watch her moving in elliptical patterns
Think itâs not what you say
What you say is way too complicated
For a minute thought I couldnât tell how to fall out

Itâs twenty seconds 'til the last call
Going hey hey hey hey hey hey
Lie down you know itâs easy
Like we did it over summer long

And Iâll be anything you ask and more
Going hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
Itâs not a miracle we needed
And no I wouldnât let you think so

Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it

Girlfriend, oh your girlfriend is drifting away
Past and present 1855-1901
Watch them built up a material tower
Think itâs not gonna stay anyway
I think itâs overrated
For a minute thought I couldnât tell how to fall out

Itâs twenty seconds 'til the last call
Going hey hey hey hey hey hey
Lie down you know itâs easy
Like we did it over summer long

And Iâll be anything you ask and more
Going hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
Itâs not a miracle we needed
And no I wouldnât let you think so

Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
