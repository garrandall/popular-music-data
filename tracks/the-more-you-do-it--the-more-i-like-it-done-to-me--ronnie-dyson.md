Keep on doing, doing
Doing what you do
Keep on doing, doing
Doing what you do

You keep kissing me
And squeezing me, girl
All the time and I like it
Baby, yeah

But it's the way you do it
That keeps on driving me
Out my mind, yes, it is, girl

Cause you keep on kissing me
With your kiss, oh, Lord
And touching me with your touch
In all the right places
And I like it, baby, yeah, yeah

(And the more you do it)
And the more you do it
(The more I like it done to me)
The more I like it done to me
(I like it) I like it, baby
(I like it, I like it, baby)

(The more you do it)
See, the more you do it
(The more I like it done to me)
The more I like it done to me
I like it, baby (yeah)
I like it, baby (yeah) yeah

There's no better feeling, no
Then when your body's up next to mine
Moving, grooving, yeah (yeah, yeah)
And even when we're not together
I think about you all the time
(Yeah, yeah) yeah, yeah

You keep on (kissing me with your kiss)
Yeah, and touching me with your touch
Reach out and feel me with your hands
I like it, I like it so much

I tell you the more you do it, baby
The more I like it done to me
(I like it, I like it, baby)
To me, to me, yeah

(I like it, baby) I like it, baby
I like it, baby (I like it, baby)
Yes, I do, yeah (I like it, baby)
I like it, baby, yeah

I just wanna tell the world
How I feel about you...
