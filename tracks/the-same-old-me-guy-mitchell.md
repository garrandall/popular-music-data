With the same two arms still missin' you
And the same old heart still bein' true
And the same two lips that still belong to you
And the same old me keeps lovin' you

When I saw you with your new love toda-ay
It hurt me in an old, familiar way
And I know there's nothin' I can do-oo
But I'll always be here waitin' just for you

I've tried ev'rything to drive you from my heart
But the mem'ry of you makes me feel so blue
And with ev'ry heartbeat I can feel the teardrops start
So you'll always find me waitin' here for you
