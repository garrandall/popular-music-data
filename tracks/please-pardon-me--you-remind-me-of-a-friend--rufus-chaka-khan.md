Please pardon me, but I'm longing to speak
I hope you don't mind my staring
I don't mind, cause your face looks so kind
Seldom you'll find someone so daring

You remind me of a friend of mine
Ooh, I've lost (the) time, yeah

Everytime I see your face
You remind me of that someone
In fact, it's true, it's you
Runnin' right into you

I hope you don't mind, you look like a friend of mine
And it's seldom you find a face that's so kind
I hope you don't mind, you look like a friend of mine
And it's seldom you find a face that's so kind

Please pardon me, but I'm all into spirit
I hope you don't mind my starin'
I don't mind, cause your face looks so kind
Seldom you'll find someone so daring

Everytime I see your face
You remind me of that someone
In fact, it was you
Runnin' right into you
