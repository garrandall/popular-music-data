I hear that time is just a watch that you wind
When you're down feelin' born to lose
I know some people get burned every day
Wonder how they make it through

I think I know what you're tryin' to say
Never seen you run from a fight
We're gonna live again to see that day
I believe everything is gonna be alright
Gonna be alright - gonna be alright

CHORUS:
I've seen the river and I've seen the road
Never looked back but I've always known
Someday I'll see you again - I'll Drink To You
I'll Drink To You!

Don't you get sick & tired of feelin' like that
Do you have to be unhappy to smile
Well it's the same old line the same old story
Time after time after time

You got to dance dream laugh and cry
Do anything that you like
We're gonna live to sing that song again
I believe everything is gonna be alright
Gonna be alright - gonna be alright

CHORUS:
I've seen the river and I've seen the road
Never looked back but I've always known
Someday I'll see you again - I'll Drink To You
I'll Drink To You!
