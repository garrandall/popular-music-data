I need you now
My King my love
I am more aware of this clay
Than all your power within
I wait for you
My hope my love
Because I've dreamed I'd see
Your kingdom come and I still believe

So come and breathe on me now
I am poured out for you
Come and release your power
I'm crying out to you, I'm crying out to you

What works have I?
What fruit to show?
I can hardly stand before your gaze
Yet I, I know
Your love, your grace
Has lifted me
But I need you now
So I can build with gold, pure gold

Your promise alone should be enough for me
Still I'm crying out to you, I need your touch
