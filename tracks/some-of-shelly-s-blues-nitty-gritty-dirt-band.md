Tell me
Just one more time the reason why you must leave
Tell me once more why you're sure you don't need me
Tell me again but don't think you'll convince me

You said
About fallin' in love again you'd rather be dead
When someone breaks your heart you cry your eyes red
There's nothin' so hard about the life that you've led

As far as I can see
There's no reason for goodbye
You're just runnin' scared
And that's something I won't buy

So you lose
I won't let you go there's nothin' to show but more blues
All this talk about leavin' is strictly bad news
So you settle down and stay with the boy that loves you

As far as I can see
There's no reason for goodbye
You're just runnin' scared
And that's something I won't buy

So you lose
I won't let you go and there's nothin' to show but more blues
All this talk about leavin' is strictly bad news
So you settle down and stay with the boy that loves you

Ah, you settle down and stay with the boy that loves you
Yeah, you settle down and stay with the boy that loves you
