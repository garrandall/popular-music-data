Honey, I will always
Be in love with you
Yes, I will
Honey, I promise
Always to be true
Yes, I will

(CHORUS)
Not for just one hour
Not for just one day, oh, no
Not for just one year
But I'll always be in
Love with you, yes, I will

Honey, I will always
Keep you by side
Yes, I will
Honey, I promise
To keep you satisfied
You know I will

(CHORUS)

The many ways that
The fellas speak of love
I know you'be before
And I hope that you believe
In me when I say, honey
I love you so

Honey, I will always
Be in love with you
Yes, I will
Honey, I promise
Always to be true
You know I do

(CHORUS)

Honey, I will always
Be in love with you
Yes, I will

Not for just one year
But always
