Oh darling, please believe me
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm

Oh darling, if you leave me
I'll, I'll never make it alone
So believe me when I beg you
Don't you ever leave me alone, leave me alone

When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know, I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know, I nearly broke down and died

Oh darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
So believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm

When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know, you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know, you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh darling, please believe me
I'll never let you down
So believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
