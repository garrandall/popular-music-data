You can build me up Just to break me down
Try to damage my heart but, I'm never gonna
Play the fool, no
Do ya get the message

Before I start giving in to the original sin
You better be true for my love to come down
To you now
Do ya get the message

There was a time when your love was so true
All my love was given to you
Now I see the course that you're taking
And I won't be your fool
I need to know what's on your mind
Satisfaction's easy to find
But I won't be Living dangerously

Time are changing
And there's one complication
Giving in to sweet temptation
Gotta understand to be down with my heart
You've got to give your love



You can build me up Just to break me down
Try to damage my heart but, I'm never gonna
Play the fool, no
Do ya get the message

Before I start giving in to the original sin
You better be true for my love to come down
To you now
Do ya get the message

Slow down you're movin' too fast
Good things are meant to last
Open your mind to what we could be
And it will set you free.

I don't know the games that you're playin'
Just know you think that you're stayin'
And if you think that I'm that type
Well here's a little insight

Don't you know there's just one complication
Giving in to sweet temptation
Ohh, you gotta understand to be down
With my heart
You've got to give your love
Got to give, got to give your love...



You can build me up Just to break me down
Try to damage my heart but, I'm never gonna
Play the fool, no
Do ya get the message

Before I start giving in to the original sin
You better be true for my love to come down
To you now
Do ya get the message

Just give your heart
And don't be cruel to me
Let's make a start
A new reality
And never part
I want you close to me Always
Always.

(Rap)
Boy meets girl and they kiss in the dark
Boy tries to make his mark
Girl fantasizes of a dream
Of living in the lap of luxury
Before long reality strikes at the end
Like a drug that wears out at the end
Of the night
And all she can think when he gets her home
Is where's he gonna be when she's alone



Na na na na na oh yeah
Na na na na na oh yeah

Better stop foolin' with my love

Do you get the message

Oh yeah

Ain't gonna be your fool no more

Ain't gonna be your fool...
