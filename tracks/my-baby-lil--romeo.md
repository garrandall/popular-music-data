(Hotline
Can I request a song
Yeah
My Baby by lil Romeo (laugh)
You got it)

Oh Romeo give me a chance
Unt unh too young I don't need a girlfriend
Walk me home from school anyway?
Ha ha O.K.
Oh Romeo the cutest boy I know
I know I know
So let me be your girlfriend

They call me lil P, I represent the CP3
Calliope heard me, straight from New Orleans
Gotta Uncle named Silkk and a Uncle named C
I been dribbling the ball since the age of 3
I got game like Kobe, dunk it like Poppa P
Once I'm in the zone ain't no stoppin' me
You can jumpa baby humma girls be jockin' me
P Miller wear NO Limit gear from head to feet
Bridge:
It's like that woeday (got me crazy)
It's like that woeday (wanna be your lady)
It's like that woeday (want you to be my baby)
It's like that woeday (can't no girl fade me)
Meet me at the skatin rink

Oh, Romeo give me a chance
(Uh uh too youngI don't need a girlfriend)
Walk me home from school anyway?
(Ha ha Okay)
Oh, Romeo the cutest boy I know
(I know, I know)
So let me be your girlfriend?

11 years old, makin' A's and B's
And these lil mommy's can't keep their hands off me
When you see in the streets holla what's up doc
I gotta a bugs bunny chain wit a matchin' watch
I make you jump like Kris Kross, bounce like Bow
I'm the next generation, I came to lock it down
I'm a little boy, but live a big man's life
I got girls passin' up wanna be my wife
Got grown women wanna be in my life
By the time I'm 18 I'm not gon be nothin' nice
I'm that R-O-M-E-O, after high school
I'm goin' straight to the pro's (bounce, bounce)

Oh Romeo give me a chance?
(Un unh too youngI don't need a girlfriend)
Walk me home from school anyway?
(Ha ha Okay)
Oh Romeo the cutest boy I know
(I know, I know)
So let me be your girlfriend?

Boy want u to myself
I don't want them girls around
Your the flyest thing up in here boy
And that's how it's goin down
I heard they call you Romeo
Well I'm your Juliet
You must be playing hide and seek
'Cause boy you're hard to catch

Oh Romeo give me a chance
(Unt unh too young I don't need a girlfriend)
Walk me home from school anyway
(Ha ha Okay)
Oh Romeo the cutest boy I know
(I know I know)
So let me be your girlfriend?

(Oh Romeo)
Why you boys make them elbows swing
Why you girls make them elbows swing
Repeat 9x's

Romeo boy do dat thang, Romeo boy do dat thang
Romeo boy do dat thang, Romeo boy do dat thang

(Throw em up get em up throw
Em up get em up throw em up get em up what)
(Master P while saying this is for the fly girls...)
Why you boys make them elbow
Swing why u girls make them elbows swing)

(Girls)
This is for the fly girls that punk it
(Boys)
This is for the fly boys that punk it

(Girls)
This is for the fly girls that's bout it bout it
(Boys)
This is for the fly boys that's bout it bout it

(Together)
Make em sweat, make em sweat
Make em sweat, make em sweat
Make em sweat, make em sweat
That's all folks
