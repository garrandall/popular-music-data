I've been away from you
For far too long
Too much absence
Makes the heart go frantic
I wanna tell you
What's been going on
Operator, get me Transatlantic

I sit alone as the night goes by
Stare at the phone
And wait for your reply

Long, long distance love affair, oh, oh
I can't find you anywhere, oh, oh
I call you on the telephone
But you're never home
I gotta get a message to you
Wanna tell you what I'm going through, oh, oh

What in the world's coming over you
How come you're acting like a total stranger
I try to reach you but I can't get through
I got this feeling that my heart's in danger

I got your letter
It was perfectly clear
Having a ball
And wishing you were here

Long, long distance love affair, oh, oh
I can't find you anywhere, oh, oh
I call you on the telephone
But you're never home
I gotta get a message to you
Wanna tell you what I'm going through, oh, oh

Premonition is a funny thing
Unfamiliar kind of vague and hazy
Like knowing when
The phone is gonna ring
Too many times and
It'll drive you crazy

I hear you echoing along the hall
Call out your name
But no one's there at all

Long, long distance love affair, oh, oh
I can't find you anywhere, oh, oh
I call you on the telephone
But you're never home

Long, long distance love affair, oh, oh
I can't find you anywhere, oh, oh
I call you on the telephone
You're never home

Long, long distance love affair, oh, oh
I can't find you anywhere, oh, oh
I call you on the telephone
But you're never home

Long, long distance love affair....
