String along, that's all I am just your string along
Someone that you just seem to bring along
Whenever you are all alone
Need some company you always turn to me.

String along, that's all I do you're sorta string along
You never seem to notice I'm alone
I just want you to want me too
How I hope and pray hat you'll need me someday.

String along, that's all I am just your string along
Someone that you just seem to bring along
Whenever you are all alone
Need some company you always turn to me.

Treat me wrong and maybe soon you'll lose your string along
Someone may come and bring a love that's strong
And wanna string along with me
Find somebody who won't treat me like you do.

String along, that's all I am just your string along...
