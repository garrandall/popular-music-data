Lights turned way down low
& music soft & slow
With someone you love so
That's where it's at, yeah

Your world turned upside down
You're making not a sound
No one else around
That's where it's at, yeah

Let me tell you
Your heart beatin' fast
You're knowin' that time will pass
But a-hopin' that it lasts
That's where it's at, oh yeah

That's where it's at, pretty baby
That's where it's at, oh yes it is
That's where it's at, pretty baby
That's where it's at, oh yeah

Let me tell you just one thing
To say it's time to go
& she says "Yes I know"
But just stay one minute more
That's where it's at

Oh let me say it one more time
That's where it's at, pretty baby
That's where it's at, I know that's where it's at
That's where it's at, pretty baby
That's where it's at
