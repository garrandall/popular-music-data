I've laid around and played around this old town too long
Summer's almost gone, yes, winter's comin' on
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
And I feel like I gotta travel on
Poppa writes to Johnny, but Johnny can't come home
Johnny can't come home, no, Johnny can't come home
Poppa writes to Johnny, but Johnny can't come home
'Cause he's been on the chain gang too long
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
Summer's almost gone, yes, winter's comin' on
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
And I feel like I gotta travel on
High sheriff and police riding after me
Riding after me, yes, coming after me
High sheriff and police coming after me
And I fee like I gotta travel on
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
Summer's almost gone, yes, winter's comin' on
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
And I feel like I gotta travel on
Want to see my honey, want to see her bad
Want to see her bad, oh, want to see her bad
Want to see my honey, want to see her bad
She's the best girl, this poor boy ever had
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
Summer's almost gone, yes, winter's comin' on
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
And I feel like I gotta travel on
