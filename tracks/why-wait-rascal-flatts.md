What'aya say girl, we do somethin' crazy
Quit puttin' it off, you know what I'm sayin'
Ain't like it ain't gunna happen, forever's a given
It's already written
Who we kiddin' baby, come on

The stars can't line up any straighter
Let's do it now and think about it later

Why wait another minute
For somethin' we should'a done yesterday?
I know a little church
With a preacher who could hook us up right away
Love don't need a reason
Baby I don't see how I could love you anymore than I do today
So why wait

Now I love your mama, let's save her some trouble
And your daddy won't mind if we save him a bundle
Girl it just so happens, that ring that you wanted
Well guess what I bought it
It's in my pocket baby, come on...

Let's get it done, let's get it on your left hand
This is me, girl, poppin' the question

Why wait another minute
For somethin' we should'a done yesterday?
I know a little church
With a preacher who could hook us up right away
Love don't need a reason
Baby I don't see how I could love you anymore than I do today
So why wait

Let's do something crazy
'Cause crazy's what you make me

Why wait another minute
Wait another minute come on
Well I know a little church
With a preacher who could hook us up right away
Love don't need a reason
Baby I don't see how I could love you anymore than I do today
So why wait
Why wait

What'aya say girl we do somethin' crazy
