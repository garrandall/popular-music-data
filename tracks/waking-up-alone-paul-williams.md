I took my chances on a one-way ticket home
Growing tired of strangers and the kind of life I've known
Thought the time for settling down had come at last
Guess I hoped to find a future in my past

Walk with me darlin' where the wheatfields used to be
I will tell you stories of my times across the sea
You're the legendary girl I left behind
Can't begin to count the times you've crossed my mind

And oh your children why the youngest looks just like you
She's the picture of her mother
But there'll never be another quite like you
You're an angel and a time that I don't know anymore
And so goodnight
I'll take my memories to bed
And know that I'll be waking up alone

I should have noticed that the years were slipping by
Still you're just as lovely as the day we said goodbye
Like an old familiar poem that still won't rhyme
I could get back to the place but not the time

And oh your children why the youngest looks just like you
She's the picture of her mother
But there'll never be another quite like you
You're an angel and a time that I don't know anymore
And so goodnight
I'll take my memories to bed
And know that I'll be waking up alone
