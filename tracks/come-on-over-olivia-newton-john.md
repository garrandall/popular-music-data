If my life gets like a jigsaw
With the pieces out of place
Come on over
Put a smile back on my face
And if all my bad days came at once
You would know just what to do
Come on over
Baby, you would see me through

And if you think I need you
Come on over
Bring your love around
You can dry away my tears
And if you think I need you
Come on over
Lay your body down
You know I will be here
So bring your love around

When I cannot see in front of me
And I know my darkest day
Come on over
You can take it all away

And if you think I need you
Come on over
Bring your love around
You can wipe away my tears
And if you think I need you
Come on over
Lay your body down
You know I will be here
So bring your love around

If you think
If you think I need you
Come on over
