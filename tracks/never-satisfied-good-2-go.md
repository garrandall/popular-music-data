Never Satisfied
Never Satisfied
Never Satisfied
Never Satisfied

I know I've given you all that I've could
No matter what I do to you it never good
I'm always doin' the best that I can
The way you make me feel I never understand

You don't appreciate anything I ever do (No you don't appreciate the things I do)
All you do is complain, what's the matter with you

Never Satisfied... You are...
Never Satisfied... Never Satisfied...
Never Satisfied... No...
Never Satisfied

I go to work each day while you stay at home
Lying in bed all day while talkin' on my phone
Then you tell me that you need time alone
Out in the streets I'm like some stakin' doggone hoe

You don't appreciate anything I ever do (No you don't appreciate the things I do)
All you do is complain, what's the matter with you... no...

Never Satisfied... You are... never...
Never Satisfied... Never Satisfied...
Never Satisfied... No...
Never Satisfied

I'll give the world to you if only I could
But you don't treat me like a gentleman should
I give you what you want and more than you need
I just can't understand why it's so hard to please

You don't appreciate anything I ever do (No you don't appreciate the things I do)
All you do is complain, what's the matter with you

Never Satisfied... (No no...)
Never Satisfied... (No no...)
Never Satisfied... (No no...)
I can never do egnough for you (Never Satisfied...) Can't you see my love is true
