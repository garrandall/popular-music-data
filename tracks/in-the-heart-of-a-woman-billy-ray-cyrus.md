She was all that I ever could have wanted her to be
She always knew just how to give the best of love to me
I thought I knew a thing or two about the ways of love
But it was soon to became so clear I didn't know enough
One day I found a note beside the ring she left behind
It said here is all you need to know for better love next time

Say you love her strong and true let her know all she means to you
Show her she is that special one who shines in your life like the rising sun
Give her love lots of room to grow treat her tender and you will know
The secret to the treasures of heaven in the heart of a woman

A bridge was burned and a lesson learned I never will forget
And for her timeless wisdom I'm forever in her debt
Last night I heard a good friend say he'd finally found the one
I told him to be sure these precious things weren't left undone

Say you love her strong and true...



In the heart of a woman

Say you love her strong and true...
Say you love her strong and true...
