You're home again, i'm glad you kept the key
Been waiting here, it seemed a million years to me
But hush now i know you're all cried out
It's all right inside, i've had no doubt
About your love for me
I can see behind the tears
I'm certain of the way we feel
And given time the hurt will heal
I need you, i think i always will
From time to time you play around
But i love you still
You tried them all, at ev'rybody's beck and call
Maybe you resist them all
When i tell you how i missed you
Fallen angel, i'll forgive you anything
You can't help the things you do
Home again so won't you close the door
Stay here with me and
We'll forget what's gone before
Just hold me tight
Our love is gonna make it right
Put shadows way beyond recall
The ghost has almost gone
Fallen angel, i'll forgive you anything
You can't help the things you do
