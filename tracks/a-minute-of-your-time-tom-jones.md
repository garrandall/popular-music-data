For you to think of me
It would only take a minute of your time
To spare one thought for me
Would you miss just one minute of your time?

When you are far away
I'd like to be part of your time each day
So think of me

A minute of your time
Is all it takes to bring us close

When we are far apart
And if I'm on your mind
I know that there's a chance
You'll ind that I'm there in your heart
One minute every day
May help to keep the wolf away
Until that moment you are back to stay
But better still I'd like to think of me
Every minute of your time
