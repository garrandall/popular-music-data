:
At the end of the First World War weary men returned from the battlefield in Europe to a land fit for heroes
Some how things don't turn out that way
You see the Mine Lords in the country told the miners that they have to work for longer hours for less wages
On the street through out the Rhonda valley in South Wales the battle cries rose
Not a minute of the day not a penny off the pay the miners went on strike. It was a long and bitter fight
Times were hard, children went hungry
Many people left the valley of Wales to try and make better life for themselves in cities all over the World
This song is dedicated to them and their descendants

So you went and left your the valley all those years ago
And many were the young men at the time
And as you left the station you saw that you were leaving
The rivers, the mountains and the mines

You came into the city left your friends at home
To make yourself a better life was your aim
The heartbeat of the Rhondda is not the thing to see
But it's always calling out your name

Come home, come home to where you belong
Back to the Rhondda, your land of soul
The bright lights of the city are not what they seem
Come home Rhondda boy where the valleys are green

:
So all of your life you've been home since you left your valley. Now you know nothing can compare
Where else in all over this wide world could you stand on a mountain and hear a thousand voices fill the air

Come home, come home to where you belong
Back to the Rhondda, your land of soul
The bright lights of the city are not what they seem
Come home, Rhondda boy, where the valleys are green
