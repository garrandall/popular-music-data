We live in cities you'll never see on screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
(Ya we sure know how to run with this)
Living in ruins of the palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team

First, what the fuck is a Chief Keef
Top chef, I'm cooking the beef beef
I'm from a city where niggas is street deep
We wouldn't show up to your show if you gave us a free seat
I'm Nelson Mandela with each speech
Cause I dribble with lyrics you can't reach
Rest in peace to Mr. Walker
It's ironic that a Porsche's where he has taken his last seat
The fast lane came and got you
Hopefully it don't put me up in that box too
Cause I'm doing what most dudes do not do
Box fools like Megyn Kelly and Fox news
Hey yo it's hard what I be now
Fake niggas in the crowd thinking that I'm senile
It's probably cause their girlfriend love the way that I freestyle
But hopefully they starting to see the shit that I see now



It all started getting high in the basement
Now I'm a mouthpiece for this live generation
Bringing my inner circle I need 5 reservations
Four chairs, one throne, and some fly decorations, uh
Y'all know me I'm hardly into trends
But I still think I'm looking kinda gnarly in a Benz
I lost a couple homies pour Bacardi in the wind
Cause like Hoodie Allen 'til the death I party with my friends
I swear to god, I'm high off of the life
City of god, I'm a god "shout out to dice"
American Pie, as long as I got a slice
I'll share the rest with my team, ya I got 'em for life
Damn, so walk a mile up in my shoes
Getting paid to write these stanzas and haiku's
Trynna be a nice dude
But life is like highschool
So you gotta fight through
Regardless if they like you




Iâm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air
So there
Iâm kinda older than I was when I revelled without a care
So there




We're on each other's team
And you know
We're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
And you know
And you know
And you know
