Featuring Sonny Charles

All right, everybody
Let's get on board
Gonna take a little trip
Down the river, river, yeah

Left a good job in the city
Working for the man
Every night and day

And I never lost
One minute of sleeping
Worrying bout the way
Things might have been

Big wheel keeps on turning
(Turning, turning)
Proud Mary keeps on burning
(Burning, burning)

Rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river
Rolling (yeah, yeah) rolling
Rolling on the river

Hey, yeah, yeah...

Cleaned a lot of
Plates in Memphis, y'all
Pumped a lot of pain
In New Orleans

But I never saw
The good side of the city
Til I hitched a ride
On a river boat queen

Big wheel keeps on turning
(Keeps on turning)
Proud Mary keeps on burning
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river
Rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river

Oh wee, it's all right

If you come down to the river
Bet you gonna find
Some people who live

You don't have to worry
If you don't have no money
People on the river
Are happy to give

I tell you
Big wheel keeps on turning
Proud Mary keeps on burning

Rolling (yeah, yeah) rolling
Rolling on the river
Rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river

Yeah, yeah, hey...

Rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river
Rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river...
