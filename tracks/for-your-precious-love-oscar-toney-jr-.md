Into each life
A little rain must fall
Every day can't be Sunday

Every smile isn't a
Smile of happiness
And every tear that's she'd
Is not a tear of joy

I'd like to take a little time
To dedicate this song
To everyone who's in the
Presence of my voice

Especially for those who have
Loved ones far, far away
Maybe he's across the sea
Or maybe she's just in another town

I can imagine when you're all alone
In the wee wee hours of the night
You just might decide to write
Knowing all the time
You just can't find the
Right words to say

You can say, darling
Your precious love
I give you the world
On a silver platter
But you know as well as I
That that would be a lie

Now, if you'll take these
Few lines from me
The lover you're trying to write
Will be such a comfort
To your loved one

Now listen

For precious love
I'd climb the highest mountain
I'd even go as far as trying
To swim the deepest sea

Now listen
Maybe this will give you a
Better understanding of
What I'm trying to say

For your precious love
Means more to me
Than any love could ever be

Before I met you
I was so lonely and so blue
For that's what love will do

Darling, here's what
Our so-called friends say

They try to say
That our love won't grow
But I just want to tell them
They don't know now

For as long as you
As long as you're in love with me
Our love will grow wider
Deeper than any sea now

And of all the things
All the things I ever
Wanted to hear you say
In this whole wide world

My, my, my, my baby
I'm your girl

Let me holler one time
(Your precious love)...
