You're the one, now, I know it
In time, I'm gonna show you
Day by day, I pick myself up
All alone and waiting for you

Take the key, set your heart free
I've got the luck and soul, too

Test of time, it's just a test of time
I can stand the test of time
Test of time, I'll make believe that you're mine
And it's just a test of time

When you're around, can't deny it
I'll always want you by me
It might be long, forget the time
Come to me girl, when you've waited

Test of time, it's just a test of time
I can stand the test of time
Test of time, I'll make believe that you're mine
And it is just a test of time

Side by side, is how we could be
And I'm here, anticipatin'
What can I do, you're just my kind
With me, no chance you takin'

I do the time till we do love
Shakin' hard and I'll be waitin'

Test of time, it's just a test of time
I can stand the test of time
Test of time, I'll make believe that you're mine
And it's just a test, a test of time

Test of time, it's just a test of time
I can stand the test of time
Test of time, I'll make believe that you're mine
And it's just a test, just a test, just a test of time

I don't mind, oh
Yes, it's true this heart'll keep on waitin'
Now I know it, say it over and over
Just a test of time
