Nine one, 27th Avenue
Walked up to the door
Hello, sir, how are you

No, I'm just looking for a
Friend living in Apartment 10
You say she's gone
Please, how long has it been

(CHORUS)
It's a big, big city
It's a big, big world
How's a boy gonna find
A little pretty girl
In this big, big world

Going out to
Find myself a telephone
Got a pocketful of dimes

I know her last name is Jones

Joneses, Joneses
Oh, I see, pages 19 to 23
Big, big world can be unkind
The phone just took my last dime

(CHORUS)
