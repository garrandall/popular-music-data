You got that look in your eyes
Something deep inside
And time will show
What you don't want to know
It's haunting you
Guess it's time to sit down with the truth
And tho' it comes as no surprise

Some things are not better left unsaid
Let them out instead
It's haunting you
Guess it's time to sit down with the truth
Got to get acquainted with the truth
Oh and it was here
This place that we hide away in
If it's gone now
It's best that a new place begin
We shared in the fantasy of
Knowing this love in our lives
Is it ever what it seems to be
Oh and if it's over
Let me go, love
Let me go, love
