Once I had fame
Oh I was full of pride
There were a lot of friends
Always by my side
But my fame oh it died
Now my friends begin to hide

Everybody loves a winner
But when you lose, you lose alone

Everywhere I turned
There was a hello and smile
I never thought
They'd be gone after a while
But my bankroll went down
And the smiles turned to frowns

Everybody loves a winner
But when you lose, you lose alone

Once I had a love
Oh but I wouldn't be true
To get back that love
Ain't nothing I wouldn't do
But I've loved
And I've lost
And now I paid the cost

Everybody loves a winner
(Say it again)
Everybody loves a winner
But when you lose, you lose alone
(Woah yea)
