(Hey) I took a couple of my dawgs on a lick
Do or die, gotta survive, pay the rent (Survive)
I was so broke that I could cry, I was sick (Broke)
Born in the wild, so many trials, I ain't quit
All the people I robbed, I brought 'em down, I repent (Down)
Dirtied the money, I let it drown, watch it cleanse (Cleanse)
Sellin' these pounds, a hundred times I jumped the fence (12)
Breakin' it down, I made a pound turn to ten (Ten)
Them hunnids ain't found, they in the ground, don't get spent
They in the ground
Way back in the time, black and brown, you get lynched
Black and brown
We was talkin' him down, he make a frown if he flinch
Gun him down
See the pain in my eyes, I hold it down 'cause I'm rich
Hold it down


Livin' in the street, concrete, get rough (Street)
Niggas tryna creep, we eat, gun bust (Creep)
Think about my history, back of the bus (Who)
Fought for the rights, but we still killed us (Who)
Tryin' not to be political, it was ridiculed (Real)
'Member I was in the middle school, with a fit or two ('Member)
Mama had the boy by herself, it was critical (Mama)
Started with the weed, then codeine, then a pill or two (Codeine)
Hit one lick, then I hit two (Lick)
Kickin' down the door, then I ran through (Woo)
Sticks in the van, this ain't bamboo (Sticks)
I got rich bought some land for my kids too (Whew)
Take the risks for my fam, for some damn food (Risks)
Take my bitch out to France, out to Canc√∫n (France)
My wrist like a dam, you can splash, pool (Splash)
Money root of all evil, but the cash rule


(Hey) I took a couple of my dawgs on a lick
Do or die, gotta survive, pay the rent (Survive)
I was so broke that I could cry, I was sick (Broke)
Born in the wild, so many trials, I ain't quit
All the people I robbed, I brought 'em down, I repent (Down)
Dirtied the money, I let it drown, watch it cleanse (Cleanse)
Sellin' these pounds, a hundred times I jumped the fence (12)
Breakin' it down, I made a pound turn to ten (Ten)
Them hunnids ain't found, they in the ground, don't get spent
They in the ground
Way back in the time, black and brown, you get lynched
Black and brown
We was talkin' him down, he make a frown if he flinch
Gun him down
See the pain in my eyes, I hold it down 'cause I'm rich (Woo, woo, woo)
Hold it down


Know some savages, they tryna clean up and they won't let 'em (Clean up)
Streets done made my heart so cold, need a whole sweater (Cold)
I was kickin' in the back of doors but I know better (Hey)
You expose what you know, then you go get it (Hey)
Sow what you reap (Sow) , sleepin' on my feet
Trust fund for my daughter, son, daddy plant a seed
No bond when you do a crime, slavery repeat (Slave)
Slick minded, they think we runnin' a treasury (Who)
Lost my homie, it keep on hauntin' me in my sleep
Lost my grandmama, whole family incomplete
Stabbed in my back a million times, this shit deep
I was hittin' licks doin' crime for my seed
Broke now I got 25 cars, it's a fleet
Take notes, make a bando turn Ferrari, I can teach
Struggled with the pain, but I still turned out a beast
I got out the chains, now the world belong to me (Hey)


(Hey) I took a couple of my dawgs on a lick
Do or die, gotta survive, pay the rent (Survive)
I was so broke that I could cry, I was sick (Broke)
Born in the wild, so many trials, I ain't quit
All the people I robbed, I brought 'em down, I repent (Down)
Dirtied the money, I let it drown, watch it cleanse (Cleanse)
Sellin' these pounds, a hundred times I jumped the fence (12)
Breakin' it down, I made a pound turn to ten (Ten)
Them hunnids ain't found, they in the ground, don't get spent
They in the ground
Way back in the time, black and brown, you get lynched
Black and brown
We was talkin' him down, he make a frown if he flinch
Gun him down
See the pain in my eyes, I hold it down 'cause I'm rich
Hold it down
