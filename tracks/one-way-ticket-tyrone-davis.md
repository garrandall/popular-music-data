It took a one-way ticket to nowhere
To make me know that I still care
Those lonely nights without you in sight
Were too much for me to bear

But, oh, I let my pride
Cast your love aside
It took a one-way ticket to nowhere
To make me know I love you
Baby, I love you
(It took a one-way ticket)

I tried to get you off of my mind
By wasting some other girls time
Didn't have no conversation
Didn't know my destination
I just laughed to keep from crying

My smile was out of place
It showed all over my face
It took a one-way ticket to nowhere
To make me know I love you, oh, baby
(It took a one-way ticket)

Oh, forgive me, girl
For I know now that it won't be long
But all you got to do is keep
A light burning in the window
Till T.D. come marching home

Cause I'll be there, baby
Cause I love you, mmm

That's why I'm coming back home to you
Cause I love you, oh, baby
Turn around, I got to see my baby
Right now, baby

I'm coming on home to you, mmm
Mama, mama, mama, mama
I got to have you, I love you...
