I can feel something just ain't right
I can see when you sleep at night
In your dreams there is no way you can find peace of mind

When we touch all the fires gone
Mean too much I won't let you run out of me
As I watch our love grow old, turning cold

Looking out for love in Siberia
Gotta look for love everywhere you are
Ain't nobody gonna take your love away
Looking out for love in Siberia
Checking out to see what our chances are
Ain't nobody gonna take our love away

Could it be I just need you more
Can't you see what you got in store
If you stay I will never let you go, oh no

Try to reach, try to hold me tight
One and each, we must try and fight
Get it cool where we used to be sincere 'cause we're
('Cause we are)

Looking out for love in Siberia
Gotta look for love everywhere you are
Ain't nobody gonna take your love away
Looking out for love in Siberia
Checking out to see what our chances are
Ain't nobody gonna take our love away

Looking out for love in Siberia
Gotta look for love everywhere you are
Ain't nobody gonna take your love away
Looking out for love in Siberia
Checking out to see what our chances are
Ain't nobody gonna take our love away

Looking out for love in Siberia
Gotta look for love everywhere you are
Ain't nobody gonna take your love away
Looking out for love in Siberia
Checking out to see what our chances are
Ain't nobody gonna take our love away
