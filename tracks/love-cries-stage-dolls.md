As she drives, through the town
Where she once, played around
In these streets
Oh memories, are what's left here

Little note, on her bed
Just some words, that leave it all unsaid
Oh Mama don't you cry
Hey Papa don't ask why

Love cries, love burns
Love drives you, to the point of no return
Love lies, love burns
Love drives you, to the point of no return

Restless boy, took her heart
Like a toy, he tore it all apart
In her mind, she'll never love again

With the wind, in her hair
She stops and says a little prayer
Oh Mama don't you cry
Hey Papa don't ask why

Love cries, love burns
Love drives you, to the point of no return
Love lies, love burns
Love drives you, to the point of no return

Under a purple sky
She turns her head
And says goodbye

Love cries, love burns
Love drives you, to the point of no return
Love lies, love burns
Love drives you, to the point of no return
