If you're sittin' out there wondering what to do
Me and the fellas got a message for you
(You ought to be havin' fun
You ought to be havin' fun
Put your troubles on the run)
The best things in life are free
(The best things in life are free)
(You ought to be havin' fun)
Makin' someone happy
(You ought to be havin' fun)
It'll make you feel so glad
Go out and love someone
Be as free as you can be, 'cause...
(You ought to be, you ought to be
You ought to be, you ought...)
(You ought to be havin' fun
You ought to be havin' fun
Put your troubles on the run)
The best things in life are free
(The best things in life are free)
(You ought to be havin' fun)
You owe it to yourself
(You ought to be havin' fun)
Don't sit there on the shelf
Go out and get some fun
I'm sure you will agree
(You ought to be, you ought to be...
You ought to be, you ought...)
(You ought to be havin' fun
You ought to be havin' fun)
(You ought to be, you ought to be...
You ought to be, you ought...)
(You ought to be havin' fun
You ought to be havin' fun
Put your troubles on the run)
The best things in life are free
(The best things in life are free)
(You ought to be havin' fun)
And come on to the park
(You ought to be havin' fun)
And stay out after dark
C'mon everybody, have fun with me
Have fun with me, 'cause...
(You ought to be, you ought to be...
You ought to be, you ought...)
(You ought to be havin' fun
You ought to be havin' fun)
