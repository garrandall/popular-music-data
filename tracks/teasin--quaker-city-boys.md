Teasing, were you teasing
The night you whispered
Love words in my ear

Fooling, were you fooling
When you said
I love you so, my dear

Were you deceiving
Make believing
Pretending that you
Loved me from the start

Gee, I hope it isn't so
It would break my heart to know
That you were only teasing
Sweetheart

Teasing, were you teasing
The night you whispered
Love words in my ear

Were you deceiving
Make believing
Pretending that you
Loved me from the start

Gee, I hope it isn't so
It would break my heart to know
That you were only teasing
Sweetheart

You were only teasing
Sweetheart
