My pretending days are over
Gonna leave the acting
To the stars in Hollywood

My pretending days are over
Gonna leave acting
To the stars in Hollywood
Oh, yeah, yeah

I should receive the Academy Award
For every girl I fooled
In this old town

I played my tricks on them
Told them they looked so sweet
When I knew all the time
Not a one did I want to keep

My pretending days are over
I'm gonna leave the acting
To the stars in Hollywood

My pretending days are over
I'm gonna leave the acting
To the stars in Hollywood

I used to masquerade
From one girl to another
But since I met you
I can't go any further

(Just one kiss) just one kiss
(From your sweet lips)
From your sweet lips
Brought me down, down
Down from my knees

My pretending days are over
And I'm glad I found
A girl just like you

My pretending days are over
And make mention
Else somebody see the truth

You made me find myself
I don't pretend no more
I stopped acting like someone
On a late, late TV show

(You, you, you, you)
You, you helped me find myself
(Girl, you helped me)
(Yes, you helped me to find myself)

And just because of you
(You, you, you, you)
I don't have to act like someone else
(I don't have to act like somebody else)

My pretending days are over
I'm gonna leave the acting
To the stars in Hollywood

My, my pretending days are over
I'm gonna leave the acting
To the stars in Hollywood

My pretending days are over
I'm gonna leave the acting
To the stars in Hollywood...
