Ever seen a blind man cross the road
Trying to make the other side?
Ever seen a young girl growing old
Trying to make herself a bride?

So what becomes of you, my love
When they finally stripped you of
The handbags and the gladrags
That your granddad had to sweat to buy

Once I was a young man
And all I thought I had to do was smile
You are still a young girl
And you bought everything in style

But once you think you're in you're out
'Cause you don't mean a single thing without
The handbags and the gladrags
That granddad had to sweat to buy

Sing a song of six-pence for your sake
And drink a bottle full of rye, mmm
Four and twenty blackbirds in a plate
And bake them in a pie, yeah

They told me you missed school today
So what I suggest you just throw them all away
The handbags and the gladrags
That your Granddad had to sweat to buy, ah, to buy

You gotta listen to what I'm saying 'cause I'm tellin' you, girl
Right where you are
Oh, withoout the handbgs
You're no superstar
