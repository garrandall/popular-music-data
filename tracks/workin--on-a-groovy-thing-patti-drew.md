When I saw you, I knew
That I was gonna love you
And every day I thought
Of how I'm gonna love you

Now you're here next to me
And ecstasy is a reality
I feel good when you are near
I'm so alive cause you are near


Working on a groovy thing, baby
Working on a groovy thing
Working on a groovy thing, baby
Let's not rush it
I wanna take it slow, yeah

Before I met you
I knew my lips were only wasted
Cause you have got the
Sweetest lips I've ever tasted

Music moves us along
Your arms around me
So snug and warm
Happiness is in my soul
I'm about to lose all control


Now you're here next to me
And ecstasy is a reality
I feel good when you are near
I'm so alive cause you are near


(Said that I'm)
Working on a groovy thing, baby
(Yes, I am now)
Working on a groovy, groovy
Groovy thing
