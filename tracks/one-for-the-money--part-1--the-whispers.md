Get on down
Heartbeat
Come on, do it
Hey, Hey
Come on down

Oh, all the people
Get up (get up) Get outta your seat

Everybody mingle
Come on and dance to the beat
Grab yourself a partner
Nice, get them outta their seat
Everybody stay free
Dance to the beat, just dance
Everybody dance oh

One for the money
(Two for the show) Well Well
Let yourself go now come on
One for the money
(Two for the show) Come on now
Three to get ready, let yourself go go go
Get on down hey

My life is precious, music will suit my soul
Everybody's proving it
Don't count on your own
It's hardly worth the time
If only the beat is fine
It's like fire, let's take it up
Just a little higher
And just a little higher hey hey

One for the money
(Two for the show) Well Well
Three to get ready
Let yourself go
I'm tellin' you
One for the money
(Two for the show)
Three to get ready, let yourself go go go
Let's get on down hey baby
Get on down

One for the money, well well
Two for the show
Three to get ready
Hey, hey
Ah
Oh, come on now
Three to get ready
Let yourself go, go go

Get on down

Just get on down
Everybody party
I only wanna dance
Come on, come on
Ah, well well hey hey

One for the money
Two for the show
Again, I, again, and hey
Come on, party down, party down, party down
One for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready
