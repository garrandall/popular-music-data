(Oh, let's go to Kansas City, now.)

I'm going to Kansas City, Kansas City here I come
I'm going to Kansas City, Kansas City here I come
They got some crazy little women there
And I'm gonna get me one

I'm gonna be standing on the corner, Twelfth Street and Vine
I'm gonna be standing on the corner, Twelfth Street and Vine;
With my Kansas City baby and my bottle
Of Kansas City wine

Well, I might take a train, might take a plane
But if I have to walk
I'm gonna fly there just the same
Yeaaaah, Kansas City here I come
They got some crazy little women there
And I'm gonna get me one

Well, if I don't leave that woman I know I'm gonna die
Got to find a brand new baby and here's the reason why:
Ya, ya, ya-eeeee eee, Kansas City here I come
They got some crazy little women there
And I'm gonna get me one
Ah - right

Might take a train, might take a plane
But if I have to walk
I'm gonna fly there just the same
Yeaaaah, Kansas City here I come
They got some crazy little women there
And I'm gonna get me one
(One more time)

If I don't leave that woman, know I'm gonna die
Got to find a brand new baby and that's the reason why:
Ya, ya ya-eeeee eee, Kansas City here I come
They got some crazy little women there
And I'm gonna get me one
Yeah, yeah
They got some crazy little women there
And I'm gonna get me one
(One more time)

They got some crazy little women there
And I'm gonna get me one
