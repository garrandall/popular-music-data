Uh, yeah, come inside
Now turn the lights down
Don't be scared, touch me
I know what you want and all
Tonight is your night
For the rest of your life
So just lay back and relax and listen


There's somethin' in your eyes, baby
It's tellin' me you want me, baby
Tonight is your night
See, you don't have to ask for nothin'
I'll give you everything you need
So girl, don't be shy, oh, just...


(Baby, come inside) Oh, turn down the lights
'Cause there is something that I want from you right now

‘Cause I've got all the answers, girl
To the questions in your head
And I'm gonna be right there for you, baby, hey..


(Baby, come inside) Girl, why don't you turn down the lights
'Cause there is something that I want from you right now, hey

You're so sweet, yeah
And your body's like a lemon drop
Sure taste good to me
So let's lay down
And get close 'til we become one
And I promise you, baby
