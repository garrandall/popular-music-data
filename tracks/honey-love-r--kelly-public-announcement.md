How come we don't slow dance no more 
How come we don't hold each other real close 
Stick together close like hand and glove 
The way we used to off honey love 

Hold 'em up, what the deal, bring it back 
Days of grind, holdin girls, bendin back 
Ghetto style of romance, keep it hot 
In the basement of your best friend spot 
Everybody from the hood, ain't no game 
Freakin out in the sweat, ain't no shame 
In you know what I feel, what I speak 
It went down at the end every week 
Let's bring it back 


How come we don't slow dance no more 
How come we don't hold each other real close 
Stick together close like hand and glove 
The way we used to off honey love 

The basement parties used to be so tight 
Bumpin, grindin, freakin with you all night 
Off up in the corner shorty got me gone 
Pressed all up against me shorty got me swoll 

Listen up as I begin to break it down 
Yyou so call playas at the party jumpin round 
Rap music was kept on the low 
Cause anybody that got lucky 
Got it dancing slow 
I'm not sayin that what you do ain't cool 
You do it so much you forgot about the old school 
Ghetto lights and one turntable was the move 
And the only thing we came there to do and that's to slow dance 



H-Town had everybody knockin boots 
R Kelly, PA honey lovin you 
Freak me baby, lights out like Silk used to do 
Do me baby in the corner just me and you 
Isley Brothers put us in the bed between the sheets 
For some sexual healin, for some sexual healin 
Keith Sweat talking bout how deep your loving go 
Luther Vandross put us in the mood for some... ooh yeah
