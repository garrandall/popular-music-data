Spoken:
"The next flight to London will be boarding
In five minutes"

Next plane to London
Leavin' on runway number five
Next plane to London
And I'm missin' him,
That baby
Of mine.

Told 'I'm I was gonna be a star
But to do it I would have to go far away
But I'd come back someday
And take him away
I'm on the

Next plane to London
Leavin' on runway number five
Next plane to London
And I'm missin' him,
That baby
Of mine.

Said that over here I wasn't in.
Down in Hollyword I couldn't find a friend
Would would help me get in
Or listen to me
I'm on the

Next plane to London
Leavin' on runway number five
Next plane to London
And I'm missin' him,
That baby
Of mine.

Spoken:
"Your attention please. The next flight to London
Is now in the final boarding stafe.
All passengers holding tickets please proceed to
The boarding area number five."

Maybe over there I'll get a start
Only hope by leavin' I don't break his heart,
The more important part
Than any record on the chart
I'm on the

Next plane to London
Leavin' on runway number five
Next plane to London
And I'm missin' him,
That baby
Of mine.

Next plane to London
Leavin' on runway number five.
Next plane to London
And I'm missin' him more and more
That baby of mine.
