Drip, drip, drippity drop
Drip, drip, drippity drop

The roof is leaking
And the rain's falling on my head
Drip, drip drippity drop

Well, the roof is leaking
And the rain's falling on my head
Drip, drip drippity drop

I cried so hard teardrops soiled my face
Drip, drip drippity drop

Well, she packed up her clothes
And she moved out on the midnight train
Drip, drip drippity drop

Well, she packed up her clothes
And she moved out on the midnight train
Drip, drip drippity drop

You know, this empty room
Is driving me insane
Flip, flip flippity flop

Well, I'm sitting here drinking
Thinking what I'm gonna do
Sip, sip sippity sop

Well, I'm sitting here drinking
Thinking what I'm gonna do
Sip, sip sippity sop

You know the roof is leaking
And the rain is falling through
Drip, drip drippity drop

Well, I ran into my buddy
He gave me a tip, tip, tip
He said, "Your woman's gone and left"
I said, "I'm hip, hip, hip"

I said, "Just mind your own affairs
And bite your lip, lip, lip
I don't need you to tell me
She gave me the slip, slip, slip"

Because the roof is leaking
And the rain's falling in my head
Drip, drip drippity drop

I cried so hard
Teardrops soiled my face
Drip, drip drippity drop

Woah, oh
Drip, drip drippity drop
Woah, oh
Drip, drip drippity drop
Woah, oh
Drip, drip
