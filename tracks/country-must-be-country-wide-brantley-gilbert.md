I grew up south of the Mason Dixon
Workin' spittin' huntin' and fishin'
Stone cold country by the grace of God

I was gasin' up the other day
And an ol' boy pulled up with a license plate
From Ohio I thought oh good lord he's lost 
From his wranglers to his boots
He reminded me of Chris LeDoux
And that Copenhagen smile

Country must be country wide
In every state
There's a station
Playin' Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives

There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide

It ain't where
It's how you live
We weren't raised to take
We were raised to give
The shirt off our back
To anyone in need

We bow our heads before we eat
Before we start our day
Before we fall asleep
'Cause in God we trust and we believe
And we see what's wrong
And we know what's right

And ol' Hank he said it all
When he said country folks can survive

In every state
There's a station
Playin' Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives

There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide

In every state
There's a station
Playin' Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives

There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide

There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide
