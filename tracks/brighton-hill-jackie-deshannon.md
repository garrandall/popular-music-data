Brighton Hill, where the sky changes its color
Hopes are high, there's no other place I'd rather be
Find your dream by a tree out in the meadow
Where the flowers are yellow
Life is what it seems

Brighton Hill is a feelin' within me
Anybody goin' that way?
Brighton Hill is my friend and will be
'Til my dyin' day, hey baby now
'Til my dyin' day

But I got a lot of livin' to do
I got a lot of livin' to do

Brighton Hill with its green fields of clover
That's where kindness rains over everything around
And livin' good on a bicycle Sunday
You can have such a fun day
Up on Brighton Hill

Brighton Hill is a feelin' within me
Anybody goin' that way?
Now, Brighton Hill is my friend and will be
'Til my dying day
People now, anybody goin' that way?
Brighton Hill, a feelin' within me
Anybody goin' that way?
Brighton Hill
