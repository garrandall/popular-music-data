Baby loves me, yes, yes she does
Ah, the girl's outta sight, yeah
Says she loves me, yes, yes she does
Mmm, gonna show me tonight, yeah

Hey, she got the way to move me
Cherry
(She got the way to groove me)
(She got the way to groove me)
Cherry, baby
She got the way to move me
(She got the way to groove me)
All right

Tell your mama, girl, I can't stay long
We got things we gotta catch up on
Mmm, you know
You know what I'm sayin'
Can't stand still while the music is playin'
All right

Y'ain't got no right, no, no you don't
Ah, to be so exciting
Won't need bright lights, no, no we won't
Gonna make our own lightning

Hey, she got the way to move me
Cherry
(She got the way to groove me)
Cherry, baby
She got the way to move me
(She got the way to groove me)

No, we won't tell a soul where we gone to
Girl, we do whatever we want to
Ah, I love the way that you do me
Cherry, babe, you really get to me

Hey, she got the way to move me
Cherry
(She got the way to groove me)
Cherry, baby
She got the way to move me
(She got the way to groove me)
Cherry....
She got the way to move me
(She got the way to groove me)
Cherry....
(She got the way to groove me)
