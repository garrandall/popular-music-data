(Dip dip sip sha da da)
Sounds in the distance cry
(Dip dip sip sha da da)
Linger then pass you by
(Sha da da) I know that
(Sha da da) there is no
Other time like Night time

When your hold your baby close
(Night time) that's the time
You dream the most
(Night time) it's a time
For lovers to play

(Night time)
There's a picture in the sky
(Night time)
Of a million stars on high
(Night time) and the moon
It doesn't seen so far away

(Dip dip sip sha da da)
Sounds in the distance cry
(Dip dip sip sha da da)
Linger then pass you by
(Sha da da) I know that
(Sha da da) there is no
Other time like

Night time
Silhouettes come into view
(Night time) as you
Whisper I love you
(Night time) and stardust
Sprinkles you from up above

(Night time) As you
Run to hidden places
(Night time) To be
Lost in her embraces
(Night time) at the end of Day
