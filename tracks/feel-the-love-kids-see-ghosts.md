I can still feel the love
I can still feel the love
I can still feel the love
Feel the love


We not worried 'bout no other niggas, we them other niggas
You bust down a Rollie, I bust down a brick, then I flood it, nigga
I am not to be compared to you rappers, Eazy-Duz-It, nigga
I am more Eazy, you tryin’ your best to become me, nigga
She like them bottles with bubbles in it
Buy her Loewe and other linen
Why would I wait when there's other women?
Why would I hate? We in love with winnin' (Oh!)
Buy her bundles, fly her out, bring her friend, I try her out
Ain’t no worries findin' out, the details is ironed out
Easily they plays along, hopin' that I play a song
Love to fuck to trap music (Feel the love)
Grrrat-gat-gat-gat-gat
Dope money just came along (Woo)


Grrrat-gat (I can still feel the love)
Gat-gat, gat, ga-ga-ga-ga-gat
Grrrat, gat-gat-gat (I can still feel the love)
Gat-gat-gat-gat-gat-gat-gat, grrrat
Gat-gat-gat-gat (Feel the love)
Ga-ga-gat, ga-gat, ga-gat, ga-gat-gat, grrrat-gat


Ba-ba-ba-ba
Brrrat-dat-da-da-da, da
Ga-ga-ga-ga
Brrr-ah-da-da-da, brrr-ah-da-da-da
Brrr-ah-da-da-da, brrr-ah-da-da-da
Brrr-ah-rrr-ah, brrr-ah-gat-gat-ga
Rude-rude-rude-rude-woo!


Where the chorus?


I can still feel the love
I can still feel the love
I can still feel the love
Feel the love
