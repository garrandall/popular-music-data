Jimmy James & The Vagabonds

Come To Me Softly

Come to me softly
While stars sleep above
Walk with me quietly
Then whisper your love

Cause that's when I'll tell you
How much I love you, alright
With not only my lips
Oh no no no no no no no no, baby
Alright, but with all of my heart

Kiss my lips gently
Our passion is ever so new
Let my heart slowly
Awaken to you

Cause that's when I'm gonna tell you
How much I love you, baby
With not only my lips
Oh my my baby, oh my baby
But with all of my heart

Stay always beside me
Through each passing year
Let your precious love
Softly guide us, my dear

Cause that's when I'll tell you
How much I love you
With all of my heart

...

(Fade)
