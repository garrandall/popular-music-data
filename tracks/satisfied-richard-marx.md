We work our bodies weary to stay alive
There must be more to livin' than nine to five

Why should we wait for some better time
There may not even be a tomorrow
Ain't no sense in losing your mind
I'm gonna make it worth the ride


Don't you know, I won't give up until
I'm satisfied
Don't you know, why should I stop until
I'm satisfied

Ignore the hesitation, that ties your hands
Use your imagination, and take a chance

I won't let my moment of thuth pass me by
I've gotta make my move now or never
And if they turn mr loose on this town
They're gonna have to hold me down



Oh, don't you know, ain't gonna stop until
Were satisfied
Don't you know, we shouldn't stop until
We're satisfied

Don't you know, ain't gonna stop until
I'm satisfied
Don't you know, we won't give up until
We're satisfied
