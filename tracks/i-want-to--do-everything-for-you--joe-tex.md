I want to hold you in my arms
Till you say turn you lose
I want to do little things for you
Till you say it ain't no use

I want to wake you every morning
With a good morning kiss
I want to kiss you to sleep the same way
'Cause I know you like this

I want to do everything for you
'Cause that's all that man can do
When he loves a woman like I love you
And I love ya (love ya)
Love ya (love ya)
Love ya (love ya)
Ooh ee, I love you

I want to say sweet things to you
Till you say I said enough
I want to stand right by your side
When the goin' gets tough

I want to mend your broken heart
Till you say the hurt is gone
I want to stay with you always
So that you won't be alone

I want to do everything for you
'Cause that's all that man can do
When he loves a woman like I love you
And I love ya (love ya)
Love ya (love ya)
Love ya (love ya)
Ooh ee, I love you

I want to work for you every day
Till you say come home and rest
I want to buy you pretty things
So you can look your best

I want to take you everywhere
So the world can see what I got
I want to treat you with tender love
Till you say I've got to stop

I want to do everything for you
'Cause that's all that man can do
When he loves a woman like I love you
And I love ya (love ya)
Love ya (love ya)
I love you (love ya)
Oh, I love you (love ya)
I love you (love ya)
I love ya (love ya)
Haha (love ya)
Yes (love ya)
