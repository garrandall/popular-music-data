Tonight I'm yours
And you are mine, now
But is it love
Or just summertime, now?
Oh, the time is right
Come hold me tight
Let's grab onto the love that we can borrow
And let's not hang each other up
With words that we'll forget about tomorrow
'Cause the things we write in the summer sand
The "I love you"'s and the future plans
Disappear, slip right through your hand
Like this warm, soft bed of summer sand
You got someone
And so do I, now
Our hearts are locked in
So why should we lie, now?
Bathe with me in harmony
Let's sing our summer song and sing it sweetly
For we can't stop the autumn wind that blows away
The summer sand completely
Yes, the things we write in the summer sand
The "I love you"'s and the future plans
Disappear, slip right through your hand
Like this warm, soft bed of summer sand
Oh, the time is right
Come hold me tight
Let's grab onto the love that we can borrow
And let's not hang each other up
With words that we'll forget about tomorrow
'Cause the things we write in the summer sands
The "I love you"'s and the future plans
Disappear, slip right through your hand
Like this warm, soft bed of summer sand
Things we write in the summer sands
The "I love you"'s and the future plans
Disappear, slip right through your hand
Like this warm, soft bed of summer sand
