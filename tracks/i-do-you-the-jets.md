No one ever told me
A heart could ache as bad as mine
Boy, gotta tell ya
I thought that it would take my time

I thank you for the care
Now I know you're there for me
I tell you what I've found
Now you've come around for me


Hey, if anybody loves you
Oh, baby
I do you

If anybody loves you
Oh, baby
I do you


I may be sentimental
To fall for you again this way
But maybe you know better and
This time you're gonna stay

I thank you for the care
Now I know you're there for me, yeah
I tell you what I've found
Now you've come around for me




My heart
Take my heart from nothing
Turn it into something
You know I love you

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

I thank you for the care
Now I know you're there for me
I tell you what I've found
Now you've come around for me



Hey
Anybody loves you
Anybody loves you
Oh, baby
