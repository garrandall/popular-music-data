Mama told me not to waste my life (Ah-oh
She said "Spread your wings my little butterfly (Ah-oh
Don't let what they say keep you up at night (Ah-oh
And if they give youâ€”, shh, then they can walk on by-y-y


My feet, feet can't touch the ground
And I can't hear a sound
But you just keep on running up your mouth, yeah
Walk, walk on over there
'Cause I'm too fly to care, oh, yeah


Your words don't mean a thing, I'm not listening
Keep talking, all I know is


Mama told me not to waste my life
She said "Spread your wings my little butterfly"
Don't let what they say keep you up at night
And they can't detain you cause wings are made to fly
And we don't let nobody bring us down
No matter what you say, it won't hurt me
Don't matter if I fall from the sky
These wings are made to fly


I'm, firing up on that runway
I know we're gonna get there someday
But we don't need no ready steady go, no
Talk, talk turns into air
And I don't even care, oh yeah


Your words don't mean a thing, I'm not listening
Keep talking, all I know is


Mama told me not to waste my life
She said "Spread your wings my little butterfly"
Don't let what they say keep you up at night
And they can't detain you cause wings are made to fly
And we don't let nobody bring us down
No matter what you say, it won't hurt me
Don't matter if I fall from the sky
These wings are made to fly


I don't need no one saying, "Hey, hey, hey, hey"
I don't hear no one saying, "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey"
You better keep on walking, I don't wanna hear your talking, boy
You better keep on walking, I don't wanna hear your talking, boy


Your words don't mean a thing, I'm not listening
They're just like water off my wings


Mama told me not to waste my life (Oh woah)
She said "Spread your wings my little butterfly" (My little butterfly)
Don't let what they say keep you up at night
And they can't detain you (They can't detain you-oh
'Cause wings are made to fly
And we don't let nobody bring us down
No matter what you say, it won't hurt me (Oh, whoah)
Don't matter if I fall from the sky (Oh, whoah)
These wings are made to fly


And we don't let nobody bring us down
No matter what you say, it won't hurt me
Don't matter if I fall from the sky
These wings are made to fly
