I love you and don't you forget it
I love you and don't you forget it
I love you and don't you forget it, baby!

Love me too and you won't regret it
Love me too and you won't regret it
Love me too and you won't regret it, baby!

I love you and don't you forget it
I love you and don't you forget it
I love you and don't you forget it, baby!

I love you and don't you forget it
That makes seven times that I've said it
I don't see how you can forget it now!

I love you in the springtime
I love you in the fall
I love you at a party
We always have a ball!

And when you're in my arms dear
I love you most of all
In the morning and in the evening
An' when it's cloudy or clear
I'm in love with you, so in love with you
Every day of the year!

I love you and don't you forget it
I love you and don't you forget it
I love you and nun't you forget it, baby!

Love me too and you won't regret it
Love me too and you won't regret it
Love me too and you won't regret it, baby!

I love you and don't you forget it
I love you and don't you forget it
I love you and don't you forget it, baby!

I love you and don't you forget it
That makes twenty times that I've said it
I don't see how you can forget it now!



I love you and don't you forget it
There, that's one more time that I've said it
I don't see how you can forget it now!
