Mercy
Have a little mercy for me

Trapped in a feeling, hooked on a soulful love
Baby, I'm weak for ya
I'm a victim of your moody love
Sometimes I know you really love me
Then again, I wonder if you do
To make, to make you mine completely
Just yesterday, you said we were through

Loving you is like sittin' on a time bomb
Waitin' for the hurt to come, oh
Loving you is like sittin' on a time bomb
Waitin' for the hurt to come, oh yeah

Bewildered, yes I'll live
You keep me so confused
It's like holding a stick of dynamite
Watching the burning fuse (It's like a time bomb)
You keep me waiting (Keep me waiting), anticipating (Anticipating)
Is the worst yet to come (Am I the only one?)
Baby, have a little mercy for me (Mercy)
I'm chained to your love, how can I run

Loving you is like sittin' on a time bomb
Waitin' for the hurt to come, oh
Don't you know it's like sittin' on a time bomb
Waitin' for the hurt to come, oh yeah, oh yeah
Ow!

Mercy (Mercy)
Have a little mercy for me (Have a little mercy for me)
Will you love me like you oughta? (Ooh, ooh)
I get a feeling that the fuse is getting shorter

Loving you is like sittin' on a time bomb
Waitin' for the hurt to come, oh, I can't help myself
I'm just sittin' on a time bomb waitin' for the hurt to come
I don't want nobody else
I'm just sittin' on a time bomb waitin' for the hurt to come...
