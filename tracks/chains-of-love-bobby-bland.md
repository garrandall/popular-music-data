Chains of love
Tied my heart to you
Chains of love
Made me feel so blue

Now I'm your prisoner
And tell me
What are you going to do

Well, if you're gonna leave me
Please won't you set me free
And, oh, if you're gonna leave me
Please set me free

You know I can't stay here
With these chains, oh, unless
You stay on here with me

Well, it's three o'clock
In the morning, baby
Lord, and the moon
Is shining bright

And, oh, it's three o'clock
In the morning, baby
And let me tell you
The moon is shining bright

And, oh, I was just
Sitting here wondering
Lord, where can you be tonight
Lord, yeah

Chains of love
