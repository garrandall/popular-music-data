You were mine for just a while
Now you're putting on the style
And you've never once looked back
At your home across the track

You're the gossip of the town
But my heart can still be found
Where you tossed it to the ground
Pick me up on your way down

Pick me up on your way down
When you're blue and all alone
When their glamour starts to bore you
Come on back where you belong

You may be their pride and joy
But they'll find another toy
Then they'll take away your crown
Pick me up on your way down

They have changed your attitude
Made you haughty and so rude
Your new friends can take the blame
Underneath you're still the same

When you learn these things are true
I'll be waiting here for you
As you tumble to the ground
Pick me up on your way down

Pick me up on your way down
When you're blue and all alone
When their glamour starts to bore you
Come on back where you belong

You may be their pride and joy
But they'll find another toy
Then they'll take away your crown
Pick me up on your way down
