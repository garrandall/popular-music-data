Look
I want all the smoke motherfucker
I want all the smoke
Yeah


As I said, you’re provocative
You was talking shit
And I’m kinda pissed
Lil awkward diss you came with
I cauterize you with the flame quick
Cause I ain’t authorize you to say shit
Them awful rhymes you just pasted
After you copied, your attitude washy
Who the fuck is this rapper dude Bobby?
Bitch look you made a mistake for real
This ain’t a blunt but you’re facing Ls
I hate to tell you, you ain’t got a chance
You’re like 40, still not a man
Who’s this stupid lil bozo?
Man this fool got no flow
I’m not a fan of the rhythm, I eat this fool
Like a sandwich for dinner
This cannibalism, this man is my victim
He’s lacking precision
Watch him get to vanishing quicker
I chop em up like animal liver
Even with sandals I’ll kick you
Need some bandage and stitches
I’m about to have Campbell’s for dinner
Burn my mouth on soup? You ain’t even heard the song I was spoofin’
You smoke trees? I bet all along you’ve been boofin’
Beat me with the bat quick? Nah I’ll hit you with the batman
Gotham style
Yeah cause you’re a fucking joker you moronic clown
Tryna call me out just quiet down
Maybe we can find some common ground
We both rap, but you’re seriously awful pal
Dissing me over a can of soup
Nah damn it dude, what advantage do you have?
That recording was weak, weak as fuck, what mic did you use?
Apple headphones? Yet you claim you freestyled in the booth
I’ll introduce my little truth, you better with comply with the rules
Or I’ll display your head over the fire like a moose
Dragon’s breath? Well bitch I’m a dragon slayer
You look like a washed out chronic masturbator
Thinking you Blaine? You ain’t magic David
All you are is a half assed complacent
Rapper wannabe
Gayhound, huh? Guess you’re full of homophobia
Put this chrome to your dome I’m smoking ya
Bitch dissing young rappers, you’re grown how old are ya?
You’d be better off drinking a cup full of ammonia
Dispatch my diss track on your bitch ass
Can’t withstand the whiplash from my sick raps
It didn’t take me a month to drop, but regardless of this shit
It’s quality over quickness, it’s honestly ridiculous
Like you recorded a wack song and didn’t mix it
Listen, stop with dissin'
Don’t copy my rhythm
I jot with precision
Why the hell you hatin? On my generation?
Cause you live with your mom, stayed in her basement and just never made it
You’re irrelevant nameless, step into danger
A pessimist wasted
This my detrimental creation
Better get him away to
A medical station
What you think I spit slow, I can read cursive fast
And observing facts, this kid’s dyslexic
I murder this fuck in a millisecond
Don’t care where he goes, if it’s hell or heaven
You wanna win? You gonna have to talk even louder
You suck, change my mind like Steven Crowder
You’re scared as fuck and I feast on cowards
You really stink, probably need to shower
I spit that venom, cause I’m symbiotic
Gayhound? You’re the only one in the closet
With your limbs tied and mouth duct taped
For fucks sake, hope you get butt raped
You thought my last track was too long, I’ve shortened it?
That doesn’t mean I didn’t take you to the morgue again
I took this beat and I beat you blue prick
I eat you stupid, I need to do it
This pussy just got raped
Tell him join the me too movement


Pussy die
Look alive
Hit you when I’m cookin rhymes
Crooked spine
I push aside
Wack motherfucker die
Yeah
This my freestyle, meanwhile
I'm that evil child
Fuck this Bobby clown, probably thinks that he's like Bobby Brown but
