There's something happening here
But what it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
A telling me, I got to beware


I think it's time we stop(stop)
Children, what's that sound?(what’s that sound?)
Everybody look what's going down(Everybody look what’s going down)


There's battle lines being drawn
And nobody's right, if everybody's wrong
Young people speaking their minds
Are gettin’ so much resistance from behind(from behind)


It's time we stop(stop)
Hey, what's that sound?(what’s that sound?)
Everybody look what's going down(Everybody look what’s going down)


What a field day for the heat(Ooo-oo-oo)
A thousand people in the street (Ooo-oo-oo)
Singing songs and a carryin’ signs (Ooo-oo-oo)
Mostly say, "hooray for our side" (Ooo-oo-oo)


It's time we stopped(stopped)
Hey, what's that sound?(what’s that sound?)
Everybody look what's going down(Everybody look what’s going down)


Paranoia strikes deep(paranoia strikes deep)
Into your life it will creep(into your life it will creep)
It starts when you're always afraid(it starts when you’re always afraid)
Step out of line, the man come and take you away(step out of line, the man come and take you away)


We better stop(stop)
Hey, what's that sound?(what’s that sound?)
Everybody look what's going(Everybody look what’s going down)


We better stop(stop)
Hey, what's that sound?(what’s that sound?)
Everybody look what's going(Everybody look what’s going down)


We better stop(stop)
Now, what's that sound?(what’s that sound?)
Everybody look what's going(everybody look what’s going)


We better stop(stop)
Children, what's that sound?(what’s that sound?)
Everybody look what's going down... (everybody look...
