We wanted to know if we were in love
So we asked the wisest man in town
We wanted to know if we were in love
And this is what he said

You wanna know when you're in love
That's a question that's as old as time
You wanna know when you're in love
You can tell it in these elementary signs

By the light in your eyes
The beating of your heart
And the rhythm
It puts in your feet

You get up and glow
Let the whole world know
That you're radiating
What a heat

Happiness is in store
So open up the door
Times a-wasting, boy
Get off the line

Jump over, jump over
Jump for joy
You've a love to last
A whole lifetime

Jump over (over)
Jump over (over)
Oh, jump over

You lucky girl (you lucky girl)
You lucky boy (you lucky boy)
Meant for one another
Heaven knows

You lucky girl (you lucky girl)
You lucky boy (you lucky boy)
You're in love because
It plainly shows

By the light in your eyes
The beating of your heart
And the rhythm
It puts in your feet

You get up and glow
Let the whole world know
That you're radiating
What a heat

Happiness is in store
So open up the door
Times a-wasting, boy
Get off the line

Jump over, jump over
Jump for joy
You've a love to last
A whole lifetime

Jump over (over)
Jump over (over)
Oh, jump over

Jump over (over)
Jump over (over)
Oh, jump over
