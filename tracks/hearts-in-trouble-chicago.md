Nothing's gonna turn your head
You wouldn't let it
Nothing's gonna change your mind

You just wanna get ahead
And you can't forget it
Leaving all the best behind

Never know what you got
'Til it's moved down the line
Take a look at yourself in the mirror
You'll find, you'll find

(Hearts in trouble)
It's hard to tell
When you're losing touch
You can't find love
When you got so much
(Hearts in trouble)
Don't you know that
I'll be there for you

Turn around and see
What love can do for you

Something getting in your way
You can't shake it
It's never gonna let you go, oh

Running from your yesterday
You won't make it
If you never let it go

All the things that you need
You've been leaving behind
Soon your heart's gonna bleed
You've been losing your mind
You can't hide

(Hearts in trouble)
It's hard to tell
When you're losing touch
You can't find love
When you got so much
(Hearts in trouble)
Don't you know that
I'll be there for you

Turn around and see
What love can do for you

Never know what you got
'Til it's moved down the line
Take a look at yourself in the mirror
You'll find, you'll find

(Hearts in trouble)
It's hard to tell
When you're losing touch
You can't find love
When you got so much
(Hearts in trouble)
Don't you know that
I'll be there for you

Turn around and see
What love can do

(Hearts in trouble)
It's hard to tell
When you're losing touch
You can't find love
When you got so much
(Hearts in trouble)
Don't you know that
I'll be there for you

Turn around and see
What love can do

Something gonna turn your head
You're gonna get it
Something gonna change your mind
