My God is awesome
He can move mountains
Keep me in the valley
Hide me from the rain
My God is awesome
Heals me when I'm broken
Strength where I've been weakened
Forever he will reign

My God is awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome...

My God is awesome
He can move mountains
Keep me in the valley
Hide me from the rain
My God is awesome
Heals me when I'm broken
Strength where I've been weakened
Ever he will reign

My God is awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome...

My God is awesome
Savior of the whole world
Giver of salvation
By his stripes I am healed
My God is awesome
Today I am forgiven
His grace is why I'm living
Praise His holy name

My God is awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome...

Our God is awesome the world is full of iconic figures,
The people praise them they stack us up in a high percentage, the Giants in our eyes
The sky's the limit the picture painted is larger than life but God is bigger
Yeah God is greater I weighed him on a scale like Crocs and Gators found out only God can save us
And God is gracious that's who we flock too in a day of trouble and when we blow it like hot food
This song's official nobody's greater VaShawn Mitchell
You cut it right but that song it echoes the heart of Scripture
Yeah they wonder why we so serious it's cause Jesus Christ is awesome and imperial

Okay my Jesus the Son Christ the King of Kings and he's got on earth
My messiah born and raised to give us all a second birth
And from heaven he came down to free all that were bound
Oh God the four and twenty fell down casting down their Crowns

Saying thou art worthy Lord to receive glory, honor, and power
So every man, woman, boy, and girl let's make this declaration around the world

He's mighty 
Awesome 
He's holy 
Awesome 
He's great 
Awesome 
Deliverer 
Awesome 
Provider 
Awesome 
Protector 
Awesome 

My God is awesome
He can move mountains
Keep me in the valley
Hide me from the rain
My God is awesome
Heals me when I'm broken
Strength where I've been weakened
Praise His holy name
