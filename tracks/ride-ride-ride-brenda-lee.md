(One more ride, one more time)
 I vowed that yesterday would never
Find its way into my life again.
I said I'd only look ahead.
Never where I'd been
But sometimes promises get broken
When you least expect them too.
That's the way it was today

When I say you, cause seeing you again,
Woke up all those sleeping feelings.
I was fine till then,
Now I'm jelly all inside.
I had all those old memories neatly tucked away
In some dusty corner of my mine
But seeing you again
Took me back for one more ride,
One more time

 the past did not exist,
I'd crossed it off my list
At least a hundred times.
It was dead and gone until you came along
And erased the lines.
Now things are right back where they ended
And there's nothing more except

To try to close the door on times we knew.
Cause seeing you again,
Woke up all those sleeping feelings.
I was fine till then,
Now I'm jelly all inside
I had all those old feelings neatly tucked away
In some old dusty corner of my mind
But, seeing you again
Took me back for one more ride
(One more ride)
One more ride- one more ride
