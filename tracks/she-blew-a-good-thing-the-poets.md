She blew a good thing
She blew a good thing
Now if a little girl there should doubt me
Tell her I'm gonna wait

And if she asks ya why
Tell her that I
Left her 'cause she didn't realize
That she coulda had a love
Hotter than fire, oh yeah

She coulda had a heart
Beating with desire
She coulda had a love
Hotter than fire...
A heart
Beating with desire

She blew a good thing
She blew a good thing
(She blew a good thing)
(She blew a good thing)

She coulda had arms
Holding her tight, oh yeah
She coulda had lips
Kissin' her nightly

She coulda had arms
Holding her tight
And lips
Kissin' her nightly

Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

She blew a good thing
She blew a good thing
(She blew a good thing)
(She blew a good thing)

She coulda had me
Dangling on a string
She coulda had me
Buying her a ring
Oh yeah

She coulda had me
Dangling on a string
I woulda went to a jeweler
And bought her a ring

She blew a good thing
She blew a good thing
(She blew a good thing)
(She blew a good thing)

She blew a good thing
(She blew a good thing)
I woulda held her tightly
(She blew a good thing)
I woulda kissed her nightly
(She blew a good thing)

She blew a good thing
(She blew a good thing)
She blew a good thing
(She blew a good thing)

She coulda had me dangling on a string
