Woo
Ah
Oh oh oh oh
Ha ha, uh
Woo
So many ways I can love you right (Oh oh oh oh)
It's going down, y'all
It's going down like this

You don't know just what I'd do for you
Love you tender, love you oh so good
I can't wait to get to it babe
I wanna do it, baby
Show you what I'm all about, yeah

I turn on some music
And dim the lights (come on)
Say everything you like to hear
And do what you like (ha ha)
Do all the things
You don't expect me to do (uh)
You can see how many ways
I can love you
Let me count the ways

In so many ways I can love you (check it out, y'all, oh)
In so many ways (oh oh oh oh)
In so many ways I can blow your mind
I can blow your mind
In so many ways I can love you (yeah)
I can love you right (oh oh oh oh)
In so many ways
Show you a real good time (it's going down)
Count the ways

I need somebody
I'll take to any extreme
To show you just what I mean (say what, ha ha)
I doubt if you have ever been
With someone like me (ha ha)
'Cause all I want to do is make you happy

I turn on some music (come on)
And dim the lights
Say everything you like to hear
And do what you like
Do all the things
You don't expect me to do
You can see how many ways
I can love you (shh)
Let me count the ways

In so many ways I can love you (hey)
So many ways I can love you (oh oh oh oh)
In so many ways I can blow your mind
I can blow your mind (sh, sh)
In so many ways I can love you (shh, oh)
I can love you (oh oh oh oh)
In so many ways (all right)
Show you a real good time (woo)
Count the ways (let me count the ways)

In so many ways I can love you (oh oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh
In so many ways I can blow your mind (shh, yeah)
I can blow your mind
In so many ways I can love you (need a way)
Oh, I can love you right (oh oh oh oh)
In so many ways
Show you a real good time (show you a real good time, it's going down)
Count the ways (let me count the ways)

I turn on some music
And dim the lights
Say everything you like to hear
And do what you like (shh)
Do all the things
You don't expect me to do
You can see how many ways
I can love you
Let me count the ways

In so many ways I can love you (yeah, come on, oh, so many ways)
Oh oh oh oh
In so many ways I can blow your mind
I can blow your mind
In so many ways I can love you (ah)
Oh, so many ways (oh oh oh oh)
In so many ways
Show you a real good time (show you a real good time)
Count the ways (let me count the ways)

It's going down
Oh oh oh oh
Woo
Check it out, y'all
Oh oh oh oh
Uh, ah
Count the ways (ah)
