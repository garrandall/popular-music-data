Must have been heaven sent to me
Cause I never knew love like this
You know you make me feel
So good inside and boy,
It's a feeling I just can't hide
And baby words can't express my gratitude
For each and every little thing you do
I want to understand
You're all the man
That I love and I know
That I need and I want and more
Baby let me count the ways

How many ways, I love you
Let me count the ways
How many ways, I love you
Let me cont the ways

You know you're so very special to me my baby
I'll never let you go
When I'm with you
I feel so free I could count
From 1 up to 99 and still believe
Although sometimes now baby
We disagree
There ain't never or will
ever be another love for me
And I want you to know I appreciate
All the things that you do when you do
What you do for me
Darling let me count the ways

How many ways, I love you
Let me count the ways
How many ways, I love you
Let me cont the ways

1, 2 I love you
3, 4 So much more
5, 6 I can't get enough of this
7 let me show you my love
And take you to heaven
8, 9, 10 let me start love
Over and over. . .again
