Oh!


Hey
There she go
Thatâs the one Iâve got to know
Such a cutie right?
Her whole crew is tight
But they donât do it like you

How her hair flows when she walk
Like a Love Jones when she talk
Such a cutie right?
Her whole crew is tight
But they donât do it like you.


It seems like for a while Iâve know ya
Nostalgic moments feels like magic donât it
Girl you killin âem, my condolence
Thatâs how you on it? Yea thatâs how you on it

And Iâm gonna be with you no matter what it takes
Running with scissors in the traffic, tryna cut straight to the chase
Wanna be there when you wake
With no make up on your face
Not even gloss, before you brush
Love your dimples when you blush

Itâs the simple things in life we take for granted cause we rush
I just wanna gain your trust as well as me giving you mine
Whatâs yo sign? Iâm an Aries, Iâm a 90â²s baby clearly
Iâll make sure to make some time for you though my schedule may vary

Hold up, hold up, hold up
I just wanna know ya
I heard âem say that beautyâs in the eyes of the beholder
Well girl my visionâs bad so Iâmma need you to come closer
Closer, now you right here where you suppose to.


Oh!
Hey
There she go
Thatâs the one Iâve got to know
Such a cutie right?
Her whole crew is tight
But they donât do it like you

How her hair flows when she walk
Like a Love Jones when she talk
Such a cutie right?
Her whole crew is tight
But they donât do it like you.


Excuse me Misses, may I spark your interest
Cause you sure got my attention, I just wanna grant your wishes (la la)
What you want you get it, I donât call it tricking
Not just cause I got it cause I want to, that makes all the difference
Iâm about my business, and ooh girl you the business
We should get together soon so we can do some business
I got some things that I could teach ya, lemme show ya
Is you ready, whatâs the hold up

You ainât âbout no drama, you remind me of my mama
Smelling like flower balm and Escada
Shut it down and you donât even try ta
You such a boss but carry yourself like a lady
The baddest out ya crew and that is not up for debating

Wait
Hold up, hold up, hold up
I know what they say
Every rapper only want that sexual healing Marvin Gaye
Donât believe it girl, I promise Iâma treat you like my treasure
Iâm a movement by myself but I know youâll make me better.


Oh!
Hey
There she go
Thatâs the one Iâve got to know
Such a cutie right?
Her whole crew is tight
But they donât do it like you

How her hair flows when she walk
Like a Love Jones when she talk
Such a cutie right?
Her whole crew is tight
But they donât do it like you.


Oh!
Hey
There she go
Thatâs the one Iâve got to know
Such a cutie right?
Her whole crew is tight
But they donât do it like you

How her hair flows when she walk
Like a Love Jones when she talk
Such a cutie right?
Her whole crew is tight
But they donât do it like you.


Hey
Her hair flows when she walk
Like a Love Jones when she talk
Such a cutie right?
Her whole crew is tight
But they donât do it like you

They donât do it like you
The prettiest girl Iâve ever seen by the way
Yeah, yeah!
