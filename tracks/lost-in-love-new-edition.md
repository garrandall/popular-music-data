Would you love me
When nights are cold?
Would you love me
When I grow old?
Would you care
When living's not easy?
Take me by surprise
And say you're there

Would you love me?
Give me one more chance
Would you love me?
Try and understand
Would you share
A life that is music?
Show me in your eyes
That you'll stay with me tonight


(I'm lost in love) I can't live without you
(I'm lost in love) All my dreams around you
I'm lost in love
And it's true
I can't live without you
Oh, no


Would you love me
When I'm in doubt?
Would you love me
Just to be around?
Would you share
My life that is music
Take me in your arms
And sing my melody


(I'm lost in love) I can't live without you
(I'm lost in love) All my dreams around you
And I'm lost in love
And it's true
I can't live without you
Oh, no


(And I'm lost in love)
Say you really want me
Love is a passion
It just can't hide
(And I'm lost in love)
Time and again and it hurts me
You'll be my reason
For starting again, (again)


(I'm lost in love) I can't live without you
(I'm lost in love) And all my dreams around you
(I'm lost in love) I can't live without you
(I'm lost in love) Baby, baby, baby, baby
(I'm lost in love) Baby, I can't live without you
(I'm lost in love)
