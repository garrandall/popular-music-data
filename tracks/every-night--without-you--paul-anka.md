Every night I keep prayin' that you love me 
Every night I keep prayin' that you do-oo 
'cause I know that my life would be worthless 
Without you, (without you) without you (without you), without you 

Every night I keep prayin' that you want me 
Every night I keep prayin' that you do-oo 
'cause I know that my heart would be broken 
Without you, (without you) without you (without you), without you 

I couldn't bear to know you'd leave me 
No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no-no 
'cause I know that it would grieve me 
If you ever go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 

Every night I keep prayin' that you love me 
Every night it's the question that you don't or do 
So my love, let me know you really love, yes, you love me 
Or I'll be (or I'll be) eternally (eternally) without you 

Oh-oh-oh 
Oh-oh-oh 
Without you 
FADE
