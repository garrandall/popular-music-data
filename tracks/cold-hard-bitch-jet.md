Gotta leave town
Got another appointment
Spent all my rent
Girl you know I enjoyed it, yeah


Ain't gonna hang around 'til there's nobody dancing
I don't wanna hold hands and talk about our little plans, alright


Cold hard bitch
Just a kiss on the lips
And I was on my knees
I'm waiting, give me
Cold hard bitch
She was shakin' her hips
So that was all that I need


Gonna check her out
She's my latest attraction
Gonna hang around
Wanna get a reaction, yeah


Gonna take her home 'cause she's over romancing
Don't wanna hold hands and talk about our little plans, alright


Cold hard bitch
Just a kiss on the lips
And I was on my knees
I'm waiting, give me
Cold hard bitch
She was shakin' her hips
So that was all that I need
I'm waiting, give me
Cold hard bitch
Just a kiss on the lips
And I was on my knees


Yeah, I'm waiting
Yeah, I'm waiting
Yeah, I'm waiting
Yeah, I'm waiting
Yeah, yeah


Cold hard bitch
Just a kiss on the lips
And I was on my knees
I'm waiting, give me
Cold hard bitch
She was shakin' her hips
So that was all that I need
I'm waiting, give me
Cold hard bitch
Just a kiss on the lips
And I was on my knees
I'm waiting, give me
