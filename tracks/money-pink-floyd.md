Making the money to get by
Smoking the Pink Floyd every night
And I'm feeling sad 'cause everyday
I pay the price
Taking a walk to shake it off
I'm trying to believe in what I want
I don't what else I can say
I'm made this way

They say there's nothing to lose
But I lose it everyday
They say there's nothing to lose
But I lose it everyday

I'll find a place, I'll find a place
Somewhere special
I'll find a place, I'll find a place
Somewhere special

Mom and dad moved away from home
To Santa Clarita years ago
Just so that I could catch my dream
(I owe everything)
Honestly I could really cry
I hope that I looked back on their life
And see that I tried, I tried, I tried
(I tried, I tried, I tried)

They say there's nothing to lose
But I lose it everyday
They say there's nothing to lose
But I lose it everyday

I'll find a place, I'll find a place
Somewhere special
I'll find a place, I'll find a place
Somewhere special, special
I'll find a place somewhere special
I'll find a place, I'll find a place
Somewhere special
