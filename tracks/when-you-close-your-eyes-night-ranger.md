What do you do when it's falling apart
And you knew it was gone from the very start
Do you close your eyes and dream about me

A girl in love with a gleam in her eye
I was a younger boy all dressed in white
We're older now, Do you still think about me

I remember we learned about love in the back of a chevrolet
Well it felt so good to be young, feels like yesterday

When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
Do you still dream about me

I guess I don't know what I'm thinking
Coming off a hard night of drinking
Angie come closer to me, I need a soul to bleed on

It coulda been done in a different kinda way
But that ain't you, you play tough when you play
It's over now, I bet you still think about me

I remember I held you so tight
And we danced the night away
With the moves of two wide-eyed kids
I need you so much today

When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream about me

When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream about me

I remember we learned about love in the back of a chevrolet
No good for an old memory, to mean so much today

When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream about me

When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream about me

When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
When you go to sleep at night, do you dream about me
