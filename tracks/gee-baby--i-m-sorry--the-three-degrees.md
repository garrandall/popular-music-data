(Richard Barrett)

Gee, baby, I'm sorry
But this is goodbye
You know, I really hate to leave you
'Cause... 'cause you're such a nice guy

Gee, baby, I'm so sorry
(I'm so sorry, so sorry, so sorry)
But I found someone new
(Someone new, through with you, I'm so sorry)
And I know, I know that you're good for me
(Good, baby, good)
But I'm no good for you
Oh, oh oo-oh

Don't want to hurt you
I feel, I feel so ashamed
No words can tell you
How can I...
How can I...
How can I... explain

Gee, baby, I tried
I tried
Although you're sweet, you're not the guy
Gee, baby, I'm sorry
Please try to forget me

Gee, baby, I'm sorry
Gee, baby, I'm sorry
Gee, baby, I'm sorry
Gee, baby, I'm sorry
