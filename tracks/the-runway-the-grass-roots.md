I've been a brother to sorrow
I've been surrounded by gloom
'Cause this hotel's got hot & cold runnin'
Heartache in every room
Checkin' out of here in the mornin'
Even that will be too much time
I'm gonna get up on a big white bird
Waitin' after you with a line

Oh the runway is the one way to get back to you
Oh the runway is the one way to get back to you
If I have to beg, steal or borrow
I'll be seein' you, girl, tomorrow
Oh the runway is the one way to get back to you

TV's gonna get to me
Haven't heard a bit of good news
Who needs that when I'm sittin' here chewin'
I'm goin' struttin' in blues
I threw 'way to wake me at 7
Don't you wait a minute too long
I'm gonna leave with a one-way ticket
Goin' back to where I belong
