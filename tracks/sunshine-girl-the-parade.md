You're the sweetest thing I know
You dim the rainbow's glow
There's no power on this earth
To separate us, baby

'Cause you are my sunshine
And you are, you are, you are mine, all mine, yeah
(You are mine, all mine)

When it rained on my parade
You were there to lighten the way
You're rare as a rose in winter
You're more, more than I deserve

'Cause you, you are
(You are my sunshine)
You brighten up my darkest day yeah, you
(You are mine, all mine)
You're mine, all mine, all mine, all mine, all mine, all mine
Baby, it's you

Words like darling, sweetheart, forever
Girl it's you I'll always adore
They only say I love you
But you mean so much more

'Cause you are, you are, you are, you are
(You are my sunshine)
You're my sunshine, my sunshine

Baby, baby, you are, you're mine
(You are mine, all mine)
All mine, all mine, all mine, all mine

Hey you, you are
(You are my sunshine)
You're my sunshine, sunshine, sunshine

And you're everything to me, all my 
(You're mine, all mine)
I gotta love you sweety, honey, baby
(You are my sunshine)
You are, you are, you are

You're my sunshine, my sunshine, my sunshine
You are
(You are my sunshine)
You're mine
