This what happen when I think about you
I get in my feelings, yeah
I start reminiscing, yeah
Next time around, fuck I want it to be different, yeah
Waiting on a sign, guess it's time for a different prayer
Lord please save her for me, do this one favor for me
I had to change my player ways, got way too complicated for me
I hope she's waiting for me
Everywhere she go, they playin' my song
That's why I say the things that I say that way I know you can't ignore me
But so, so


So gimme all of you in exchange for me
Just give me all of you in exchange for me, for me

Break it down, yeah
Yes, sir, check

We use to lay up and then stay up
Have sex and then blow dank
I shouldn't have played no games with you, just levelled up my rank
Last time I saw you we ain't speak that was strange
Guess it's nothing I can do, man it's true, ex's change, yeah
Guess you changed for the better (better)
I know you know how to make me jealous
I was never loyal, let you tell it, yo
But I'm ready to fix it if you ready, baby
But so, so


So gimme all of you in exchange for me
Just give me all of you in exchange for me, for me

For real shawty
Yeah, I know

Yeah, is you at 2 Keys or Tin Roof?
Turn up with young Tiller, we just getting loose
Maybe, I'm lowkey feelin' you, don't be cynical
I'mma fuck you over, wanna fuck you over then again
The truth is I ain't really here to start problems
Girl, I swear to God them, hoes can't never say they got him
Know how bad you wanna tell 'em, "Don't try him."
I don't wanna tell him, let's surprise him
I don't wanna get into it, why you stressin' him, I've been drivin'
Back and forth, from Louisville to Lexington, mileage
On the whip, got your ass on my grip, college
Make you wanna strip for them dollars
Nah, girl, I got a job for you, swear to God I could do a lot for you
Saw you strollin' through the campus, I had to stop for you
I was scrollin' through the 'gram, girl, I had to follow you
Say what's up with you? You got my soul
