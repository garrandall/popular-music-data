You need a woman, need a woman tonight
You are looking to your left, you are looking to your right
You need a woman tonight, you need a lover so right
You need a woman tonight

I got this feeling, got this feeling inside
I'm not looking to run, I'm not looking to hide
You need a woman tonight, you need a lover so right
You need a woman tonight

Oh, it's on a lonely night
When a man needs a woman to love
And a woman to feel and a woman to hold tight

Oh, it's on a lonely night
No man can do it all alone
He needs to find a guiding light

And you know, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Takes two to tango, yeah
And you know, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
It takes two to tango

You need a woman, need a woman right now
I'm not telling no lies you need a lady and how
You need a woman tonight, you need a lover so right
You need a woman tonight

Oh, it's on a lonely night
When a man needs a woman to love
And a woman to feel and a woman to hold tight

Oh, it's on a lonely night
No man can do it all alone
He needs to find a guiding light

And you know, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Takes two to tango, whoa, yeah
And you know, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
It takes two to tango, yeah, yeah

You need a woman, need a woman tonight
You need a woman, need a woman tonight
You need a woman, need a woman tonight

You need a woman, need a woman tonight
You need a woman, need a woman tonight
You need a woman, need a woman tonight
