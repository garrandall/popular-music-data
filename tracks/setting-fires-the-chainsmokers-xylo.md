Down to my last match fire I'll touch just to feel
Why's it easier to burn than it is to heal?

Out in the cold you have been
I've begged you to come back in
But I can't do this again

I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

I can't
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

I've been looking for answers I don't want to hear
Chest to chest with you I'm staring into a mirror

Out in the cold you have been
I've begged you to come back in
But I can't do this again

I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

I can't
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

What would I do?
What I wouldn't do to save you
What would I do?
What I wouldn't do to save you

I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

I can't
I can't
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't
I can't
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
