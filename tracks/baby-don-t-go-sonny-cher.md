Baby don't go, pretty baby please don't go

I never had a mother, I hardly knew my dad
I've been in town for 18 years
You're the only boy I've had
I can't stay, maybe I'll be back some day

Baby don't go, pretty baby please don't go
I love you so, pretty baby please don't go

I never had no money, I bought at the second hand store
The way this old town laughs at me
I just can't take it no more
I can't stay, I'm gonna be a lady some day

Baby don't go, pretty baby please don't go
I love you so, pretty baby please don't go

When I get to the city, my tears will all be dry
My eyes will look so pretty
No one's gonna know I cried
Yes I'm goin' away, maybe I'll be back some day

Baby don't go, maybe I'll be back some day
