Don't even want the attention
But yeah, that's all that she's getting
Her song is on and she's spinning around, yeah
She got me drunk like Corona
Heart racing like it's Daytona
Oh, I'm in Heaven I swear right now

And those eyes can hypnotize
Was designed to blow my mind

Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

It's like I heard angels singing
Like she came down from the ceiling
When she walked in here this evening, I thought, yeah
That girl, one in seven billion
Got everyone in here feeling
Like there's a fire in this building, so hot

Got a smile on her angel face
I know I'll never lose my faith

Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

Got that look in her eyes
Swear she fell right out the sky
Yeah, I think I've seen the light
Every kiss, I could die
It's like the Heavens opened wide
Man, I swear I've seen the light, oh

Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

Oh, look what God
Look what God gave her
Oh, look what God gave her
