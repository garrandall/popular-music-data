In the night, in the city
Alone in my room, all alone
Touch me
Ooh, I get the feeling
Touch me
Ooh, it feels good
Touch me
Yeah, I get the feeling
Touch me good
Couldn't get to sleep
In my room last night
Something wasn't quite the same
Just as I was reaching
For the nearest light
I heard somebody calling my name
Touch me
Ooh, I get the feeling
Touch me
Ooh, it feels good
Touch me
Yeah, I get the feeling
Touch me good
(Touch me)
You've been away so long
(Touch me)
Oh, how I've missed you
(Touch me)
I need your soft touch
(Touch me)
Just let me kiss you
Ooh, come closer, baby
Shivers down my backbone
Cause my man is back
Then my voice began to race
When he laid beside me
Everything went black
Cause I've just seen
This stranger's face
Ooh, touch me
Yes I get the feeling
Touch me
Ooh, Lord, it feels good
Touch me
Yeah, I get the feeling
Touch me good
Touch me
Oh, oh, I get the feeling
Touch me
Don't you know it feels good
Touch me
Mmm hmm, yeah, you got the feeling
Touch me
Oh, you make me feel good
Touch me
I get the feeling
Touch me
Lord, you make me feel good
Touch me
Oh, I get the feeling
Touch me, yeah, hey
Touch me
Oh, baby, why don't you
Touch me
You make me feel so good
Oh, baby, touch me
Yeah, I know you got the feeling
Touch me
Yeah, you make me feel so good
Touch me...
