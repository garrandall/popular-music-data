Childhood living it's easy to do
The things that you wanted
well, I bought them for you
Graceless lady you know who I am
You know I can't let you just slide through my hands

Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild horses couldn't drag me away

I watched you suffer a dull aching pain
Now you've decided to show me the same
No sweeping exits or offstage lines
Will make me feel bitter or treat you unkind

Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild horses couldn't drag me away

I know I've dreamt you a sin and a lie
And I have my freedom, but I don't have much time
Fate has been suffered, and tears must be cried
So let's do some living after we die

Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild horses couldn't drag me away

Away
