Sugar and spice and all things nice
Kisses sweeter than wine
Sugar and spice and all things nice
You know that little girl is mine

Everybody stops and stares at my baby
When she's walkin' down the street
People passin' by just look at my baby
'Cause my baby looks so sweet
You know she's...

Sugar and spice and all things nice
Kisses sweeter than wine
Sugar and spice and all things nice
You know that little girl is mine

Everytime we kiss I get that feelin'
Everytime we simply meet
When I see her smile I get that feelin'
'Cause my baby looks so sweet
You know she's...

Sugar and spice and all things nice
Kisses sweeter than wine
Sugar and spice and all things nice
You know that little girl is mine
Never ever known a girl so lovely
Sweet enough to want to eat
Everybody's crazy 'bout my baby
'Cause my baby looks so sweet
You know she's...

Sugar and spice and all things nice
Kisses sweeter than wine
Sugar and spice and all things nice
You know that little girl is mine
