Lover, I just can't believe it's turned 
You're tearing my life apart 
There's no simple answer 
Here I am, just standing in circles 

And the logic is turning me round 
My mind keeps holding 
Only one thought 

When you gonna call 
I think it's worth the time 
How you gonna change 
All these endless nights 
If you could stop 
Leading me around 
You're never gonna change 
All these endless nights 

Tender, the way 
That you touched me now 
We were taking our fears away 
There won't be no reason 
Just a well rehearsed explanation 

Though the love 
That is turning inside 
Keeps on twisting 
Twisting my mind 

When you gonna call 
I think it's worth the time 
How you gonna change 
All these endless nights 
If you could stop 
Leading me around 
You're never gonna change 
All these endless, endless nights 
I wish that you could change 
All these endless, endless nights 

And the hope 
That is holding me here 
It's starting to die, oh, no 
Is it ever gonna stop 

When you gonna call 
I think it's worth the time 
How you gonna change 
All these endless nights 
If you could stop 
Leading me around 
You're never gonna change 
All these endless, endless nights 
I wish that you could change 
All these endless, endless nights 
All these endless 
Endless nights now 

When you gonna call 
I think it's worth the time 
I wish that you would call now
When you gonna change 
All these endless, endless nights
