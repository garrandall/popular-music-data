You know the best things in life are free
But you can give 'em to the birds and bees

I want money
Yeah, lots of money, child
Yeah, stomp and shout, work it on out
Every day, yeah

You know there's many things to cure your ills
But there is one thing gonna pay your bills

And that's money
Yeah, money, child
Yeah, stomp and shout, work it on out
Every day, yeah

You know there's lots of things that I'd like to do
Yeah, child, I wanna do 'em with you

And that takes money
Yeah, lots of money, child
Yeah, stomp and shout, work it on out
Every day, yeah
