Young, gifted and black
Oh what a lovely precious dream
To be young, gifted and black
Open your heart to what I mean

In the whole world you know
There's a million boys and girls
Who are young, gifted and black
And that's a fact

You are young, gifted and black
We must begin to tell our young
There's a world waiting for you
Yours is a quest that's just begun

When you're feeling really low
Yeah, there's a great truth that you should know
When you're young, gifted and black
Your soul's intact

How to be young, gifted and black
Oh how I long to know the truth
There are times when I look back
And I am haunted by my youth

Oh but my joy of today
Is that we can all be proud to say
To be young, gifted and black
Is where it's at
Is where it's at
Is where it's at
