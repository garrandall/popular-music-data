Save me
Free me
From my heart this time
Well the train's gone
Down the track and I'm
I'm left behind

But nothing can save me from this ball and chain
I've made up my mind I would leave today
But you're keeping me going I know it's insane
'Cause I'll love you and lose again

Well the heart calls
And the mind obeys
Oh it knows better than me baby
And if I hold on for one more day
Oh maybe maybe he'll be true

But nothing can save me from this ball and chain
I've made up my mind I would leave today
But you're keeping me going I know it's insane
'Cause I'll love you and lose again

Nothing can save me from this ball and chain
I've made up my mind I would leave today
But you're keeping me going I know it's insane
'Cause I'll love you and lose again
Woah I'll love you and lose again
