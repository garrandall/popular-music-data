I must have rehearsed my lines
A thousand times
Until I had them memorized

But when I get up the nerve
To tell you the words
Just never seem to come out right


If only you knew
How much I do
Do love you

If only you knew
How much I do
I do need you


I dream of moments we share
But you're not there
I'm living in a fantasy

Cause you don't even suspect
Could probably care less
About the changes I been going through


If only you knew
How much I do
Do love you

If only you knew
How much I do
I do need you


No, you don't even suspect
Could probably care less
About the changes I been going through
