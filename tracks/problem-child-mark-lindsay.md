You know you're acting like a fool girl
Those city boys are gonna send you to school girl
They'll chew you up and spit you out into the cruel world
And you'll curl into a big old ball and come rolling home

Problem child
Somewhere in the city night on the streets running wild
Where can you be?
Problem child
Girl don't let those city lights take your sweet country smile
Away from me

I can give you a complete love
It ain't the kind you'll find on the street love
You can fight it but you know you want to feel love
Oh my sweet love
Is gonna bring you running home to your man

Problem child
Somewhere in the city night on the streets running wild
Where can you be?
Problem child
Girl don't let those city lights take your sweet country smile
Away from me

Problem child
Somewhere in the city night on the streets running wild
Where can you be?
Problem child
Girl don't let those city lights take your sweet country smile
Away from me

Such a problem child
Somewhere in the city night on the streets running wild
Where can you be?
Problem child
