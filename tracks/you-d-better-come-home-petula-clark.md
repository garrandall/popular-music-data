You'd better come home and stop your running around
You'd better come home and get your feet on the ground
Cause I won't share my love with anyone new
You'd better be smart, you've gotta make up your mind
Stop breaking my heart and leave the others behind
Cause I won't share my love whatever I do
The love that I give for as long as I live will be yours
And nothing can change the way that I feel
So, baby, come back to me (baby, come back to me)
Baby, come back to me (baby, come back to me)
Love me like you did before
You'd better come home and see the damage you've done
You'd better come home because you've had all your fun
And I won't share my love with anyone new
No oh no
The love that I give for as long as I live will be yours
And nothing can change the way that I feel
So, baby, come back to me (baby, come back to me)
Baby, come back to me (baby, come back to me)
Love me like you did before
You'd better come home and see the damage you've done
You'd better come home because you've had all your fun
And I won't share my love with anyone new
No oh no
I just want to share it with you
You'd better come home
You'd better come home
You'd better come home
