Show show show show, show show show show
Show show show show, show show show
Showin' out, showin' out
Showin' out, showin' out
Showin' out, showin' out

Get fresh at the weekend
Showin' out, showin' out
Get fresh at the weekend
Showin' out, showin' out

You'd better live in love than luxury, it's alright
And don't be dining out on foolish dreams every night

O-o-only takes a moment to feel alright
Get fresh at the weekend, showin' out
Get fresh at the weekend, showin' out
Showin' out, showin' out

Can't afford to wear diamond and pearl, that's okay
Wouldn't want to be that kind of girl anyway

O-o-only takes a moment to feel alright
Get fresh at the weekend, showin' out
Get fresh at the weekend, showin' out
Showin' out, showin' out

I can supply you things
I can provide everything
If it's the man's hand that pays the price
Then you belong to me

Only only only o' (show show show show)
Only only only o' (show show show show)
Only only only o' (show show show show)
Only only only o' (show show show show)

Can't afford to buy finer things, that's alright
We won't just lose our heads for anything anytime

O-o-only takes a moment to feel alright
Get fresh at the weekend, showin' out, showin' out
Get fresh at the weekend, showin' out
Get fresh at the weekend, showin' out, showin' out, showin' out
Get fresh at the weekend, showin' out

Showin' out, I'm showin' out
Showin' out, I'm showin' out
