Lights go down, wheels go around
I'm taking you home
Hoping for a slow song to come on the radio now
I'm not ready to shut it down
The way the dashboard glow
Is hitting your eyes making me lose everything on my mind
And the only thing I wanna do is find a spot
Stop this car and throw it in park and get just

Slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot
(Slow dance in a parking lot)

Half song gone, one door open, across the lot
A rent-a-cop's rolling a security car
And its yellow lights spinning and flashing in time
To the radio singing
A little Garth Brooks
You start humming the very last verse to "She's Every Woman"
And I don't care what song comes next
I'm falling right here, don't wanna safety net in a

Slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot

And get close to you
Making the most of whatever we got, even if its just

A slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot
