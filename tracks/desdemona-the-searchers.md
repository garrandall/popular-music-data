Haven't you noticed something different
Just take a real look
Baby, my mind is like an open book
Baby, believe me know I've found you
Highway in the sky
It's great to be with you and flying high

Desdemona
Something you got to kiss keep going
Loves all around
And oveflowing through my mind

Desdemona
One little kiss see me shaking
Just like a top
Where plays are taking down the line

I'm not a boy with toy
I'm a boy who knows what loving is
I want to teach you all the time
Loving that I feel
Love is real

I want to give you something bad
I'm going to bring you through
You're going to let me think the way I do

We gotta get along together
Make sure your love is mine
We're going to see you love is oh so fine.
