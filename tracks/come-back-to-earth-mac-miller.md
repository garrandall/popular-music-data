My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send
I got neighbors, they're more like strangers, we could be friends
I just need a way out of my head
I'll do anything for a way out of my head

In my own way, this feel like living
Some alternate reality
I was drowning, but now I'm swimming
Through stressful waters into relief, yeah
Oh, all the things I'd do
To spend a little time in hell
And what I won't tell you
I'll prolly never even tell myself
And don't you know that the sunshine don't feel right
When you're inside all day
I wish it was nice out, but it looked like rain
Grey skies, I'm drifting, not living forever
They told me it only gets better

My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send
I got neighbors, they're more like strangers, we could be friends
I just need a way out of my head
I'll do anything for a way out of my head
Of my head
