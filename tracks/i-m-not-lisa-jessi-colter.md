I'm not Lisa
My name is Julie
Lisa left you years ago
My eyes are not blue
But mine won't leave you
Until the sunlight has touched your face

She was your morning light
Her smile told of no night
Your love for her grew
With each rising sun

And then one winter day
His hand led hers away
She left you here drowning in your tears, here
Where you've stayed for years
Crying Lisa, Lisa

I'm not Lisa
My name is Julie
Lisa left you years ago
My eyes are not blue
But mine won't leave you
Until the sunlight has touched your face

I'm not Lisa
