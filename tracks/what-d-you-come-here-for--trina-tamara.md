* this version features a Trina and Tamara rap
Ya say cats dancing up in here
Hey yo, ya'll cats wanna dance?
My jewelry say it all
Girls that pass, knee buckle
Ten G rings my as you knuckles
Why play me up close?
Man you slow like a tug boat
All my nigga's love pote
Bunch of OJ's cuz they cut throats
No scrubs, my man playin my ride
Hundred bottles you see right there
Ya'll wanna dance? I'll be right here
1 - Don't stop the beat movin'
You should be bouncing
Why you standing around and
Actin' like you're just too fly
You should be movin each and every time
Can't you see what everyone's doin'
I just know you need to be groovin'
So when you hear it just get on the floor
Trina and Tamara on the radio
You know just what I wanna do
Oh baby when we go to the club
So why you standing there
Acting like you don't care
I think I'm gonna get up on the floor
What is wrong with you
Tell me what you wanna do
You shoulda stayed home
I don't know what you came here for
All day you were talkin'
'Bout how you couldn't wait to
Get out on the floor with me
Oh, boy I swear I refuse to
Sit here cuz everybody's bouncing to the beat
What is wrong wit you
What you wanna do boy, yeah
I feel like you shoulda stayed at home, so
Yo, you know the T and baby TM
740i, three TV's, 30 CD's
Chrome Bb's, bumpin' esto and TD
Hate me know, we by the bar doin it up
Bottle after bottle, second case of cristal
Celebrating my misfoul
Cats on the side nervous cuz they seen us
Hit a bouncer wit a G and slide em wit the neena's
Plus we got gem stars between us
These rappers for real, I give 'em too many chances
I blow wit your advances on lap dances
In one verse I stop 'em
Make 'em start from scratch
Peep the Rolley, then flood it from the face to the latch
