There's somebody waiting alone in the street
For someone to walk up and greet
Here you are all alone in the city
Where's the love that you took to your side
Lonely faces will stare through your eyes in the night

And they'll say
Woman sweet woman
Please come home with me
You're shining and willing and free
But your love is a common occurrence
Not like love that I feel in my heart
Still you know that may be what I need

Is someone to lay down beside me
And even though it's not real
Just someone to lay down beside me
You're the story of my life

Someone to lay down beside me
And even though it's not real
Just someone to lay down beside me
You're the story of my life

The morning is breaking
The street lights are off
The sun will soon share all the cost
Of a world that can be sort of heartless
Not like love that I feel in my heart
Still you know that may be all you'll get

Is someone to lay down beside you
And even though it's not real
Just someone to lay down beside you
You just can't ask for more
