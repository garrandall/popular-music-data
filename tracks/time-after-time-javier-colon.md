Lying in bed, I hear the, clock tick I think of you
Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new
Flashback to warm nights, almost left behind
Suitcase of memories time after...

Sometimes you picture me, walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, can't hear what you said
And you say go slow, I fall behind
The second hand unwinds


If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you I will be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you I will be waiting
Time after time

After my picture fades and, darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm ok
Secrets stolen, from deep inside
The drum beats out of time



time after time after time after...
suitcase of memories almost left behind
time after time after time after...
time after.....
time
