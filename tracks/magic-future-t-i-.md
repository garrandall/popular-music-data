The call it odd future, I say the future's odd
The latest band to rise to fame's talking 'bout raping broads
You're Tyler The Creator and you can kiss my ass
And when you get your Krispy check
Go buy yourself some class
Prove to me you're real O.G
And Twitter me your dick
And don't forget to list the things I can do with it
"You old bitch, I'ma fuckin' stick my black dick--
I'ma fuck you in your ear hole
I'ma fuck you in your ass and I'll fucking rape your mouth"
Say what?
S-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-say what?


I'm sick and tired, sick as can be
Of controversy for the sake of controversy
I'm sick and tired, sick as can be
I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired
Things are always changing
Not always for the better
I'll fuck you and your boys up
You think you're so damn clever
Hey man, I know you were kidding
I'll call you on your shit in a New York minute
I rip your shit like a Bengal tiger
Animal instincts, I know you're a liar
Liar, liar, pants on fire
Hanging from the interweb wires


You've got the ear of all the kids, you know that's tragic
If you wanna run your mouth, go ahead, fantastic
But don't let me catching you using words like 'faggot'
Or I'm gonna have to break out my white magic
White magic, white magic, white magic, white magic


Give me the opportunity to let you love me
'Cause I'm a hustler and a G
And close your eyes and count to 3
Then open them wide
Tell me, tell me what you see
Go on, tell me what you see
My mother told me to pick a dare
Best one, I'm sorry, tough luck, tough shit
You're not that one
You'll never be that one
Hello, hello
Is anybody there?
Hello, hello
Does anybody care?
Hello, hello
Is anybody there?
Hello, hello
Does anybody care?


You've got the ear of all the kids, you know that's tragic
If you wanna run your mouth, go ahead, fantastic
But don't let me catching you using words like--
Or I'm gonna have to break out my white magic
White magic, white magic, white magic
You've got the ear of all the kids, you know that's tragic
If you wanna run your mouth, go ahead, fantastic
But don't let me catching you using words like--
Or I'm gonna have to break out my white magic
White magic, white magic, white magic


This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
Let it shine
Let it shine
Is this fun?
Are we having fun yet?
Are we having fun yet?
Are we having fun yet?
Are we having fun yet?
