I remember the very first time
You the picture of love in my heart
You and me, girl, holding hands
Please be my lady, won't you understand 
(I need a girlfriend) I need a girlfriend
And I need her right now
Loving, kissing, holding you tight
Never letting go

(I need a girlfriend) I need a girlfriend
And I need her right now

Can I call you, would that be all right
Maybe Friday or Saturday night
Girl, I think of you all the time
'Cause it's you that I need, girl, and you're always on my mind

(I need a girlfriend)
And I need you right now
Loving, kissing. holding you tight
Never letting go

(I need a girlfriend) I need a girlfriend
And I need you right now
Loving, kissing, holding you tight
And keeping you warm, oh, yeah

Who feels like I do
Could it be you
So please help me yeah, yeah

Gotta have your love, oh, baby
Loving, kissing, holding you tight
Never letting go

And I need you right now, no

And keeping you warm, baby

Someone just like you
