It's so hard to leave you
I don't really wanna go
I don't wanna say goodbye to you
It's the last thing I wanna do
But I won't be sad now
'Cause till you're in my arms again
You'll be inside of my heart
And wherever I go
We'll never really be apart

Chorus:
We'll be wishing on the same star
Looking at the same moon
When you're thinking of me baby
I'll be thinking of you
And no matter where I go
I will be there with you
Wishing on the same star
Looking at the same moon

It's not really over

Baby it wil lnever be
Long as you keep me in your heart
I'll be there anywhere you are
And when you feel sad
Remember all the love we shared
And when you're feeling alone
Well just look up in the sky
Oh and baby so will I


No matter where you turn around
It's the same sun that keeps shining down
Wherever we'll be
I know that we'll be
