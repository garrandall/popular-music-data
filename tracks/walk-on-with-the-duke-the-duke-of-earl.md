Yeah
Uh
Yaooo

Sean Price, King Kong in the place
Big gun, watch the bullet bing bong in ya face
Murdered the bastard, he murders the surgery plastic
Face reconstruction when the 8 heating something, uh!
Touch you bad when you hit with the hard hawk
P! My knuckles drag when the God walk
I ain't old school, I ain't new school
I'm a dropout with the tool that pop out
I'm the shit up in my hood
I had three wishes; I wish that a nigga would
Step to the God, when God step I step on ya squad
Imperius Rex the best, definition: The God
I swing things hurtin'
God body AKA the King James version
Playing my shit the same time hating my shit
Don't play at me bitch, I make your bitch play with my dick

I'm, the King X Rock; there is none higher
Th'fuck rhyme better than me?
P, P, P!
Nigga, I'm nothin to play with
Kneel down, kiss the ring
Listen
I'm, the King X Rock; there is none higher
The fuck rhyme better than me?
P, P, P!
Nigga, I'm nothin to play with
God body, AKA the King James version

I used to dispurse raw
Behind my mom's back and she lived on the first floor
Heard yours, I hurt your feelings
Feelings get hurt, gun burst and earth your ceiling, P!
Appetite for destruction
Savage life might strike a dyke if you fronting
Write something
Never polite, ignite the mic slice something
Loot for a curl, rappin' at you; you cute for a girl
I 'url on you duke, now you be the Duke of the Earl
Listen, don't make dollars that don't make sense
I do make dollars, dumb bars don't make cents, uh!
The education of Sean Price
Dedication, the medication and long nights
Smokin' the pancake
Work on consignment, lot of dope for a handshake

I'm, the King X Rock; there is none higher
Th'fuck rhyme better than me?
P, P, P!
Nigga, I'm nothin to play with
Kneel down, kiss the ring
Listen
I'm, the King X Rock; there is none higher
Th'fuck rhyme better than me?
P, P, P!
Nigga, I'm nothin to play with
God body, AKA the King James version

The crown is mine

I'm not your friend dukes
Don't talk to me like that
Word... the friend thing?
We're not friends...
We're not friendS
Be clear on that... clearly we're not...
The Stephen A Smith voice:
Clearly we're not friends... clearly
You being my friend is asinine, ass-a-ten, ass-eleven
