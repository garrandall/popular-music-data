Why y'all trippin, I'm just fine
Twelve forty five, 'bout that time
Couldn't get it all week, time to unwind
Drank like tank, blew my mind
This shit crazy, way too packed
Rosetti baby, waste two stacks
Hottest thing in the lot, that there mine
Can't spell sober, lose my mind


I'm hearin' voices in my head think I'm schizophrenic
I swear they sayin' lets get it from another planet
Thirty six thousand times I'm doin' summer salts
Do it right and you can leave ya whole summer off
I'm out my mind, yeah a nigga seein' double ya'll
Tell me what's the chance of jeezy fuckin' both of ya'll
She sad as long as we can do it with ya ice on
If that's the case we might as well leave the lights on
I'm out my mind, just blew a thousand swisher sweets
In my black and orange charger, call it trick or treat
It ain't nothin' to a boss, my goons got goons
House stupid dumb big, my rooms got rooms

Guess what my momma told me, she hate my partnas
Guess why she hate em though,
'Cause all of 'em robbin'
Fuck the police, 'cause all of 'em problems
White girls fun, 'cause all of 'em swallow
Why I ain't fuck her at the house, 'cause the bitch holla
And where the pill man at, he need a blue dolphin
All broke ass nigga, stop cock blockin'
Security, I need help 'cause the bitch stalkin'
A half fuckin' mill, that's what the whip cost me
One-hundred dollars, that's what the pussy cost me
And when the nigga start hatin', that's when the nigga lost me
Fantastico, that's what the hoes call me

Drop the top, no bra, got da titties out
Mention my name and bring the whole city out
Doin' what I do best, d-boy stuntin'
New car, old money, d-boy stuntin'
Step in cleaner then a new glock-40
Nickname in the A, strapped up shorty
You know my nerves bad, trigger like a toothpick
Line wrapped around the corner, boy too big
G-O, black shades and my black chains
But if you wouldn't understand,it's a black thing
You know we drink that rozay 'til we black out
Wake up, drink some more, pass back out
