I know what boys like
I know what guys want
I know what boys like
I've got what boys like
I know what boys like
I know what guys want
I see them looking
I make them want me
I like to tease them
They want to touch me
I never let them


I know what boys like
I know what guys want
I know what boys like
Boys like, boys like me


But you, you're special
I might let you
You're so much different
I might let you
Mmm, would you like that
I might let you


I know what boys like
I know what guys want
I know what boys like
I know what's on their minds
I know what boys like
I know what guys want
They talk about me
I got my cat moves
That so upset them
Zippers and buttons
Fun to frustrate them
They get so angry
Like pouty children
Denied their candy
I laugh right at them


I know what boys like
I know what guys want
I know what boys like
Boys like, boys like me


Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah


I feel sad now
I will let you
Sorry I teased you
I will let you
This time I mean it
I will let you
Anything you want
You can trust me
I really want to
You can trust me
How would you like it
You can trust me
Sucker
Hmhmhmm


I know what boys like
I know what guys want
I know what boys like, boys
Like, boys like me


Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
