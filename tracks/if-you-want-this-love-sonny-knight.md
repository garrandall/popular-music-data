If you want this love of mine
Treat me gentle, treat me kind
Don't be mean and don't be bad
And you'll get the truest love that ya ever had

If you want my lips to kiss
Cuddle close and don't resist
Lovin' you is all I crave
And if you let me, pretty baby,
I'll be your slave

If you want this love of mine
Baby, come on and get it
If you should fall in love with me
I'll bet you never regret it

Not a thing I wouldn't do
I'd do anything just for you
Just let me know that you're really mine because
I want to love ya 'till the end of time

Not a thing I wouldn't do
I'd do anything just for you
Just let me know that you're really mine because
I want to love ya 'till the end of time

I just wanna make love to you, baby
So you better come on and get it (FADE)
