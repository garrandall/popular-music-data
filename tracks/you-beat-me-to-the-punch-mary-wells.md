That day, I first saw you, whoa whoa, passing by
I wanted to know your name but I was just too shy
But I was looking at you so hard
Until you must have had a hunch
So you came up to me and asked me my name
You beat me to the punch, that time
You beat me to the punch oh, oh, oh, oh
You beat me to the punch

Whoa, after I hadn't known you for it seemed like a long, long time
I wanted, wanted to ask you would you please, please be mine
Whenever you came around, my heart would pound
So you must have had a hunch
So you came up to me and asked me to be yours
You beat me to the punch one more time
You beat me to the punch oh, oh, oh, oh
You beat me to the punch, yeah

Since I love you I thought you would be true
And love me tender, so I let my heart surrender
To you, yes I did
But I found out beyond a doubt one day boy, you were a playboy
Who would go away and leave me blue
So I ain't gonna wait around for you to put me down
This time I'm gonna play my hunch
And walk away this very day
And beat you to the punch
Yes I will and let you know how it feels, oh, oh, oh
