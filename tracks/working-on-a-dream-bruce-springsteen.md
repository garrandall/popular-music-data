Out here the nights are long, the days are lonely 
I think of you and I'm working on a dream 
I'm working on a dream 

Now the cards I've drawn's a rough hand, darling 
I straighten the back and I'm working on a dream 
I'm working on a dream 

Come on! 

I'm working on a dream 
Though sometimes it feels so far away 
I'm working on a dream 
And I know it will be mine someday 

Rain pourin' down, I swing my hammer 
My hands are rough from working on a dream 
I'm working on a dream 

Let's go! 

I'm working on a dream 
Though trouble can feel like it's here to stay 
I'm working on a dream 
Well our love will chase trouble away 

Alright! 

 
That's professional whistling right there! 

I'm working on a dream 
Though it can feel so far away 
I'm working on a dream 
Our love will make it real someday 

The sun rise up, I climb the ladder 
The new day breaks and I'm working on a dream 
I'm working on a dream 
I'm working on a dream 
I'm working on a dream 

Hey! 

I'm working on a dream 
Though it can feel so far away 
I'm working on a dream 
Our love will make it real someday 
I'm working on a dream 
Though it can feel so far away 
I'm working on a dream 
And our love will make it real someday
