I need your love,
I need your love... 
You, give me light
So tonight, take me there
I, feel your sun
Start to glow and I know it
Let me show you that
I want your love
I need your touch
For the rest, of our time together,
Baby, come fly with me, eternally
You and me,
We were meant to be

Yeah hey
Alright (right now)
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
Yeah hey
Alright (right now)
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever

I see your eyes,
Hold the key, to my paradise
Summer in your smile
Well it makes me feel, so real
You tell me things
And my heart sings to the world,
From islands in the sky
Take my hand
As one we will stand
You know it's never never
To say hello to forever

Yeah hey
Alright (right now)
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever

I need your touch,
I want your love so much
I need your touch &
I want your love, so much
Oh now, tonight,
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
