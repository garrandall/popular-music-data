It seems like this? Came on me
I'm lost in a sea of misery
My love has turned his back on me
Heartache, why won't ya let me be

I said now, baby
Have some mercy please
Don't make me beg on a bended knees
Oh please, mercy mercy mercy please
Have mercy on me
Mercy mercy mercy please

Oh, how can I face life, without you
What would I do if we were through

Don't you know, babe
I wait for you
Every single night
Hoping you'll return and make things right

You don't show and I'm sittin' here
All alone, all alone
To pray you're gonna call me on the phone
Baby have some mercy please
Don't make your mama beg on a bended knees
Oh please, mercy mercy mercy please
Have mercy on me
Mercy mercy mercy please

You know I love you
And I'm beggin'
For one more chance, one chance, once more

Mmm hm, I know
Life's got many a twist
But lovin' you, Danny
Is the thing I cannot resist
Your love and understanding
You been givin', givin', givin'
Without it I just can't go on livin'

Baby have some mercy please
Don't me beg on bended knees
I said mercy, mercy, mercy
Woah, please have mercy on me
Mercy, mercy, mercy, woooo
Have mercy on me baby

One more time
Have mercy on me baby
