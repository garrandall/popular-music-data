It's A Tug Of War
What With One Thing And Another
It's A Tug Of War
We Expected More
But With One Thing And Another
We Were Trying To Outdo Each Other
In A Tug Of War

In Another World
In Another World We Could
Stand On Top Of The Mountain
With Our Flag Unfurled
In A Time To Come
In A Time To Come We Will Be
Dancing To The Beat Played
On A Different Drum

It's A Tug Of War
Though I Know I Mustn't Grumble
It S A Tug Of War
But I Can't Let Go
If I Do You'll Take A Tumble
And The Whole Thing Is Going To Crumble
It's A Tug Of War

Pushing Pushing, Pulling Puliing
Pushing And Pulling

In Years To Come They May Discover
What The Air We Breathe And The Life We Lead
Are All About
But It Won't Be Soon Enough
Soon Enough For Me
No It Won't Be Soon Enough
Soon Enough For Me

In Another World We Couid
Stand On Top Of The Mountain
With Our Flag Unfurled
In A Time To Come We Willbe
Dancing To The Beat Played
On A Different Drum

We Will Be Dancing To The Beat
Played On A Different Drum
We Will Be Dancing To The Beat
Played On A Different Drum

It's A Tug Of War, A Tug Of War
A Tug Of War
What With One Thing And Another
It's A Tug Of War
We Expected More
But With One Thing And Another
In A Tug Of War

Pushing Pushing, Pulling Pulling
Pushing And Pulling
