I'm sorry I didn't mean to call you
But I coudn't fight it
I guess I was weak and couldn't even hide it
And so I surrended just to hear your voice
I know how many times I said I'm gonna to live with out you
and maybe someone else is standing there beside you
But there is something baby that you need to know
That deep inside me i feel like I'm dying
I have to see you it's all that I'm asking

Vida, give me back my fantasies,
The courage that I need to live
The air that I Breathe
Carino mio, my worlds become so empty
My day's are so cold and lonely,
and each night I taste
The purest of Pain

I wish I could tell you I'm feeling better every day
That it din't hurt me when you walked away
But to tell you the truth I can't find my way
And deep inside me I feel like I'm dying
I have to see you it's all that I'm asking
