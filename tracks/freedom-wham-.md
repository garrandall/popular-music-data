Everyday I hear a different story
People saying that you're no good for me
"Saw your lover with another, and she's making a fool of you."

If you loved me baby, you'd deny it
But you laugh and tell me I should try it
Tell me I'm a baby and I don't understand

But you know that I'll forgive you
Just this once, twice, forever
'Cause, baby, you could drag me to hell and back
Just as long as we're together
And you do

I don't want your freedom
I don't want to play around
I don't want nobody, baby
Part-time love just brings me down
I don't need your freedom
Girl, all I want right now is you

Like a prisoner who has his own key
But I can't escape until you love me
I just go from day to day
Knowing all about the other boys

You take my hand and tell me I'm a fool
To give you all that I do
I bet you: someday, baby
Someone says the same to you

But you know that I'll forgive you
Just this once, twice, forever
'Cause, baby, you could drag me to hell and back
Just as long as we're together
And you do

Oh oh

I don't want your freedom
I don't want to play around
I don't want nobody, baby
Part-time love just brings me down
I don't want your freedom
Girl, all I want right now is you

Do do do do do
Can't you see you're hurting me?
Do do do do do

You're hurting me, baby
Hurting me, baby

Oh oh

Do do doo doo

You're hurting me baby
Hurting me baby

But you know that I'll forgive you
Just this once, twice, forever
'Cause, baby, you could drag me to hell and back
Just as long as we're together
And you do oh

I don't want your freedom
I don't need to play around
I don't want nobody, baby
Part-time love just brings me down
I don't want your freedom
I don't want to play around
I don't want nobody, baby
Part-time love just brings me down

I don't want your
I don't want your
I don't want your
I don't want your
I don't want your
I don't want your
I don't want your
I don't want your
