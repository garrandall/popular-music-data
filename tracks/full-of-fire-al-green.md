Oh, you're full of fire and you're my one desire
You're all full of fire, full of fire
It's about to make me cry, mmmhmmm
When you dance, to the music
And you shake it girl, all night long
When you jam with the band
It's all over
Full of fire, full of fire, full of fire
I'm on your party line, yeaaah
You're all full of fire
Full of fire
And I got wings to fly, girl

You can dance with the party
With your special kind burning love
I can't wait to define this over
Woah, oh, oh, oh

Oh, full of fire I hit my 21 (21)
You're all full of fire and life has just begun
You can dance to the music
Oh girl you make me understand
I got a feeling that like a bolt of lightning
There's a hole in my head
Oh, you can boogie all night long with the music
Woah, oh, oh, oh...
Oh, you're full of fire
I'm on your party line, girl
Mmm, you're full of fire, full of fire
Enough to blow my mind, mmmhmm
When you dance to the music
And you're jamming, and you're jamming, girl
When you jam with the band
It's all over

Dance, dance, dance, you dance
Mmmm hmmm, you can dance girl
Ah hah understand it
It's a kind of power
Must you make me understand
It's a kind of, kind of power
Mmmm mm understand
Oh baby you can dance...
