I'm full of fire (Full of fire, full of fire)
You're my one desire
Babe, I'm full of fire (Full of fire, full of fire)
You can make me cry

I can dance to the music
I can sing all night long
I can play with the band
Until you hear my song

'Cause I'm full of fire (Full of fire, full of fire)
To see the party light
Hey, I'm full of fire (Full of fire, full of fire)
Think they're red and white

I can dance with the fire
Burnin', burnin' love
I can stay until the party is all over


Hey, I'm full of fire (Full of fire, full of fire)
And I'm over twenty-one
Hey, I'm full of fire (Full of fire, full of fire)
And my life has just begun

Ooh ooh, I can dance to the music
Girl, I can understand
That there must be in life a power
That is holding my hand


Dance, dance, dance
Oh, I understand
Young lady, young man
I say I understand


Hey, I'm full of fire (Full of fire, full of fire)
And I'm over twenty-one
Hey, I'm full of fire (Full of fire, full of fire)
And my life has just begun

Ooh ooh, I can dance to the music
I, I can under, understand
That there must be in life a power
That is holding my hand, hey


Dance, dance, dance
Oh, I understand
Young lady, young man
I say I understand


I can dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Hey hey, I understand
Stand, understand, understand
Hey hey, there's some things I may not know
But I want the horns to blow
Hey hey, there's some things I may not know
But I want the horns to blow
Hey, hey, and I can dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Hey hey, I understand
Stand, understand, understand
Hey hey, there's some things I may not know
But I want the horns to blow
Hey hey, there's some things I may not know
But I want the horns to blow
Hey hey, and I can dance
Let me say that I can dance
Hey, I'm full of fire, my heart's desire
Hey hey, I'm full of fire
