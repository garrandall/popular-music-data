Don't worry 'bout me, it's all over now
Though I may be blue, I'll manage somehow
Love can't be explained, can't be controlled
One day it's warm, next day it's cold

Don't pity me, 'cause I'm feeling blue
Don't be ashamed it might happen to you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, love, kiss me
One time then go love, I'll understand
Don't worry 'bout me

Sweet, sweet, sweet, love will I want you to be
As happy as I when you love me
I'll never forget you your sweet memory it's all over now
Don't worry bout me

When one heart tells one heart, one heart goodbye
One heart is free, one heart will cry
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh sweet, sweet baby, sweet baby, sweet
It's all right, don't worry 'bout me...
