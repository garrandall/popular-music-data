Let's jump in my El Camino - Uh huh
Roll the windows down
Thought we could see what kind of trouble 
we can find out on this messed up little town

The Boss on the radio- uh huh
Take whatever comes
We'll go flying down the highway with my arms around you singing Born To Run

It feels just like it should
Must be some kind of miracle
Like I got sun on my face and the rain ain't never going to fall
It feels so good
Oh It is almost spiritual
Tomorrow's nowhere in sight 
Right now, right here tonight 
It feels just like it should

Well you got your good looks - uh huh
And you got your style
And I'd drown here in this ocean
Just to have you float my boat for a while
I got a reputation - uh huh
Don't you worry about that
Just give me a chance and we'll never gonna ever look back

And it feels just like it should
It must be some kind of miracle
Like I got sun on my face and rain that ain't never going to fall
It feels so good
Man it's almost spiritual
Tomorrow's nowhere in sight 
Right now, right here tonight 
It feels just like it should

Maybe Romeo gets the girl this time
I guess everybody gets the chance to shine
And tonight is mine

It feels just like it should
Must be some kind of miracle
Like I got sun on my face and the rain it ain't never going to fall
Feels so good
Awww it's almost spiritual
Tomorrow's nowhere in sight 
Right now, right here tonight 
It feels just like it should
