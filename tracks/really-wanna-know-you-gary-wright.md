I don't mind being lonely
What I do mind if not being loved
Maybe you're feeling the same way too
You're ready to hold someone

I really wanna know you
I really wanna show you the way I feel
I really wanna know you
I really wanna show you the way I feel

Something about you is tells me
We're coming from the very same place
It's only just a notion I have
I see it written over your face

I really wanna know you
I really wanna show you the way I feel
I really wanna know you
I really wanna show you the way I feel, yeah, hey

You've got something about you that I want around me
Something I've been searching my whole life through
So now it's up to you, yeah, yeah
Tell me what you're gonna do
I wanna know yeah, yeah, yeah

Every time I see you
It's the same thing all over again
You're doing something to me it's true
And I don't want the feelin' to end

I really wanna know you
I really wanna show you the way I feel
I really wanna know you
I really wanna show you the way I feel, yeah, hey

You've got something about you that I want around me
Something I've been searching my whole life through
So now it's up to you, yeah, yeah
Tell me what you're gonna do
I wanna know yeah, yeah, yeah

I really wanna know you
I really wanna show you the way I feel
I really wanna know you
I really wanna show you the way I feel, yeah, hey

I really know, know, know you
I really show, show, show, you
I really know you
I really show you the way I feel
