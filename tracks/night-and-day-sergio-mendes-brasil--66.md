Night and day
You are the one
Only you beneath the moon
And under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, darling
Where you are
I think of you
Night and day

Day and night
Why is it so
That this longing for you
Follows wherever I go
In the roarin' traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you
Day and night

Night and day
Under the hide of me
There's an oh such a hungry
Yearnin' burnin' inside of me
And its torment won't be through
'Til you let me spend my life
Making love to you
Day and night
Night and day

Night and day
You are one
Only you 'neath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, baby, where you are
I think of you
Day and night

Night and day
Why is it so
That this longing for you
Follows wherever I go
In the roarin' traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you
Day and night

Night and day
Under the height of me
There's an oh such a hungry
Yearnin' burnin' inside of me
And its torment won't be through
'Til you let me spend life
Making love to you
Day and night
Night and day
