Four o'clock, I still can't find you
Scared of what our love has come to
I wait by the phone and I feel so alone
I cared for you
I think about the way you treat me
You care about your friends before me
Taken for granted and left empty handed
I needed you


Wish you could see
How much I did for you than me
And if I could
I would turn all the bad to good


Give me, just give me a reason
(Why should I come back to you?)
If you love me, then show me you care
Then I'll be there
Give me, just give me a reason
(Give me a reason)
If you love me, then show me you care
(Show me you care)
Then I'll be there
(Boy, why should I come back to you?)


Can't you see how much you hurt me
To give away your love so easily?
I opened my eyes and I saw your lies
Now you're on your knees
I think about the way that you treat me
To take you back you've got to show me
Say that you love me
So show me you care, then I'll be there


Wish you could see
How much I did for you than me
And if I could
I would turn all the bad to good


Give me, just give me a reason
(Why should I come back to you?)
If you love me, then show me you care
Then I'll be there
Give me, just give me a reason
(Give me a reason)
If you love me, then show me you care
(Show me you care)
Then I'll be there
(Boy, why should I come back to you?)


You know that I loved you
But you treated me so bad
(You've got to change if you want me back)
And maybe it won't hit you
Until you lose the one you had


Give me, just give me a reason
(Why should I come back to you?)
If you love me, then show me you care
(Show me you care)
Then I'll be there
(Boy, why should I come back to you?)
Give me, just give me a reason
(Give me a reason)
If you love me, then show me you care
(Show me you care)
Then I'll be there
(Boy, why should I come back to you?)


Give me a reason, give me a reason
(Why should I come back to you?)
If you love me, then show me you care
Then I'll be there
Give me a reason, give me a reason
(Why should I come back to you?)
If you love me, then show me you care
Then I'll be there
(Boy, why should I come back to you?)
