Time on my hands since you've been away boy
I ain't got no plans
No, no, no, no.
And the sound of the rain, against my windowpain.
Is slowly, slowly driving me insane.

Boy, I'm going down
I'm going down
'Cause you aint around, baby.
My whole world's turning upside down

Sleep don't come easy.
Boy, please believe me.
Since you've been gone, everything's going wrong.
Why'd you have to say goodbye?
Look what you've done to me
I can't stop these tears from falling from my eyes.

Oh Baby,
I'm going down.
I'm going down
'Cause you ain't around, baby.
My whole world's upside down.

You ain't around. Going down.
Oh Baby. I'm in love.
Going down. Oh, Oh, Oh,

I-I- I'm going down.
I'm going down.
'Cause you aint around, baby.
My whole worlds upside down

Going down, going down
Oh, babe.
Don't want believe.
If I can't give my love to you
Im so blue.
Going down.
Going down
You ain't around.
Baby, baby.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
What did I do wrong?
Please forgive me, baby, and come on home.
Going down.
Going down.
Going down.
