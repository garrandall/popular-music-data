Lido missed the boat that day
He left the shack
But that was all he missed
And he ain't comin back

At a tombstone bar
In a jukejoint car
He made a stop
Just long enough
To grab a handle off the top

Next stop Chi town
Lido put the money down let em roll
He said one more job ought to get it
One last shot 'fore we quit it
One for the road

Lido.. woah oh oh oh
He's for the money
He's for the show
Lido's waiting for the go

Lido.. woah oh oh oh
He said one more job ought to get it
One last shot 'fore we quit it
One more for the road

Lido will be runnin'
Havin' great big fun
Until he got the note
Sayin' tow the line or blow it
And that was all she wrote

He'll be makin' like a bee line
Headin' for the border line
Goin' for broke
Sayin' one more hit ought to do it
This joint aint nothin' to it
One more for the road

Lido.. whoah oh oh oh
He's for the money
He's for the show
Lido's waiting for the go

Lido.. woah oh oh oh oh oh oh
One more job ought to get it
One last shot then we quit it
One more for the road

Lido.. woah oh oh oh
He's for the money
He's for the show
Lido's a waitin' for the go
Lido.. woah oh oh oh
