Headin' up to San Francisco
For the Labor Day weekend show
I've got my Hush Puppies on
I guess I never was meant for
Glitter rock and roll
And honey I didn't know
That I'd be missin' you so


Come Monday It'll be all right
Come Monday I'll be holding you tight
I spent four lonely days in a brown L.A. haze
And I just want you back by my side


Yes it's been quite a summer
Rent-a-cars and west bound trains
And now you're off on vacation
Somethin' you tried to explain
And darlin' I love you so that's
The reason I just let you go


Come Monday It'll be all right
Come Monday I'll be holding you tight
I spent four lonely days in a brown L.A. haze
And I just want you back by my side


I can't help it honey
You're that much a part of me now
Remember that night in Montana when
We said there'd be no room for doubt


I hope you're enjoyin' the scenery
I know that it's pretty up there
We can go hikin on Tuesday
With you I'd walk anywhere
California has worn me quite thin
I just can't wait to see you again


Come Monday It'll be all right
Come Monday I'll be holding you tight
I spent four lonely days in a brown L.A. haze
And I just want you back by my side
