We may not yet have reached our glory
But I will gladly join the fight
And when our children tell their story
They'll tell the story of tonight
They'll tell the story of tonight
Tonight


Have you ever felt like nobody was there?
Have you ever felt forgotten in the middle of nowhere?
Have you ever felt like you could disappear?
Like you could fall, and no one would hear?


Well, let that lonely feeling wash away

All we see is light

'Cause maybe there's a reason to believe you'll be okay

For forever

'Cause when you don't feel strong enough to stand
You can reach, reach out your hand

And oh

Raise a glass to freedom
Something they can never take away

Oh

No matter what they tell you

Someone will coming running
They'll take you home

Raise a glass to all of us

Tomorrow there'll be more of us

Telling the story of tonight

Out of the shadows

The morning is breaking (they'll tell the story of)
And all is new (tonight)

All is new

All is new

It's only a matter of

Time

Even when the dark comes crashing through
When you need a friend to carry you
When you're broken on the ground
You will be found
So let the sun come streaming in
'Cause you'll reach up and you'll rise again
If you only look around
You will be found


And when our children tell their story

You will be found

They'll tell the story of tonight

Oh

No matter what they tell you

Tomorrow there'll be more of us

Telling the story of tonight
The story of tonight
