Down, Down, down, down,
Down, Down, Down, Down,
Take me, take me
Outta here, it makes me
Feels so, feels so
Na-na-nana-na

Baby, baby
Here we are all crazy
You don't have to worry
Na-na-nana-na

So follow me down (Where to?)
Out of this town (With you)
Girl you're moving way too slow...

So follow me down (Which way? Down, down...)
I'll show you around (ok)
There's a place we gotta go...

Follow me, follow me
Fol-la-la-lala
Follow me, follow me
Fol-la-la-lala

Uuuuuaah Oh
Uuuuuaah Oh
Uuuuuaah Oh Oh
Fol-la-la-lala

Dancing, walking
Clock keeps on tocking
They sing, they sing
Na-na-nana-na

Gentlemen and ladies
Animals and babies
We sing, we sing
Na-na-nana-na

So follow me down (Where to?)
Out of this town (With you)
Girl you're moving way too slow...

So follow me down (Which way? Down, down...)
I'll show you around (ok)
There's a place we gotta go...

Follow me, follow me
Fol-la-la-lala
Follow me, follow me,
Fol-la-la-lala

Uuuuuaah Oh
Uuuuuaah Oh
Uuuuuaah Oh Oh
Fol-la-la-lala

Follow me, follow me
Fol-la-la-lala
Follow me, follow me,
Fol-la-la-lala

Uuuuuaah Oh
Uuuuuaah Oh
Uuuuuaah Oh Oh
Fol-la-la-lala

Ah Ah Oh Ah
Ah Ah Oh Ah
Ah Ah Oh Oh

Ah Ah Oh Ah
Ah Ah Oh Ah
Ah Ah Oh Oh

Down, down, down, down
Oh Oh... (Ok!)
Down, down, down, down
Oh Oh

Follow me, follow me
Fol-la-la-lala
Follow me, follow me,
Fol-la-la-lala

Uuuuuaah Oh
Uuuuuaah Oh
Uuuuuaah Oh Oh
Fol-la-la-lala

Follow me, follow me
Fol-la-la-lala
Follow me, follow me,
Fol-la-la-lala

Uuuuuaah Oh
Uuuuuaah Oh
Uuuuuaah Oh Oh
Fol-la-la-lala
