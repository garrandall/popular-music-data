One more night, one more down
One more, one more round
First one in, last one out
Giving this town lots to talk about
They don't know what they don't know

People say I've got a drinkin' problem
That ain't no reason to stop
People saying that I've hit rock bottom
Just cause I'm living on the rocks
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull another bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I've got no problem drinkin' at all

They keep on talking, drawing conclusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution

Last call gets later and later
I come in here so I don't have to hate her
Same old folks, same old songs
The same old same old blue neon
The same old buzz, just because

People say I've got a drinkin' problem
That ain't no reason to stop
People saying that I've hit rock bottom
Just cause I'm living on the rocks
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull another bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I've got no problem drinkin' at all

They keep on talking, drawing conclusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution
Just sitting here in all my grand illusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution

Just a solution

It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull another bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I've got no problem drinkin' at all

They keep on talking, drawing conclusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution
Sitting here in all my grand illusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution
