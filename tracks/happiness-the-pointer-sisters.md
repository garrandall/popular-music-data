I love the way you love to live
You got life, you're inspiration
I love the way that you do
Your heart's so freely
You're a sweet sensation
You're my invitation to happiness
You're full of sweet surprises happiness
You fill my heart desire
More, more, more and more
And over and over again
Keep that goodness coming
I love the way you watch the world
Through kind eyes
That's why you're never sad, sad
Things don't bother you like dos, don'ts and whys
You hold on to the good and you let the bad go by
Yeah, yeah
Happiness
I want your love forever
Happiness
Give me your love forever
More, more, more and more
And over and over again
Keep that goodness coming
Happiness
Give me your love forever
Happiness
Say you'll leave me never
More, more, more and more
And over and over again
Keep that goodness coming
Keep it coming, keep it coming
Keep it coming, coming
Keep it coming, keep it coming
Keep it, keep it coming
