Can't tell you the truth
'Least I don't lie about that
Kind of comfort in you
Comes when you lie right back

Safe from such a strange point of view
To hear your own words on you

How much do you go to be gone?
You are any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows in

Don't wanna come down too low
Any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows in
Any way the wind blows in

Similar creatures we are
Chasing the pipe dream down
Love elusive so far
Keeps us divided now

Go, go on and write me love songs
So I have something to sing when your gone

How much do you go to be gone?
You are any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows in

Don't wanna come down too low
Any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows in

Don't wanna come down
Do you know the way
To be in one place but sway?
Anyway the wind's blowin'

You are love, you are love
You are monsters and angels
Untouched, unseen

All in one, all in one
I take all that you are
'Cause you're just like me
But you move and it's hard
To stay close to a satellite

So I lose sight of you
Till you come round again
I'm watching the wind

Hey ay, hey ay, ay
Anyway the wind's blowin'

How much do you go to be gone?
You are any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows in

Don't wanna come down too low
Any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows in

Don't wanna come down
Do you know the way
To be in one place but stay?
Any way the wind's blowin'
Any way the wind's blowin'
