While strolling through the woods
Not so far from town
I got real shook
I heard the strangest sound

I saw the Purple People Eater
And to my surprise
I saw the Witch Doctor sittin' by his side

Woah!
The Witch Doctor had a guitar in his hand
They were boppin' and a-rockin'
With a two-piece band

Well the Purple was a blowin'
Like a People Eater should
The Witch Doctor picked
Like a Johnny B. Goode

They went
(Oh ee
Oh ah ah
Ting tang
Walla walla bing bang)

Yeah, the Doctor got trouble
When the People Eater said
"The girls keep a-laughin'
At the horn in my head"

Then the Witch Doctor smiled
And I heard him say
(Yeah man, you're ugly
But you sure can play)

Well there in the moonlight
It seemed so strange
While he played a little chorus of
Home on the Range

They were comin' in strong
Like a rock n' roll star
With the craziest beat
This side of Mars

They went
(Oh ee
Oh ah ah
Ting tang
Walla walla bing bang)

Yeah, these cats from outer space
They were givin' it all
I could tell the way they jumped it
They were havin' a ball

They had me pattin' my feet
And just a-clappin' my hands
They stopped just long enough to say
(Crazy man)

Yeah
Twilight time
When the sun goes down
Way back up in the woods
Along the edge of town

Yeah, the people all gather
From a-miles around
To hear Doc and Ol' Purple with that crazy sound

They went
(Oh ee
Oh ah ah
Ting tang
Walla walla bing bang)

One more time
(Okay)

(Oh ee
Oh ah ah
Ting tang
Walla walla bing bang)

(Wait til they see us on the Bandstand
Crazy man, crazy
Walla walla bing bang)

(Ha ha ha ha)
