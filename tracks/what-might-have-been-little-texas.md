Sure I think about you now and then
But it's been a long, long time
Well I've got a good life now, I moved on
So when you cross my mind
I try not to think about what might have been
Cause that was then and
We have taken different roads
We can't go back again
There's no use giving in
And theres no way to know
What might have been

We can sit and talk about this all night long
And wonder why we didn't last
Yes, they might be the best days we will ever know

But we'll have to leave them in the past
So try not to think about what might have been
Cause that was then
And we have taken different roads
We can't go back again
There's no use giving in
And there's no way to know

What might have been
Same old look in your eyes,
It's a beautiful night
I'm so tempted to stay
But too much time has gone by
We should just say goodbye

And turn and walk away
Try not to think about what might have been
Cause that was then and we have taken diffeerent roads
We can't go back again
Tthere's no use giving in
And there's no way to know
What might have been
No we'll never know
What might have been.
