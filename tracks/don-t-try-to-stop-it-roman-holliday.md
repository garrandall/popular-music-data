Don't try to stop it
Don't try to stop it
Don't try to stop it
Don't try to stop it

Driving out in the morning light
Tapping a beat on the wheel
The radio's broken but I don't mind
It's just the way I feel

We're driving out on a motorway tonight
On a ten stop
One star
Three chord wonderland
Don't try to stop it
Don't try to stop it
Don't try to stop it
Don't try to stop it

I ain't been home all week
Or changed my shirt today
I ain't stopped singing
The phone keeps ringing
Soon be on my way

We're driving out on a motorway tonight
On a ten stop
One star
Three chord wonderland
Don't try to stop it
Don't try to stop it
Don't try to stop it
Don't try to stop it

And all I see is night
And endless motorways
Pizzas and people
But I'm bored on my free days

Don't try to stop it
Don't try to stop it

Got a call from a girl last night
I had to tell her no
It's not that I don't want her here
But I've gotta go

We're driving out on a motorway tonight
On a ten stop
One star
Three chord wonderland
Don't try to stop it
Don't try to stop it
Don't try to stop it
Don't try to stop it

Don't you try to stop it
Don't you try to stop it
Don't try to stop it
Don't try to stop it
