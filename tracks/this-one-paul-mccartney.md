This one, this one, this one
This one, this one...


Did I ever take you in my arms, look you in the eye
Tell you that I do?
Did I ever open up my heart
And let you look inside?


If I never did it, I was only waiting
For a better moment that didn't come
There never could be a better moment
Than this one, this one
The swan is gliding above the ocean
A god is riding upon his back
How calm the water and bright the rainbow
Fade this one to black


Did I ever touch you on the cheek, say that you were mine
Thank you for the smile?
Did I ever knock upon your door
Try to get inside?


If I never did it, I was only waiting
For a better moment that didn't come
There never could be a better moment
Than this one, this one
The swan is gliding above the ocean
A god is riding upon his back
How calm the water and bright the rainbow
Fade this one to black


What opportunities did we allow to flow by
Feeling like the timing wasn't quite right?
What kind of magic might have worked if we had stayed calm?
Couldn't I have given you a better life?


Did you ever take me in your arms, look me in the eye
Tell me that you do?
Did I ever open up my heart
Let you look inside?


If I never did it, I was only waiting
For a better moment that didn't come
There never could be a better moment
Than this one, this one
The swan is gliding above the ocean
A God is riding upon his back
How calm the water and bright the rainbow
Fade this one to black


This one is gliding, oh
A God is riding, oh
How calm the water
How calm the water and bright the rainbow
