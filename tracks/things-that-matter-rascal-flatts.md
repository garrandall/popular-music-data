Sometimes he lets that boss get in his head
He canât see past that mountain of deadlines on his desk
Five oâclock heâs that last one out of the gate
And he gets cut off flipped off ticked off out on the interstate
And he wonders why this world wonât leave him alone
Till he hears that little voice holler âdaddyâs homeâ
Things that matter
Things that donât

Sheâs held on to that grudge all her life
Had thirty years of anger
Since her dad walked out that night
She thinks of all the moments that heâs missed
All the birthdays ballets first dates
That seems too much to forget
She gets that call that said he donât have long
She walks in
He starts crying
The past is gone
Things that matter
Things that donât

Time ainât on my side
Donât want to leave this world
With why didnât I?
Why didnât I?
Yeah why didnât I?

Sometimes I take on this world by myself
Thinking I got all the answers
Donât need anybodyâs help
Well God was right there waiting for me all along
To fall down on my knees surrender all
Things that matter
Things that donât
Things that matter
Things that donât
