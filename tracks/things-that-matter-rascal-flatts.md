Sometimes he lets that boss get
In his head
He can't see passed that mountain
Of deadlines on his desk
Five o'clock, he's the last one
Out of the gate
And he gets cut off, flipped off, ticked off
Out on the interstate
And he wonders why this world won't
Leave him alone
Til he hears that little voice holler
Daddy's home


Things that matter
Things that don't


She's held on to that grudge
All her life
And thirty years of anger
Since her dad walked out that night
She thinks of all the moments
That he's missed
All the birthdays, ballets, first dates
It seems too much to forget
She gets that call that said he
Don't have long
She walks in, he starts crying
The past is gone


Things that matter
Things that don't


Time ain't on our side
Don't wanna leave this world
With why didn't I, why didn't I
Yeah, why didn't I
Sometimes I take on this world
By myself
Thinking I got all the answers
Don't need anybody's help
When God was right there waiting
For me all along
To fall down on my knees
Surrender all


Things that matter, things that don't
Things that matter, things that don't
