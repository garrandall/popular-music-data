Sugarpie, honeybunch
You know that I love you
Lord, I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else

In and out my life
You come and you go
Just leaving your picture behind
And I've kissed it a thousand times

When you snap your fingers
Or wink your eye
I come running to you
I'm tied to your apron strings, woman
And there is nothing that I can do

Sugarpie, honeybunch
I'm weaker than a man should be
Lord, Lord, I can't help myself
I'm a fool in love, you see
Hey, hey, hey, babe

I wanna tell you
I don't love you, woman
Tell you that we're through
And I've tried, pretty baby
Every time I see your face
I get all choked up inside

When I call your name, girl
It starts the flame
Burning in my heart
Tearing it all apart
No matter how I try
My love, I cannot hide
Log on to Top40db

Sugarpie, honeybunch
You know that I love you, baby
Lord, I can't help myself
I'm a fool in love, you see

When you snap your fingers
Or wink your eye
I come running to you
Lord, I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else

Oh, Sugarpie, honeybunch
You know that I'm weak for you, baby
Good God, I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else
