I let the pain just walk on in
And I pulled up the nearest chair
No need to say 'Hey how you been'
We've been friends to long to care
Baby you're the cause of my sleepless nights
But it's not that I'm about to complain
You get used to it, sing your blues to it
Once a fool always a fool
There's no way to change to be rearranged anymore
Once a fool always a fool
When you ring the bell I can tell who you're ready for
I always find you with an alibi
When I know you're the guilty one
I never ask for a reason why
You come home with the rising sun
What the use of making it harder boy
When it's hard enough already for me
Be it right or wrong I shall play along
Once a fool always a fool
There's no way to change to be rearranged anymore
Once a fool always a fool
When you ring the bell I can tell who you're ready for
Once a fool always a fool
There's no way to change to be rearranged anymore
Once a fool always a fool
When you ring the bell I can tell who you're ready for
