Ooh yeah

I love the way you wear those worn out blue jeans
Walkin' all around in the big sunshine
Baby, let me believe that you're perfect
At least for a little while

And you don't have to tell me what you're thinkin'
You can keep all that to yourself
Baby, we got such a good thing goin'
Don't show me that your someone else

'Cause I'm actin' as if this blue skies
Never gonna rain down on me
I'm tellin' myself this true love's
Never gonna leave me lonely

Unless there's something I've missed
I'm actin' as if
(As if, as if, as if)
(As if, as if, as if)

We don't have to have this conversation
Baby, don't you think it's going fine
We don't need to send out invitations
To tell the world that you're mine

'Cause I'm actin' as if this blue skies
Never gonna rain down on me
I'm tellin' myself this true love's
Never gonna leave me lonely

Unless there's something I've missed
I'm actin' as if

As if your sweet kiss is never gonna fade away
And the way you look at me will never change
'Cause I love the way you wear those worn out blue jeans
Walkin' all around in the big sunshine

'Cause I'm actin' as if this blue skies
Never gonna rain down on me
I'm tellin' myself this true love's
Never gonna leave me lonely

I'm actin' as if this blue skies
Never gonna rain down on me
I'm tellin' myself this true love's
Never gonna leave me lonely

Unless there's something I've missed
Unless there's something I've missed
I'm actin' as if

(As if, as if, as if)
Ooh yeah
(As if, as if, as if)
Oh I'm actin' as if
(As if, as if, as if)
(As if, as if, as if)
