The first time I met the Devil was at a Motel 6
She left Hell to spend a weekend on Earth just for kicks
Sexy little bitch, shorter than expected
About five-foot five big an' thick in the breast and thighs
Beautiful, dark eyes a strong stare
Large lips, soft hands and long hair
I said Ill make you smile for the simple fact Im good at it
Ill make you smile just so I can sit and look at it,


I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you 
And I will love you through simple and the struggle
But girl you gotta understand the modern man must  hustle

Who cares what Jane says
She always spits the same spit
Id rather kill the radio and listen to the rain hit
Little sister needs seclusion
Somehow she'll discover it through the pop music
Got used to the feeling of falling
But you'll never see her following
Bouncing back and forth between the healing and the hollering
Riding the outer ring of your own private saturn
Thoughts scattered all across the grey matter

Little baby doll, she doesnt know what to say to yall
The patience is short and of course the pride is way too tall
Break it all smash the past like it was made of glass
Aint no other way to make it last
It hurts to watch Lucy lose the dream
Ive had the pleasure of seeing our hero kick and scream
And when she calms down Ill turn the sound down
And put my arms around the little lost and found
And Ill tell her that



Hush little lady dont say a word
All the rest of the village gonna know your disturbed
And if you let em know that your vulnerable
Then there aint no stoppin (high) before they open you slow
Im a chapter in you text book
Read me like a check book
Mistook love at first sight for a sex look
Enough of the blind mans bluff
I want the good stuff
Trying to hook up a full belly and a foot rub
The moderns man hustle, i dig it I shovel
Feed me ya troubles and need me to cuddle
Bundle up in my mitten and coat
As cold as it get Ill keep your winter afloat
So let the snow fall (its comin down)
She doesnt want to understand why I still come around
She look at the mirror she dont see what I see
She holds no history of how precious she be
Lay your head on my chest speak of this stress
Kick your feet up and rest before we clean up the nest
I hate to see you upset, it cramps the position 
And if you didnt know you better listen cause
