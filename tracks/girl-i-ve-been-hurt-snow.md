Girl I've been hurt
Girl I've been hurt


You said there will be no other love
But me but girl I know much better
I'm no fool; you've been playing games on me
Come here tell me what you're thinking of (of)
Is he real, have you found another love?
How long must we play this masquerade?


Girl I've been hurt now I need another lover
You are no'
Girl I've been hurt now I need another lover
You are no'
Girl I've been hurt now I need another lover
You are no good


Who do you think you are?
Let me tell ya about it
Who do you think you are?
Girl is there something you should tell me
Cause you've been acting kinda strange lately
But I already know what's been going on
I'm in love but love it doesn't blind me
Now I'm moving on and leaving you behind me baby
I have to go I just can't take it any more


Girl I've been hurt now I need another lover
You are no'
Girl I've been hurt now I need another lover
You are no'
Girl I've been hurt now I need another lover
You are no good


Love this girl me say love this girl
Love this girl me say love this girl
Don't you know say Daddy me Snow
Give her diamond and pearl
Give this girl me say diamond and pearl
Love her in my heart me say down to belly
He say Daddy me snow me are the cooler daddy
Me love this girl but she left me lonely
Love this girl now she left me lonely
She want go play with me heart, bye bye bye
She want go play with me heart, bye bye bye
Find another lover me say find another one
Find another lover me say find another one
To make me feel fine
Make me feel fine
Make me feel fine lord


Girl I've been hurt now I need another lover
You are no'
Girl I've been hurt now I need another lover
You are no'
Girl I've been hurt now I need another lover
You are no good
