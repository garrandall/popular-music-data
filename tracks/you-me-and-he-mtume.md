There's somethin' I want to say
Try and understand
There's another in my life
He's my lover and I'm your wife

You, me and he
What we gonna do, baby
You, me and he
What we gonna do, baby

I was too blind, blind to see
I never thought, never thought it could happen to me
Then I knew (yeah) things had changed
'Cause when we made love, you called out his name

So much tension
'Cause we're livin' a lie by and by
Whoa, whoa, whoa, not to mention
Can we give it a try

The truth's so, so very hard to say, oh baby
This pain I feel grows each day
Can we find a way

So much tension
'Cause we're livin' a lie by and by
Whoa, whoa, whoa, not to mention
Can we give it a try

You, me and he
What we gonna do, baby
You, me and he
What we gonna do, baby

You, me and he
What we gonna do, baby
You, me and he
What we gonna do, baby
I don't want to let you go
No, no, no, no
