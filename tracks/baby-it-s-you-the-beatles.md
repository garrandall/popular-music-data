Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la


It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
(Sha la la la la)
It's not the way you kiss that tears me apart


Uh, oh, many, many, many nights go by
I sit alone at home and I cry over you
What can I do?
Can't help myself

'Cause baby, it's you (Sha la la la la la la)
Baby, it's you (Sha la la la la la la)
(Sha la la la la)


You should hear what they say about you, "cheat," "cheat"
(Sha la la la la)
They say, they say you never never never ever been true
(Cheat cheat)


Uh oh
It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm going to love you any old way
What can I do? And it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody

'Cause baby, it's you (Sha la la la la la la)
Baby, it's you (Sha la la la la la la)




Uh oh
It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do? When it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody

'Cause baby, it's you (Sha la la la la la la)
Baby, it's you (Sha la la la la la la)


Don't leave me all alone (Sha la la la la la la)
Come on home (Sha la la la la la la)
'Cause baby, it's you
