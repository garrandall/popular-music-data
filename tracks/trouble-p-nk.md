No attorneys to plead my case
No opiates to send me into outer space
And my fingers are bejeweled
With diamonds and gold
But that ain't gonna help me now


I'm trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble y'all
I disturb my town
I'm trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble y'all
I got trouble in my town


You think you're right
But you were wrong
You tried to take me
But I knew all along
You can take me
For a ride
I'm not a fool out
So you better run and hide


I'm trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble y'all
I got trouble in my town
I'm trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble y'all
I got trouble in my town


If you see me comin'
Down the street
Then you know it's time to
Go (and you know it's time to go 'cause here comes trouble)


No attorneys to plead my case
No opiates to send me into outer space
And my fingers are bejeweled
With diamonds and gold
But that ain't gonna help me now


You think you're right
But you were wrong
You tried to take me
But I knew all along
You can take me
For a ride
Cause I'm not a fool out
So you better run and hide


I'm trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble y'all
I disturb my town
I'm trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble y'all
I got trouble in my town


So if you see me comin'
Down the street
Then you know it's time to
Go (go-oh-oh, I got)


Trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble y'all
I got trouble in my town
I'm trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble y'all
I got trouble in my town


I'm trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble y'all
I got trouble in my town
I'm trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble y'all
I got trouble in my town
Yeah, yeah
I got trouble in my town
Yeah, yeah
I got trouble in my town
Yeah, yeah
