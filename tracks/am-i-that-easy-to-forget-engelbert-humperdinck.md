They say you've found somebody new,
But that won't stop my loving you.
I just can't let you walk away,
Forget the love I had for you.

Guess I could find somebody new,
But I don't wan't no one but you.
How can you leave without regret?
Am I that easy to forget?

Before you leave be sure you find
You want his love much more than mine.
'Cause I'll just say we've never met,
If I'm that easy to forget.

They say you've found somebody new,
But that won't stop my loving you.
How could you leave without regret?
Am I that easy to forget?

Guess I could find somebody new,
But I don't wan't no one but you.
How can you leave without regret?
Am I that easy to forget?
