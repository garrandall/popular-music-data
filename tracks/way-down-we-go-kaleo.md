Oh, father tell me, do we get what we deserve?
Oh, we get what we deserve

And way down we go
Oh, way down we go
Say, way down we go
Way down we go

Whoa, you let your feet run wild
Time has come as we all go down
Yeah but for the fallâoh, myâ
Do you dare to look them right in the eyes?

'Cause they will run you down, down 'til the dark
Yes, and they will run you down, down 'til you fall
And they will run you down, down to your core
Yeah, 'til you can't crawl no more

And way down we go
Way down we go
Say, way down we go

'Cause they will run you down, down 'til you're caught
Way down we go

Whoa, baby, yeah
Whoa, baby
Baby
Way down we go
Yeah

And way down we go
Way down we go
Say, way down we go
Way down we go
