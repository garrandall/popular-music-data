There was a tall oak tree
That loved a babblin brook
And the babblin brook
Loved the mountain high
And the mountain high
Loved the sky above
The Creator looked down
And saw everything was love, love, love
No, he took a bone
And a piece of mud --
He made a man and a woman
To be flesh and blood
And then along came the devil
Up out of the ground --
He tempted the woman
And that spread sin all round, all round, all round
Now, if she?d left that apple
On that apple tree
There?d be no tears or sorrow
We?d live eternally
And then along came Man
And chopped the oak tree down
And now the babblin brook
Is solid ground
And now the mountain high
Don't stand so high
And there's a cloud of smoke
That covers up the clear blue sky
There was a tall oak tree
There was a tall oak tree
There was a tall oak tree
