Ooh, yeah, oooh, yeah, yeah

I can picture us in the living room
by the mantle piece
and youâre telling me youâre loving me
with your hands on my thighs
while Iâm staring in your brown eyes
and the expression on your face
is telling me you want more than a taste
so tonight weâre going all the way
weâll be loving till the break of day


Thereâs nothing in this world I wouldnât do for you boy
I donât care what the others say now that I got you babe
No one can bring me joy like you girl
All the little things you do
Its all about you boo

I can picture us running in the rain
After a movie then we spark a flame
Oh I love it when you scream my name
Going 60 in the 3rd lane
We pull over to the parking lot
In the Park that's my favorite spot
Doing just about anything
Weâll be going till the birds sing



I think its bout time that I make you mine
Oh what your saying to me boy come on break it down
To find another like you will be a lifetime
I think I see where youâre going baby let it out let it out
Listen to me baby got something to say
Is it really what I think donât take all day
Forever is what I wanna give to you so what do you say
Baby I do
