And the man keeps sayin' 'Do you take this woman
To be your awful wedded wife?' Heh, heh

And then I started thinkin' about no more winkin'
At the pretty little gals a-boppin' by
No more dancin' and new romancin'
Lord, it made me want to sit down and cry
Aw, no pool shootin' and a rootin' and a-tootin'
With the boys if I take you for my wife
I can't go no place, I gotta look at your face
For the rest of my dog gone life
This is it!

Ah, honey, what am I doin' here in the first place?
You knooooooow I don't go for this marraige bit!
I was only kiddin'! Hahahahahahaha
And there's your daddy sittin' over there with a shotgun
Layin' across his lap
And a big smile on his ugly face
And the man keeps sayin' 'Are you gonna take this woman or aintcha?'

Well, then I started thinkin' about no more winkin'
At the pretty little gals a-boppin' by
No more dancin' and new romancin'
Lord, it made me want to sit down and cry
Aw, no pool shootin' and a rootin' and a-tootin'
With the boys if I take you for my wife
I can't go no place, I gotta look at your face
For the rest of my dog gone life
This is it!

Honey, what's this jazz about Love, Honor, and Obey?
That cat's talkin' to me! Heheheh
And look at all these good lookin' bride maids standin' around, heh
Hellllllo, baaaby!
And the man in charge keeps sayin' 'Looky here
Do you take this woman or dontcha?'

Well, then I started thinkin' about no more winkin'
At the pretty little gals a-boppin' by
No more dancin' and new romancin'
Lord, it made me want to sit down and cry
Aw, no pool shootin' and a rootin' and a-tootin'
With the boys if I take you for my wife
I can't go no place, I gotta look at your face
For the rest of my dog gone life
This is it!

And the man keeps sayin' 'Look here, do you take this woman or dontcha?'
And I say 'Partnah, I don't believe I do. Let me outa here!
