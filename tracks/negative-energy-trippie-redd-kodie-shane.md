I love Trippie Redd
Oh, these hoes
I don't know about these hoes
What about me, though?
My life took a OD for them (Skrrt, skrrt)
Yeah, steady, yeah, yeah

Uh, feel like Steve-O
See a pussy nigga through the peephole
Hit him with the beam, though
Diamonds shine, hit him with the gleam, though
Came unlocked, no keyhole
50k on the teeth, ho
Bugatti with all the speed, though
Bet they won't find me like Nemo
Yeah, takin' that bitch straight to Mickey D's (For real)
She want a burger and 10-piece (For real)
Might catch a murder, it's tempting (For real)
Want everybody remember me (Yeah)
I aim at the head of a enemy
I swear, this lil' thottie, she into me
I'm takin' her soul and her energy

This shit, it just fill up my energy (Yeah)
Made me just feel like my enemy (Yeah)
I might just turn into my inner beast (Yeah)
Know we tote choppers, we in the streets (Yeah)
You niggas got fucked up energy (Fucked up energy)
Come on, big dawg, where you wanna meet?
(Dawg, where you wanna meet?)
Come on, big dawg, where you wanna meet?
(Dawg, where you wanna meet?)
Come on, big dawg, where you wanna meet?
(Dawg, where you wanna meet?)

Bitch, I'm the shit like my bustie
That little bitch is a bustie
That little bitch wanna fuck me
But that lil' bitch is too dusty
She prolly got crabs, she so crusty
I bet that lil pussy is pussy
Just the thought of that shit is disgusting
Off the wall, Humpty Dumpty


This shit, it just fill up my energy (Yeah)
Made me just feel like my enemy (Yeah)
I might just turn into my inner beast (Yeah)
Know we tote choppers, we in the streets (Yeah)
You niggas got fucked up energy (Fucked up energy)
Come on, big dawg, where you wanna meet?
(Dawg, where you wanna meet?)
Come on, big dawg, where you wanna meet? (Slatt)
(Dawg, where you wanna meet?)
Come on, big dawg, where you wanna meet?
(Dawg, where you wanna meet?)


Come on, big dawg, come be one of me
I know my demons are chasing me
Only lost once, it was in a dream
So I went and I run if it's chasin' me
Big body coupe, it looks like stars in the Patek, yeah
We could see the moon because the roof came off this shit, uh
Yeah, that's her best friend but I still wanna fuck again, yeah
I don't know why my demons keep following me again
Come on, big dawg, come be one of me (Yeah, yeah)
I don't fear none of my enemies
They want to steal all my energy


This shit, it just fill up my energy (Yeah)
Made me just feel like my enemy (Yeah)
I might just turn into my inner beast (Yeah)
Know we tote choppers, we in the streets (Yeah)
You niggas got fucked up energy (Fucked up energy)
Come on, big dawg, where you wanna meet?
(Dawg, where you wanna meet?)
Come on, big dawg, where you wanna meet?
(Dawg, where you wanna meet?)
Come on, big dawg, where you wanna meet?
(Dawg, where you wanna meet?)


Yeah, this a muhfuckin' love chopper, bitch
I'll shoot you in yo' muhfuckin' ass
Huh, what the fuck you thought?
You wanna fuck with rockets, you gotta put it in my pocket
Tell a broke ho stop it
I'm the plug to the muhfuckin' socket, ya dig?
Love Letter to You 3
Huh, big 14
Yeah, huh
Yeah, huh
Yeah, huh
Yeah, yeah, ah-ah-ah, yeah
I had to end this screamin', bitch
