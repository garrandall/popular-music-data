I've had a bad day
And nothing ever seems to go my way
I've got a heartache
Don't wanna think about it

And everytime I try to smile, I cry, so
I'll just hide my face
Get out of my way
Don't wanna talk about it

And I'll be fine
I just need some time


I'm hanging on today
And nothing's gonna stop me, anyway
I'm holding on, I'm strong
I'm the only one who can make it change
I don't wanna fight
I gotta live my life
I'm gonna make it alright
I'm hanging on and nothing's gonna stop me, anyway

I went the wrong way
But I'm not lost, it's a good mistake
I saw the day break
I'm gonna shout about it

Oh, and everytime I turn around
I find that, I'm alone again
I've had a bad day
I'm gonna laugh about it

And I'll be fine
I'm gonna be alright


I'm hanging on today (today, yeah)
And nothing's gonna stop me, anyway
I'm holding on, I'm strong (I'm strong)
I'm the only one who can make it change
I don't wanna fight
I gotta live my life
I'm gonna make it alright
I'm hanging on and nothing's gonna stop me,
Nothing's gonna stop me

When I get lonely
I feel like I'm floating
Nothing is real
I'm above it all
I'm above it
I'm above it all


I'm hanging on today
And nothing's gonna stop me, anyway
I'm holding on, I'm strong
I'm the only one who can make it change
I don't wanna fight
I gotta live my life
I'm gonna make it alright
I'm hanging on and nothing's gonna stop me, anyway

I've had a bad day
