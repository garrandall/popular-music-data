I met a gin-soaked barroom queen in Memphis
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride
She had to heave me right across her shoulder
Cause I just can't seem to drink it off my mind


It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues


I laid a divorcee in New York City
I had to put up some kind of a fight
The lady then she covered me with roses
She blew my nose and then she blew my mind


It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues


Strollin' on the boulevards of Paris
Naked as the day that I will die
The sailors, they're so charming there in Paris
But I just don't seem to sail you off my mind


It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues
