(He's gonna step on you again)
(He's gonna step on you again)
(He's gonna step on you again)

Hey rainmaker, come away from that man
You know he's gonna take away your promised land
Hey good lady, he just want what you got
You know he'll never stop until he's taken the lot

Gonna stamp out your fire
He can change your desire
Don't you know that he can
Make you forget you're a man?

Gonna stamp out your fire
He can change your desire
Don't you know that he can
Make you forget you're a man?
You're a man, he's a man

Hey rainmaker, he got golden plans
I tell you he make you a stranger in your land
Hey good lady, he got God on his side
He got a double tongue, you'd never think that he'd lie

Gonna stamp out your fire
He can change your desire
Don't you know that he can
Make you forget you're a man?

Gonna stamp out your fire
He can change your desire
Don't you know that he can
Make you forget you're a man?
You're a man, he's a man

(He's gonna step on you again)
(He's gonna step on you again)
(He's gonna step on you again)

He's gonna step on you again
He's gonna step on you again
He's gonna step on you again
He's gonna step on you again
He's gonna step on you again
He's gonna step on you again
He's gonna step on you again

Hey rainmaker, come away from that man
You know he's gonna take away your promised land
Hey good lady, he got God on his side
He got a double tongue, you'd never think that he'd lie

Gonna stamp out your fire
He can change your desire
Don't you know that he can
Make you forget you're a man?

Gonna stamp out your fire
He can change your desire
Don't you know that he can
Make you forget you're a man?
You're a man, he's a man

(He's gonna step on you again)
(He's gonna step on you again)
(He's gonna step on you again)

He's gonna step on you again
He's gonna step on you again
He's gonna step on you again
He's gonna step on you again
He's gonna step on you again
He's gonna step on you again
He's gonna step on you again
