(He's gonna step on you again)
(He's gonna step on you again)
(He's gonna step on you again)
(He's gonna step on you again)

Hey rainmaker come away
From that man you know
He's gonna take away your promised land
Hey good lady

He just want what you got
You know he'll never stop
Until he's taken the lot

Gonna stamp out your fire
He can change your desire
Don't you know that he can make
You forget you're a man

Gonna stamp out your fire
He can change your desire
Don't you know that he can make
You forget you're a man

You're a man. He's a man
(He's gonna step on you again)
(He's gonna step on you again)
(He's gonna step on you again)
(He's gonna step on you again)

Hey rainmaker he got golden plans
I tell you he make you
A stranger in your land
Hey good lady

He got God on his side
He got a double tongue
You never think that he lie

Gonna stamp out your fire
He can change your desire
Don't you know that he can make
You forget you're a man

Gonna stamp out your fire
He can change your desire
Don't you know that he can make
You forget you're a man,
You're a man, he's a man

Hey rainmaker come away
From that man you know
He's gonna take away your promised land
Hey good lady

He got God on his side
He got a double tongue
You never think that he lie

Gonna stamp out your fire
He can change your desire
Don't you know that he can make
You forget you're a man

Gonna stamp out your fire
He can change your desire
Don't you know that he can make
You forget you're a man,
You're a man, he's a man
