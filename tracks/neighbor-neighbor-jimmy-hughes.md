Neighbor, neighbor, why you messin' in my life?
Neighbor, neighbor, you've been talkin' to my wife
Tellin' her you seen me
Runnin' wild the other night
Runnin' wild the other night
A neighbor, neighbor, theres's always one in every crowd
A neighbor, neighbor, tellin' lies and talkin' loud
You better watch your step now
You might fall off your cloud
You might fall off your cloud
Now I was walking down a dusty road
When along came a neighbor of mine
He saw me walkin' with my head hung down
He just had to stop and pass the time
Neighbor, neighbor, floatin' in the salty brine
Floatin' in the salty brine
