You only love me for my big sun glasses
And my Tony Lama's
And my Dodge Dart classic
You said "I'll be Johnny and you'll be June
I'll ride with you to the moon"
But guess what?


You can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken and the axle's draggin'
You can't step to this backyard swagger
You know it ain't my fault when I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like
Oh ah, oh, ah

Oh, heaven help me
I've been sowing wildflower seeds
And chasing tumble weeds
But that's just who I be
And you're just trying to slow this rolling stone
But I'm on to you baby
So guess what?


You can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken and the axle's draggin'
No you can't step to this backyard swagger
You know it ain't my fault when I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like
Oh ah, oh, ah

Oh, you only love me for my big sun glasses
And my Tony Lama's
I live in Oklahoma
And I've got long, blonde hair
And I play guitar, and I go on the road
And I do all the shit you wanna do
And my dog does tricks
And I ain't about drama, y'all
And I love my apron
But I ain't your mama!
So guess what?


You can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken and the axle's draggin'
No you can't step to this backyard swagger
You know it ain't my fault when I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like
Oh ah, oh, ah
Oh, yeah. Ah. Oh. Ah!
