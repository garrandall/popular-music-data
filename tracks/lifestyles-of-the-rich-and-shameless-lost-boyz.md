Everybody's buckin', don't give a damn
Everybody's, everybody's, everybody's
Everybody's buckin', don't give a damn
Everybody's, everybody's, everybody's
Everybody's buckin', don't give a damn
Everybody's, everybody's, everybody's
Everybody's buckin', don't give a damn
Everybody's, everybody's, everybody's

Straight from cop killer Queens, a juvenile named Jack
At the age of 17, yo this kid Jack started slingin' crack
He's on the road to the riches, baggin' bitches
He's in clubs takin' pictures, trigger finger always itches
His lifestyle is buck wild, honey child
Got a shorty named Val, she stays on the Isle
He started slingin' at the age of 17
His heart's made of steel, kid his minds full of green
He got his first ounce, made a grand 400
Three bills to get fresh, the other bills to be blunted
And wit' the letter G, he bought the letter O
The next thing you know, man he's rakin' in the dough
He put his peoples down, 'cause hey that's only right
For dem to get keys, dem and dem is mad tight
Set-up organation, organized on the block
Nobody's slingin' on the block, ayo, we got this block on lock

And it's the lifestyles of the rich and shameless
Some die wit' the name, some die nameless
It's all the same game, it's all the same pain
It's all the same pain, it's all the same game

The lifestyles of the rich and shameless
Some die wit' the name, some die nameless
It's all the same game, it's all the same pain
It's all the same pain, it's all the same game

The verse 2's about this girl named Yvette
She lives out in Queens, pushed a red Corvette
She's pumpin' weight in and outta state
Outta state license plate
See her lifestyle is straight weight
She's into lickin' shots
Stickin' blocks gotta shorty on the team
Shortie's into pickin' locks
Makin' G's, takin' trips cross seas
Just enough to be flashin', cash they be stashin'
She's wit' the cats, they love packin' gats
Bulletproof vest, bulletproof baseball hats
Her and the crew stay right, gettin' high too
Lex Coups and Jeeps, got peeps down on Guy Brew
It's all the same shame, just a different name
Shorty's sniffin' cane, just to maintain'

Then one night, shorty rock O-D'd (Shorty, why you O-D?)
Dawg, bring me the chorus (Shoulda chilled)
Pass me some trees, sista (I would pass the weed)

The lifestyles of the rich and shameless
Some die wit' the name, some die nameless
It's all the same game, it's all the same pain
It's all the same pain, it's all the same game

The lifestyles of the rich and shameless
Some die wit' the name, some die nameless
It's all the same game, it's all the same pain
It's all the same pain, it's all the same game

I used to hustle up on Linden and the Van
Me and my man did that thing hand-to-hand
20 bills up, huh, plus a buck 20 sack a person
Time to rap, but yet the fiends kept comin' back
I'm tryin' to put my lifestyle in order
The game's mad deep, I keep my feet above the water
Caught a bid got a wife and kid
The name is hotter than a flame, so out the game I slid
So now I'm into makin' hits wit' my men
I hustle wit' my style, cook up works wit' my pen
Mr. Cheeks represent in the gutter
Freaky Tah, gettin' lai thats my brudda
In the game to hit you in the brain
And if I was cocaine believe it, I'm your main
Tally up it's the Lost Boyz crew an
Freaky Tah, Spigg Nice and Pretty Lou

It's the lifestyles of the rich and shameless
Some die wit' the name, some die nameless
It's all the same game, it's all the same pain
It's all the same pain, it's all the same game

The lifestyles of the rich and shameless
Some die wit' the name, some die nameless
It's all the same game, it's all the same pain
It's all the same pain, it's all the same game

Lifestyles of the rich and shameless
Some die wit' the name, some die nameless
It's all the same game, it's all the same pain
It's all the same pain, it's all the same game

The lifestyles of the rich and shameless
Some die wit' the name, some die nameless
It's all the same game, it's all the same pain
It's all the same pain, it's all the same game

Lifestyles of the rich and shameless
Some die wit' the name, some die nameless
It's all the same game, it's all the same pain
It's all the same pain, it's all the same game

The lifestyles of the rich and shameless
Some die wit' the name, some die nameless
It's all the same game, it's all the same pain
It's all the same pain, it's all the same game

Lifestyles of the rich and shameless
Some die wit' the name, some die nameless
It's all the same game, it's all the same pain
