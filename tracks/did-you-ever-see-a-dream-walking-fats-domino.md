Did you ever see a dream walking?
Well, I did
Did you ever hear a dream talking?
Well, I did

Did you have a dream thrill you
With "Will you be mine?"
Oh, it's so grand
And it's too, too divine!

Did you ever see a dream dancing?
Well, I did
Did a ever see a dream romancing?
Well, I did!

Did you see heaven right in your arms
Saying, "I love you, I do!"
Well, the dream that was walking
And the dream that was talking
The heaven in my arms was you
