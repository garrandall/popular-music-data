Baby, I need your good lovin'
Got to have your love right now, baby
So come and fill my empty arms
And make my life worthwhile

Because I'm not livin', baby
I only exist
I'll never laugh, I'll never smile no more
I don't care if I stay like this, because

Without the one you love, life is not worthwhile
Without your love, my dear, I'm like a motherless child
So come and fill my empty arms
And make my life worthwhile

When I feel that old hurt comin' on
I stop and cry like I'm cryin' (Right now)
People ask why would a grown man cry
I drop my head, and I sadly reply

Without the one you love, life is not worthwhile
Without your love, my dear, oh, I'm like a motherless child
So come and fill my empty arms
And make my life worthwhile

(Baby, I need your good lovin')
Sometimes I feel like the wanderer
(Got to have your love right now)
Searching for peace within
(Baby, I need your good lovin')
I need you, my darling
(Got to have your love right now)
Like a lost soul needs a friend

So come and fill my empty arms
Ooh, and fill my empty life

(Baby, I need your good lovin')
Nobody knows the emptiness I feel
(Got to have your love right now)
That I'm feelin'
(Baby, I need your good lovin')
Nobody knows the loneliness I feel
(Got to have your love right now)
And I feel it 'cause

Without the one you love, oh, life ain't worthwhile
Without your love, my dear, oh, I'm like a motherless child
So come and fill my empty arms
And make my life worthwhile

Because without the one you love, oh, life is not worthwhile, no, no
Without the one you love, life ain't worthwhile
