You're not for real, you're just playing
I don't believe a word you're saying
Who you think you fooling?
What you think you're doing?
What you really working for?
You not really one of us
It's you you're really hurting
What's really your purpose?
What you really living for?
Don't you wanna be one of us?
I know you must be afraid
What's after the grave
Do you know what you've been searching for?
Who you really working for?
I know you must be scared
Feel like nothing's there
What you really living for?
Don't you wanna be one of us?


I'm so fresh up on it
Me and my clique like a metronome is
Pride on top like tetesteroni
Ain't cool when you fall like November for homeless
But that's none of my business I'mma sip this soda
Wait, I don't drink soda
If my pee stay yellow it's 'cause my kidneys are golden
Prolly too optimistic
But that's the only part that I can see like Moses
Sitting in my bedroom watching anime
Have you ever seen a party where they playing patty cake?
I can eat the patty cake and throw it up all in your face
And disregard the fact that I don't care what mom and daddy say
The stuff I think about is deeper than a twenty foot vase
With an old man inside sitting down playing bass
When he hits the notes right he makes the place vibrate
He doesn't wanna leave he likes the way it feels when he plays
I know a chick name Myrtle
Her favourite colour purple
She told me God hates her cause he didn't make her fertile
She used to always say she understands that she's not perfect
But she's still a sweet girl why do people just desert her?
Know a chick named Mariah
She always wore designer
Don't ask her how she got it cause she don't need a reminder
But when it come to church I guarantee you never find her
'Cause she felt she wasn't worth it and that made her suicidal
Knew a girl named Anita
Always getting misdemeanours
Said she's sick of always dealing with these crooked hearted people
Anyone who ever knew her knew she really wasn't evil
But the only guy she ever loved was on drugs and beat her
Had a bad one named Sarah
Used to love laughter
She only believed in God cause her daddy was a pastor
Insecure as a clown with way too much mascara
And I really felt bad cause she really was attractive
Kid named William
Alone in the building
Never felt he did belong with all the other children
He thought he had some friends but he always had suspicions
Anytime he played the field he would always get bitten
But he still cared about the way that they were living
Felt that they would perish if they didn't see his vision
Conversations with the crickets cause they guaranteed they'd listen

I know you must be afraid
What's after the grave
Do you know what you've been searching for?
Who you really working for?
I know you must be scared
Feel like nothing's there
What you really living for?
Don't you wanna be one of us?

Whoever's still listening to this
Y'all, y'all my best friends straight up

This a song that I'll prolly never perform live, no
This a song that I'll prolly never perform live
This a song that I'll prolly never perform live
'Cause I'd be embarrassed by the look I see in your eyes
But at you least you'll understand that I never wore a disguise
So you can't say you were surprised

First of all, forget anyone who thinks that they know me
The old me died some years ago with super swag ENT
When it was TrillWill, Hatakilla, TJ and Dee
Before TJ got on Instagram and called my momma a B
They say that people change in college so they can be apart
I don't think they really change they just become who they really are
Ain't not Mom and Dad to regulate everything you do
Ain't gone make you go to church, God gotta be real to you
And honestly there's not a single thing that's really wrong with that
It's all a part of growing up and there's never really going back
'Cause you and I both know it's something's that our folks will never get
There scared because they know it too our generations are way too gapped
I'm working on staying respectful when receiving advice that's not really helpful
You got your masters degree, okay well that's really not special
You working for another person who prolly ain't never met you
It's room full of iPhones and you showed up with a pencil
But let me shut up my mouth is always gon' get me in trouble
I'm always speaking out loud I used to get spanked when I mumbled
Be careful who you call slow, just know that tortoise is coming
I'm being humble and lying, it's way too wild in this jungle
Thank you for listening, I appreciate you bumping this
But Greenbeans is still the best project that I ever did
If you disagree then you probably gon' follow all the trends
Give it five years or so and everything gon' make sense
All I did was give 'em what they wanted to hear
I got 'em hollering Free Barabbas, know my message is clear
But I'm still TeamGMG for my day ones that was with me
And still remember when my dreadlocks wasn't even touching my ears
And my goal was never to get a bunch of people to follow me
I know a lot of people only waiting for the lottery
You never really understood you ain't gotta lie to me
I'm done tryna show my vision to people who ain't tryna see

I'm screaming this a song that I'll prolly never perform live
Oh my God
This a song that I'll prolly never perform live, no
This a song that I'll prolly never perform live, 'cause I'd be embarrassed by the look I see in your eyes
But at you least you'll understand that I never wore a disguise
So you can't say you were surprised

Uno number one
I guess I'm tryna be the best ever
The thoughts I think are too clever
I'm lying, I ain't nothing special
'Cause honestly I'm more self-conscious
Than a freshman in college
Who spends her money on clothes and shoes
Hoping she gets acknowledged
By an upper class man who's only with her for the pounding
Then he graduates and separates as he makes the announcement
She begins to cry then finds another guy she thinks is solid
But he's only with her 'cause well you know he heard about her
So he plays his part well, buys her roses and the violets
And all the assorted chocolates then he makes his deposit
When it's time for withdrawal he be moving with the silence
He didn't even save her number and his Instagram was private
So now she in her dorm room with the weeping and the crying
Only to be consoled by her roommate named Maya
Maya said she should pledge something to reignite her fire
So to keep it on the low so they don't know she keeps it quiet
So a few months later she crosses feeling enlightened
But inside she still knows them letters can't cover her mileage
But ignores the knowledge cause an athlete wanna try her
The never ending repetition of the same old cycle
Oh my God

This a song that I'll prolly never perform live, no, no, no, no, no
This a song that I'll prolly never perform live, uh

Rapper or a politician, I should've thought twice
'Cause I gotta shake hands and smile with people I really don't like
And I'm tryna reassure myself inside like it'll be alright
It's only been some months how could y'all be fake ya whole life
And I finally realized I'm not a Christian rapper
That was just a title that was made up to keep some people happy
Cause I can walk the walk and talk like this to please the chatty pattys
But I still like to use slang, wear gold, and my hair is nappy
I'm still gon' clap on two and four
I'm still gon' boogie through the door
I'm still gon' watch the way I walk so my jays don't crease up at the toes
I'm still gon' put on all this gold
I'm still gon' let you know I'm cold
I'm still gon' stunt in all my pictures
And I'm still gon' stop and strike a pose
You shouldn't have to change what God made
Just to go to a church
I understand we're not the same
But bruh, that ain't how it works
'Cause we can read the Bible
Word for word and quote every verse
But if we don't apply it in real life
Then tell me what was it worth
But I'mma transfer from a Baptist church
I'mma need all my credits
White out the dark blemishes
Hoping that I can still get accepted
Reject my brothers and my sisters
And act like I never met 'em
Just to be with Martha, Kate, Tanner, Jason, and Rebecca

Oh my God
This a song that I'll prolly never ever, never ever, never ever perform live
No, no, no, no
I'm so tired, so tired

No surprises if I told you I'd do it, I did it
This ain't a hobby I caught the body and got rid of the witness
No condemnation for those who in Jesus
I'm ignoring my flesh
Recognizing the importance of my spirit
I'm starting to get it
And people taking shots with a flat ball
They need to pick a side
I'm sick of seeing all these cat dogs
Lurking into my private life
They lookin' for a case to solve
But I guess they weren't big enough
Like a keyboard with the caps off
And as long people judge me
They gon' always get the facts wrong
And I'll beat every charge like a product with the tax off
And won't nobody say it
But they think I should wipe my black off
Don't have the spine to say it to my face
I suggest that you back off
I need to chill
I joke when I say things have been going real swell
This murder was premeditated if you still can't tell
Everything was planned and prayed for I sat back as time fell
More patience then a waiter with two plates and a silver barbell
A co-worker said, "Why you at this store if you got your degree?"
I looked at her and said, "Well that's only some insurance to me
I only got one 'cause stats say that a black man can't
But it has nothing to do with will or whether or not I'll succeed"
'Cause I refuse to work Monday through Friday 8-5 in the evening
Where the only thing I look forward to is being off on the weekends
All in hopes to be promoted just to sit in longer meetings
And then retire and sit at home all day while I'm waiting on Jesus
You can call me stupid but Gazelle is not gon' do it
It's not my fault that God decided to make me better at music
I'll never forget when my boss said, "Oh you one of them dreamers"
And for a split second I thought that what I was doing was foolish
But then I snap back like, "Boy you tripping, what is you doing?"
The hardest thing about growing is that you can't feel the movement
I've been alone in this theatre for about six years
And they still look at me confused while I'm describing this movie
But anyways switching the subject to me and my feelings
I've been having a problem separating Aha from William
Hiding from the problem not knowing that the burden is me
It's just that Aha the version of me that I always wanted to be
He wears all black with Jordan's and gold chains and gold teeth
When all the cameras are all watching he just takes over the beat
He always knows what to say and he's not afraid when he speaks
But when it all goes away he just transforms back to me
Door closed, lights off, sitting on top of the rug
Hands dirty from everything that we done got from the mud
Most of it was never needed but it was done just because
He's in my head laughing like, "Ha ha ha boy they loving the thug"
And I laugh to myself as I look up above
This a song without a hook the whole time I was the drug
I tried to shake God's hand and he gave me a hug
Then He whispered in my ear it's all luh
Aha
Woo
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
(I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Yeah)

I learned you gotta watch who you kick it with
I learned you gotta watch who you kick it with
People say they real but they counterfeit
People say they real but they counterfeit
Jesus is who I'm rocking with
Jesus is who I'm rocking with
And I'm not ashamed to tell nobody
I'mma treat her like a queen
Even if she wanna be a
Even if she wanna be a
Even if she wanna be a
Even if she wanna be a
Even if she wanna be a
Even if she wanna be a
Even if she wanna be a
Even if she wanna be a thot
Sitting in my bedroom, talking to the mirror
Don't call me crazy, I know that I can hear Him
He said, "Why you change, what happened to your spirit?"
What happened to you? You used to be a real one"
You ain't gotta want me, you ain't gotta want me, 'cause they want me
You ain't gotta need me, you ain't gotta need me, they need me
You ain't gotta love me, you ain't gotta love me, they love me
You ain't gotta want me, you ain't gotta want me, 'cause they want me
You ain't gotta need me, you ain't gotta need me, they need me
You ain't gotta love me, you ain't gotta love me, they love me
