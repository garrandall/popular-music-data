Red light, green light
Everybody take a shot
Red light, green light
Give me everything you got
Red light, green light

Mister 305
Flo Rida and LunchMoney
Three Miami boys, you know what time it is


Give me the green light, oh yeah
Cause I'm ready to go
Let's have a good time, let's go
What you waiting for?
You only got one life, one life
And we gon' live it up
So give me the green light, give it to me
Cause I'm ready to go, oh, oh, oh
Wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, oh, oh
Cause I'm ready to go, oh, oh, oh
Wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, oh, oh
Give me the green light


I got the green light mami and you know what that means
That we could do anything, anything that you dream
I wanna make you ooh, ah, until you scream
And I practice what I preach, if you know what I mean
I'mma about that mami, yeah I got the key and I'mma lock that mami
Yeah, we can roll and I'mma rock that mami
I do what I say and say what I mean, now let me jump in between
I'm getting loose in this thing, like OJ the Juice in this thing
Feeling like Left Eye, boy, I burn the roof in this thing
I got all the women getting naked, feeling like Luke in this thing
Think it's a game
Now I got the green lit and the green right
All I need is, mami, for you to give me the green light
So I can run through it like an easy pass
Find the G-spot and step on the gas


Give me the green light, oh yeah
Cause I'm ready to go
Let's have a good time, let's go
What you waiting for?
You only got one life, one life
And we gon' live it up
So give me the green light, give it to me
Cause I'm ready to go, oh, oh, oh
Wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, oh, oh
Cause I'm ready to go, oh, oh, oh
Wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, oh, oh
(Ride out now, ride out now)
Give me the green light


Baby, I got the Midas, I'm Flo Rida
You know I'm all about that thing, that thing
If she ready then I'm ready
Pull up on her with the Chevy
Real talk when that light turn green (let go)
Give me what I ask for, I got a passport
Mister international, I hit the airport
If you knew the kind of work that I transport
That Rihanna do me dirt, took a crash course
I like the cleanest, greenest, leanest
Sabrina, Venus, Flo a Genius, smokin' Phoenix
You've never seen this, I have her dream this
That 200 on the dash, got me feenin
So I'm tryna ride out, slide out
Grab the stripes then the five hundred bye bye
Wild out, shot out
Bee hive, hit the honeycomb hideout, ay


Give me the green light
Cause I'm ready to go
Let's have a good time
(Right now, right now)
What you waiting for?
You only got one life
And we gon' live it up
So give me the green light, let's go
Cause I'm ready to go, oh, oh, oh
Wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, oh, oh
Cause I'm ready to go, oh, oh, oh
Wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, oh, oh
(Right now, right now)
Give me the green light


Red light, green light
Everybody take a shot
Red light, green light
Give me everything you got
Red light, green light
Everybody take a shot
Red light, green light
What you waiting for?


Give me the green light, oh yeah
Cause I'm ready to go
Let's have a good time, let's go
What you waiting for?
You only got one life, one life
And we gon' live it up
So give me the green light, give it to me
Cause I'm ready to go, oh, oh, oh
Wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, oh, oh
Cause I'm ready to go, oh, oh, oh
Wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, oh, oh
(Right now, right now)
Give me the green light
