Ride the wild one cowboy in the rodeo
Love like crazy juliet and romeo
Living only to consume
Bruising hearts collecting gloom
Seems no place to hide away
From the hammer and caress
Dress with passion
Fashion for the parking lot
Make some action
Pushing time out of the clock
Take away identity
Parcel up what's left of me
Water down the youthful drop
Call the sane insanity

All I want is to live with you
All I want is to cry with you

Dance til sunrise
Reggae til the cows come home
Fight the bigot
Champion you're not alone
I can sort of work things out
Juggling the fear and doubt
Even when it's watertight
In the end I have to say

All I want is to live with you
All I want is to cry with you

I can sort of work things out
Juggling the fear and doubt
Even when it's watertight
In the end I have to say I have to say

Ride the wild one cowboy in the rodeo
Love like crazy Juliet and Romeo
