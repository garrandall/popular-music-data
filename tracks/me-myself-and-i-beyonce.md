All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
Here you go, trippin'
Everything is cool between us Bey
I told you that
Out on the road with my people, just doin' what I gotta do
Thereâ€™s nothing going that shouldn't be goin' on
You gotta trust me, Ma


I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day having your kids
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong


I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time, but now I moved on
Because I realized I got


Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend


So controlling, you say that you love me, but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know, I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong


Now that it's over, stop calling me
Come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like you're still with me
All your homies know
Even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized I got


Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend


(Got me, myself, and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(So I have vowed to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again
(Now I've got me, myself, and I)
Hey, I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
I've cried
All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Hey!
Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(So I have vowed to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again


Yeah, -eah
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Whoo-oh
Whoo-oh-oh!


(Now I've got me, myself, and I)
Me, myself, and I
(I must have cried a thousand times)
I have cried so many times
(I can't regret time spent with you)
I can't regret time spent with you
(So I have vowed to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again
(Now I've got me, myself, and I)
Oh! I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
If you've cried a thousand times
Ladies, you will survive!
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah! You hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(So I have vowed to make it through)
I can see the sun shine
I got me, myself, and I
