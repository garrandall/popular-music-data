Hey!

I come home in the morning light,
My mother says "When you gonna live your life right?".
Oh, mother dear, we're not the fortunate ones.
No, mother dear, we're not the fortunate ones.

And girls they want to have fun.
Oh, girls just want to have fun.
Oh, girls they want to have fun.
Oh, girls just want to have..

That's all they really want,
That's all they really want,
That's all they really want,

That's all they really want,
That's all they really want,
That's all they really want.

That's all they really want.

The phone rings in the middle of the night,
Mha, my father yells "what you gonna do with your life?"
Oh, daddy dear, you know you're still number one.
Oh, daddy dear, you know you're still number one.

But girls they want to have fun (girls just want to have fun),
Oh, girls just want to have fun (girls just want to have fun),
Oh, girls just want to have fun (girls just want to have fun)
Oh, girls just want to have,

That's all they really want, 
That's all they really want,
That's all they really want,

That's all they really want,
That's all they really want, yeah,
That's all they really want.

And girls just want to have fun,
Oh girls just want to have fun,
Oh girls just want to have fun,
Oh girls just want to have..

That's all they really want,
That's all they really want,
That's all they really want,

That's all they really want,
That's all they really want,
That's all they really want.

Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world.
I want to be the one to walk in the sun
When the working day is done.
When the working day is done.
