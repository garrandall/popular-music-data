Well her face was not the face of an angel
But I saw an angel
And her eyes were not the eyes of a lady
But I was looking for a lady
So I saw a lady
That said

Boy get your head out of the stars above
You get the maximum pleasure from a minimum love
Save your heart and let your body be enough
To get the maximum pleasure from a minimum love

Well I knew that this was not as it should be
But then I thought how it could be
While I waited for my conscience to guide me
This voice I swore I heard inside me
It came from right beside me
It said

Boy get your head out of the stars above
You get the maximum pleasure from a minimum love
Save your heart and let your body be enough
To get the maximum pleasure from a minimum love

Boy get your head out of the stars above
You get the maximum pleasure from a minimum love
Save your heart and let your body be enough
To get the maximum pleasure from a minimum love
