Well, now me and Homer Jones and Big John Talley
Had a big crap game goin' back in the alley
And I kept rollin' them sevens, winnin' all them pots

My luck was so good, I could do no wrong
I just kept on rollin' and controllin' them bones
And finally they just threw up their hands and said
"When you hot, you hot", I said, "Yeah"

When you're hot, you're hot
And when you're not, you're not
Put all the money in an' let's roll 'em again
When you're hot, you're hot
La la la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la la, when you're hot, you're hot

Well, now every time I rolled them dice I'd win
And I was just gettin' ready to roll 'em again
When I heard somethin' behind me
I turned around and there was a big old cop

He said "Hello, boys", and then he gave us a grin an' said
"Look like I'm gonna hafta haul you all in
An' keep all that money for evidence"
I said, "Well, son when you hot, you hot", he said, "Yeah"

When you're hot, you're hot
And when you're not, you're not
You can 'splain it all down at City Hall
I say, yeah, when you're hot, you're hot
La la la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la la, when you're hot, you're hot

Well, when he took us in to court, I couldn't believe my eyes
The judge was a fishin' buddy that I recognized
I said, "Hey, judge, old buddy, old pal
I'll pay ya that hundred I owe ya, if you'll get me outta this spot"

So he gave my friends a little fine to pay
He turned around an' grinned at me an' said
"Ninety days, Jerry, when you hot, you hot"
An' I said, "Thanks a lot"

When you're hot, you're hot
And when you're not, you're not
He let my friends go free and throwed the book at me
He said, "Well, when you're hot, you're hot"

I said, "Well, I'll tell ya one thing, judge, old buddy, old pal
If you wasn't wearin' that black robe
I'd take out in back of this courthouse
And I'd try a little bit of your honor on"

"You understand that, you hillbilly?
Who gonna collect my welfare?
Pay for my Cadillac?
Whadda you mean 'Contempt of Court'?
Judge, oh, judge, judgie poo"
