I took a look in the mirror
And what did I see
For once in my life
I gave a lecture to me
Hey, lonely one
See what you've done
You thought you were smart, yeah
You thought it would be fun
Hey, lonely
I bet you're sorry now
Oh, yeah
So here you are standing
With tears in your eyes
Thought he'd never find ouy
You thought you were wise
Hey, lonely
Let me see you smile
Come on, you crave to be grown up
Now why you acting like a child
Hey, lonely
I bet you're sorry now
Oh, yeah
Your friends all say
You shoudn't care
Tell me, what do they know
About your love affair
Now you did the hurting, oh, yeah
And you played the game, come on
You did the cheating
While he took the blame
Hey, lonely, come on
Remember I love you
Every, eveything you've done
Oh, yeah, has come back to you
Hey, lonely
I bet you're sorry now
Oh, yes, you are
Hey, lonely one
I bet you're sorry now
Yeah, yeah
Hey, lonely one
I bet you're sorry now
