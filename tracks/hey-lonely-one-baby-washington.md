I'd like to dedicate this song to lovers
And the people, who forgot themselves somewhere along the way
I wanna remind them, that a man has to go back to the crossroads
Before he finds himself
I wanna know, that that goes deeper than the skin
It goes to the heart
I just wanna... I wanna thank God for the energy
Cause I'd like to say to everybody right here:

For your precious love means more to me
Than any love can ever be
For when I wanted you I was so lonely and so blue
And that's what love will do

And oh! And darling, they say that our love won't grow
But I just wanna tell 'em: they don't know
And as long as you're in love with me
Our love will grow stronger, deeper than any sea

And darling, all I want is that in this whole wide world
Is just for you to say, that you'll be my girl
And ooh... it makes me go while back, yeah
Back to the time I used to play at the Apollo Theater
The Riga, the Royal, and the Howard in Washington

I used to say: "Bewildered..."
And then I used to look at the first row
And I'd see a smiling face down there
And I'd say, I'd say... "Try me"

And then, somebody in the back would say
"What did Jackie say?", I'll say... I'll say
"Jackie said... Jackie said, one day he said: Aaaahh..."

God bless you, Jackie
You gave us so, so many, so many joyful, beautiful days
And there's sometime, when I walk down in South Carolina
I think about Chuck Jackson:
"Any day now, you will hear me say - goodbye my love"

'Cause I know, I know, I know the Famous Flames:
Bobby, Johnny, Baby Lloyd, they would say...
They would say, can you remember?
They would say: "I don't mind..."
Now I say "...your love"
But I wanna go back one more time, yeah
Please, let me go back
Let me finish, let me finish, and I wanna say...

For as long as you're in love with me
My love will go wider, deeper than any sea
And darling, darling, my my my my my my my...
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, oooh...

I gotta  now, and oh! Look out, 'cause here I come
I'll be in your town, your town, your town, your town, and your town
At my last number, I'll say:
"Please, please, please, hey, heeey! Please, please..."
