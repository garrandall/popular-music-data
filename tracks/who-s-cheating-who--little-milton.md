You kiss me off
To work in the morning
But it doesn't mean
That's where I'm going

And cause my meals are
Cooked when I return, baby
I want you to know
That doesn't mean
That's all you been doing

Cause I could be in the street
Playing the game and you
Could be at home doing
The same darn thing

Cause when you cheat
On a love that's true
Oh, tell me now
Who's cheating who

My nights out with the boys
Don't have to be
With the boys at all
And when you go to
Visit your mother, baby
Oh, yes, I know, her name
Could easily change to Paul

When someone gives you love
It's like money in the bank
But if you take another return
You've got to come up blank

Cause when you cheat
On a love that's true
Oh, tell me now
Who's cheating who

If you give up the good
For what's good maybe
If you steal the bread
That feeds your baby

If you ignore your love
And sleep right home
You gain more sleep
But your job might be gone

Oh, my nights out with the boys
Don't have to be
With the boys at all

And when you go to
Visit your mother, baby
I just wanna let you know
I know her name could
Easily change to Paul

When someone gives you love
It's like money in the bank
But if you take another return
You've got to come up blank

Cause when you cheat
On a love that's true
Oh, baby, now
Who's cheating who

I want you tell me now, baby
Who's cheating who, oh, yeah
I wonder if you know what
I'm talking about now
