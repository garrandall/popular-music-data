You so fucking precious when you smile
Hit it from the back and drive you wild


So tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise
Tell me where you love lies


Baby girl, what's your name
Let me talk to ya
Let me buy you a drank
I'm T-Pain, you know me
Konvict music, nappy boy, ooh wee


I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind, yeah


What goes around, goes around, goes around
Goes all the way back around


We found love right where we are


She said do you love me
I told her only partly
I only love ma bed and ma mama, I'm sorry


Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby


Gold jewellery shinin' so bright
Strawberry champagne all night
Lucky for you that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you that's what I like, that's what I like


You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over


You're in the friendzone now
Sorry but there's no way out


Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewellery on you


You only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow


Yeah, I'm on one
I said, I'm on one


Buddy you're a boy make a big noise
Playin' in the street gonna be a big man some day


Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof


And we can't stop
And we won't stop
We run things, things don't run we
Don't take nothing from nobody, yeah yeah


Gods plan
Gods plan
Yeah...
