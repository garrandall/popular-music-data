There's too much talking
And not enough said
Too many do’s and dont's
Messin' my head

Pretty pretty little girl
You know what I need
(Pretty pretty little girl
You know what I need)
Pretty pretty little girl
I need me some...

Beautiful in my day, yes
Some tenderness in my night
I need me some wonderful in my world, girl
I need me some you in my life

There’s too much motion
And not enough space
People are everywhere
Can't find a place

Pretty pretty little girl
You know what I need
(Pretty pretty little girl
You know what I need)
Pretty pretty little girl
I need me some...

Beautiful in my day, yes
Some tenderness in my night
I need me some wonderful in my world, girl
I need me some you in my life

Well I need... (me some beautiful)
I need me some... (need some wonderful)
I need me some you, yes I do
Need me some sunshine in my view
Honey, shadows have been my view
I need me some you

I need some
Beautiful in my day, yes
Some tenderness in my night
I need me some wonderful in my world, girl
I need me some you in my life

I need some
Beautiful in my day, yes
Some tenderness in my night
I need me some wonderful in my world, girl
I need me some you in my life
