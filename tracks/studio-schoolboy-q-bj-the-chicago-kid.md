I'm just sitting in the studio just tryna get to you, baby
But this song so fucking dope, girl, it's hard not for me to blaze it
To tell the truth, wish it was you in this booth that I was blazing
So, I'm just sitting in the studio just tryna get to you, baby


See I've been in the studio just tryna get to you, baby
All night laying verses though I'd rather lay with you, baby
Bra and panties matching, nail and toes, you were kinda lady
Angel out of Heaven, such a goddess have a nigga prayin'


I'm just sitting in the studio just tryna get to you, baby
But this song so fucking dope, girl, it's hard not for me to blaze it
To tell the truth, wish it was you in this booth that I was blazing
So, I'm just sitting in the studio just tryna get to you, baby


You need a real nigga shorty so come and
Throw that pussy shorty, see I think you and me can make it
This little verse to get you naked
See your heart ain't meant for breaking
Cupid's never been mistaken
See, I been caught up in the moment
Shit, my type ain't quite her type
But now this gangsta nigga on it
She can twist my weed and hit the 'yac
I can hit your type without the hat
Put that pussy on the map
I see qualities in a bad girl
I know that ass you got
Come with attitude and your swag, girl
You ain't wrong, girl
Just when that door knock lose your thong, girl
'Cause you girl, 'cause you girl, girl, 'cause you girl, girl


I'm just sitting in the studio just tryna get to you, baby
But this song so fucking dope, girl, it's hard not for me to blaze it
To tell the truth, wish it was you in this booth that I was blazing
So, I'm just sitting in the studio just tryna get to you, baby


Throw and loc your pussy, girl, you knowing that your nigga faded
Can I hit that pussy way I wanna while this record playin'?
Put my tongue in different places, play a game of operation
Na-na-na-nla-nla-la-la, you get what I'm sayin'
No metaphors, nothing like that
I'm keeping it straight to the point with you
So, I'mma put this dick up all inside of you


I'm just sitting in the studio just tryna get to you, baby
But this song so fucking dope, girl, it's hard not for me to blaze it
To tell the truth, wish it was you in this booth that I was blazing
So I'm just sitting in the studio just tryna get to you, baby


I'm just sitting in the studio just tryna get to you, baby
But this song so fucking dope, girl, it's hard not for me to blaze it
To tell the truth, wish it was you in this booth that I was blazing
So, I'm just sitting in the studio just tryna get to you, baby
