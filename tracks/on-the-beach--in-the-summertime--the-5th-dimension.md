On the beach in the summertime
Where the happenings are

On the beach
Baby, laying in the sand
You and me

Where the rat race and the city
Seems to fade away to memory
And the heartbroken lovers
Try to wash away their troubles

On the beach
With you and me

On a hot summer day
Yeah, baby, at the shore
(By the sea)
Yeah, yeah

On the beach
(On the beach)
In the summertime
Where the beautiful people

Still compete
Strolling on the boardwalk
By the sea

Where the flame of love can kindle
And the marriage plans can tremble
When two enchanted lovers
Get a good look at each other

On the beach
With you and me

On a hot summer day
Yeah, baby, at the shore
(By the sea)
By the sea

And the cleanness of the air
Seem to cleanse our souls by being there
And the heartaches we once knew
With all our cares and sorrows
Won't have worry till tomorrow

On the beach
With you and me

On a hot summer day
Yeah, baby, at the shore
(By the sea)
Yeah, by the sea

(On the beach)
Yeah, yeah
(On the beach)
Strolling
On the boardwalk
