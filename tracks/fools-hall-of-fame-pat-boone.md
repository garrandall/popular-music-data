Just hang my picture
In the fools hall of fame (the fools hall of fame) (the fools hall of fame)
That's where I belong 'cause I was so wrong
For letting you go, for letting you go

The world will see me
In the fools hall of fame (the fools hall of fame) (the fools hall of fame)
They'll stop and they'll say "He turned her away
When she loved him so" (when she loved him so) (when she loved him so)

Why did I break the truest heart beneath the sun?
There may be biggest fools than me but just name me one, just name me one

Till you forgive me I just won't be the same
(Won't be the same) (won't be the same)
Don't say it's the end, please don't make me spend a lifetime of shame
In the fools hall of fame
