A million to one:
That's what our folks say about this love of ours.
A million to one:
They say that our love will fade, like yesterday's clouds.
They are betting everything, that our love won't survive
They're hoping, in time, we will forget each other's love.

A million to one:
They say we're to young to know the meaning of love.
A million to one:
That they've forgotten the dreams that we're dreaming of.
But we'll forgive them,
Because we love them.
After all that's said and done.
There's one in a million;
A million to one.

A million to one:
They say that we're too young to know the meaning of love.
A million to one:
That they've forgotten the dreams that we're dreaming of.
But we'll forgive them,
Because we love them.
After all that's said and done.
There's one in a million;
A million to one.
