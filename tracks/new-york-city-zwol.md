Ah, the first time I met ya
I knew you'd be all I dreamed
I heard so much about ya
Reading in the magazines

Ah, but you old devil
You're better than I dreamed of
You old devil
Exactly what I've waited for
Exactly what I've waited for

And they call you New York
I love that city
New York, I love that city
I do, yes, I do
New York City
New York City, I do

New York City
I love you, I do

I met you at the airport
Got a little old cab into the Square
The neon lights of Broadway
How they're burning out here

I looked into the Village
Even in the Bowery
Waiting for the night time
57th Avenue

New York, I love that city
New York, I love that city
I do, yes, I do
New York City
New York City
New York City, I do

New York City
I love you
Ooh, come on

New York, I love that city
New York, I love that city
I do, yes, I do
New York City
New York City
New York City, I do

New York City
I love you, I do

44th Street and Broadway
I don't believe I'm here
I'm walking on down
To the Village, boy
Maybe I'll meet you there

I'll meet up with some queens
Well, you know what I mean, baby
So many places to be

You set the pace, baby
You got a face, baby
There's no other place
That I'd rather be

New York, New York City
I love you
New York, New York City
I love you

New York, New York City
I love you, hey, yes
New York, New York City
I love you

You got me
New York, New York City
I love you
