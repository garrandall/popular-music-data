Oh, oh, you've been good to me
You made me glad
When I was blue
And eternally I'll always be
In love with you
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl


I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love
I know little girl
Only a fool would doubt our love
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl


Thank you girl for loving me
The way that you do (Way that you do)
That's the kind of love
That is too good to be true
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl


Oh, oh, you've been good to me
You made me glad
When I was blue
And eternally I'll always be
In love with you
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl


Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
