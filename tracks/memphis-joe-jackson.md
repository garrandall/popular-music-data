Memphis - Where the hell is Memphis? 
Memphis - Where the hell is Memphis?

I got to get away, study my geography 
I'm just a shadow of the boy I used to be 
I used to see the light, now it's all a mystery 
I used to feel the beat, now I feel a million miles from... 

Memphis - Where the hell is Memphis? 
Memphis - Where the hell is Memphis?

I used dirty words never too excessively 
But saying "rock'n'roll" never seemed so bad to me 
I once said it in hip and happy company 
I was in and out in a second on my way to... 

Memphis - Where the hell is Memphis? 
Memphis - Where the hell is Memphis?

Memphis - So where the hell is Memphis? 

I had a one-way ticket and a little radio
I turned it on, heard the sound from twenty years ago 
Somebody smiled and said, that's the only way to go 
He died at twenty-one, now nobody's innocent in... 

Memphis - Where the hell is Memphis? 
Memphis - Where the hell is Memphis?

Somebody turned around, said, I got to disagree 
He wrote that sort of turn people out to anarchy 
He made them think about Marlon Brando on TV 
I guess they still went down against anything they got in... 

Memphis - Where the hell is Memphis? 
Memphis - Where the hell is Memphis?

I met a wise old man, he had longer hair than me 
He said, Memphis is nothing like it used to be 
A hundred dead guitarists lying in the cemetry 
I felt a sudden chill, now I'm not so sure about... 

Memphis - Where the hell is Memphis? 
Memphis - Where the hell is Memphis? 

I'm on a lonesome train on a lonesome track 
I think I'll jump right off, head for home, double back 
And though I'm better now I know that no-one knows the facts 
I'm gonna start again, forget I ever heard about...

Memphis - Where the hell is Memphis?
