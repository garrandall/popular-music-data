Think of it, I hold the world in the palm of my hand
Run a comb through my hair, head on out for some new foreign land
And all this could seem like a dream out the door
With everyday people, face down on the floor

I always said I could make it and be who I am
There's a new look in sight, what a change for the new modern man
With all this it seems, like I'm dying for more
The streets are on fire, never seen it before
It's like the sound of electric guitars

Worlds collide and hearts will be broken
Over and over it's the same every day-
How can I say what has never concerned me
The secret of my success is I'm living 25 hours a day

It's amazing to me, what a fool will believe to get by
With a change of your mind, I can live, I can fly
The harder they come, the harder they fall
I never say maybe and I go for it all
Just like the sound of electric guitars

Worlds collide and hearts will be broken
Over and over it's the same every day-
How can I say what has never concerned me
The secret of my success is I'm living 25 hours a day

With nothing to show, just sweat from my soul
My heart's on the line and I'm dying to go (dying to go)
Look at us now, gonna make it somehow
Hold on to me baby, can't hold me down

Worlds collide and hearts will be broken
Over and over it's the same every day-
How can I say what has never concerned me
The secret of my success is I'm living 25 hours a day

The secret of my success is I'm living 25 hours a day
25 hours a day
