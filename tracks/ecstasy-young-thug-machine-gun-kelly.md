DY Krazy
(Pure codeine, I need extra now
Pure codeine, I need extra now, yeah
Pure codeine, I need extra now)
Pure codeine, I need extra now, ecstasy
Pure codeine, I need extra now, ecstasy
Pure codeine, I need extra now, ecstasy (Wah, wah)
Pure codeine, I need extra now, privacy (Yeah)


Molly, Roxies
Oxycontin (Yeah)
Jubilee, Ostrich (Uh-uh)
Ten a key, we need thousands (Okay)
I can take the stick and I can lift it up (Yeah)
I can take this bitch and I can lift her up (Ayy)
I just took a bankroll and I lift it up (Okay)
I just drunk a PT, it was double sealed up


Yes, it's paid for, it's pretty and classy
You look way, way, more idiot than your crushes
Icy, icy, I got baddies in my custody
I been chewin' on that chewy and this ecstasy
I been kickin', bitch, and drippin' Louis quilt
Hundred Percocets, I took like four or five off the rip
My dick hard, bitch, come get after it
Growin' up, I kept a gun like a veteran
Soul snatcher, promise you ain't comin' back from this
She bad, treat her like the principal at teacher list
Yeah, make sure that the opposites kickin' it
Yeah, jewelry kickin' bullet and we keepin' it, no cap


Molly, Roxies
Oxycontin
Jubilee, Ostrich (Uh-uh)
Ten a key, we need thousands (Okay)
I can take the stick and I can lift it up (Yeah)
I can take this bitch and I can lift her up (Ayy)
I just took a bankroll and I lift it up (Okay)
I just drunk a PT, it was double sealed up


Fuck it
Inside of my house look like Colombia, I love it
Bloody fingerprints on my fingers from countin' hundreds
Learned from watching Goodfellas to keep it in the cupboard
Guns are just like pussy, pull it out, you better bust it
I might be in traffic in rush hour like Chris Tucker
Lord, I keep that MC Hammer, no you cannot touch it
I might go on tour and fuck a daughter and her mother
Pour some drank that's red like Robitussin, ayy
If I get pulled over, put my coke inside your crack, yeah
We get home, I pop a pill and I'll blow out your back, yeah
If I die today, like Makaveli, bring me back, yeah
If I got a problem, call my slime and he say, "Slatt," yeah


Molly, Roxies
Oxycontin
Jubilee, Ostrich (Uh-uh)
Ten a key, we need thousands (Okay)
I can take the stick and I can lift it up (Yeah)
I can take this bitch and I can lift her up (Ayy)
I just took a bankroll and I lift it up (Okay)
I just drunk a PT, it was double sealed up
