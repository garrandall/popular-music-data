I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

I never needed anything from you
And all I ever asked was for the truth
You showed your tongue and it was forked in two
Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you
Yeah, you preyed on my every mistake
Waited on me to break
Held me under hoping I would drown
Like a plague, I was wasting away, tryna find my way out
Find my way out

And it finally came the day
I start giving my heart away
For heaven's sakes, my bones will break
But you'll never own my soul, no

I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

I took them stones you threw, made chains for the crew (Ice)
I brought up ten hoes, this coupe only made for two (Yessir)
They all ran through it, it ain't nothing left to do
I need some more reasons to live out this evening (Straight up)
I been sipping forever and just taking whatever
Hoping, thinking whenever you'll be back around
Let's go our ways, whichever
You say how is however long
'Cause you know I'll never be alone

Love
Shorty gone back
Need it on sight
Crack it all back
Give her that pipe
All of my gang
Shorty went bad

I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

(Take it all away)

Why don't you
(Take what you want, take what you need)
Take what you need from me
(Take what you want, take what you need)
Why don't you
Whatever you need
