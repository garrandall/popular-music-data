Too many teardrops
For one heart to be crying
Too many teardrops
For one heart to carry on
You're way on top now
Since you left me
You're always laughing
Way down at me
But watch out now
I'm gonna get there
We'll be together
For just a little while
And then I'm gonna
Put you way down here
And you'll start crying
Ninety-six tears
Cry, cry
And when the sun comes up
I'll be on top
You'll be way down there
Looking up
And I might wave
Come up here
But I don't see you
Waving now
I'm way down here
Wondering how
I'm gonna get you
But I know now
I'll just cry, cry

I'll just cry
Too many teardrops
For one heart to be crying
Too many teardrops
For one heart to carry on
You're gonna cry ninety-six tears
You're gonna cry ninety-six tears
You're gonna cry, cry, cry, cry now
You're gonna cry, cry, cry, cry
Ninety-six tears
Come on and lemme
Hear you cry, now
Ninety-six tears, woo
I wanna hear you cry
Night and day, yeah
All night long
Uh, ninety-six tears
Cry, cry, cry
Come on, baby
Let me hear you cry now
All night long
Uh, ninety-six tears
Yeah, come on now
Uh, ninety-six tears
