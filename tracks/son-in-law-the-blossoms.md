I'm the mother-in-law
I sure am mad
The things said about me
Have all been bad
All he did was
Make my daughter sad
My no good son-in-law

He's gone all night
And he's got no job
Won't comb his hair
He's such a slob
Could find him on the corner
With the rest of the mob
My no good son-in-law

He sees another woman on the sly
When he said he loved
My daughter, how he lied
He's got no money or anything
Now the other day, he even
Hocked her wedding ring

He eats so much
That we've got no food
He's got no friends
Cause he's so rude
I just can't stand his attitude
My no good son-in-law

He sees another woman on the sly
When he said he loved
My daughter, how he lied
He's got no money or anything
The other day, he even
Hocked her wedding ring

He eats so much
That we've got no food
He's got no friends
Cause he's so rude
I just can't stand his attitude
My no good son-in-law

That bum
(That no good son-in-law)
Better find a job
(That no good son-in-law)
Can't see why she ever married me
(That no good son-in-law)
She oughta put him out, that's what
(That no good son-in-law)
