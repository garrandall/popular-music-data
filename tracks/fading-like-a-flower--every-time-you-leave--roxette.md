In a time where the sun descends alone 
I ran a long long way from home 
To find a heart that's made of stone 

I will try, I just need a little time 
To get your face right out of my mind 
To see the world through different eyes 

Every time I see you oh I try to hide away 
But when we meet it seems I can't let go 
Every time you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a flower 

Tell me why 
When I scream there's no reply 
When I reach out there's nothing to find 
When I sleep I break down and cry 
Cry, yeah 

Every time I see you oh I try to hide away 
But when we meet it seems I can't let go 
Every time you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a flower 

Fading like a rose 
Fading like a rose 
Beaten by the storm 
Talking to myself 
Getting washed by the rain 
It's such a cold cold town 
Oh, it's a such cold town 

Every time I see you oh I try to hide away 
But when we meet it seems I can't let go 
Every time you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a flower
