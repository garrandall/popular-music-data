Baby, we're the jokers
Livin' for fun in the glare of the sun
Though were out of focus
It's easy to see that we're happy to be as we are

We're laughin' all the time
And laughin's not a crime
So while we're in the prime of our lives
Every day's a pantomime

Tell 'em we're the jokers
Isn't it sad when the people get mad
Tryin' to provoke us
To follow the rules of society fools?

And they say it's time to make amends
On you the world depends
Ignore it all, my friends
While you can burn the candle at both ends

All too soon the time will come
For us to own up that we've grown up
So let's go wild and beat the drum
And have our fun while we are young

Baby, we're the jokers
Wearin' the crowns as the king of the clowns
Everywhere we go 'cause
We're livin' for fun and chasin' the sun

'Cause we know that once they leave the pack
The jokers can't go back
They've stepped across the track
And their place will be taken by the jack

Baby, we're the jokers
Baby, we're the jokers
Baby, we're the jokers
Baby, we're the jokers
