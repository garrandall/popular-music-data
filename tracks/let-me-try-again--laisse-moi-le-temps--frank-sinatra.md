I know I said that I was leaving
But I just, couldn't say goodbye
It was only self decieving
To walk away from someone
Who means everything in life to you

You learn from every lonley day
Ive learned and Ive come back to stay

Let me try again
Let me try again
Think of all we had before
Let me try once more
We can have it all
You and I again
Just forgive me
Or ill die
Please let me try again

I was such a fool to doubt you
To try and go it all alone
There's no sense to life without you
Now all i do is just exist
And think about the chance ive missed
To beg is not an easy task
But pride is such a foolish mask

Let me try again
Let me try again
Think of all we had before
Let me try once more
We can have it all
You and I again
Just forgive me
Or ill die
Please let me try again
