(It goes a little somethin' like, like, like this)


In my shoes my toes are busted
My kitchen says my bread is molded
I got a good job at the dollar store
One foot in the hole
One foot getting deeper
With a broken mirror and a blown-out speaker
I ain't got much else to lose

I'm faded
Flat busted
Been jaded
I've been dusted
I know that I've seen better days

One foot in the hole
One foot getting deeper
Crank it to eleven
Blow another speaker
And I ain't got, I ain't got much to lose

 x2
Cause I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
And the bottom drops out

I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
And the bottom drops out


Now, my cup's filled up with five-buck wine
I find myself here all the time
Another rip in the glass
Another chip in my tooth

Rained on
I've been stained on
Found another goat I try to put the blame on
And now I'm stepping on all the cracks
So I guess there ain't no use

I'm bent like glass
Second hand like glory
Missed the bus
But I'm in no hurry
Molasses fast
No business born

One foot in the hole
One foot getting deeper
Crank it to eleven
Blow another speaker
And I ain't got, I ain't got much to lose

I know that I've seen better days
(And the bottom drops out)
I've been the star of so many plays
(And the bottom drops out)

I walked on the edge without a hold whole way
(And the bottom drops out)
Cause I know, I know that I've seen better, better days
(And the bottom drops out)

(Now I'm real thirsty)
