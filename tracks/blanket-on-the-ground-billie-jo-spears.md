Come and look out through the window
That big old moon is shining down
Tell me now, don't it remind you
Of a blanket on the ground

Remember back when love first found us
We'd go slipping out of town
And we'd love beneath the moonlight
On a blanket on the ground

I'll get the blanket from the bedroom
And we'll go walking once again
To that spot down by the river
Where our sweet love first began
Just because we are married
Don't mean we can't slip around
So let's walk out through the moonlight
And lay the blanket on the ground

Oh, remember how excited
We used to get when love was young
That old moon was our best buddy
We couldn't wait for night to come

Now you know you still excite me
I know you love me like I am
Just once more I wish you'd love me
On the blanket on the ground

I'll get the blanket from the bedroom
And we'll go walking once again
To that spot down by the river
Where our sweet love first began
Just because we our married
Don't mean we can't slip around
So let's walk out through the moonlight
And lay the blanket on the ground
