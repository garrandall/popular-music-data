In this world it's hard
You know
Lovers come and lovers go
People never seem to hold on to what they've got
Some
They never stay together
You and I will be no better
We can make it last forever
We can keep this love alive
Through the storm
Through the tears
You and I
I know we can survive
To the day
Through the night
If we try we can keep it alive
We can keep it alive
I know sometimes it's been so tough
We've been so close to giving up
But our love's so strong and we keep holding on
Yeah
To what we got
It's easier to walk away
It takes a lot of love to stay
We've got all the love it takes
We know there's a brighter day
Through the storm
Through the tears
You and I
I know we can survive
To the day
Through the night
If we try we can keep it alive
We can keep it alive
We just gotta be strong
We just gotta be strong
We just gotta be strong together
We just gotta hold on
We just gotta hold on
We just gotta hold on and go through the storm
Through the storm
Through the tears
You and I
I know we can survive
To the day
Through the night
If we try we can keep it alive
We can keep it alive
Through the storm
Through the tears
You and I
I know we can survive
To the day
Through the night
If we try we can keep it alive
We can keep it alive
