I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth I was bound I would
I packed my grip and I grabbed
my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play
anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds
that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
"Sounds a little Goofus to me"

Cornfed chords appeal to me
I like rustic harmony
Hold a note and change the key
Hey but that's "Goofus"

Not according to the rules
That you learn in music schools
But the folks just dance like fools
They sure go for "Goofus"

Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all
the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same
"Goofus" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit
"Goofus" has been lucky for me
