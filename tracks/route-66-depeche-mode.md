Well if you ever plan to motor west
Travel my way
Take the highway that's the best
Get your kicks on Route 66

Well it winds from Chicago
To LA
More than two thousand miles
All the way
Get your kicks on Route 66

Well it goes to St. Louis
Down to Missouri
Oklahoma City looks oh so pretty
You'll see Amarillo
Gallup, New Mexico
Flagstaff, Arizona
Don't forget Winona
Kingman, Barstow, San Bernardino

If you get hip to this kind of trip
And go take that California trip
Get your kicks on Route 66

Well it goes to St. Louis
Down to Missouri
Oklahoma City looks oh so pretty
You'll see Amarillo
Gallup, New Mexico
Flagstaff, Arizona
Don't forget Winona
Kingman, Barstow, San Bernardino

If you get hip to this kind of trip
And go take that California trip
Get your kicks on Route 66
