Said her name was a hand me down name
From the side of a family that long ago came
Over here on a boat from somewhere in Spain
Sounded to me just a little bit strange, I guess
But I have to admit, it felt good on my lips


She tipped the DJ to play her favorite song
A Spanish little number that was a rocking on strong
She grabbed me by the sleeve and said, "Let's go and get it on"
By the second chorus I was singing right along with it
I don’t know what it meant but it felt good on my lips


Oh oh oh I, I wanna go crazy
You can go crazy too
Oh oh oh I, I wanna go crazy
I wanna go crazy with you


Everybody saying whoa how sweet it is
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips


She ordered us a drink, it was a purple kind of pink
She said it’s got a shot of a little bit of everything
Mellow yellow umbrella for a fella like me
It was just a bit mellow for me to be seen with
But I took a sip, yeah it felt good on my lips


Oh oh oh I, I wanna go crazy
You can go crazy too
Oh oh oh I, I wanna go crazy
I wanna go crazy with you


Everybody saying whoa how sweet it is
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips


When the lights came on and they hollered last call
I was busy getting lost in her cherry lip gloss
In a little corner booth, eye to eye no talk
She leaned in close and gave me one long
And wet Goodnight goodbye kiss and It felt good on my lips

Whoa, how sweet it is
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips
Whoa, how sweet it is
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips
