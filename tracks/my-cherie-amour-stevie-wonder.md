My cherie amour, lovely as a summer day
My cherie amour, distant as the milky way
My cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine

In a cafe or sometimes on a crowded street
I've been near you, but you never ever noticed me, no
My cherie amour, won't you tell me how could you ignore
That behind that little smile I wore
How I wish that you were mine

La la la la la la...

Oh my cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine

La la la la la la...
Oh my cherie amour...
Someday you'll be mine...
