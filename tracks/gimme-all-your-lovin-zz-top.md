I got to have a shot of what you got is oh so sweet.
You got to make it hot, like a boomerang I need a repeat,

Gimme all your lovin', all your hugs and kisses too,
Gimme all your lovin', don't let up until we're through,

You got to whip it up and hit me like a ton of lead,
If I blow my top will you let it go to your head?

Gimme all your lovin', all your hugs and kisses too,
Gimme all your lovin', don't let up until we're through.

You got to move it up and use it like a screwball would.
You got to pack it up, work it like a new boy should.

Gimme all your lovin', all your hugs and kisses too.
Gimme all your lovin', don't let up until we're through.
