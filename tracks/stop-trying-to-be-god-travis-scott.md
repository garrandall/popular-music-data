This is the rewatch, the hot pockets, the fritters, the missiles, the humans, all gathered in secrecy
And flying high as a kite


(Hm hm) just know what this about (hm, hm hm)
(Hm hm) palm trees, oceans
Fresh air that can break your heart

(Hm hm) stop tryna be God (hm hm, hm hm)
(Hm hm) stop tryna be God
(Hm hm) that's not who you are
(Hm hm) stop tryna be God
(Hm hm) that's just not your job
(Hm hm) stop tryna be God, God


Ride for it every night
Visions and these angles tight
Truth be told I never try
Diamonds of the wifin' like
All three Rollies look alike
After two you get a hook-up price
Stripper never worked a nine to five
Delta and I ship it overnight
Stop tryna be God almighty
Fuck the money, never leave your people behind
It's never love, no matter what you try
Still can see it comin' down your eyes

'Cause they did not create commandments (ohooh
When you hustle, always make it fancy (ohooh
The signal's far from what you can be (ohooh
'Cause air traffic controls the landing
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah


(Hm hm) stop tryna be God (hm hm, hm hm)
(Hm hm) stop tryna be God
(Hm hm) that's not who you are
(Hm hm) stop tryna be God
(Hm hm) that's just not your job
(Hm hm) stop tryna be God, God


Stop tryna play God almighty
Always keep your circle tight
I been wantin' shit my whole life
I wanted you bad, not tryna play God tonight
If I love her I'ma pass her one
First rule of war, you find an act of one
You can't win a trophy or a plaque off her
But never turn your back on her

'Cause they did not create commandments
When you hustle, always make it fancy
The signal's far from what you can be
'Cause air traffic controls the landing
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah

You won't succeed tryna learn me
Stick to the roads in my journey
Stay out of court when you got the attorney
She say she love 'em, want to really burn me


(Hm hm) stop tryna be God (hm hm, hm hm)
(Hm hm) stop tryna be God
(Hm hm) that's not who you are
(Hm hm) stop tryna be God
(Hm hm) that's just not your job
(Hm hm) stop tryna be God, God


Is it the complex of the saint that's keeping you so, so still?
Is it a coat of old paint that's peelin' every day against our will?
Is it too long since the last open conversation you had? oh no
And did you see the void in the past, and can you ever see it comin' back?
Well can you always be a step ahead of it for me?
Well can you always be a step ahead of it for me?

Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh

That it?
