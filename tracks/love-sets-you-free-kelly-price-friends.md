Featuring / montell jordan, sisqo, case,
Dru hill, blackstreet, babyface,
Tamar braxton, kandice love,
Aaron hall & lov her


Yeah
When peeps give you love
There's nothing in this world
That could set you free, yeah
Feel me? (def soul)
Yo g

 (sisqo)
Here I am all alone
Can't let you get the best of me
(Gotta let you know, love sets you free)


And these walls closing in
Closing in slowly, yeah


But ain't no way they can hold me down
I won't allow it
Cause I believe, yeah


I believe that love
Love sets you free
And it will take you higher, higher
If you believe, oh yeah
Kelly do you know?


Do you know what it's like
When shackles are on your feet
You're facing a hurricane
One more chapter in your journey, yeah
Break through darkness in my life
Like sunshine (yeah)
Now I believe
(I believe baby)
Now I believe that love (yeah)


Love will set you free
I know it's gonna take you higher

If you believe
You just believe
And you will receive


I opened up with my heart
There was no doubt
That hatred pulls you in
And love pulls you out
If you believe in faith you will never fall
Love will take you higher than any wall


Love will set you free
(If you believe in love)
Higher
(It will take you higher)
If you just believe
(And higher, oh love, love, love, love, love)
Set you free

Love (believe it)
Sets you free (love will set you free)
Higher (we're gonna take you higher, yeah yeah)
Just believe (love will, oh oh yeah)
If you just believe

(Ad lib while:)
Only love can set you free
Love will be everything you need
A little faith, charity
If you just believe

Open up, let it in
It will change everything, really
Love is life, love is free
If you only just believe

Only love can set you free
Love is free, let it be
A little faith, charity
If you just believe

Open up, let it in
It can change everything, really
Love is life, love is free
If you only just believe
(Love sets you free)
