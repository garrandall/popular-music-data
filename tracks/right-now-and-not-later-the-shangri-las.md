Listen to me, baby, and listen real good.
You know you're not treating me as good as you should.
Every time I call you here by my side,
Ya have some excuse and I want to know why.

Right now and not later, baby.
Right now and not later.
'Cause later may be too late,
And I gotta know right now.
I mean right now and not later, baby.
Right now and not later, baby.

There's something wrong and it's starting to show.
An' I don't wanna be the last to know.
So, if there's someone else standing in our way,
Then I think there's somethin' that you oughta say.

Right now and not later, baby.
Right now and not later.
'Cause later may be too late,
And I gotta know right now.
I mean right now and not later, baby.
Right now and not later, baby.

If we can't be lovers we can still be friends.
'Cause life goes on, even though love ends.
Boy, if you still want romance,
Baby, I'll give you just one more chance.

Right now and not later, baby.
Right now and not later.
'Cause later may be too late,
And I gotta know right now.
I mean right now and not later, baby.
Right now and not later, baby.
Right now and not later, baby.
Right now and not later, baby.
Right now and not later, baby.
Right now and not later...
