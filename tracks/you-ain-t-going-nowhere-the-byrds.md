Clouds so swift
Rain won't lift
Gate won't close
Railings froze
Get your mind off wintertime
You ain't goin' nowhere

Whoo-ee ride me high
Tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair?

I don't care how many letters they've send
The morning came, morning went
Pack up your money
Pick up your tent
You ain't goin' nowhere

Whoo-ee ride me high
Tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair?

Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots
Tailgates and substitutes
Strap yourself to a tree with roots
You ain't goin' nowhere

Whoo-ee ride me high
Tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair?

Now, Genghis Khan
He could not keep
All his kings supplied with sleep
We'll climb that hill no matter how steep
When we get up to it

Whoo-ee ride me high
Tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair?

Whoo-ee ride me high
Tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly
