Hello, honey, it's me
What did you think when you heard me back on the radio?
What did the kids say when they knew it was their long-lost daddy-o?

Remember how we listened to the radio
And I said, "That's the place to be"?
And how I got the job as an FM jock the day you married me?
It was two kids and I was into AM rock, but I just had to run around
It's been eight years since I left you, babe
Let me tell you 'bout what's gone down

I am the morning DJ at WOLD-D-D-D-D-D
Playing all the hits for you
Wherever you may be
The bright good morning voice
Who's heard but never seen
Feeling all of 45 going on 15

The drinking I did on my last big gig
It made my voice go low
They said that they like the young sounds (Sounds, sounds, sounds)
When they let me go

So I drifted on down to Tulsa, Oklahoma
To do me a late-night talk show
Now I've worked my way down home again
Here to Boise, Idaho
That's how this business goes

I am the morning DJ at WOLD-D-D-D-D-D
Playing all the hits for you
Wherever you may be
The bright good morning voice
Who's heard but never seen
Feeling all of 45 going on 15

I'm making extra money doing high school sock hops
I'm the big-time guest MC
You should hear me talking to the little children
And listen to what they say to me

I got a spot on the top of my head
Just begging for a new toupee
There's a tire around my gut from sitting on my
But it's never gonna go away

Sometimes I get this crazy dream
That I just take off in my car
But you can travel on 10,000 miles
And still stay where you are

Thinkin' that I should stop disc jockin'
And start that record store
Maybe I could settle down
If you'd take me back once more

Okay, honey I see
I guess he's better than me
Sure, old girl, I understand
You don't have to worry, I'm such a happy man

(WOLD)

I am the morning DJ at WOLD-D-D-D-D-D
Playing all the hits for you
Wherever you may be
The bright good morning voice
Who's heard but never seen
Feeling all of 45 going on 15

I am the morning DJ at WOLD-D-D-D-D-D
