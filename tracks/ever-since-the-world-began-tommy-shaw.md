I'll never know what brought me here
As if somebody led my hand
It seems I hardly had to steer -
My course was planned
And destiny, it guides us all;
And by its hand we rise and fall
But only for a moment
Time enough to catch our breath again

And we're just another piece of the puzzle
Just another part of the plan
How one life touches the other
Is so hard to understand
Still we walk this road together
We try and go as far as we can
And we have waited for this moment in time
Ever since the world began

Taken in the times gone by
We wonder how it all began
We never know, and still we try
To understand
And even though the seasons change
The reasons shall remain the same
It's love that keeps us holding on
Till we can see the sun again

And we're just another piece of the puzzle
Just another part of the plan
And we have waited for this moment in time
Ever since the world began

And I stand alone
A man of stone
Against the driving rain
And the night, it's got your number -
And the wind, it cries your name

And we search for clues
Win or lose
In this we're all the same
The hope still burns eternal
We're the keeper of the flame
