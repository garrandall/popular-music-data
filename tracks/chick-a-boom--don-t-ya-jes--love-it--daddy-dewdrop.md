Last night I had a crazy dream
About a chick in a black bikini
Oh she looked so good she couldn't be real
So she must be a magic genie
But then she disappeared around a corner
All I saw were three doors and the top of her bikini
I made it through the first door there was a party going on
I asked about the chick but what they said was this

Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom don't ya jes' love it
Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom don't ya jes' love it
Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom don't ya jes' love it
Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom-boom-boom

I found the bottom half
Behind the second door
Which took me to Africa I presume
This really far out cat was screaming half crazy
"Bomp boom a loo bom a long bam boo"
I said. "Hey man, cut that jive"
And tell me where the chick went
But he looked at me as pleased as could be
And said these words but I wonder what he meant

Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom don't ya jes' love it
Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom don't ya jes' love it
Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom don't ya jes' love it
Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom-boom-boom

Ah don't ya jes' love it
Ohdon't ya jes' love it
Don't ya love it, don't ya love it
Oh yeah, don't ya jes' love it
Don't ya jes' love it

Now I opened the third door and there she was
And she whispered so sexy oh oh
I tried to do the same and impress her with my style
But why I said this I'll never know

Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom don't ya jes' love it
Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom don't ya jes' love it
Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom don't ya jes' love it
Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom-boom-boom

Don't ya know it

Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom don't ya jes' love it
Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom don't ya jes' love it
Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom don't ya jes' love it
Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom-boom-boom
