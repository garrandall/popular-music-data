I was a sad and lonely guy
Seems no one would hear my cry
Baby (baby)

Lost in a state of misery
Not a soul to comfort me
Oh, baby (baby)

I couldn't find no help
I didn't know what to do with myself
Girl, I was standing in confusion
Badly disillusioned

When you wrapped your arms around me
I knew love had found me

I was lost, so lost
But found you in the nick of time
You know I was lost, yes, I was
Found you in the nick of time
Well, I was lost

I thank the Lord that you
Are the girl that came to my rescue
Baby (baby)

Oh, thanks for mending this heart of mine
You came just in time
Baby (baby)

Girl, I couldn't find my way
Oh, don't you hear what I say

I was standing in confusion
So badly disillusioned
Then you wrapped your arms around me
And I knew love had found me

I was lost, oh, lost
But found you in the nick of time
You know I was lost, oh
Found you in the nick of time
Well, I was

I'm here in desperation
No means of communication
Just looking for a sign
And then you threw out your life line

Oh, lost, baby
But found you in the nick of time
You know I was lost, yes, I was
Found you in the nick of time

Girl, I didn't even know you knew me
Oh, but when you walked up to me
Girl, you threw your arms around me
And I knew love had found me

I was lost, yes, I was
Found you in the nick of time
Well, I was lost, baby, baby
Found you in the nick of time

Well, I was out here in desperation
No means of communication...
