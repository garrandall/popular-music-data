Featuring Meja

Hap hap hap hap
(Found me a new day)
(Repeat twice)

(Chorus)
Happy is
Happy is
Hap hap happy
Is what we are
Happy
Is what we are when we're together

You know we have a friendship going on that will last
A long long time
The love we share will always be a memory
'Cuz good times always conquer the bad ones

It's true people get happy when they see us together
Yes they do

The joy we bring
Together we can show the world what happiness can be
All together


I feel free, yeah

It all that we have that brings us closer together
That we can be enjoying life

That all that matters to me

Believe in all that we have
Is something special to offer
The time we had

Surrounded by the good days
And the feeling of a good good vibration


Oh what we are


Hap hap hap hap
(Found me a new day)
(Repeat three times)

Believe in what we had

I said belive
I said believe, yeah

Believe in what we are

Believe, yeah

Believe in what we had

Believe in what we are

Believe in what we are

So do it baby


When we're together
We are


Yeah yeah


Happy is what we are
