Oh yeah alright now

I've been up half the night
Tryin' to find out
Where this windin' road
Is goin' to lead me to
My little lady comin' home so late
She left me feelin' blue
She's been screamin' and cryin'
Every step of the way
And now it's what you hear me say
There's a thousand of other places
That I'd rather be
I've been checkin' on
All the things that you see

I'm puttin' on my walkin' shoes
I tell ya baby, I'm not your fool
I'm steppin' out in my walkin' shoes
I tell ya baby, I'm leavin' you

I'm tellin' you
I'm gonna set things straight
Cause I'm tired of
Tryin' to understand
I'm the one who's girl
Gallivants all over town
With a mr. backdoor man
No more talkin'
It's time I start a walkin'
And now it's what you hear me say
There's a thousand other places
That I'd rather be
I'm here checkin' on
All the things that you see


My little lady
She makes herself crazy
She left me here all alone
No more talkin'
It's time I started walkin' out
And find myself a brand new home
There's a thousand other places
I'd rather be
I've been checkin' out
All the things that you see


I'm puttin' on my walkin' shoes
I tell ya baby, I'm not your fool
I'm steppin' out in my walkin' shoes
I'll see you later, cause I'm leavin' you
Oh oh
