(Magic, magic, magic)

Today she's yours but not for long,
There's competition that's mighty strong.
Don't you see I want her just like you do?
So hear this warning I'm givin' you.

You're gonna need magic,
You're gonna need magic,
Whoa, some kind of spell to make her stay.
You're gonna need magic,
You're gonna need magic,
I'm gonna steal your girl away.

Getting ready to make my play,
I saved my lovin' each and every day.
That simple sweet thing has captured my heart,
And it's gonna take magic to keep us apart.

You're gonna need (magic),
Yes, you're gonna need (magic),
Whoa, some kind of spell to make her stay.
You're gonna need (magic),
Yes, you're gonna need (magic),
Whoa, l'm gonna steal your girl away.

When I want her over to my side
It's gonna take witchcraft to turn the tide.
All your sweet honey talk won't change her mind,
Some sort of voodoo brew, you'll have to find.

Yes, you're gonna need (magic),
Yes, you're gonna need (magic),
Whoa, yes, some kind of spell to make her stay.
You're gonna need (magic),
Yes, you're gonna need (magic),
Whoa, l'm gonna steal your girl away.

Yes, you're gonna need (magic),
Yes, you're gonna need magic,
Whoa, magic.
