Was I wrong to think that you
Could live like I'm accustomed to?
Your daddy's rich, you could have married
A millionaire or dignitary
But you chose meare you happy?
Or sometimes is your mind

3000 Miles away, 3000 miles away
To a life that could have been?
A wife you could have been
I can just give you love, but is that good enough?

When there's a tear in your eye
It makes me almost wanna die
I think of what you threw away
To live hand to mouth from day to day
And I wonder, do you think of it too?
Or sometimes is your mind

3000 Miles away, 3000 miles away
To a life that could have been?
A wife you could have been
I can just give you love, but is that good enough?

So I must love you a little bit more, kiss you a little bit more
Hope you're satisfied so you won't wander

3000 Miles away, 3000 miles away
To a life that could have been?
A wife you could have been
I can just give you love, but is that good enough?
