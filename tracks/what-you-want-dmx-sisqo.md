And a nigga told a joke and the bitches didn't laugh
See now I do the math I see if you got this
And this and this to some cats that nigga's the shit (aiight?)
And that's all they fuckin with but see these bitches don't know
If these bitches ain't for real, these bitches don't go
Knock on the door no show, I'm sleep tryin to creep
Wit your best friend put it in dig deep


X let me talk to em for a minute
Oh I know it's so hard to be
A victim of my reality
Heard you callin me names
Said I was triflin
One thing you gotta know
Ima be a nigga for life
Ohhh yeah
Oooahhh
