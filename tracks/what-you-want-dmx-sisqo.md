Uhh..
DMX, Sisqo
Yo.. what these bitches want from a nigga?
Dru Hill, yaknahmsayin?
What these bitches want from a nigga?
HmmmMMMMMM (Ruff Ryders) DMX break em off
What these bitches want from a nigga?
Break em off, some..

Aiyyo! Dog, I meet bitches, discrete bitches
Street bitches, slash, Cocoa Puff sweet bitches (WHAT?)
Make you wanna eat bitches, but not me
Y'all niggas eat off the plate all you want but not D (UHH)
I fuck with these hoes from a distance
The instant they start to catch feelings
I start to stealin they shit
Then I'm out just like a thief in the night
I sink my teeth in to bite
You thinkin life, I'm thinkin more like - whassup tonight?
Come on ma, you know I got a wife
And even though that pussy tight I'm not gon' jeapordize my life (aight?)
So what is it you want from a nigga? (WHAT?)
I gave you, you gave me - BITCH, I blazed you, you blazed me (c'mon)
Nothin more, nothin less, but you at my door
Willin to confess that it's the best you ever tested
Better than all the rest, I'm like, "Aight girlfriend, hold up
I gave you, what you gave me Boo, a nut (f'real)"

What these bitches want from a nigga?
What you want.. (what you want)
What these bitches want from a nigga?
Really want..
What these bitches want from a nigga?
I've been keepin you up on it
Bling bling'n, on that jewelry girl I bought it
What these bitches want from a nigga?
Aiyyo, tell me what you want from me
Baby tell me what you want from me!
(So what you want?)

There was Brenda, LaTisha, Linda, Felicia (okay) -ac
