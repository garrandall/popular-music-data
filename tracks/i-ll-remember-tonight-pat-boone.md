I'll remember tonight
That lovely melody we danced to
The sweet confusion when we met
We never spoke a word
And yet we knew

I'll remember your smile
The way it warmed me in the moonlight
The way my heart began to melt
The strange effection that i felt for you

To think that only a moment ago
We were no more than strangers
And now my heart tells me that we are strangers no more

So what ever be false
Our little world of joys and sorrows
I'll remember tonight
For a thousand and one tomorrows

To think that only a moment ago
We were no more than strangers
And now my heart tells me that we are strangers no more

So what ever be false
Our little world of joys and sorrows
I'll remember tonight
For a thousand and one tomorrows
