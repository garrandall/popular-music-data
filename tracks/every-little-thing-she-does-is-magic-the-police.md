Though I've tried before to tell her
Of the feelings I have for her in my heart
Every time that I come near her
I just lose my nerve as I've done from the start


Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on


Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet


Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on


I resolved to call her up
A thousand times a day
Ask her if she'll marry me
In some old fashioned way
But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone


Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on


Every little thing, every little thing
Every, every little thing
Every little, every little, every little
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
That she does is magic
Eee oh oh, ee oh oh, ee oh oh, ee oh oh
Eee oh oh, ee oh oh, ee oh oh, ee oh oh
Eee oh oh, ee oh oh, ee oh oh, ee oh oh
Eee oh oh, ee oh oh, ee oh oh, ee oh oh
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing, she does is magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Ey oh, yo oh
Eee oh oh oh oh oh

Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet
