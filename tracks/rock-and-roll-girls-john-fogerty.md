Sometimes I think life is just a rodeo
The trick is to ride and make it to the bell
But there is a place, sweet as you will ever know
In music and love and things you never tell
You see it in their face, secrets on the telephone
A time out of time, for you and no one else

Hey, let's go all over the world
Rock and roll girls, rock and roll girls

Yeah, yeah, yeah

If I had my way, I'd shuffle off to Buffalo
Sit by the lake and watch the world go by
Ladies in the sun, listenin' to the radio
Like flowers on the sand, the rainbow in my mind

Hey, let's go all over the world
Rock and roll girls, rock and roll girls

Hey, let's go all over the world
Rock and roll girls, rock and roll girls

Hey, let's go all over the world
Rock and roll girls, rock and roll girls, yeah, yeah, yeah
