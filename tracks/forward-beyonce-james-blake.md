Forward
Best foot first just in case
When we made our way 'til now
It's time to listen, it's time to fight
Forward
Now we're going to hold doors open for a while
Now we can be open for a while
Forward
I love you more than this job, please don't work for me
Forward
Go back to your sleep in your favorite spot just next to me
Forward, forward
