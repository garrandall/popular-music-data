Oh!

Ay baby weh you ah deal with?
We come through a lot of things you know?
Wo wahamum to you?
Me make one little mistake you wan dun us?


If I had you back in my world
I would prove that I could be a better girl
Oh, oh, oh
If you let me back in
I would sho'nuff never never let you go again (hey baby)
I was so foolish to ever leave your side,
Searching for what was right before my eyes
It was me who didn't realize
'til it was gone but now I know I need you in my life

Boy I need you bad as my heartbeat (bad like the food I eat)
Bad as the air I breath (baby I want you bad)
I need you bad I can't take this pain (bad I can't take this pain)
Boy I'm about to go insane (baby I need you bad)
I need you
I need you
What I gotta do (baby I want you bad)
I need you
I need you
Do it all for you (baby I need you bad)


Baby there's nothing I wouldn't do
To get back what we had when love was true (oh oh oh)
No lie I'd give up all I got
Just so I could get back in my spot (Oh)




When you want him so bad and
You gotta get him back say, oh oh oh oh  (oh oh oh oh)
'cause it won't get no better
Two you are together say, oh oh oh oh (oh oh oh oh)
If you believe in love and
You can't give him up say, oh oh oh oh (oh oh oh oh)
If there's nothing you wont do to get
Back with your boo say Oh
