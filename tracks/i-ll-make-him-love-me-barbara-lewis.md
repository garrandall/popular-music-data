If it's the last thing that I do
I'll make him love me
If dreams are things that still come true
I'll make him love me

Nothing's impossible in this crazy world
Yesterday's miracles just happened to be
Tomorrow's reality
Oh wait and see

Although he may not want me now
I'll make him love me
I'm gonna get his heart somehow
I'll make him love me

Life's unpredictable, but one thing's for sure
Just as I know tomorrow follows today
I know that I'll find a way to make him love me
I'll make him love me

I'll make him love me
Life's unpredictable, oh, but one thing's for sure
Just as I know tomorrow follows today
I know that I'll find a way to make him love me

I'll make him love me
Oh, I'm gonna make him love me, wait and see
Oh, how he's gonna love me
I'll make him love me
