I wanna be your chick
I wanna be down 4 u
(Do ya trust me?) Yeah
(Love me?) Yeah
(You're puttin' it on me Ya must be)
Ya down ass bitch
I wanna be your chick
(It only for the RULE baby)
I ride 4 u, Die 4 u
Do anything ya want me to
I be ya down ass bitch


This is no intentions of bein' offensive
The women by callin ya'll bitches
My down ass bitches
Still my queen bitch's cut look clean
On ya finger next to the finger ya flipped at me
And this no in between me and you
Only me and you
Who else gon' put it on me like the RULE
God only looks after children and foo's
And you not so who gon' look after you
It's RULE baby


True baby
It's only for you baby
Vita thighs only divide if you inside
Cuz I love the way you touch me
Nobody can get it
And if it's comin' and gunnin'
Just come in it and spit it
So when ya gone for a minute
I just fantasize like if it's you It's all in it
Then I'm satisfied til' you come back to me
Holdin stack and jewels
V-i-t-a and my nigga J-a RULE baby




I'm gonna be here when ya need
RULE baby can always count on me
No you don't ever have to worry
You know I'll make it in a hurry
I'm here for ya
And I wont never leave shed, tears for ya
Cuz boy ya got to me
There will never be another for me 
You'll always be my one and only


Babygirl would ya bust ya gun with me? (Yeah yeah)
Lie to the feds to come get me? (Yeah Yeah)
And if I died Kill for me? (Yeah Yeah)
Are you trustin me? (Yeah Yeah)
Are you lovin me? (Yeah Yeah Yeah)
Yeah let's get it grinnin
Like we Ashford and ons or Ike and Anna Mae
On one their good days
You smile like sun rays 5'5 with brown eyes and thick legs
Only for the RULE baby




Now baby I told you I can show you better than I can tell you
Don't try to bring conversey and mail
Just sweet words and naked photos
I'm still that pretty down down ass 2 cars behind ya 6
And I diss any clown ass rockin my round ass only a down ass
And it's all for u
I've grown a tad bit since we been at like rabbits
To move a little bumper and it's
( AND IT'S ALL FOR RULE)
Shit Who gon' love you like that?
Thug with you wit a stack to the ceilin
And spilt in the dub with you
Cuz I played my position with KO-D's, O G's
Until that blood shed blood red and we O-Ded
Remember every word that ya told me
( SHOWED ME,HOLD ME)
All you need in your life is Chuck, drugs, and dubs on 22's
Now tell me who the hunny for you
CHUCK
