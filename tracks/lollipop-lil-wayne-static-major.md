No homo, Young Moolah baby
I said he so sweet, make her wanna lick the wrapper
So I let her lick the rapper



Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I love to touch her lovely lady lumps


Okay, lil mama had a swag like mine
She even wear her hair down her back like mine
I make her feel right when it's wrong like lying
Man, she ain't never had a move like mine
But man, I ain't never seen an ass like hers
That pussy in my mouth had me lost for words
So I told her to back it up like burp, burp
And made that ass jump like "jerp, jerp"


Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I love to touch her lovely lady lumps


Now get up after you back it up don't stop
Drop it shawty, drop it like its hot
Oh, drop it like its hot
Do it shawty, don't stop
Shawty say the nigga that she with ain't shit
Shawty say the nigga that she with ain't this
Shawty say the nigga that she with can't hit
But shawty, I'mma hit it, hit it like I can't miss
And "he can't do this", and "he don't do that!"
Shawty need a refund, need to bring that nigga back
Just like a refund, I make her bring that ass back
And she bring that ass back cause I like that


Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I love to touch her lovely lady lumps


She wanna lick, lick, lick, lick me like a lollipop
Shawty wanna lick me
So I let her lick the rapper


Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I love to touch her lovely lady lumps


Call me so I can make it juicy for ya
Call me so I can get it juicy for ya


Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I love to touch her lovely lady lumps


I get her on top, she drop it like it's hot
And when I'm at the bottom, she Hillary Rodham
The middle of the bed, I'm giving/getting head
I'm givin/getting head, I'm giving/getting head
I said, I like that

Call me so I can come and do it for ya
Call me so I can come and prove it for ya
Call me so I can make it juicy for ya
Call me so I can get it juicy for ya
