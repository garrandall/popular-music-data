Uh-huh...No homo (Young Mula, baby...)
I say he so sweet, make her wanna lick the rapper...
Remix, baby!


Lollipop, lollipop
Breasts is just like Dolly Part-on
She ride my spaceship 'til she hit the top
That hit the spot, 'til she ask
"How many li-i-li-i-licks do it take 'til she get to shop?"
Don't worry why my wrist got so freeze
Tell her, "Girl, like Doritos, that's (na-cho cheese)"
Tell her friends, "Like Fritos, I'm tryin to (Lay)
I cain't (only have one) and I ain't tryin to wait"
This a song with Wayne, say you know it's gon' melt
Butchu ain't finna murder me like everybody else
I'ma rap like I got some type of respect for myself
I don't do it for my health, man I do it for the belt
Man, I do it to the death, 'til the roof get melt
Hunnid degrees, drop the roof, so the Coupe don't melt
Man, the flow so cold, chicken soup won't help
We need fo' mo' hoes, we need ohh-ohh-OH-OHHH!!
You know what it is when we're outta town
We ball in two seats, and you out of booooounds
So come here baby guuurrrrl
You now fuckin wit the best in the woooooooooooooooooorld...
Lollipop-pop...
The best in the woooo-oooOOOOOOOOOOOOORLD...
(Sh-sh-she lick me like a lollipop..)
(She-she lick me like a lollipop..)
Woooorld...woooorld...


Shawty want a thug, thug, thug...
Bottles in the club, club club...
Shawty wanna hump, you know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps, lumps, lumps...


Shawty say she wanna lick the rapper..
And she gonna lick the rapper
And I just wanna act like a porno-flicking actor
I (Anita Bake) her, now she caught up in that (Rapture)
I got so much chips, I swear they call me Hewlett Packard
I got so much chips, you can have a bag if you're a snacker
Greedy mutha-fudge cakes, now tell me how dat fudge taste
I do it for Bloods' sake, suu-woo think it's voodoo
How that roof do di-di-dissipate, your girl wants to participate
She so-so-sophisticate, 'cause her brain is off the chain
And then my diamonds are in the choir, because they sang from off my chain
And my Nina just joined the gang, because, all (she) do is (bang)!
Like Ricky Martin; Wayne and Kanye - pick your poison
If that woman wanna cut, then tell her I am Mr. Ointment
Tell her to make an appointment with Mr. I-can't-make-an-appointment
Take my lollipop and enjoy it - remix!




Why would she? She probably be the odd cookie
In the plastic bag 'bout to get crushed by a building
I flushed out the feeling of, me bein the shit
'cause I was leavin skid marks on, ev'rywhere I sit
I am everywhere, I'm it like, Hide-n-Go
And I can go anywhere, innie, minnie, miney, mo
I'm in yo', neighborhood area, CD thang, tape deck
IPod, ya gurlfriend and she say I got great sex
Safe sex is great sex, better wear a latex
'cause you don't want that late text, that "I think I'm late" text
Heh-heh, so wrap it up
Bu-bu-but, he's so sweet sh-she wanna lick the rapper



(RE-RE-RE-REMIX, BA-BAY!!)


Lick me like a lollipop...(lollipop...)
She-she lick me like a lollipop...(lollipop...)
Sh-sh-she lick me like a lollipop...(lollipop...)
She-she lick me like a lollipop...(lollipop...)
