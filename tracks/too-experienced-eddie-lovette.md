She hates the site of me,
Because I turned her offer down.
I think she wanted a clown,
Someone she could take for a ride.
Telling her that I'm:

Too experienced to be taken for a stroll.
Too experienced to let someone take my soul.
Too experienced to be taken for a ride;
I know it's not my foolish pride.

She doesn't want me around,
'Cause I turned her offer down.
She's always saying we were meant to be,
Somehow she thought I'd be her clown.
Telling her that I'm:

Too experienced to be taken for a stroll.
Too experienced to let someone take my soul.
Too experienced to be taken for a ride;
I know it's not my foolish pride.

I'm just too experienced to be taken for a stroll.
Too experienced to let someone take my soul.
Too experienced to be taken for a ride;
I know it's not my foolish pride.

(.)

A girl needs sugar in her heart,
I know where I'm gonna start, yea.
Feeding the candy roll in every day,
I think I can save a little way.

I'm just too experienced to be taken for a stroll.
Too experienced to let someone take my soul.
Too experienced to be taken for a ride;
I know it's not my foolish pride.
