Woahhhhh woahhhhhhh 
Shes got Brazilian leather boots on the pedal of her German car 
Listen to the Beatles singing back in the USSR 
Yeah shes goin around the world tonight 
But she ain't leavin here 
Shes just going to meet her boyfriend down at the street fair 

It's a french kiss, italian ice 
Spanish moss in the moonlight 
Just another American Saturday night 

There's a big toga party tonight down at Delta Chi 
They've got Canadian bacon on their pizza pie 
They've got a cooler full of cold Coronas and Amstel light 
It's like were all livin' in a big ol' cup 
Just fire up the blender, mix it all up 

It's a French kiss, Italian ice 
Margaritas in the moonlight (woahhhh) 
Just another American Saturday night 

You know everywhere has something they're known for 
Although usually it washes up on our shores 
My great great great granddaddy stepped off of that ship 
I bet he never ever dreamed we'd have all this 

You know everywhere has somethin' they're known for 
Although usually it washes up on our shores 
Little Italy, Chinatown, sittin' there side by side 
Live from New York, It's Saturday Night! 

It's a French kiss, Italian ice, 
Spanish moss in the moonlight 
Just another American, just another American,
Its just another American Saturday night
