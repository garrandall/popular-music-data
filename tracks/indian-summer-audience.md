Connor-Werth-Williams

Friends say to take it easy
I won't and they wonder why
I can't give up thaht easy
Lay me down and die

Sat where it's cool and shady
Could age take the taste away
I met a widow lady
Couldn't waste a day

That was my Indian Summer
That was my Indian Summer

She said she'd lost her husband
I told her I'd lost my wife
Those years together had been the best of my whole life

Friends say we ought to marry
I smile and I shake my head
One wife will make you happy
Two will make you dead
