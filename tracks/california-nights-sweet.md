The New York girls, they've gone down to California
Don't say they didn't warn ya
'Bout spending time in Miami F.L.A
That ain't no place to be anyway
Ooh, looking for someone in their life
Waiting for love to shine it's light

Everybody's dancing, California nights
Summer in the city, California nights
Boogie through to morning, California nights
California never go away, I'm here to stay

Those Vegas chicks have gone and thrown it all away
They're gonna settle down in L.A
They've heard the stories of Hollywood and stars
Sunset Boulevard and custom cars
From roulette to room let, changing signs
Ceasers to Rainbow, life unwinds

Everybody's dancing, California nights
Summer in the city, California nights
Boogie through to morning, California nights
California never go away, I'm here to stay

Everybody's dancing, California nights
Summer in the city, California nights
Boogie through to morning, California nights
California never go away, I'm here to stay

Everybody's dancing, California nights
Summer in the city, California nights
Boogie through to morning, California nights
