Another night, another dream, and always you
It's like a vision of love that seems to be true 
Another night, another dream, and always you 
In the night I dream of a love so true

Just another night, another vision of love
You feel joy, you feel pain
Cause nothing will be the same
Just another night, it's all that it takes
To understand the difference between lovers and fakes
Oh baby!

I talk, talk, I talk to you 
In the night in your dream of love so true
I talk, talk, I talk to you 
In the night in your dream of love so true

In the night, in my dreams I'm in love with you 
Cause you talk to me, like lovers do 
I feel joy, I feel pain, 'cause it's still the same 
When the night is gone I'll be alone

Another night, another dream, and always you
It's like a vision of love that seems to be true 
Another night, another dream, and always you 
In the night I dream of a love so true

Just another night, another dream
Another vision of love
And we are here to set you free
I am the lover, your lover
Hey, sister, let me cover your body with my loving
Is my loving just a number?

Vision of love that seems to be true
We will do all the things that only lovers do
Vision of love that seems to be true
We will do all the things that only lovers do

In the night, in my dreams
I'm in love with you 
Cause you talk to me, like lovers do 
I feel joy, I feel pain, 'cause it's still the same 
when the night is gone I'll be alone

Another night, another dream, and always you
It's like a vision of love that seems to be true 
Another night, another dream, and always you 
In the night I dream of a love so true

I talk, talk, I talk to you 
In the night in your dream of love so true
I talk, talk, I talk to you 
In the night in your dream of love so true

In the night, in my dreams I'm in love with you 
Cause you talk to me, like lovers do 
I feel joy, I feel pain, 'cause it's still the same 
When the night is gone I'll be alone

Another night, another dream, and always you
It's like a vision of love that seems to be true 
Another night, another dream, and always you 
In the night I dream of a love so true
