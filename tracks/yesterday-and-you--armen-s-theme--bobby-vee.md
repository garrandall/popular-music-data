I sit alone in this cafe
And listen to the jukebox play
Remindin' me of yesterday and you
Each moment was a valentine
You promised you'd be always mine
And I believed the words you said were true

I see your face, it's everywhere
I close my eyes, but you're still there
Remindin' me of things we used to do
I wonder what your heart is sayin'
When you hear a jukebox playin'
The song that brings me yesterday and you

I wonder what your heart is sayin'
When you hear a jukebox playin'
The song that brings me yesterday and you

I sit alone in this cafe

I see your face, it's everywhere
