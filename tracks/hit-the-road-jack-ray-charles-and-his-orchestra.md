Hit the road Jack and don't cha come back
No more no more no more no more
Hit the road Jack and don't cha come back
No more
What'd you say?

Hit the road Jack and don't cha come back
No more no more no more no more
Hit the road Jack and don't cha come back
No more


Old woman old woman, oh you treat me so mean
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen
I guess if you say so
I'll have to pack my things and go (that's right)


Hit the road Jack and don't cha come back
No more no more no more no more
Hit the road Jack and don't cha come back
No more
What'd you say?

Hit the road Jack and don't cha come back
No more no more no more no more
Hit the road Jack and don't cha come back
No more


Now baby, listen baby, don't you treat me this way
Cause I'll be back on my feet some day
Don't care if you do, cause it's understood
You ain't got no money, you just a no good
Well I guess if you say so
I'll have to pack my things and go (that's right)


Hit the road Jack and don't cha come back
No more no more no more no more
Hit the road Jack and don't cha come back
No more
What'd you say?

Hit the road Jack and don't cha come back
No more no more no more no more
Hit the road Jack and don't cha come back
No more


Well, (don'cha come back no more)
Uh, what'd you say? (don'cha come back no more)
I didn't understand you (don'cha come back no more)
You can't mean that (don'cha come back no more)
Oh, now baby please (don'cha come back no more)
What you're trying to do to me (don'cha come back no more)
