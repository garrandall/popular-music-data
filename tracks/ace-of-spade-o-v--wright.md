Hey, that game you were playing
Been played on me before
But the girl that played it
She not here anymore

Listen to me baby, have no fear
Game you were playin'
I'm the one that brought it here
I brought it here, woah, I brought it here

I'm the ace of spade
Baby, that's me
Ace of heart
Just keep loving misery

Ace of diamond
Somethin' every woman crave
I use the ace of club
To keep my baby in place

Listen to me, baby, you just can't win
Places you tryin' to go
I already been, I been there
God, I know I been there

Nine to the ten
You just can't win
Eight to the four
Hey, just too low

From the two to the three
You can't beat me
I'm the ace of spade, baby
You can't beat me

I love you, baby
I can't let you beat me, no

Get your coat
I'll bring your hat
I'm the ace of spade, baby
Whenever you come back

Woah, I love you, baby
From the bottom of my heart
But I've got to be the ace of spade, baby
You can't beat me

I was made, huh
I was made for you to follow me, baby
Everywhere I go

Hey, hey, oh, yeah
I'm still the ace of spade, baby
Yes I am, baby
