Four men in a rock 'n' roll band
Fly at night, in the morning we land
Fly at night till we're satisfied
See the morning from the other side

And when you close your eyes
Sleep comes fast
When you fly the universe, well you
Need some rest
Yeah, you need some rest

Oh, we like the big wide spaces
Yeah, we like a sea of faces
Time is just a rubber band
Time is at our command

And when we look out
And see you there
You seem much closer and you
Feel so near
Yeah, you feel so near

Well, we fly by night
It's like a rocket flight
And baby, that's just what it's for
Yeah, we fly by night
It makes you feel all right
You keep coming back for more

Well, we fly by night
It's like a rocket flight
And baby, that's just what it's for
We fly by night
It makes you feel all right
You keep coming back for more

Four men in a rock 'n' roll band
Fly at night, in the morning we land
Fly at night till we're satisfied
See the morning from the other side
