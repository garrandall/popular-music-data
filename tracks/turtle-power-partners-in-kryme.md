T-U-R-T-L-E power
T-U-R-T-L-E power
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

On the half shell, they're the heroes four
In this day and age, who could ask for more?
The crime wave is high with muggings mysterious
All police and detectives are furious
'Cause they can't find the source
Of this lethally evil force
This is serious, so give me a quarter
I was a witness, give me a reporter

Call April O'Neil in on this case
And you'd better hurry up, there's no time to waste
We need help, like quick, on the double
Have pity on the city, man, it's in trouble
We need heroes, like the Lone Ranger
When Tonto came pronto when there was danger
They didn't say, "We'd be there in half an hour"
'Cause they displayed Turtle Power

T-U-R-T-L-E power
T-U-R-T-L-E power
T-U-R-T-L-E power
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

T-U-R-T-L-E power
T-U-R-T-L-E power
T-U-R-T-L-E power
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

Now our ace reporter was hot on the trail
Determined to put these crooks in jail
She spied the bad guys and saw what happened
But before she knew it, she fell in the trap and got caught
Yeah, she was all alone
With no friends and no phone
Now, this was beyond her worst dreams
'Cause she was cornered by some wayward teens

Headed by Shredder they were anything but good
Misguided, unloved, they call them The Foot
They could terrorize and be angry youth
And they mugged the people who needed proof
Then from out of the dark came an awesome sound
Shouted "Cowabunga" as they hit the ground
From the field of weeds, the heroes rescued the flower
'Cause they possessed Turtle Power

T-U-R-T-L-E power
T-U-R-T-L-E power

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

Do you stand for what you believe in
And find the strength to do what's right?
That's Turtle Power

Heroes on a half shell, they're on a mission
When there's a battle, got the enemy wishin'
That they stayed at home, instead of fightin'
These ninja masters with moves like lightnin'
They were once normal, but now they're mutants
Splinter's the teacher, so they are the students
Leonardo, Michaelangelo, and Donatello
Make up the team with one other fellow Raphael
He's the leader of the group
Transformed from the norm by the nuclear goop

Pizza's the food that's sure to please
These ninjas are into pepperoni and cheese
Back to the story: "It's not hard to find
Ninja's not just of the body, but of the mind"
Those were the words that their master instructed
But a letter from Shredder had Splinter abducted

That was the last straw, spring into action!
Step on The Foot, now they're gonna lose traction
Now this is for real, so you fight for justice
Your shell is hard, so you shout
"They can't dust us off
Like some old coffee table!"
Since you've been born, you've been willing and able
To defeat the sneak
Protect the weak
Fight for rights and your freedom to speak

Now the villain is chillin', so you make a stand
Back to the wall, put your sword in your hand
Remember the words of your teacher, your master
"Evil moves fast, but good moves faster than light
Shining from your illumination
Good-versus-evil equals confrontation
So when you're in trouble, don't give in and go sour
Try to rely on your Turtle Power"
