This ain't about tailgates
Ain't about bonfires
Ain't about souped up cars, water towers
Drowning in a bottle of Jack
This ain't about Chevy's
Ain't about money
Ain't about blue suede shoes, coo-coo-ca-choos
Got nothin' to do with that


It's a song about a girl
It goes like this
Ah, little heartbreak queen
Rockin' the jeans
Baby, just read my lips
It's a song about a girl
The one you can't forget
Ah, blows your mind every time
You think it's gonna be a hit
It's a song about a girl

Ah, it's a song about you, oh, yeah
This ain't about hometowns
Ain't about back roads
Ain't about shoulda, coulda, wish I woulda
Rear views looking back
This ain't about goodbyes
Ain't about come-backs
Oh, got nothing to do with the stars and the moon
Man you're gettin' way off track



Baby you, yeah you, yeah you, know who you are
Baby you, yeah you, read my lips, hear my heart
Listen to this guitar

It's a song about a girl
It goes like this
Ah, little heartbreak queen
Rockin' the jeans
Baby, just read my lips
It's a song about a girl

Every time
Ah, don't think too hard
Dig too deep
Or read between the lines



It's a song about a girl, girl, ohh, yeah
It's a song about a girl, girl, oh

It's a song about a girl

This ain't about tailgates
Ain't about bonfires
Ain't about souped up cars, water towers
Drowning in a bottle of Jack
