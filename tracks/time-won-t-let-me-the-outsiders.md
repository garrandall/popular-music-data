I can't wait forever
Even though you want me to
I can't wait forever
To know if you'll be true

Time won't let me-ee-ee (Whoa, no)
Time won't let me-ee-ee (Whoa, no)
Time won't let me-ee-ee-ee
Wait that long

Can't you see
I've waited too long
To love you
To hold you in my arms?

Time won't let me-ee-ee (Whoa, no)
Time won't let me-ee-ee (Whoa no)
Time won't let me-ee-ee-ee
Wow

Ah, ah, ah, ah

I can't wait forever
Even though you want me to
I can't wait forever
To know if you'll be true

Time won't let me-ee (Whoa, no)
Time won't let me-ee (Whoa, no)
Time won't let me-ee-ee
Wait that long

It won't let me wait that long
Hear me baby, baby that long
Take me back
I'm comin' back right now
Hear me baby, said
I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home
Oh, hear me talkin'
Pretty baby, don't you know
I'm comin' back, wow
Oh, pretty baby, take me back
I'm comin' back
Open up your arms and take me back
Oh, here I come, wow
Oh, pretty baby, comin' back
Take me back
Hey, oh, baby, take me back, take me back
Oh, I cannot wait, I cannot wait
Here I come, baby
Comin' home, I'm comin' home
Take me back
