Don't speak a word of it if you never heard of it
Don't speak a word of it if you never heard of it

Yeah 
Locals only, homies
Couple bad chicks that hopefully wont tell nobody
Pack as many as we can in the four door
When I say, "Roll with me" better say "Totally"
If I take you there 
You better blend in cuz I only share 
With a few best friends
Who don't give a shit about a few dead ends

Off the road we found a dope spot
We got a place that no one knows
Come and meet me past the boardwalk
You can only go when the tide is low so let's roll

And I can't believe that no one knows about this place
Don't tell anyone it wouldn't be the same
Don't let anybody know oh oh
Gotta keep it down on the low oh oh
Let's go down to the cutty, cutty
Let's go down to the cutty spot

And I can't believe that no one knows about this place
Don't tell anyone it wouldn't be the same
Don't let anybody know oh oh
Gotta keep it down on the low oh oh
Let's go down to the cutty, cutty
Let's go down to the cutty spot

Yo
Hop the fence with confidence
To our spot that tops like all the rest
Show flesh we know cuz it lies beyond
And we take our time, cuz it might be gone
Day to day livin, sand stone crackin 
Can't say we ain't livin with the boom box slappin 
What happens? Outsiders bite me
Cab or a nine speed
Gettin there just ain't likely

Off the road we found a dope spot
We got a place that no one knows
Come and meet me past the boardwalk
You can only go when the tide is low so let's roll

And I can't believe that no one knows about this place
Don't tell anyone it wouldn't be the same
Don't let anybody know oh oh
Gotta keep it down on the low oh oh
Let's go down to the cutty, cutty
Let's go down to the cutty spot

And I can't believe that no one knows about this place
Don't tell anyone it wouldn't be the same
Don't let anybody know oh oh
Gotta keep it down on the low oh oh
Let's go down to the cutty, cutty
Let's go down to the cutty spot

To the cutty spot
Yeah, whoa
Don't speak a word of it if you never heard of it
Don't speak a word of it if you never heard of it
Oh if you never heard of it
Don't speak a word of it if you never heard of it
Don't speak a word of it if you never heard of it
Never heard of it
Cutty spot
