Must be love
It must be love, talkin? ?bout love
Must be love
It must be love, talkin? ?bout love
Something?s got me upside down
And I never been like this before
Something?s got me goin? in and out
And I never moved like this before
Something?s glowin? ?round my eyes
And I never looked like this before (Oh, no, no, no, no, no)
Something?s brought this girl to life
And I never felt like this before
And I?m sure that was something that happened to me
Must be love
It must be love, talkin? ?bout love
Must be love (Ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...)
It must be love, talkin? ?bout love (Oh, listen now)
Something?s caught me by surprise
And I never opened up before
Something?s got me mystified
And I never lost my cool before
Something?s racing my heart beat
And I never lost like this before (Never, never, never)
Something?s got a hold of me
And I never (Ah) touched like this before
And I know that was never is happening to me
Must be love (Ah...ah...ah...ah...)
It must be love, talkin? ?bout love
Must be love (Oh, oh oohee, baby)
It must be love, talkin? ?bout love
Ah...whoa...whoa...ah...oh.. ah...ee...
Must be love (Ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...yeah)
It must be love, talkin? ?bout love
Must be love (Oh...oh..)
It must be love, talkin? ?bout love
Must be love (Oh, oh oohbaby)
It must be love, talkin? ?bout love
Must be love (Must be, must be)
It must be love, talkin? ?bout love
Must be love (Got me upside down)
It must be love, talkin? ?bout love (Got me goin? in and out)
Must be love (Talking about love)
It must be love (Hey, I?m talkin? ?bout love), talkin? ?bout love
Must be love (Oh...oh...oh.ohohoh.oh
It must be love, talkin? ?bout love (Yeah)
Must be love (Woo...oh...oh.)
It must be love, talkin? ?bout love (I?m talking ?bout love)
Must be love (Yeah...yeah...yeah...yeah...)
It must be love, talkin? ?bout love
Must be love
It must be love, talkin? ?bout love (Oh...oh...oh.ohoh)
