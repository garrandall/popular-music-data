You, you're the monster of the year,
Number one on my chart slick to Slick, you're a smash.

I said you're, everybody's favorite song,
Singalong, get it on, Superstar, Dynamite, swing tonight.

You, you you're number one. On my radio. Baby,
You're my solid gold. You're number one.
On my radio. Baby, you're my solid gold.

OH, You, you are the Magic in the groove,
You headline line, on my show, you got soul tambourine.

I said YOU, hit the mark, you made the grade,
You're the rock, I'm the roll, music play Let It Go, Get It on.

You, you, you're number one. On my radio, baby, you're my solid gold.

Ooh, You're number one. On my radio, baby, you're my solid gold.

Hey, you're number one.

YOU!

YOU! GET IT ON

NUMBER ONE! SOLID GOLD!

NUMBER ONE! SOLID GOLD!
OH, You, you are the Magic in the groove,
You headline line, on my show, you got soul tambourine.

I said YOU, hit the mark, you made the grade,
You're the rock, I'm the roll, music play Let It Go, Give it Up.

You, you, you're number one. On my radio, baby, you're the solid gold.

Oh, you're number one. On my radio. Baby, you're the solid gold.

Hey, you're number one.
(MUSIC BREAK)
Number one, you're number one
Number one, you're number one.
You're number one, on my radio. Baby, you're the solid gold.
You're number one, on the radio, baby, you're the solid gold.
You're number one, on the radio, baby, you're the solid gold.
