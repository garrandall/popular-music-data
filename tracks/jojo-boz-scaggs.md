Look out behind you
Jo Jo's got his gun
He wouldn't mean to
You know he likes his fun

Jo Jo dig those spinning lights
Way out games and dizzy heights below him
Jo Jo dig those Broadway nights
Flashy lines you know him

He got you covered
You know it right out front
Hmm hmm
Hey fifty dollars
He'll get you all you want
Jo Jo dig those spinning nights
Way out games and dizzy heights below him 
And its all below him
Jo Jo dig those Broadway lights
Flashy lines you know him

Ever so rarely
That man in a millions born
Gentle and soft
But who'd just as soon off you
For looking the wrong way as not
(Jo Jo) Jo Jo

His baby stays high
Got to keep her sweet
He keep her just right
Keeps her on the street

Jo Jo dig those spinning lights
(Way out games and dizzy heights) 
Oh below him
Jo Jo dig those Broadway nights
Oh you know him

(Jo you are so low
Oh Oh Jo how low can you go)

Jo Jo dig those spinning lights
Way out games and dizzy heights below him
(Jo Jo dig those Broadway nights)
Broadway nights
You know him

Say what do you think
Of gentlemen wearing mink
Gentle and soft
But who'd just as soon off you
For looking the wrong way as not
(Jo Jo) Jo Jo

Jo Jo dig those spinning lights
Way out games and dizzy heights below him
Man its way below him
Jo Jo dig those Broadway nights
Flashing lights below him
Yeah yeah
Jo Jo
How low can you go
Jo Jo Oh Oh
