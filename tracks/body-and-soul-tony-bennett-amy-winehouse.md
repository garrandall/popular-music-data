My heart is sad and lonely,
For you I sigh, for you, dear, only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you, body and soul


I spend my days in longing,
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you, body and soul


I can't believe it, it's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance


Are you pretending, it looks like the ending
Unless I could have one more chance to prove, dear


My life a wreck you're making


You know I'm yours just for the taking


I'd gladly surrender, myself to you, body and soul




Are you pretending, it looks like the ending
Unless I could have one more chance to prove, dear


My life a wreck you're making


You know I'm yours for just the taking


I'd gladly surrender, myself to you, body and soul
