Yo
Shoot 'em, Biv
Yeah
Bell Biv Devoe
Bouncing across the airwaves

Shoot 'em
Shoot 'em, Rick
Spiderman's in the house
Shoot 'em

No one even knows it
Girl, to me
You just can't show it
You know that I won't buy it
Girl, there's no use to trying to hide it

Cause girl
You know I need it
Behind the back, girl
I've seen it
Take me as a joking prankster
I can't believe my girlfriend's a gangsta

Not my baby

I lost my trust in you
It's really driving me crazy
And I don't know what I'm gonna do
I'm going outta my mind

And if she keeps it up
We're through
You take me as a prankster
But baby
I'm still in love with you

Cause she's a gangsta
Gangsta boogie
Cause she's a gangsta
Gangsta boogie

It's obvious to see
She's dressing better than me
Driving a Benz and making money
Don't even have the time to call me honey

She carries a gun
Just for fun
One day we'll argue
Then she'll shoot me
Girl, I'm not the one

Not my baby

I lost my trust in you
It's really driving me crazy
And I don't know what I'm gonna do
I'm going outta my mind

And if she keeps it up
We're through
You take me as a prankster
But baby
I'm still in love with you

Cause she's a gangsta
Gangsta boogie
Cause she's a gangsta
Gangsta boogie

Here we go
Yo, Spiderman
Bring that beat back
Here we go
BBD

She's a gangsta
You know she would
Try to hide it by looking good
Roll behind your back
She could and stood a female hood

She's the pretty in pink
That makes you think
She wears gold, silk
And even mink
And if she catches you with another lover
You're a dead mutha

Cause she's a gangsta
Girl, I lost my trust in you
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Cause she's a gangsta
I'm still in love with you

Cause she's a gangsta
She don't know that I know
She's a gangsta
She's a gangsta
