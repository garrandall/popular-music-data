In the morning the time seems to fly.
In the morning the dives seem to die.
The wine I had, it tasted fine, but it aint gonna change the times,
Though I have someone else with me, that's just fine, it's not the wine,
And loving you just crossed my mind.

The price is low, it don't take much, to live on empty dreams,
So I just sit here laughing, eatin beans
Then I take a drink again, least I've got one good friend,
But I don't like talking to wine, but that's just fine, cause it's all mine,
And loving you just crossed my mind.

Feelin all the pain inside, you know that don't seem right,
Feelin all the cries in my eyes.
Loving any woman who don't mind, spending time,
Talking over good times and drinking, lots of wine,

Well I don't have a minute, but I've got lots of time,
And loving you just crossed my mind.
No I don't have a minute, but I've got lots of time,
And loving you just crossed my mind.
Loving you just crossed my mind,
Loving you just crossed my mind.
