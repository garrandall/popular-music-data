Everybody's gotta live
And everybody's gonna die
Everybody just wanna have a good, good time
I think you know the reason why
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh


Everybody's gotta live
And everybody's gonna die
Everybody's gotta live
I think you know the reason why
Yeah, sometimes the going gets so good, yeah
But then again it get pretty rough, yeah
But when I have you in my arms, baby
You know I just can't, I just can't get enough


Everybody's gotta live
And everybody's gonna die
Everybody’s gonna try to have a good, good time
I think you know the reason why


Saw a blind man standin' on the corner, baby, yeah
And he couldn't hardly tie his shoes, yeah
Harmonica and guitar strapped around his neck
But he sure could, he sure could play the blues


Everybody's gotta live
And everybody's gonna die
Everybody's gonna try to have a good, good time
I think you know the reason why, yeah


Feel like I've seen a million sunsets, yeah
If you're with me I'll never go away
That's when I stopped and I took a look at my baby
She said, "If you're with me, I won't go away"


Because everybody's gotta live
And everybody's gonna die
Everybody's gonna try to have a good, good time
I think you know the reason why
