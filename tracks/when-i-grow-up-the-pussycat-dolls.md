Boys call you sexy (What's up, sexy?)
And you don't care what they say (Ha, ha)
See, every time you turn around, they screaming your name
Just call you sexy (What's up, sexy?)
And you don't care what they say (Yeah)
See, every time you turn around, they screaming your name (Darkchild)


Now I've got a confession (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
When I was young I wanted attention (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
And I promised myself that I'd do anything (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Anything at all for them to notice me (Ha, ha, ha, ha)


But I ain't complaining (Oh)
We all wanna be famous (Oh)
So, go ahead and say what you wanna say (Oh)
You know what it's like to be nameless (Oh)
Want them to know what your name is (Oh)
'Cause see, when I was younger, I would say


When I grow up, I wanna be famous
I wanna be a star, I wanna be in movies
When I grow up, I wanna see the world
Drive nice cars, I wanna have groupies
When I grow up, be on TV
People know me, be on magazines
When I grow up, fresh and clean
Number one chick when I step out on the scene


But be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it (Hey)
You just might get it (Hey)
You just might get it (Hey)
But be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it (Hey)
You just might get it (Hey)
You just might get it (Hey)
Get it?


They used to tell me I was silly (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
'Til I popped up on the TV (La, la, la, la)
I always wanted to be a superstar (Superstar) (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Who knew that singing songs would get me this far? (La, la, la, la)


But I ain't complaining (Oh)
We all wanna be famous (Oh)
So, go ahead and say what you wanna say (Oh)
You know what it's like to be nameless (Oh)
Want them to know what your name is (Oh)
'Cause see, when I was younger, I would say


When I grow up, I wanna be famous
I wanna be a star, I wanna be in movies
When I grow up, I wanna see the world
Drive nice cars, I wanna have groupies
When I grow up, be on TV
People know me, be on magazines
When I grow up, fresh and clean
Number one chick when I step out on the scene


But be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it (Hey)
You just might get it (Hey)
You just might get it (Hey)
But be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it (Hey)
You just might get it (Hey)
You just might get it (Hey)
Get it?


I see them staring at me
Oh, I'm a trendsetter
Yes, this is true 'cause what I do
No one can do it better
You can talk about me
'Cause I'm a hot topic
I see you watching me, watching me
And I know you want it


When I grow up, I wanna be famous
I wanna be a star, I wanna be in movies
When I grow up, I wanna see the world
Drive nice cars, I wanna have groupies
When I grow up, be on TV
People know me, be on magazines
When I grow up, fresh and clean
Number one chick when I step out on the scene


But be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it (Hey)
You just might get it (Hey)
You just might get it (Hey)
But be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it (Hey)
You just might get it (Hey)
You just might get it (Hey)
Get it?


When I grow up, I wanna be famous
I wanna be a star, I wanna be in movies
When I grow up, I wanna see the world
Drive nice cars, I wanna have groupies
When I grow up, be on TV
People know me, be on magazines
When I grow up, fresh and clean
Number one chick when I step out on the scene


But be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it (Hey)
You just might get it (Hey)
You just might get it (Hey)
But be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it (Hey)
You just might get it (Hey)
You just might get it (Hey)
Get it?
(Darkchild)
