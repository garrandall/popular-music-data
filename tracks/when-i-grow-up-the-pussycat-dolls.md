Boys call you sexy (what's up, sexy?)
And you don't care what they say (quit it!).
See everytime you turn around
They're screaming your name...

Now I've got a confession (ha, ha, ha, ha),
When I was young, I wanted attention (ha, ha, ha, ha).
And I promised myself that I'd do anything (ha, ha, ha, ha),
Anything at all for them to notice me (ha, ha, ha, ha).

But I ain't complaining,
We all wanna be famous.
So go ahead and say what you wanna say.
You don't know what it's like to be nameless,
Want them to know what your name is.
'Cause see, when I was younger, I would say

When I grow up, I wanna be famous,
I wanna be a star, I wanna be in movies.
When I grow up, I wanna see the world,
Drive nice cars, I wanna have groupies.
When I grow up, be on TV,
People know me, be on magazines.
When I grow up, fresh and clean,
Number one boy when I step out on the scene.

Be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it,
You just might get it, you just might get it.
Be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it,
You just might get it, you just might get it (get it).

They used to tell me I was silly (la, la, la, la),
Until I popped up on the TV (la, la, la, la).
I always wanted to be a superstar (la, la, la, la).
Who knew singing songs would get me this far? (la, la, la, la)

But I ain't complaining,
We all wanna be famous,
So go ahead and say what you wanna say.
You don't know what it's like to be nameless,
Want them to know what your name is.
'Cause see, when I was younger, I would say

When I grow up, I wanna be famous,
I wanna be a star, I wanna be in movies.
When I grow up, I wanna see the world,
Drive nice cars, I wanna have groupies.
When I grow up, be on TV,
People know me, be on magazines.
When I grow up, fresh and clean,
Number one boy when I step out on the scene.

Be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it,
You just might get it, you just might get it.
Be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it,
You just might get it, you just might get it.

I see them staring at me.
Oh, I'm a trendsetter,
Yes, this is true, 'cause what I do
No one can do it better.
You can talk about me.
'Cause I'm a hot topic,
I see you watching me, watching me,
And I know you want it!

When I grow up, I wanna be famous,
I wanna be a star, I wanna be in movies.
When I grow up, I wanna see the world,
Drive nice cars, I wanna have groupies.
When I grow up, be on TV,
People know me, be on magazines.
When I grow up, fresh and clean,
Number one boy when I step out on the scene.

Be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it
You just might get it, you just might get it
Be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it
You just might get it, you just might get it
