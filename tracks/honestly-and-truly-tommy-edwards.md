Honestly and truly
I am yours alone
Honestly and truly
I call you my own

There is no other one
That I am thinking of
You're all that I desire
There is no other love

Honestly and truly
Glad to know you care
Honestly and truly
The happiness we share

Makes this a wonderful world
My wish has come true
Honestly and truly, I love you

Honestly and truly
Glad to know you care
Honestly and truly
The happiness we share

Makes this a wonderful world
My wish has come true
Honestly and truly, I love you
