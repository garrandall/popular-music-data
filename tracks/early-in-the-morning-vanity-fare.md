Evening, is a time of day
I find nothing much to say

Don't know what to do
But I come too


When its sunny in the morning
Over by the window, day is dawning
When I feel the air
I feel that life is very good to me, you know?

In the sun, theres so much yellow
Something in the early morning meadow
Tells me that today you're on your way
And you'll be coming home, home to me


Night time, isn't clear to me
I find nothing dear to me

Don't know what to do
But I come too


When its sunny in the morning
Very, very early without warning
I can feel a newly born vibration
Sneaking up on me, again

Theres a songbird on my pillow
I can see the funny weeping willow
I can see the sun you're on your way
And you'll be coming home


Evening, is a time of day
I find nothing much to say

Don't know what to do
But I come too


When its sunny in the morning
Over by the window, day is dawning
When I feel the air
I feel that life is very good to me, you know?

In the sun, theres so much yellow
Something in the early morning meadow
Tells me that today you're on your way
And you'll be coming home to me

When its sunny in the morning
Very, very early without warning
I can feel a newly born vibration
Sneaking up on me, again

Theres a songbird on my pillow
I can see the funny weeping willow
I can see the sun you're on your way
And you'll be coming home
