Welcome to starblocks
Its young dirty
Whos this?
Its young dirty!
Oh okay what you need?
Hey I need some of them thangs, mayn
How many of 'em?
Two of 'em, give me two
I got you, pull on around to the window pimp
Aight shawty
Ay ay ay joc what up patman
Cuh cuz out here say he need two of them thangs
O yea he want two of 'em?
Yea, ay joc
Whatup?
You know tha motto!
Yea
Hustle by any means nigga


First I take order like the coffee shop
Then I steam it up and cook it like the coffee shop
And then I sevre it out the window like the coffee shop
(yea im comin in got my rims sittin real big)
And it aint no returns at the coffee shop
Man I make that paper stack up at my coffee shop
One hit n they'll be back to the coffee shop
(yea im comin in got my rims sittin real big)


Okayy
Its just another day at the coffee shop
I grab them coffee beans, time to heat them coffee pots
Turn them lights on, j's rush the parkin lot
This the neighborhoods number one stop n shop
No regular, we only serve the best
For the low low, cheaper than the rest!
Im takin orders, tell me whos next
Only cash, no credit, no checks
When your car stop, welcome to starblocks
You wanna triple your knot? invest in our stock
N now we doin numbers, like the closeout
Make sure you shop wit me, before its sold out

Cook it in the morning, sell it durin midday
Whipped cream the same color as your latte
I tell em vamonos, thas rapido, you need some mota? you gon call gorilla zoe
You can get the coca if you got tha get-it-green
Colombian, and I aint talkin coffee beans 12 to 12
Its always someone on the scene
Starblocks, we get it out by any means
Coffee shop, trap spot, hand to hand, get my guap
Pockets still ounce for ounce
Decafinated off the top
Rockstar, rollin rocks
Piano keys, work the block
Welcome to starblocks, we trap like the coffee shop...let go, see

Ah ha okay
Everybody on the block know my nickname
When you drop by just ask for whip game
And all my money get counted when the shifts change
They get into it, imma let my 4/5th bang
If you need the number 1-800-starblocks
Coca latte damned to make ya heart stop
And now the haters hot so they run n tell the cops
Shut this shit down, we set up shop on another block
