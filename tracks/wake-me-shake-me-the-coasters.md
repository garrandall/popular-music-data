Why don't you wake me, shake me?
Don't let me sleep too late
Gotta get up in the morning
About a quarter to eight

(Don't you know I'm bound)
I'm bound to my job
(My boss)
My boss is a big, fat slob
Can't even be a minute late
Or the boss will blow his gate

Why don't you wake me, shake me?
Don't let me sleep too late
Gotta get up in the morning
About a quarter to eight

(Don't you know I'm bound)
I'm bound to my garbage truck
(I got a lot)
Got a lot of cans to pick up
Can't even be a minute late
Or the boss will blow his gate

Why don't you wake me, shake me?
Gotta get up in the morning time
About a quarter to eight

I had a dream, I had a dream
I said, "I looked over yonder"
What did I see
I said, "Two big garbage trucks"
I said, "Are coming after me"

Picking up cans, I said, "Side by side
Why don't you swing down sweet garbage truck?
And let your buddy ride"

Why don't you wake me, shake me?
Don't let me sleep too late
Gotta get up in the morning
About a quarter to eight

(Don't you know I'm bound)
I'm bound to my job
(My boss)
My boss is a big, fat slob
Can't even be a minute late
Or the boss will blow his gate

Why don't you wake me, shake me?
Gotta get up in the morning time
About a quarter to eight

Why don't you wake me, shake me?
Gotta get up in the morning time
About a quarter to eight

Why don't you wake me, shake me?
