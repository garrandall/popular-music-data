If you ever change your mind
About leaving, leaving me behind


Baby (Oh), bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)


I know I laughed when you left
But now I know I only hurt myself


Baby (Oh), bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)


I'll give you jewelry and money, too
That ain't all, that ain't all I'll do for you


Baby if you (Oh), bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)


You know I'll always be your slave
'Till I'm buried, buried in my grave


Oh honey (Oh), bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)


One more thing, I tried to treat you right
But you stayed out, stayed out day and night


But I forgive you (Oh), Bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)
