Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections, every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know


The way that Gucci look on you, amazing
But nothing can compare to when you're naked
Now a Backwood and some Henny got you faded
Saying you're the one for me, I need to face it


Started when we were younger
Swear to God that I loved her
Sorry that your mom found out
Guess that we just really had the thunder
Ain't nobody else that I'd be under
Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Beautiful, beautiful night right now
No, no, no


Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections, every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know




Oh my God, where did the time go?
I wish the hours would go slow
How is it 6 AM?
Your touch is heaven-sent
Beautiful, beautiful sight right now
Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Got the angels singing ohah right now like, oh
And this is why weâ€™ve got to touch (Ah)
Sometimes words are not enough (No)
Painted in your golden kiss, honey dripping from your lips
I thank God and my lucky stars
Darling, don't you know what you are?
Yeah, baby, you are


Hey (Hey, baby)
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel (Oh)
Love your imperfections, every angle (Baby, baby)
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know (Yeah, baby)
So I just had to let you know


The way that Gucci look on you amazing (Yeah, yeah)
But nothing can compare to when you're naked
(Nothing can compare, you're better when you, hey, Oh)
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know (Yeah)
So I just had to let you know (Oh, know, yeah)

I just had to let you know
Swear to God you're beautiful, yeah
