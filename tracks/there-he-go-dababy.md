Huh? (We got London on da Track), okay
Look (I'm in London got my beat from London)


You know I ain't never had shit (Okay)
Now I'm somewhere in a meeting getting my ass kissed (No Homo)
By a white man 'cause his daughter fuck with my ad-libs (Uh-oh)
I done dropped dick in her friend, I'm like, "My bad, sis" (My bad)
That nigga act like he too good, even for a bad bitch (Uh-huh)


I'm a buy a Lambo 'fore this album hit the fans, bitch
Tell the valet park my shit at the front, I'ma hit the gas bitch (Let's go)
I just did five shows, three days, came out with the bag, bitch (Bag)
Pockets swole, 45K and a four-five, so I sag, bitch
If a fat bitch know how to get some money, I'll fuck a fat bitch (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Gotta show coming up in London and got London on da Track, bitch (Yuh)
I give a fan a high five in the airport, she did a backflip (Oh my God, ah)
I just went Platinum and I'm coming back like


Huh? Okay
Looking for me?
Huh? Okay
Looking for me?
Here I go


Man, fuck Baby
That little nigga in there (Salt)
She really selling pussy, she act like she selling swimwear (Okay)
A couple thousand to your name, act like a millionaire
But I don't knock your hustle, get it out the mud, I been there (Uh-huh)
Man, I'm so tired of a nigga talking 'bout who broke like we ain't all came up from the bottom (Okay)
We came up, I give 'em hope
And way before a nigga signed, I made a rhyme, I was providing for my side (Uh-huh)
No, I had them low, and they had them high
You shop with me, you ain't gotta lie (Yeah)
Now a nigga legit, huh
Fifty thousand just to walk through and do my one-two on yo bitch, huh
And bougie hoes, they wanna fuck with me, now I got 'em all on my dick now
Like Lil Baby, four pockets all full of money, can't fit now
Man, I pull up, niggas howlin'


Huh? Okay
Looking for me?
Huh? Okay
Looking for me?
Here I go


You know I ain't never had shit, okay
Now I'm somewhere in a meeting getting my ass kissed (No Homo)
By a white man 'cause his daughter fuck with my ad-libs (Uh-oh)
I done dropped dick in her friend, I'm like, "My bad, sis" (My bad)
That nigga act like he too good, even for a bad bitch
