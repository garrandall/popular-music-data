Hey, gotta, gotta pay back
(The big payback)
Revenge, I'm mad
(The big payback)
Got to get back, I need some get back

Payback, payback
(The big payback)
That's it, payback
Revenge, I'm mad

You get down with my girlfriend, that ain't right
Hollarin', cussin', you wanna fight
Payback is a thing you gotta see
Hell, never do any damn thing to me

Sold me out, takin' change
(Yes you did)
Told me ya did, they had it all arranged
The hand me down, and that's a fact

And now you're pumped, you gotta get ready
For the big payback
(The big payback)
That's where I am, oh, the big payback
(The big payback)

I can do wheelin', I can do dealin'
(Yes we can)
But I don't do no damn squealin'
I can dig rappin', I'm ready, I can dig scrappin'
But I can't dig that backstabbin'
(Oh no)

Now brother get ready! That's a fact
Get ready you mother, for the big payback
(The big payback)
Hey, let me hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em

Hey, hey, hey

Lord, lord, you took my money, you got my honey
Don't want me to see what you doing to me
I can get back I gotta deal with you, gotta deal with you
Gotta deal with you, I gotta deal with you

Hey let me tell ya
Get down with my woman, that ain't right
You hollarin' and cussin'
You wanna fight
