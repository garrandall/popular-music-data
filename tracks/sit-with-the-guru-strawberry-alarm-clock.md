Life's created, automated
Yesterday's invalidated
Hip mankind on, turn your mind on
Sit with the guru (guru, guru)
Meditation, ooh
High, high where eagles fly
Leave today untouched in the sky
Stretch out your mind to humanity
How many tomorrows can you see?

Good life livin', party givin'
No one walks who can be driven
Blunt the starkness, light the darkness
Sit with the guru (guru, guru)
Meditation, ooh
High, high where eagles fly
Leave today untouched in the sky
Stretch out your mind to humanity
How many tomorrows can you see?
How many tomorrows can you see?

Pussy willows, dew-kissed pillows
Silver cloud puffs up and billows
Full potential, transcendental
Sit with the guru (guru, guru)
Meditation, ooh
High, high where eagles fly
Leave today untouched in the sky
Stretch out your mind to humanity
How many tomorrows can you see?
How many tomorrows can you see?
