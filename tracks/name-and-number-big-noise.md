Tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me
Tell me, girl

You could call me crazy
And maybe acting like a fool
You broke my heart a thousand times
You thought by now
I'd learn the golden rule

One way conversations
Found my way in the dark
Unnecessary complications
Are you happy now, real happy now
You left your mark


I don't know your name
Don't know your number
You're my lover
I don't know your name
But you broke my heart

I don't understand it
Why I'm acting in this way
I'm only wasting questions
It doesn't make no difference anyway

Searching for a reason
Can't take another night alone
No use in pretending
I need you now, believe me now
I can't be on my own



Yes, you did, yeah

Don't know your name
Don't know your number
Don't know your name
Don't know your number



Oh, yes, you did

I don't know your name
Don't know your number
No, no, no, be my lover
I don't know your name
But you broke my heart
You broke my heart, girl

I don't know your name
What's your name
Don't know you're number
Tell me, tell me, tell me, girl

I don't know your name
But you broke my heart
It's breaking my whole heart...
