You are under my power
It is the power of love

Eyes that hypnotize
And all it takes is just once glance
Just one look at him
Puts me in a lover's trance

Now listen, no rabbits in his hand
No pigeons up his sleeve
But you better believe
When I prove he can do so much

My baby must be a magician
'Cause he's sure got the magic touch

Oh, my morale was low
Then he appeared just like a genie
His love has the power
He's my private great Houdini

No reading decks of cards
No cords that disappear
No special gear
Like Alladin's lamp and such

But my baby must be a magician
'Cause he's sure got the magic touch

Whenever I'm feeling bad
My baby simply kisses me
And then Presto, Chango, Alakazam
I'm alright again, oh, yes I am, yes I am alright

No mystic crystal ball
No long black flowing cape
But I can't escape
From his tender loving touch

Oh my baby must be a magician
'Cause he's sure got the magic touch
Say my baby must be a magician
'Cause he's sure got the magic touch
