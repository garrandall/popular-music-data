I'll be seeing you
Hey don't forget your coat
I'll be seeing you
Feels like it's turning cold

I hate that you're leaving
With so much unsaid and
This strange empty feeling
Won't let me forget
That I'll be seeing you

I'll be seeing you
Oh, that beautiful smile
I'll be seeing you
Sure as I'm seeing you now

Around every cornor
Wherever I go
Every moment of everyday
Darlin' I know
That I'll be seeing you

I'll be seeing you
Oh the nights I've cried
But maybe, just maybe
In time, I'll be fine

I'll be seeing you
When I close my eyes
I'll be seeing you
I've got you memorized

I'll always love you
I know you know that
And I know that in my heart
That you're not coming back
But in everything I do

I'll be seeing you...
