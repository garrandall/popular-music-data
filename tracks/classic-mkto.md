Hey! Where's the drums?

Oh whoa-oh-oh-oh

Let's go!


Ooh girl you're shining
Like a 5th avenue diamond
And they don't make you like they used to
You're never going out of style

Ooh pretty baby
This world might've gone crazy
The way you save me
Who can blame me
When I just wanna make you smile?


I wanna thrill you like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye
Like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this


You're over my head
I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
One of a kind, living in a world gone plastic
Baby you're so classic
Baby you're so classic
Baby you,
Baby you're so classic


Four dozen roses
Anything for you to notice
All the way to serenade you
Doing it Sinatra style

I'm a pick you up in a Cadillac
Like a gentleman bringin' glamour back
Keep it reel to reel in the way I feel
I could walk you down the aisle


I wanna thrill you like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye
Like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this


You're over my head
I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
It's love on rewind,
Everything is so throwback-ish (I kinda like it, like it)
Out of my league
Old school chic
Like a movie star
From the silver screen
You're one of a kind living in a world gone plastic
Baby you're so classic
Baby you're so classic
Baby you're so classic


Baby you're class and baby you're sick
I never met a girl like you ever 'till we met
A star in the 40s, centerfold in the 50s
Got me tripping out like the sixties
Hippies, Queen of the discotheque
A 70s dream and an 80s best
Hepburn, BeyoncÃ©, Marilyn, Massive
Girl you're timeless, just so classic


You're over my head I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
It's love on rewind,
Everything is so throwback-ish (I kinda like it, like it)
Out of my league
Old school chic
Like a movie star
From the silver screen
You're one of a kind living in a world gone plastic
Baby you're so classic
Whoa oh oh (Yeah, yeah)
Baby you're so classic (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah
Baby you're so classic
Uuuuuuh uh uh
