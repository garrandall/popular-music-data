I've had my taste of independence
Since the day I set you free
Now I don't bare the least resemblance
To the man I used to be

'Cause baby, things look much different now
On this side of goodbye
Can't you find it in your heart, somehow
To give us just one more try?

I thought I knew just what I wanted
When I left you standing there
But now each night my soul is haunted
By the dreams we used to share

And baby, things look much different now
On this side of goodbye
Can't you find it in your heart, somehow
To give our love just one more try?

I've got to find a way to make you hear me
Gotta reach you somehow
I need you to forgive me

For my mistake I've already paid
Too much of my soul

Baby, don't make me
Don't make me beg

Baby, things look much different now
On this side of goodbye
Can't you find it in your heart, somehow
To give our love just one more try?

Now baby, things look so much different now
On this side of goodbye
Things look so much different now
Oh baby
