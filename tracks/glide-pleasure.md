I'm physically, dramatically, undeniably
Attracted to you, did you hear?
So profoundly, thoroughly visibly
Attracted to you, did you hear?

The way you hold your keys, your coffee cup
Even the tempo of your walk
The way your tattoos lay upon your skin
Even the tempo of your thought

Sweet pleasure
Sweet pleasure
Bring it on, bring it on, on, on, on, on
Sweet pleasure
Let me lose myself in your embrace
Sweet pleasure
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it home

You satisfy, gratify
Turn all my, world downside up
You're so colorful, natural
Keep giving me a bellyful of your love

The way you feed, glide, breeze across me
In the softness of your stare
To clarify, you make my
Senses naked, my soul bare

Sweet pleasure
Sweet pleasure
Bring it on, bring it on, on, on, on, on
Sweet pleasure
How i feel for you i can't explain
Sweet pleasure
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it home

Bring it on, bring it on, (bring it on) on, on, on, on
Bring it on, bring it on, (bring it on) on, on, on, on

I'm captured by your whisper
Into a mind field of love
Into danger
Into us

Sweet pleasure
Sweet pleasure
Bring it on, bring it on, on, on, on, on
Sweet pleasure
How i feel for you i can't explain
Sweet pleasure
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on

Sweet pleasure
Sweet pleasure
Bring it on, bring it on, on, on, on, on
Sweet pleasure
Gotta feel, gotta feel your warm embrace
Sweet pleasure
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it home
