Car won't start, out of gas
Check past two, reserves won't last
Caught the bus to go downtown
Bus broke down, downtown bound
Left the bus, flagged down a cab
The driver said, "I want all your cash"

Don't let that keep you behind
Glide, glide on by
Glide, glide on by
Don't let that keep you behind
Glide, glide on by
Glide, glide on by

The next time you blow your mind
Glide, glide on by
Glide, glide on by
The next time you blow your mind
Glide
Glide
