What I don't know
You could tell me
What I should know
If you let me know
How you feel
How I love you

And what I don't know
Couldn't hurt me
But what I could show
If you let me know
Just how you feel
How I love you

Come on and say it
Sooner or later
You're gonna need it
Girl, you've got to make up your mind
You gotta choose
You're gonna lose everything

Tell me
Just one good reason
Why you won't say
What you feel inside
Dismiss your pride
Why won't you tell me?

Come on and say it
Sooner or later
Ah, you're gonna need it, alright
You've got to make up your mind
You gotta choose
You're gonna lose everything

Come on and say it (Oh yeah)
You're gonna need it
You come on and say it
The sooner the better (Baby, baby, baby, baby)

Come on and say it (Whoa)
Come on and say it (Right now)
Come on and say it (I know you want it, girl)
Come on and say it (Whoa)
Come on and say it (Baby)
Come on and say it
Come on and say it (Whoa-ooh)
