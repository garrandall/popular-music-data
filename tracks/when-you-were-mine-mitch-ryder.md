When you were mine...
I gave you all of my money
Time after time...
You done me wrong
It's just like a train...
You let all my friends, come over and eat

And you were so strange...
You didn't have the decency to change the sheets

Oh girl, when you were mine...
I used to let you wear, all my clothes
You were so fine...
Maybe that's the reason that it hurt me so

CHORUS:
I know, that you're going with another guyyyy
Don't care, 'cause I love you, baby, that's no lie...
I love you more than I did, when you were mine

When you were mine...
You were kinda-sorta my best friend
So I was blind...
I let you fool around
I never cared...
I never was the kind to make a fuss
When he was there...
Sleeping in be-tween the two of us

CHORUS

When you were mine...
You were all I ever wanted to do
Now I spend my time...
Following him when he's with you

CHORUS

Love you more than I did, when you were mine, (oh no)

Love you more than I did, when you were mine, (oh no)
Love you more than I did, when you were mine, (oh girl)
Love you more than I did, when you were mine, (oh girl)
Love you, love you more than I did, when you were mine, (oh girl
