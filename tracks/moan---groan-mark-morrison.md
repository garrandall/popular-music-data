Ah
This ain't no love song girl
Wow wow wow
This is for the G's, the bedroom G's

If you wanna to take me home
You better make me moan and groan, (oh oh oh)
If you wanna to take me home
Your better make me groan and moan, (oh yeah, and moan)
If you need it, need it, need it
It's right here
All you have to do is ask
Have no fear
I will show, show you, show you, (Whoa)
What I can do (ohooh
And if you still don't believe
That's cool,
You fool,
But you gotta wet me up and wet me down
I can do it (down oh yeah)
Then you gotta dry me up with some foreplay
Any problem
I can solve it
Push it, work it, hurt it, all night, all night, all day
Show me how you love a woman
Till the morning light (morning light, morning light)

If you wanna take me home you better make me groan and moan (oh yeah)
If you wanna take me home you better make me moan (whoa)
Gonna moan
If you wanna take me home you better make moan
Make me moan
If you wanna take me home you better make me groan

Cause I told her, told her, told her (whoa)
What I've got
If you want to come and see
Just open my drawers (hahaha)
Cause I've got, got it, got it, got it, going on, going on
And baby
If you dare to play
Let's just go my place

You'd better lick me up and lick me down
I will lick you
Then you gotta rub me up with some foreplay
Rub it on, rub it on (oh
Make it, break it, shake it, all night, all night, all night
Show me you can love a woman to the morning light, morning light,
It's her night

If you wanna take me home you gotta make me moan (gonna moan)
If you wanna take me home you gotta make me groan (yes I'm ready)
If you wanna take me home you gotta make me moan (make me moan)
Wow wow wow,
Make me moan
Make me groan
Take me home
Yeah
Make me moan
Take me home
Yeah,

But you gotta lick me up and lick me down
I will lick you
Then you gotta rub me up with some foreplay
Rub it on, rub it on
Make it, break it, shake it, all night, all night, all night.
Show me you can love a woman to the morning light, morning light

If you wanna take me home you better make me moan (make me moan)
