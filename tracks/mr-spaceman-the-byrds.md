Woke up this morning with light in my eyes
And then realized it was still dark outside
It was a light comin'down from the sky
I don't know who or why

Must be those strangers that come every night
Whose saucers shaped light put people up tight
Leave blue green footprints that glow in the dark
I hope they get home all right

Hey Mr.Spaceman, won't you please take me along
I won't do anything wrong
Hey Mr.Spaceman, won't you please take me along
For a ride

Woke up this mornin', I was feeling quite weird
Had flies in my beer, my tooth paste was smeared
I opened my window, they'd written my name
Said: "So long, we'll see you again".

Hey Mr.Spaceman, won't you please take me along
I won't do anything wrong
Hey Mr.Spaceman, won't you please take me along
For a ride

Hey Mr.Spaceman, won't you please take me along
I won't do anything wrong
Hey Mr.Spaceman, won't you please take me along
For a ride
