Love is like candy on a shelf
You want to taste and help yourself
The sweetest things are there for you
Help yourself, take a few
That's what I want you to do.

We're always told repeatedly
The very best in life is free
And if you want to prove it's true
Baby I'm telling you
This is what you should do
Just help yourself to my lips
To my arms just say the word, and they are yours
Just help yourself to the love,
In my heart your smile has opened up the door
The greatest wealth that exists in the world,
Could never buy what I can give
Just help yourself to my lips
To my arms, and then lets really start to live

Allllllllll right. Yeah

My heart has love enough for two
More than enough for me and you
I'm rich with love, a millionaire
I've so much, it's unfair
Why don't you take a share
Just help yourself to my lips
To my arms just say the word, and they are yours
Just help yourself to the love,
In my heart your smile has opened up the door
The greatest wealth that exists in the world
Could never buy what I can give
So help yourself to my lips, to my arms
And then lets really start to live
Just help yourself to my lips
To my arms just say the word, and they are yours
Just help yourself to the love

In my heart your smile...
