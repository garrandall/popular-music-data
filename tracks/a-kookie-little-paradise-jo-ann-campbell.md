Jukebox playing in the jungle
No charge, absolutely free
Soft drinks bubbling
Down the mountain
To the Carribean Sea

(CHORUS)
What a kookie little paradise
What a kookie little paradise
Never was an island half as nice
As my kookie little paradise

Sportcars, one for everybody
No speed limit on the beach
But there's lots of education
Making love is what they teach

(CHORUS)

Boyfriends, any girl can have one
Girlfriends, one for every guy
Ice cream loaded with bananas
And there's always pizza pie

(CHORUS)

That's my kookie little paradise
I love my kookie little paradise
What a kookie little paradise
