I know all there is to know about the crying game
I've had my share of the crying game
First there kisses
Then there are sighs
And then before
You know where you are
Your sayin' goodbye

One day soon I'm gonna tell the moon about the crying game
And if he knows
Maybe he'll explain
Why there are heartaches
Why there are tears
And what to do

To stop feelin' blue
When love dissapears

First there are kisses
Then there are sighs
And then before
You know where you are
Your sayin' goodbye

Don't want no more of the crying game
Don't want no more of the crying game
