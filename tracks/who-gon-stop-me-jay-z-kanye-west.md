This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord
Til I die Iâma fuckinâ ball
Now who gonâ stop me?
Who gonâ stop me huh?
Who gonâ stop me?
Who gonâ stop me huh?


Black cards, black cars,
Black on black, black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what thatâs for?


Who gonâ stop me huh?


Who gonâ stop me, huh?


Yeah, who gonâ stop me?
No brakes, I need, State Farm
So many watches I need 8 arms
One neck but got 8 charms


Who gonâ stop me, huh?


Niggas talkinâ, they bitch made, Ix-nay off my dicks-nay
Thatâs pig Latin, itch-bay
Who gonâ stop me huh?
Last night ainât go so well
Got kicked up out the hotel
Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert
Yes! Tell Howard Cosell
You just a commentator, if you getting paper
Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
In some relations, you just supposed to say none
Heard she fucked the doorman
Well thatâs cool I fucked the waitress
Heard Yeezy was racist, well, I guess thatâs on one basis
I only like green faces

This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord
Til I die Iâma fuckinâ ball

Now who gonâ stop me?
Who gonâ stop me huh?
Who gonâ stop me?
Who gonâ stop me huh?


Black cards, black cars
Black on black, black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what thatâs for


Yâall weed purple, my money purple
Yâall Steve Urkel, Iâm Oprah circle
I wrote the verse, that I hope will hurt you


Who gone stop me huh?
Beat the odds, best the Feds
It wouldnât be wise, to bet against the kid
Start me broke, I bet I get rich
Night shift, 6 to 6
Gimmie one shot, one pot
Iâll show up in all white, wearing no socks
No ceiling, new coupe
They know Iâm a dope boy
They donât have no proof
Iâm 3 steps removed, I know how to move
Itâs looking like, I donât know how to lose
Iâm winning again, Iâm at the Wynn
Iâm at the table, Iâm gambling,
Lucky lefty, I expect a 7,
I went through hell, Iâm expecting heaven, Iâm owed,
Iâm throwed and I stuck to the G-code,
Iâm here, oh yeah, I promise I ainât going nowhere,
OK here, like a hare, like a rabbit, I like karats
Iâm allergic to having bunny ears,
Like broke, like nope, like ha,
I ainât no joke, I canât be stopped
Like nope, like nope
To the beat Noahâ¦

2 seats in the 911, no limit on the black card
Told yâall I was gonna go HAM, told the ocean was my backyard
No lies in my verses, please pardon all the curses
Shit gotta come some way, fuck, when you growing up worthless
Middle finger to my old life, special shout out to my old head
If it wasnât for your advice, a nigga would have been so dead
Iâm living life, til these niggas kill me
Turn this up, if these niggas feel me
Iâm riding dirty, trying to get filthy
Pablo Picasso, Rothkos, Rilkes
Graduated to the MOMA
And I did all of this, without a diploma
Graduated from the corner
Yâall can play me for a motherfuckinâ fool if you wanna,
Street smart, and Iâm book smart
Could have been a chemist, cause I cook smart
Only thing to stop me is me,
And Iâma stop when the hook start
Hold up


This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the lord
Til I die, Iâma fuckinâ ball

Now who gonâ stop me?
Who gonâ stop me huh?
Who gonâ stop me?
Who gonâ stop me huh?


Black cards, black cars
Black on black, black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what thatâs for
