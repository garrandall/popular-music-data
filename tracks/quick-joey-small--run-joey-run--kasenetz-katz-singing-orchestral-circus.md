Quick Joey Small went over the wall
With a ball and a chain behind him
Quick Joey Small went over the wall
Send the dogs right out to find him
In a striped prision suit with no room to move
He headed for the highway
With his chain still dragin'
He thumbed down a wagon
Said...well you're goin my way
And they say now
Refrain:
Run Joey, Joey run run
The hounds are on your trail
Jump-up Jump-up
Run Joey, Joey run run
They're gonna send you back to jail
Sheriff got a shotgun, he do
He'll fill you full of lead son, it's true
He's also got a blackjack, he's mad
He'd bust your head with one wack
Here I go now
Run Joey, Joey run run the hounds are on your trail
Sweet Mary Jane was goin' insane
When she heard of Joey's jail break
But she knew all the while 'cause
She sent him a file
Baked inside a fudge cake
(Repeat Refrain)
Sheriff Jack Banes was a light on brains
But he knew one thing for sure
He took some toughs and a pair of handcuffs
And headed straight for Mary Jane's door
(Repeat Refrain)
(Repeat Refrain)
