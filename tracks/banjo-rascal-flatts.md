When I lose my smile
When my thoughts get jumbled
When the air and BS get too thick
Can’t take a breath
Without getting sick
I’ve had enough
With this concrete jungle
I drop my truck in drive
I pick up my baby
She jumps in with a kiss and a hey
We exit off that old highway
Sometimes you gotta go
Beyond the pavement


You gotta go deep
Way on back
Cross a few creeks
And a couple little shacks
You gotta get lost
Way on out
Crickets and frogs
Yeah you’re gettin’ close now
And you kick it into four wheel drive
When you run out of road
And you go, and you go and you go-go-go
‘Til you hear a banjo


It ain’t on no map
And I’m glad it isn’t
Leave the phone
And the GPS
Those satellites
Ain’t found it yet
Got our own little
Piece of heaven hidden


You gotta go deep
Way on back
Cross a few creeks
And a couple little shacks
You gotta get lost
Way on out
Crickets and frogs
Yeah you’re gettin’ close now
And you kick it into four wheel drive
When you run out of road
And you go, and you go and you go-go-go
‘Til you hear a banjo
