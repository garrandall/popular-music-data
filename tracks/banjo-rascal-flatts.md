When I lose my smile
When my thoughts get jumbled
When the air and BS get too thick
Canât take a breath without getting sick
Iâve had enough with this concrete jungle
I drop my truck in drive
I pick up my baby
She jumps in with a kiss and a hey
We exit off that old highway
Sometimes you gotta go beyond the pavement


You gotta go deep
Way on back
Cross a few creeks
And a couple little shacks
You gotta get lost
Way on out
Crickets and frogs
Yeah youâre gettinâ close now
And you kick it into four wheel drive when you run out of road
And you go, and you go and you go-go-go
âTil you hear a banjo

It ainât on no map
And Iâm glad it isnât
Leave the phone and the GPS,
Those satellites ainât found it yet,
Got our own little piece of heaven hidden


Yeah, you gotta go deep
Way on back
Cross a few creeks
And a couple little shacks
You gotta get lost
Way on out
Crickets and frogs
Yeah youâre gettinâ close now
And you kick it into four wheel drive when you run out of road
And you go, and you go and you go-go-go
âTil you hear a banjo

You gotta go deep
Way on back
Cross a few creeks
And a couple little shacks
You gotta get lost
Way on out
Crickets and frogs
Yeah youâre gettinâ close now
And you kick it into four wheel drive when you run out of road
And you go, and you go and you go and you go and you go

Oooh hoo

âTil you hear that banjo
Kick it

You gotta go deep
Way on back
Oh oh oh
Cross a few creeks
And a couple little shacks
Oh oh oh
Four wheel drive when you run out of road
Oh oh oh
And you go and you go, and you go
âTil you hear that, âtil you hear that
âTil you hear that banjo
