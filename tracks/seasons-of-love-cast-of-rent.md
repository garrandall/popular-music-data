525,600 minutes
525,000 moments so dear
525,600 minutes
How do you measure, measure a year?

In daylights, in sunsets, in midnights, in cups of coffee
In inches, in miles, in laughter, in strife
In 525,600 minutes
How do you measure a year in the life?

How about love?
How about love?
How about love?
Measure in love
Seasons of love
Seasons of love


525,600 minutes
525,000 journeys to plan
525,600 minutes
How do you measure the life of a woman or man?


In truths that she learned, or in times that he cried
In bridges he burned, or the way that she died


It's time now to sing out
Though the story never ends
Let's celebrate, remember a year
In the life of friends


Remember the love
You got to, you got to remember the love
Remember the love
You know that love is a gift from up above
Remember the love
Share love, give love, spread love
Measure in love
Seasons of love
Seasons of love
Measure, measure your life in love
