Ain't no need of stopping, girl
There ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, okay

Met you out on Broadway
On the hottest night in town
We arrived solo
But we were being chased around
Saw you being caught up by some guy you used to know
Stepped in between the both of ya'll
Said "I'm leaving, do you wanna go?"

'Cause
I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity
Some shit's 'bout to go down
I'll be the one with the level head
The world can end now
Baby, we'll be living in The Walking Dead

'Cause I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies
I got you, I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies

I don't know if you remember this
But I was out of town
Flew in on a 3AM just to show up and hear your sounds
The multiple times, stop
Hit the set
You ain't headed that way
I can guarantee you that

I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity
Some shit's about to go down
I'll be the one with the level head
The world can end now
Baby, we'll be living in The Walking Dead

'Cause I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies
I got you, I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies

Ain't no need of stopping, girl
Can't nobody top it, girl
Ain't no better option, girl (okay)
Ain't nobody stopping, girl
This here when I drop in, girl
I work, work when I clock in, girl (okay)

I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity
Some shit's about to go down
I'll be the one with the level head
The world can end now
Baby, we'll be living in The Walking Dead

Now I wanna know everything
Don't leave a single detail out
I'll get my lighter, just fell out
It makes me a generous lover
Oh, I wanna see everything
So don't leave a single detail out
I want it all on the table
The personal way to
Wait

Ain't no need of stopping, girl
There ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, okay

'Cause I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies
I got you, I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies
