Come live with me and won't you be my love?
Share my bread and wine
Be wife to me, be life to me, be mine

Oh, come live with me and be my love
Let our dreams combine
Be great to me, be fate to me, be mine

With these hands
I'll build a roof to shield your head
Yes, and with these hands
I'll carve the wood for our baby's bed

Oh, come live with me and be my love
So I can love you all the time
Be part of me, girl, be the heart of me, be mine

Why don't y'all help me now?

I'll try to do my best for you, I swear, I promise you
And girl, didn't I tell you, I'll cry for you, don't you know?
I will accompany you, I say my whole life through

Oh, come live with me and won't you be my love?
Hey, hey, share my bread and wine
Be part of me, oh, be the heart of me, baby, please be mine
