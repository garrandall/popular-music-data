Sometimes I feel like this world is just one big gigantic merry-go-round
You gotta hold on tight or you get hurled through the air
Yeah, life is a 3 ring circus with clowns and freaks and camels and such
And you never know when you might be attacked by the bears

Give me love, give me love
Love me good
Give me love
Give me love, give me love
Love me good
Love me good

Give me love, give me love
Love me good
Give me love
Give me love, give me love
Love me good
Love me good

Sometimes I feel like I'm afraid of my own shadow and then
Sometimes I can feel as bold as Genghis Khan
But I could never live in a yurt on a diet of Mongolian barbecue
I conquer the world for a moment then the moment is gone

Give me love, give me love
Love me good
Give me love
Give me love, give me love
Love me good
Love me good

Give me love, give me love
Love me good
Give me love
Give me love, give me love
Love me good
Oh, you gotta love me

Give me love, give me love
Love me good
Love me good
Give me love, give me love
Love me good
Love me good

Give me love, give me love
Love me good
Give me love
Give me love, give me love
Love me good

Ha, ha, ha

Let us take a moment now to bow our heads and pray
If only to give thanks for making it through another day

Sometimes I wish I was in a movie or some 70's TV thing
Where everything gets neatly wrapped by the end of the show
Yeah, but this ain't Hollywood and this sure ain't the 'Brady Bunch'
And how this plot's gonna all pan out I don't really know

Give me love, give me love
Love me good
Give me love
Give me love, give me love
Love me good
Love me good

Give me love, give me love
Love me good
Give me love
Give me love, give me love
Love me good
Love me good

Oh, love me good
Give me love
Yeah, love me good
Oh, I need Your love
Oh, love me good
Oh, You gotta give me love
Yeah, love me good
Love me

Oh, I need Your love
I give my love to You

Oh, love me good
Yeah, love me good
Oh, love me good
Yeah, love me good

Love me good, yeah hey
Love me, love me, love me good
