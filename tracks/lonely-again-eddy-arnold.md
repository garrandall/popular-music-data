You told me that others before you
Were foolish to cause me to cry
And just when I learned to adore you
You kissed one more dream goodbye

And left me lonely again
Just like you found me
Lonely again
No arms around me

Just when I'm sure
That my heart is secure
And my tear drops are dry
With a warm glow inside
And this love of mine
Till the end of the line
That's always the time
That I'm lonely again

You told me you wanted me only
That this time and this love would last
You told me I'd never be lonely
And now you belong to the past

And I'm so lonely again
Just like you found me
Lonely again
No arms around me

Just when I'm sure
That my heart is secure
And my tear drops are dry
With a warm glow inside
And this love of mine
Till the end of the line
That's always the time
That I'm lonely again
