Hold on to what we've got
Don't let it go because we've got a lot
Hold on to what we've got
Never give up, don't let this love walk out on you

Sometimes love can bring you down
You just don't know what's wrong from right
It gets tough to turn around
And maybe it's not worth the fight
Well think twice before you throw it away
Just open your heart to what I've got to say

Hold on to what we've got
Don't let it go because we've got a lot
Hold on to what we've got
Never give up, don't let this love walk out on you

When love calls your name
You can't find a place to hide
Your heart falls, you feel the pain
It's tearing you up inside

There's no reason to feel this way
Don't give up on love because it's here to stay

Hold on to what we've got
Don't let it go because we've got a lot
Hold on to what we've got
Never give up, don't let this love walk out on you

If you've got someone who loves you
Someone who understands
Hold on to love

Don't let it slip right through your hands
Everybody needs a lover
Someone to call their own
You know it's worth the fight
So you've got to hold on

Think twice before you throw it away
Just open your heart to what I've got to say
