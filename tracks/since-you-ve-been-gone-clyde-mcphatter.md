Early in the mornin, before the crack on dawn
I'm sitting here thinking, oh why was I born?
I'm so broken hearted, I just can't go on
Since you've been gone (since you've been gone)
Since you've been gone (since you've been gone)

Now I was so happy, with you by my side
You told me you loved me, but a honey you lied
You left me here crying, how can I go on?
Since you've been gone (since you've been gone)
Since you've been gone (since you've been gone)

The night seems like a million years
Waitin' till the break of day appears
All night long weeping like a willow
Tossing and turning on my tear-stained pillow
Guess I'm gonna drown in my own tears
I'm gonnna go walking by the railroad track
I'm just gonna let the ChooChoo, cross over my back
Life ain't worth living, can't go on
Since you've been gone (since you've been gone)
Since you've been gone (since you've been gone)

All night long weeping like a willow
Tossing and turning on my tear-stained pillow
Guess I'm gonna drown in my own tears
I'm gonna go walking by the railroad track
Gonna let the, Choo, Choo, Choo, run over my back
Life ain't worth living, how can I go on?
Since you've been gone (since you've been gone)
Since you've been go-one (since you've been gone)
Since you've been gone (since you've been gone)
Since you've been gone (since you've been gone)
(SINCE YOUVE BEEN GONE)
