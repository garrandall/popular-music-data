Before he takes you from me
When you know I love you true
Darling, ask yourself this question
Does he mean that much to you

Does he mean that much to you
That you'll tear my dreams apart
After all that we've been through
Can you turn me from your heart

Can you watch me walk away
To a life, alone and blue
Oh, my darling, does he
Mean that much to you

Is the day so long without him
That you dream of his embrace
Do you care so much about him
That no one can take his place

I'll step down and set you free, dear
If you say these things are true
That's how much you mean to me, dear
Does he mean that much to you

Does he mean that much to you
That you'll tear my dreams apart
After all that we've been through
Can you turn me from your heart

Can you watch me walk away
To a life, alone and blue
Oh, my darling, does he
Mean that much to you

Oh, my darling, does he
Mean that much to you
