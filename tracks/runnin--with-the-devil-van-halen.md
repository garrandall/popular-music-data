I live my life like there's no tomorrow
All I've got I had to steal
Least I don't need to beg or borrow
Yes, I'm living at a pace that kills

Runnin' with the devil
Runnin' with the devil
Runnin' with the devil

I found the simple life ain't so simple
When I jumped out on that road
I got no love, no love you'd call real
Ain't got nobody waiting at home

Runnin' with the devil
Runnin' with the devil
Runnin' with the devil

I found the simple life, weren't so simple
When I jumped out on that road
I got no love, no love you'd call real
Ain't got nobody waiting at home

Runnin' with the devil
Runnin' with the devil
Runnin' with the devil

Runnin' with the devil
Runnin' with the devil
Runnin' with the devil

Runnin' with the devil
Runnin' with the devil
