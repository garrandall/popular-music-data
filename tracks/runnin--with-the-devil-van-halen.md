Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah


I live my life like there's no tomorrow
And all I've got I had to steal
Least I don't need to beg or borrow
Yes, I'm livin' at a pace that kills
Oh, yeah


(Runnin' with the devil)
Ah, Ah-ha yeah, whoo-hoo-oh
(Runnin' with the devil)
I'll tell y'all about it


I found the simple life ain't so simple
When I jumped out on that road
I got no love, no love you'd call real
Ain't got nobody waitin' at home


Ah, yeah
(Runnin' with the devil)
God damn it lady, you know I ain't lying to ya
I'm only gonna tell you one time
Ah, yeah
(Runnin' with the devil)
Yes I am
Yeah


Whoo
Whoo


You know Iâ€”
I found the simple life, weren't so simple, no
When I jumped out on that road
Got no love, no love you'd call real
Got nobody waiting at home


(Runnin' with the devil)
(Runnin' with the devil)


Woo


(Runnin' with the devil)
(Runnin' with the devil)
