Boss up 
Don't get me crossed up 
We like to drink the sauce up 
Toss money at the bar and floss up 
Boss up 
Y'all know who's the nicest 
I'm from Detroit, player 
I don't care what the price is 

I don't wear Nike Air force ones no more, baby, I'm sorry 
My sneakers cost nine hundred dollars and they made by Maury 
My shit's ridiculous, got gold in my toilet stool 
And bitches wanna swear theres diamonds in my swimmin pool, 
"He's so cool!" 
When the girls see me, they all drool, 
Because they know that I'm the one thats breaking all the rules 
My mink coat's so long, you can mistake it for carpet 
You got purple kush up in that blunt, homie? Just spark it 
If twenty-six's aint on your truck, you should just park it 
Because you're out there like that department store, Target 
I bought the Beatles catelogue back from Michael Jackson 
Then called his ass a child-molester right before I slapped him 
Then sold the shit to Paul Micartney, then I double-taxed him 
The chrome Desert Eagle convinced him - and relaxed him 
Christina Aguilera came over, did me dirty 
I told Beyonce stop trying to give me Jay z's birdy 
I know you purdy, but go get me a ice-cold Pepsi 
Then get your ass in this hot tub with me and Lisa Marie Presley 

Boss up 
Don't get me crossed up 
We like to drink the sauce up 
Toss money at the bar and floss up 
Boss up 
Y'all know who's the nicest 
I'm from Detroit, player 
I don't care what the price is 

I walk on rose petals, my feet never touch the ground 
Got two bitches - one to wipe me up, one to wipe me down 
I sleep with three women all night, it's like a hardcore porn 
They got me shakin in my bed like Ozzy Osbourne 
I got the power 
I'm pissing golden showers 
The hoe that wipe my ass say it smells like flowers 
Is that neccessary? Me and Halle Barry in a bubble bath 
Just got back from Germany, I'm jet lag 

Boss up 
Don't get me crossed up 
We like to drink the sauce up 
Toss money at the bar and floss up 
Boss up 
Y'all know who's the nicest 
I'm from Detroit, player 
I don't care what the price is 

I got four hundred acres in the city on the East side 
Police, they work for me, deliver donuts and pizza 
I pay Mariah Carry to come and sit on my toilet and sing to me 
When I'm in the tub, and dry my booty when I'm done 
I got three helicopters and I rent them out for videos 
So rappers can front and try to boss up like me, I suppose 
I got a pit with platinum slugs and a doghouse, with an escalator in it 
You's a hater, admit it 
I did it, i made it 
You hate it, can't fade it 
Murdered a bitch with my bare hands and only got a fine and paid it 
Bought the jury each a bently, after the trial I took it back 
Here I come! Look at that! Where my fucking hookers at? 
Had a private jet, but I sold it to the Soviets 
As boss as it gets, for real and flossing all hits 
I'm underground, undetected, much respected 
Never rejected, my downfall - dont expect it. 

Boss up 
Don't get me crossed up 
We like to drink the sauce up 
Toss money at the bar and floss up 
Boss up 
Y'all know who's the nicest 
I'm from Detroit, player 
I don't care what the price is
