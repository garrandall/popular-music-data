I don't know what they're talking about
I'm making my own decisions
This thing that I found ain't gonna bring me down
I'm like a junkie without an addiction
Mama, don't cry, I just wanna stay high
I like playing with danger and fear
Everybody's walking, but nobody's talking
It looks a lot better from here


All my life I've been over the top
I don't know what I'm doing, all I know is I don't wanna stop
All fired up I'm gonna go 'till I drop
You're either in or in the way, don't make me, I don't wanna stop


Why don't they ever listen to me?
It's just a one-way conversation
Nothing they say is gonna set me free
Don't need no mental masturbation
Too many religions, but only one God
I don't need another savior
Don't try to change my mind
You know I'm one of a kind
Ain't gonna change my bad behavior


All my life, I've been over the top
I don't know what I'm doing, all I know is I don't wanna stop
All fired up I'm gonna go 'till I drop
You're either in or in the way, don't make me, I don't wanna stop
All my life, I've been over the top
I don't know what I'm doing, all I know is I don't wanna stop
All fired up I'm gonna go 'till I drop
You're either in or in the way, don't make me I don't wanna stop


(???)
I don't wanna stop
I don't wanna stop
(Are you really not going to stop?)
I don't wanna stop
I don't wanna stop
(???)
I don't wanna stop
I don't wanna stop
(Are you really not going to stop?)
I don't wanna stop


All my life, I've been over the top
I don't know what I'm doing, all I know is I don't wanna stop
All fired up I'm gonna go 'till I drop
You're either in or in the way, don't make me I don't wanna stop
All my life, I've been over the top
I don't know what I'm doing, all I know is I don't wanna stop
All fired up I'm gonna go 'till I drop
You're either in or in the way, don't make me I don't wanna stop
