Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
(Oh, no)
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
(I love him so)
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
(Oh, don't you know)
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby

He's good
(He's good)
He's good to me
(Good to me)
And that's all I care about

(Oh, no)
Don't you tell me my baby's just a playboy
(It isn’t true)
Don't you tell me my baby's just a playboy
(That’s a lie)
I won't listen to a single word you say
(He's my guy)
Don't you tell me my baby's just a playboy

He's true
(He's true)
He's true to me
(True to me)
So, girl, you better shut your mouth

(Everybody says he's lazy)
But not when he's kissin' me
(Everybody says he's crazy)
Sure he's crazy
Crazy about me, oh, yeah

Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
(Oh, no)
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
(I love him so)
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
(Oh, don't you know)
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby

He's good
(He's good)
He's good to me
(Good to me)
And that's all I care about

(Oh, no)
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
(Oh, no)
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
(I love him so)
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
(Oh, don't you know)
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby

He's true
(He's true)
He's true to me
(True to me)
So, girl, you better shut your mouth

(Oh, no)
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
(Oh, no)
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby

Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
(Oh, no)
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
(Oh, no)

Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
(Oh, no)
Don't say nothin' bad about my baby
