I-i-i-i-i got struck by lightning and the thunder
Wilder than the shit from the tundra, no wonder
Help me up someone’s pullin’ me under
A scorcher, flame on the brain this is torture
Terrible, horrible sick shit I brought ya
Sacrifice the virgin, urbanized splurging
Split splice oper-fucking-ratin' like a surgeon
Write rhymes that got shot up bullet holes in the paper
Escape the madness, Onyx the baddest yep
Souls of a soldier in the streets of survival
If you’re blinded by the blackness, here’s the gun to guide you
Fumble up crews, crumble up under pressure, god
It’s hard, fuck you broken tooth bitin’


Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey
Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey
Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey
Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey


Come and just bust me feel the real shit
Drilled through your eardrum, hell yeah I’m fearsome
My equilibrium, is touched with the U.S.G., sickness
Contaminated with slickness
Filthy, nasty grungy facts of the wretched
I got it to flex it, crazy desperate to set shit
Yeah son, keep ‘em on the run
If it wasn’t you too, then you musta been the one
It’s not a big case to erase who bass in my face
You’ll just waste ya time and blood so ya better play ya space
Cause if not some shit gonna get real stupid
And you and your man can’t troop it


Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey
Shiftee! Shiftee! Shiftee! Shiftee!


Ay you ya nasty ass! (What’s up big fella?)
Hey whatever whatever shit, the dirty desert dweller
Who said never? All in together
(Now I’ma show you how the Afficial niggas fuck it up)


Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey
Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey
Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey
Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey
Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey
Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey
Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey
Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey


One day I’mma rule the fuckin’ world, just mark my word
I've got the filthiest shit, human ears ever heard!
And even if you wash my mouth out with soap
I’ll still be as disgusting and despicable!
Unpredictable, liable to flip my lid!
My moms dropped me on my head, when I was a kid!
Back then I lost all my marbles, today I lost my job
So unless it’s Armageddon somebody’s bound to get robbed
Watch out! This could be you I believe
With a gun in your face, it’s better to give than receive
I'm more than meets the eye, energize
Make your blood pressure rise. Mad Face ain't no disguise!


Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey
Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey
Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey
Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey


Yeaaaaaaa!
