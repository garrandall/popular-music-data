How come every time we meet?
You got lots of little people
Running 'round at your feet?

You're the center of attention
In the cafes and the bars
Everybody treats you like a superstar

Then again I know who you are
You're taking it too far

Wild nights and parties
In the hills of Hollywood
And all the papers tell me
That you're doing pretty good

They tell me the way
You hang around with the guys
In their leathers and chains
The way you eat your way
Into their little brains

Then again, I know who you are
You've gone a bit too far

You're so la di da
So la di da
Honey you're la di da
You're so la di da

Why don't you listen to me?
La di da
You're so la di da
Oh baby, you're so la di da
So, you're so la di da

(Oh baby)
La di da
La di da
Oh baby, you're so la di da
La di da

(Why do you keep on hurting me?)
La di da
(Baby, baby you're so)
La di da
Why don't you listen to me?
La di da
Honey you're so

I used to think you were mine
And you would tell me
What's going on in your mind
You'd say, "I've got problems
That I don't understand"

"And if you've got the answers
Will you put them in my hand"
I'd say, "You went a bit too far
Do you know what you are?"

La di da
You're so la di da
Honey you're la di da
Baby, you're so la di da

Why do you do it to me?
La di da
Honey, you're so la di da
(Breaking me inside)
La di da
(Breaking all the )
La di da

Wanna be so, wanna be so, wanna be so
Wanna be so  baby
La di da
You're so la di da
Honey you're so la di da
Baby, you're so la di da

Wanna be so, wanna be so, wanna be so
Wanna be so  baby
La di da
You're so la di da
Honey you're so la di da
Baby, you're so la di da
La di da
