I'm calling to tell you its over
Yes darling, you're now free to go.
You're saying you're sorry you hurt me
But you hurt me much more than you know.
You're asking me where this call comes from
Oh, I hope you won't end up here.
If your new romance turns out a failure,
Here's where you'll find me my dear.



I'm just on the blue side of lonesome
Right next to the Heartbreak Hotel
In a tavern that's known as Three Teardrops
On a bar stool, not doing so well.

The floor has a carpet of sorrows,
Yet no one can weep in the aisle.
And they say someone broke the bar mirror,
With only the ghost of a smile.
The hands on the clock never alter,
For things never change in this place.
There's no present, no past, no future,
We're the ones who have lost in loves race.
