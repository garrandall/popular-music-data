You didn't have to love me like you did
But you did, but you did.
And I thank you.
You didn't have to love me like you did
But you did, but you did.
And I thank you.
But you took your love to someone else
I wouldn't know what it meant to be loved to death

You made me feel like I've never felt
Kisses so good I had to holler for help
You didn't have to squeeze it but you did
But you did but you did
And I thank you.
You didn't have to hold it but you did
But you did but you did
And I thank you.

Every day was something new,
You put on your bag and your fine to-do
You got me trying new things too
Just so I can keep up with you.

You didn't have to shake it but you did
But you did but you did
And I thank you.
You didn't have to make it like you did
but you did but you did
And I thank you.

All my life I've been shortchanged
Without your love baby it's a crying shame
But now I know what the fellas talking about
Hear me say that they been turned out
I want to thank you
I want to thank you
I want to thank you
Yes, I want to thank you
