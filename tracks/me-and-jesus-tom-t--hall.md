Well
Me and Jesus got our own thing goin'
Me and Jesus got it all worked out
Me and Jesus got our own thing goin'
We don't need anybody to tell us what it's all about

I know a man who once was a sinner
I know a man that once was a drunk
I know a man, once was a loser
But he went out one day and made an altar out of a stump

Me and Jesus got our own thing goin'
Me and Jesus got it all worked out
Me and Jesus got our own thing goin'
We don't need anybody to tell us what it's all about

Jesus brought me through all o' my troubles
Jesus brought me through all o' my trials
Jesus brought me through all o' my heartaches
And I know that Jesus ain't gonna forsake me now

Me and Jesus got our own thing goin'
Me and Jesus got it all worked out
Me and Jesus got our own thing goin'
We don't need anybody to tell us what it's all about

We can't afford any fancy preachin'
We can't afford any fancy church
We can't afford any fancy singin'
But you know Jesus got a lot of poor people out doin' his work

Me and Jesus got our own thing goin'
Me and Jesus got it all worked out
Me and Jesus got our own thing goin'
We don't need anybody to tell us what it's all about

Me and Jesus got our own thing goin'
Me and Jesus got it all worked out
Me and Jesus
