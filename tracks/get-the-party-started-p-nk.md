(It can't be)
Uh...uh it's time to get the party started
Yeah, it's time to get the party started (Yeah, Killer)
Yeah, Rockwilder, Redman, and Pink (It can't be)


Yo, Funk Doc walk into the club actin' rowdy
I'm houndin' for the right girl to crown me
Fuck a little bit up, lift ya shirt a bit up
Get the gentlemen off, turn the temperature up
One blink turn the world around
Just one drink make ya hurl it down 
Who that there, we up here
You better like move back there if you that scared
Doctor, Pink let's happen to link
I'm in the tuck bleedin' to death, harassin' the freak
(AHH!) I'm back in the beat, happen to be ROCK!!!
Introducing, beat the underground make it shake upstairs
Women throw that shit till they make-up smears
Hit it, in my cup let's fire it up
Are you high or what


Get the party started on a Saturday night
Everybody's waitin' for me to arrive
Sendin' out the message to all of my friends
We'll be lookin' flashy in my Mercedes Benz
I got lots of style, got my gold diamond rings
I can go for miles if you know what I mean, oh


I'm comin' up
So you better you better get this party started
I'm comin' up
So you better you better get this party started


Pumpin' up the volume, breakin' down to the beat
Cruisin' through the Westside
We'll be checkin' the scene
Boulevard is freakin' as I'm comin' up fast
I'll be burnin' rubber, you'll be kissin' my ass
Pull up to the bumper, get out of the car
License plate says "Stunner #1 Superstar"




Sweet dreams are made of these
Who am I to disagree
Traveled the world and the Seven Seas
Everybody get the party started
Sweet dreams are made of these
Who am I to disagree
Traveled the world and the Seven Seas
Everybody...(Yeah, everybody lookin' lookin' lookin')


Yo, yo, yo everybody move, everybody jump
Everybody stomp the floor, get it crunk
Everybody move, everybody jump
Everybody stomp the floor
It's Rockwilder, rock the house
Yo Pink diggy, rock the house
Yo Funk Doc, rock the house
Yo scream at cha' boy real loud girl


Get the party started ooh
Get this party started, right now
Get this party started
I'm comin' up (Yeah)
I'm comin' up (Ladies and gentlemen)
(Another Rockwilder production)
I'm comin' up (Ha, ha, ha)
I'm comin' up, I'm comin' up
I'm comin' up, gonna get the party started
(Lookin' lookin' lookin' lookin')
Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to be abused
We just want to.....
