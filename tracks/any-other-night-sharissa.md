Any other night, you woulda been somewhere with your freinds
Any other night, you'd a had things to do (oh
Any other night, I woulda been home alone, in my bed
Any other night, I would wanna see you


Boy you picked the wrong time, cause I got company
Boy you picked the wrong time, yeah I got anotha n*gga layin up wit me
Boy you picked the wrong time, and it coulda been you but your too busy
Boy you picked the wrong time, whats a woman to do when shes feelin lonley


Any other night, I'd a had to page you more than once
Any other night, I'd a been waitin for your call (yeah)
Any other night your too damn busy, for me
And any other night, it woulda been good but not tonight


Boy you picked the wrong time, cause I got company
Boy you picked the wrong time, and it woulda been you with me
Boy you picked the wrong time, layin in my bed, in my bed, in my bed
Boy you picked the wrong time, but whats a shorty to do when shes feelin lonely


Dont be surprised boy, you shoulda known that I,
would not just keep on chaseing you around, I called you cause I wanted to
see you but you said, you were too busy, so I found someone else


Boy you picked the wrong time, boy you picked a fine time, to show up
Boy you picked the wrong time, did you get my 2-way, you didnt answer your phone at home
Boy you picked the wrong time, noooo, yeah..
Boy you picked the wrong time, whats a girl to do..


(Boy you picked the wrong time)
Any other night, it woulda been coo to chill wit Ree
(Boy you picked the wrong time)
And Any other night, you coulda been makin love to me
(Boy you picked the wrong time) But not tonight, its his night, its his night
(Boy you picked the wrong time)
And any other night, woulda been your night

Boy you picked the wrong time..
Boy you picked the wrong time..
Boy you picked the wrong time...
