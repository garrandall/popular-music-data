So I found myself in the sun, oh yeah
A hell of a place to end a run, oh yeah


California, I'm fine
Somebody check my brain
California's all right
Somebody check my brain
Check my brain


I walk these streets, I creep and I fall, oh yeah
When she sang I answered the call, oh yeah


California, I'm fine
Somebody check my brain
California's all right
Somebody check my brain
Ah, tears have filled my bones
Ah, years expended gone


I hung my guns and put em away, oh yeah
The trick of the trade, and by the way, oh yeah


California, I'm fine
Somebody check my brain
California's all right
Somebody check my brain
Ah, tears have filled my bones
Ah, years expended gone


Ah, tears have filled my bones
Ah, years expended gone
Ah, tears have filled my bones
Ah, years expended gone
Check my brain
Check my brain
Check my brain
