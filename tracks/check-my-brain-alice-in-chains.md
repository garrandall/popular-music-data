So I found myself in the sun, oh yeah
A hell of a place to end a run, oh yeah

California's alright
Somebody check my brain
California's alright
Somebody check my brain
Check my brain

I walk these streets, I creep and I fall, oh yeah
When she sang I answered the call, oh yeah

California's alright
Somebody check my brain
California's alright
Somebody check my brain

Tears have filled my bones
Years expended gone

I hung my guns and put them away, oh yeah
The trick of the trade and by the way, oh yeah

California's alright
Somebody check my brain
California's alright
Somebody check my brain

California's alright
Somebody check my brain
California's alright
Somebody check my brain
Check my brain, check my brain
