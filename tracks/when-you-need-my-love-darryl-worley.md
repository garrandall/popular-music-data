Two in the morning telephone rings
Somehow I knew who it was
'Cause baby it's always the same old thing
When you need my love

You say it's over again and again
This time you've had enough
Girl I know you've been fighting with him
When you need my love

Oh I wish I could just say no
And get you out of my heart
It must be nice to have some place to go
When your world falls apart

He'll call tomorrow with the same ol' line
And you'll forget about us
I'll be lonely until the next time
When you need my love

Oh I wish I could just say no
And get you out of my heart
It must be nice to have some place to go
When your world falls apart

Now someday someone's gonna love me true
And baby when she does
Then I wonder what you're gonna do
When you need my love

Yeah, then I wonder what you're gonna do
When you need my love
When you need my love
When you need my love
What are you gonna do
