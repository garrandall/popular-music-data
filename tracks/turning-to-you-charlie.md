Thomas

Been down on my luck, things ain't been going so well, I've tried
Tried very hard to pull through
You know how it goes, you win some, you lose some too, but I've
Been losing so long, don't know what to do
So help me please, I'm turning to you
I'm on my knees and I'm turning to you
You got what I need, I'm turning to you
Oh, don't let me down
Time after time I've thought about what you said when I
Told you my plans and my dreams
So now it's gone wrong, the dreams are all nightmares now and so
I'm turning to you just one more time
So help me please, I'm turning to you
I'm on my knees and I'm turning to you
You got what I need, I'm turning to you
Oh, don't let me down
