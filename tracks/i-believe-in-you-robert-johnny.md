Oo woah woah oo woah woah
Oo woah woah oo woah woah
I believe in you
Yes, yes I really do
I, I love you
Yes I do
Woah woah oo woah woah oo woah woah
Baby, you are my fill
Woah woah
You send those cold chills
Up and down my spine

Don't tell me (don't tell me)
Don't tell me (don't you tell me)
What my baby's done (what she's done)
For I don't believe you (I won't believe you)
For I believe in her
Oo woah woah oo woah woah oo woah woah
Oo woah woah oo woah woah oo
I believe in her

I believe in you
Yes, yes I really do
I, I love you
Yes I do
Woah woah oo woah woah oo
I believe in you
Woah woah oo
I believe in you
Woah woah oo
