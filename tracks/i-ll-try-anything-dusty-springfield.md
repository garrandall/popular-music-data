You belong
To somebody else and not to me
Right or wrong
That's not the way that it's gonna be
I want you so much inside
I'm throwin' away all my conscience and pride, and

I'll try anything to get you
I'll do anything I can
I'll try anything to get you
I'll cheat and I'll lie
And I'll try 'til I die
'Til I make you my man
Gonna make you my man

I've been burned
Whenever I've followed all the rules
So I've learned
That playing it fair is just for fools
I'm fighting and win or lose
I'm not minding my P's and Q's, and

I'll try anything to get you
I'll do anything I can
I'll try anything to get you
I'll cheat and I'll lie
Try 'til I die
'Til I make you my man
My man, hey, oh oohohohhoh

I want you so much inside
I'm throwin' away all my conscience and pride, and

I'll try anything to get you
I'll do anything I can
I'll try anything to get you
I'll cheat and I'll lie
Try 'til I die
'Til I make you my man
Gonna make you my man
Gonna make you my man, yeah
Make you my man
Gonna fight 'til I die
Gonna cheat and lie
