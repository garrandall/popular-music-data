Come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
Now let's do that song for Peep
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town
So come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down, yeah


Come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
So come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh


Rain keeps falling, tears keep falling
Rain keeps falling, tears keep falling
Darlin’, your love is like walking in a bed of nails
And I just can't keep on fighting


Come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around, yeah
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
So come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh


His name will live, brother
Bro, I got-, I feel hella shitty because it's like, yo
Like, if I would have known he was so cool
And it's like, yo, if I would have watched interviews sooner
Bro, we were so alike
It's unfortunate because it's like, yo, when people die
That's when we like 'em, you know?
'Cause your remorse kinda makes you check 'em out


Darling, your love is like walking in a bed of nails
And I just can't keep on fightin’
Oh-oh-oh


Come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around, yeah
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
So come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
