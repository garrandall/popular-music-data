Aye, Jim, you know the ol' sugar daddies?
They be trickin', they tell them girls
I said you could have whatever you like (If you like)
I said you could have whatever you like (If you like)
Yeah (Yeah)


Stacks on deck, Patron on ice
And we can pop bottles all night
And, baby, you could have whatever you like (If you like)
I said you could have whatever you like, yeah
Late night sex, so wet and so tight
I gas up the jet for you tonight
And, baby, you could go wherever you like (If you like)
I said you could go wherever you like, yeah (Yeah)


Anytime you want to pick up the telephone, you
Know it ain't nothin' to drop a couple stacks on you
Want it, you could get it, my dear
Five million dollar home, drop Bentleys, I swear, yeah


I want yo' body, need yo' body
Long as you got me you won't need nobody
You want it, I got it, go get it, I'll buy it
Tell them other broke nigga be quiet


Stacks on deck, Patron on ice
And we can pop bottles all night
And, baby, you could have whatever you like (If you like)
I said you could have whatever you like, yeah
Late night sex, so wet and so tight
I gas up the jet for you tonight
And, baby, you could go wherever you like (If you like)
I said you could go wherever you like, yeah (Yeah)


Shawty, you the hottest, love the way you drop it
So good I swore you went to college
Hundred karat deposit, to vacations in the tropics
â€˜Cause e'rybody know it ain't trickin' if you got it
You need never ever gotta go to yo' wallet
Long as I got rubberband banks in my pocket
Five, six rides with rims and a body kit
You ain't gotta downgrade, you can get what I get
My chick could have what she want
And go in any store for any bag she want
And, no, she ain't never had a man like that
To buy you anything your heart desire like that, yeah


I want yo' body, need yo' body
Long as you got me you won't need nobody
You want it, I got it, go get it, I'll buy it
Tell them other broke nigga be quiet


Stacks on deck, Patron on ice
And we can pop bottles all night
And, baby, you could have whatever you like (If you like)
I said you could have whatever you like, yeah
Late night sex, so wet and so tight
I gas up the jet for you tonight
And, baby, you could go wherever you like (If you like)
I said you could go wherever you like, yeah (Yeah)


I'm talkin' big boy rides, and big boy ice
Let me put this big boy in yo' life
You just be so fresh, and look so nice
Let me put this big boy in yo' life; that's right


I want yo' body, need yo' body
Long as you got me you won't need nobody
You want it, I got it, go get it, I'll buy it
Tell them other broke nigga be quiet


Stacks on deck, Patron on ice
And we can pop bottles all night
And, baby, you could have whatever you like (If you like)
I said you could have whatever you like, yeah
Late night sex, so wet and so tight
I gas up the jet for you tonight
And, baby, you could go wherever you like (If you like)
I said you could go wherever you like, yeah (Yeah)
