I believe In you and me
I believe that we will be
In love eternally
Well as far as I can see
You will always be the one
For me
Oh yes, you will


I believe in dreams again
I believe that love will never end
And like the river finds the sea
I was lost, now I'm free
'Cause I believe In you and me


I will never leave your side
I will never hurt your pride
When all the chips are down
I will always be around
Just to be right where you are
My love, oh, you know I love you, boy
I will never leave you out
I will always let you in
To places no-one's ever been
Deep inside, can't you see?
That I believe in you and me


Well, maybe I'm a fool
To feel the way I do
But I will play the fool forever
Just to be with you forever


I believe in miracles
And love is the miracle
And yes, baby you're my dream come true
I was lost, now I'm free
Oh, darling
I believe in you and me
See, I was lost, now I'm free
'Cause I believe in you and me
