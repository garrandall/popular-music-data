(Just you, just me, always together)


I have made up my mind years ago
When I first gazed upon you, I'd never let you go
And it's amazing baby (How we loved each other so)


And we'll always be (Always be)
Always together


We'll have our problems
But we'll face them with pride
Our love, our love is protection
And we don't have to hide
And a thousand nights I'll kiss away (The happy tears you'll cry)


And we'll always be (always be)
Always together
Just you, just me
Always (Together), always (Together), always (Together)
Always (Together), always (Together)


When the years have turned your hair to silver
And the days of our youth
Have left us so very far behind
Golden, golden memories
Will keep in our minds


And we'll always be (Always be)
Always together
Just you, just me
Always (Together), always (Together), always (Together)
Always (Together), always (Together), always now (Together)


Always
