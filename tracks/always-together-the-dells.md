I say forever
You told me never
We'd be together
You run away from me
No matter the weather
I'll be your shelter
Life would be better
If you just stay with me

I can't just give in
My heart, yes it's hidden
I'm still forgiving
So I run away from you
But please don't stop chasing
Boy, just be patient
Your time won't be wasted
If you just stay with me

You push (I hide) away (my heart) my love
Over and over
I tried (you tried) to make (but I) you stay
Can't get no closer
I won't (you won't) give up (give up) on us
So can we just give it a try?
I know it won't be easy

But you choose
It's up to you
What we gonna do
Got nothing to lose
Choose
It's up to you
What we gonna do
You and me
We got nothing to lose

Been almost forever
I said that never
Do you remember
You said you'll wait for me
I said I'd love you, no lie
I knew you'd let me in time
It's good to pass no deadline
I'll always wait for you

You push (I hide) away (my heart) my love
Over and over
I try (you try) to make (but I) you stay
Can't get no closer
I won't (you won't) give up (give up) on us
So can we just give it a try?
I know it won't be easy

But you choose
It's up to you
What we gonna do
Got nothing to lose
Choose (choose)
It's up to you (it's up to you)
What we gonna do
You and me
We got nothing to lose
It's up to
What we gonna do
Got nothing to lose
Choose (choose)
It's up to you (you)
What we gonna do
You and me
We got nothing to lose

I say forever
I'll leave you never
Life is much better
Just stay with me
