I took my baby to a party last night
Uh Huh Hah
She was so beautiful she made me uptight
Uh Huh Hah
Up come a butcher with her ju jus alright
Uh Huh Hah
It's all da da down to Goodnight Vienna!

Felt like a bohunk but I kept up my cool
Uh Huh Hah
Green as a frog, man I was back into school
Uh Huh Hah
Zipped up my mouth coz I was starting to droll
Uh Huh Hah
It's all da da down to Goodnight Vienna!


Get it up (Keep it up), get it up (keep it up)
Get it up (Keep it up), get it up (keep it up)
It's all da da down to Goodnight Vienna!

She said she loved me but I knew she was lying
Uh Huh Hah
Felt like an Arab who was dancing through Zion
Uh Huh Hah
Don't call no doctor when ya just feel like crying
Uh Huh Hah
It's all da da down to Goodnight Vienna!


Get it up (Keep it up), get it up (keep it up)
Get it up (Keep it up), get it up (keep it up)
It's all da da down to Goodnight Vienna!
