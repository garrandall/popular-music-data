Honey you do me wrong but still I'm crazy about you
Stay away too long and I can't do without you
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before
I know flowers go through rain
But how can love go through pain


Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-ality
Ain't that peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be


You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
I've been so much in love with you baby 'till I don't wanna see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all
Your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger (stronger, stronger, stronger)


Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-ality
Ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar-arity, hey, hey


I cried so much just like a child that's lost its toy
Maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears (tears, tears, tears)

Now ain't that peculiar baby?
Peculiar-arity
Ain't it peculiar, honey?
Peculiar as can be

Said I don't understand it baby
It's so strange sometimes
Ain't it peculiar, darling?
