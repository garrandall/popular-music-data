She got the brown eyes, caramel thighs
Long  hair, no wedding ring, hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way
And now I really wanna know your name
She got the, mm, white dress, but when she's wearin' less
Man, you know that she drives me crazy
The brown eyes, beautiful smile
You know I love watching you do your thing

I love her hips, curves, lips say the words
"Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
I kiss her, this love is like a dream
So join me in this bed that I'm in
And  push up on me and sweat, darling

So I'm gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me

She got that, mm, green eyes, givin' me signs
That she really wants to know my name, hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way
And suddenly, I'm glad I came, ay!
Ven para acá quiero bailar, toma mi mano
Quiero sentir tu cuerpo en mi, estás temblando
Mm, green eyes, takin' your time
Now we know we'll never be the same

I love her lips 'cause she says the words
"Te amo, papi, ah, te amo, papi"
Don't wake up, this love is like a dream

So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat, darling
So I'm gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me

Flawless diamonds
In a green field near Buenos Aires
Until the sun's rising
We won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me

Yo
You never live 'til you risk your life (your life)
You wanna shine, you gotta get more ice (more ice)
Am I your lover or I'm just your vice? (skktt skktt)
A little crazy, but I'm just your type (ey)
You want the lips and the curves, need the whips and the furs
And the diamonds I prefer, and my closet his and hers, ayy
I want the lil' mamacita, margarita (margarita)
I’m with the Ed, Cardi B and Camila ey!
I’m just gonna say what I want
Cause whatever people say
I don’t really give a fuck, bitch
Let’s just spread some love
Yeah that’s what everyone wants
Kiss me like you need me, rub me like a genie
Pull up to my spot in Lamborghini
'Cause you gotta see me, never leave me
You got a boy that could finally do it all
I’ll do everything I can, I’ll tour you all around the world

So join me in this bed that I'm in (oh oh oh)
Push up on me and sweat, darling (oh oh oh oh oh)
So I'm gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)

Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Come south of the border, border
Come south of the border with me
Come south of the border, border
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
