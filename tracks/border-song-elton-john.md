Holy Moses, I have been removed
I have seen the spectre, he was been here too
Distant cousin from down the line
Brand of people who ain't my kind
Holy Moses, I have been removed

Holy Moses, I have been deceived
Now the wind has changed direction
I think I'll have to leave
Won't you please excuse my frankness
But it's not my cup of tea
Holy Moses, I have been deceived, yes, I have

I'm going back to the border
Where my affairs, my affairs ain't been abused
I can't take any more bad water
I've been poisoned from my head down to my shoes
Yes, I have

Holy Moses, I have been removed

Holy Moses, can we live in peace
Let us try to find a way to make all hatred cease
There's a man standing over there
What's his color do you care
Holy Moses, can we live in peace

Holy Moses, can we live in peace
Holy Moses, can we live in
I wonder can we live in peace
