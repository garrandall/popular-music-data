I've been made blue
I've been lied to
When will I be loved

I've been turned down
I've been pushed 'round
When will I be loved

When I meet a new girl that I want for mine
She always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time

I've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved

When I meet a new girl that I want for mine
She always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time

I've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved
When will I be loved
When will I be loved
