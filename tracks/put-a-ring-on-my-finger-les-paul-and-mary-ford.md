Just put a ring on my finger
A kiss on my cheek
And you can bet your life
I'll marry you in the best side of the week
Just say you love me
Be faithful and true
And there's nothing in this great big world
I wouldn't do for you
Now some folks are so bashful
When it comes to making love
Some folks must too forward
And others need a shove
I studied love most carefully
And this way you can't miss
Offer me all your love
A ring and a kiss
Just put a ring on my finger
A kiss on my cheek
And you can bet your life
I'll marry you in the best side of the week
