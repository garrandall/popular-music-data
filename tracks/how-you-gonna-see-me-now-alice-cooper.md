Dear darlin', surprised to hear from me?
Bet you're sittin' drinkin' coffee, yawnin' sleepily

Just to let you know
I'm gonna be home soon
I'm kinda awkward and afraid
Time has changed your point of view

How you gonna see me now?
Please don't see me ugly babe
'Cause I know I let you down
In oh so many ways

How you gonna see me now?
Since we've been on our own
Are you gonna love the man
When the man gets home

Listen darlin', now I'm heading for the west
Straightened out my head but my old heart is still a mess

Yes, I'm worried honey
Guess that's natural though
It's like I'm waiting for a welcome sign
Like a hobo in the snow

How you gonna see me now?
Please don't see me ugly babe
'Cause I know I let you down
In oh so many ways

How you gonna see me now?
Since we've been on our own
Are you gonna love the man
When the man gets home

And just like the first time
We're just strangers again
I might have grown out of style
In the place I've been

And just like the first time
I'll be shakin' inside
When I walk in the door
There'll be no place to hide

How you gonna see me now?
Please don't see me ugly babe
'Cause I know I let you down
In oh so many ways

How you gonna see me now?
Since we've been on our own
Are you gonna love the man
When the man gets home
