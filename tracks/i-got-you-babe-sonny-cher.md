And now, because you've all been so sweet, another duet for you.

They say we're young and we don't know
We won't find out until we grow
Well, I don't know, I guess it's true
'Cause you got me, and baby I got you

Babe
I got you babe
I got you babe

They say our love won't pay the rent
Before it's earned, our money's always spent
Well, I don't know, we got no plot
Still I'm sure of all the love we got

Babe
I got you babe
I got you babe

I got flowers in the spring
I got you to wear my ring
When I'm sad, you're a clown
When I get scared, you're always 'round

Some people say your hair's too long
I don't care, with you I can't go wrong
So put your little hand in mine
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb

Babe
I got you babe
I got you babe
I got you babe
I got you babe

Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you. How wonderful you are. God bless you all.
Oh, you're a lovely crowd. Thank you, guys. Thank you.
