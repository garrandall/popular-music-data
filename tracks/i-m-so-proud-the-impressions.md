Live and love
Crash and burn
Smoke a spliff,
Take some painkillers
Try to get your mind right
Think about it, light another take your time
And when itâs light out
I just stay inside and make a rhyme
Recite in front of the mirror
Iâm staring at my reflection
Iâm searching for a suggestion
Screaming at all of the girls
That never gave me attention
Ironic now that Iâm paid
Bitches pay me attention
Iâm making my teachers proud
Drinking Iâm underaged
Those teachers were two-faced
So now Iâm teaching the lesson
Jeans sagginâ, they say that first impressions
Last the longest
Well to be honest, man
We living for the moment
Thatâs that Grey Goose that Dom P, patron and
We prolly wonât recall this
Recall this in the morning
But fuck it though,
My bucket list consists of getting money, fucking hoes
A young kid with a ton of goals, a misfit

Thatâs why my jeans so tight
Sometimes I do wrong, but I mean so right
Iâm always chilling with the wrong crowd
Iâm always hanging with the wrong crowd

I can never be what I need to be
So I donât really care what they think of me
Iâm always chilling with the wrong crowd
Iâm always hanging with the wrong crowd

Uhh, you see my crewâs a lot of savages
A lot of rude
A lot of crude
A lot of flat out bad kids
Who donât give a fuck about the aftermath of their actions
In the cut
Blowing kisses out the aston, laughing
Man these jeans cost a lot
Fourth quarter, tied game

You know he forced the shot cuz
I canât trust these niggas with my destiny
Especially, cuz I know im destined for better things
Grab some friends
Her, her, baby not you
Migration season Iâm the one they flock to
Foul play, got a nigga on the look out
So I keep one eyebrow raised just like the Rock do
Can you smell me dog?
Smell this kush man
It smelling hella strong
Quiet kids smoking loud
With some nudyâs on
You prolly couldnât fuck with what Iâm smoking on
What Iâm smoking on

Couple motherfuckers that I call my friends
A couple young ladies that Iâll never call again
Iâm always chilling with the wrong crowd
Iâm always hanging with the wrong crowd

Days go fast and the nights move slow
Even before music I was living on the road
Iâm always chilling with the wrong crowd
Iâm always hanging with the wrong crowd
