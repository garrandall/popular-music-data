I'mma do it, do it
Like I wanna do it
You gon' know me like, you ain't never known me before
I'mma bring it, bring it
I'mma give it, give it
You gon' love me like you ain't loved nobody before
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
You gon' love me like you ain't loved nobody before

Too nice, too clean
Too white, too green
Little haters, big dreams
I don't care what you think about me, uh
Two-faced old friends told me the end was near, ha. Forget them
See a lot of things changed since then
Don't they know that I came from Nebraska
Am I gonna quit? Nice of you to ask,
But momma told me go and chase what you after
I'm on track, so I'm gonna rap faster

I'mma break it down for you and get a little deeper
Slayin' on it, prayin' on it like a grim reaper
Running on thermometer, yep, I got a fever
Hi, Konnichiwa, are you a believer?

I'mma do it, do it
Like I wanna do it
You gon' know me like, you ain't never known me before
I'mma bring it, bring it
I'mma give it, give it
You gon' love me like you ain't loved nobody before
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
You gon' love me like you ain't loved nobody before

Too hard, too soft,
Too rough, too posh
Lemme do, what I want
Lace it up, baby tie it in a knot, uh
Race track, two legs, Hollywood, big break
Suck it up, intake
Let me tell ya how it happened real quick oh
Touchdown in the middle of the city
Mass Ave. street, jam up to Newbury
Million dollar party
Now tell me who you wearing
Lots of new hand held hype you can carry

I'mma break it down for you and get a lil' deeper
Slayin' on it, prayin' on it like a grim reaper
Running on thermometer, yep, I got a fever
Hi, Konnichiwa, very nice to meet ya

I'mma do it, do it
Like I wanna do it
You gon' know me like, you ain't never known me before
I'mma bring it, bring it
I'mma give it, give it
You gon' love me like you ain't loved nobody before
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
(Can you hear me now?)
Hello, hello, hello, hello
You gon' love me like you ain't loved nobody before

Let me keep going, baby, 'til I'm dead and gone
That's my only wish, oh
And if you don't know I'll be singing my song
I got a lot to give, oh

I'mma do it, do it
Like I wanna do it
You gon' know me like, you ain't never known me before
I'mma bring it, bring it
I'mma give it, give it
You gon' love me like you ain't loved nobody before
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
(Can you hear me right now?)
Hello, hello, hello, hello
You gon' love me like you ain't loved nobody before

Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
You gon' love me like you ain't loved nobody before
