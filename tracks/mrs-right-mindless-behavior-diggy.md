Where is Mrs. Right?
I gotta find her, her

Streamline and Conjunction

Where is Mrs. Right? I gotta see her
Travel all across the world just to meet her
Get me on a flight. I gotta see her
Travel all across the world just to meet her

Travel to LA
And maybe to the Bay
From the Chi-Town,
But she might be out the States
Book a flight to London,
Book a flight to France
Can we go to Switzerland?
Can we hit Japan?

Shorty say you don't but I bet you do
MB on your ring tone, posters in your room
Sassy little thing. Like-like the way you talk
Heard you got the goods gon' 'head show them off

Take a picture quick, send it to my phone
Dimple in your cheek, white Gucci stunners on
Don't know where you've been hiding from me so long
Prodigy, Roc, RayRay and Princeton. We're on
So, baby, come on

Where is Mrs. Right? I gotta see her
Travel all across the world just to meet her
Get me on a flight. I gotta see her
Travel all across the world just to meet her

Travel to LA
And maybe to the Bay
From the Chi-Town,
But she might be out the States
Book a flight to London,
Book a flight to France
Can we go to Switzerland?
Can we hit Japan?


Light-skinned-ed, dark dark-skinned-ed
Long hair. Don't care long as your heart's in it
Looking for my Mrs. Enough to drive me insane
Matter of fact aye yo Prodigy sing

Hopping on a plane, coming straight to y'all
In Tokyo we say, "Kon'nichiwa." It's off the wall
London in the spring. Pa-Paris in the fall
We don't discriminate girls. No. We love 'em all

All my German chicks, let me kiss you back
Open up your MacBook, put me on your lap
Stay sending me smiley faces on the chat
Met some good girls. Yeah. They're all over the map
But where she at? Where she at?

Where is Mrs. Right? I gotta see her
Travel all across the world just to meet her
Get me on a flight. I gotta see her
Travel all across the world just to meet her

Travel to LA
And maybe to the Bay
From the Chi-Town,
But she might be out the States
Book a flight to London,
Book a flight to France
Can we go to Switzerland?
Can we hit Japan?

Flying so high, so high.
Destination everywhere
I gotta find a way to get to where
You are, you are


Where's my Mrs. Right now?
I need her right now
I got some things I wanna say.
So I'm gonna write it down

Wipe me down, wipe me down,
If I like you, you wifey now
I predict one day we'll be together.
I'm a psychic ow

Been to the south, been to the Bay
Even took a few trips out of the States
I know you an angel,
So maybe I should look outer space

Aye D-I-Double G-Y searching for the right one
Prodigy, Double R, Princeton, Ray Ray,
Let 'em know where we coming from

Where is Mrs. Right? I gotta see her
Travel all across the world just to meet her
Get me on a flight. I gotta see her
Travel all across the world just to meet her

Travel to LA
And maybe to the Bay
From the Chi-Town,
But she might be out the States
Book a flight to London,
Book a flight to France
Can we go to Switzerland?
Can we hit Japan?

Where is Mrs. Right?
