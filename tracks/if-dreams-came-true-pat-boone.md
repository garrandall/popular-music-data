Oh my darling, oh my lover

If dreams came true, dear
I'd dream you everything
That you would always
Be happy as a king

If dreams came true, dear
No trouble would you see
Just song and laughter
To keep you company

Oh my darling, oh my lover
In your heart you would soon discover
Song and laughter ever after
From the dreaming I'd do
If dreams came true

If dreams came true, dear
I'd dream you paradise
A moonlit garden
And stars to match your eyes

But as for me, dear
My world is all agleam
For I have you, dear
And have no need to dream

Oh my darling, oh my lover
In your arms is where I discover
More than moonlight, more than starlight
More than dreaming could do
If dreams came true
