Before all of this ever went down
In another place, another town


You were just a face in the crowd
You were just a face in the crowd
Out in the street, walking around
A face in the crowd


Out of a dream, out of the sky
Into my heart, into my life


And you were just a face in the crowd
You were just a face in the crowd
Out in the street, thinking out loud
A face in the crowd


Out of a dream, out of the sky
Into my heart, into my life


And you were just a face in the crowd
You were just a face in the crowd
Out in the street, walking around
A face in the crowd


A face in the crowd
A face in the crowd
A face in the crowd
