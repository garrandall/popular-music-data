I heard that you're gonna leave me
And there are rumours, baby, yeah
It's another girl, yeah
I worked my fingers
Down to the bone, yeah
To try to make you
A happy home, yeah
So now you're leaving me
This is the thanks I get, baby
This is the thanks I get
This is the thanks I get, baby
I worked my fingers, baby
Worked 'em down down to the bone, yeah
To try to make you a happy home
Babe, baby, babe
I feel so sad, yeah
Makes me feel so bad
I wanna turn my head, baby
Look up to people
But I'm so ashamed, uh huh
So doggone shamed, yeah
You know I'm ashamed, baby
So doggone shamed, yeah
But this is the thanks I get, yeah
This is the thanks I get, baby
This is the thanks I get
Yeah, yeah, yeah....
Wonderful thanks, yeah
