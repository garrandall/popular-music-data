How can it be permissible?
She compromise my principle, yeah, yeah
That kind of love is mythical
She's anything but typical

She's a craze, you'd endorse, she's a powerful force
You're obliged to conform when there's no other course
She used to look good to me, but now I find her

Simply irresistible
Simply irresistible

Her loving is so powerful
It's simply unavoidable
The trend is irreversible
The woman is invincible

She's a natural law and she leaves me in awe
She deserves the applause, I surrender because
She used to look good to me, but now I find her

Simply irresistible
Simply irresistible

Simply irresistible she's so fine, there's no tellin' where the money went
Simply irresistible she's all mine, there's no other way to go

She's unavoidable, I'm backed against the wall
She gives me feelings like I never felt before
I'm breaking promises, she's breaking every law
She used to look good to me, but now I find her

Simply irresistible
She's so fine, there's no tellin' where the money went
Simply irresistible, she's all mine
There's no other way to go

Her methods are inscrutable
The proof is irrefutable
She's so completely kissable
Our lives are indivisible

She's a natural law and she leaves me in awe
She deserves the applause, I surrender because
She used to look good to me, but now I find her

Simply irresistible
Simply irresistible
Simply irresistible
Simply irresistible
Simply irresistible
