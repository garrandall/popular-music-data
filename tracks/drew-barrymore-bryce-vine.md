I want this forever
Just you in the grotto
Nothin' but your nights on
Keep the fuckin' lights on
Same again tomorrow
We don't need no bottle
Purple-colored lipgloss
Room at The Saguaro
Ain't nowhere I would rather be
Right between your holidays
Coffee on the flintstone
Jewelry on the ottoman
Baby, let me in
For I get way too adamant about it
Love the way you shiver
Dig into my shoulder blades
Feel it when you quiver
Higher level, elevate
You could be the renegade
Bonnie to a Clyde
Harrelson and Juliet
Legends never die
The TV hasn't worked in ages
Probably got a shorted cable
Way too busy fucking on the sofa or the kitchen table
Is my vision hazy?
You look like you're someone famous

'Cause you're the next Drew Barry
And I want more, yeah
And all these other girls keep wonderin' what I fuck with you for
'Cause you're the next Drew Barry, yeah
And I want more (I want more, more)
And all these other girls keep wonderin' what I fuck with you for (what I fuck with you for)


Dear Mrs. Barry
More than the record
Lord, are you married?
Do that scare you, is you ready?
You doin' somethin' to me
These rappers I devour
You send 'em my direction and it's Santa Clara Diet
I am not afraid of no one
You smoke that poison ivy
Girl, I whip it, go the distance
Then I kiss it 'cause they have it
50 First Dates (uh), hit it then skate (oh
Get it with a real one, why you always fakin'?
I don't got no patience
I don't got no shame, man
I don't play no games
'Cause if I like you, I'ma say that
Aggressive and I'm playful
That's a perfect balance though
I'm from where that Solbiato choppers and New Balance go
This is my Landover flow
Killin', had them rollers though
I would buy me everything with credit card from MoCO hoes
Dear Mrs. Barry
No, I mean Halle
Tell me now I'm coming cool 'cause Boomerang was poppin'


'Cause you're the next Drew Barry
And I want more (and I want more, more)
And all these other girls keep wonderin' what I fuck with you for (what I fuck with you for)
'Cause you're the next Drew Barry, yeah (next Drew Barry)
And I want more (I want more, more, more)
And all these other girls keep wonderin' what I fuck with you for (what I fuck with you for)

I wanna make
Every single moment for you great
Fly away to Cairo or L.A
Girl, I want it now
Don't wanna waste time, waste time
I wanna make
Every single moment for you great, yeah
Fly away to Cairo or L.A
Girl, I want it now
Don't wanna waste time

'Cause you're the next Drew Barry
And I want more, yeah (more more)
And all these other girls keep wonderin' what I fuck with you for (what I fuck with you for)
You're the next Drew Barry, yeah
And I want more (and I want more, more)
And all these other girls keep wonderin' what I fuck with you for
