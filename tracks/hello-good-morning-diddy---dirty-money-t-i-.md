These broads won't give me my props
Twenty-five on the bag, I be stuntin on they ass
and ya mad cause the bitch won't stop


Got your boyfriend feeling like a groupie...
(You know, you know, we know, we on that)
Still life but it's lookin like a movie...
(You know, you know, we know, we on that)
And ev'rybody know who the truth beee....
(You know, you know, we know, we on that)
I blow 'cause I'm blowin on that OOH-WHEE~!!
(You know, you know, we know, we on that)
Hello


Hello, good morning, how you doin? We're at the movie
of "Welcome to the Future," Iâm the Cap'n of the Cool Kids
The revolution's NEVER been televised
Great booty, better thighs, I ain't wanna tell her bye
First I tell her hi, then I give her one and let her fly
Never tell a lie, tonight you couldn't find a better guy
King shit, flyer than anyone you get seen with
Gangsta distinguished, cool as a penguin
Got a team of 'em on the field, finna bring wit
G5 waitin, fly away at my convenience
You seen T.I.P., checkin in a 5-star suite 
with some 5-star freaks, gettin high all week (Let's GO!!!!)
Catch me in the week, I was up all night when y'all sleep
in a fast car, superbad broads, back seat
That's me, see I'm nothin nice, fuck a couple nights
With the moon say goodbye and the sun greetin us like...


Hello...
Good morning... (Let's go, let's ride)
Hello... (Yeah, c'mon)
Good morning...
Hello!....
Good evening!...
You blow...
You feenin...
'Cause you know...
...that you really need it
And I'm the one that you wanna be with
But right now baby, you dreamin -- Wake up and turn the lights off


'Cause I been leanin on the bar, lookin cleaner than a star
These broads won't give me my props
Twenty-five on the bag, I be stuntin on they ass
and ya mad cause the bitch won't stop




Hello... (Let's go)
Good morning... (Let's work)
Hello... (Let's go)
Good morning... (Let's work)
Hello...



Aiyyo..aiyyo, turn me up a lil' bit more
I don't think they can hear me
Check this out...Bad Boy, bitch!
Let's work...c'mon
Let's work...non-stop, let's rock
Make you feel good too, let's work...
Don't stop I see you, let's work
It's that Dirty Money


Uh, how fly is he?
Yo' baby momma (Cry for Me) like Jodeci (let's go)
So how you not notice me?
PUll up to the club in the coldest V
Ugh...literally cold
Little did he know how that nigga Diddy flow
...How that nigga Diddy go 
so hard like a crowbar, still gettin dough
Whoa whoa, whoa... Hahaha (Turn the bass up!)
Hey, I like this (c'mon, can you feel it?)
Can you feel it? ...Nothin can save ya
Uh, it's that Dirty Money (Turn the lights on!)




Hello...
Good morning... (Let's go, let's ride)
Hello... (Yeah, c'mon)
Good morning...
Hello.... 
(H-e-l-l-o, h-e-l-l-o, h-e-l-l-o....)
Hello....
