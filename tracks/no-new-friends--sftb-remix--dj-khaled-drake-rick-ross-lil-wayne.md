(Another one) Yeah I stay down with my day one niggas and we in the club screaming
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no, no new (DJ Khaled!)
Still here with my day one niggas, so you hear me say
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no, no new
I still ride with my day one niggas, I don't really need
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no, no new
I stay down from day one so I say fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas
Fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas
One more time, fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas
Fuck all y'all niggas, stay down from day one so I say
(Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at? Started!)
Uh man this shit so ill that we had to restart it
H-town my second home like I'm James Harden
Money counter go burr', when you sellin' out the garden
Four car garage, porn star ménage
Birdman go brrr cause he know this shit retarded
Fuck her on the floor before we make it to the bed
That's what your ass really call it started from the bottom, yes lord
O-V-O sound man I'm proud of my niggas
Knew that we would make it never doubted my niggas
All my bitches love me if I had a baby mama she would probably be richer then a lot of you niggas aye!
That's luxury dog, day one niggas ya stuck with me dawg
Ever since Youtube niggas been calling me the leader of the new school fuck with me dog, yeah
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no, no new
Still here with my day one niggas, so you hear me say
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no, no new (Let's ride)
I still ride with my day one niggas, I don't really need
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no, no new
I stay down from day one so I say fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas
Fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas
One more time fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas
Fuck all y'all niggas, stay down from day one so I say
Your bitch all in my photographs, ho niggas got hate for me
Big homies all certified, nothing niggas gon' take from me
Follow codes, study game, feed fam' nigga fuck fame
All black my whip foreign, these bad hoes keep tiptoeing
Down in Turks and Caicos, dope boy that's my dress code
All I hug is blood nigga, Khaled that's my flesh tho
All I want is love nigga, money bring that stress though
Smoke good I love life, strip club like e'rry night
E'rry night my same niggas, day one straight menace
Rosé! No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no, no new
Still here with my day one niggas, so you hear me say
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no, no new (Let's ride)
I still ride with my day one niggas, I don't really need
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no, no new
I stay down from day one so I say fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas (Let's go)
Fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas
One more time, fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas
Fuck all y'all niggas, stay down from day one so I say
(Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at? Started!)
Ugh, I'm here with my niggas, I'm too high to be friendly
They throw dirt on my name, well that's why they still dig me
And I'm tired of all this hating, I thank God for my patience
I thank God for my homies, I wish we could trade places
Bitch we good-fellas, boy all them niggas with you they just pall bearers
And if we ball catch us, remember sip slow, live fast
Young Money, stay young I been Cash Money since day one, Tunechi
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no, no new
Still here with my day one niggas, so you hear me say
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no, no new (Let's ride)
I still ride with my day one niggas, I don't really need
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no, no new
I stay down from day one so I say fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas
Fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas
One more time, fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas
Fuck all y'all niggas, stay down from day one so I say
Fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas
Fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas
Fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas
Fuck all y'all niggas
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other bitches cause I'm down for my bitches
