And if she should tell you come closer
And if she tempts you with her charms

Tell her no no no no no-no-no-no
No no no no no-no-no-no
No no no no no
Don't hurt me now for her love belongs to me

And if she should tell you come closer
And if she tempts you with her charms

Tell her no no no no no-no-no-no
No no no no no-no-no-no
(don't take her love for your arms)
No no no no no
Don't hurt me now for her love belongs to me

I know she's the kind of girl
Who'd throw my love away
But I still love her so
Don't hurt me now, don't hurt me now

If she tells you I love you
Just remember she said that to me

Tell her no no no no no-no-no-no
No no no no no-no-no-no
(don't take her love from my arms)
No no no no no
Don't leave her now for her love belongs to me
