In the days of my youth, I was told what it means to be a man
And now I've reached that age, I've tried to do all those things the best I can
No matter how I try, I find my way into the same old jam


Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home with a brown eyed man
Well, I still don't seem to care


Sixteen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be
It only took a couple of days 'til she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine and love me till the end
But when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend, oh


Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man
Well, I still don't seem to care

Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man
Well, I still don't seem to care


I know what it means to be alone
I sure do wish I was at home
I don't care what the neighbours say
I'm gonna love you each and every day
You can feel the beat within my heart
Realize, sweet babe, we ain't ever gonna part
