In the days of my youth, I was told what it means to be a man
Now that I've reached that age, I try to do all those things the best I can
No matter how I tried, I find my way to the same old jam

Good times, bad times, you know I had my share
Well, my woman left home with a brown-eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

Seventeen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be
It only took a couple of days 'til she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine and love me 'til the end
But when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend

Good times, bad times, you know I had my share
Well, my woman left home with a brown-eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

Good times, bad times, you know I had my share
Well, my woman left home with a brown-eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

I know what it means to be alone
I sure do wish I was at home
I don't care what the neighbors say
I'm gonna love you each and every day
You can feel the beat within my heart
Realize, sweet baby, we ain't never gonna part
