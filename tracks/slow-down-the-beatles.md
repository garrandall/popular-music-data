Well, come on pretty baby won't you walk with me?
Come on pretty baby won't you talk with me?
Come on pretty baby give me one more chance
Try to save our romance

Slow down
Baby now you're movin' way too fast
You gotta gimme little lovin', gimme little lovin'
If you want our love to last

Well, I used to walk you home baby after school
Carry your books home too
But now you got a boyfriend down the street
Baby what you're tryin' to do?

You better slow down
Baby now you're movin' way too fast
You gotta gimme little lovin', gimme little lovin'
If you want our love to last

Well, you know that I love you, tell the world I do
Come on pretty baby why can't you be true?
I need your lovin' baby, oh so bad
The best little woman I ever had

Slow down
Baby now you're movin' way too fast
You gotta gimme little lovin', gimme little lovin'
If you want our love to last
