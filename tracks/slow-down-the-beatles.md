Well, come on pretty baby, won't you walk with me?
Come on, pretty baby, won't you talk with me?
Come on pretty baby, give me one more chance
Try to save our romance!

Slow down, baby, now you're moving way too fast
You gotta gimme little lovin', gimme little loving
Ow! If you want our love to last



Well, I used to walk you home, baby, after school
Carry your books home, too
But now you got a boyfriend down the street
Baby what you're trying to do?

You better slow down!
Baby, now you're moving way too fast
You gotta gimme little lovin', gimme little loving
Brrr! If you want our love to last

Oh



Oh

Welllll - you know that I love you, tell the world I do
Come on, pretty baby, why can't you be true?
I need your loving, oh so bad
The best little woman I ever had

Slow down!
Baby, now you're moving way too fast
You gotta gimme little lovin', gimme little loving
Awe! If you want our love to last



Woo!
