Here's a story about a boy who was always in trouble and just because his pappy was a white trader and his mammy was an Indian maid


(Half-breed, half-breed)
Well your pappy was a trader and your mammy was an Indian maid boy (Half-breed)
Your pappy was a trader and your mammy was an Indian maid boy (Half-breed)
We know all about it and we don’t want a half-breed around boy
Before sundown you'd better be out of town boy


Half-breed they're hot on your trail boy
Half-breed but you better not run
Half-breed you’d better get a gun boy
Better get a gun and stand boy
You better get a gun and stand


Well a man is a man as long as his plans are made boy (Half-breed)
A man is a man as long as he can stand unafraid boy (Half-breed)
So don't let 'em dog you no don't you let 'em don't let 'em boy
'Cause you gotta hold to carry and you’re just as necessary as they boy


Half-breed they’re hot on your trail boy
Half-breed but you better not run
Half-breed you'd better get a gun boy
Better get a gun and stand boy
You better get a gun and stand
Half-breed they’re hot on your trail boy
Half-breed but you better not run
Half-breed you'd better get a gun boy
Better get a gun and stand boy
You better get a gun and stand


Half-breed (Half-breed)
Half-breed (Half-breed)
Half-breed (Half-breed)
Half-breed (Half-breed)
