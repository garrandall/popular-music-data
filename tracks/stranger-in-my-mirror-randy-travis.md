There's a stranger in my mirror
Who don't know how to behave
He keeps grinnin' 'bout you
And whistlin' tunes
While he ought to be watchin' me shave
We move alike and we look the same
But I swear we've got totally different brains
And the love we're in with you just makes it clearer
He used to be my twin
Now there's a stranger in my mirror

And he doesn't want to go out drinkin'
With all of his friends, no more
He's got both of us thinkin'
You're what we're livin' for
We've gone crazy and we can't recover
You're always on one mind or the other
I admit we should be certified
He's a little schizophrenic and so am I

There's a stranger in my mirror
Who don't know how to behave
He keeps grinnin' 'bout you
And whistlin' tunes
While he ought to be watchin' me shave
We move alike and we look the same
But I swear we've got totally different brains
And the love we're in with you just makes it clearer
He used to be my twin
Now there's a stranger in my mirror



And he's always doin' little things
I never thought I'd do
Like lookin' at diamond rings
Drawin' hearts and writin' I love you's
Thought it was just a case of mild affection
Until I caught a glimpse of my reflection
I looked up into my own eyes
And saw someone starin' back I didn't recognize

There's a stranger in my mirror
Who don't know how to behave
He keeps grinnin' 'bout you
And whistlin' tunes
While he ought to be watchin' me shave
We move alike and we look the same
But I swear we've got totally different brains
And the love we're in with you just makes it clearer
He used to be my twin
Now there's a stranger in my mirror
Lord, I'm in love with you
And there's a stranger in my mirror...
