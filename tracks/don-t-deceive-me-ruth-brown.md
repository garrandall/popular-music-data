People are talking all over town
They say you're tired of me
Going to put me down

Please don't leave me
Don't deceive me
Please don't go

You know I love you
You know it's true
That's why you treat me
The way you do

You said you loved me
You said you loved me
Please don't go

When I first met you
No, I didn't love you
I just tried to treat you nice

Since I've been with you
Yes, I've learned to love you
And I want you all the
Rest of my life

I used to call you my lover boy
You were always my pride and joy

Please don't leave me
You know you'll grieve me
Please don't go
