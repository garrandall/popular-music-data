Somewhere deep in my body
I feel the magical blow
I'm in need of somebody
And I think you should know

You are my magical baby
Feed my magical soul
Let's find a field where a shade is
You can let your magic unfold

You are my baby
And I think you should know
That I'm feeling the glow

Somewhere deep in my body
I feel the magical blow
(She's starting to feel the glow)
I'm in need of somebody
And I think you should know

I am your magical baby
Feed your magical soul
(She's starts to feel the glow)
In a field with a shade yeah
You can let your magic unfold
