Somethin bout a truck in a farmers field
A no trespass sign, and time to kill
Nobody's gonna get hurt, so what's the big deal
Somethin bout a truck in a farmer's field

Somethin bout beer, sittin on ice
After a long hard day, makes it taste just right
On that dropped tailgate, on a summer night
Somethin bout beer sittin on ice

And there's somethin bout a girl in a red sun dress
With an ice cold beer pressed against her lips
In that farmers field, will make a boy a mess
There's somethin bout a girl in a red sundress

And there's somethin bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more
On that dropped tailgate back behind the corn
The most natural thing you've ever felt before
There's somethin bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more

And there's somethin bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips beggin for another kiss
And there's somethin bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And lord have mercy it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothin bout it luck,
There's somethin bout a truck

Somethin bout a creek, around 2 a.m.
After a few of those beers, you wanna dive on in
You don't need no clothes, so just hang em on a limb
There's somethin bout a creek around 2 a.m.

And there's somethin bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Beggin for another kiss
And there's somethin bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And lord have mercy, it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothin bout it luck, there's somethin bout a truck
Ain't nothin bout it luck, there's somethin bout a truck
