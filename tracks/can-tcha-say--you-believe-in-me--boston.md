Can't you say you believe in me?
Can't you see what you mean to me?


Everyday I think of you
You're on my mind
Some things in the past
Are better left behind
Every night I dream of you
The images as clear as day


Can't you say you believe in me?
Can't you say you believe in me?
You know that where there's a will there's a way
Can't you say you believe in me?
Can't you see what it means to me?
Don't leave me alone tonight
Because I still love you


We've had our time apart
And I knew right from the start
I could never change
The way I feel about you baby
We can sit here all night long
And separate the right from the wrong
But love won't wait

Oh, still in love with you
You know I need you baby, to stand by me
Can't you see I need you, baby
Oh, I'm still in love with you

I love you
