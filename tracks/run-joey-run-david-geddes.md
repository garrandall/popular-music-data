Daddy, please don't
It wasn't his fault
He means so much to me
Daddy, please don't
We're gonna get married
Just you wait and see

Every night, the same old dream
I hate to close my eyes
I can't erase the memory
The sound of Julie's cry

She called me up, late that night
She said, "Joe, don't come over
My Dad and I just had a fight
And he stormed out the door!

I've never seen him act this way
My God, he's goin' crazy
He said he's gonna make you pay
For what we done
He's got a gun!
So run, Joey run, Joey run!"

Daddy, please don't
It wasn't his fault
He means so much to me
Daddy, please don't
We're gonna get married
Just you wait and see

Got in my car
And I drove like mad
'Til I reached Julie's place
She ran to me
With tear-filled eyes and bruises on her face

All at once
I saw him there sneaking up behind me
(Watch out!)
Then Julie yelled, "He's got a gun!"
And she stepped in front of me

Suddenly, a shot rang out
And I saw Julie falling!
I ran to her
I held her close
When I looked down
My hands were red
And here's the last words Julie said

Daddy, please don't
It wasn't his fault
He means so much to me
Daddy, please don't
We're gon...na get... mar...ried......

Run, Joey run, Joey, run
Joey, run, Joey, run
Joey, run, Joey, ruuuuuunn!!!
