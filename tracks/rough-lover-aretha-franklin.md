Now, listen here, girls
I’m going to tell you what I want right now


I want a rough lover
I want a man
I want a rough, tough lover
And I’ll find him if I can
He’s got to bite nails
Fight bears
And if I get sassy
Be a man who dares
To shut me up and kiss me so I know he cares
I want a man


Don’t want a mean daddy
I want a boss
I want a mean, sweet daddy
Who the devil wouldn't cross
He’s got to spit fire
Chew iron
Get mad and start roaring like a mountain lion
Then whisper that he loves me so I know he’s mine
I want a man


I’m looking for a guy who’s brave and strong
But weak for me
I’m looking for a guy who’ll ride around
But never, never set me free


I want a rough lover
I want a man
I want a rough, tough lover
With a sentimental plan
So he can kiss nice
Hug tight
He’s got to be sweet and gentle
Day and night
But mean enough to make me wanna to treat him right
I want a man, oh yeah


I’m looking for a guy who’s brave and strong
But weak for me
I’m looking for a guy who’ll ride around
But never, never set me free


I want a rough lover
I want a man
I want a rough, tough lover
With a sentimental plan
So he can kiss nice
Hug tight
He’s got to be sweet and gentle
Day and night
But mean enough to make me wanna to treat him right
I want a man


I want a man
I don’t want no cream puff, baby
I don’t want no butterfly
I want a man
Oh, yes, I do
Oh, yes, I do
