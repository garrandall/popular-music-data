Now, listen here, girls
Iâm gonna tell you
What I want right now

I want a rough lover
I want a man
I want a rough, tough lover
And Iâll find him if I can

Heâs got to bite nails
Fight bears
And if I get sassy
Be a man who dares
To shut me up and kiss me
So I know he cares
I want a man

Donât want a mean daddy
I want a boss
I want a mean, sweet daddy
Who the devil wouldnât cross

Heâs got to spit fire
Chew iron
Get mad and start roaring
Like a mountain lion
Then whisper that he loves me
So I know heâs mine
I want a man

Iâm looking for a guy
Whoâs big and strong
But weak for me
Iâm looking for a guy
Whoâll ride around
But never, never set me free

I want a rough lover
I want a man
I want a rough, tough lover
With a sentimental plan

So he can kiss nice
Hug tight
Heâs gotta be sweet and gentle
Day and night
But mean enough to make me
Want to treat him right
I want a man, oh, yeah

Iâm looking for a guy
Whoâs raving strong
But weak for me
Iâm looking for a guy
Whoâll ride around
But never, never set me free

I want a rough lover
I want a man
I want a rough, tough lover
With a sentimental plan

So he can kiss nice
Hug tight
Heâs gotta be sweet and gentle
Day and night
But mean enough to make me
Want to treat him right
I want a man

I want a man
I donât want no creampuff, baby
Donât want no butterfly
I want a man

Oh, yes, I do
Oh, yes, I do
