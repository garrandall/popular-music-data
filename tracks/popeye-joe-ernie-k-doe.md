I said, my head goes spinnin' like a spinnin' wheel
When I get the music with the rock 'n' roll beat
There's a dance going 'round from coast to coast
You know now

Yeah, yeah
A brand new dance they call the Popeye Joe, now
Whoa Joe
(Hey Joe)
Here's the thing now, the Popeye Joe

I know, they hully gully in your town
I know, they're mashin' them potatoes
And they're twisting all around
But here's a dance I think you should know now

Yeah, yeah
A brand new dance they call the Popeye Joe, now
Whoa Joe
(Hey Joe)

Here's the thing now, the Popeye Joe
Yeah, yeah Popeye baby
(Hey Joe)

Yeah, yeah, Popeye, baby
I said, you're lookin' good
You and Joe there
Ah, you put your hands on your hips
You go around a little bit
