She's into superstitions
Black cats and voodoo dolls
I feel a premonition
That girl's gonna make me fall

She's into new sensations
New kicks in the candlelight
She's got a new addiction
For every day and night

She'll make you take your clothes off
And go dancing in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life
But she'll take away your pain
Like a bullet to your brain
Come on!

Upside, inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca
Come on!
Livin' la vida loca
Come on!
She's livin' la vida loca

Woke up in New York City
In a funky cheap hotel
She took my heart and she took my money
She must've slipped me a sleeping pill

She never drinks the water
And makes you order French champagne
And once you've had a taste of her
You'll never be the same
Yeah, she'll make you go insane

Upside, inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca
Come on!
Livin' la vida loca
Come on!
She's livin' la vida loca

She'll make you take your clothes off
And go dancing in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life
But she'll take away your pain
Like a bullet to your brain
Come on!

Upside, inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca
Come on!
She's livin' la vida loca
Come on!
She's livin' la vida loca
