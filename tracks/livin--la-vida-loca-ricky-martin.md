She's into superstitions
Black cats and voodoo dolls
I feel a premonition
That girl's gonna make me fall


She's into new sensations
New kicks in the candlelight
She's got a new addiction
For every day and night


She'll make you take your clothes off and go dancing in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life, but she'll take away your pain
Like a bullet to your brain, come on!


Upside, inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca (Come on!)
Livin' la vida loca (Come on!)
She's livin' la vida loca


Woke up in New York city in a funky cheap hotel
She took my heart and she took my money
She must've slipped me a sleeping pill


She never drinks the water, makes you order French champagne
Once you've had a taste of her, you'll never be the same
Yeah, she'll make you go insane (Come on!)


Upside, inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca (Come on!)
She's livin' la vida loca (Come on!)
She's livin' la vida loca


She'll make you take your clothes off and go dancing in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life, but she'll take away your pain
Like a bullet to your brain (Come on!)


Upside, inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca (Come on!)
Upside, inside out
She's livin la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca (Come on!)
She's livin' la vida loca (Come on!)
She's livin' la vida loca (Come on!)


(Come on!)
La vida loca
La vida loca
La vida loca
