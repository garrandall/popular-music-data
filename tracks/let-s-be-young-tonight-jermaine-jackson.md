Ooh, baby, let's be young tonight
Let's go dancing in the party lights
I'll go and shine my shoes, you get your blue dress out
Let's hit the discotheques and we'll turn them out

Yeah, baby, let's be young again
Let's get back, let's get back in the trend
'Cause it's not too late to celebrate
Let's go and wine and dine while we still have time

Come on, baby, let's be young tonight
Whoa, baby, dance in the party light
We're gonna boogie, baby
Boogie, me and my lady

We'll never know
When we'll get this chance again

Ooh, baby, let's be young tonight
Let's go dancing in the party lights
I'll go and shine my shoes, you get your ol' dress out
Let's hit the discotheques and we'll turn them out

Oh, baby, let's be young again
Let's get back, let's get back in the trend
'Cause it's not too late to celebrate
Let's go and wine and dine while we still have time

Come on, baby, woo, let's be young tonight
Whoa, baby, dance in the party lights
Let's get down, baby, hey, hey
Let's get down, baby, whoa, yeah
Come on, baby, come on, yeah
Come on, baby, come on
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Come on now, baby, come on dance with me
Come on now, baby, come on dance with me
Come on now, baby, come on dance with me
Come dance with me

We can sho' 'nuff get it on
We can sho' 'nuff get it on
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, hey, hey
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, hey, hey
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, hey, hey
Doo-doo-doo-doo, hey, hey, hey, hey

You're drivin' me crazy

Oh, let's get back in the trend
'Cause it's not too late to celebrate
