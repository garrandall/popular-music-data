MICKEY:

Hear squeaky clean music with full effect
That? s me, Mickey, the Mouse Supreme
MC-ing the birthday party of my main duck Donald

TAG TEAM: We? re kickin the floor
And we gonna do it sumthin like this

Donald Duck, back again
Turn up the music, let? s begin
Party on, party people, let me hear some noise
Party with Donald, Daisy, and the boys
There? s a party over here, party over there
Tossin? Donald up in the air
Now tryin to catch him, he falls down

WHOOMP, there he went (hit the ground)

WHOOMP, there he went (mickey: go tag team)
WHOOMP, there he went (minnie: get busy)
