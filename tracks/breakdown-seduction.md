You got the notion, a motion
Conclusion that will set us free
It takes us closer and closer
The human that we wanna be

Imperfection was a strife
We couldn't handle but we tried it all
Tried it all, I descend before the countdown
From the notion of emotion
I will wake up when I've learnt to fall
Breaking the spell, the appearance of perfection

It's time to open up the shell
Trace the hidden spell
Into my breakdown
It's my countdown
We gonna shoot out like a gun
Hit and then we run
Into my breakdown
It's my countdown

Give my injection, the poison
Let's believe that's all I need
I can't describe it, the picture was too sharp
We couldn't get it off - no!

A description, my prescription
I can't handle but I've tried it all
My reception a recession to the countdown
From the notion of the motion
I will wake up when I'm already gone
Breaking my shell, I initiate deception

It's time to open up the shell
Trace the hidden spell
Into my breakdown
It's my countdown
We gonna shoot out like a gun
Hit and then we run
Into my breakdown
It's my countdown

Vanity is my profession, follow my lead
Letting it free my seduction, I count down
Vice is my obsession (Cellar lobotomy, act as my remedy)
Sell me self-deception, my addiction

It's my obsession the pressure
To be a slave for what I trace
I force it higher and higher
The dose I need to inhale, oh yeah

I wanna swing around in hell
I'm gonna scream and shout it out in vain
Tried it all, I descend before the countdown
Be aware that I will wake up
If I'm not already dead
Breaking the spell, the appearance of perfection

It's time to open up the shell
Trace the hidden spell
Into my breakdown
It's my countdown

It's time to open up the shell
Trace the hidden spell
Into my breakdown
It's my countdown
We gonna shoot out like a gun
Hit and then we run
Into my breakdown
It's my countdown

It's time to open up the shell
Trace the hidden spell
Into my breakdown
It's my countdown
We gonna shoot out like a gun
Hit and then we run
Into my breakdown
Now I shut down
My countdown
