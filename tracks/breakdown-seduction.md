In the beginning, your love was true
And I gave to you
My inner emotions, yo
I was a slave to you
If time can heal all wounds
Then I feel one
The path of the broken heart is what we'll run

You treat me fine
So you say
If I walk away
I'm justified
Cause I cried each and every day

We used to talk
Hold hands for a long walk
Stretch on the beach for tans on the broad cold
Call me up late at night for a small kiss
The movies, the mall
It ain't easy being dissed
You love me
But time can change in a big way


The deck is strong but the hull, it'll give way
You used to give the best to me, come next to me
Take some for self and give all the rest to me
But that's dwindled, I sit by the window
Hope for the rain to stop and get rekindled
Love to us at first reinforced it
But now when I call you sound like you lost it
If this is true then I say this to you
Tell me what to do, do...

Our love is breaking down
Oooh, yeah
Our love affair is crumbling down
Our love is breaking down
Oooh, yeah
Our true love is finally coming to its end

I get to the point sometimes when I think back
You don't really love me, nah
I shouldn't think that
Friends they rif and say that you'll diss me
A week's gone by
And you don't even miss me

So if I tell you what I feel
You gotta tell me if it's real
You're breaking down my heart
And tearing me apart
And I appeal for you to stop
And notice me and get very close to me

You used to be my one and only
Now you're a ghost to me
Although my love will never stop
I think we're headed for a drop

You used to take me out a lot
Buy me flowers in a pot
Twenty five forget-me-nots going to the malt shop
Sharing everything we got
Tell me why you changed the plot
You don't even come
Or put a coin in the slot

Like a fish that is baiting
I'm tired of waiting
You said you would meet me at six
Now it's eight and I'm tired of crying
Hurt intensifying
The romance's shy
I'm trying and sighing and dying

Our love is breaking down
Oooh, yeah
Our love affair is crumbling down
Our love is breaking down
Oooh, yeah
Our true love is finally coming to its end

Our love is breaking down
Oooh, yeah
Our love affair is crumbling down
Our love is breaking down
Oooh, yeah
Our true love is finally coming to its end

(Our love is breaking down)
You used to be so sweet to me
(Our love is breaking down)
We used to be so happy
(Our love is breaking down)
A better love could not be found
(Our love is breaking down)
But now our love is breaking down

The love I found you put me down
You lost me
You cost me
A whole bunch of time
Now you boss me around

It's rainy, it's sunny
My eyeballs are runny
I'm just like your money
You break me and honey
You come back to score like a ship with a shore
And therefore I can't take it no more

Together
Tougher than leather
Through any kind of weather
And I never thought that it would sever
Or come to this, I try to miss
But I don't see you enough
Or let alone get a kiss
I'd like to grace the place you ace hang out or embrace

So I could suck your face
And get a taste
Sometimes I state 'em
And often hate 'em
But our love has come to this an ultimatun

I'm not your superwoman
Just assuming
That you will come home and caress me
I'm human, sweetheart

I'm tender up and surrender
I don't wanna go out like this
But I'm the best in this gender
My love is forsaken
My heartbeat is shaken
I'm not gonna make it
And no, I can't fake it

So love me or leave me
But don't disbelieve me
Accept me, reject me
But don't disrespect me
So get it together
So we can exist and reminisce bliss, bliss

Our love is breaking down
Oooh, yeah
Our love affair is crumbling down
Our love is breaking down
Oooh, yeah
Our true love is finally coming to its end
