All I do is think about you baby
Every mornin', every night
Ready, yes I'm ready for your lovin'
So get your lovin ready for mine

I've been trying to reach you, girl
Haven't taken time to relax
I've been gone for long while
But babe now I'm back

You're all I've been thinking 'bout
Mornin', noon and night
And I knew I would find you girl
No matter what the price

Since I left you girl
I've been around the world
Learning at the cost of lifes expense
But now I plainly see, that what you gave to me
Was more that i could ever comprehend
Then...

All I do is think about you baby
Every mornin', every night
Ready, yes I'm ready for your lovin'
So get your lovin ready for mine

If you just give me half a chance
Let me show you just how I feel, babe
I would only be good to you
And baby that's for real

Since I left you girl
I've been around the world
Learning at the cost of lifes expense
But now I plainly see, that what you gave to me
Was more that i could ever comprehend
Then...

But I'm older and wiser now
And i know what's best for myself babe
And I'd rather be with you girl
Than anybody else

So come on, on girl
Aaaahahhh

All I do is think about you baby
Every mornin', every night
Ready, yes I'm ready for your lovin'
So get your lovin ready for mine

Ready for your love
For your love
For your love
Baby
