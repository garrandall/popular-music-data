Understanding is the best thing in the world
Between a boy and a girl
Boy and girl and even a woman or a man
It's always better when you really understand


You know understanding is a mighty powerful thing
That's why it makes me so sad
When I see my friends wandering around through the world
Never knowing the meaning of the word
Understanding, so in the next few minutes, I'm going to
Try to explain just exactly what it means
Now wait a minute, listen, for instance, you take me
And my old lady, we got to good thing going
Because I know If I don't work and pay the rent and the
Bills and buy her fine pretty clothes to wear well
There are fifteen other guys just waiting round the
Corner, and I don't care how much that woman loves me
She's going to go out and find herself one of them who
Will and that's why I believe that




Now listen I don't want you to think that this is a
One sided affair, no no
Because my old lady also understands that a man must
Have respect
What I mean is, if she must play around don't let me
Catch her, because what I don't see can't hurt me, you
Understand? but on the other hand, If I should ever
Catch her I'm not gonna talk about-a
And call her a bunch of bad names like you all might
No no mh
What I'm going to do, I'm going to go down-town to the
Hardware store and buy myself a double blade axe
Come back, square off, and believe her soul's going to
Belong to the good lord
Because her head's gonna belong to me, and I
Guarantee she'll know what I mean when I'll say
