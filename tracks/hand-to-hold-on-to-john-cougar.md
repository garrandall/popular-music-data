You can laugh and joke and make fun of your friends
Spin in the middle when the troubles begin
Take it nice and easy and always pretend
That you're cool, so cool, so cool

Say I'm alone and I'm wild and I will not be tamed
Talk like a jerk or an educated brain
Be an old girl drivin' the young boys insane
Be a joker, a preacher, it does not matter

Every one needs a hand to hold on to
Every one needs a hand to hold on to
Don't need to be no strong hand
Don't need to be no rich hand
Every one just needs a hand to hold on to

Havin' good luck with your financial situation
Play the ponies, be president of the United Nation
Go to work and be a Hollywood stud
Drive your four-wheel drive right into the mud, but

Every one needs a hand to hold on to
Every one needs a hand to hold on to
Don't need to be no strong hand
Don't need to be no rich hand
Every one just needs a hand to hold on to

And then those hours when you're alone
And there's nobody there except yourself
I know it, you wanna pick up the phone
And say, "Talk to me, talk to me
Somebody please talk to me"
Yeah

Oh, yeah

Every one needs a hand to hold on to
Every one needs a hand to hold on to
Don't need to be no strong hand
Don't need to be no rich hand

Every one needs a hand to hold on to
Every one needs a hand to hold on to
Don't need to be no strong hand
Don't need to be no rich hand

Every one needs a hand to hold on to
Every one needs a hand to hold on to
Don't need to be no strong hand
Don't need to be no rich hand
