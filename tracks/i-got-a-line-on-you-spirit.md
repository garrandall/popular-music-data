Let me take you baby, down to the river bed
Got to tell you somethin', go right to your head
Cause I got a line on you, babe
I got a line on you

Gotta put your arms around me
With every bit of your love
If you know what to do, I'll make love to you
Cause you got the right line to make it through these times
I got a line on you babe
I got a line on you babe
I got a line on you babe

I got a line on you
I got a line on you babe
You know my winter's almost over
My summer, she's comin' on strong

I can love you, love you, love you
Love you all year long
I got a line on you babe
I got a line on you
I got a line on you babe
I got a line on you
I got a line on you babe
