Call for love
I would call you up
Cause you're my automatic lover, you're number one
Call for love
I would call you up
Cause you're my automatic (automatic)
My automatic lover

Can you feel the force
Yeah can you feel it, can you deal with
My reincarnation and combination
With absolute sophistication
Deep deep down, deep in my heart may beat
You know there's something deep inside, a kind of mystery
So if you really need to satisfy your burning desire
You'd better call me up and I will set you on fire

I feel my love is going stronger
I can't fight this feeling

I need your loving all night long
I can't control myself

You wish is my command
I'm teacher not a man
Cause I got everything it takes to be
Your everlasting friend
You know, I'm someone very special
A brand new love attraction
And if you dial my number, I will give you satisfaction
Yes, call for love, get in touch with me
So feel my super magic space erotic ecstasy

I feel my love is going stronger
I can't fight this feeling
I need your loving all night long
I can't control myself
