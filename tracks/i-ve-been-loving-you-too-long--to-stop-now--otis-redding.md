Letra de "Otis Redding - I've Been Loving You Too Long (1965) - Otis Redding - These arms of mine (1964) - Otis Redding - Try a Little Tenderness (1966)"

...loving you too long, to stop now

You are tired and you want to be free
My love is growing stronger, as you become a habit to me
Ohh, I've been loving you too long
I don't wanna stop now

With you my life has been so wonderful
I can't stop now
You are tired and your love is growing cold
My love is growing stronger as our affair, affair grows old
I've been loving you oh, too long
I don't want to stop now, oh, oh, oh

I've been loving you a little too long
I don't wanna stop now, oh, oh, oh
And don't make me...


...mine
They are lonely
Lonely and feeling blue
These arms of mine
They are yearning
Yearning from wanting you

And if you
Would let them hold you
Oh, how grateful I will be

These arms of mine
They are burning
Burning from wanting you
These arms of mine
They are wanting
Wanting to hold you

And if you
Would let them hold you
Oh, how grateful I will be


Oh, she may be weary
Young girls they do get weary
Wearing that same old shaggy dress, yeah yeah

You know she's waiting
Just anticipating
For things that she'll never, never, never, never possess, yeah yeah
But while she's there waiting, without them
Try a little tenderness (that's all you gotta do)

It's not just sentimental, no, no, no
She has her grief and care, yeah yeah yeah
But the soft words, they are spoke so gentle, yeah
It makes it easier, easier to bear, yeah

You won't regret it, no, no
Some girls they don't forget it
Love is their only happiness, yeah
But it's all so easy
All you gotta do is try, try a little tenderness, yeah
All you gotta do is, man, hold her where you want her

Squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her
Get to her, try, try
Just try a little tenderness, ohyeah yeah yeah
You got to know how to love her, man, you'll be surprised, man
You've got to squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave
You've got to hold her and rub her softly
Try a little tenderness, ohyeah yeah yeah
You've got to rub her gentle man, all you gotta do, no no
You've got to love her, squeeze her, don't tease her
Gotta try nah nah nah, try
Try a little tenderness, yeah, watch her groove
You've gotta to know what to do, man
