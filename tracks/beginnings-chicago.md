When I'm with you, it doesn't matter where we are,
Or what we're doing. I'm with you, that's all that matters.
Time passes much too quickly when we're together laughing.
I wish I could sing it to you, oh no,
I wish I could sing it to you.
Mostly I'm silent.
Never think about words to say.
When I kiss you, I feel a thousand different feelings.
The color of chills all over my body.
And when I feel them, I quickly try to decide which one
I should try to put into words, oh no,
Try to put into words.
Mostly I'm silent.
Only the beginning of what I want to feel forever.
Only the beginning. Only just the start.
I've got to get you into my life.
Got to get you next to me.
Only the beginning. Only just the start.
