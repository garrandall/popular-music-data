Roll on roll on
We got so much going on
Summer means that we can walk through flowers
Or we can lay in the sun for hours
Nothing never really brings me down love
As long as you are here with me
I can't help myself
Roll on little girl
Roll ons in my mind in my heart and I find
The time we can stop
And let it all take hold
And let it, let it grow
Roll on roll on
We got so much going on
Roll on roll on
We got so much going on
Love to watch you walk at night through white sands
Love the touch of your hand in my hand
Nothing ever really brings me down love
As long as you are here with me
I can't help myself
Roll on little girl
Roll ons in my mind in my heart and I find
The time we can stop
And let it all take hold
And let it, let it grow
Roll on roll on
We got so much going on
On your face, when I brought you that coffee
The warmth of your smile makes me love you more, yeah
Roll on roll on
We got so much going on
