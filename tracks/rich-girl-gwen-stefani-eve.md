If I was a rich girl
See, I'd have all the money in the world,
If I was a wealthy girl
No man could test me,
Impress me,
My cash flow would never ever end
'Cause I'd have all the money in the world,
If I was a wealthy girl

Think what that money could bring
I'd buy everything
Clean out Vivienne Westwood
In my Galliano gown

No, wouldn't just have one hood
A Hollywood mansion if I could
Please book me first class
To my fancy house in London town

All the riches baby won't mean anything
All the riches baby won't bring what your love can bring
All the riches baby won't mean anything
Don't need no other baby
Your lovin' is better than gold and I know

If I was a rich girl
See, I'd have all the money in the world,
If I was a wealthy girl
No man could test me,
Impress me,
My cash flow would never ever end
'Cause I'd have all the money in the world,
If I was a wealthy girl

I'd get me four Harajuku girls to
Inspire me and they'd come to my rescue
I'd dress them wicked,
I'd give them names
Love, Angel, Music, Baby
Hurry up and come and save me

All the riches baby won't mean anything
All the riches baby won't bring what your love can bring
All the riches baby won't mean anything
Don't need no other baby
Your lovin' is better than gold and I know


Come together all over the world
From the hoods of Japan Harajuku girls
What? It's all love
What? Give it up
What?
(shouldn't matter) 
What?

Come together all over the world
From the hoods of Japan Harajuku girls
What? It's all the love
What? Give it up
What?
(shouldn't matter) 

What happened to my life? Turned upside down
Chicks that blew ya mind, ding, it's the second round
Original track and ting
You know you can't buy these things
See Stefani and her L.A.M.B.
I rock the fetish people you know who I am


Yes ma'am, we got the style that's wicked
I hope you can all keep up
We climbed all the way from the bottom to the top
Now we ain't gettin' nothing but love

If I was a rich girl
See, I'd have all the money in the world,
If I was a wealthy girl
No man could test me,
Impress me,
My cash flow would never ever end
'Cause I'd have all the money in the world,
If I was a wealthy girl
