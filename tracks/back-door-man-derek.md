You left me moaning at
Your back door
The dog is barking I'm
Back for more
'Til every day
And every night

The mood is gonna fit you
And the feeling's gonna make it alright

I'm talking power failure
For what I choose
Women want a man
I act a fool
I'll make it up to you
In due time

Until the mood is gonna fit you
The feeling's gonna make it alright

All I do
All I do is think about you
All I do
In the morning, at night
I think about you, baby
I can't sleep at night
