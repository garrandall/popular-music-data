I'm a greedy lover for lovin'
Only for you
I'm a choosy lover
'Cause only your love will do
Not like one who finds true lovin'
Yet searches for more lovin'
Their whole life through

Not me because I'm an easy take
When love is here to make like this
I'll tell you that I'm a kissin' fool
When under the magic of your kiss
Oooh, not like one who finds the sweetest
But cannot believe that the best will do
I tell you I know nobody else but you
Can do for me what you do, baby

I think it's love, darling
I really do
I think you feel, darling
The same way, too

I'm a woman lover
Whenever it's you with me
I'm your sweet surrender
If you'll stay in love eternally

Oooh, I've no time for vacillating
Asking me if I am a happy man
I tell you, I know, I know I am
I got love, we've got love
In the palm of our hands

I think it's love, darling
I really do
I think you feel, darling
The same way, too

I know it's real, darling
I really do
I think you feel, darling
The same way, too

Oooh, I've no time for vacillating
Asking me if I am a happy man
I tell you, I know, I know I am
I got love, we've got love
In the palm of our hands

I think it's love, darling
I really do
I think you feel, darling
The same way, too

I know it's real darling
I really do
I think you feel darling
The same way too

I think it's love, darling
I really do
I think you feel, darling
The same way, too
