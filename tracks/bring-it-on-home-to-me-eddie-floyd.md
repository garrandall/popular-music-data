Yea, real nigga talk
Ain't just a motherfuckin phrase
It's a motherfuckin lifestyle
Brrrrrrrap!


If you got your firearms in your hands
But your gun found safety
Fight, everybody came to fight
Everybody came to fight, everybody came to fo fo fo fo fight
If you got your firearms in your hands
But your gun found safety
Fight, everybody came to fight
Everybody came to fight, but your gun found safety


I'm a Harlem nigga, blood line AZ, Al Porter
Niggas can't fuck with me like the massive daughter
I hit the strip, all the fiends know my name
I have the old school coke, I call it Novocain
You be Uncle Fester, light on your brain
And I'm Morticia the way a nigga hold a thing
I could have them fancy cars and them two's on
I rather have my fucking crown made out of thorns
Crucify me to God, you can try me
Come back three days later thinking they moved the body
Took my spirit form, them boys ignored him
They didn't heath the warning, now the wrath pouring on 'em
I do this for my niggas sitting on them corners
Can't get a job, felonies forever haunt them
Niggas talk warring, kicking down your door in
Till them joints draw 'em and then they all turn mourning


If you got your firearms in your hands
But your gun found safety
Fight, everybody came to fight
Everybody came to fight, everybody came to fo fo fo fo fight


The nickel-less, broke niggas used to a little bit
Ignorant to the dollar
Piggy back, let you follow, mama slipped into pink
Leaving pick up, she can't
All the working in the world and ain't got shit in the bank
What you think?
Shit is real, real niggas know how I feel
As your arm broad your carve knife, you ain't got skill
You buzzing, that's nothing, they fireflies
I swat them all, I'm a slaughterhouse full of cow hide
You put nothing in the box, with biscuits and hot fries
Your son gonna see chicken when he look in his pop eyes
This shit is suicide, being we, we unified
One nigga go down, get us all crucified
I know the struggle when niggas hustle to stay alive
Governor ran off, fuck it then, we creating jobs
I lay the odds to the table, labels be playing God
But it was Jesus who took the water and made it wine
Oh, I get it, fresh home, used to switching leathers
Your man told you I'm a bring it better, it's whatever
Hit the jet, hidden compartment to fit the leather
You might pick that bat up, but never pick your head up
I hope you get your spit together, get your shit together
Yeah, you won't go from doing music to a missing record


If you got your firearms in your hands
But your gun found safety
Fight, everybody came to fight
Everybody came to fight, everybody came to fo fo fo fo fight


Like my man said, we pull up on them 24's
Jet black, tinted, staying at the Bentley doors
In the club rose and Henney pour
The whole section drunk, we gonna need 20 more
We hit the Louis store, all I know is gimme, gimme
I recognize a fake nigga, vision 20-20
Popping Magnum V-12 engine, hear me, hear me
Beyonce face on once cent, that's a pretty penny
They say them Harlem niggas pretty boy Floyd with the hand action
Thorough borough bread, but I ain't your man... hattan
Every bar he go hard, candy cracking
Go mami, I'm an Eddie Murphy movie, you on a roll, I played everybody
The gang rewind, the thugs love,
The ladies vibe, the thugs love, the ladies fall
I feel at home in my city, that state of mind


If you got your firearms in your hands
But your gun found safety
Fight, everybody came to fight
Everybody came to fight, everybody came to fo fo fo fo fight

Sound boy barrier
It's gonna be a sound boy barrier
