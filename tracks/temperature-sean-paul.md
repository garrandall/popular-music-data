The gal them Schillaci
Sean da Paul
So me give it to... so me give to... so me give it to to all girls
Five million and forty naughty shorty
Baby girl, all my girls, all my girls
Sean da Paul say

Well woman the way the time cold I wanna be keepin' you warm
I got the right temperature for shelter you from the storm
Oh lord, gal I got the right tactics to turn you on
And girl I wanna be the papa, you can be the mom

Make I see the gal them bruk out 'pon the floor from you don't want no worthless performer
From you don't want no man they can't turn you on gal make I see your hand them up on ya
Can't tan 'pon it long, naw eat no yam, no steam fish, nor no green banana
But down in Jamaica we give it to you hot like a sauna

Well woman the way the time cold I wanna be keepin' you warm
I got the right temperature for shelter you from the storm
Oh lord, gal I got the right tactics to turn you on
And girl I wanna be the papa, you can be the mom

Bumper exposed and gal you got your chest out but you no wasters 'cause gal you impress out
And if you des out a me you fi test out
'Cause I got the remedy to make you de-stress out
Me haffi flaunt it because me God Bless out, and girl if you want it you haffi confess out
A no lie weh we need set speed a fi test the mattress out

Well woman the way the time cold I wanna be keepin' you warm
I got the right temperature for shelter you from the storm
Oh lord, gal I got the right tactics to turn you on
And girl I wanna be the papa, you can be the mom

Gal don't say me crazy now,
This strange love it a no Bridgette and Flava show
Time fi a make baby now
So stop gwaan like you a act shady yo

Woman don't play me know,
'Cause I no Fred Sanford nor Grady yo
My lovin' is the way to go
My lovin' is the way to go

Well woman the way the time cold I wanna be keepin' you warm
I got the right temperature for shelter you from the storm
Oh lord, gal I got the right tactics to turn you on
And girl I wanna be the papa, you can be the mom

When you roll with a player like me, with a bredda like me girl there is no other
No need to talk it right here just park it right here keep it undercover

From me love how you fit inna you blouse and you fat inna you jeans and mi waan discover
Everything bout you baby girl can you hear when me utter

Well woman the way the time cold I wanna be keepin' you warm
I got the right temperature for shelter you from the storm
Oh lord, gal I got the right tactics to turn you on
And girl I wanna be the papa, you can be the mom

Make I see the gal them bruk out 'pon the floor from you don't want no worthless performer
From you don't want no man wey can't turn you on gal make I see your hand them up on ya
Can't tan 'pon it long, naw eat no yam, no steam fish, nor no green banana
But down in Jamaica we give it to you hot like a sauna

Well woman the way the time cold I wanna be keepin' you warm
I got the right temperature for shelter you from the storm
Oh lord, gal I got the right tactics to turn you on
And girl I wanna be the papa, you can be the mom
