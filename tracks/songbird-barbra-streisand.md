Songbird sings from the heart
Each word can tear you apart
I sing - you sing along
You find your life in my song
When you need the strength to carry on
You've got me to turn to
With the songs that I sing
And the magic they bring
They've helped you be strong now
The song sets you free
But who sings to me
I'm all alone now
Who sings for songbird
Sometimes
When I' m all alone
I sing my saddest song
Lonely, and no one can see
This time the song is for me
I can touch your secret place inside
And still you don't know me
With the songs that I sing
And the magic they bring
You've learned to be strong now
The song sets you free
But who sings to me
I'm all alone now
Where is my songbird,
Where is my songbird,
Who sings his song for me?
