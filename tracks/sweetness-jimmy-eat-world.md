If you're listening
Sing it back
String from your tether unwinds
(string from your tether unwinds)
Up and outward to bind
(Up and outward to bind)

I was spinning free
With a little sweet
And simple numbing me

Are you listening?
Sing it back
So tell me what do I need
(tell me what do I need)
When words lose their meaning
(When words lose their meaning)

I was spinning free
With a little sweet
And simple numbing me

Yeah, stumble 'til you crawl
Sinking into sweet uncertainty

Are you listening? Are you listening?

If you're listening
If you're listening. Are you listening?
Sing it back
If you're listening. Are you listening?

And I'm still running away
I'm still running away
I won't play your hide and seek game
(Your hide and seek game)

I was spinning free
With a little sweet
And simple numbing me

What a dizzy dance
This sweetness will not be concerned with me
No the sweetness will not be concerned with me
No the sweetness will not be concerned with me
