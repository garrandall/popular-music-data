What you doing in this place?
Well, I could probably ask you the same thing
Another round, girl, what you think?
If you're buying, well, you know I'll drink
Some, make it 707
Do you want it on the rocks?
A double shot of heaven
Spilling out the top
And we'll go...


Shot, for shot, for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock, that's gonna stop
A night that we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up
Flip it around and snap a payback picture
(Send it to my ex)
I'll send it to my ex
And send them both a text saying
"We ain't going home alone tonight"
Girl you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight


Slow country from a cover band
I got you covered if you don't know how to dance
But if you want, we could grab a cab
Girl, we got all night, I got a bottomless tab
So let's go...


Shot, for shot, for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock, that's gonna stop
A night that we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up
Flip it around and snap a payback picture
(Send it to my ex)
I'll send it to my ex
And send them both a text saying
"We ain't going home alone tonight"
Girl you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight


It feels too good to let it end right here
I ain't going home alone tonight
(So, let's not let it end, let it end right here)
Girl, you're going home with me
So let's go...


Shot, for shot, for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock, that's gonna stop
A night that we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up
Flip it around and snap a payback picture
(Send it to my ex)
I'll send it to my ex
And send them both a text saying
"We ain't going home alone tonight"
Girl you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight


(No, I ain't going home alone tonight)
Girl you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight
(Baby, don't let me go home alone )
Home alone tonight
