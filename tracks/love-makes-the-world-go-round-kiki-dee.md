You know love makes the world go round
And love makes the see-saw go up and down
And it makes the trees grow tall
And most important thing of all
It makes a boy and girl
Hope
Say it feels so fine now


Without love flowers wouldn't grow in spring
And without dreams the birds just couldn't sing
Oh everybody needs love
And to watch the twinkling stars above
It makes a boy and girl
Yeah
Say that it feels so fine now


Oh everybody needs love
And to watch the twinkling stars above
It makes a boy and girl
Yeah
Say that it feels so fine now


Love makes you cry now
That goes for Billy, Gerry, Bobby, Marti and baby
I said you and I
I could prove to you
That these facts of love are so true
It takes a boy and girl
Yeah
Say that it feels so fine now


Love makes the world go round
You know love makes you feel so fine
Oh everybody
Everybody needs some loving
