I don't know why I came here tonight
I don't know how this all got started...
I'm so tired of not being right--
Of being one of the broken-hearted

I don't even know your name
But, Darling, just the same...

(CHORUS:)
Whoever you are, I'm falling in love again
... falling in love again
Whoever you are, I'm falling in love again
... falling in love again...

Killing time with a drink or two
Or maybe some conversation
I had nothing really better to do
Now I'm looking for explanations

I'm so tired of love's sweet lies
But they're not in your eyes...

(CHORUS)

(BRIDGE:)
You know, my heart's been hiding
... but you walked in and took it away
Now there's something that
I gotta say, Darling...

(CHORUS)

I don't know why I came here tonight
I don't know how this all got started...

(CHORUS)
