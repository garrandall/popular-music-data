Trains and bloats and planes are passing by
They mean a trip to Paris or Rome
For someone else but not for me
The trains and the boats and planes
Took you away, away from me

We were so in love and high above
We had a star to wish upon
Wish and dreams come true, but not for me
The trains and the boats and planes
Took you away, away from me

You are from another part of the world
You had to go back awhile and then
You said you soon would return again
I'm waiting here like I promised to
I'm waiting here, but where are you

Oh...oh...trains and boats and planes took you away
But every time I see him I pray
And if my prayer can cross the sea
The trains and the boats and planes
Will bring back you back, back home to me, whoa...oh...

Mmm...mmm...mmm...mmm...mmm
Mmm...mmm...mmm...mmm
Mmm...mmm...mmm...mmm...mmm...mmm...mmm...mmm
Mmm...mmm...mmm...mmm...mmm
Mmm...mmm...mmm
The trains and the boats and planes
Will bring you back, back home to me, whoa, whoa

Mmm...mmm...mmm...mmm...mmm
Mmm...mmm...mmm...mmm
Mmm...mmm...mmm...mmm...mmm...mmm...mmm...mmm
Mmm...mmm...mmm...mmm...mmm
Mmm...mmm...mmm
