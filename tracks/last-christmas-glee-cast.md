Alright you chipmunks, ready to sing your song?


I say we are!


Yeah, let's sing it now!


Okay Rachel?


Okay


Okay Santana?


Okay


Okay Kurt?...Kurt?...KURT!


OKAY!


Christmas, Christmas time is near
Time for toys and time for cheer
We've been good, but we can't last
Hurry Christmas, hurry fast
Want a plane that loops the loop


Me, I want a hula hoop


We can hardly stand the wait
Please Christmas, don't be late


Ok Fellas, Get ready.
That was very good, Rachel.


Naturally!


Very Good Santana


He He He He


Uh Kurt, You were a little flat
Watch it, Kurt...Kurt?...KURT!


OKAY!


Want a plane that loops the loop


I still want a hula hoop


We can hardly stand the wait
Please Christmas, don't be late
We can hardly stand the wait
Please Christmas, don't be late
