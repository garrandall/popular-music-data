Bum, bum-bum-bum, bum-bum-bum-bum, bum, bum-bum
Bum, bum-bum-bum, bum-bum-bum-bum, bum, bum-bum (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bum, bum-bum-bum, bum-bum-bum-bum, bum, bum-bum (Haah)
Bum, bum-bum-bum, bum-bum-bum-bum, bum, bum-bum


Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (Gave it away)
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)


Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me baby, do you recognize me? (Ooh)
Well, it's been a year


It doesn't surprise me (Yeah)


(Rachel: Christmas) I wrapped it up and sent it


With a note saying ("I love you", I meant it)


Now I know what a fool I've been
(But if you) kissed me now
(I know) you'd fool me again


Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
And the very next day you gave it away (Gave it away)
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone


Special (I'll give it someone special)
Special

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day
Gave it away (-Oh, yeah-)
(:This year:)
(|To save me from tears|) (-Save me from tears-)
I'll give it to someone special (I'll give it someone special)


Bum, bum, bum, bum-bum-bum-bum-bum, bum-bum (Whoa, hee)
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum bum (Oh-oh-oh-ooh)
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum (Ha)


A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice


My god, I thought you were someone to rely on (Someone to rely on)
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on


A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (Ooh, woah)
(Ooh) A man under cover but you tore me apart (Ooh, ooh)


(Now I've) found a real love you'll never fool me again


Last Christmas, I gave you my heart (Gave you my heart)


And the very next day (Very next day)
You gave it away
This year, to save me from tears (Save me from tears)
I'll give it to someone special


Last Christmas, I gave you my heart (Ooh, ooh)


But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave me away)
This year to save me from tears (Oh)
I'll give it to someone special (I'll give it to someone) (Special)


Bum, bum, bum, bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum bum, bum (Gave you my heart)
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
