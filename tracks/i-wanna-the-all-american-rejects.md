I never thought that I was so blind
I can finally see the truth
It's me for you
Tonight you can't imagine that I'm by your side
Because it's never gonna be the truth
Too far for you


But can you hear me say?
Don't throw me away
And there's no way out
I gotta hold you somehow


I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every day but all I have is time
Our loves the perfect crime
I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every way and when they set me free
Just put your hands on me


Take everything that I know you'll break
And I give my life away
So far for you


But can you hear me say
Don't throw me away
There's no way out
I gotta hold you somehow


I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every day but all I have is time
Our love's the perfect crime
I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every way and when they set me free
Just put your hands on me


Tonight I'm weak (Tonight I'm weak)
It's just another day without you
That I can't sleep (That I can't sleep)
I gave away the world for you to
Hear me say
Don't throw me away (Don't throw me away)
There's no way out
I gotta hold you somehow


I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every day but all I have is time
Our loves the perfect crime
I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every way and when they set me free
Just put your hands on me
I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every day but all I have is time
Our love's the perfect crime
I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every way and when they set me free
Just put your hands on me
