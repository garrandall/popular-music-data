I speak to myself sometimes, and I say,
"Oh my in a lot of ways, you're a lucky guy and
Now all you need is a chance to try any love"

In my heart there's a need to shout
Dyin', screamin', cryin' let me out, hey
Are all those feelings that want to touch any love?

What a world for the lonely guy
Sometimes I feel I'm gonna lose my mind, my mind
Can anybody tell me just where to find any love, any love?

And oh, everyone needs a love no doubt, any love, any love
And oh, everybody feels alone without any love, any love
And I know there's a love waiting to enter my life, enter my life

Every day as I live, I try to think positive
And I, I pray for someone good to come, any love

Ooh, love is sweet and so divine
And I can't wait for my love life to shine, to shine
Can anybody tell me where I can find any love, any love?

And oh, everyone needs a love no doubt, any love, any love
Everybody feels alone without any love, any love
And I know there's someone waiting for me
To enter my life, come into my life

Suddenly out of the clear, blue sky, lonely tears start to fill my eyes
I can weep, but I refuse to cry, I've got to keep holdin' on
I've got to be very strong, to keep holdin' on

Everyone needs a love no doubt, any love, any love
And oh, everybody feels alone without any love, any love
And I know, I know, I know, I know now she'll come into my life
Into my, into my life

Everyone needs a love no doubt, any love, any love
Everybody feels lonely without any love, any love, any love yeah
And I need you, yeah should've been in my mind, in my mind
Everyone needs a love no doubt, any love, any love
Everybody feels lonely without any love, any love, ooh
