Ay yo Track Boys
This possibly be the biggest remix ever
Lets go!


A here comes the B to the C to the D
No cat out the Lou gangsta as me
Ya'll hit two, I'm jus goin' for three
Bottle full of Cris, but I still rock a T
And ya'll gotta love the fact that I'm from the streets
Drink so much that it fucked up my T
People wasn't drunk, so why they wanna be
Cuz you get eleven thousand spins in a week
Here comes the C to the B to the A
Never fall off like B2K
Wanna get tipsy, you one drink away
Why would I buy when it's better when you pay
Track Boys from the Lou, Jermaine from the A
But they got the boy gettin Tipsy with Sway
Then she said she had somethin to say "One hit wonder"
Bitch I'm here to stay!


Now everybody everybody everybody everybody 
Everybody in the club gettin tipsy
Now everybody everybody everybody everybody 
Everybody in the club gettin tipsy


I pulled up to the club already filthy
She say she don't get fucked
She innocent til proven guilty
Walkin VIP, cats screamin GIB
Skull cap with a bib? on the back DTP
This girl staring so I put a spell on her like a gypsy
We bought up the bar with hundreds
Some drunk not tipsy
Don't trip cuz the whole St. Louis is riding with me
Cats start hating, tell them people come get me
Yeah!
Here comes the king of the Midwest
C H to the I to the N to the G Y
My homies in the back puffin on some ooo wee
I know the owner so I snuck in the ooo zee
Plus if I blow somebody they gon' try to sue me
If rappin was a film I'm starrin in this movie
The Git It Boys hurr, they gon get some boozee?
Lets take it from the club to the ja-cuzzi




(Ay yo) 1 I am the dude that the people call Murph
Check my resume you can see I put in work
Two (two) women that I add to my phone
Three roll ? smoke one when I get home
Four real dirty you and I ??
Those the people I thank, for my damn record sales
Five new broads and one ain't broke
White Porsche truck wood grain like coke
Now everybody in the club lookin spiffy
Mamma got on a dress, boots from the sixties
Oh girl, Shantay tipsy
Kim, Kesha, and Pam all leavin with me
Jackers wanna get me, its not that sipmply
Seventeen fillin up, but you can make it empty
Now which one of ya'll niggas wanna tempt me (now which one of ya'll niggas wanna tempt me)



Everybody in the club gettin tipsy
