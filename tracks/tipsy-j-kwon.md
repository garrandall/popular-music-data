Teen drinking is very bad
Yo, I got a fake ID though
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yo, two step with me, two step with me


One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Everybody drunk out on the dance floor
Baby girl ass jiggle like she want more
Like she a groupie and I ain't even on tour
Maybe 'cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore
Or maybe 'cause she heard that I buy out the stores
Bottom of the ninth and a nigga gotta score
If not I gotta move on to the next whore
Here comes the three to the two to the one
Homeboy trippin', he don't know I got a gun
When it come to pop, man, we do shit for fun
You ain't got one? Nigga, you better run
Now I'm in the back gettin' head from my hun
While she goin' down, I'm braggin' on what I done
She smokin' my blunt sayin' she ain't havin' fun
Bitch, give it back, now you don't get none


Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)


Two, here comes the three to the four to the five
Now I'm lookin' at shorty right in her eyes
Couple seconds pass, now I'm lookin' at her thighs
While she tellin' me how much she hate her guy
Say she got a kid but she got her tubes tied
Girl, you twenty-one? Girl, that's alright
I'm wonderin' if a shake comin' with them fries
If so, baby, can I get 'em super-sized?
Here comes the four to the three to the two
She started feelin' on my Johnson right out the blue
Girl, you super thick so I'm thinkin' that's cool
But instead of one life hat, I need two
Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels
Expression on her face like she ain't got a clue
Then she told me she don't run with the crew
You know how I do but that's just what I gotta do


Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)


Three, here comes the four to the five to the six
Self explanatory, I ain't gotta say I'm rich
Yes, single man, I ain't tryin' to get hitched
Liquor wasted on me, man, son of a bitch
Brushed it-it off, now I'm back to gettin' lit
With some orange juice, man, this some good ish
Homeboy trippin' 'cause I'm starin' at his chick
Now he on the sideline starin' at my clique
Here comes the five to the four to the three
Hands in the air if you cats drunk as me
Club owner said, "Kwon put out those trees!"
Dude, I don't care, I'm a P.I.M.P.


Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)


Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
