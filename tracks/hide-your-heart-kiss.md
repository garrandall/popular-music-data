Johnny saw her riding on a street car named Desire
His fate was sealed
She could see him coming like a hundred other liars
It was no big deal
Rosa had a lover on the shady side of town
Tito, he was king of the streets
She was his possession like a jewel on his crown
Johnny better run, better run


Better hide your heart, better hold on tight
Say your prayers, 'cause there's trouble tonight
When pride and love battle with desire
Better hide your heart, 'cause you're playing with fire


The ride was over but the story doesn't end
He took her heart
She looked him in the eye and said they couldn't meet again
You could see the trouble start
The word went out that Rosa's messin' with someone
It was on the street
Tito looked for Johnny with a vengeance and a gun
Johnny better run, better run



Johnny's holdin' Rosa on a rooftop in the night
As time stood still
They couldn't hear him coming 'til he had them both in sight
You could feel a chill
A shot ran out like thunder and the blood was on her hands
With nothing won
When someone lies dying
Lovers finally understand
