We were on fire
I slashed your tires
It's like we burn so bright, we burn out
I made you chase me
I wasn't that friendly
My love, my drug, we're fucked up, oh


'Cause I've been on the run so long they can't find me
You're waking up to remember I'm pretty
And when the chemicals leave my body
Yeah, they're gonna find me in a hotel lobby 'cause
Mmm, tough
Times they keep comin'
All night
Laughin' and fuckin'
Some days like I'm barely breathin'
After we were high and the love dope died it was you


The pill I keep takin'
The nightmare I wake in
There's nothin', no nothin', nothin' but you
My perfect rock bottom
My beautiful trauma
My love, my love, my drug, oh


My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, (oh) my love, my drug, we're fucked up


You punched a hole in
The wall and I framed it
I wish I could feel things like you
Everyone's chasing
That holy feeling
And if we don't stay lit we'll blow out
Blow out


'Cause we've been on the run so long they can't find us
Who's gonna have to die to remind us
That it feels like we chose this blindly
Now I'm gonna fuck up a hotel lobby
'Cause these tough
Times they keep comin'
Last night
I might have messed it up again
Some days like I'm barely breathin'
But after we were high and the love dope died it was you


The pill I keep takin'
The nightmare I wake in
There's nothin', no nothin', nothin' but you
My perfect rock bottom
My beautiful trauma
My love, my love, my drug, oh


My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
(My drug) my love, my love, my drug, we're fucked up


Mmm tough
Times they keep comin'
All night
Laughin' and fuckin'
Some days like I'm barely breathin'
After we were high and the love dope died it was you


The pill I keep takin'
The nightmare I wake in
There's nothin', no nothin', nothin' but you
My perfect rock bottom
My beautiful trauma
My love, my love, my drug, oh (drug)
