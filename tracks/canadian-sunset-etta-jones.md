Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me
With thrills

A weekend in Canada
A change of scene
Was the most I bargained for

And then I discovered you
And in your eyes
I found the love
That I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never, ever part
