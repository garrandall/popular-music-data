Can't we leave the world outside 
Just for a while? Just for a while? 
Spend some time, you and I 
Under this bright glorious sky 

It's been so long since I first saw you 
But I still love that smile in your eyes 

Yes it's true, right from the start 
I believed in the church of your heart 
Yes it's you, that make me part of 
And I believe in the church of your heart 

Step inside, lay yourself down 
Just for a while, rest for a while 
I can hear a thundering sound 
Beating inside when you're around 

It's been so long since I first met you 
Since we made love, you know how time flies 

Yes it's true, right from the start 
I believed in the church of your heart 
Yes it's you that make me be part of 
And I believe in the church of your heart 
In the church of your heart 

Yes it's true, right from the start 
I believed in the church of your heart 
Yes it's you that make me be part of 
And I believe in the church of your heart 

Pretty baby it's true, right from the start 
I believed in the church of your heart 
Yes it's you that make me be part of 
And I believe in the church of your heart 
In the church of your heart
