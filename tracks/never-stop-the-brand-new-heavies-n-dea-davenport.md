Never stop never giving up
Never stop never giving up
Never stop never giving up

Never stop never giving up
Never stop never giving up
Never stop never giving up

Give it up, feels so good to be together
Spending some time, makin' love
Makin' plans to last forever
Stayin' true until the end

True, there ain't a minute in the the day that's without you
Hoping that you feel it too
What you want? What you're feelin' I am feelin' too?
Never stop never giving up

Never stop never giving up
Never stop never giving up
Never stop never giving up

Evergreen, growin' up but fadin' never
This is what our love became, free at last
Free from all the pain and sorrow
Never feel the hurt again

True, there ain't a minute in the the day that's without you
Hoping that you feel it too
What you want? What you're feelin' I am feelin' too?
Never stop never giving up

True, there ain't a minute in the the day that's without you
Hoping that you feel it too
What you want? What you're feelin' I am feelin' too?
Never stop never giving up

Take your time won't you try love
Not a thing you can buy love
Take your time won't you try love
Not a thing you can buy love

Never stop never giving up
True, there ain't a minute in the the day that's without you
And I'm hoping that you feel it too
What you want? What you're feelin' I am feelin' too?
Never stop never giving up

Oh true baby baby
Never never stop, you never never never never never come
Never stop, never stop
