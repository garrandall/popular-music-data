Back to life, back to reality
Back to life, back to reality
Back to life, back to reality
Back to the here and now, yeah

Show me how decide
What you want from me
Tell me, maybe I could be there for you

How ever do you want me
How ever do you need me
How ever do you want me
How ever do you need me

How ever do you want me
How ever do you need me
How ever do you want me
How ever do you need me

Back to life, back to the present time
Back from a fantasy, yes
Tell me, now, take the initiative
I'll leave it in your hands until you're ready

How ever do you want me
How ever do you need me
How ever do you want me
How ever do you need me

How ever do you want me
How ever do you need me
How ever do you want me
How ever do you need me

How ever do you need me
How ever do you need me
How ever do you need me
How ever do you need me

I live at the top of the block
No more room for trouble and fuss
Need a change, a positive change
Look, it's me writing on the wall

How ever do you want me
How ever do you need me
How ever do you want me
How ever do you need me

How ever do you want me
How ever do you need me
How ever do you want me
How ever do you need me

Back to life, back to the day we have
Let's end this foolish game
Hear me out, don't let it waste away
Make up your mind so I know where I stand

How ever do you want me
How ever do you need me
How ever do you want me
How ever do you need me

How ever do you want me
How ever do you need me
How ever do you want me
How ever do you need me

How ever do you want me
How ever do you need me
How ever do you want me
How ever do you need me

How ever do you want me
How ever do you need me
How ever do you want me
How ever do you need me
