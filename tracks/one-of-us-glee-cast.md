If God had a name, what would it be?
And would you call it to His face?
If you were faced with Him in all His glory
What would you ask if you had just one question?


And yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


What if God was one of us?
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home
Trying to make His way home


If God had a face what would it look like?
And would you want to see?
If seeing meant that you would have to believe
In things like Heaven and in Jesus and the Saints
And all the Prophets


And yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


What if God was one of us?
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home
Trying to make His way home
Back up to Heaven all alone
Nobody callin' on the phone
'Cept for the Pope maybe in Rome


And yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...


What if God was one of us?
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home
Just tryin' to make His way home
Just like a holy rolling stone
Back up to Heaven all alone
Just tryin' to make His way home


Yeah, yeah, God is great


(Nobody callin' on the phone)


Yeah, yeah, God is good


('Cept for the Pope maybe in Rome)


Yeah, yeah, yeah
