It's the best disco in town, number one in disco sound
It's the place where hip people meet, hey, hey
It's the best disco in town, bump and boogie all around
It's no place to sit in your seat, hey, hey
DJ's are the best there, you'll never get a rest there
You may meet the right girl or guy
When they play the right groove your body makes the next move
Get up on the floor and get down to see that the music can take you high

It's the best disco in town, funky music pound for pound
Join the crowd, come on dance and sing, hey, hey
It's the best disco in town, people come from miles around
It's the place to do your own thing, hey, hey

People dress the best there, the music is the best there
They're the very best sounds, so high class
If you make a request the DJ will do his best
To lay down your favorite song so you or baby hold on the past

Oh oh oohohohh,oh, oh oohohohh,oh, oh oohohohohoh

The hit sound of Motown (Oh oh oohohohh,oh, oh oohohohh,oh, oh oohohoh
The hit sound of Motown
I'll be there
â€˜Cause we love music
I love music
Any kind of music
Bad love was good love
The now sounds of Musique
The only way we party is when you got
You got me where you want me
You've got me where you want me
Woo

It's the best disco in town, number one in disco sound
It's the place where hip people meet, hey, hey
It's the best disco in town, bump and boogie all around
It's no place to sit in your seat, hey, hey

DJ's are the best there, you'll never get a rest there
You may meet the right girl or guy
When they play the right groove your body makes the next move
Get up on the floor and get down to see that the music can take you high
Oh that's my baby
I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby
Oh that's the way I like it

Oh oh oohohohh,oh, oh oohohohh,oh, oh oohohohohoh

Bop me, baby, bop me, baby
They call me lady bop, lady bop, it's alright, ah
Here comes the express, the express
Volez vous coo shea a me qua
Volez vous coo shea a me qua

Any time you want me, love
Romantic world
I won't let you down
Give all my love
