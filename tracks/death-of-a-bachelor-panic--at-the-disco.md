Do I look lonely? I see the shadows on my face
People have told me I don't look the same
Maybe I lost weight, I'm playing hooky with the best of the best
Pull my heart out my chest, so that you can see it too


I'm walking the long road, watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress tangles my neck, how do I live?


The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after, whooo, how could I ask for more?
A lifetime of laughter, at the expense of the death of a bachelor


I'm cutting my mind off, feels like my heart is going to burst
Alone at a table for two, and I just wanna be served
And when you think of me, am I the best you've ever had?
Share one more drink with me, smile even though you're sad


I'm walking the long road, watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress tangles my neck, how do I live?


The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after, whooo, how could I ask for more?
A lifetime of laughter at the expense of the death of a bachelor

The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor, o-o-oh! Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after, whooo, how could I ask for more?
A lifetime of laughter at the expense of the death of a bachelor
