We've got stars directing our fate
and we're praying it's not too late
Millennium

Some say that we are players
some say that we are pawns
but we've been making money since the day that we were born
Got to slow down,
cause we'll low down.

Round and round in circles
live a life of solitude
'till we find ourselves a partner someone to relate to
Then we slow down,
before we fall down.
We've got stars directing our fate
and we're praying it's not too late
'cause we know we're falling from grace
Millennium

Live for liposuction
detax for your 'rents
overdose for Christmas and give it up for Lent
My friends are all so cynical refuse to keep the faith
We all enjoy the madness 'cause we know we're gonna fade away.

We've got stars directing our fate
and we're praying it's not too late
'cause we know we're falling from grace
Millennium

Come and have a go if you think you are hard enough
Come and have a go if you think you are hard enough
Millennium
Millennium

We've got stars directing our fate
and we're praying it's not too late
'cause we know we're falling from grace 
Millennium

(Sometimes you know)

And when we come we always come too late
I often think that we were born to hate
get up and see the sarcasm in my eyes.
And when we come we always come too late
I often think that we were born to hate
get up and see the sarcasm in my eyes.

We've got stars directing our fate (Millennium)
and we're praying it's not too late (Millennium)
'cause we know we're falling from grace (Millennium)

(And we won't stop)

We've got stars directing our fate
and we're praying it's not too late 
'cause we know we're falling from grace 
Millennium
