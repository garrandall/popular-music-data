Come a little closer, baby
I feel like layin' you down
On a bed sweet surrender
Where we can work it all out
There ain't nothin' that love can't fix
Girl, it's right here at our fingertips
So come a little closer baby,
I feel like layin' you down

Come a little closer, baby
I feel like lettin' go
Of everything that stands between us
And the love we used to know
I wanna touch you like a cleansing rain
Let it wash all the hurt away
So come a little closer baby
I feel like lettin' go

If there's still a chance
Then take my hand
And we'll steal away
Off into the night
'Til we make things right
The sun's gonna rise on a better day

Come a little closer baby
I feel like strippin' it down
Back to the basics of you and me
And what makes the world go round
Every inch of you against my skin
I wanna be stronger than we've ever been
So come a little closer baby
I feel like strippin' it down

Come a little bit closer baby
Just a little bit closer baby
Come a little bit closer baby
I feel like layin' you down
