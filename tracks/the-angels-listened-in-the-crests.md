The angels listened in, when they heard me praying
The angels listened in, when they heard me saying
"Please send me some one to love
Send the one I'm thinking of."
My darling, the angels sent you

The angels listened in, when they heard me crying
The angels listened in, there's no denying
They sent one with lovely charms
One who really thrills my arms,
My darling, the angels sent you.

I searched everywhere
Just to find someone who cares
They came down to interrupt
Just as I had given up.

The angels listened in and brought you near me
The angels listened in, I love them dearly.
They gave me the whole wide world
Wrapped up in one little girl,
My darling, the angels sent you.
