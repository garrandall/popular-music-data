The gypsy woman told my mother before I was born
I got a boy child who's comin', gonna be a son of a gun
He gonna make pretty women jump and shout
And then the whole world gonna know what this all about

But you know I am, yeah, everybody knows I am
Well, a you know I'm the hoochie coochie man
Yeah, everybody knows I am

I got a black cat bone, I got a mojo too
I got the John 'The Concheroo', gonna mess with you
I'm gonna make you, pretty girl, lead me by the hand
And then the whole world gonna know that I'm the hoochie coochie man

But you know I am, yeah, everybody knows I am
Well, I'm the hoochie coochie man
Yeah, everybody knows I am

On the seventh hours, on the seventh day
On the seventh month, I heard the doctor say
He was born for good luck and that you will see
I got seven hundred dollars, baby, yeah, don't mess with me

But you know I am, well, you know, you know I am
Yeah, I'm the hoochie coochie man
Well, everybody knows I am
