Given any day there's a jet flyin' somewhere
Ah, she bought a ticket and she vanished in the sky
And how was I to know she was leavin' in the mornin'
I never heard her go, she never said goodbye
I learned to love the night, 'cause the light's gonna get ya
Right between the eyes, in the mornin' like a gun
You're reachin' out your hand and she's not there beside ya
Oh, what can I say

Lost her in the sun
What have I done
Lost her in the sun
Lost her in the sun

Ooh, lost her in the sun
Ooh, lost her in the sun
Lost her in the sun
Ah, lost her in the sun

Fire up your hearth for the wind is gettin' cold now
It always gets cold for the riders of the night
You carry that scar when ya know what lonesome is
Lookin' for a home like a bird in flight

And what have I done
Lost her in the sun
Lost her in the sun

Ooh, lost her in the sun
Ooh, lost her in the sun
Ooh, lost her in the sun
Lost her in the sun
Ah, lost her in the sun

Ooh, lost her in the sun
Ooh, lost her in the sun
Ooh, lost her in the sun
Ooh, lost her in the sun
