Oh (Vara Varam)

Baby girl, where you at?
Got no strings, got men attached (Vara Varam)
Can't stop that feelin' for long, no
Mmm (Vara Varam) you makin' dogs wanna beg
Breaking them off your fancy legs (Vara Varam)
But they make you feel right at home, now

See, all these illusions just take us too long
And I want it bad
Because you walk pretty
Because you talk pretty
'Cause you make me sick
And I'm not leavin'
Till you're leavin'

Oh, I swear, there's something when she's pumpin' asking for a raise
Well, does she want me to carry her home, now?
So, does she want me to buy her things?

On my house, on my job
On my loot, shoes, my shirt
My crew, my mind, my father's last name?


When I get you alone
When I get you, you'll know, baby
When I get you alone
When I get you alone (The Warblers: Vara Varam)


(Oh oh) Come on (Oh oh)
Oh yeah-yeah (Vara Varam)
Baby girl, you the shhh
That makes you my equivalent (Vara Varam)
Well, you can keep your toys in the drawer tonight
Alright (Vara Varam)

All my dawgs talkin' fast-
Ain't you got some photographs? (Vara Varam)
'Cause you shook that room like a star, now
Yes you did
Yes you did

All these intrusions just take us too long
And I want you so bad
Because you walk steady
Because you talk steady
'Cause you make me sick
And I'm not leavin', till you're leavin'

So, I pray to something she ain't bluffin'
Rubbin' up on me
Well, does she want me to make a vow?
Check it
Well, does she want me to make it now?

On my house, on my job
On my loot, shoes, my voice
My crew, my mind, my father's last name?


When I get you alone
When I get you, you'll know baby
I get you alone
When I get you alone (Vara Varam)
(Vara Varam Vara Varam Vam Vam Vam Vam Vam) Whoah oh
When I get you alone (Yeeaaahhh; Vara Varam)
