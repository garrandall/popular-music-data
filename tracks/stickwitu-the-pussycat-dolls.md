I don't wanna go another day
So I'm telling you exactly what is on my mind
Seems like everybody's breaking up
And throwing their love away
But I know I got a good thing right here
That's why I say

Nobody gonna love me better
I must stick with you forever
Nobody gonna take me higher
I must stick with you
You know how to appreciate me
I must stick with you, my baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way
I must stick with you

I don't wanna go another day
So I'm telling you exactly what is on my mind
See the way we ride in our private lives
Ain't nobody getting in between
I want you to know that you're the only one for me (one for me)
And I say

Nobody gonna love me better
I must stick with you forever
Nobody gonna take me higher
I must stick with you
You know how to appreciate me
I must stick with you, my baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way
I must stick with you

And now
Ain't nothing else I can need (nothing else I can need)
And now
I'm singing 'cause you're so, so into me
I got you
We'll be making love endlessly
I'm with you (baby, I'm with you)
Baby, you're with me (baby, you're with me)

So don't you worry about
People hanging around
They ain't bringing us down
I know you and you know me
And that's all that counts

So don't you worry about
People hanging around
They ain't bringing us down
I know you and you know me
And that's, that's why I say

Nobody gonna love me better
I must stick with you forever
Nobody gonna take me higher
I must stick with you
You know how to appreciate me
I must stick with you, my baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way
I must stick with you

Nobody gonna love me better
I must stick with you forever
Nobody gonna take me higher
I must stick with you
You know how to appreciate me
I must stick with you, my baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way
I must stick with you
