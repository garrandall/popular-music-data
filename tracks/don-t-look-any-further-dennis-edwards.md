Whoa, oh, well, well, well, well, well
Ooh, hmmmm

Someone to count on
In a world ever changing
Here I am, stop where you're standin'

What you need is a lover
A man to take over
Oh girl, don't look any further

Strange, when you think of the chances
That we'd both be in a state of mind
Too cool to be careless
Lookin' for the right thing
Oh baby, don't look any further

(Tonight)
Tonight, we're gonna taste a little paradise
Rock you all night long, baby
All night long
Daylight (Daylight)
I'll still be lookin' in your ebony eyes
And we'll go on and on and on

Day-o day-o, mombajee ai-o, well
Don't look any further
Day-o day-o, mombajee ai-o, well
Don't look any further

Someone to count on
In a world ever changing
Here I am, stop where you're standin'

What you need is a lover
You need a lover
To love you all over
Love me all over
Oh baby, don't you look any further, further

Don't look any further
Don't look any further

Tonight
Tonight, we're gonna taste a little, paradise
Rock you all night long
Rock you all night long
Daylight
Daylight
I'll still be lookin' in your ebony eyes
And we'll go on and on and on

Day-o day-o, mombajee ai-o, say it
Don't look any further
Day-o day-o, mombajee ai-o, well
Don't look any further, don't you ever look

Day-o day-o, mombajee ai-o,
Don't look any further, further
Day-o day-o, mombajee ai-o,
Don't look any further, further

Day-o day-o, mombajee ai-o,
Don't look any further
