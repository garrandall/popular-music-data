Aye
Aye Draco, aye come here
Yeah
Aye reach me that cup slime
Draco, sit right there
Let's go
What up?
Aye, I pulled up two doors up
Huh
Fuck you don't like me, ya namsayin, what it is?
What? You want smoke or sum bitch?!

Thank God, I got my own now
Feel that I'm not wrong now
Tryna find my soul now
I can go to shows now
Got me a new pole now
Got me a new hoe now
'Bout to cop that Rolls now
Living on my own now
Turned up, I won't turn down
Happy in my songs now
Bitch you better not test me, you excited that I'm gone now
Bought moms a new home now
Bought Draco a new bust down
My judge say she happy, Iâm on track so Iâm not wrong now

But I'm still reminiscing bout my old lady
Sleeping on my own baby, notice that I'm strong baby
Strapped up with that chrome baby
Money on my dome baby, and I came a long way
Drugs got me gone, baby
I'm happy with my money, baby
Fuck if they think that I'm outdated
Drona say she hate I'm fakin
Keke wanna have my baby
Bitch I'm caught up in this flexing
Kill that boy, he talkinâ reckless
They donât like how I been rappin'
Bet they bump my shit in Texas
Stop and pray that my heart have not gone different places
I been all alone for the last year baby
Ima die before this Christmas, I ainât scared Ima face it
Give a fuck bout where you at and who you with, bitch I done made it

Thank God, I got my own now
Feel that I'm not wrong now
Tryna find my soul now
I can go to shows now
Got me a new pole now
I don't need no hoe now
'Bout to cop that Rolls now
Living on my own now
Turned up, I won't turn down
Happy in my songs now
Bitch you better not test me, you excited that I'm gone now
Bought Moms a new home
Bought Draco a new bust down
My judge say she happy, I'm on track so I'm not wrong now

Lamborghini wit' the doors up
Money got a nigga frozed up
North side, Ima throw it up
Big house wit' a hot tub
Ran it up, got a million plus
G-Wagon, gave it to my thug
.40 Glock, Ima keep it tucked
On Live, he ain't see 'em runnin' up
Livin' in the better days now
Red gate on the tape now
Three sons, one on the way
Don't fuck wit' them, so I'm fake now
Gold plated, brand new K now
Shoot a nigga in the face now
300k on a ring now
Tryna overdose off lean now

Thank God, I got my own now
Feel that I'm not wrong now
Tryna find my soul now
I can go to shows now
Got me a new pole now
Got me a new hoe now
'Bout to cop that Rolls now
Living on my own now
Turned up, I won't turn down
Happy in my songs now
Bitch you better not test me, you excited that I'm gone now
Bought Moms a new home
Bought Draco a new bust down
My judge say she happy, I'm on track so I'm not wrong now
And I got my own now
Feel that I'm not wrong now
Tryna find my soul now
I can go to shows now
Got me a new pole now
Got me a new hoe now
'Bout to cop that Rolls now
Living on my own now
Turned up, I won't turn down
Happy in my songs now
Bitch you better not test me, you excited that I'm gone now
Bought Moms a new home
Bought Draco a new bust down
My judge say she happy, I'm on track so I'm not wrong now
