The lights In the harbour
Don't shine for me
Oh, I'm like a lost ship adrift on the sea

A sea of heartbreak
Lost love and loneliness
Memories of your caress
So divine, how I wish, you were mine
Again my dear
I am on a sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak

How did I lose you
Where did I fail
Oh, why did you leave me
Always to sail
Oh what I'd give to sail back to shore
Back to your arms once more
Come to my rescue
Come here to me
Take me and keep me
Away from the sea

This sea of heartbreak
Lost love and loneliness
The memories of your caress
So divine, how I wish you were mine
Again my dear
I am on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak

This Sea of heartbreak
Lost love and loneliness
The memories of your caress
So divine how I wish you were mine
Again my dear
I am on a sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak
