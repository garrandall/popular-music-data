The lights in the harbor
Don't shine for me
I'm like a lost ship
Adrift on the sea

Yeah, the sea of heartbreak
Lost love and loneliness
Memories of your caress so divine
How I wish you were mine

Again my dear
I'm on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak

Oh, how did I lose you
Oh, where did I fail
Why did you leave me
Always to sail

Yeah, the sea of heartbreak
Lost love and loneliness
Memories of your caress so divine
How I wish you were mine

Again my dear
I'm on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak

Oh, what I'd give just to sail back to shore
Back to your arms once more

Oh, come to my rescue
Come here to me
Take me and keep me
Away from the sea

Yeah, the sea of heartbreak
Lost love and loneliness
Memories of your caress so divine
How I wish you were mine

Again my dear
I'm on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak

(Sea of heartbreak)
Yeah, sea of heartbreak
(Sea of heartbreak)
Heartbreak
