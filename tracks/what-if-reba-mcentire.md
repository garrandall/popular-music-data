Sometimes I don't understand
Feels like I'm living in a world gone mad
Look around, all around it's just the same
People just rush everywhere
No time to ever take the time to care
We're the ones
We're the losers in this game
So where is the tenderness we scarifice for progress
And where is the love we need
You know it makes me wonder

What if everybody, what if everybody reached out with just one hand (reached with just one hand)
What if everybody, what if everybody sang out with just one voice (sang with just one voice)
Maybe we could change things
What if everybody, what if everybody cared with just one heart (cared with their own heart)
What if everybody, what if everybody tried to light one spark (tried to light one spark)
Maybe we could change things somehow

Somehow it's all up to us
Gotta take this world, make it a world of love
Gotta do it now
Gotta find a way to make a change somehow
There's gotta be a way for us to make it better

What if everybody, what if everybody reached out with just one hand (reached with just one hand)
What if everybody, what if everybody sang out with just one voice (sang with just one voice)
Maybe we could change things
What if everybody, what if everybody cared with just one heart (cared with their own heart)
What if everybody, what if everybody tried to light one spark (tried to light one spark)
Maybe we could change things somehow

Here in our hearts
Oh the answer is there
If we only would look inside them
We can make it better, we can make it better... If we try together

What if everybody, what if everybody reached out with just one hand (reached with just one hand)
What if everybody, what if everybody sang out with just one voice (sang with just one voice)
Maybe we could change things
What if everybody, what if everybody cared with just one heart (cared with their own heart)
What if everybody, what if everybody tried to light one spark (tried to light one spark)
Maybe we could change things somehow
