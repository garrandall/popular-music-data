Darlin' if you want me to be closer to you, get closer to me
Darlin' if you want me to be closer to you, get closer to me
Darlin' if you want me to love, love only you, then love only me
Darlin' if you want me to see, see only you, then see only me

There's a line, I can't cross over
It's no good for me and it's no good for you

And there's a feelin', deep down inside me
I can't explain it and you're wondering why
You say we've been like strangers
But I'm not the others you can wrap 'round your fingers

Darlin' if you want me to be closer to you, get closer to me
Darlin' if you want me to be closer to you, get closer to me
Darlin' if you want me to love, love only you, then love only me
Darlin' if you want me to see, see only you, then see only me

There was a time, when I would come runnin'
I'd drop everything for the touch of your hand in mine

You were blind
And now you regret it
'Cause I can't forget it
It's locked in my mind
And I can't go on livin'

Day to day
Wondering if we'll be here tomorrow
People change and you're changin'
And I've given you my all
There's no more to borrow

Darlin' if you want me to be closer to you, get closer to me
Darlin' if you want me to be closer to you, get closer to me
Darlin' if you want me to love, love only you, then love only me
Darlin' if you want me to see, see only you, then see only me
