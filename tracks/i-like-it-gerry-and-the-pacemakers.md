I like it, I like it
I like the way you run your fingers through my hair
And I love the way you tickle my chin
And I like the way you let me come in when your momma ain't there

I like it, I like it
I like the words you say and all the things you do
And I like the way you straighten my tie
And I like the way you're winking your eye
And I know I like you
You know I like you

Do that again
You're driving me insane
Kiss me once more
That's another thing I like you for

I like it, I like it
I like the funny feeling being here with you
And I like it more with every day
And I like it always hearing you say you're liking it too
You're liking it too

I'm asking you
What do you wanna do?
Do you agree
That the world was made for you and me?

I like it, I like it
I like the funny feeling being here with you
And I like it more with every day
And I like it always hearing you say you're liking it too
You're liking it too

Whoa-oh I like it
Are you liking it too?
