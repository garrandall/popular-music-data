Never thought this would happen
Gonna let it sink in, you're gone
Don't know, know what I'm feeling
I must be dreaming, you're gone

Suitcase, band-aids
Pulling back out the driveway
You go, I'll stay
You can keep all the memories
I thought I was the best thing that ever happened to you
I thought you loved me the most

I don't know why I cry
But I think it's 'cause I remembered for the first time
Since I hated you
That I used to love you
I don't know why I cry
But I think it's 'cause I remembered for the first time
Since I hated you
That I used to love you

Oh, oh, oh, oh
I used to love you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I used to love you

You thought
There were no boundaries
What, you just pushed me too far
I guess nobody taught you
Nobody taught you how to love

Suitcase, band-aids
Pulling back out the driveway
You go, I'll stay
You can keep all the memories
I thought I was the best thing that ever happened to you
I thought you loved me the most

I don't know why I cry
But I think it's 'cause I remembered for the first time
Since I hated you
That I used to love you
I don't know why I cry
But I think it's 'cause I remembered for the first time
Since I hated you
That I used to love you

Oh, oh, oh, oh
I used to love you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I used to love you

You know I was the best thing that ever happened to you
Well, now look at what you lost, oh
You know I was the best thing that ever happened to you
Now look at what you lost, oh

I don't know why I cry
But I think it's 'cause I remembered for the first time
Since I hated you
That I used to love you
I don't know why I cry
But I think it's 'cause I remembered for the first time
Since I hated you
That I used to love you

Oh, oh, oh, oh
I used to love you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I used to love you

I don't know why I cry
I don't, I don't, I don't
I don't know why I used to love you
I don't, I don't, I don't
I don't know why I cry
I don't, I don't, I don't
I don't know why I used to love you
I don't, I don't, I don't
