Someday, some way
You'll realize that
You've been blind
Yes, darling, you're
Going to need me again
It's just a matter of time
Go on, go on
Until you reach
The end of the line
But I know you'll
Pass my way again
It's just a matter of time
After I gave you
Everything I had
You laughed and
Called me a clown
Remember, in your search
For fortune and fame
What goes up must come down
I know, I know that one day
You'll wake up and find
That my love was a true love
It's just a matter of time
