Oo, you say you're feeling bad cause
The least thing makes you cry
Sounds like a real bad case
Of a girl who needs a guy
I think I know the perfect jewel
One you ought to try
Take a heart that's full of love
On this you can rely


If you need some quick reaction, take this heart of mine
And if you need some satisfaction, take this heart of mine
And if you're tired of being lonely, take this heart of mine
I think I can help you if you'll only take this heart of mine


I may not be a doctor who can cure your ills
Goodbye to all those different drugs and hard-swallowed pills
My remedy is older than the tale of Jack and Jill
My prescription is the kind you love to have refilled




Oh, medicine won't cure you
Just leave you at the most
The relief is only temporary
Pretty soon will go
But love can last a lifetime
When two hearts are close
Take as much as you want to
There is no overdose
