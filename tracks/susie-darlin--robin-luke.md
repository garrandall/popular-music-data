I stood a-watchin' all night long
I stood a-watchin' all night long
I stood a-watchin' till you went away
You were a girl of many charms
Oh, how I loved you in my arms
I never thought that you would ever go
Because I loved you so
Oh-uh, Susie darlin'
I thought you knew
You were all the world to me
All my dreams come true
I stood a-cryin' all night long
I stood a-cryin' all night long
Cryin' and wishin' you'd come back to me-ee
Thinking of all the dreams we knew
Now that you're gone they won't come true
My heart is empty without you
Nothin' there but misery
Oh-uh, Susie darlin'
I thought you knew
You were all the world to me
All my dreams come true
Now-ow I stand a-watchin' all night long
I stand a-watchin' all night long
Knowing that life has nothing left for me-ee
I'll wait around most patiently
Hopin' you will return to me
'Til that happy day I will always be
Watchin' all night long
Oh-uh, Susie darlin'
I thought you knew
You were all the world to me
All my dreams come true
