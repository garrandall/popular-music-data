All of your life you hold out for love
You give what you have still that's not enough
What went wrong
'Cause now what we share are too many fears
Too many secrets and too many years
Tonight

Tell me what you dream at night while you're sleeping
Tell me what you see at night in your dreams
Is it someone else's arms that hold you tight
Or darling is it me
Tell me what you dream at night while you sleep

Deep in the night, you whisper so low
I lay by your side I felt so alone, alone
I reach for your arms, you call out a name
It wasn't my own that caused me such pain inside

Tell me what you dream at night while you're sleeping
Tell me what you see at night in your dreams
Is it someone else's arms that hold you tight
Or darling is it me
Tell me what you dream at night while you sleep

Tell me what you dream at night while you're sleeping
Tell me what you see at night in your dreams
Is it someone else's arms that hold you tight
Or darling is it me
Tell me what you dream at night while you sleep

Tell me what you dream at night
Dream at night
Oh baby dream at night, while you're sleeping
