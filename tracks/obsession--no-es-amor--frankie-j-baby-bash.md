(Check check ...this happened for real ...baby bash..yo.. Frankie j.... obsession)

Well it's early in the morning
And my heart is feeling lonely
Just thinkin bout you baby
Got me twisted in the head
And I don't know how to take it
But it's driving me so crazy
I don't know if it's right
I'm tossing turning in my bed
It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinkin bout your beauty it makes me
weep...
I'm feeling hopeless in my home
I don't know what to do I think I'm in love
Baby...


Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling (what am I doing wrong)
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?

Now I know you're not my lady but I'm just trying to make this right
I don't know what to do I'm going out of my mind
So baby if u let me could I get you to say maybe we could ride together
We could do this all night now I don't care if u got a man
Baby I wish you'd understand
Cause I know he can't love u right, quite like I can
It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinkin bout your beauty it makes me
weep...
I'm feeling hopeless at home
I don't know what to do I think I'm in love


Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling? (what am I doing wrong)
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?

I love the way u freaky like that
I love the way u freaky like that
I love the way u freaky like that
It's an obsession


Hold up let me dream
Shorty got me feeling serene
Where my candy, where my cream
Got your boy feeling supreme
Hold up wait a minute baby you so damn independent
Loving everything your representing
Got a lot of money, I love to spend it
And that's whats up and I don't care what people scream
You're my blessing when I'm stressing
My superfly beauty queen
I'm gonna keep it saucy
Cause my money know how I do, we go rendez-vous, mi corazon belongs to you


Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling? (what am I doing wrong) what am I do wrong 
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
What am I feeling? (what am I doing wrong?) what am I do so wrong? 
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?

Amor
