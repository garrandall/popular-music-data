Gypsies danced around the campfire, shook their tambourines 
They were waiting for the ghost of an outlaw, Sundown was his name 
As the midnight hour grew closer and the sky began to fall 
You can see his shadow in the light of the moon 
They had heard the gypsies' call 

She had hair as black as darkness, eyes of emerald green 
Oh, her voice was soft and tender, oooh she loved sing 
She will sing no more, or dance again or shake her tambourines 
They had taken her away, she was dead and gone, hear the gypsies sing 

Ooh, hurry Sundown (the gypsies' cry)
Ooh, hurry Sundown
Ooh, hurry Sundown (the gypsies' cry)
Hurry Sundown

Ooh, hurry Sundown (the gypsies' cry)
Ooh, hurry Sundown
Ooh, hurry Sundown (the gypsies' cry)

Silver devils in his holsters, stars strapped to his heels 
There was fire in his eyes, they say that he was dressed to kill 
He had hands as fast as lightning, a heart as cold as steel 
He had come for the one that took her life, to lie him in Boot Hill 

Gypsies danced around the campfire, shook their tambourines 
They were waiting for the ghost of an outlaw, Sundown was his name 
As the midnight hour grew closer and the sky began to fall 
You can see their shadows in the light of the moon 
They had heard the gypsies' call 

Ooh, hurry Sundown
Ooh, hurry Sundown
Ooh, hurry Sundown
Ooh, hurry Sundown
