She don't laugh at everything
But when she does the planets swing
Around her
She don't step on sidewalk seams
Her teenage boyfriends all still dream
About her

She don't need the glitter of the Vegas lights
She could blow a kiss and leave you spinning like
A Tilt-A-Whirl

I met a girl
She made me smile
She made me wait
She crossed the street
She crossed my heart
She fixed her dress
She bit her lip
She lit me up

I met a girl
With crazy shoes
And baby blues
The way she moves
Is changing my whole world
I met a girl

The sunshine waits for her to wake up
She's a ponytail, no make-up,
Saturday 
'Cause she don't need umbrellas in a summer rain
She could catch the eye of a hurricane
In blue jean pearls

I met a girl
She made me smile
She made me wait
She crossed the street
She crossed my heart
She fixed her dress
She bit her lip
She lit me up

I met a girl
With crazy shoes
And baby blues
The way she moves
Is changing my whole world

She turned around
And it felt like the world turned upside down
And the only thing that I could say was "Hey"
And I'm so glad she didn't walk away

She dances like nobody sees her
Can't believe I get to be here in her world

I met a girl
She made me smile
She made me wait
She crossed the street
She crossed my heart
She fixed her dress
She bit her lip
She lit me up

I met a girl
With crazy shoes
And baby blues
The way she moves
Is changing my whole world
I met a girl
I met a girl
