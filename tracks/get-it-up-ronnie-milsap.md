Been preparin'
All week long
To get it ready
To get it on

The only thing
That's on my mind
Is drivin' it home
In 4-4 time

1, 2, 3, 4...


You gotta get it up
Get down
Get it on
Or get on out

That's the only way
To make my baby shout

You gotta get it up
Get down
Get it on
Or get on out

You gotta get it up
Get down
Get it on
Or get on out


This is what she said to me
The only way you can set me free
Is show me every move you got
And move it till it hits the spot

5, 6, 7, 8...


Yeah...
Get it on, white boy


Get it up
Get down
Get it on
Or get on out


 3x



The second verse now

This is what she said to me
The only way you can set me free
Is show me every move you got
And move it till it hits the spot


 4x



Let's give it to Warren...
Ah you're cookin' now
You're cookin' Warren

Do it to me...
Do it to me...
Go on, do it to me...


 4x

Go on, give it to me ya'll
You know I can sit here
And do this thing all night long...
