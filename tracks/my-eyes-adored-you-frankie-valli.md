My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me
You couldn't see how I adored you
So close, so close and yet so far away

Carried your books from school
Playing make-believe you're married to me
You were fifth grade, I was sixth
When we came to be

Walking home every day
Over Barnegat Bridge and Bay
Till we grew into the me and you
Who went our separate ways

My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me
You couldn't see how I adored you
So close, so close and yet so far

Headed for city lights
Climbed the ladder up to fortune and fame
I worked my fingers to the bone
Made myself a name

Funny, I seem to find
That no matter how the years unwind
Still I reminisce about the girl I miss
And the love I left behind

My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me
You couldn't see how I adored you
So close, so close and yet so far

All my life I will remember
How warm and tender
We were way back then
Though I'm feeling sad regrets
I know I won't ever forget you, my childhood friend

'My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me
You couldn't see how I adored you
So close, so close and yet so far

My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
