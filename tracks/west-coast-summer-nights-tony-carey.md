Oh, that summer was a killer, all right
Sleeping in the back of the car at night
We had no money, we came through
You had me, baby, I had you

Out on the open road all over America
Had it made, we were getting it right
Making love on a West Coast summer night

(Summer night, summer night)
Summer night (summer night)
Summer night (summer night)

We had it made and we knew it all
We could never stumble
Never take a fall
We had the world at our fingertips
We were golden, we couldn't miss

Out on the open road all over America
Had it made, we were getting it right
Making love on a West Coast summer night

(Summer night, summer night)
Summer night (summer night)
Summer night (summer night)

Out on the open road all over America
Had it made, we were getting it right
Making love on a West Coast summer night

(Summer night, summer night)
(Summer night, summer night)

Whatever became of the summer of love
Did we get hard or did we grow up
Had it made, we were getting it right
Making love on a West Coast summer night

(Summer night, summer night)
(Summer night) we were making love
On a west coast summer night

(Summer night)
Summer night (summer night)
West Coast summer night
(Summer night)

We were making love
On a West Coast summer night
