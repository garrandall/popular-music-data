Lets love
While the night is young
Lets love
Life has just begun
A dream of reality

Lets love
Press your lips to mine
Lets kiss
For that thrill divine
While we realize
There's no one but you and me

I find your arms so inviting to me
So what am I to do
The thrill of your touch is sp exciting to me
While our hearts are reeling while we have this feeling

Lets love
Till the end of time
Lets love
Leave the world behind
Now that we have found the wonderful glory of
Two magic words
Lets love

Lets love
Lets love
Life has just begun
A dream of reality

Lets love
Let's kiss for that thrill divine
As we realize
There is no one but you and me

I find your arms so inviting to me
So what am I to do
The thrill of your touch is so exciting to me
While our hearts are reeling while we have this feeling

Lets love
Till the end of time
Lets love
Leave the world behind
Now that we have found the wonderful glory of
Two magic words
Lets love

Lets love

Lets Love
