Ah send you my love
With a dozen roses
Make sure that you knows it's
From the bottom of my heart
Ah way we say
Ah send you my love
Don't hold back your feelings
There's so many reasons
Why we shouldn't be apart
Ah way we say
For all o' y'all though we livin' in hell
Come ketch di vibes as B.J's excel
'Pon a musical selection with a slight rendition
Of a wonder if will make ya all reminisce
Go to places what ya feeling, yeah, yeah
Dancehall is just revealing, yeah, yeah
The very essence of life will make your whole future bright
And no Kris neither Kross but tonight ah di night
Me just
Send me your love, baby
An undying love, sugar
Break di shackles from off my feet
And it goes a little something like this, again, again
Send me your love, baby
An undying love, lady
Break di shackles from off my feet
And it goes a little something like this
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-a
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Me say
De girls dem nowadays, all dem really want
Expensive jewl-a-ries and fancy cars
Nuff Dona Karan and now a crisp Benz Sedan
Mr. Quality ah dem perfect man but hear di plan

Just say you love me, you think you know me
And you don't wanna go-away
So honey just draw near and just hug me
