Uh oh uh oh uh oh uh oh
Honestly if I tell, tell you what what you want to know love
There ain't another don't want no other lover
I put nothing above ya I kick them to the gutter
They try to shake me and they're call'n me crazy now
Look at us lately and tell'em whose your lady

I never thought you'd be the one
Make me shine brighter than the sun
There ain't no ups and downs
No win and now to hear right now

If you want me to stay I'll never leave
If you want me to stay we'll always be
If you want me to stay love endlessly
If you want me to stay
If you want me to stay I'll never leave you

Uh oh uh oh uh oh uh oh
Now all you're lovin' back we're happy it's a fact
Can nothing hold us back we got this in the bag
They're ain't no babies no question love you daily now
Look at us lately and tell 'em whose your lady

I never thought you'd be the one
Make me shine brighter than the sun
There ain't no ups and downs
No win and now to hear right now

If you want me to stay I'll never leave
If you want me to stay we'll always be
If you want me to stay love endlessly
If you want me to stay
If you want me to stay I'll never leave you

Uh oh uh oh uh oh uh oh
Uh oh uh oh uh oh uh oh
