Gimme a token, I wanna get open
Pour me a Coke and rum and then some
I ain't joking, I need to get open
So I'm-a need more than just one

I've just begun
I feel the buzz and rush, man
And I got the touch like

I'm super, never blooper
Blunder, rough like thunder
Got the hunger, I feel the hunger
All I wants is get up under

And you surrender, love me tender
Won't ever leave me drunk and lonely
So take my keys and drop me home
And work me to the bom bom bom

Hey, yo, D (what up, dude)
Let me get open on this groove
'Cause I be the lifted one
Gifted one with the gifted tongue
Enlisted on this

A groove that'll make you fly
A groove that'll get you high
A groove that'll make you
Weak in the knees like a forty ouncer
Say, ai, ai, ai, ai

'Cause drinking sure will incite you
Really light you up, give a crazy rush
So do what you came to do (what's that)

(Drunk) I like to dance when I'm
(Drunk) yes, I romance when I'm
(Drunk) I like to dance when I'm
(Drunk, don't play the punk)

(Drunk) I like to dance when I'm
(Drunk) yes, I romance when I'm
(Drunk) I like to dance when I'm
(Drunk, don't play the punk)

Oh, baby, oh, baby
Oh, baby, oh, baby...

Gotta, gotta, gotta...
Gotta have you, have you...

Let me drink my drink and get funky
Till you speak, speak if you want me
Catch me by the bar getting numbers
Off some honeys hotter than summer

Honeys hot enough that they sizzle
Making jimmy harder than missiles
Making jimmy wanna go bang
Baby, shake that thang

'Cause you can't do
What I can do for you
So get on the floor
'Cause I won't bore you

Pass a drink and let my
Rock sink inside the mass
Just shake your ass
Pump your fist like this
And if you're hip
Well, then raise your glasses
Come on

(Drunk) I like to dance when I'm
(Drunk) yes, I romance when I'm
(Drunk) I like to dance when I'm
(Drunk, don't play the punk)

(Drunk) I like to dance when I'm
(Drunk) yes, I romance when I'm
(Drunk) I like to dance when I'm
(Drunk, don't play the punk)
