Body, body, body, everybody
Body, body, body, everybody
Body, body, body, everybody
Body, body, body, everybody

Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap you hands
(Come on, come on)

Music never lets you down
Puts a smile on your face
Any time, anyplace
Dancing helps relieve the pain
Soothes your mind, makes you happy again
Listen to those dancing feet
Close your eyes and let go
But it don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing
Bop-shoo-wa, bop-shoo-wa, bop-shoo-wa

Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap you hands
(Come on, come on dance with me)
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands
(Come on, come on)
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap you hands
Come on, come on)

Spinning all around the floor
Just like Rogers and Astaire
Hoof all night without a care
Stepping to our favorite tune
The good times always end too soon
Everybody's dancing
Lift your feet, have some fun
Come on everybody, get on your feet
Clap your hands
Everybody's screaming

Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap you hands
(Come on, come on dance with me)
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands
(Come on, come on)
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap you hands
(Come on, come on)

Let me see you 
Do you want to dance, baby

Body, body, body, everybody
Body, body, body, everybody
Body, body, body, everybody
Body, body, body, everybody

Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap you hands
(Come on, come on dance with me)
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands
(Come on, come on)
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap you hands
(Come on, come on)

Everybody dance
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Everybody dance
Clap your hands, clap your hands
