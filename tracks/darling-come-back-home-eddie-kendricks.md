This is a heart
That used to feel the joy of waking
I was thankful for each flower every tree
These are eyes that used to see each new day breakin'
and believe it was a gift from God to me

I have felt these things inside, with you by my side
Since you've gone and left me, everything beautiful has died

Come back home
Oh baby, come back home
Everything that I've been living for is gone, is gone
Darling, won't you come back home
I don't know, I don't know

What I did to make you leave, girl
I've relived every moment
Every single word I've said
If you love someone more than me, he's a thief
He's taken happiness, left me emptiness instead

Come back home
Oh baby, come back home
Everything that I've been living for is gone, is gone
Darling won't you come back home
I don't know what I'm gonna do

Come back
Come back

Hey hey
I'm no poet, no philosopher of logic
I can hardly make my feelings conversation
Oh no... cause you control my thoughts and my body
The pain, the pain of losin' you makes even livin' hard to do

Come back home
Oh baby, come back home
Everything that I've been living for is gone, is gone
Darling won't you come back home
I don't know what I'm gonna do
...
