All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dreams
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for love


Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone


It's real love
It's real
Yes, it's real love
It's real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love


Don't need to be afraid
No need to be afraid


It's real love
It's real
Yes, it's real love
It's real

Thought I'd been in love before
But in my heart, I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you


Don't need to be alone
Don't need to be alone


It's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real

Yes it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
