Nothing so loud
As hearing when we lie
Truth is not kind
And you've said neither am I
And the air outside so soft is saying everything
Everything


All I want is to feel this way
To be this close, to feel the same
All I want is to feel this way
The evening speaks, I feel it say


Nothing's so cold
As closing the heart when all we need
Is to free the soul
But we wouldn't be that brave I know
And the air outside so soft, confessing everything
Everything


All I want is to feel this way
To be this close, to feel the same
All I want is to feel this way
The evening speaks, I feel it say


And it won't matter now
Whatever happens will be
Though the air speaks of all we'll never be
It won't trouble me


All I want is to feel this way
To be this close, to feel the same
All I want is to feel this way
The evening speaks, I feel it say
All I want is to feel this way (And it feels so close)
To be this close, to feel the same (Let it take me in)
All I want is to feel this way (Let it hold me so)
The evening speaks, I feel it say (I can feel it say)
