Time has a desperate way of passing
Even more the thoughts of what's gone by
And there's just no need in asking
Who really knows the reason why
Maybe you're having trouble loving
Your mate can't relate to your tune
You tried to piece it all together
You almost had it, but he left too soon

Just when you think you got things just about licked
Got thing about under control
Up pops that mean old devil with his bag of tricks
Messing up your mind and tearing out your soul

All things happen for a reason
Nothing beats a failure but a try
And as sure as the changing of the seasons
You're gonna live you life before you die

You're gonna live your life
You're gonna live your life
Hey you're gonna live your life before you die

Just when you think you got things just about licked
Got thing about under control
Up pops that mean old devil with his bag of tricks
Messing up your mind and tearing out your soul

All things happen for a reason
God only knows the reason why
And as sure as the changing of the seasons
You're gonna live you life before you die

You're gonna live your life
You're gonna live your life
Hey you're gonna live your life before you die

Before you die' before you die
Before you die' before you die
Before you die' before you die
Before you die, before you die
Before you die, before you die
Before you die' before you die
