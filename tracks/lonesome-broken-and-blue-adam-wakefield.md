"Lovin' you is like staring into the sun
The more I try
The faster the tears will run
Never been burned so bad by anyone
Lovin' you is like staring into the sun

Lonesome, broken, and blue
Is how you left this heart that loved you so true
Might've broke it soft and slow
(Now all that's left feeds the crows)
I've been holding on
But honey I'm just too
Lonesome, broken, and blue

Lettin' go is like putting hot iron to the wound
It hurts like hell
But it's something you gotta do
It's hard to believe a hurt like this
Could be good for you
Lettin' go is like putting hot iron to the wound

Lonesome, broken, and blue
Is how you left this heart that loved you so true
Might've broke it soft and slow
(Now all that's left feeds the crows)
I've been holding on, but honey
Holding on, but honey
I've been holding on
But honey I'm just too
Lonesome, broken, and blue"
