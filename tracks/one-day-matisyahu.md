Ooo-ahoo, ah-yah-ahha
Am-aba-ah-ah-oh-oh
(One day, one day, one day)
Am-ah-ah-ah-oh-oh


Sometimes I lay under the moon and thank God I'm breathing
Then I pray, "Don't take me soon, 'cause I am here for a reason"


Sometimes in my tears I drown
But I never let it get me down
So when negativity surrounds
I know some day it'll all turn around, because...


All my life I've been waiting for, I've been praying for
For the people to say
That we don't wanna fight no more, there'll be no more wars
And our children will play
One day (One day), one day (One day), one day (Oh-oh-oh)
One day (One day), one day (One day), one day (Oh-oh-oh)


It's not about win or lose, 'cause we all lose when they feed
On the souls of the innocent, blood-drenched pavement
Keep on moving though the waters stay raging
In this maze, you can lose your way (Your way)
It might drive you crazy, but don't let it phase you, no way (No way)


Sometimes in my tears I drown (I drown)
But I never let it get me down (Get me dow-own)
So when negativity surrounds (Surrounds)
I know some day it'll all turn around, because...


All my life I've been waiting for (Waiting for)
I've been praying for (Praying for)
For the people to say
That we don't wanna fight no more (Fight no more)
They'll be no more war (No more war)
And our children will play
One day (One day), one day (One day), one day (Oh-oh-oh, one day)
One day (One day), one day (One day), one day (Oh-oh-oh)


One day this all will change, treat people the same
Stop with the violence, down with the hate
One day we'll all be free, and proud to be
Under the same sun, singing songs of freedom like:
Why-oh , why-oh-oh-oh
(One day, one day, oh-oh-oh)
Why-oh, why-oh-oh-oh
(One day, one day, oh-oh-oh)


All my life I've been waiting for
I've been praying for
For the people to say (Ay-yay-yay-yay-yay-oh)
That we don't wanna fight no more (Ay-yay-yay-yay-yay-oh)
They'll be no more war
And our children will play
(Why-oh , why-oh-oh-oh)
One day (One day), one day (One day), one day (Oh-oh-oh)
(Why-oh , why-oh-oh-oh)
One day (One day), one day (One day), one day (Oh-oh-oh)


Ooo-ahoo, ah-yah-ahha
Am-aba-ah-ah-oh-oh
(One day, one day, one day)
Am-ah-ah-ah-oh-oh
