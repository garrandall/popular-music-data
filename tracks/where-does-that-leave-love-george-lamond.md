Magic fills the air whenever you are near
I can finally see the mystery of love in your eyes
Its got me hypnotized
It made me believe our love was meant to be
Now some things have changed
You're mentioning his name
But I don't want to hear
That you've let someone new into heart
It's tearing me apart
But darling I've just got to know

Chorus:
Where does that leave love
Where does that leave us
What about the promises and dreams that mean so much
Where does that leave me
Living without you
How can I go on when you are telling me we're through
Darling if its true
Where does that leave us
Where does that leave love

Holding back the tears
Holding back the fears
That you would really go
And leave me here to live all alone
No meaning in my life
Now all that is left is a dream that's half alive
I still need you so
I just can't let you go
Can't you find in me
What you have found in somebody new
After all that we've been through
If I am about to lose you

Chorus
Where does that leave you
You always said that you'd be here
How could you leave me now
We got so much more we can share

Chorus
