Stopped by to see you
Just the other day
And I wanna say
That I finally realized
The words "I love you" don't mean a thing
It's so hard for me to see
That you meant everything to me
But I guess I gotta move on
Even though it hurts I gotta be strong


If you don't wanna love me, don't love me
Don't wanna touch me, don't touch me
'Cause I don't want you to do anything
That you don't wanna do
If you don't wanna miss me, don't miss me
Don't wanna kiss me, don't kiss me
'Cause I don't want you to do anything
That you don't wanna do, no


Who would have known
All the nights that you were hanging late
All alone I'd lay awake in my bed
While someone else was putting food on your plate
I refuse to believe
That you never ever loved me
I've gotta move on, our love is gone
And this house is not a home, no


If you don't wanna love me, don't love me
Don't wanna touch me, don't touch me
'Cause I don't want you to do anything
That you don't wanna do
If you don't wanna miss me, don't miss me
Don't wanna kiss me, don't kiss me
'Cause I don't want you to do anything
That you don't wanna do, no


You can be lonely
I don't even care
But you didn't have to make me think that
You'll always be there
You said you'd be right there
So if you don't...


If you don't wanna love me, don't love me
Don't wanna touch me, don't touch me
'Cause I don't want you to do anything
That you don't wanna do
If you don't wanna miss me, don't miss me
Don't wanna kiss me, don't kiss me
'Cause I don't want you to do anything
That you don't wanna do, no


If you don't wanna love me, don't love me
Don't wanna touch me, don't touch me
'Cause I don't want you to do anything
That you don't wanna do
If you don't wanna miss me, don't miss me
Don't wanna kiss me, don't kiss me
'Cause I don't want you to do anything
That you don't wanna do, no


La oh ah, oh-oh ah
Oh-oh-oh
Oh oh, oh oh
