Turn up the bass, turn up the treble,
I'm about to take it to a whole another level!
DJ turn off what you're playin',
I want the whole club to hear what I'm sayin'!
Because this girl means so much to me,
And now we're on the floor and she touchin' me.
And if I wanna take her home
It's gotta be better than what they do on the radio!


It's gotta be the crunkest
It's gotta be the loudest
It's gotta be the best (the best) love song she ever heard in her life
I gotta tell her how I feel
I gotta let her hear, the best love song she ever heard in her life
No need for me to write it, I just gotta picture her smilin,
And if you feel that way
Go 'head and kiss your baby
And now we've got the whole stadium in love like eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh


Turn up the lights, give me a mic
I'm bout' to sing it to her just how she likes
Jump off the stage bombs away,
Crowd surfin' all the way (cowabunga)
You know it's right, just do the wave
Girl just move your body like a snake
And if you wanna get with me
Put your hands in the air, show me that energy


It's gotta be the crunkest
It's gotta be the loudest
It's gotta be the best (the best) love song she ever heard in her life
I gotta tell her how I feel
I gotta let her hear, the best love song she ever heard in her life
No need for me to write it, I just gotta picture her smilin,
And if you feel that way
Go 'head and kiss your baby
And now we've got the whole stadium in love like eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

Homie kiss your girl
Shawty kiss your man
We can see you on the kissing cam
Now show me some love (yeah yeah)
Show me some love (yeah yeah)
Now look her in the eye, say baby I love you
I never put no one above you
And if you feel that way
Go ahead and kiss your baby
And now we've got the whole stadium in love like eh
And if you feel that way
Go ahead and kiss your baby
And now we've got the whole stadium in love like
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Oh, oh, oh
