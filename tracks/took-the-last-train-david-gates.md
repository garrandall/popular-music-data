Took the last train to St. Tropez
Had in mind to dance the night away
Experimented with a cognac high
When in France you give everything a try

Soon the crowd dwindled down to two
Not a soul around but me and you
You just smiled in French and took my hand
Spoke the words I tried my best to understand

You're tellin' me
Viens chez moi
Ce soir va jamais terminer
On va rester toujours ensemble

You're tellin' me
Come with me
Tonight will last forever
We will stay together always, I love you

Woke the next day and found her note
Love ya, goodbye, that's all she wrote
And every night down at the place we met
I wait for her and those sweet words I can't forget

You're tellin' me
Viens chez moi
Ce soir va jamais terminer
On va rester toujours ensemble

'Cause I want you to
Come with me
Tonight will last forever
We will stay together always

I need you baby
Need you, need you bad
I took the last train, St. Tropez
I took the last train, St. Tropez
Took the last train, St. Tropez
I took the last train, St. Tropez
I took the last train, St. Tropez
I took the last train, St. Tropez
I took the last train, St. Tropez
