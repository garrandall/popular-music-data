I've been around the world it's true
Searching for someone exactly like you
And finally I found a love that is true
Whoa ho ho ho, whoa ho ho ho, whoa ho ho ho

Nobody know just how I feel
You had me spinning just like the spinning wheel
But finally I found a love that is true
Whoa ho ho ho, whoa ho ho ho, whoa ho ho

You heard my story, you heard just what I said
A man without love, he might as well be dead
But I finally I found a love that is true
Whoa ho ho ho, whoa ho ho ho, whoa ho ho ho

I've been around the world it's true
Searching for someone exactly like you
And finally I found a love that is true
Whoa ho ho ho, whoa ho ho ho, whoa ho ho ho
