You say, "Why does everything revolve around you?"
You say, "Why does everything I do confound you?"
You say that I pulled the world from under you,
You can't go through it this time

And I could be good, and I would - If I knew I was understood
And it'll be great, just wait - Or is it too little too late?

One day, this embarrassment will fade behind me
And that day I could think of things that won't remind me
But these days it's unbearable for both of us
We can't discuss it this way

I'm gaining strength, tying to learn pull my own weight
But I'm gaining pounds at the precipice of Too Late
Just Wait

I could be good, and I would - If I knew I was understood
And it'll be great, just wait - Or is it too little too late?

Record and play, after years of endless rewind
Yesterday wasn't half as tough as this time
This time isn't Hell,
Last time, I couldn't tell
This mind wasn't well
Next time, hope I'm
Going to be good, and I would -
If I knew I was understood
And it'll be great, just wait -
Or is it too little too late?
Good, and I would -
If I knew I was understood
And it'll be great, just wait -
Or is it too little too late?
