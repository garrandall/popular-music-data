Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell
Jimmy Rogers on the Victrola up high
Mama's dancing with baby on her shoulder
The sun is setting like molasses in the sky
The boy could sing, knew how to move, everything
Always wanting more, he'd give you longing for

Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
Black velvet if you please

Up in Memphis the music's like a heatwave
White lightning, bound to drive you wild
Mama's baby in the heart of every schoolgirl
"Love me tender" leaves 'em crying in the aisle
The way he moved, it was a sin, so sweet and true
Always wanting more, he'd give you longing for

Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
Black velvet if you please

Every song, every word that he sang was so surely
In a flash he was gone, it happened so soon
What could you do?

Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
Black velvet if you please

Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
Black velvet if you please, yeah
