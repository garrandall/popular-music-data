I don't wanna talk now
I don't wanna hear you scream no more
Want somebody to save me
Everything I do feels like its wrong
All we do is fall down
even though we try to stay afloat
I swear its gonna kill me
even though you think it wont
So why rock a boat and make waves
And everything's calm and okay
So why am I confused if you love me
Thought this would be smooth sailing

Cause I don't wanna let you go
and we're caught in the undertow
Cause I ain't losing my control
And we're caught in the undertow
I hold the prayer is all our own
but we need air we go alone
cause I don't wanna let you go
til we're caught in the undertow

I don't wanna cry every time we try it never fails
Change the illusion wanna be close set for sail
My hearts in your hand don't you go hurt me again
all we got is one chance and its sink or swim
So why rock a boat and make waves
And everything's coming okay
why am I confused if you love me
Thought this would be smooth sailing

Cause I don't wanna let you go
and we're caught in the undertow
Cause I ain't losing my control
And we're caught in the undertow
I hold the prayer is all our own
but we need air we go alone
cause I don't wanna let you go
til we're caught in the undertow

And the world is rising
And the world is rising
And the world is rising
And the world is rising

Cause I don't wanna let you go
Through the crowd in the undertow
And I'm losing my control
Through the crowd in the undertow
And I don't wanna let you go
But we're caught in the undertow
And I'm losing my control
Though we're caught in the undertow

Our only prayer is all our own
We both need air we go alone
Our only prayer is on our own
We both need air we go alone

Cause I don't wanna let you go
I don't wanna let you go
Cause we're caught in the undertow
