Orions arms are wide enough to hold us both together
Although we're worlds apart
I'd cross the stars for you
In the heart of a sleepless moon i'll be with you forever
This is my destiny
Til my life is through

The Arms of orion that's where i wanna be
Since you've been gone
I've been searching for a lover in the sea of tranquility
Drowning without you here my dear

When i'm lost or feel alone i just look to heaven
I find my comfort there
God only knows where you are tonight.

God only knows where you are tonight
Maybe time will tell me
Til then i close my eyes
Say a prayer for you
Say a prayer for you, to you.

The arms of orion that's where i wanna be
Since you've been gone i've been searching for a lover in the sea of tranquility
Drowning without you here my dear

Orions heart is bright enough to shine on both of us
The constellations never fail
To light the way for love

Orions arms are wide enough to hold us both together
Although we're worlds apart
I'd cross the stars for you
I'd cross the stars for you

The arms of orion that's where i wanna be
Since you've been gone i've been searching for a lover in the sea of tranquility
Drowning without you here my dear
Uh oh

The arms of orion that's where i wanna be
Since you've been gone i've been drowning
Lost
In the sea of tranquility
Lost
Drowning without you here my dear
Oooh my dear

Arms of orion
They're open wide
Arms of orion
Where i hide
That's where i wanna be
That's where i wanna be
The arms of orion
That's where i wanna be
The arms of orion
Since you've been gone babe
Since you've been gone i've been drowning
Drowning, Drowning
Drowning without your love
The arms of orion
The arms of orion
Ooooh oooh ooh oooh
