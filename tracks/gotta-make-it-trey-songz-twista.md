Just Gotta Make It (alright)

Just Gotta Make It (alright)
Just Gotta Make It
Just Gotta Make It (alright)
Just Gotta Make It

Shawty (shawty), all I got is a dollar and a dream
Is ya gonna roll wit me? (roll wit me)
You see I've tried a 9 to 5, and it just don't fit me
(fit me) (no)
I can get us out the hood and have us livin good
Ya feel me? (oh do feel me)
But I aint leavin here if you ain't wit me
(If you ain't wit me)
Cause girl a suit wit a smile that don't fit me
Taking a bus for some miles is gon kill me
(that's gon kill me)

I'm tryin' to turn it around,
start this thing from the ground
and as long as you're down I know,

Looking at you day after day, I know I
Just Gotta Make It (alright) Just Gotta Make It
(Just Gotta Make It)
Just to see that smile upon your face I know I
Just Gotta Make It (alright) I Just Gotta Make It
Everything I do I do for you and we
Just Gotta Make It (alright) Just Gotta Make It
To the top of the world me and my girl we
Just Gotta Make It (alright) Just Gotta Make It

Now, baby (baby)
one day soon you gone walk outside
(yes you are) and see a Mercedes
And I'm gone give ya the keys and tell ya 'go shoppin' (shoppin)
(and buy everything you want, buy everything you need,
make sure you get some sh** for me)
Then I can get us out the hood and have us livin good
But first I gotta know that you gonna roll

Cause girl a suit wit a smile that don't fit me
Taking a bus for some miles is gon kill me
(that's gon kill me)

I'm tryin' to turn it around, start this thing from the ground
and as long I kno you're gon be down

Looking at you day after day I know I
Just Gotta Make It (alright) I Just Gotta Make It
(Just Gotta Make It)
Just to see that smile upon your face I know I
Just Gotta Make It (alright) I Just Gotta Make It
Everything I do I do for you then we
Just Gotta Make It (alright) Just Gotta Make It (that's right)
To the top of the world me and my girl we
Trey Songz, Twista
Just Gotta Make It (alright) Just Gotta Make It



Even if I gotta go and cop a thing,
get up early an go standing on the block, some how I
(Just gotta make it) Thats Right
(Just gotta make it) Uh huh
Even if I have to sit wit the fellaz
at the round table and come up on a plot, some how I
(Just gotta make it) Baby girl I
(Just gotta make it) Uh huh
I'm telling you the truth on the daily
There's nothing I won't do for you baby,
Having big dreams that we ridin` in the Bently Contenental,
while me copping you a cute lil Mercedes
And I know I got the block hot,
but until I make happin for you baby I will not stop
I will drap you with diamonds and furs,
visions of your hurr blowin` in the wind from my drop top
(Like a baller, like a true shot caller)
The homie Trey Songz trippin`
all day long get me high too,
makin` that money for the family
(can I get up wi'cha its that nigga named twista)
Come and take a lil cruise with a jeep,
threw the chi-town streets cause you feelin me up on the inspiration whenever I'm

Looking at you day after day I know I
Just Gotta Make It (alright)
I Just Gotta Make It (Just Gotta Make It)
Just to see that smile upon your face I know I
Just Gotta Make It (alright) I Just Gotta Make It
Everything I do I do for you then we
Just Gotta Make It (alright)
Just Gotta Make It (that's right)
To the top of the world me and my girl we
Just Gotta Make It (alright) Just Gotta Make It
