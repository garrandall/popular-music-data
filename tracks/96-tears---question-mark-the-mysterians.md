Too many teardrops
For one heart to be cryin'
Too many teardrops
For one heart to carry on

You're way on top now
Since you left me
You're always laughin'
Way down at me

But watch out now
I'm gonna get there
We'll be together
For just a little while

And then I'm gonna put you
Way down here
And you'll start cryin'
96 tears

Cry
Cry

And when the sun comes up
I'll be on top
You'll be right down there
Lookin' up

And I might wave
Come up here
But I don't see you
Wavin' now

I'm way down here
Wonderin' how
I'm gonna get you
But I know now

I'll just cry
Cry
I'll just cry

Too many teardrops
For one heart to be cryin'
Too many teardrops
For one heart to carry on

You're gonna cry 96 tears
You're gonna cry 96 tears
You're gonna cry, cry, cry, cry, now
You're gonna cry, cry, cry, cry

96 tears, c'mon, let hear you cry, now
96 tears, woo, I wanna hear you cry
Night and day, yeah, all night long

96 tears, cry, cry, cry
C'mon baby, let me hear you cry now
All night long, 96 tears
Yeah, c'mon now, 96 tears
