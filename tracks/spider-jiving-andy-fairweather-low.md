There's a dead man's hand
Floating in the sky
Big nose people passing by
Crusing around on a mountain of air
Crusing around cause
They can dance away


Won't someone take away these blues
It's a shame but when I lose, I lose
I can't survive too much spider jive
I'm just about hanging on
Oh, Lord, don't make a poor boy run
It ain't easy living under a gun
Insanity's keeping me company
Insanity's on the loose
Yes, insanity's on the loose

There's an angel of madness
And she's bringing me down
She won't rest until
I'm in the ground

I'll keep searching everywhere I go
Find the answers that no one knows



You can't paint pictures
On a scarecrow's hat
Cause everybody's hoping
And that's a fact
Rich man, poor man going insane
Try all you want
But you can't mistake
