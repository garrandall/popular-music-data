Half of your love
Is just'not what I'm after.
Part of your world is just'
not what I need!
Some of your time is like'
One glass of water.
It just keeps me thirsty for wine!

So fill me up
To the top!
Oh don't you stop,
'till I'm over flowin'!
Love is the seed,
And babe I need'
You to keep it growin' stronger every day!
Oh Love, 
Don't take me half the way!
(Don't take me half the way!)
Don't take me half the way!
(Don't take me half the way!)

Never before'
Have I settled for seconds!
All of my life I have'
Hungered for more!

Now I can see where your'
Sweet love can lead me!
This is what I have waited for!

So fill me up
To the top!
Oh don't you stop,
'till I'm over flowin'!
Love is the seed,
And babe I need'
You to keep it growin' stronger every day!
Oh Love, 
Don't take me half the way!
(Don't take me half the way!)
Don't take me half the way!
(Don't take me half the way!)

Half of your love
Is just'not what I'm after'NO!
Part of your world is just'
not what I need!

Now I can see where your'
Sweet love can lead me!
This is what I have waited for!

So fill me up
To the top!
Oh don't you stop,
'till I'm over flowin'!
(Love)'Love is the seed,
And babe I need'
You to keep it growin' stronger every day!
Oh Love, 
Don't take me half the way!
(Don't take me half the way!)
Don't take me half the way!
(Don't take me half the way!)
Give me all your love!
(Don't take me half the way!)
Don't take me half the way!
(Don't take me half the way!)
Give me all your love!
(Don't take me half the way!)
