It's love when you're
Feeling like a child of light
It makes beautiful people
A sun tripper through the night

What you need is love (baby love)
When the under current gets you down
With topaz illusions and
Shadow confusions around

Keep going in and out of it
In and out of it
In and out of the sun
Keep going in and out of it
In and out of it
In and out of the sunshine

(Sun, sunshine)
Are you getting any sunshine
(Sun, sunshine)
Are you getting any sunshine
Sunshine, baby, sunshine, baby

It's love (baby love)
When you're going down a shining path
With the needles of sunshine
Weaving their way through the grass

What you need is love (baby love)
When you're tangled in a plastic dream
Baby, turn on the fever
And be a sun beamer with me

And we're going in and out of it
In and out of it
In and out of the sun
Keep going in and out of it
In and out of it
In and out of the sunshine

(Sun, sunshine)
Are you getting any sunshine
(Sun, sunshine)
Are you getting any sunshine
Sunshine, baby, sunshine, baby

It's love (baby love)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, Ooh
What you need is love (baby love)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, Ooh
What you need is love (baby love)
