I was thinking about her
Visiting the past
Reconstructing details with old photographs
Studying the faces
With an objective point of view
Suddenly remembering doesn't haunt me
At the time you couldn't tell me
That one day I'd be glad
That something that I thought was love was misinterpreted
She had another lover - she emphatically denied
But they were doin' me a favor
A blessing in disguise


If she would have been faithful
If she could have been true
Then I would've been cheated
I would never know real love
I would've missed out on you

I watch you sleeping - your body touchin' me
There's no doubt about it
This is where I want to be
It's so ironic- I had to lose to win
I want to thank her (Thank her again)




It's a paradox - full of contradiction
How I got from there to here
It defies a
Logical explanation
