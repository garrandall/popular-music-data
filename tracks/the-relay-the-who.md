You can hear it in the street,
See it in the dragging feet,
The word is getting out about control,
Spies they're come and gone,
The story travels on,
The only quiet place is inside your soul.
>from tree to tree,
>from you to me,
Travelling twice as fast as on any freeway.
Ev'ry single dream
Is wrapped up in the scheme,
They all get carried on the relay.
"Pass it on."
Someone disapproves
Of what you say or do,
I was asked to see what i could learn you;
Don't believe your eyes,
They're seeing only lies,
What is done in the first place don't concern you.
>from tree to tree ... etc.
Relay, things are brewing,
Relay, something's doin'
Relay, it's a revolution,
Relay, relay,
Hand me down a solution!
"Pass it on."
