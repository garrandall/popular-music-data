Oh that's me on the keys stupid
Yuherd
Haha
Down every night for the bread bitch I need that
Middle fingers up everyday fuck your feedback
9 with the beam finna aim take your knee cap
This not your girl anymore mind yo beezwax
Run to the bank while I laugh I don't chase hoes
Hella fast in this whip outta state flow
I'm in the lab making slaps you should take notes
Why would I ask for your dubs I need bankrolls

How the fuck is you fly with no haters?
Been in my bag I grind like a skater
9 on my hip and my 9 got a laser
This VSOP Hennessy with no chaser

Kloud Gang up big trap I be spazzing
Propain tongue when I spit call that gassin
Got no flame on my shit fire like a dragon
Your girl ain't home cus she here and I'm tapping
Your girl ain't home cus she here and I'm tapping
Meme god flow west coast beat slapping
Oh I produced this track how'd that happen
I get in the boof snap my fingers it's magic

Young rich squad man you boys can't even sit here
I ride with 3 hoes like a rain deer
Don't ask what's in my cup but it ain't beer
She bossed up was with you but she came here
Hahaha
Look

Ima gasser
I fuck like 2 times then I pass her
I met her last night she a dancer
She call me all night don't answer
Look

Said I'm broke man he probly high
Shawty didn't wanna fuck tell that bitch bye
Never end counting Guap like my bread pi
In a Benz smoking dope while I pass by
Aye
Sorry I ain't gotta hook for this
You should see the way the competition gon be shook from this
I be gassing everything I'm on I need a book for this
Hit me in the dm for my addy just to look for this
Haha
Ima mufuckin goblin
@kloudgod I'm a mufuckin god then
Clip knee high wanna talk then we Rob him
Those Levi's these some mufuckin Robbins
He three fly why that nigga always poppin
She three live when she dance never stopppin
That's your girl I ain't know she was chopping
It ain't really matter she already started topping

Ion need friends cus my bitch bad
I ain't let her fuck so your bitch mad
When I'm my bed I'm my bitch dad
Why you always talking bout the shit that you don't have
Aye
I don't lie check my bankroll
Hit some licks Gucci kicks I don't lace those
In the whip with my bitch counting pesos
I'm so sick roll my shit and I face those

Big watch big bands bitch
Got your main bitch lookin like a fan bitch
I done went from stacking up my dollars to a Benz bitch
I been in my bag I don't wanna be your friend bitch

Trap keys these the Trap keys
Trap please flip a pack like a trappiez
Stack cheese on the block work a bitch knees
Gucci to my socks you don't have these
