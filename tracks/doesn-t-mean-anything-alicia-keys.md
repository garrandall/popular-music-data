Used to dream of being a millionaire without a care
But if I'm seeing my dreams and you aren't there
'Cause it's over, that just won't be fair, darlin'
Rather be a poor woman livin' on the street, no food to eat
'Cause I don't want no pie if I have to cry
'Cause it's over when you said goodbye


All at once, I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything now that you're gone
From afar, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything since you're gone


Now I see myself through different eyes, it's no surprise
What being alone would make you realize
When it's over, all in love is fair
I shoulda been there, I shoulda been there, I shoulda, shoulda


All at once, I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything now that you're gone
From afar, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything since you're gone


I know I pushed you away
What can I do that will save our love?
Take these material things
They don't mean nothing, it's you that I want


All at once, I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything now that you're gone
From afar, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything since you're gone
(I shoulda been there, I shoulda been there, I shoulda, shoulda)
All at once, I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything now that you're gone
From afar, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything since you're gone
