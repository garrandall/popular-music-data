Tra la-la-la-la la-la-la-la
Happy birthday sweet-sixteen
Tra la-la-la-la la-la-la-la
Happy birthday sweet-sixteen

Tonight's the night I've waited for
Because you're not a baby anymore
You've turned into the prettiest girl I've ever seen,
Happy birthday sweet-sixteen

What happened to that funny face
My little tomboy now wears satins and lace
I can't believe my eyes you're just a teenage dream
Happy birthday sweet-sixteen

When you were only six I was your big brother
Then when you were ten we didn't like each other
When you were thirteen
You were my funny valentine
But since you've grown up
Your future is sewn up
From now on you're gonna be mine, so

If I should smile with sweet surprise
It's just that you've grown up before my very eyes
You've turned into the prettiest girl I've ever seen
Happy birthday sweet-sixteen

If I should smile with sweet surprise
It's just that you've grown up before my very eyes
You've turned into the prettiest girl I've ever seen
Happy birthday sweet-sixteen

Tra la-la-la-la la-la-la-la Happy birthday sweet-sixteen
Tra la-la-la-la la-la-la-la Happy birthday sweet-sixteen
Tra la-la-la-la la-la-la-la Happy birthday sweet-sixteen
