Havin' my baby
What a lovely way of sayin'
How much you love me
Havin' my baby
What a lovely way of sayin'
What you're thinkin' of me
I can see it, face is glowin'
I can see in your eyes
I'm happy you know it


That you're havin' my baby


You're the woman I love
And I love what it's doin' to ya


Havin' my baby


You're a woman in love
And I love what's goin' through ya


The need inside you
I see it showin'
Whoa, the seed inside ya
Baby, do you feel it growin'
Are you happy you know it
That you're


Havin' my baby


I'm a woman in love
And I love what it's doin' to me


Havin' my baby


I'm a woman in love
And I love what's goin' through me


Didn't have to keep it
Wouldn't put ya through it
You could have swept it from you life
But you wouldn't do it
No, you wouldn't do it


And you're havin' my baby


I'm a woman in love
And I love what it's doin' to me


Havin' my baby


I'm a woman in love
And I love what's goin' through me


Havin' my baby (havin' my baby)
What a lovely way of sayin'
How much you love me


Havin' my baby
(havin' my baby)


I'm a woman in love
And I love what's goin' through me
