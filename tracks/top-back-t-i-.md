Crème de la crème, homie, top shelf you know
I like my beat down low, down low, down low, down low
Down low, down low, down low, I like my top let back
Let back, let back, let back let back, let back


I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin 24's with a chopper in the back
You like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin 24's with a chopper in the back
You like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black


I'm the man in my city ain't nobody fucking wit me
You can ask the real niggas and all the bad bitches
I'm a known drug dealer I always have 50's
And the thugs and the killers was all in class wit me
SS'S on 26's watching some television
Shorty I'm never slipping got the Beretta in vision
And ready to pop the clip in, ready to get to tripping
Ready to show these folks a celebrity pistol whipping
Pimp stole the automobile and the roof for the tag missing
Polices' try to pursue me it's nothing but gas given
Addicted to fast living, guess I'm one of my dad's children
Think I'm bad now, you should've seen me before I had children
Give dick to your daddy's daughter and dare her to have children
Hope he got some insurance cause death her ass is enduring
Kill her in Mississippi and drive her ass to Missouri
Still my wet paint drippin' while I'm woodgrain gripping


I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin 24's with a chopper in the back
You like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin 24's with a chopper in the back
You like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black


I got this Pimp Squad Click, I know you heard about us
Young niggas filthy rich and we ain't worried about much
On this Glock I clutch, In God I trust
If a fuck nigga start, bet his heart I bust
Got your partners and the broad in your car fucked up
What, you're under estimation thought a star wouldn't bust
I got the heart and the guts on this purp I blow
Move 10 bricks daily trying to twerk 5 mo'
Ya see the Cadillac swerving down Hollywood Road
On the fliest Spur in Cali fucking Hollywood Ho's
On a pill and half with my partner Young Dro
Bumping Goodie Mob Soul Food number fo'
Other rappers' old news, told dudes I'ma pro
With a loaded fo' fo' and a quarter brick of blow
(Hey) nigga don't you hit me less you buying 6 or mo
My 24 blades glistening and my 808 kicking


I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin 24's with a chopper in the back
You like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin 24's with a chopper in the back
You like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black


I wear the crown down under man somebody better tell 'em
'Fore I spit a hundred rounds and have everybody bailing
I got some bitches in a Benz and my partners in the Chevy
And now we riding Giovanni's and Asani's on Pirellis
If you ever think of trying to run up on me just forget it
The clip in the chopper long as ya leg and leave ya shredded
Pistol way in the truck got my knife on tuck
You think he ain't getting stuck, you got life fucked up
A couple stitches in ya hip will have your night fucked up
Will he live? Will he die? Guess he might luck up
Meanwhile, I'm racing my Ferrari like a light for a buck
Against Lamborghini Gallardos every time I get a car


I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin 24's with a chopper in the back
You like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin 24's with a chopper in the back
You like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black
