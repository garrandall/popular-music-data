Well, it's five o'clock in the morning
feel just like the end of a mule
Somebody's been yawning
trying to break out the rules.
Yes, it's high time we went
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went there?
Ain't it high time we went?

Well, it's four o'clock in the morning,
somebody's shouting the news,
nobody's been yawning,
Preachers all around for the blues.
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?

Three o'clock and I'm dreaming,
somebody's shouting the way,
nobody can see me,
trying to find a brand new day.
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?

Two o'clock and I'm rolling,
everywhere I look is the same,
somebody's been calling,
trying to put the blame on my name.
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?

It's one o'clock and I'm falling,
falling for the same old game,
somebody's been shouting,
let me be by the stage.
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?

Well, it's twelve o'clock and I got there,
didn't think I'd make it in time,
somebody's been shouting,
"Don't forget the lemon and lime."
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?
