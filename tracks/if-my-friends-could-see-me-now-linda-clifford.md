F they could see me now
That old gang of mine
I'm eating fancy chow
And drinking fancy wine
I'd like those stumble bums
To see for a fact
The kind of top drawer
First rate chums I attract
All I can say is, wow
Hey, look at where I am
I've landed, pow
Right in a pot of jam
What a setup, holy cow
They'd never believe it
If my friends could see me
(If they could see me)
Said if my friends could see me
(If they could see me)
Oh, if my friends could see me
If they could see me now
If they could see me now
My little dusty prince
Chasing around
This million dollar chick
I'd hear those real hip cats
Say, brother, get her
Draped on a bedspread
Made of three kinds of fur

To think the highest brow
Which I must say is he
Should pick the lowest brow
Which there's no doubt is me
What a step up, holy cow
They'd never believe it
If my friends could see me
(If they could see me)
If all my friends could see me
(If they could see me)
Said if my friends could see me
If they could see me now
I'll rejoice with all my friends
I said rejoice with all my friends
If they could see me
If they could see me
If they could see me
If all my friends could see me
If they could see me now
That old gang of mine
Eating fancy chow
And drinking fancy wine
If all my friends could see me now
See me now, holy cow
If they could see me
If they could see me
If they could see me...
