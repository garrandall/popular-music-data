It's two tickets to a concert
It's a Daytona airbrush T-shirt
Wondering who's gonna kiss you first
You know what I'm talking about

Hey, baby, what you doing tonight?
It's butterflies and Bud Lights
Under the stars and on the stripes
Of a beach towel in a Spring Break town

It's playing in the night air
Through the speakers all night long
Couple kids just livin'
That American country love song

In every town, in every place
There's a boy who's trying to take a chance
And dance and find a way to run away with her heart
In the back of an old Ford truck
In the bar, just looking for love
In a pair ofâoh myâblue eyes, let them fireworks start

That American country love song
Ain't ever gonna quit playing on and on, and on

It's Chris loves Jenny on a license plate
It's daddy getting mad 'cause you came home late
It's one last kiss in the driveway
Hey, radio DJ, can you play that song
That she loves? So I can turn it up
And maybe turn her on
An American country love song

In every town, in every place
There's a boy who's trying to take a chance
And dance and find a way to run away with her heart
In the back of an old Ford truck
In the bar, just looking for love
In a pair ofâoh myâblue eyes, let them fireworks start

That American country love song
Ain't ever gonna quit playing on, and on, and on, and on

So let's raise a glass, cheerleaders and quarterbacks
Cowboys and country girls, all around this small town world
To the same old pick up lines, we've tried a million times
All the bad and good as it gets, to the ones that you ain't met yet

In every town, in every place
There's a boy who's trying to take a chance
And dance and find a way to run away with her heart
In the back of an old Ford truck
In the bar, just looking for love
In a pair ofâoh myâblue eyes, let them fireworks start

That American country love song
Ain't ever gonna quit playing on, and on, and on
