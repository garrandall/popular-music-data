You're a young man, a sweet guy
Handsome, kinda shy
You got a nice car, a steady job
Money, you got plenty of

What can I give a man with everything
Just one thing you need

(CHORUS)
You need one loving woman
Every home should have one
Two hearts filled with passion
Make your house a happy home
You'll never be alone
When you've got one loving woman
Every home should have one

I'm a woman longing
For loving, belonging
Got ideas, plenty of them
I can help you with your problems

Don't you know that I'm
Gonna give to you my everything
Everything you need

(CHORUS)

Don't you know that I'm
Gonna give to you my everything
Everything you need
Everything you need

You need one loving woman
Every home should have one
Two hearts filled with passion
Make your house a happy home
You'll never be alone

When you've got one loving woman
Every home should have one
Two hearts filled with passion
Make your house a happy home
Oh, you'll never be alone

When you've got one loving woman
Every home should have one
Two hearts filled with passion
Make your house a happy home
You'll never be alone
