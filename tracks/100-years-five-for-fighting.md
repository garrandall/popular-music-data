Show me a better bike than the one I got
If it makes any difference you can keep the lot
There's plenty of space in the parking lot

A head full of hopes
A pocket full of dreams
Handle bars coming apart at the seams

There goes Johnny America
Riding Hard up Mission Hill
Some think he'll make it to the top today
Some say he never will
Though he's just a child at heart
He's old enough to fall
Nobody in 100 years
Can touch him faults and all...

What you going to say about my little man
Take another shot, do the best you can
They're selling out souls in the grandstand

His Cap peeled back
Got Blood on his knees
Fighting back tears
Tearing through the breeze

There goes Johnny America
Riding Hard up Mission Hill
Some think he'll make it to the top today
Some say he never will
Though he's just a child at heart
He's old enough to fall
Nobody in 100 years
Can touch him faults and all...

He's come to far to fall

There goes Johnny America
Riding Hard up Mission Hill
Some think he'll make it to the top today
Some say he never will...

GO!
Go Johnny!
Go Johnny!

There goes Johnny America
Riding Hard up Mission Hill
Some think he'll make it to the top today
I say he will.
