I'm 15 for a moment
Caught in between 10 and 20
And I'm just dreaming
Counting the ways to where you are


I'm 22 for a moment
And she feels better than ever
And we're on fire
Making our way back from Mars


15 there's still time for you
Time to buy and time to lose
15, there's never a wish better than this
When you only got a hundred years to live


I'm 33 for a moment
Still the man, but you see I'm a "they"
A kid on the way, babe
A family on my mind


I'm 45 for a moment
The sea is high
And I'm heading into a crisis
Chasing the years of my life


15 there's still time for you
Time to buy and time to lose yourself
Within a morning star

15 I'm all right with you
15, there's never a wish better than this
When you only got a hundred years to live


Half time goes by
Suddenly you’re wise
Another blink of an eye
67 is gone
The sun is getting high
We're moving on...


I'm 99 for a moment
And dying for just another moment
And I'm just dreaming
Counting the ways to where you are


15 there's still time for you
22 I feel her too
33 you’re on your way
Every day's a new day
(oh oh oh)


15 there's still time for you
Time to buy and time to choose
Hey 15, there's never a wish better than this
When you only got a hundred years to live
