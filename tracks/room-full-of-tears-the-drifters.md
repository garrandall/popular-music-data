A room full of tears
A room full of tears

Raindrops keep a-falling
(Raindrops keeps a-falling)
Trickling down my window pane
(Trickling down my window pane)

As I sit here hoping
(As I sit here hoping)
And that you'll come back home again
(That you'll come back home again)

Since you've gone, I can't go on
I know my heart would surely break

Here am I lonely
(Lonely)
Left here with only
(Only)
A room full of tears
(A room full of tears)

Everyone keeps asking
(Everyone keeps asking)
If you're really gone away
(If you're really gone away)

My pride won't let me answer
(Pride won't let me answer)
And I really don't know what to say
(Really don't know what to say)

I made you mine, you said goodbye
Oh, where did I make my mistake?

Here am I lonely
(Lonely)
Left here with only
(Only)
A room full of tears
(A room full of tears)

All this strain and all this pain
Is just much more than I can take

Here am I lonely
(Lonely)
Left here with only
(Only)
A room full of tears
(A room full of tears)

A room full of tears
(A room full of tears)
A room full of tears
(A room full of tears)
