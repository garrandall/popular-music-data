Whoa, it's all right
It's all right
It's all right
Honey, it's all right
Long as I know, long as I know that you love me
Honey, it's all right
It's all right
It's all right
It's all right
Honey, it's all right
Long as I know, long as I know that you love me
Baby, it's all right


All my friends tell me that you found somebody new
They report to me every little thing that you do
But long as you tell me that it's all untrue
Baby, it's all right


Whoa, it's all right
It's all right
It's all right
Believe me when I say it's alright
Long as I know, long as I know that you love me
Baby, it's all right

Oh oh

One more thing I want you to know


If you're ever worried
If you're all alone
Just remember darling that I'm as near as your telephone
And if you need me, honey all you got to do is to call me
Believe me, it's all right


Oh, it's all right
It's all right
It's all right
Honey, it's all right
Long as I know, long as I know that you love me
Baby, it's all right


Oh, help me to tell 'em one more time
It's all right
It's all right
It's all right
It's all right
Honey, long, long, long as I know, long as I know that you love me
It's all right
