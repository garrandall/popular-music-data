You kiss me real good now
Like I knew that you could now
Time to do what you should now
Because you're getting to me

Oh, no, no, no, boy
Got to take it real slow, boy
This is far as we go, boy
Until you hear what I hear

I hear those church bells ringing
Will you marry me
Will you carry me
Across the threshold tenderly

I hear those church bells ringing
Can't you hear them too
Listen, honey
Ringing, I love you

Let's get it together
The sooner the better
God, I can't wait forever
When I need you right now

Ain't getting much stronger
Can't resist you much longer
To let you go would be wronger
Than to love you right now

I hear those church bells ringing
Will you marry me
Will you carry me
Across the threshold tenderly, yeah

I hear those church bells ringing
Can't you hear them too
Listen, honey
Singing, I love you

Oh, honey
I hear those church bells ringing
Will you marry me
Will you carry me
Across the threshold tenderly, yeah

I hear those church bells ringing
Can't you hear them too
Listen, honey
Singing, I love you

I hear those church bells ringing
Will you marry me...
