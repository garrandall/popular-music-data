Said the fight to make ends meet
Keeps a man upon his feet
Holding down his job
Trying to show he can't be bought

It takes every kinda people
To make what life's about, yeah
Every kinda people
To make the world go 'round

Someone's looking for a lead
In his duty to a king or to a creed
Protecting what he feels is right
Fights against wrong with his life

There's no profit in deceit
Honest men know that revenge does not taste sweet
Whether yellow, black or white
Each and every man's the same inside

It takes every kinda people
To make what life's about, yeah
It takes every kinda people
To make the world go 'round

Do do do, do do do, oh
Never knew, no no no no no

You know that love's the only goal
That could bring a peace to any soul
Hey and every man's the same
He wants the sunshine in his name

It takes every kinda people
To make what life's about, yeah
It takes every kinda people
To make the world go 'round

Every kinda people
To make what life's about
It takes every kinda people
To make the world go 'round
