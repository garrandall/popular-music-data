We headed out to California
Everybody tried to warn us
Said we wouldn't make it any further
Than that worn out Chevy would

We broke down a time or two
Thought "maybe we didn't think it through"
We were all we had to turn to
When it wasn't lookin' good

We're lookin' back laughin'
'cause they called us crazy


We were young, we were wild, we were restless
Had to go, had to fly - had to get away
Took a chance on that feelin' - baby
We were lovin' blind - borderline reckless
We were livin' for the minute we were spinnin' in
Maybe we were a lot of things
But we weren't crazy

Just a couple kids a couple years ago
Now we gotta couple kids of our own
We turn out right - proved them wrong
Look at us goin' strong

Lookin' back laughin'
'cause they called us crazy



Coulda set it down
When things got tough
Coulda walked away from this love
But that'd been crazy

We were young, we were wild, we were restless
Had to go, had to fly, had to get away
Took a chance on that feeling
We were lovin blind, borderline reckless
We were livin for the minute we were spinning in
Maybe we were a lot of things
Oh maybe we were a lot of things
But we werent crazy
We weren't crazy
We weren't crazy
