My boyfriend got a Beatle haircut

My boyfriend got a Beatle haircut
Oh unhappy day!
My boyfriend got a Beatle haircut
Now I can't chase the girls away
Once he was mine all mine alone
We'd talk all day on the telephone
Now I can't, his phone is busy
All the girls keep asking "Where is he?"
(Asking "Where is he?")
My boyfriend got a Beatle haircut
So, to keep him true
I got a Beatle haircut too

Once he was mine all mine alone
We'd talk all day on the telephone
Now I can't, his phone is busy
All the girls keep asking "Where is he?"
(Asking "Where is he?")
My boyfriend got a Beatle haircut
So, to keep him true
I got a Beatle haircut too

I got a Beatle haircut too
