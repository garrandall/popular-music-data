When you walk through a storm
Hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of the storm
There's a golden sky
And the sweet silver song of the lark


Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown


Walk on, walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone


When you walk through a storm
Hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of the storm
There's a golden sky
And the sweet silver song of the lark


Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown


Walk on, walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk
You'll never walk
You'll never walk alone
