Why dont you go into the next room and start getting undressed? What's your pleasure? 

Fat sweaty Betty
The bitch ain't nuttin' new
Her ma's used to babysat me back when we was two
We drove to the playground
And to the skatin' rink
Then we'd go under the bleachers
And she'd let me hit the "stank" well uh
Then she moved across town
And never came back
Until the other day I seen her at the chicken shack
She said her name was Betty
I can't believe the shit
The sexy little girl is now a fat sweaty biiiiitch
She said, "Hey J
Tell me how ya' been?"
She had a piece of chicken gizzard stuck to her chin
I told her, "Hold still"
And flicked it off her face
And said, "Betty, oh, Betty
Whatcha say we leave this place?"
I took her back to the crib and hit it all night
I let my fingers run across her rippled cellulite
OOOOHH it was nasty
But I don't let it bother me
She rolled over, fuckin' knocked the wind outta me
I couldn't breathe
She wouldn't stop
I'm almost dead
I took the lamp
And bust it on her fuckin' head
We got dressed
I gave 'er little kiss g'bye
Fat sweaty Betty
My fat sweaty punkin' pie

Fat sweaty bitch
Knockin' on my door
You want some chilli pie and you want some coney dog?
I told you once before, I tell ya once again
I'll serve you up a plate when you let me hit the skins

There's this big fat slop of shit
People called Betty
Flaps of fat on the back, her neck
Sweaty
Boogers runnin' out'er nose
All over her lips
Can't tell the difference from her titties to her hips
But fuck all that
Cuz' I wanna' see the neden
I had to see the cat
The cheesy cheetah chedden
I rode my bike to her house
Said "Yo, Betty let me in
I'm packin' some snack cakes
Bitch let me in"
(Thump, thump)
I can hear her comin' down the stairs
She opened up the door in her motha' fuckin' underwears
EEEWWWWW, Shit, Fuck that!
I'm turnin' back
But no, the door shut
And she's goin' for the cake snack
I said "Relax, ho
I'm here on bus-i-ness
You can have the candy
First you gotta' wait a bit
I need a favor
C'mon Betty drop them drawers"
AAAHHHH, I knew it
Betty had balls
Oh, no
Here comes that ass
From the top of the dresser
With the Yokazuna splash
I wish I never came
Oh boy, do I wish
She's fat sweaty Betty
The sweaty fat biiiiitch

Fat sweaty bitch
Knockin' on my door
You want some chilli pie and you want some coney dog?
I told you once before, I tell ya once again
I'll serve you up a plate when you let me hit the skins

I know you like spaghetti
I know you like spaghetti, so tell me when you're ready, baby
Fat sweaty bitch
I know you like spaghetti
I know you like spaghetti, so tell me when you're ready, baby
Tell me when you're ready
Tell me when you're ready for a cheeseburger pizza pie tv dinner
Chicken baby
I gets it all
I gets it all for ya baby
I work at Farmer Jack on the dinner floor baby
I bring it home, I cook it in a microwave
I feed it to ya, just let me get some sticky skins
'Cause I don't care, I wanna hit the cellulite
I hit the cellulite for a turkey meal delight
'Cause you know I don't care, you know I'm not afraid to cook
Take off your shoes and let me lick your dirty foot
I rub ya down
I rub ya down the right way
I hear a buzzer, apple pie's in the microwave
I work at Farmer Jack, I work at A&P
And yes I know my heavy baby wanna be with me
Ya wanna be with me?
Ya wanna be with me?
Ya want some chilli cheese fries and a hoagie?
Like  wait 'til the time is right
Let me count the purple bubbles in your cellulite
Ya want some Burger King?
Ya want some Hungry Jack?
Ya want some jelly beans?
You want a Scooby snack?
Ya want some Domino's?
Ya want a Milky Way?
You gotta kick it to the sugar daddy Violent J
Ya want some Lucky Charms?
Ya want some mashed potaters?
Let me hit the skins now and I'll feed you later
Because I know
I know you want a Lunchable
Something crunchable, something crunchable
How 'bout some Taco Bell?
How 'bout a pizza slice?
How 'bout some chicken fingers and a bowl of Minute Rice?
(Fat sweaty bitch)
