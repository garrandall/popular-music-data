The radio and a sundress
Making my world all a mess
Back corner of a cornfield
Bottle tops and the truth spills
Pull the lever, lay the seat back laughin'
You slippin' off your shoes
While the dashboard speakers sing every word of "Night Moves"

I wanna be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong
I wanna be that song
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be that song
Ohh, I wanna be, I wanna, I wanna

I wanna stand with you in the third row
Window booth at a bar
Back pew on a Sunday pourin' out your heart
When the bleachers are crowded
When you're sittin' all alone
When the rain is pourin' and you need something to take you home

Let me be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong
I wanna be that song
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be that song
Ohh, I wanna be, I wanna, I wanna

When you're searching the horizon
When your eyes look back
When you're standing in the moment
Every life has a soundtrack

Oh, I wanna be, I wanna be, oh, I wanna be
I wanna be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong
I wanna be that song

When the highway's calling
When the bottle's dry
When the sky is falling and you're asking yourself why
Oh, Oh, I wanna be, yeah, oh.
