High life
Yeah yeah, yeah, uh


It's 2:30 in the morning
'Round this time you know we going in, yeah
I had to kiss so you don't throw it in, no
But you get crazy when you're horny


I feel like I should be your lover, I should be your friend
All those silly issues made up in your head
Money can pay for your time but it's not love (Yeah)
And love cannot pay for that shit that I bought ya
Swear to God I should be gone, leave you alone, 'cause I


Rather be with you and all your bullshit
Rather be with you and all your bullshit
I'd rather be with you and all your bullshit
Rather be with you and all your bull
You (Yeah, babe)
You (Ohhoo, yeah)
You, yeah


This is what I don't get
Don't know why I'm still here
All my passwords reset, yeah
And I know you did that shit


'Cause money can pay for your time but it's not love
And love cannot pay for that shit that I bought ya, yeah
Oh got me up on some drama
Knowin' this shit is a problem, yeah
Swear to God I should be gone, leave you alone, but I


Rather be with you and all your bullshit
Rather be with you and all your bullshit
I'd rather be with you and all your bullshit
Rather be with you and all your bull
You (Yeah, babe)
You (Ohhoo, yeah)
You, yeah


Know you got problems
You got a lot of problems
Know damn well I can solve 'em
You got a lot of problems
Know you got problems


I should be your lover, I should be your friend
All those silly issues made up in your head
Money can pay for your time but it's not love
And callin' me back with some bullshit like, "What up?"
Swear to God I should be gone, leave you alone, 'but I


Rather be with you and all your bullshit
Rather be with you and all your bullshit
I'd rather be with you and all your bullshit
Rather be with you and all your bull (Stunna Music)
You (High life)
