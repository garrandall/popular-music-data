Don’t tell me love is something you won’t try again
That’s just not true
But baby right now maybe what you need‘s a friend
Well, I'm here for you


I will be by your side
If ever you fall deep in the dead of the night
Whenever you call
And I won’t change my mind
No, I’ll see you through
And I won’t give up
No, I won’t give up
I won’t give up on you


You need someone who knows you from the inside out
The way I do
I seen you walk the wire never looking down
I believe in you


I will be by your side
If ever you fall deep in the dead of the night
Whenever you call
And I won’t change my mind
No, I’ll see you through
And I won’t give up
No, I won’t give up
I won’t give up on you


I will be by your side
If ever you fall deep in the dead of the night
And I won’t give up
No, I won’t give up
I won’t give up
You can call it love
But I won’t give up on you
