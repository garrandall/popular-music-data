We The Best Music
Anotha' one
DJ Khaled

Celebrate for the ones we lost, yeah
Celebrate with the ones we got here
Middle finger to the ones that's not here
Ain't no love, ain't no love lost
Celebrate for the ones we lost, yeah
Celebrate with the ones we got here
Middle finger to the ones that's not here
Ain't no love, ain't no love lost

People tend to lose it, they see you comin' up
And you were talkin' stupid, you wish you bit your tongue
Your blood is burnin' Butane, I know it eats you up
And I just keep it movin', that envy got you stuck

Now we print money and you drive a Jetta
Ever since I cut you off I swear that life is better
And no, nobody believe' you, you can say whatever
While we party in Ibiza like we (DJ Khaled)

And we ain't never losin' no sleep over ya
And that's why we gon' dedicate this toast to ya, toast to ya
(Let's go)

Celebrate for the ones we lost, yeah
Celebrate with the ones we got here
Middle finger to the ones that's not here
Ain't no love, ain't no love lost
Celebrate for the ones we lost, yeah
Celebrate with the ones we got here
Middle finger to the ones that's not here
Ain't no love, ain't no love lost

In a Lambo truck it's not a Panorama
Even though I got the vision and it's panorama
Outgrew my faded T, I guess we made it out Atlanta
When the closest thing to tropic was the Tropicana (Yah!)

Yellin', "Free the guys", pourin' for the guys
To my dog 50 on the other side
Pop me one, pop me two, pop me three
(Another one)

Celebrate for the ones we lost, yeah
Celebrate with the ones we got here
Middle finger to the ones that's not here
Ain't no love, ain't no love lost
Celebrate for the ones we lost, yeah
Celebrate with the ones we got here
Middle finger to the ones that's not here
Ain't no love, ain't no love lost
(Ain't no love lost, ain't no love lost, ain't no love lost)

Ain't no love, ain't no love lost (Ain't no love lost, ain't no love lost)
(Yah!)

Ain't no love, ain't no love lost (Yah!)
(Ain't no love lost, ain't no love lost)

I'm a bad man, dressed with good things
I'm a world class nigga, hood see
I been with it
I been choosey, with a big bag movin' loosely
I been with it (Yah!)
(Let's go)

Celebrate for the ones we lost, yeah
Celebrate with the ones we got here
Middle finger to the ones that's not here (Yah!)
Ain't no love, ain't no love lost
Celebrate for the ones we lost, yeah
Celebrate with the ones we got here
Middle finger to the ones that's not here
Ain't no love, ain't no love lost
(Ain't no love lost, ain't no love lost, ain't no love lost)

As we continue to celebrate, celebrate life
(Ain't no love, ain't no love lost)
It's always love
(We The Best Music)
Ain't no love, ain't no love lost
(Ain't no love lost, ain't no love lost, ain't no love lost, ain't no love lost)
