I've been born again, I'm a brand new man
Kind of brand new, I've been born again
Saturday night in the city, parties on every block
It's a temptation for a man who loves to party
But my party days had to stop
So brothers, you can keep your street life
Changin' women like you change your clothes
'Cause every woman I need, she's wrapped up in one
My love just grows and grows
Well, a whole lot of women is an ego trip
I'd rather spend my time kissin' baby's sweet lips
I've been born again, there's a change in me
I've been born again, I said a change, a change
I've been born again, there's a change in me
I've been born again, I said a change, a change
Oh, I'm not a Casanova, my playin' days are over
I think, I'm gonna start me a fire
Got my matchbox in my hand
Burnin' up the pages in my little black book
Start my life all over again
I don't need no women in excess
I can't afford to spread my lovin' around
'Cause when my woman, she's needin' me by her side
I just don't wanna let her down
Well, a whole lot of women is an ego trip
I'd rather spend my time kissin' baby's sweet lips
I've been born again, there's a change in me
I've been born again, I said a change, a change
I've been born again, there's a change in me
I've been born again, I said a change, a change
Oh, I'm not a Casanova, my playin' days are over
Now I don't need a lot of women
Just to prove my manhood
I got me one special woman
So I can be the man that I should
Well, a whole lot of women is an ego trip
I'd rather spend my time kissin' baby's sweet lips
I've been born again, there's a change in me
I've been born again, I said a change, a change
I've been born again, there's a change in me
I've been born again, I said a change, a change
