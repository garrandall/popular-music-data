Shades of green
Was the last thing that you'd seen
As you left your hungry child
And kissed him on his brow
As you walked away
And sadly waved goodbye

Never gonna kiss his lips or hold his hand
Never gonna see him grow up, become a man
You want to shout and tell the world of what you've done
Although you know you couldn't provide for your son
Now you know you did just what you had to do
But doing what you did still bothers you
But time has passed and life has moved along
Neverending memories still linger on
On and on

Shades of green
Never leave your restless dreams
You can hear your baby cry
You can see him in the night
All wrapped in green as you left him far behind

Never gonna see him play or run about
Never gonna hear 'momma' ringing out
As the thought keeps tumblin' through your mind each day
You punish yourself, you bend, you kneel and pray
Oh how I wish you were me and I were you
So I could bear this hurt you're goin' through
Take my hand and close your mind to what you see
Let's make a brand new life for you and me
You and me

Shades of green
Was the last thing that you'd seen
As you left your hungry child
And kissed him on his brow
As you walked away
And sadly waved goodbye

Shades of green
Never leave your restless dreams
You can hear your baby cry
You can see him in the night
All wrapped in green as you left him far behind
