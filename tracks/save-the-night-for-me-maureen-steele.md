No one ever told me
Love could hurt like this
I picture her there in your arms
Loving every kiss

You said there was someone else
Can't say I never knew
But you give her so much each day
Is asking too much of you?

To save the night for me
A little time
So we can be together

Save the night for me
I need you now
Oh, baby
More than ever
Save the night for me

The clock on the wall
Keeps on ticking the time away
Visions of us in the night
Get me through the day

Maybe I am just a fool
To be at your command
But I want you so bad
That I will take anything I can

To save the night for me
A little time
So we can be together

Save the night for me
I need you now
Oh, baby
More than ever
Save the night for me

Save the night for me
I need you now
Baby more than ever

Save the night for me
Baby, let's be together
Save the night for me
A little time
So we can be together

Save the night for me
I need you now
Baby
More than ever

Save the night for me
Night for me
Oh, darling
I'm gonna need your loving

Save the night
Save the night
You got to know
I just can't live without you

Save the night for me
A little time
So we can be together

Save the night for me
I need you now
Oh, baby
More than ever
