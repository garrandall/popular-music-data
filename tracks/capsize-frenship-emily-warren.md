Hey-ey-ey-ey-yeah
Hey-ya, hey-ya, hey
Hey-ey-ey-ey-yeah
Hey-ya, hey-ya, hey


Up at night I'm awake cause it haunts me
That I never got to say what I wanted
Oh my God, oh my God
Iâ€™m not the same as I was with you
I would jump out my skin just to get you
Oh my God, oh my God


How could you have ever known if I never let it show
Now I just wanna know, are you...


Yeah, I'm fine
Drop tears in the morning
Give in to the lonely
Here it comes with no warning
Capsize, I'm first in the water
Too close to the bottom
I'm right back where I started
Said I'm fine


Hey-ey-ey-ey-yeah
Hey-ya, hey-ya, hey
Hey-ey-ey-ey-yeah
Hey-ya, hey-ya, hey


Your silhouette is burned in my memory
Rubble left from the moment that you left me
Oh my God, oh my God
And three words have never come easy
Cause you're more than they ever could be
Oh my God, oh my God


How could you have ever known if I never let it show
Now I just wanna know, are you...


Yeah, I'm fine
Drop tears in the morning
Give in to the lonely
Here it comes with no warning
Capsize, I'm first in the water
Too close to the bottom
I'm right back where I started
Said I'm fine


Hey-ey-ey-ey-yeah
Hey-ya, hey-ya, hey
Hey-ey-ey-ey-yeah
Hey-ya, hey-ya, hey


I'm swimming up against the tide
Oh my god
I'm swimming but I'm getting tired
Oh my god
I'm swimming up against the tide
Oh my god
I'm swimming but I'm getting tired
Oh my god


Yeah, I'm fine
Drop tears in the morning
Give in to the lonely
Here it comes with no warning (no warning)
Capsize, I'm first in the water
Too close to the bottom
I'm right back where I started
Said I'm fine (fine)


Hey-ey-ey-ey-yeah
Hey-ya, hey-ya, hey (Said I'm fine)
Hey-ey-ey-ey-yeah
Hey-ya, hey-ya, hey


I think about you, love you, and am filled with pride
