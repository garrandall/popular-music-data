I never can say goodbye
I never can say goodbye

Even though the pain and heartache
Seems to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show
Then you try to say you're leaving me
And I always have to say no
Tell me why is it so

That I
Never can say goodbye (say goodbye)
No no no no, now
Never can say goodbye (say goodbye)

Every time I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right to the core
It says, "turn around you fool
You know you love him more and more"
Tell me why is it so
Don't want to let you go

I never can say goodbye, boy
Ooh baby, I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, ooh
I never can say goodbye, boy
Ooh baby, I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, ooh

I never can say goodbye, oh no, now
I never can say goodbye

I keep thinking that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
And that anguish and that doubt
It's that same old dizzy hang-up
I can't do with you or without
Tell me why is it so
Don't want to let you go

I never can say goodbye, boy
Ooh, I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, ooh
I never can say goodbye, boy
Ooh, I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, ooh yeah
I never can say goodbye, boy
Ooh, I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, ooh
I never can say goodbye, boy, yeah, yeah, yeah
I never can say goodbye, no no no, no no no, oh oh
