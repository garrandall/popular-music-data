Alright lets go in the club man

Bro, how many 1â²s you gettin bro
Alright fuck wit me Ill see you in then
(Uhhhh)


Round of applause, baby make that ass clap
Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap
Round of applause, baby make that ass clap
Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap
let me see you, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
Baby drop it to the floor and
Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bu-bust it, bust it
Drop it down and just,


Uhhhhh bust it like you cant afford a car,
You a star, you look in a mirror you know who you are, Right?
Cool, take it low, take it way lower than that
I fly private when I go, ain't no layover on that
Yeah I made it to the top, took a seat still sittinâ
Man I'm up in stadium in DC still tippin,
She coulda paid tuition 5 times, still strippin
I just throw a couple bills and sheâll have a pair a heels? (Ohh No)
There I go, magic trickin on yo ass, throwin every president except for Nixon on yo ass
Make you rich I feel I should make commission on yo ass,
Wonder what youâd ever do If I went missinâ on yo ass, huh?


Round of applause, baby make that ass clap
Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap
Round of applause, baby make that ass clap
Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap
let me see you, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
Baby drop it to the floor and
Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bu-bust it, bust it
Drop it down and just,


Bounce that ass, shake that ass like the twerk team
Hair long, ass phat, shawty mean
That girl look like Halle Berry when I'm on them beans
When I hit the scene girls yellinâ and they scream
Flocka can you be my baby daddy?
Pimpin like I'm dolemite, hoes jump in my caddy
Smoke like I got Cataract, In the strip club throwin up them stacks
Got racks on top of racks, bust that pussy make that ass clap, clap, clap
I ain't done wit you baby bring that ass back
Still got 20â²s, still got 50â²s, even got them 100â²s
Throw some money, throw some money, Imma let it go,
Waka Flocka Flame better know as Mr.Let It Go


Round of applause, baby make that ass clap
Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap
Round of applause, baby make that ass clap
Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap
let me see you, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
Baby drop it to the floor and
Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bu-bust it, bust it
Drop it down and just


Bounce that ass, shake that ass like the twerk team
bust it, bust it, like the twerk team
bust it, bust it, like the twerk team
Bricksquad monopoly, shawty that's my home team
All the smokers they gangsta green, Cant do no G talk
I need a classy girl in the bed she ain't gotta be a freak hoe
Bust it, bust it, Lay down on that floor girl
Bust it, bust it, gimme some more head girl


Round of applause, baby make that ass clap
Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap
Round of applause, baby make that ass clap
Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap
let me see you, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
Baby drop it to the floor and
Bust It, bust it, bust it, bust it, bu-bust it, bust it
Drop it down and just.
