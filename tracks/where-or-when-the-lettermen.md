It seems we stood and
Talked like this before
We looked at each other
In the same way then but
I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing
Are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling
You were smiling then but
I can't remember where or when

Some things that
Happen for the first time
Seems to be happening again

And so it seems that
We have met before
And laughed before
And loved before but
Who knows where or when
