I used to go out to parties
And stand around
Cause I was too nervous
To really get down
But my body yearned to be free
I got up on the floor and thought
Somebody could choose me
No more standin' there beside the walls
I done got myself together baby
And now I'm havin' a ball
As long as you're groovin'
There's always a chance
Somebody watches
Might wanna make romance

Move your body, ooo baby, you dance all night
To the groove and feel alright
Everybody's groovin' on like a fool
But if you see me spread out and let me in
Baby just party high and low
Let me step into your erotic zone

Move it up
Turn it 'round
Shake it down
OOWWWW

You can love me when you want to babe
This is such a groovy party baby
We're here face to face
Everybody's swingin'
This is such a groovy place
All the young ladies are so fine!
You're movin your body easy with no doubts
I know what you thinkin' baby
You wanna turn me out
Think I'm gonna let you do it babe

Keep on dancin'
You got to get it
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin' (You got to get it)
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin' (You got to get it)
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin' (You got to get it)
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin' (You got to get it)
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin' (You got to get it, oh darling)
Got to give it up

Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh

If you want to dance, dance
So good
Dancing

So good
You got me babe
It's so good


Spend the night
