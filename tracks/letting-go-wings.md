Ah, she tastes like wine
Such a human being so divine
Oh, she feels like sun (Like sun)
Mother nature look at what you've done


Oh, (Oh) I feel like letting go
Oh, (Oh) I feel like letting go


Oh, she looks like snow
I wanna put her in a Broadway show
Ah, she'll dance and dine
Like a lucifer she'll always shine


Oh, (Oh) I feel like letting go
Oh, (Oh) I feel like letting go

Oh, oh, I feel like letting go
Oh (Oh) I feel like letting go


Oh, she sings it so
I want to put her on the radio
One day and there you are
Ladies and gentleman
A brand new star


Oh, I feel like letting go
Oh, I feel like letting go
