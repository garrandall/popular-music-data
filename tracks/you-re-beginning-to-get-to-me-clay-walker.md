I can't sleep at all
I'm making late night calls
Just to talk to you and hear your voice again
That flower shop on Main
Knows me by my first name
And how I want the card to read
And where I want the roses set

I'm not saying I'm in love
I'd admit it if I was
I'm just saying I believe
You're beginning to get to me
The way I need you all the time
The way you hold this heart of mine
I think it's time that I concede
You're beginning to get to me

I've got your picture up
On the dash of my new truck
So I can have you with me every road I'm on
Baby, what I feel
Is just a tip of what I will
I can only guess What I'll be like
When I'm completely gone

I'm not saying I'm in love
I'd admit it if I was
I'm just saying I believe
You're beginning to get to me
The way I need you all the time
The way you hold this heart of mine
I think it's time that I concede
You're beginning to get to me

I'm not saying I'm in love
I'd admit it if I was
I'm just saying I believe
You're beginning to get to me
The way I need you all the time
The way you hold this heart of mine
I think it's time that I concede
You're beginning to get to me
