Let's Live Together
LET'S LIVE TOGETHER
Road Apples
Hey baby I got to tell you something
Something you oughta know
You're the honey in my sweet life
I oughta let it show
When I think about the good times
Baby that I had with you
When I feel the way I'm feeling
The fire baby got to let you know
Oh baby got to let you know
I want you baby
I need you baby
I love you baby
Let's live together
I love you baby
I's thinkin' maybe say come on baby
Let's live together
Now baby I wanna tell you something
Something been on my mind
You're the sun and the spring of my life
I oughta let it shine now
When I think about the happiness
When I think that you got me feeling like this
Baby gotta let you know
Gotta let you know

(repeat chorus)
