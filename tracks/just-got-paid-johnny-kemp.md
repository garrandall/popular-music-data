Just got paid; it's Friday night
Party hunting, feeling right
Body shaking, all around
Know one thing: I'm getting down


Check the mirror, I'm looking fly
Round up my posse, jump in my ride
Radio rocking a monster jam
Feel the rhythm, pump up the sound


Feeling so good
Don't you know I'm just grooving to the beat?
I'm grooving, grooving
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


Just got paid; it's Friday night
Party hunting, the bass is right
Booty shaking all around
Poured my drink, now I'm getting down


On the floor rocking to the beat
Oh-wee, you sure look sweet
Fine young lady, standing by
Come on, baby, sweet eye delight


I love the way that you move; you look so sweet
When you're moving to the beat
I'm tired of all these boring parties
Why don't we get on down?
Come on, let's get on down now




Getting down
Say ho (You say it)
Say ho-ho (Ho-ho)
Say ho


On the floor rocking to the beat (Rocking, baby)
Oh-wee, you sure look sweet
Fine young lady standing by (Come here)
Come on, baby, look me in my eye




Getting down, yeah, getting down
Say ho (Ho-ho)
Say ho-ho (Ho-ho-ho)
Say ho


Teddy, you play it

Shake it up, shake it up
I just got paid
I'm feeling, I'm feeling right




Just got paid, it's Friday
 have a good time
Having a good time, baby
Having a good time, baby
I'm getting down
Getting down, getting down


I'm getting down down
I'm getting down down
