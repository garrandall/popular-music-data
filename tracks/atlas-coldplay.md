Some saw the sun
Some saw the smoke
Some heard the gun
Some bent the bow

Sometimes the wire must tense for the note
Caught in the fire, say oh
We're about to explode

Carry your world, I'll carry your world
Carry your world, I'll carry your world

Some far away
Some search for gold
Some dragon to slay
Heaven we hope is just up the road

Show me the way, Lord, 'cause I... I'm about to explode

Carry your world, I'll carry your world
Carry your world, I'll carry your world

Carry your world, and all your hurt.

(Carry your world, carry your world)
