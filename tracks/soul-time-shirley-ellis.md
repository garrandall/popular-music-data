If you want a time to soul
Baby, it's time to soul time
Say you want a time to soul
Baby, it's time to soul time

We can have a time that's fine
If your time is soul with mine
Then we sing from nine to soul
Baby, we'd be on soul time

Ready, get set, now
Two, four, six, eight, ten
Two, four, six, eight, twenty-two
Two, four, six, eight, ten
Two, four, six, eight, twenty-two

One more time now
Two, four, six, eight, oh
I'm synchronized with you


It's the feeling that gets to you
It's the feeling that gets to me too
Then we can synchronize the soul
Baby, we'll be on soul time

Ready, get set, now
Two, four, six, eight, ten
Two, four, six, eight, twenty-two
Two, four, six, eight, ten
Two, four, six, eight, twenty-two

One more time now
Two, four, six, eight, oh
I'm synchronized with you


Ready, get set, now
Two, four, six, eight, ten
Two, four, six, eight, twenty-two
Four, six, eight, thirty-two
Four, six, eight, forty-two
Four, six, eight, fifty-two
Four, six, eight, sixty-two
Four, six, eight, seventy-two
Four, six, eight, eighty-two
Four, six, eight, ninety-two

Four, six, eight, twenty-two
Four, six, eight, thirty-two
Four, six, eight, forty-two
Four, six, eight, fifty-two
Four, six, eight, sixty-two
Four, six, eight, seventy-two...
