Too late
Am I too late
Too late
Am I too late

Pain is my best friend
Making me think of you again
Waking me up and saying
"Fool, you've been careless and blind, unkind"

Tears I made you shed (look who's crying)
Me, I made this bad (no denying)
I'm the man whose jones
Can't be brought into line

Am I too late to get in the door
Am I too late, have you locked the store
Am I too late to sweep up the floor (too late)
No, no, no, no

Eyes that could not see (what you needed)
Arms that could not be (what you wanted)
Lips that would not say
What you waited to hear, my dear

I'm the one to blame (I admit it)
That and I'm so ashamed (that I did it)
Girl, I'm coming home
It's you I wanna be near (hey, hey, hey)

Am I too late to get in the door
Am I too late, have you locked the store
Am I too late to sweep up the floor

Too late
Am I too late
Too late
Am I too late

Too late, oh-oh-hoo, woo-hoo
Too late, oh-oh-hoo, woo-hoo
Too late, oh-oh-hoo, woo-hoo
Too late, oh-oh-hoo, woo-hoo

(Too late) Can I get in the door
(Too late) Wanna love you some more
(Too late) Can't you see that I'm free
(Too late) Girl, it's love that I need

Girl, I would do anything just for you
If you tell me it isn't too late

Am I too late to get in the door
Am I too late, have you locked the store
Am I too late to sweep up the floor
Girl, I would do anything just for you
If you tell me, yeah

Am I too late to get in the door
Am I too late, have you locked the store
Am I too late to sweep up the floor
Girl, I was wrong, this is where I belong

Am I too late to get in the door
Am I too late
