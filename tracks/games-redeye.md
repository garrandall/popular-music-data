I'm at a space in my mind where I gotta find myself
Talk to God, I need to get him on the line myself
If they stop believing in me, I'ma sign myself
If the team stop working, I'ma grind myself
These people, they'll try to put you through hell
You find yourself in a cell spending life in jail
My life worth way more, but they want us to fail
I swear the city at war, and I don't know what it's for
My soldier just lost his life when I was gone on tour
It's something 'bout the fast life, I guess it's just the allure
She love it
How you try to keep it real then start switching the subject?
I swear this game built off niggas stunting in public
Everybody is a star until they realize that they wasn't
I just do it for the art, that's the reason I love it
That mean it ain't enough money for me to say fuck it
I just signed a new deal and fucked off the budget

(Why? Why? Why? Why?
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?)

Why they make it so hard for the starving artists
That's going hard for the culture and love it regardless
That don't do it for the money, that's not why we started
I just do it for my fans, that's just where my heart is
A lot of niggas come around acting like they all in
But let a nigga go down, they can't even call in
Let some shit go south and you gone find your fake friends
How you gon' put me on the shelf when I gotta make ends?
And make headlines, working, ain't got no bedtime
In the lab in the clouds, and still gotta catch a redeye
Tryna make history, but still gotta meet the deadline
It's something 'bout it, every time feel like the first time
Dear mom, I don't want to see you work none
I'ma make enough to take care me, you, and your first son
I lost my grandma, she was my first love
But girl, I know you watching me, got angels flying all above

(Why? Why? Why? Why?
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?)

Gotta take it slow, that money coming so fast
Gotta take it slow, these hoes coming so fast
Gotta take it slow, them cars driving so fast
I'm caught up in the game, and shit changed so fast

Given the state of the industry, can an artist sustain success working with a smaller label or staying independent?
Yeah, um, you know I think it, it... the metric system or the system for what success is varies from person to person. It depends what you want. There's some people who want to have, you know, ten million singles sold and that's what they look at success as, um
What do you look at?
I mean, I think, I look at... for me, it's being able to touch and affect people in a positive way and have, have music that lasts for a long time. Have a long career, and um, just you know, being able to be influential in, in a positive way
