I remember Sunday morning
I would meet him at the park
We'd walk together hand in hand
'Til it was almost dark
Now I wake up Sunday morning
Walk across the way to find
Nobody waiting for me
Sunday's just another day

Sunday will never be the same
(Sunday will never be the same)
I've lost my Sunday song
He'll not be back again

Sunny afternoons
That make me feel so warm inside
Have turned as cold and gray as ashes
As I feel the embers die
No longer can I walk these paths
For they have changes
I must be home. The sun is gone
And I think it's gonna rain

Sunday will never be the same
(Sunday will never be the same)
I've lost my Sunday song
He'll not be back again

I remember children
Feeding flocks of pigeons
I remember sunshine
And you were mine

Sunday will never be the same
(Sunday will never be the same)
I've lost my Sunday song
He'll not be back again

Sunday will never be the same
Sunday will never be the same
Sunday will never be the same
