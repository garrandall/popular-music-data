Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?
If I should die before I wake
It's cause you took my breath away
Losing you is like living in a world with no air, oh

Chris Brown
I'm here alone, didn't wanna leave
My heart won't move, It's incomplete
If there was a way that I could make you understand

But how do you expect me to live alone with just me?
Cause my world revolves around you, it's so hard for me to breathe

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air, no air

Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gonna breathe without me?
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
There's no air, no air

No air, air
No air, air
No air, air
No air, air

Chris Brown
I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew
Right off the ground To float to you
With no gravity to hold me down for real

But somehow I'm still alive inside
You took my breath but I survived
I don't know how but I don't even care

So how do you expect me to live alone with just me?
Cause my world revolves around you, it's so hard for me to breathe

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air, no air

Got me out here in the water, so deep
Tell me how you gonna breathe without me?
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
There's no air, no air

No air, air
No air, air
No air, air
No air, air

No more
Baby
There's no air, no air
No air, oh!

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?
I can't live, I can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air, no air

Got me out here in the water, so deep
Tell me how you gonna breathe without me?
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
There's no air, no air

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?
I can't live, I can't breathe with no air
That's how I feel whenever you ain't there
There's no air, no air

Got me out here in the water, so deep
Tell me how you gonna breathe without me?
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
There's no air, no air

No air, air
No air, air
No air, air
No air
