Yeah, just like that
Ah-ha-ha-ha
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh...hoo...hoo...

(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Yeah, yeah

When Iâm with you, I hear a sound
That makes me laugh and smile and sing to you
When Iâm with you, I feel so free
I love that love is going to take control of me

When Iâm with you
Itâs for real (Itâs for real)
What I feel (What I feel)
When Iâm with you (You), uh-huh

When Iâm with you, I wonder why
People do stop and stare and smile at us
When Iâm with you, the sun shines my way
Baby, our love reflects its rays of light on everyone in the world

When Iâm with you
Itâs for real (Itâs for real)
What I feel (What I feel)
When Iâm with you (You), Hey, hey, hey

Uh-huh (Special touch, a warm embrace)
A sweet and tender, your smile, whoa
Body warm my heart, so pure
Chills when I look, look in your eyes

I wonder why
People (Do stop) and stare (And stare and smile at us) and smile at us
When Iâm with you, the sun shines my way
Baby, our love reflects its rays of light on everyone in the world

When Iâm with you
Itâs for real (Itâs for real)

What I feel (What I feel)
When Iâm with you (You), you, hey, hey, hey

Oh, girl
I love you, baby
Ye-ye-ye-yes, I do
Ye-ye-ye-yes, I do
Iâd give the world to you, baby
Oh...whoa...oh, yeah

When Iâm with you, whoa...baby
Itâs for real (Itâs for real)
What I feel (What I feel)
When Iâm with you (You), yeah, yeah, eah, hey

Everything, everythingâs alright
When Iâm with you
Itâs for real (Itâs for real, what I feel)
What I feel (Youâre heavy on my mind)
Itâs okay (Itâs okay, gonna pray)
Every day (Every day)
Itâs so nice (So nice), so right now (So right)
When Iâm with you (You), nobody but you
Honey, I love you, yeah, ooh
