Crazy how it feels tonight 
Crazy how you make it all alright love 
You crush me with the things you do 
I do for you anything too 
Sitting smoking feeling high 
In this moment it feels so right 
Lovely lady 
I am at your feet 
God I want you so badly 
I wonder this 
Could tomorrow be 
So wondrous as you there sleeping 
Let's go drive 'till morning comes 
Watch the sunrise to fill our souls up 
Drink some wine 'till we get drunk 
It's crazy I'm thinking 
Just knowing that the world is round 
Here I'm dancing on the ground 
Am I right side up or upside down 
Is this real or am I dreaming 
Lovely lady 
Let me drink you please 
I won't spill a drop I promise you 
Lying under this spell you cast on me 
Each moment 
The more I love you 
Crush me 
Come on 
It's crazy I'm thinking 
Just knowing that the world is round 
Here I'm dancing on the ground 
Am I right side up or upside down 
Is it real or am I dreaming 
Lovely lady 
I will treat you sweetly 
Adore you I mean you crush me 
It's times like these 
When my faith I feel 
And I know how I love you 
Come on 
Lady 
It's crazy I'm thinking 
Just as long as you're around 
And here I'll be dancing on the ground 
Am I right side up or upside down 
To each other we'll be facing 
By love we'll beat back the pain we've found 
You know 
I mean to tell you all the things I've been thinking deep inside 
My friend 
With each moment the more I love you 
Crush me 
Come on 
So much you have given love 
That I would give you back again and again 
Meaning I'll hold you 
And please let me always
