(Shutters and boards cover the windows)
(Of the house where we used to live)


Shutters and boards cover the windows
Of the house where we used to live
All I have left is a heart full of sorrow
Since she said she'd never forgive

The house that we built was once filled with laughter
But I changed that laughter to tears
And now I live in a world without sunshine
Oh, how I wish you were here


Last night I dreamed that you came to our house
To take an old book from the shelf
If you'll open the shutters, I'll tear down the boards
'Cause I drove every nail by myself


One more time!


Shutters and boards
