I always thought I was doing fine
Spreading myself around another good time
Then it hit me from out of the blue
I was falling in love with you

But now everythings been changed
My hopes my dreams
Are rearranged it's true
And it's all because of you
My baby

(chorus)
I'll be loving you all my life
Til my dying day is through
I'll be loving you
Forever(2x)

Every night I wonder if you know
No matter what they say
I won't let go
Don't ask yourself if I'll always be there
Cause forever's how long I'll care

As time goes by and the feeling gets stronger
To be in your arms can't wait any longer
Look in my eyes
And see it's true
Day and night
All my thoughts are of you

(chorus)
