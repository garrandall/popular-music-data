Winchester Cathedral
You're bringin' me down
You stood and you watched as
My baby left town
You could have done something
But you didn't try
You didn't do nothing
You let him walk by
Now everyone knows just how much I needed a guy
He wouldn't have gone far away if only you started ringing your bell
Winchester Cathedral
You're bringin' me down
You stood and you watched as
My baby left town
