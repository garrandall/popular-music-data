Standing in the midnight rain
All Alone with the pieces of my heart again
Knowing one of is right and one of is is gone
Into another night
You've gone running all alone
All alone into another night
You've gone running all alone

I 've still got these feelings left
Living in my heart and in my head
Breaking from the past I've come to know at last
Only a fool would stay
Stay and pretend
Only a fool would stay
Stay and pretend

I need you more than anyone
Or anything under the sun
Don't leave me lonely here
I get so lonely here

Standing in the midnight rain
All Alone with the pieces of my heart again
Knowing one of is right and one of is is gone
Into another night
You've gone running all alone
All alone into another night
You've gone running all alone
