It's just another daydream
The kids'll be okay
It's just another detour
They haven't lost their way
They're lookin' for the lights
Somewhere they're shining
Lookin' for the lights
Oh... oh
Lookin' for the lights
That silver lining
Lookin' for the lights
Oh... oh
Sometimes you hate it
Sometimes you love it
Sometimes you don't know
What to think of it
Nobody said it was easy
Nobody said it was
Nobody said it was easy
Nobody said it
Now is no time to give up
Some they love the money
Some they love the fame
Some they don't love anything at all
I don't know why they came
Lookin' for the lights
Somewhere they're shining
Lookin' for the lights
Oh... oh
Lookin' for the lights
That silver lining
Lookin' for the lights
Oh... oh
Sometimes you hate it
Sometimes you love it
Sometimes you don't know
What to think of it
Nobody said it was easy
Nobody said it was
Nobody said it was easy
Nobody said it
Now is no time to give up

Nobody said it was easy
Nobody said it was
Nobody said it was easy
Nobody said it
Now is no time to give up
Nobody said it was easy
Nobody said it was
Nobody said it was easy
Nobody said it
Don't you give up
Don't you give up
Don't you give up
Don't you give up
Don't you give up
Don't you give up
Don't you give up
Don't you give up
