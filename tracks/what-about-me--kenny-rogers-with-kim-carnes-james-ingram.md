I see you here with me
I've waited all my life
For someone like you
Someone to give
My heart and soul to

I look into your eyes
Your love for me
Was such a welcome surprise
I think at last
I've found forever

But what about me
(I'll always love you)
Oh, what about me
(I'll always need you)

You were my love before
But I need so much more of you

Time after time
I feel I'm losing my mind
Or maybe this is what
Lovers must go through

It never entered my mind
We could be wasting our time
What am I gonna do

What about me
Oh, what about me

No reason to pretend
True love affairs don't
Have to come to an end
The moment we don't
Have all the answers

I nearly go insane
(Oh, I go insane)
Each and every time
I hear you whisper my name
I feel the same
When I'm around you

(But what about me)
I'll always love you
(Oh, what about me)
I'll always need you

This is so hard for me
I wanted so much to be
With you, whoa

Time after time
I feel I'm losing my mind
Or maybe this is what
Lovers must go through

It never entered my mind
We could be wasting our time
What am I gonna do

Time after time
I'm losing my mind

It never entered my mind
We could be wasting our time

But what about me
