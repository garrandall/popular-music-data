My house in Budapest
My, my hidden treasure chest
Golden grand piano
My beautiful Castillo

You
Oh, you
Oh, I'd leave it all

My acres of a land
That I've achieved
It may be hard for you to
Stop and believe

But for you
Oh, you
Oh, I'd leave it all

Oh, for you
Oh, you
Oh, I'd leave it all

And give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And baby if you hold me
Then all of this will go away

My many artifacts
The list goes on
If you just say the words
I'll, I'll up and run

Oh, to you
Oh, you
Oh, I'd leave it all

Oh, for you
Oh, oh
Oh, I'd leave it all

And give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
Baby if you hold me
Then all of this will go away

Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And baby if you hold me
Then all of this will go away

A-oh, a-oh

My friends and family
They don't understand
They fear they'll lose so much
If you take my hand

But, for you
Oh, you
Oh, I'd lose it all

Oh, for you
Oh, you
Oh, I'd lose it all

And give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And baby if you hold me
Then all of this will go away

Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And baby if you hold me
Then all of this will go away

My house in Budapest
My, my hidden treasure chest
Golden grand piano
My beautiful Castillo

You
Oh, you
Oh, I'd leave it all

Oh, for you
Oh, you
Oh, I'd leave it all
