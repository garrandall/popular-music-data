I give her measure
I give her hurt
What I want
I want dessert
I believe in me
That's how I live
I'm gonna take her
And you're gonna give

Girl, I'm gonna make you mine
I'm gonna make you mine
I want you bad, so be prepared
Girl, I'm gonna make you mine

You've got something so out-of-sight
But now you've opened my appetite
Girl don't say no
Don't use that word
I'll make believe
That I, I never heard

Girl, I'm gonna make you mine
I'm gonna make you mine
I want you bad, so be prepared
Girl, I'm gonna make you mine

I believe in me
That's how I live
I'm gonna take her
And you're gonna give

Girl, I'm gonna make you mine
I'm gonna make you mine
I want you bad, so be prepared
Girl, I'm gonna make you mine
I'm gonna make you mine
I'm gonna make you mine
Umm, yeah
Watch out girl, gonna make you
Mine
