I found true love, one worth waitin' for
I found true love, one worth waitin' for
I'm gonna sign it to a contract, you won't find one little flaw

It's hard to believe the condition the world is in
It's hard to believe the condition the world is in
You can't trust nobody and girl, you know it's a sin

I found true love, one worth me waitin' for
I found true love, one worth me waitin' for
And I'll sign it to a contract, you won't find one little flaw
