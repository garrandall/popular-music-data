Ooh, I need your love, babe
Guess you know it's true
Hope you need my love, babe
Just like I need you


Hold me, love me

Love you everyday, girl
Always on my mind
One thing I can say girl
Love you all the time


Hold me, love me
Hold me, love me
I ain't got nothing but love, girl

Eight days a week
Is not enough to show I care
