Green light, Seven Eleven 
You stop in for a pack of cigarettes 
You don't smoke, don't even want to 
Hey now, check your change 
Dressed up like a car crash 
Your wheels are turning but you're upside down 
You say when he hits you, you don't mind 
Because when he hurts you, you feel alive 
Hey babe, is that what it is 

Red lights, gray morning 
You stumble out of a hole in the ground 
A vampire or a victim 
It depend's on who's around 
You used to stay in to watch the adverts 
You could lip synch to the talk shows 

And if you look, you look through me 
And when you talk, you talk at me 
And when I touch you, you don't feel a thing 

If I could stay... 
Then the night would give you up 
Stay...and the day would keep its trust 
Stay...and the night would be enough 

Faraway, so close 
Up with the static and the radio 
With satelite television 
You can go anywhere 
Miami, New Orleans 
London, Belfast and Berlin 

And if you listen I can't call 
And if you jump, you just might fall 
And if you shout, I'll only hear you 

If I could stay... 
Then the night would give you up 
Stay...then the day would keep its trust 
Stay...with the demons you drowned 
Stay...with the spirit I found 
Stay...and the night would be enough 

Three o'clock in the morning 
It's quiet and there's no one around 
Just the bang and the clatter 
As an angel runs to ground 

Just the bang 
And the clatter 
As an angel 
Hits the ground
