This is how it started, rather how it all began,
You see, I was an ugly duckling, only half a man,
I didn't think I would find a girl,
The kind that would rock my world,
So I kept on searchin', always felt the hurtin',

Temptation got the best of me,
Temptation said, boy be who you want to be,
So I started, chargin' by the hour, for my love power,
And then, me-myself and I, a regular lady's guy,

Sittin' in the lap, sittin' in the lap,
Sittin' in the lap of luxury, sure feels good to me.
Sittin' in the lap, sittin' in the lap,
Sittin' in the lap of luxury, sure feels good to me.

Luxury found me, in just the nick of time,
I was runnin' out of patience, on my last dime,
A magical shower in the middle of the day,
She turned out my senses, washed my blues away.

Luxury got the best of me,
Luxury said boy be who you want to be,
I never charged her by the hour, my love power,
I love her big green eyes, I'll always stand beside her.

Sittin' in the lap, sittin' in the lap,
Sittin' in the lap of luxury, sure feels good to me.
Sittin' in the lap, sittin' in the lap,
Sittin' in the lap of luxury, sure feels good to me.

It don't matter how we met, where we slept,
Who we knew before,
I'm your Romeo, you're Juliet,
There's nothing I want more
Than to honor you, cherish you,
Tell me what you have got to lose,
The moral of the story is gigolos,
Gigolos get lonely too.
