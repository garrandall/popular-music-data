Dead star shine 
Light up the sky 
I'm all out of breath 
My walls are closing in 
Days go by 
Give me a sign 
Come back to the end 
The shepherd of the damned 

I can feel you falling away 

No longer the lost 
No longer the same 
And I can see you starting to break 
I'll keep you alive 
If you show me the way 
Forever - and ever 
the scars will remain 
I'm falling apart 
Leave me here forever in the dark 

Daylight dies 
Blackout the sky 
Does anyone care? 
Is anybody there? 
Take this life 
Empty inside 
I'm already dead 
I'll rise to fall again 

I can feel you falling away 

No longer the lost 
No longer the same 
And I can see you starting to break 
I'll keep you alive 
If you show me the way 
Forever - and ever 
the scars will remain 
I'm falling apart 
Leave me here forever in the dark 

God help me I've come undone 
Out of the light of the sun 
God help me I've come undone 
Out of the light of the sun 

I can feel you falling away 

No longer the lost 
No longer the same 
And I can see you starting to break 
I'll keep you alive 
If you show me the way 
Forever - and ever 
the scars will remain 

Give me a sign 
There's something buried in the words 
Give me a sign 
Your tears are adding to the flood 
Just give me a sign 
there's something buried in the words 
Give me a sign 
Your tears are adding to the flood 
Just give me a sign 
There's something buried in the words 
Give me a sign 
Your tears are adding to the flood 

Forever - and ever 
The scars will remain
