Have you ever been awaken by the crowing of a rooster
While the night is still heavy on the ground
And the voice of Uncle Ben seems to break the morning silence
Bringing lights to windows all around
Well it's time to rise and shine and start another hard work day
Get the cows in and start the milking chores
It's nice to think about it maybe even visit but I wonder could I live there anymore

Something bout the smell of cornbread cooking on a wood stove
Seems to bring a picture to my mind
Of a little three room house with mama in the kitchen
But she can't stop to talk ain't got the time
She's a fixing dad his supper he's a working over time
Tryin' to pay our bill at the grocery store
It's nice to think about it maybe even visit but I wonder could I live there anymore

As I think about my childhood and of my old hometown
I don't really miss them like before
It's nice to think about it maybe even visit but I wonder could I live there anymore
