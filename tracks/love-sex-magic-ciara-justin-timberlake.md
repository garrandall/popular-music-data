1, 2, 3, go
Ciara
Sex
Ciara
Here we go
Talk to me


Your touch is so magic to me
The strangest things can happen
The way that you react to me
I wanna do something you can't imagine, imagine

If there was a million mes talking sexy to you like that
You think you can handle, boy
If I give you my squeeze
And I need you to push it right back


Baby show me, show me
What's your favorite trick
That you wanna use on me
And I'll volunteer
And I'll be flowing and going
'Til clothing disappears
Ain't nothing but shoes on me
Oh baby


All-night show
Just you and the crowd doing tricks you never seen
And I bet that I can make you believe in love and sex and magic
So let me drive my body around you
I bet you know what I mean
'Cause you know that I can make you believe in love and sex and magic


Everything ain't what it seems
I wave my hands and I got you
And you feel so fly assist in me
But now it's my turn to watch you
I ain't gon' stop you

If you wanna grab my neck
Talk sexy to me like that
Just do what I taught you girl
When I give you my heat
And I need you to push it right back


Baby show me, show me
What's your favorite trick
That you wanna use on me
And I'll volunteer
And I'll be flowing and going
'Til clothing disappears
Ain't nothing but shoes on me
Oh baby


All-night show
Just you and the crowd doing tricks you never seen
And I bet that I can make you believe in love and sex and magic
So let me drive my body around you
I bet you know what I mean
'Cause you know that I can make you believe in love and sex and magic (breakdown)


Now this is the part where we fall in love (sugar)
Let's slow it down so we fall in love
But don't stop whatcha doing to me

Ciara
Bring it back


All-night show
Just you and the crowd doing tricks you never seen
And I bet that I can make you believe in love and sex and magic
So let me drive my body around you
I bet you know what I mean
'Cause you know that I can make you believe in love and sex and magic


All-night show
Just you and the crowd doing tricks you never seen
And I bet that I can make you believe in love and sex and magic
So let me drive my body around you
I bet you know what I mean
'Cause you know that I can make you believe in love and sex and magic

I see you on the floor
Get it girl
Love, sex and magic
I see you on the floor
You know what I mean
Get it girl
I bet that I can make you believe in love and sex and magic
I see you on the floor
Get it girl
