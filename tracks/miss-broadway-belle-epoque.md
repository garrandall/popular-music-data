Well, I'm gonna get a job 'cause I need the bread
But somehow I know it's gonna affect my head
Wanna buy fine dresses and a fancy car
So I better go out looking for my lucky star

Money buys
Money buys

Hey, Miss Broadway, you're walking up and down
You got caught in the next by the underground
For fame and fortune you gave your body away
And you were forced into action the next day

Money buys
Money buys

If we're all in together won't you realize
If we want to break down we'd better compromize
Don't let days of small kind get loose
By makin' him the offer he can't refuse

Hey, Miss Broadway
Hey, Miss Broadway
Hey, Miss Broadway
Hey, Miss Broadway

Money buys
Money buys

Buy your ticket for a square yard in the sun
Buy your right of living far from a gun
Watch out 'cause if you make a wrong deal you'll see how it feels
You may miss out on your next meal

Money buys
Money buys

Aha, I like it, aha, I like it
Aha, I like it, aha, I like it
Aha, I like it, aha, I like it
Aha, I like it, aha, I like it

Aha, I like it, aha, I like it

The gambler won't get out before he's lost it all
The junkie always knows where to call
Hey, Miss Broadway, is your lover's money clean
You know what I mean?
Where is his connection with the underground scene?

So, so, so, money buys
Money buys
