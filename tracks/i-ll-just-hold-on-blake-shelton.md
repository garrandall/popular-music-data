I can taste your kiss on my lips
And I'm wrapped around your finger tips
As I watch the moonlight dancing on your skin
Your green eyes and the sweet red wine
Go to my head girl every time
And I get drunk on you
I lose control and then
And here I go again


I'm falling for you even though I know your only playing with my heart
Tomorrow might be hell
But a night or two of loving you is better than never at all
And I can't help myself
So I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
Until you’re gone


Girl I know you're a gypsy soul
And I'm just a stop along your road
And you hang around long enough to blow my mind
If I had a star for every scar
You tattooed on my heart
I could fill up the Oklahoma sky
So girl I don't know why


I'm falling for you even though I know your only playing with my heart
Tomorrow might be hell
But a night or two of loving you is better than never at all
And I can't help myself
So I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
Until you’re gone

I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
Till you’re gone


I look down and my cell phone rings
And I see your name and I know what that means
But I don't care
I'll just hold on
Till your gone

Every time you need to take it home?
Seeing you there just breaks my heart?
I don't care
I'll just hold on
Till you’re gone

Your green eyes and that sweet red wine
Go to my head girl every time
But I don't care
I'll just hold on
Till you’re gone
