Day after day
Just thinking about you
I can't wait to see your smiling face
Could this be love
I'm feeling for you
I've never felt this way before

I made a wish upon a shooting star
And baby here you are, just you and me
That's the way it should be
My heart is waiting, it's an open door
Each day I'm gonna love you more
Of this I'm sure
That's the way I feel about you


Bye bye cloudy days
Sunshine's here to stay
Tell the world
That's the way I feel about you
Happy days are here
Whenever you're near
This is clear
That's the way I feel about you

I'm so satisfied with you in my life
You're everything I've dreamed of
Oh and it feels so good when I'm in your arms
Nothing seems to matter as long as you're lovin' me

I made a wish upon a shooting star
And baby here you are, just you and me
That's the way it should be
My heart is waiting, it's an open door
Each day I'm gonna love you more
Of this I'm sure
That's the way I feel about you



The way I feel about you
The way I feel about you

Every time you hold me in your arms
I look into your eyes and I see happiness
And my heart just can't deny what I'm feelin'
I love what you do when you do all the things
That you do to me
