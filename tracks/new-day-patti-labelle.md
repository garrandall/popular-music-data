Seems my life is finally coming together
Feels so good, Don't think I've ever been better
It's clear to me
My future will bring
The piece I've been longing for is mine
Forever more


It's a New Day
Open my eyes and my path is clearer
New Day
Pushing ahead till my goal is nearer
New Day
Spread my wings
I'm doin things my way
It's a New Day

I don't know, where I should begin
Couldnt my tell my begining, from the ends
For every door that close, a window opens
And round the world and back again

It starts from within, yeah



I'm excited for the things ahead of me
I've decited I can make it my own
Embrace the good and bad
And let go of the past
I'm loving whats inside of me



I decited long ago
I can make it on my own
Gonna be allright yeah
Gonna be allright yeah



Gonna be allright yeah
