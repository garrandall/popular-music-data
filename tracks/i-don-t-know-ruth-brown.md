Should I let myself go
In his direction
Is his love strong enough
For my heart's protection

I don't know
(I don't know, I don't know)
I don't know
(I don't know, I don't know)

But he loves me so good
Til I think I should, oh, oh

If I gave him my heart
Would he refuse it
Would he tear it apart
Or tenderly use it

I don't know
(I don't know, I don't know)
I don't know
(I don't know, I don't know)

But he hugs me so tight
Til I think I might, oh, oh

When he crushes my eager lips
My heart starts doing flips
Whenever I feel his touch
I get a thrill that's much too much
Too much, too much, too much

Could a heart so right
Be led so wrong
If his love is weak
Would it last this long

I don't know
(I don't know, I don't know)
I don't know
(I don't know, I don't know)

But I hope and pray
That he comes my way, oh, oh
But I hope and pray
That he comes my way, oh, oh
But I hope and pray
That he comes my way, oh, oh
