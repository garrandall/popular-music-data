And Lil Metro on that beat

Lil Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in a penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, "Boy, make a decision."
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
Lil Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in a penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, "Boy, make a decision."
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
They sendin' all my homies on a mission
And I ain't tryna miss out on these millions

I jumped out of that Wraith, Kodak bought a Wraith
I get any girl I want, any girl I want
She want me to save the day, but I ain't got a cape
She wanna see me every day, she wanna be my bae
That money make me cum. It made me fornicate
Uh, I'm the shit, I need some toilet paper
Follow my player rules then we gon' be okay
On the real, I need a bih' who gon' cooperate

Lil Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in a penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, "Boy, make a decision."
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
Lil Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in a penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, "Boy, make a decision."
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
They sendin' all my homies on a mission
And I ain't tryna miss out on these millions

I told you niggas, I'm gon' be that fuckin' nigga
Everything be good 'til you doin' better than 'em
They wanna see a nigga shot or see me in the system
All you niggas out here poison like snake venom
Codeine in my liver, rockin' Balenciaga denim
I'm booted even when I'm sober, I don't need a jigga
They sendin' all my niggas on a fuckin' journey
I told that baby to come over 'cause I'm fucking horny
My mama told me, "Kill these niggas, son. Keep it going."
I'm thug to the bone, but I'm still her baby boy
Lil Kodak, boy, they hate to see you in a foreign
They miss when you was in that 'Yota kickin' door

Lil Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in a penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, "Boy, make a decision."
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
Lil Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in a penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, "Boy, make a decision."
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
They sendin' all my homies on a mission
And I ain't tryna miss out on these millions
