Iâm so serious!


One, two them boys coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, hide your bitch
(Ayo Yeezy, pop your shit)


They said, thou shall not be ill
Thou shall not feel
Thou should not be trill, not be drill, not be real
Niggas selling packs, niggas flipping pills
They got heroin and cracks, man these niggas high for real
Every year gon be our year
Every year gon be my year
These niggas really is out here
These niggas really is out here
The block is at war
Post traumatic stress
Ran up outta pills
Rob that CVS
Niggas getting bust over In Godâs We Trust
We believe in God but do God believe in us
If we believe enough, will we ever get to know âim
That lean got us dozing, we forget that we the chosen
Iâve been poppin shit for too long
But still reppinâ where I came from
I guess itâs how I came up
I wish you would try to play us


I wish you would nigga
I wish you would nigga
I wish you would nigga
I wish you would nigga
I guess itâs how I came up
I wish you would try to play us


My money on a another level
In the streets I hear âem hotter than the fucking devil
I wonder how I got a hundred in my fucking bezel
G5, make it rain, I can change the weather
We fly, them niggas lame, where your fucking cheddar?
Aim at your brain, AK be the fucking letters
Fuck niggas fall in alphabetical order
Frank Lucas fur, the cap run more than the quarter
Iâm at the fight, ringside, right next to promoters
All my niggas still hustle consider âem roguish
I remember catching buses just bought me a Lotus
All your codes get decoded, know the niggas you quoting
Hunh, my corner will scorch ya
Somehow my flow is the coldest
Money, power, respect, the only thingâs truly important
Family first, Khaled we gotta stay focused
God Forgives and I donât
Pussy niggas unnoticed




I wish you would nigga, I wish you would nigga
You see you got a couple cases, still look good nigga
You see these niggasâll try to play ya
Know how ya feel nigga
Eh yup, thatâd be the day you wanna kill a nigga
But you gon chill nigga
Just for your kids nigga
Cause now thereâs kids doing grown man biz nigga
You just got home nigga
You tryna live nigga
Me I donât wanna do another 5 years nigga
The boss is testing yo ass
The fedsâll question yo ass
They be drug testinâ yo ass
And then they pray you donât pass
And then you look in the sky
You got some questions to ask
With no response make you wanna grab the tech and the mac
Cause theyâve been poppinâ shit for too long
Still reppinâ where I came from
I guess itâs how I came up
I wish you would try to play us


(ROZAY!)
