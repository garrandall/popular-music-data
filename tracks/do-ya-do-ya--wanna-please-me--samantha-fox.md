Are you strong enough?
Give me what I want! Can you please me right now
Are you strong enough?
Give me what I want! Can you please me right now
Come on -
So you know my name
Now you know my number
Don't the others want you anymore?
If you're gonna call you'll see I'm stronger
Stronger than the girls you had before!
Well do you know how to please?
Do ya
Do ya
Wanna please me
Do ya
Do ya
Wanna please me
Do ya
Do ya
Wanna please
Please me now
Oh
Oh
Oh
Do ya
Do ya
Wanna please me
Do ya
Do ya
Wanna please me
Do ya
Do ya
Wanna please
Please me now
Oh
Oh
Oh
Tell me how it feels
Now the table's turning
I could get you underneath my thumb
Have you got a heart? Is your heart burning?
Tell me is it pounding like a drum?
Well do you know how to please? . .
Please - please -
Give me what I want
Give me what I need
Give me what I want
Give me what I need
Give me what I want
Give me what I need
Give me what I want
Give me what I need
Well do you know how to please? . .
Do ya
Do ya
Wanna please me
Do ya
Do ya
Wanna please me . .
