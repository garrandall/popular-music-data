Girl you got me to fall in love with you
Though I'm not free to fall in love with you
Oh, baby
Why did I have to get so hung on you
Tell me
Why did I have to get so hung on you

Believe me, baby
I didn't plan it this way
I thought I'd see you one night and
Forget you the next day

You're not the girl that I belong to
And even though I know it's wrong to
There's a little place where we can go
Where we won't run into a soul we know

Whoa, baby, baby
Well I wish I could get you out of my heart
Then I could also get you out of my life
Baby
Why did I have to get so hung on you
Tell me
Why did I have to get so hung on you

Sure I could tell you it's over and then
One day I'd call you and beg you to see me again
This is a fine mess I got myself in
And let me tell you baby, you're not helping
You know the changes I'm going through
And still you look at me the way you do

Cause you got me to fall in love with you
Though I'm not free to fall in love with you
Baby, baby
Why did I have to get so hung on you
I want to know
Why did I have to get so hung on you
