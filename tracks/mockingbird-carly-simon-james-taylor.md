Everybody have you heard
He's gonna buy me a mockingbird
And if that mockingbird don't sing
He's gonna buy me a diamond ring
And if that diamond ring won't shine
He's gonna surely break this heart of mine
And that's why I keep on tellin' everybody...

Hear me now and understand
He's gonna find me some piece of mind
And if that piece of mind won't stay
I'm gonna find myself a better way
And if that better way ain't so
I'll ride with the tide and go with the flow
And that's why I keep on shoutin' in your ear...

Everybody have you heard
She's gonna buy me a mockingbird
And if that mockingbird don't sing
She's gonna buy me a diamond ring
And if that diamond ring won't shine
Gonna surely break this heart of mine
And that's the reason why I keep on tellin' everybody...

Listen now and understand
She's gonna find me some piece of mind
And if that piece of mind won't stay
I'm gonna get myself a better way
I might rise above, I might go below
Ride with the tide and go with the flow
And that's the reason why I keep on shouting in your ear...
