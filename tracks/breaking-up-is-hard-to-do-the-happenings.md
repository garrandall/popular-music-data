Oh, oh
Broken heart
I got a broken heart, I got a broken one
(PlayBoy on this bitch, but he ain't playin' though)

I had a broken heart
But I sit back, went bought a push-to-start
I can't fake the feeling, this my character
Pretty bad bitch up in my passenger
While I'm smashing her

Feeling myself please, saw some bad, I done flashed out
Police got no tint, fishbowl, don't let the windows down
Pickin' up my chin 'cause I'm thankful when I'm feeling down
Won't stop goin' in 'til I'm wealthy and my money long
I'm flooded all over, my VVS's dipped in water
They depend on Lil Jay so I just been goin' harder
I been tryna dodge the system so I just been payin' lawyers
Bitch, I just wanna ball, be rich as fuck just like I'm Steve Harvey
My problems old so they gon' rot and they gon' turn 'em over
Keep the jean jacket in the heat, that's where my burner go
Look, I'm back to back with the hits, I make the summer cold
How the fuck am I gon' get rich? That's what I wanna know

I had a broken heart
But I sit back, went bought a push-to-start
I can't fake the feeling, this my character
Pretty bad bitch up in my passenger
While I'm smashing her
I had a broken heart
But I sit back, went bought a push-to-start
I can't fake the feeling, this my character
Pretty bad bitch up in my passenger
While I'm smashing her

I been tryna shake back
Just wanna count up in the Maybach
They don't let me breathe, bitch, where the space at?
Pull up beaucoup weed 'cause I don't got patience
I just hate it
I know I know right but I don't know why I still choose to do wrong
Free Jimmy in Detroit, it fucked me up how he had to go on that chose
They say I used to be smart but I'm loyal as fuck, I know my brains toes
I'm just living it up like what a feeling, I done hit the road
My heart went black (My heart went black)
'Bout to feel depressed but I'm not having that (Not having that)
I'm number than a bitch so where the happenings at? (Where the happen at?)
I'm speakin' from the soul, is you feelin' this shit? (Is you feelin' this?)
I'm just swag in this bitch

I had a broken heart
But I sit back, went bought a push-to-start
I can't fake the feeling, this my character
Pretty bad bitch up in my passenger
While I'm smashing her
I had a broken heart
But I sit back, went bought a push-to-start
I can't fake the feeling, this my character
Pretty bad bitch up in my passenger
While I'm smashing her

Da-da-da-da
Oh-ooh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
