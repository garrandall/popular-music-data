Breaking up is hard to do...

Don't take your love away from me
Don't you leave my heart in misery.
If you go then I'll be blue
Cause breakin' up is hard to do.

Remember when you held me tight
And you kissed me all through the night
Think of all that we've been through
Cause breakin' up is hard to do.

They say that breakin' up is hard to do.
Now I know
I know that it's true.
Don't say that this is the end.
Instead of breakin' up
I wish that we were makin' up again.

I beg of you don't say goodbye
Won't you give our love another try?
Come on baby, let's start anew
Cause breakin' up is hard to do.
