Bentley truck, yeah that's my choice of ride (skrrt skrrt)
Always keep some bitches on the side, yeah yeah
Don't stand too close, my diamonds gonna bite (bling)
I get drugs for the right price, yeah yeah (drugs)
She gon' eat this Molly like it's rice (eat it up)
I'mma let that lean flow through my ice (lean lean)
Said she never had a Migo night
I'mma make her sing like Kelly Price (sing!)


My ice, Klondike, ride around, dough right
Ride around, get right, get rich, good night, oh, good night, you know (good night)
My bitch for real, she honest, won't tell
Popeye's oat meals, Popeye's and oatmeal
She gon' kill (pew pew pew pew pew)
I go through all the cities (yeah)
I'm on a mile a minute
I go a mile a minute (skrrt)
You wanna play violent, let's get it (yeah)
Take me back to the old days
Take me back to my old ways
Lifestyle, yeah the gang way
Way before they called me Sensei
Get robbed in the driveway
Bad bitches they was not here
You were probably watching Garfield
Tunnel vision, and nothing else
Kick door, that's on our face
I done walk in the hallway
Basketball then gunplay (prrr)
Young niggas didn't graduate
You probably think I couldn't make it (I made it)
It's all good God saved me (God)
Now I'm doin' what I wanna
Bentley truck bent the corner (skrrt skrrt, skrrt, skrrt skrrt)
Niggas bite like piranhas
If I gotta put the bag on 'em, I'mma pay 'em all hundreds


Bentley truck, yeah that's my choice of ride (choice of ride yeah)
Always keep some bitches on the side, yeah yeah
Don't stand too close, my diamonds gonna bite (gonna bite ya)
I get drugs for the right price, yeah yeah
She gon' eat this Molly like it's rice, yeah
I'mma let that lean flow through my ice
Said she never had a Migo night
I'mma make her sing like Kelly Price (sing!)


Flash, dash (Straight up!)
Treat the Bentley truck like a Jag
Got the red and blues on my ass
Got lethal narcs, lethal darts
My bitch got lethal parts, a lethal heart
All my furniture same color, Molly tan
You wanna go to heaven, grab my hand
(Grab my hand)
She gon' suck me dry until we land (yeah!)
I'mma call ol' squad like what's the plans? (it's lit!)
We been rocking, geeking, going all night (skrrt skrrt)
Treat my Lambo like a Fisher Price, yeah yeah
I can never let her spend the night
Woke up, cocaine all in my hair, thought it was lice, yeah yeah
(Straight up!)


Bentley truck, yeah that's my choice of ride (choice of ride yeah)
Always keep some bitches on the side, yeah yeah (yeah)
Don't stand too close, my diamonds gonna bite (gonna bite ya)
I get drugs for the right price, yeah yeah (drugs)
She gon' eat this Molly like it's rice, yeah
I'mma let that lean flow through my ice
Said she never had a Migo night
I'mma make her sing like Kelly Price (sing!)


No key push button auto, start my ride
Two piece chicken wing without the fries
If I pop the seal and drink it you gon' drive
If you let me in and I like, I change your life
Back it up back it up back it up alright
We go try something different just for tonight (Try)
Tear the tab and I paid the price (price)
Just take me there I might roll the dice (ah)
With a blindfold I could still whip up a pie (pie)
Never leave and go nowhere without the fire (prrr)
If you cashed out on that Bentley Truck say I (I)
Plus another car that's on my eye


Bentley truck, yeah that's my choice of ride (choice of ride yeah)
Always keep some bitches on the side, yeah yeah
Don't stand too close, my diamonds gonna bite (gonna bite ya)
I get drugs for the right price, yeah yeah (drugs)
She gon' eat this Molly like it's rice
I'mma let that lean flow through my ice
Said she never had a Migo night
I'mma make her sing like Kelly Price


My choice of ride (my choice of ride)
My choice of ride (my choice of ride)
Yeah yeah
She gon' eat this Molly like it's rice, yeah
I'mma make her sing, sing like Kelly Price yeah (whooo)
(I just can't understand her

She drive, I drive hours, I always drive, I drive for you
I black out, I black out too
