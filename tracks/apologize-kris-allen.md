I'm holdin' on your rope, got me ten feet off the ground
I'm hearin' what you're saying, but I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait

Tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around and say that
It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

I'd take another chance, take a fall, take a shot for you
And I need you like a heart needs a beat, it's nothin' new
I loved you with a fire red, now it's turnin' blue, and you say
Sorry like the angel, heaven let me think was you, but I'm afraid

It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late
It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah

I'm holdin' on your rope, got me ten feet off the ground
