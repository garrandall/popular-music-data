To just act like we never were
To come around and not show hurt
How dare we greet by shaking hands
Just months ago, I was your man, was your man

Verbally we'd agreed it was over
And we were through
I'm trying to compose myself
But I just can't get over you, girl

We can't be friends
(Yeah, no oh)
We can't be friends
(Deborah, you know I can't go on being just your friend, yeah)
We can't be friends
Cuz I'm still in love with you


I went by mother's, saw your car there
To her you're still family
And it don't seem fair
For everyone to just go on
And I've tried and I can't do it
Cuz I'm still torn

I tried to think of you as just another love
In my past that didn't last
But it's not that simple, baby

We can't be friends
(oh no, no, no, no)
We can't be friends
(If we, if we can't be lovers)
We can't be friends
Cuz I'm still in love with you


You may see me staring
Or catch me in a daze
May see me hang my head
When you come my way
Don't get too close to me
And expect me to behave

 I might just steal a kiss
 If you come near my face
What I'm trying to say

Repeat 1 while:
 We can't be friends
 Can you look me in the eyes 
and honestly say you dont love me?
 Said do you know
 R.L. I know
 I'll never ever find another love like you, oh no
 I love you too much baby
 I love you too much, oh
 We can't be friends, I'm still in love
 with you
 With you
 I am
 Still in love
 Still in love
 You didn't have to leave
 With you
