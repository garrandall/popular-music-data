To just act like we never were
To come around and not show hurt
How dare we greet by shaking hands
Just months ago I was your man

Verbally we agreed
It was over and we were through
I'm trying to compose myself
But I just can't get over you girl

We can't be friends
We can't be friends
We can't be friends
'Cause I'm still in love with you

I went by Mother's, saw your car there
To her you're still family, and it don't seem fair
For everyone to just go on
And I've tried and I can't do it
'Cause I'm still torn
I've tried to think of you
As just another love in my past
That didn't last
But it's not that simple baby

You may see me staring
Or catch me in a daze
May see me hang my head
When you come my way
Don't get too close to me
And expect me to behave
I might just steal a kiss
If you come near my face
What I'm trying to say
