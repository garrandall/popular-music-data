To just act like We never were, to come around
And not show hurt
How dare we greet , by shaking hands
Just months ago I was your man (I was your man)


Verbally we agreed it was over, and we were through
I'm trying to compose myself but I just can't get over you girl


We can't be friends
(oh no, oh no, no, no,)
We can't be friends
(Deborah you know I can't go on being just your friend)
We can't be friends
Cause I'm still in love with you
(yeah)


I went by mothers, saw your car there
To her your still family, and it don't seem fair
For everyone to just go on. I tried and I can't do it
Cause I'm still torn


I tried to think of you as just another love (another love)
In past , that didn't last
But it's not that simple baby


We can't be friends
(oh no,no,no)
We can't be friends
If we, if we can't be lovers
We can't be friends
Cause I'm still in love


(D.C & R.L)
You may see me staring or catch me in a daze
May see me hang my head when you come my way
Don't get to close to me and expect me and expect me to behave
I might just still a kiss if you come near my face
What I'm trying to say


We can't be friends
(Can you look me in the eyes and honestly
Say you don't love me?)
We can't be friends
(Deborah you know, R.L. I know)
We can't be friends
(I'll never, ever find another love like you oh)
I love you too much baby, I love you too much

We can't be friends, I'm still in love with you
