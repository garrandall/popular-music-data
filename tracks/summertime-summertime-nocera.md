Take me
Take me to the water
Summertime, summertime
Maybe, we can fall in love
In summertime, summertime

I listen to the rain outside
Please come and take me for a ride
I really want you
To come and take me far away
I want to say

Take me
Take me to the water
Summertime, summertime
Maybe, we can fall in love
In summertime, summertime

I'm dreaming, lying on the sand
You talk to me and take my hand
I can't believe it's true
But you called me out today
I hear you say

Take me
Take me to the water
Summertime, summertime
Maybe, we can fall in love
In summertime, summertime

Take me
Take me to the water
Summertime, summertime
Maybe, we can fall in love
In summertime, summertime

Summer, summer, summertime
Time, time, summertime
Summer, summer, summertime
Time, time, summertime
Summer, summer, summertime
Take me baby

Take me
Take me to the water
Summertime, summertime
Maybe, we can fall in love
In summertime, summertime

I listen to the rain outside
Please come and take me for a ride
I really want you
To come and take me far away
I want to say

Take me
Take me to the water
Summertime, summertime
Maybe, we can fall in love
