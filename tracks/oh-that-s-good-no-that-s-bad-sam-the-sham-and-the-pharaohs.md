(Oh, that's bad)
No, that's good

Not long ago, I was walkin' down the street
When a woman in a car knocked me off my feet
(Oh, that's bad)
No, that's good

My insurance paid me a lot of dough
More money than I'd seen in a year's payroll
(Oh, that's good)
No, that's bad

On doctor bills is where my money went
And all I had left was a very bad limp
(Oh, that's bad)
No, that's good

'Cause the way I walked, it got me a role
As the Marshall's partner on a TV show
Pretty young actresses started hanging 'round
And every night we'd do the town

(Oh, that's good)
No, that's bad

I ended up back in a hospital bed
'Cause my horse fell on my bad leg
(Oh, that's bad)
No, that's good

'Cause just when I was feeling my worst
I fell in love with a beautiful nurse
(Oh, that's good)
No, that's bad

'Cause I found out she was the doctor's wife
Now I'll be in a wheelchair the rest of my life
'Cause no matter how I pleaded and begged
He operated on my good leg

(Oh, that's bad)
No, that's awful
