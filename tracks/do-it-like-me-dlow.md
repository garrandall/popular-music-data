Ooh ooh, Ah ah, Hey hey, Turn up (boy you better turn up)
Ooh ooh, Ah ah, Hey hey, Turn up (boy you better turn up)

Put ya right leg up, left leg up
Sit down like you sitting on the stairs
Look to the left, look to the right
Look back, give at the bootie and stand

Now twerk, twerk

Now twerk, twerk
Now twerk, twerk, Eh

I can take myself when I step up on the scene (turn up)
And all these haters jockin' cuz they know my swag be mean (squad)
I can do it by myself or I can do it with my team (cuz)
But when I'm with my brothers, we just hit that dream team

Now dream team

Now dream team
Dream team
Dream team
I'm like what these haters mean (turn up)

I double tap with the right, double tap with the left
Swing your arm three times, Eh
Do yo dance, do yo dance
Switch to the other side, Eh
Bunny hop to the right, bunny hop to the left
Pull to the right two times, Eh
Look to the left, feel it in your chest
Now go'n break it down, Eh

Go'n break it down, Eh
Go'n break it down, Eh
Go'n break it down
I say go'n break it down, Eh
Go'n break it down, Eh
Go'n break it down, Eh
Go'n break it down
I say go'n break it down

I've been flexin since a youngin
I keep money in my pocket
I've been all around the world
See them hate, they need to stop it, Eh

Milly rock my best
I just put it in the coffin
But I don't like to swear (turn up)
You can watch me hit the dolphin, Eh

Hoo Hoo, Ha Ha, Hey hey, Turn up (boy you better turn up)
Ooh ooh, Ha Ha, Hey hey, Turn up (boy you better turn up)
Ooh ooh, Ah ah, Hey hey, Turn up (boy you better turn up)
Ooh ooh, Ah ah, Hey hey, Turn up (boy you better turn up)
DLow gang, squad
