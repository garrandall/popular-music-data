Sure as that old whistle's blowin'
There's a tug upon my heart
Somewhere in that misty mornin' light
There's another brand new start
Sometimes I'd love to see this end
And watch it fall apart
'Cause it's still such a long road
And we're a long way from the start
You know anyone can say what's wrong
That don't make it right to me
We weren't born into this life
To walk away from everything
Once you get the blues in your stride
All you need's a song to survive
You think by now we would know that
We're gonna keep this train a-rollin'
We ain't gonna break down on this highway
We could sit here waitin', worried, wonderin'
Wishin' we were somewhere other than right her
But we're right here
