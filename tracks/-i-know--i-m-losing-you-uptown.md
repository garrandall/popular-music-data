Your love is fadin I feel it fade
Ah, your love is fadin I feel it fade
Ah, your love is fadin Woman I feel it fade

Ah, woman, woman your touch, your touch has gone cold
As if someone else controls your very soul

I've fooled myself long as I can
Can feel the presence of another man

It's there when you speak my name
It's just not the same
Ooh babe, I'm losing you

It's in the air
It's there everywhere
Baby, baby, babe, I'm Losing you

When I look into your eyes
A reflection of a face, I see

I'm hurt, down-hearted and worried, girl
Cause that face doesn't belong to me

It's all over your face
Someones takin my place
Ooo baby, I'm losing you

You try hard to hide
The emptiness you feel inside
Oo babe, I'm losing you

I can't bear the thought of losing you
Ah woman, can't you see what I'm goin through

I'm losin my mind
And it's all because of you
I can't bear the thought of losing you

I'm losin my mind
And it's all because of you
I can't stand the thought of losing you.
