Sugar bee, sugar bee
Sugar bee, sugar bee
Sugar bee, sugar bee
Sugar bee, sugar bee

Sugar bee, sugar bee
Look what you done to me

Well, you said you'd be
My honey all night long
When I found you, baby
You were doing wrong

Sugar bee, sugar bee
Sugar bee, sugar bee
Sugar bee, sugar bee
Look what you done to me

Yeah

Well, you came home this morning
Bout a quarter to four
Found another woman
Sitting at my door

Sugar bee, sugar bee
Sugar bee, sugar bee
Sugar bee, sugar bee
Look what you done to me
