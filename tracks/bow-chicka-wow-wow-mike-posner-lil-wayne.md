Once I throw on this, once I throw on this
It's over girl
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this
It's over girl.

I hear you knock knock knock baby come on up
I hope you got got got something in yoâ cup
Cause Iâm three shots deep and I ain't tryna sleep
Get your redbull on cause Iâm ready

Youâve been playing hard to get with me all night
We both know exactly what you want right
Donât tell me what you wonât do
Tell me what you gonâ do, what you gonâ do

Once I throw on this bowchickawowwow
What you gonna say
You act like you gon leave
But I know that you gonâ stay
Break it down dicky downdown
Girl don't even play
Once I set the mood right Iâma make sound like

Iâma make you sound like

Are you tryna make me wait wait wait till the second date
But I cant cant cant even comtemplate
Waiting one more minute lemme jump in it
I bought you flowers and a teddy

Youâve been playing hard to get with me all night
We both know exactly what you want right
Donât tell me what you wonât do
Tell me what you gonâ do what you gonâ do

Once I throw on this bow chicka wow wow
What you gonna say
You act like you gon leave
But I know that you gonâ stay
Break it down dicky downdown
Girl don't even play
Once I set the mood right Ima make you sound like

Yeah I can make you sound like


I gotta leather couch
And a black mic
And we all alone
What it sound like?
The night was dead
We found life
I know I talk shit
But it sound right
You say you canât
But thatâs a fib
Gotta give something
Somethingâs gotta give
I bet you love it
I win the bet
Now we lighting up â¦ cigarettes

Now I ain't even gotta say shit
To make you feel alive girl you know you like that
Owohowohowowoh
Say I ain't even gotta say shit
To make you feel alive girl you know you like that
Owohowohowowoh

Once I throw on this bowchickawowwow
What you gonna say
You act like you gon leave
But I know that you gonâ stay
Break it down dicky downdown
Girl don't even play
Once I set the mood right Iâma make you sound like

Yeah Ima Ima make ya

Once I throw on this, once I throw on this
It's over girl
Once I throw on this,once I throw on this
It's over girl
