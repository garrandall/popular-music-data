Once I throw on this, once I throw on this, it's over, girl
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this, it's over, girl


I hear you knock knock knock, baby, come on up
I hope you got got got something in yo' cup
'Cause I'm three shots deep and I ain't tryna sleep
Get your Redbull on 'cause I'm ready
You've been playin' hard to get with me all night
And we both know exactly what you want, right?
Don't tell me what you wanna do
Tell me what you gon' do
Whatchu gon' do?


Once I throw on this bow chicka wow wow
Whatchu gonna say?
Act like you gon' leave, when I know that you gon' stay
Break it down, dicky down down
Girl, don't even play
Once I set the mood right, I'mma make it sound like
I'mma make it sound like


Are you tryna make me wait wait wait 'til the second day?
But I can't can't can't even contemplate
Waiting one more minute, lemme jump in it
I brought you flowers and a teddy
You've been playin' hard to get with me all night
And we both know exactly what you want, right?
Don't tell me what you wanna do
Tell me what you gon' do
Whatchu gon' do?


Once I throw on this bow chicka wow wow
Whatchu gonna say?
Act like you gon' leave, when I know that you gon' stay
Break it down, dicky down down
Girl, don't even play
Once I set the mood right, I'mma make it sound like
I'mma make it sound like
Yeah, I can make it sound like


I got a leather couch and a black mic
And we all alone, what it sound like?
The night was dead, we found life
I know I talk shit, but it sound right
You say you can't but that's unfair
Gotta give something, something gotta give
I bet you love it, I win the bet
Now we laying up, cigarettes


Now, I ain't even gotta say shit
To make you feel alive, girl, you know you like that
Say, I ain't even gotta say shit
To make you feel alive, girl, you know you like that


Once I throw on this bow chicka wow wow
Whatchu gonna say?
Act like you gon' leave, when I know that you gon' stay
Break it down, dicky down down
Girl, don't even play
Once I set the mood right, I'mma make it sound like
Yeah, I'mma, yeah, I'mma make it


Once I throw on this, once I throw on this, it's over, girl
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this, it's over, girl
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this, it's over, girl
