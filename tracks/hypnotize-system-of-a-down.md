Why don't you ask the kids at Tienanmen square?
Was fashion the reason why they were there?

They disguise it, hypnotize it
Television made you buy it

I'm just sitting in my car and waiting for my

She's scared that I will take her away from there
Dreams that her country left with no one there

Mesmerize the simple minded
Propaganda leaves us blinded

I'm just sitting in my car and waiting for my girl
I'm just sitting in my car and waiting for my girl

I'm just sitting in my car and waiting for my girl
I'm just sitting in my car and waiting for my girl
