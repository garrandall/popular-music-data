Can you stop your instincts?
Can you man your thought control, sir?
Can you give the last command
Or lie to a good soldier?

I'm a doubter, I'm a fool
I am but a man
Cast me out or let me be
All that I am

I am not so sure what you want me for
Either your machine is a fool or me

Now there is no time to wait
No time to think it over
Take the path, believe the math
You'll tell me when it's over

I'm a fighter, I've a question
Won't you answer me?
I have earned the right to know
And tell you what I see

I am not so sure what you want me for
Either your machine is a fool or me
