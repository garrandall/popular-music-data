We are the Bears Shufflin' Crew
Shufflin' on down, doin' it for you
We're so bad, we know we're good
Blowin' your mind like we knew we would
You know we're just struttin' for fun
Struttin' our stuff for everyone
We're not here to start no trouble
We're just here to do the Super Bowl Shuffle


Well, they call me Sweetness
And I like to dance
Runnin' the ball is like makin' romance
We've had the goal since training camp
To give Chicago a Super Bowl champ
And we're not doin' this
Because we're greedy
The Bears are doin' it to feed the needy
We didn't come here to look for trouble
We just came here to do
The Super Bowl Shuffle


This is Speedy Willie, and I'm world class
I like runnin' but I love to get the pass
I practice all day and dance all night
I got to get ready for the Sunday fight
Now I'm as smooth as a chocolate swirl
I dance a little funky, so watch me girl
There's not one here that does it like me
My Super Bowl Shuffle will set you free


I'm Samurai Mike, I stop 'em cold
Part of the defense, big and bold
I've been jammin' for quite a while
Doin' what's right and settin' the style
Give me a chance, I'll rock you good
Nobody messin' in my neighborhood
I didn't come here lookin' for trouble
I just came to do The Super Bowl Shuffle




I'm the punky QB, known as McMahon
When I hit the turf, I've got no plan
I just throw my body all over the field
I can't dance, but I can throw the pill
I motivate the cats, I like to tease
I play so cool, I aim to please
That's why you all got here on the double
To catch me doin' the Super Bowl Shuffle


I'm mama's boy Otis, one of a kind
The ladies all love me
For my body and my mind
I'm slick on the floor as I can be
But ain't no sucker gonna get past me
Some guys are jealous
Of my style and class
That's why some end up on their 
I didn't come here lookin' for trouble
I just get down to The Super Bowl Shuffle


They say Jimbo is our man
If Jimmy can't do it, I sure can
This is Steve, and it's no wonder
I run like lightnin', pass like thunder
So bring on Atlanta, bring on Dallas
This is for Mike and Papa Bear Halas
I'm not here to feather his ruffle
I just came here to do
The Super Bowl Shuffle


I'm L.A. Mike, and I play it cool
They don't sneak by me cause I'm no fool
I fly on the field and get on down
Everybody knows I don't mess around
I can break 'em, shake 'em
Any time of day
I like to steal it and make 'em pay
So please don't try to beat my hustle
Cause I'm just here to do
The Super Bowl Shuffle




The sackman's comin', I'm your man Dent
If the quarterback's slow
He's gonna get bent
We stop the run, we stop the pass
I like to dump guys on their 
We love to play for the world's best fans
You better start makin'
Your Super Bowl plans
But don't get ready or go to any trouble
Unless you practice
The Super Bowl Shuffle


It's Gary here, and I'm Mr.Clean
They call me "hit man"
Don't know what they mean
They throw it long and watch me run
I'm on my man, one-on-one
Buddy's guys cover it down to the bone
That's why they call us the 46 zone
Come on everybody let's scream and yell
We're goin' to do the Shuffle
Then ring your bell


You're lookin' at the Fridge
I'm the rookie
I may be large, but I'm no dumb cookie
You've seen me hit, you've seen me run
When I get the pass, we'll have more fun
I can dance, you will see
The others, they all learn from me
I didn't come here lookin' for trouble
I just came here to do
The Super Bowl Shuffle
