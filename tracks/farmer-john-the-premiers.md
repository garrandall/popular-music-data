Farmer John
I'm in love with your daughter
The one
With the champagne eyes
She knows that I love her
Ever since she showed me those eyes

Farmer John
Someday I will marry
The one
With the champagne eyes
She won't accept my hand
She won't wear my wedding band

I dig the way she walks
The way she talks
She really knocks me out
When she starts moving slow

Let me tell ya Farmer John
I'm in love with your daughter
The one
With the champagne eyes
