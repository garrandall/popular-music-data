Getting ready for the heartbreak

Close up all my windows
So no one could see
Even told the mailman
To pass by me

'Cause my love is coming today
And I know what she's gonna say
So I'm getting ready for the heartbreak
I'm getting ready for the heartbreak

Last night she saw me walking
It was much too dark to see
The girl I was holding hands with
Didn't mean a thing to me

But now my tears are falling like rain
Oh, I'm starting to feel the pain
Just getting ready for the heartbreak
I'm getting ready for the heartbreak

There's no use in carrying on
Soon our love will be gone
So I'm getting ready for the heartbreak
I'm getting ready for the heartbreak

Here it comes now
Any minute now
My baby will walk through the door
And I'll say please
