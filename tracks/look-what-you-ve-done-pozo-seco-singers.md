Hey! Look what youve done
Look what youve done.
Youve taken away
Hmmm, mmmmm
The warm, yellow sun
The warm yellow sun.

And left me alone in a world
A lonely world
Meant for lovin you, girl!

How I miss your lovin feelin
Your sweet kiss, and that lovin feelin
How I miss, holding you, touching you, having you
Like it used to be...
When you loved me.

Oh baby
Oh baby.
Why did you go?
Why did you go?
When you knew
Hmmm, mmmm
I needed you so
I needed you so.
Gave you my heart and my soul
Heart and soul!
You wanted diamonds and gold.

How I miss
