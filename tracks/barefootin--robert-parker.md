Everybody get on your feet
You make me nervous when you in your seat
Take off your shoes and pat your feet
We're doin' a dance that can't be beat
We're barefootin', we're barefootin'
We're barefootin', we're barefootin'

Went to a party the other night
Long Tall Sally was out of sight
Threw way her wig, and her high sneakers too
She was doin a dance without any shoes
She was barefootin', she was barefootin'
She was barefootin', she was barefootin'

Hey little gal with the red dress on
I bet you can barefoot all night long
Take off your shoes and throw them away
Come back and get them another day
We're barefootin', we're barefootin'
We're barefootin', we're barefootin'

Lil John Henry he said to Sue
If I was barefootin' would you barefoot too
Sue told John, "I'm thirty two
I was barefootin ever since I was two
They was barefootin', they was barefootin'
They was barefootin', we barefootin'
We barefootin', we barefootin'
We barefootin', we barefootin'
We barefootin', we barefootin'
We don't have no shoes on
