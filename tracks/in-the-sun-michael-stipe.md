I picture you in the sun wondering what went wrong
And falling down on your knees asking for sympathy
And being caught in between all you wish for and all you seen
And trying to find anything you can feel that you can believe in

May god's love be with you
Always
May god's love be with you

I know I would apologize if I could see in your eyes
'Cause when you showed me myself I became someone else
But I was caught in between all you wish for and all you need
I picture you fast asleep
A nightmare comes
You can't keep awake

May god's love be with you
Always, always
May god's love be with you

'Cause if I find
If I find my own way
How much will I find, if I find
If I find my own way
How much will I find you
You
I found you... You...

I don't know anymore
What it's for
I'm not even sure
If there's anyone who is in the sun
Will you help me to understand

'Cause I been caught in between all you wish for and all you need
Maybe you're not even sure what it's for
Any more than me...

May god's love be with you
Always
May god's love be with you
Always, Always
May god's love be with you

'Cause if I find
If I find my own way
How much will I find, if I find
If I find my own way
How much will I find, if I find
If I find my own way
How much will I find you...
You
I found you... You
Oh, I found you... You
Oh, I found you...
