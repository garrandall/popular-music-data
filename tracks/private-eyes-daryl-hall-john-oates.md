I see you, you see me
Watch you blowin' the lines
When you're making a scene
Oh girl, you've got to know
What my head overlooks
The senses will show to my heart
When it's watching for lies
You can't escape my

Private Eyes
They're watching you
They see your every move
Private Eyes
They're watching you
Private Eyes
They're watching you
Watching you
Watching you
Watching you

You play with words
You play with love
You can twist it around, baby
That ain't enough
'Cos girl
I'm gonna know
If you're letting me in
Or letting me go
Don't lie
When you're hurting inside
'Cos you can't escape my

Private Eyes
They're watching you
They see your every move
Private Eyes
They're watching you
Private Eyes
They're watching you
Watching you
Watching you
Watching you



Why you try to put up a front for me
I'm a spy but on your side, you see
Slip on into any disguise
I'll still know you
Look into my Private Eyes
They're watching you
They see your every move
Oh, babe, Private Eyes
They're watching you
Private Eyes
They're watching you, yeah
They see your every move
They see it
Oh, they're watching you
Private Eyes
They're watching you...
