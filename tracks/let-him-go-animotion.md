You're holding him so tight
That he can't move
If you never give him room
You're gonna lose

He's feeling like he's
Tied up in a knot
Every time he comes home late
He's on the spot

Trust him to be
The kind of man he wants to be
You aren't gonna keep him long
If you give him the third degree

Let him go, let him go
Do the things he's got to do
Give him the freedom that he needs
Even though it worries you

Let him go, let him go
Have the faith that he'll be true
It's the only way you can be sure
He'll come back to you

You want your life with him
To work so well
You forget the love you need
To give yourself

I understand your desire
To keep him near
But you poison love when
You mix it up with fear

Trust yourself to be the woman
That you want to be
If you both have room to grow
Then you'll live in harmony

Let him go, let him go
Do the things he's got to do
Give him the freedom that he needs
Even though it worries you

Let him go, let him go
Have the faith that he'll be true
It's the only way you can be sure
He'll come back to you

Let him go, let him go
Do the things he's got to do
Give him the freedom that he needs
Even though it worries you

Let him go, let him go
Have the faith that he'll be true
It's the only way you can be sure
He'll come back to you

Let him go
Let him go, oh
Let him go, oh
Let him go
