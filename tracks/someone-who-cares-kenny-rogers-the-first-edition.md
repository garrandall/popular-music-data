Someone who cares
Someone who dares to love you
Someone who thinks enough of you
To always be willing to share
Someone who gives
Someone who lives inside you
Someone who'll be strong beside you
Through all the days that you live
I've made up my mind that you're gonna love me
I've made in my heart a soft place for you
Come lie with me Anais
Sleep or the morning's here
Someone who dreams
Of being in your mind tomorrow
Sharing your joys and your sorrow
Helping you see what it means
To be loved
