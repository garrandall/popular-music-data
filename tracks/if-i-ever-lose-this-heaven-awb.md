If you're foolin', only foolin'
All I ask is "why?"
And if you're playin', all I'm sayin' is
Feelings sure can lie
And if you're lyin', keep on lyin'
Don't tell the truth, don't you dare
You can't drop me, baby you still got me
After takin' me way up there (way up there yeah)

Oh
If I ever lose this heaven
If I ever, ever, ever lose this heaven
Oh, I'll never be the same (not the same no)

Oh
If I ever lose this heaven
If I ever, ever, ever lose this heaven (ooh)
Oh, I'll never be the same (never be the same no)

When you're kind, ooh extra kind
Then suddenly oh baby get cross
You're so moody, but you really get to me
And I can't turn you off whoa
You're fascinating, much more fascinating
Than the dark side of the moon
You're so exciting, hey babe I'm re-writing
This book of love called "you" (yes it's you)

Oh
If I ever lose this heaven
If I ever, ever, ever lose this heaven ooh
Oh, I'll never be the same (never never be the same)

Oh
If I ever lose this heaven
If I ever, ever, ever lose this heaven ooh
Whoa, I'll never be the same (no)

Oh
If I ever lose this heaven
If I ever, ever, ever lose this heaven (if I ever lose it baby)
Whoa, I'll never (never never baby)
Never (no I won't no)
Never (never)
Never (be the same)

Oh
If I ever lose this heaven whoa
If I ever, ever, ever lose this heaven
Oh, I'll never be the same (never be the same oh)

Oh
If I ever lose this heaven...
