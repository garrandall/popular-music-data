Sitting with you in a dark room
Warmed by a fireplace
You know there's just something about you
You brighten my day
I got something to run past you
I just hope I say it right
So I take your hand and ask you
Have you made plans for the rest of your life?


There's one thing I should be killing off and giving up now
And that's worryin' about life
Oh, I'll be fine
If one gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline grows, I'll be fine
Even if time takes its toll
We'll stay young for the rest of our lives


I've been making plans for children
Since I've been looking in your eyes
I even have names picked out for them
Daughter'd be Rose
Son; it'd be Ryan


There's one thing I should be killing off and giving up now
And that's worrying about life
Oh, I'll be fine
If one gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline grows, I'll be fine
Even if time takes its toll
We'll stay young for the rest of our lives

I don't really care about those storm clouds brewing
Oh, as long as you're here by my side
Oh, we'll be young, oh we'll be young
Oh, we'll be young, when we're old

Oh, I'll be fine
If my gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline grows, I'll be fine
Even when time takes its toll
I'll stay young for the rest of my life
With you, I'll stay young for the rest of my life
With you
We'll stay young for the rest of our life
