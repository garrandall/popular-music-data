People, I've been misled
And I've been afraid
I've been hit in the head
And left for dead
I've been abused
And I've been accused
I've been refused a piece of bread

But I ain't never
In my life before
Seen so many love affairs
Go wrong as I do today

I want you to STOP
And find out what's wrong
Get it right
Or just leave love alone

Because the love you save today
May very well-l-l-l be your own

Listen to me

I've been pushed around
I've been lost and found
I've been given til sundown
To get out of town
I've been taken outside
And I've been brutalized
And I've had to always be the one to smile and apologize

But I ain't never
In my life before
Seen so many love affairs
Go wrong as I do today

I want you to STOP
And find out what's wrong
Get it right
Or just leave love alone

Because the love you save today
May very well-l-l-l be your own
