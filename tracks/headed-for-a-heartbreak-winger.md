Yeah

Morning came and I was on my way
When you reminded me
I had too soon forgotten
It was you that set me free
Yeah, you were here when I came
You'll be here when I'm gone
So don't be waiting on love
'Cause I'll be waiting to ramble on

Headed for a heartbreak
Headed for a heartbreak

Darling, don't wait up for me
Tonight I won't be home
You've become a stranger
I just got to be alone
Don't need nobody on my side
To dull the blade I'm on
So don't be waiting on love
'Cause I'll be waiting to ramble on

Headed for a heartbreak
Headed for a heartbreak
Headed for a heartbreak

It's not a mistake
Don't you think I can feel the pain?
I walk away, to live again...

Headed for a heartbreak
Headed for a heartbreak (Don't make me hurt you)
Headed for a heartbreak ('Cause I love you...)
Headed for a heartbreak

Don't you think I feel the pain?
