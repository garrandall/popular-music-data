I think, I think I see where you're goin' with this one E

Hey, hey, been around the world and back, yeah I did that
Still kick raps in cars and packs, so where's my kids at?
These motherfuckers hatin' sounded funnier than Sinbad
I'm ill as the pills that they give you when you collapse

This, that, the other, kiss your mother with that mouth?
We the assholes that she warned you about
We just storm in your house open doors through a cloud
Got an assortment of styles, just be sure that it's wild

6:30 in the mornin' and there still ain't signs of slowin' down
Twin sisters gettin' wasted so they both are down
It's goin' down, I thought I told you man
If you tryna party let me see you raise your hand

There's a party on 5th Ave (a party on 5th Ave)
Hit me if you tryna go (hit me if you tryna go)
I can be there in like 20
I'mma honk and they come runnin', 'cause we gotta hit the road

Make you sure you got a clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes
Bring it with you, buy it there, you choose
There's a party on 5th Ave tonight
And that's what I'm trying to do

Hey, what's the difference between me and you?
When no one believe in you, I'm flyer than beetle juice
Don't count on the sheep to snooze
I'm fucked up off weed and booze
I party then sleep 'til noon, what every day people do

So wait and see me improve
Just give me a week or two
See when you read the news my bitches don't sleep at noon
My rhyme time is why, my album is fly
Your favorite record, you gonna put it aside

This that old-school shit soundin' good in the ride
And fuck ten I'm only countin' to nine
Said this that old-school shit, soundin' good in the ride
Said let's head out to the party I'll drive

There's a party on 5th Ave (a party on 5th Ave)
Hit me if you tryna go (hit me if you tryna go)
I can be there in like 20
I'mma honk and they come runnin', 'cause we gotta hit the road

Make you sure you got a clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes
Bring it with you, buy it there, you choose
There's a party on 5th Ave tonight
And that's what I'm trying to do

What's goin' on? There's a party
Hope the neighbors don't mind us gettin' loud
Homies to the left, all the ladies to the right
We came to get down, we gon' do that now

My light-up shoes on, my light-up shoes on
My light-up shoes on
They love the way my kicks flash
This ain't a time to just sit back
'Cause, there's a party on 5th Ave

There's a party on 5th Ave (a party on 5th Ave)
Hit me if you tryna go (hit me if you tryna go)
I can be there in like 20
I'mma honk and they come runnin', 'cause we gotta hit the road

Make you sure you got a clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes
Bring it with you, buy it there, you choose
There's a party on 5th Ave tonight
And that's what I'm trying to do
