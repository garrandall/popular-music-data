Thou shalt never love another
And stand by me all the while
Take happiness with the heartache
And go through love wearing a smile
Oh, how happy we will be if we keep the ten commandments of love
Oh love

Thou shalt always have faith in me
In everything I say and do
Love with all your heart and soul
Until our life on earth is through
Oh how happy we will be if we keep the ten commandments of love

Love, oh sweet love
It's oh, oh so grand
You will find since the beginning of time
It has proved throughout all the land

So come to me when I am lonely
Kiss me when you hold me tight
Treat me sweet and gentle
When we say good night
Oh, how happy we will be if we keep the ten commandments of love
Oh, love
Oh, how happy we will be if we keep the ten commandments of love
(spoken) The Ten Commandments of Love
