The rain is falling lightly on the buildings and the cars
I've said goodbye to city friends, department stores and bars
The lights of town are at my back, my heart is full of stars
And I'm gonna be a country girl again

Oh yes, I'm gonna be a country girl again
With an old brown dog and a big front porch and rabbits in the pen
I tell you, all the lights on Broadway don't amount to an acre green
And I'm gonna be a country girl again

I spent some time in study, oh, I've taken my degrees
And memorized my formula, my A's and B's and C's
But what I know came long ago and not from such as these
And I'm gonna be a country girl again

Oh yes, I'm gonna be a country girl again
With an old brown dog and a big front porch and rabbits in the pen
I tell you, all the lights on Broadway don't amount to an acre green
And I'm gonna be a country girl again

I've wandered in the hearts of men looking for the sign
But here I might learn happiness, I might learn peace of mind
The one who taught my lesson was the soft wind through the pines
I'm gonna be a country girl again

Oh yes, I'm gonna be a country girl again
With an old brown dog and a big front porch and rabbits in the pen
I tell you, all the lights on Broadway don't amount to an acre green
And I'm gonna be a country girl again

Oh yes, I'm gonna be a country girl again
With an old brown dog and a big front porch and rabbits in the pen
I tell you, all the lights on Broadway don't amount to an acre green
And I'm gonna be a country girl again
