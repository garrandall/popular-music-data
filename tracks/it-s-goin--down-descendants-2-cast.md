Welcome
Finally


Huh, let's get this party started
I swear I'm cold-hearted
There's no negotiation
I'm not here for debatin'
You need some motivation?
Just look at Ben's face
Then ask yourself how long you think I'll remain patient
I'll throw him overboard and let him swim with killer sharks
You either hand over the wand or he'll be ripped apart
Now, let's all just be smart
Although for you that must be hard
You'll get your wand
No one has to come to any harm
Don't try to intimidateYour bark is much worse than your bite
Who's the baddest of them all?
I guess we're finding out tonight


Let's go, bring it on
Better give us what we want
It's the wand for the crown
If you don't, it's going down
Let's go, make your move
Peace or war, it's up to you
Give him up and do it now
If you don't, it's going down
We want the wand
Or else the king is gone
Your time is running out
You should really watch your mouth
Let's go, pound for pound
We're prepared to stand our ground
Put your swords up, put 'em up
It's going down


Yo-ho, ho-oh, oh-oh, make the trade
Yo-ho, ho-oh, oh-oh, or walk the plank
Yo-ho, ho-oh, oh-oh, make the trade
Yo-ho, ho-oh, oh-oh, or walk the plank


Ok, look, this is not a conversation
It's a do-or-die situation
If you don't give me back the king
I'll have no hesitation
I'll serve you right here
And I don't need a reservation
That way your whole pirate crew can have a demonstration
Release him now, and we can go our separate ways
Unless you wanna deal with me and the VK's
So that's your big speech, huh?
An empty ultimatum?
All it takes is one swing and I'll humiliate him
Matter of fact, make one wrong move and I'll debilitate him
And if he even starts to slip, I'll eliminate him
All it takes is one wrong look and I'll---
Harry! We get it. Chill


Let's go, bring it on
Better give us what we want
It's the wand for the crown
If you don't, it's going down
Let's go, make your move
Peace or war, it's up to you
Give him up and do it now
If you don't, it's going down
We want the wand
Or else the king is gone
Your time is running out
You should really watch your mouth
Let's go, pound for pound
We're prepared to stand our ground
Put your swords up, put 'em up
It's going down


Hey, we don't have to choose
We don't have to light the fuse
Mal, whatever you do, it's gonna be a lose-lose
There's gotta be a better way
Uma, I promise I'll give you your chance
You'll have your say
Silly king! You? Give me?
You're gonna give me a chance?
Well, not a chance


Yo-ho, ho-oh, oh-oh, make the trade
Yo-ho, ho-oh, oh-oh, or walk the plank
Yo-ho, ho-oh, oh-oh, make the trade
Yo-ho, ho-oh, oh-oh, or walk the plank


Let's go, bring it on
Bring it on, it's going down
Time is running out
Bring it on, it's going down
Let's go, bring it on
Bring it on, it's going down
Time is running out
Bring it on, it's going down
Let's go, pound for pound
We're prepared to stand our ground
Put your swords up, put 'em up
It's going down


Yo-ho, ho-oh, woah-oh, oh-oh
Yo-ho, ho-oh, woah-oh, oh-oh
Yo-ho, ho-oh, woah-oh, oh-oh
Yo-ho, ho-oh, woah-oh, oh-oh


Uma, Uma, Uma, Uma
What's my name?
What's my name?
What's my name?
Say it now!
