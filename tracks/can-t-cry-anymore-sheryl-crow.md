Took your car
Drove to Texas
Sorry, honey
But I suspected we were through
And I can't cry anymore
Since I left
Been feeling better, cause
That's what you get when you
Stay together too long
And I can't cry anymore


Wouldn't it be good if
We could hop a flight to anywhere?
So long to this life
So much for pretending
Bad luck's never-ending
And now I know that


Money comes in
But the fact is
There's not enough to
Pay my taxes
And I can't cry anymore
Well, got a brother
He's got real problems
Heroin - no
There's just no stopping him tonight
And I won't cry anymore


Wouldn't it be good if
We could hop a flight to anywhere?
So long to this life
So much for pretending
Bad luck's never-ending
And now I know that


It's never ending


It could be worse
I could've missed my calling
Sometimes it hurts
But when you read the writing on the wall
Can't cry anymore


Wouldn't it be good if
We could hop a flight to anywhere?
So long to this life
So much for pretending
Bad luck's never-ending
And now I know that


And too much time I've been spending
With my heart in my hands
Waiting for time to come and mend it
I can't cry anymore
