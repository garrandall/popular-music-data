Who you are, where you're from
What you do
As long as you love me 
Here we go!

I got a feelin'
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
I know that we'll have a ball
If we get down and go out and just lose it all
I feel stressed out and I wanna let it go
Let's go way out spaced out and losing all control

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
But in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword, my shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

(Oh...hey)
It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to say
Sunshine she's here you can take a break
Hot air balloon that we can go to space
With the air like I don't care baby by the way
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the you
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you (Happy)
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do

We clawed, we chained
Our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
In love no one could deny
Don't you ever say
"I just walked away, I will always want you"
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was, wre-e-eck me
Yeah you, you wre-e-eck

I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror
