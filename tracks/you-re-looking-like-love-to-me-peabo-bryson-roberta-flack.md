It may be way
Too early in the game
For you or me to know
How far we'll go

But when I look at you
From any point of view, I see
Whoa, you're looking like love to me

We've only met
And yet it feels so right
To see the fire
Between us come aglow

You make my body melt
I swear I never felt so free
Whoa, you're looking like love to me

Do I expect too much
And move too fast
Do I expect so much
So soon to last forever

I'm gonna toss
All caution to the wind
And let my deep down
Feelings overflow

I bet my life on us
Tonight, I tell you, trust in me
Whoa, you're looking like love

Oh, you make my body melt
I swear I never felt so free
Whoa, you're looking like love to me

Whoa, looking like love
Definitely you're looking
Like love to me

So lovely, love
Whoa, you're looking like love to me
