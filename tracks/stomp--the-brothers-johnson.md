Steppin' out the weekends open wide
Fill it up, let's blast the jams and ride

While we're cruisin' around in the street
Listen up for the party in feet
Slap me five that's the place we've arrived, it's alive

Ev'rybody take it to the top we're
Gonna stomp all night
In the neighbourhood
Don't it feel all right

Gonna stomp all night
Wanna party
Till the morning light

Runnin', runnin', runnin'

The set is hot, there's people wall to wall
Old ones, young things, short ones standing tall

So grab the one with the smile on her face
And hit the floor and stay right on the case
The heat is on and the funk just won't leave us alone

Ev'rybody take it to the top we're
Gonna stomp all night
In the neighbourhood
Don't it feel all right

Gonna stomp all night
Wanna party
Till the morning light

Gonna stomp all night
In the neighbourhood
Don't it feel all right

Gonna stomp all night
Wanna party
Till the morning light

Stomp!

Stomp, step down in it
Put your foot where you feel the fit
Stomp, you don't wanna quit
Put your heels where you're feeling it

Stomp, step down in it
Put your foot where you feel the fit
Stomp, you don't wanna quit
Put your heels where you're feeling it

Stomp, step down in it
Put your foot where you feel the fit
Stomp, you don't wanna quit
Put your heels where you're feeling it

Stomp all night
In the neighbourhood
Don't it feel all right

Gonna stomp all night
Wanna party
Till the morning light

Stomp all night
In the neighbourhood
Don't it feel all right

Gonna stomp all night
Wanna party
Till the morning light (Well, well, well)

Stomp all night
In the neighbourhood
Don't it feel all right

Gonna stomp all night
Wanna party
Till the morning light

Stomp all night
In the neighbourhood
Don't it feel all right

Gonna stomp all night
Wanna party
Till the morning light

Stomp all night
In the neighbourhood
Don't it feel all right

Gonna stomp all night (All night)
Wanna party
Till the morning light

Stomp!

Stomp, step down in it
Put your foot where you feel the fit (Take it to the top)
Stomp, you don't wanna quit
Put your heels where you're feeling it (Take it to the top)

Stomp, step down in it
Put your foot where you feel the fit (Take it to the top)
Stomp, you don't wanna quit
Put your heels where you're feeling it (Take it to the top)

Stomp, step down in it
Put your foot where you feel the fit (Take it to the top)
Stomp, you don't wanna quit
Put your heels where you're feeling it (Take it to the top)

Stomp, step down in it
Put your foot where you feel the fit
Stomp, you don't wanna quit
Put your heels where you're feeling it

Stomp, step down in it
Put your foot where you feel the fit
Stomp, you don't wanna quit
Put your heels where you're feeling it

Stomp, step down in it
Put your foot where you feel the fit
Stomp, you don't wanna quit
Put your heels where you're feeling it

Stomp, step down in it
Put your foot where you feel the fit
Stomp, you don't wanna quit
Put your heels where you're feeling it

Stomp, step down in it
Put your foot where you feel the fit
Stomp, you don't wanna quit
