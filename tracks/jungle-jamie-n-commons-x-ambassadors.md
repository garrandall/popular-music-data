Yeah
Yeah?
Yeah

Well it's too long living in the same old lives (Yeah)
I feel too cold to live, too young to die (Yeah)
Will you walk the line, like it's there to choose? (Oh)
(Oh lord) Just forget the wit, it's the best to use

Oh Lord
I said oh Lord

Won't you follow me into the jungle (Yeah)
Ain't no god on my streets in the heart of the jungle (Oh Lord child)
Won't you follow me into the jungle (Yeah)
Ain't no god on my streets in the heart of the jungle (Oh Lord child)
Won't you follow me into the jungle

I lost my mind, in the city of lights (Yeah)
In the backstreets bills in the neon lights (Yeah)
When I heard the thunder, I could feel the rain (Yeah)
It's the same religion (Oh Lord), just a different name (Oh Lord)

I said oh Lord

Won't you follow me into the jungle (Yeah)
Ain't no god on my streets in the heart of the jungle (Oh Lord child)
Won't you follow me into the jungle (Yeah)
Ain't no god on my streets in the heart of the jungle (Oh Lord child)
Won't you follow me into the jungle

Oh
Oh
Oh Lord
I said oh Lord
I said oh Lord

Wont you follow me into the jungle (Yeah)
Ain't no god on my streets in the heart of the jungle (Oh Lord child)
Won't you follow me into the jungle (Yeah)
Ain't no god on my streets in the heart of the jungle (Oh Lord child)
Won't you follow me into the jungle
