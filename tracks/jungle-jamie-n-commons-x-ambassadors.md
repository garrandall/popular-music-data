Yeah, I wear my chain to the game
But for the game I sip champagne from the world cup
Oh yeah, Iâm here to stir shit up
I pray on a hill in Brazil
To Christ the Redeemer
But most kids worship us
(Ah!)
Iâm just warming up
Iâm almost ready
Turn it up a bit more in the headphones
Check me out though, look


Itâs cops to dodge in the city of God
To reach the goals of these soccer stars
Thereâs records to break, medals to take
Flags to wave, the city is ours
Thereâs ceilings to climb, the road winds
Only lights is those from a Beamer
Itâs nice to pray in front of Christ the Redeemer
If your God is bigger than my God up there
My God bigger than your God down here
Whom shall I fear?
Itâs foretold by Calogero, most Bronx tales donât end well
Especially when your own country treats you like an infidel
There's odds against it ends well
Donât box me into the corner, I
Float like a butterfly, sting like Muhammad A
On training day I go too hard, ask Antoine Fuqua
I am Godzilla of these favelas, new God flow


Wonât you follow me into the jungle? (yeah)
Ainât no God on these streets in the heart of the jungle (oh, Lord child)
Wonât you follow me into the jungle? (yeah)
Ain't no god on my streets in the heart of the jungle (oh lord child)
Won't you follow me into the jungle


I lost my mind, in the city of lights (yeah)
In the backstreets buildings and the neon lights (yeah)
When I heard the thunder, I could feel the rain (yeah)
It's the same to me, just a different name
