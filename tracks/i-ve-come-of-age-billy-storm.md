I've come of age
To understand the spring
To know the reason why
A robin starts to sing

I've come of age
To see how dreams are born
And know a heart can breathe
Although it may be torn

Too long a time
Things has passed me by
But I now have grown
To meet them eye to eye

I've come of age
And all the world is new
Because I've found with you
Love to last the ages through

Oh, I've come of age
And all the world is new
Because I've found with you
Love to last the ages through
