Who is he
What is he to you

Who is he
What is he to you

Who is he
What is he to you

Who is he
What is he to you

A man we passed just
Tried to stare me down
And when I looked at you, girl
You looked at the ground
Yes, you did

Now I don't know who he is
But I think that you do
Dad gum it, who is he
And what is he to you

Something in my heart
And in your eyes, oh, girl
Tells me he's not someone
Just passing by, oh, no

And when you cleared your throat
Was that your cue, oh, girl
Dad gum it, who is he
And what is he to you, oh, girl

When I add the
Sum of you and me
I get confused cause
I keep coming up with three
You know that ain't right, baby

You're too much for one man
But not enough for two
Dad gum it, who is he
And what is he to you

You tell me men
Don't have much intuition
That's what you said
Is that what think
Or are you only wishing

Before you wreck your old home
And search another new
Dad gum it, who is he
And what is he to you

Dad gum it, who is he
And what is he to you
Dad gum it, who is he
And what is he to you

Dad gum it, who is he
And what is he to you
