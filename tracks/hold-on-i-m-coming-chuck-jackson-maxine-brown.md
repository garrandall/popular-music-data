Now don't you ever be sad
Lean on me when your times are bad

When the day comes and you're down
In a river of trouble, I'll be around

Hold on, I'm coming
Hold on, I'm coming

I'm on my way to you, lover
If you get cold, I'll be your cover

No, no need to worry cause I'm here
No need to suffer, baby, cause I'm here

Hold on, I'm coming
Hold on, I'm coming
Hold on, don't you worry
Hold on, I'm coming
Look here

Reach out to me for satisfaction
(Yeah) I like that but listen
To what I have to tell you
You call my name my name, yeah
For quick reaction, yeah, yeah, yeah

Now don't you ever be sad
Lean on me when times get bad
When the day come and you're down
In a river of troubles and about to drown

Hold on, I'm coming
Hold on, I'm coming
(One more time)
Hold on (don't you worry)
I'm coming (please hurry)
Hold on (come on)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You better hurry (don't you worry)
Please hurry (hold on, baby)
Come on, baby (here I come)
Oh, I need you (yeah)

For satisfaction
(Here I come)...
