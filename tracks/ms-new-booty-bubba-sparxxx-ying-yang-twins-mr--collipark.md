Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere
Rockin' everywhere

I found you Ms. New Booty
Get it together then bring it back to me
Hit the playas club for about month or 2
Put a tan on it then see what it do

Get it ripe, get it right, get it tight

Girl I don't need you, but chu need me
Take it off, let if flop, shake it freely
And I don't tell stories, I let em tell theyself
And you aint gotta sell sex, girl, it sell itself, Like nothing else
Yeah I'm a country boy, but that big city bottom fill me up with joy
Aint life grand (life's grand) livin up baby
Here go da whisper song, baby this is us ready?
Put it on me enthusiastically, what ever it is that chu do, you do it admirably
And I aint choose it, that thang chose me
Its bubba and ying yang, all the way in this thang
Go!

Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere
Rockin' everywhere

I found you Ms. New Booty
Get it together then bring it back to me
Hit the playas club for about month or 2
Put a tan on it then see what it do

Get it ripe, get it right, get it tight

Quarter to twelve and we just getting in
Bubba gonna make ya spark wit da Ying Yang Twins
Sippin on patron, blong blong blong
Shawdy in a thong, whom whom whom
Ass get da jiggling, MOTHER FUCKING WIGGLYING
Get that thang shakin, like she frost bit shivering
Ass be delivering, all type of flashes, cashes
Got these hoes shaking that molasses

Let me whisper in your ear
Get your self together go and buy some new gear
Do something with your hair den
Hit da club, shake ya ass and da playas gonna sho some love
Do that move ya did just a minute ago
I guarantee you I make all da dough
So go on do ya thing baby, work what chu got, to get what chu want
Make that money, don't let it make u

Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere
Rockin' everywhere

I found you Ms. New Booty
Get it together then bring it back to me
Hit the playas club for about month or 2
Put a tan on it then see what it do

Get it ripe, get it right, get it tight

Hi there, how are things?
I once was breast man now it seems
Ever since I had the pleasure
Of getting you together, your chest is just whatever
I found the buried treasured
Yes ma'am, heres the plan
Meet me over yonder ok- don't play
Ill bring the whip whoop, you bring your cook book
And ima fix that stuff up, everything is good good

Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere
Rockin' everywhere

I found you Ms. New Booty
Get it together then bring it back to me
Hit the playas club for about month or 2
Put a tan on it then see what it do

Get it ripe, get it right, get it tight
