She floats like a swan, grace on the water
Lips like sugar, lips like sugar
Just when you think you've caught her, she glides across the water
She calls for you tonight to share the moonlight
You'll flow in her river
She'll ask you and you'll give her
Lips like sugar, sugar kisses
Lips like sugar, sugar kisses
She knows what she knows, I know what she's thinking
Sugar kisses, soar kisses
Just when you think she's yours, she's flown to other shores
To laugh at how you break and melt into her lake
You'll flow in her river
She'll ask you and you'll give her
Lips like sugar, sugar kisses
Lips like sugar, sugar kisses
She'll be my mirror, reflect what I am
A loser and a winner the king of Siam I am and my Siamese twin
Alone on the river
Amazing river, amazing river
Lips like sugar, sugar kisses
Lips like sugar, sugar kisses
Lips like sugar, sugar kisses
Lips like sug-sug-sugar, sugar kisses
