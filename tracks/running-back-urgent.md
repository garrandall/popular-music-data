I'm not gonna fall in love anymore
I don't wanna hear that word anymore, anymore
Easier said than done
Easier said than done

I keep saying to myself "it's only love"
Who needs all that stupid stuff anyway, anyway
Easier said than done
Easier said than done

I keep running back
Running back
Running back
Running back for more, for more

I keep running back
Running back
Running back
Running back for more, for more

Easier said than done (easier said than done)
Easier said than done

I keep running back
Running back
Running back
Running back for more, for more

I keep running back
Running back
Running back
Running back for more, for more

Running back (I'm not gonna fall in love anymore)
Running back
Running back
Running back for more, for more

Running back (I don't want to hear that word anymore)
Running back
Running back
Running back for more, for more

Running back (I'm not gonna fall in love anymore)
Running back
Running back
Running back for more, for more
