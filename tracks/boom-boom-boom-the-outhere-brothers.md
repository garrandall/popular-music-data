Look out below
Here comes the Brother with the offbeat flow

I just fell from the mothership

Don't trip, check out how I do it
Malik is in the house I turn your body into fluid
As I come from the depths of Doom
I snap back at you ow! with the boom

Let me hear you say wayoh
Let me hear you say wayoh
Let, let, let me hear yuo say wayoh
Let me hear you say

Ow, I came to make you shake it
Till you break it
Caress your body until you're naked
Bend you over
Grab your shoulder
Slip my peter inside your folder
Make you sweat-a
Get you wet-a
Pump it faster to make it better
Dim the the lights then lock the room
Cos now it's time for me to hit that boom

I say boom boom boom let me hear u say wayo
I say boom boom boom now everybody say wayo
I say boom boom boom let me hear u say wayo
I say boom boom boom now everybody say wayo
