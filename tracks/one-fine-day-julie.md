She's by herself again
In the quiet secret night
Below the neighbour's window
Hands in pockets; head on one side

And the radio plays an unknown song
That has nothing at all to do with God
But it's miles away from this sad town
And the stupid kids who get her down
Just wait until Big Julie rules the world
Big Julie rules the world

Well, the radio still plays:
Floating beyond time
Like the greatest people in the world
All springing up and feeling fine

And it's far away from these sweaty lads
Who say that boys cannot be slags
And if it's not them then it's their dads
Like the guy who felt her up in class
And Sunday school teacher who said she had beautiful breasts
And the local radio DJ who is so obviously obsessed
Yeah, form an orderly queue when Big Julie rules the world
Big Julie rules the world

Yeah, go and chase your dreams
But if your dreams are not your own
Then wouldn't it be better
Just to work things out at home?

And she knows sex is just for dummies anyway
Something you do when you've run out of things to say
But this song will play until the light
It's the sound of her trying to find something to like
The sound of her walking day and night
And this song may lead her far away
But tonight it seems to light the way
And she can almost see the future shine
And everything's in tune and everything's in time
It will play until the day Big Julie rules the world
Big Julie rules the world
