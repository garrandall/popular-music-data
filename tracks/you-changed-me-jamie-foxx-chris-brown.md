Don't talk to me, I'm geek
Don't talk to me, I'm serious baby
Ohh, you don't even know
Oh baby get it over
Now it's starting to show
Oh baby

Ain't no sense in frontin' when you know I got a thing for you
Ain't no other girls in mind it's me and you baby, I love you
Used to be the kind of nigga never wanna settle down
Cause you changed me baby 

Say I never settled down
I'm with you girl, look at me now
Cause you changed me baby
I be a player for life
You switched that all up in one night, oh baby
Ain't no sense in frontin' when you know I got a thing for you
Ain't no other girls in mind it's me and you baby, I love you
Used to be the kind of nigga never wanna settle down

Put it on me baby
Not just the physical
You mentally stimulate me
I'm really in love that's crazy
Girl you can't even save me
You got me thinkin' 'bout us havin' us some babies
Everything about love got me like
Baby come home and put it on me tonight
I want it right now girl I can't even lie
Fuck them other girls, they ain't you
You're the only one I need and that's the truth, oh baby

Ain't no sense in frontin' when you know I got a thing for you
Ain't no other girls in mind it's me and you baby, I love you
Used to be the kind of nigga never wanna settle down
Cause you changed me baby
I've been searchin for the answers babe
Cause you changed me baby
I never met a girl that made my life as good as you
Cause you changed me baby
You da one that sew me in, wanna have my kids, wanna see me win
Girl it ain't just me
Tell 'em how you feel Breezy


You know what I'm missin', fiendin' for your kisses
All night on my phone, when you talk I listen
Sexin' all in the kitchen
Breakin' all of these dishes
Your crib or my bed, it don't make a difference
I'm lickin' on your body girl I'm feelin' on your booty
Now you really wanna do the nasty
Girl I love it when you get on your knees you make me disappear like magic
Girl you don't even know
All the bitches I let go, for you


Ain't no sense in frontin' when you know I got a thing for you
Ain't no other girls in mind it's me and you baby, I love you
Used to be the kind of nigga never wanna settle down
Cause you changed me baby
All the things I used to be I ain't no more
Cause you changed me baby
Shorty you the change that I've been hoping for
Cause you changed me baby

Say I never settled down
I'm with you girl, look at me now
Cause you changed me baby
I be a player for life
You switched that all up in one night, oh baby
Ain't no sense in frontin' when you know I got a thing for you
Ain't no other girls in mind it's me and you baby, I love you
Used to be the kind of nigga never wanna settle down
Until the day that you came around
Cause you changed me baby

You know I've been all over the world, man
I had really gave up on this shit, you know
Finally met a girl that do for me though
It's crazy, it's like a dream
I think I got me one
