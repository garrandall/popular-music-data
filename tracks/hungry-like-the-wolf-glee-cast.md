Dark in the city, night is a wire
Steam in the subway, Earth is a fire
Do-do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do, do do

Woman, you want me, give me a sign
And catch my breathing even closer behind
Do-do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do, do do

Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand (smell like I sound)
Just like that river twisting through a dusty land (straddle the line)
And when she shines she really shows you all she can (mouth is alive)
Oh Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grande

Stalked in the forest, too close to hide
I'll be upon you by the moonlight side
Do-do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do, do do

High blood drumming on your skin, it's so tight
You feel my heat, I'm just a moment behind
Do-do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do, do do

Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand (smell like I sound)
Just like that river twisting through a dusty land (straddle the line)
And when she shines she really shows you all she can (mouth is alive)
Oh Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grande

Hungry like the wolf
Hungry like the wolf
Hungry like the wolf
Don't make a sound

Her name is Rio, she don't need to understand (smell like I sound)
And I might find her if I'm looking like I can (straddle the line)
Oh Rio, Rio hear them shout across the land (mouth is alive)
From mountains in the north down to the Rio Grande (burning the ground)

Her name is Rio, she don't need to understand (smell like I sound)
From mountains in the north down to the Rio Grande (burning the ground)
