Walk away if you want to
it's ok, if you need to
you can run, but you can never hide
From the shadow that's creeping up beside you
There's a magic running through your soul
But you can't have it all

(Whatever you do)
I'll be two steps behind you
(Wherever you go)
and I'll be there to remind you
that it only takes a minute of your precious time
to turn around and I'll be two steps behind.

Take the time
to think about it
Walk the line, you know you just can't fight it
Take a look around and see what you can find
Like the fire that's burning up inside me,
There's a magic running through your soul
But you can't have it all

(Whatever you do)
I'll be two steps behind you
(Wherever you go)
and I'll be there to remind you
that it only takes a minute of your precious time
to turn around and I'll be two steps behind.

There's a magic running through your soul
but you, you can't have it all
(Whatever you do)
I'll be two steps behind you
(wherever you go)
and I'll be there to remind you
that it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around and I'll be two steps behind.

Two steps behind
yeah, baby
two steps behind
oh, sugar
two steps behind
