How did you get here?
I'm drunk and confused
I tried to be patient with you
Yeah
High up, you're falling back down


Trapped in a concept
Falsely accused
Misused, and misled
Bitch, I'm hoping you fucking rest in peace
Now the fact that I'm alone is fucking comforting
And I can't seem to shake this fucking feeling in my...
Uh, cold shoulder, heart broken, misspoken
I'm cut open, the fingers in all my stab wounds
And if she could, she'd prolly dance
On my grave, inside my head
I see your face, I fucking hate
That I love you still
Yeah

Carry on, life flies, so just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Carry on, life flies, so just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Carry on, life flies, so just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Yeah


How did you get here?
I'm drunk and confused
I tried to be patient with you, yeah
High up, you fucked up bad
