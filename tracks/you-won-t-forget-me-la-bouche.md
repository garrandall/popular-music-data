Ooooooooo

Tonight is the night
You're gonna get the best
I'll treat you right, I'm better than the rest
Wherever you go, and wherever you will be
You won't forget me, you won't forget me

Oo-oo-oo, na-na-na-na
Your gonna miss what I got to offer
Oo-oo-oo, na-na-na-na

When you need action, love and affection
You're gonna run to me
And when you are feezin' you'll search for me to be your cover
And when you feel lonely, I'll be the only one to set you free
If you're man enough I'll be you perfect lover endlessly

Tonight is the night
You're gonna get the best
I'll treat you right, I'm better than the rest
Wherever you go, and wherever you will be
You won't forget me, you won't forget me

Bridge:
Oo-oo-oo, na-na-na-na
Without my love you will surely suffer
Oo-oo-oo, na-na-na-na
You're gonna miss what I got to offer

You won't forget me
You won't forget me
You won't forget me, no!

Tonight's the night, you won't forget this love
Relax your mind and let your body unwind
There's no more pressure, no more pain
Tonight girl, don't be ashamed
No matter what the cravin' because I'm staying
Provide, no criticise
No matter what the need, I'll give you what you need
Don't doubt, our love is turn you out

You'll be on fire, you can't deny a
Love that's heaven-sent
When I touch your heart, I'm gonna start
A dream that never ends

Oo-oo-oo, na-na-na-na
Without my love you will surely suffer
Oo-oo-oo, na-na-na-na
You're gonna miss what I got to offer

I want you, I want you
Like a drug in my vein
Like a drug in my vein
You won't forget meeee!

Tonight is the night
You're gonna get the best
I'll treat you right, I'm better than the rest
Wherever you go, and wherever you will be
You won't forget me, you won't forget me

Tonight is the night
You're gonna get the best
I'll treat you right, I'm better than the rest
Wherever you go, and wherever you will be
You won't forget me, you won't forget me

Oo-oo-oo, na-na-na-na
Without my love you will surely suffer
Oo-oo-oo, na-na-na-na
You're gonna miss what I got to offer

You won't forget me baby, you won't forget me
You won't forget me!
