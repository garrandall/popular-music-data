Going to a go-go
Going to a go-go
Well, there's a brand new place I found
Where people come from miles around
They come from every world and if you drop in there
You might see anyone in town
Going to a go-go Everybody
Going to a go-go Come on now
Don't you wanna go, yeah
Oh, sugar pie, honey bunch
You know that I love you
Oh, I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else
Oh, you're in and out my life
You come and you go
Leavin just your picture behind
And I've kissed it one thousand times, hey, hey, hey, hey
Baby, everything is alright
Uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is alright
Uptight, out of sight
Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over
Oh, think it over
I tried so hard to be patient
Hopin you'd stop this infatuation
But each time you are together
I'm so afraid of losing you forever
Stop
You're sweet as a honey bee
But like a honey bee stings youve gone and left my heart in dreams
All you left is our favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
You used to bring sweet memories
Of a tender love that used to be
Now it's the same old song
But with a different meaning since youve been gone
Same old song
But with a different meaning since youve been gone
Love you, oh, baby
