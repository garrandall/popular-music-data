You all ready to kick?
C'mon
1-2-3
Swing it
Aw, yeah, baby
You're my fantasy
And I want everybody in the house to clap

Clap
Clap your hands
C'mon
And I want all the money fellas out there
To give me the dog move
When I count to three

Ready?
You all ready?
Here we go
1-2-3

Swing it
(Woof)
Aw, yeah
(Woof)
Aw, yeah
(Woof)
Aw, yeah
All the money major fellas
(Woof)

Oh, yeah
Do the dog
Do, do the dog
Now I want to introduce
Whose in the house tonight
Ready?

Guys in the house
Gene Griffin's in the house
RedHead in the house
Wreckx N Effect in the house
Today's in the house
And my man Zan in the house
Spike Lee's in the house
GR
Kicking it live


You're just a fantasy
(She's a fantasy)
Image in a magazine
(Image in a magazine)
I've seen the face before
(I've seen the face before)
Her body walks out of my door
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)


She's just a fantasy
Image in a magazine
I've seen the face before
Her body walks out of my door

Every time I close my eyes
What she gives me is said surprise
That body was so kicking
Hey fellas
It's just a thing I need

Girl, I’m like
A piece of my love when you spend the night
When you groove me, everything’s right
Call me crazy ‘because I’m in the game
Of ‘round and ‘round and manic paid
The jam with Teddy and the rest of Guy
Hello, Love and I said “Goodbye!”
Don’t clap, just D-A-N-C-E
With my fantasy

I wish my fantasy
Yeah
Could come true
My love fantasy


She's just a fantasy
(She's a fantasy)
Image in a magazine
(Image in a magazine)
I've seen her face before
(I've seen the face before)
Her body walks out of my door
(I like, I like yo!)

You're just a fantasy
(She's a fantasy)
Image in a magazine
(Image in a magazine)
I've seen her face before
(I've seen the face before)
Her body walks out of my door
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

You're just a fantasy
(Just a fantasy)
Image in a magazine
(Image in a magazine)
I've seen her face before
(I've seen the face before)
Her body walks out of my door
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

It's my fantasy
It's my fantasy
You're just my fantasy
