Murder Inc. shit
Uh... uh, uh, uh



Now every little thing that we do (that we do)
Should be between me and you (me and you)
The freaky things that we do (that we do)
Let's keep between me and you (me and you)
Cause every little thing that we do (that we do)
Should be between me and you (me and you)
The freaky things that we do (that we do)
Let's keep between me and you, ba-byyy


Yo...
Now when I first met her all I thought was "Thong thong-thong"
like, "Lose the lame, we can get our freakin on"
Baby know the game, slip away, and slide me yo' number
It's the last day of spring, see you first day this summer
I'm a bad motha; shut yo' mouth! Pull the drop out and
creep at a low speed, cause homey probably know me
I push the pedal, thoughts of your stilleto
way up in the air like I think he's here
Cause see, every time that I'm alone with you (with you)
Homey be checkin up on you (on you)
But if that nigga only knew (only knew)
You've got a lot of freak in you, ba-byyy
Well now it's startin to rain, I pop the roof and the champagne
How Jay said? "Money Ain't a Thing"
It's been close a few, at times even impossible
But, it's been between me and you, ba-byyy

Girl it's on again, every year - we hummer 'em in
Beaches, houses, hoes, foes, friends
And when the, day ends - that's when it all begins
You wit him? Here's my room key; holla at me
While you thinka-think I'ma hit it up
then look at the nigga you thinkin you love? C'mon love
We could go there, me and you, creep off all night
If you love it, in the mornin, awake with new light
If you lookin like I ain't gonna handle his
Let me handle my bizzz, it is what it is
Nigga livin his liiiife, and that's my bitch
You know I gotta wiiiife, let's keep this thing tight, ba-byyy

Don't let the word get out (shhh), ba-byyy
This is - strictly between me and you, ba-byyy
If they - knew we were doin what we were doin it'd probably ruin
our creep away summer in Cancun'n-and I, love
the way we get away, throw away a whole day
Turn off the pagers and phones, we in the zone like
"Fuck liife, we live liife
 This is our liife, live your liife"


Cause see, every time that I'm alone with you (with you)
Shorty be checkin up on you (on you)
But if baby girl only knew (only knew)
You've got a lot of freak in you, ba-byyy


Did I ever tell you, my man love what you do
That little thing with yo' tongue; you the best, who knew?
It's been close a few, at times even impossible
But, it's been between me and you, ba-byyy



(That we do)
(Me and you)
(That we do)
(Me and you)
(That we do)
(Me and you)
(That we do)
(Me and you)
