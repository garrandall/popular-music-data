Keep me in pain
Keep me in pain

I cried, I cried
My heart full of misery
Oh yes, I cried
And now it's your turn
To cry, to cry for me
Oh, help me now

So many days gone by (Oh yeah)
So many days gone by
All I, all I could ever
Seems like yesterday was cry
Sit right there

You keep me - do you know it?
You keep me in pain
'Cause I cried over you
And I'll never, I'll never
Never love again
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

I cried over you
Yes, I cried over you
But you know that
That I've always, without a doubt, been true
Been true, tell me what I'm singing, I'm singing (Soul)
Oh yes I am (Soul)

So listen to me
See where I'm coming from
Listen to my rap
So turn your record player down real low
Brother jockey, turn yours down, too

You know that I'm only human (Soul)
And if you see my, my little darling (Soul)
Tell her, tell her don't make me over (Soul)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Any day now
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
You all know what I'm singing (Soul)
Don't make me over, please (Soul)
And you got all the time you need to try me (Soul)
Don't make me over (Soul)

Don't make me over, please
When you got all the time
You need to try me
Don't make me over
