Jingle Bells
Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle Bells
Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bop tails ring
Making spirts bright
What fun it is to
Ride a sleighing song tonight

Jingle Bells
Ji, Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Ba la la la bop

Jingle Bells
Ji, Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bop tails ring
Making spirts bright
What fun it is to
Ride a sleighing song tonight

Jingle Bells
Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle Bells
Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle Bells
Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle Bells
Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
