Oh, I need to know where we stand
Do we share this special thing called love?
I know I do, what about you?
I just can't get enough of the time


I need you in my life
Where do we go?
What do I do?
I can't live without your love
Thinkin' of you, makes me feel
Like I am the only one for you


Girl, I want to be with you
No one else, only you
Why can't we just make it happen?
Baby, I need you in my life


Every time I'm with you
Never want it to come to an end
Always make me so happy
You'll always have a place in my heart


I need you in my life
Where do I go?
What do I do?
'Cause I can't live without your love
Thinkin' of you, makes me feel
Like I am the only one for you
(Check it out)


Je-sus, the Notorious just
Please us with your lyrical thesis
We just chillin', milk 'em, top billin'
Silk and pure linen, me and Little Cease
Malibu sea breeze, Dom P's, palm trees
Cats named Pablo in milked out Diablos (That's right)
The Williest, bitches be the silliest
The more I smoke, the smaller the phillie gets
Room 112 where the players dwell
And stash more cash than Bert Padell, inhale
Make you feel good like Tony Toni Tone (Feels good)
Dig up in your middle like Monie (Yes)
Don't know but your settin' up to blow me (Yes)
Try to style, fly up north with a homie (Yes)
Escada, Don Dada, player, stay splurgin'
Game so tight they call it virgin (Yes)


Where do we go
What must I do
If I can't live without your love
Thinkin' of you, makes me feel, baby
Like I am the only one for you


Girl, I want to be with you
No one else, only you
Why can't we just make it happen?
Baby, I need you in my life

Girl, I want to be with you
No one else, only you
Why can't we just make it happen?
Baby, I need you in my life
(Oh baby, I love you)

Girl, I want to be with you
(I need you, want you here with me)
No one else, only you
(It's only you)
Why can't we just make it happen?
Baby, I need you in my life

(Girl, I love you)
Girl, I want to be with you
(And I need you, gotta have you in my life, oh yes I do)
No one else, only you
Why can't we just make it happen
Baby, I need you in my life

Girl, I want to be with you
No one else, only you
