I got a little drunk last night
There's something 'bout a midnight rain
Staring at the ceiling fan
I couldn't get you off my brain

I guess I wasn't thinking straight
I couldn't tell wrong from right
I went ahead and called you up
I got a little drunk last night

Brought it all up, got it all out
What is it worth, to both of us now
It's off my chest, but never off my mind
Two drinks in, hit that hurt,
You feel bad, and I feel worse
I swear it's the last time every time
Don't know why

Might've been a song on the radio
Might've been nothing, baby I don't know
Might've been a little too tired to fight
Might've been I got a little drunk last night

I got a little too far gone
Heart was talking way too loud
I don't remember what I said
I just remember breaking down

Brought it all up, got it all out
What is it worth, to both of us now
It's off my chest, but never off my mind
Two drinks in, hit that hurt,
You feel bad, and I feel worse
I swear it's the last time every time
Don't know why

Might've been a song on the radio
Might've been nothing, baby I don't know
Might've been a girl who looked like you
Might've been a fluke, might've been a full moon
Might've been a little too tired to fight
Might've been I got a little drunk last night

Might've been a song on the radio
Might've been nothing, baby I don't know
Might've been a girl who looked like you
Might've been a fluke, might've been a full moon
Might've been a little too tired to fight
Might've been I got a little drunk

Brought it all up, got it all out
What is it worth, to both of us now
It's off my chest, but never off my mind
Two drinks in, hit that hurt,
You feel bad, and I feel worse
I swear it's the last time every time

I got a little drunk last night
I got a little drunk last night
Thought I could keep it all inside
But I got a little drunk last night
