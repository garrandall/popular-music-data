Wish on a rainbow
Is all I can do
Dream of the good times
That we never knew
No late nights alone in your arms
I'll dream on

Living in wonder
Thinking of you
Still looking for ways to uncover the truth
You're so young is all they can say
They don't know

If I could change the way of the world
I'd be your girl


Too many walls
Have been built in between us
Too many dreams
Have been shattered around us

If I seem to give up
They'll still never win
Deep in my heart
I know the strength is within


Watching the others
Chances drift by
They'll never discover these feelings I hide
Deep inside
I'm falling apart
All alone with a broken heart

Thinking in silence
Is all they allow
These words still unspoken may never be found
All these dreams one day will be mine
They cross my mind

My time has yet to come
Until then


Too many walls
Have been built in between us
Too many dreams
Have been shattered around us

If I seem to give up
They'll still never win
Deep in my heart
I know the strength is within

Oh yeah


Too many walls
Have been built in between us
Too many dreams
Have been shattered around us

If I seem to give up
They'll still never win
Deep in my heart
I know the strength is within

Too many walls
Have been built in between us
Too many dreams
Have been shattered around us

If I seem to give up
They'll still never win
Deep in my heart
I know the strength is within
