Standing here alone with you
Wondering what it is that I'm supposed to do
And there you are with the lovelight in your eyes
Your bridges are burnt down
Your arms are open wide
Am I in too deep or should I swim to the shore
Is this the real thing I don't know
But I've never been here before
And I feel a thunder in my heart
That I just can't control
I feel a thunder in my heart
Should I walk away or follow my soul
I feel a thunder in my heart
Where it comes from I just don't know
Oh no, oh no

There's a storm ragin' deep in my soul
There's a howlin' wind that I just can't control
There's a fire inside me I can't explain
Every time you touch me my love falls like rain
I've only known you for an hour or more
But the time is standin' still
Your love has opened up the door
I feel a thunder in my heart
It takes my breath away
I feel a thunder in my heart
Will I ever be the same
I feel a thunder in my heart
It's telling me you're here to stay
Oh no, oh no

There's a thunder in my heart
There's a thunder in my heart
There's a thunder in my heart
There's a thunder in my heart

Take me baby I'm all yours
Do just what you wanna do with my love
Let's not let the night overtake us
'Cos what's happening right now may make or break us
Do you feel the way I do
Open up your heart now baby
I'm coming' through
I feel a thunder in my heart
Takin' my breath away
I feel a thunder in my heart
Since I met you I'll never be the same
I feel a thunder in my heart
I know you're here to stay
I feel a thunder in my heart
And I know you're here to stay
