Never gonna let him know,never gonna let him,
Never gonna let him, never gonna let him
Know,never gonna let him never gonna let him
I know my man has been running around,yeah.
Yes, I can tell- I saw lipstick on his collar, he just got paid,
Don't even have a dollar he stayed out late,oh,oh
Telling me he's out with the guys,
But I know better by the look in his eyes,
But I'll never, no no no, I just can't let him know about it, no no.
I'm afraid we may have to part,
But I've got to hold on to half of his heart,yeah.
When he's supposed to meet I find myself alone,yeah.
He just keeps me waiting,
Keeps me waiting- I keep staring at the clock,
Getting madder by the minute, pace the floor,saying,"
This how it ends!
" Then he knocks on my door and he
Takes me in his arms and I'm a-his once more.
But I'll never,no no no, I just can't let him know about it,no no.
You see, I've got to try harder in every way I can for I'll
Never never never be happy, no no, with any other man,yeah.
I believe that someday my love will make him strong,
But until that day finally comes along, no I'll never,no no no,
I just can't let him know about it,
No no no no, I found lipstick on his collar last night,
I can't let him know,you see, I love that man so much, no no...
