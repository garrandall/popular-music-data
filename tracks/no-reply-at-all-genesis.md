Talk to me, you never talk to me.
Ooh, it seems that I can speak.
But I can hear my voice shouting out.
But there's no reply at all.

Look at me, you never look at me,
Ooh, I've been sitting, staring, seems so long.
But you're looking through me
Like I wasn't here at all.
No reply, there's no reply at all.

Dance with me, you never dance with me.
Ooh, it seems that I can move,
I'm close to you, close as I can get.

Yet there's no reply at all,
There's no reply at all.

I get the feeling you're tryin' to tell me,
Is there something that I should know?
What excuse are you tryin' to sell me?
Should I be reading stop or go, I don't know.

Be with me, seems you're never here with me,
Ooh, I've been trying to get over there.
Ah, but it's out of my reach.
And there's no reply at all.
There's no reply at all.

I get the feeling you're trying to tell me;
Is there something that I should know?
What excuse are you trying to sell me?
Should I be reading stop or go, I don't know.

Maybe deep down inside,
I'm trying for no one else but me.
Too stubborn to say, "The buck stops here.
It's not the one you're looking for."
But, maybe deep down inside,
I'm lying to no one else but me.
Oh but my back is up.
I'm on my guard - with all the exits sealed.

Listen to me, you never listen to me,
Ooh, and it seems there's no way out,
I've been trying, but we cannot connect,
And there's no reply at all,
There's no reply at all,
There's no reply at all,
No reply at all.

Is anybody listening - oh oh,
No reply at all...
