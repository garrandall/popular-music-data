Man put your hand in your pocket and give that baby some money
That  baby got to go to school and her got to buy his lunch at school
(That  ain't my baby)
Oh man I don't want to hear that you could look at that baby tell that's your baby
Baby got your head and your mouth and your nose
Now  you can stand in that line if you want to
But  that baby is your

Man that's your baby, yeah
Man  that's your baby, yeah
It looks just like you, yeah

You can't deny it, no
You  can't deny it, no
So don't you try it, no
So don't you try it, no

That baby's got your head and your nose
You ought to buy that baby some clothes
If you don't think that baby is yours
Just ask the mother
Just ask the mother
She knows (hot dang it)
She knows

Man that's your baby, yeah
Man that's your baby, yeah
You think you're false accused
You think you're false accused
But don't go to court dog
Don't go to court dog
Cause man you are gonna lose

This baby's got your mouth and your eyes
So you should stop telling them lies
If you don't think that baby is yours
Just ask the mother
Just ask the mother
She knows (I bet you)

Man you recognize this baby
What you think about it
Sure that's his baby
Look at that baby's eyes and his eyes
Look at that baby's ears and his ears, same ears
Look at the big feet on that baby look at his big feet
Same big feet

Yeah that baby's his baby
Give that baby a nickel or dime or a quarter
A hamburger or something
Put the baby in the car and drive him to school man
Don't stand around that baby
