Another long and sleepless night 
You need someone to hold you tight 
Sometimes love don't know wrong from right 
Another long and senseless 
Fight was all you knew they're all the same 
There's no one left to take the blame 
What's behind this masquerade 
How do we win these losin' 
Games we play, words we say 
Cutting wounds we know they run so deep 
Leave it all behind you 
Or someday love will find you 


Only lonely -- I can't stop hurting you 
Only lonely -- but I can't stop loving you 
Only lonely -- how much pain does it take 

It's getting sometimes I don't know 
When to stop when to go 
Sometimes we're so afraid to let it show 
A stolen kiss so out of place 
It wipes the smile right off your face 
And when those feelings start 
We let them go, let them go 

Games we play, words we say 
Cutting wounds that run so deep 
Leave it all behind you 
Or someday love will find you 

Only lonely -- I can't stop hurting you 
Only lonely -- but I can't stop loving you 
Only lonely -- so tell me babe, how much pain 
can you take before your heart breaks? 

I got this timebomb ticking in my head 
This time I think she's gonna blow 
How can I say get away 
When I just can't let go 

Games we play, words we say 
Cutting wounds that run so... 
Leave it all behind you 
Or someday love will find you
