Hm, hm, there's no pity in the naked city, yeah
When you're all alone
And all your hard-earned money's gone
There just ain't no pity
No no no, in the naked city, yeah
Help me now, hm mmm
You'll go walking down Broadway
Watching people catch the subway
Take it from me
Don't ask for a helping hand
'Cause no one will understand
Ah, there's no pity
No no no, in the naked city, yeah
Ohhh help me now, mmm mmm
Folks there's no no? nice
It's the only place I know where hearts turn to ice
You can? neighbor next door
Or smile at someone?
Don't live there no more
Bright lights will find you
And they will mess you around
Let me tell you
Millions will watch you
Have mercy now
As you sink right down to the ground
I found no pity, no no no, in the naked city, yeah
Come on help me now
There's no pity!
No no no, in the naked city, yeah
