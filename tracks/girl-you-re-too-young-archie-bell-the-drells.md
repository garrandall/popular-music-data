You're just a baby
(Girl, you're too young) oh, yeah
(Your mama won't allow it)
No, she won't now

(Girl, you're too young)
(Your papa shout about it)
Yes, he will now

I know you need someone
Someone to hold your hand
How in the world can I
Hold your hand when
Your folks just don't understand

(Girl, you're too young) oh, yeah
(Come back later) later, baby
(Girl, you're too young) oh, girl
(Don't make your people hate us)
Don't make your people hate us

You're just a little schoolgirl
Growing up mighty fast
Let's not get started
Cause how long do you
Think this love can last

(Girl, you're too young) oh, yeah
(Your mama won't allow it)
No, she won't now

(Girl, you're too young)
You're too young, girl
(Your papa shout about it)
Yes, he will now, oh, yeah

(Girl, you're too young)
You're too young, girl
(Your mama won't allow it)
It'd mess you up now

Don't you know
You're too young, baby
(Girl, you're too young)
(Your papa shout about it)
Yes, he will now

Too young, baby
Yes, they're gonna
Shout about it
Come on, girl...
