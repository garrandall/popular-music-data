Simona
You're getting older
Your journey's been
Etched on your skin
Simona
Wish I had known that
What seemed so strong
Has been and gone

I would call you up every Saturday night
And we'd both stay out 'til the morning light
And we sang, "Here we go again"
And though time goes by
I will always be
In a club with you
In 1973
Singing "Here we go again"

Simona
Wish I was sober
So I could see clearly now
The rain has gone
Simona
I guess it's over
My memory plays our tune
The same old song

I would call you up every Saturday night
And we'd both stay out 'til the morning light
And we sang "Here we go again"
And though time goes by
I will always be in a club with you in 1973
Singing "Here we go again"

I would call you up every Saturday night
And we'd both stay out 'til the morning light
And we sang "Here we go again"
And though time goes by
I will always be in a club with you in 1973
Singing "Here we go again"

I would call you up every Saturday night
And we'd both stay out 'til the morning light
And we sang "Here we go again"
And though time goes by
I will always be in a club with you in 1973
Singing "Here we go again"

And though time goes by
I will always be
In a club with you
In 1973
