Baby, is he looking after you?
Is he showing you the same love, the warm love
Just like we knew?

Baby, baby, it's you I'm thinking of
In the morning when I wake up
In the evening, it's you that I dream of

Sometimes love hurts, and sometimes love's unkind
And sometimes you might feel blue
But remember now, darling, if his words are real
This will never, never happen to you

Baby, baby, there's things I'd like to say
I was hoping that with our love
We would get married someday

Baby, baby, it's you I'm thinking of
In the morning when I wake up
In the evening, it's you that I dream of

Sometimes love hurts, and sometimes love's unkind
And sometimes you might feel blue
But remember now, baby, if his words are real
This will never, never happen to you

Baby, baby, there's things I'd like to say
I was hoping that with our love
We would get married someday
