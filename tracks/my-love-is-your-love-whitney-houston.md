Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright (Turn me up, turn me up, turn me up)
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright


If tomorrow is judgement day (Sing mommy)
And I'm standing on the front line
And the Lord ask me what I did with my life
I will say I spent it with you
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright (It's alright)
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright


If I wake up in World War 3 (World War 3)
I see destruction and poverty
And I feel like I wanna go home
It's okay if you're comin' with me
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright (It's alright)
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright


'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us


Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright


If I lose my fame and fortune
And I'm homeless on the street (On the street, oh Lord)
And I'm sleepin' in Grand Central Station (Oh okay)
It's okay if you're sleepin' with me
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright


As the years, they pass us by (The years, the years, the years)
We stay young through each other's eyes (Each other's eyes)
And no matter how old we get, oh
It's okay as long as I got you, babe
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright


'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us


If I should die this very day (Very, very day)
Don't cry, 'cause on Earth, we weren't meant to stay
And no matter what people say (Really don't matter)
I'll be waiting for you after judgement day


'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us


Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright
Clap your hands
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright
Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright
