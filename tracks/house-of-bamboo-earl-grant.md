Number fifty-four,
The house with the bamboo door,
Bamboo roof and bamboo walls,
They've even got a bamboo floor!

You must get to know Soho Joe,
He runs an Expresso,
Called the House of Bamboo.

It's a made of sticks.
Sticks and bricks,
But you can get your kicks
In the house of bamboo.

In this casino,
You can drink a chino,
And it's gotcha swingin' to the cha cha
Dance the bolero in a sombrero.
Shake like a snake!

You wanna stop in when the cats are hoppin'.
Let your two feet move-a to the big beat;
Pick yourself a kitten and listen to a platter
That rocks the juke-box!

I'm-a telling you,
When you're blue,
Well there's a lot to do
In the House Of Bamboo.

Lets go go!
You must get to know, Soho Joe,
He runs an Expresso,
Called the House of Bamboo

In this casino, you can drink a chino
Let your two feet move-a to the big beat;
Pick yourself a kitten and listen to a platter
That rocks

I'm-a telling you,
When you're blue,
Well there's a lot to do
In the House Of Bamboo.

Number fifty-four,
The house with the bamboo door,
Bamboo roof and bamboo walls,
They've even got a bamboo floor!
