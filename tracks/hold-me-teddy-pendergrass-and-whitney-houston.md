I'll hold you and touch you and make you my woman
I'll give you my love with sweet surrender
Tonight our hearts will beat as one
And I will hold you, touch you
And make you my woman tonight

There's something in your eyes I see
A pure and simple honesty

Hold me in your arms tonight
Fill my life with pleasure
Let's not waste this precious time
This moment's ours to treasure

Hold me in your arms tonight
We'll make it last forever
When the morning sun appears
We'll find our way together

I believe you when you say that you love me
Know that I won't take you for granted
Tonight the magic has begun
So won't you hold me, touch me
Make me your woman tonight

There's something in your eyes I see
I won't betray your trust in me

Hold me in your arms tonight
Fill my life with pleasure
Let's not waste this precious time
This moment's ours to treasure

Hold me in your arms tonight
We'll make it last forever
When the morning sun appears
We'll find our way together

I'll hold you and touch you
And make you my woman tonight

Hold me in your arms tonight
Fill my life with pleasure
There's something in your eyes I see
Let's not waste this precious time
This moment's ours to treasure

Hold me in your arms tonight
We'll make it last forever
Something in your eyes I see
When the morning sun appears
We'll find our way together

Hold me in your arms tonight
Fill my life with pleasure
There's something in your eyes I see
Let's not waste this precious time
This moment's ours to treasure

Hold me in your arms tonight
We'll make it last forever
There's something in your eyes I see
When the morning sun appears
We'll find our way together
