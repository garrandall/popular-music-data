I can't go on living
Baby, without you
No, no, no
I can't go on living
Baby, without you

Without your love
I can't go on
Without you here
All my dreams would be gone

I can't go on living
Baby, without you
(I can't go on living, baby)
I can't go on loving
Baby, I need you
(I can't go on living, baby)

I need your kiss
(I need your kiss)
My whole life through
(My whole life through)
There is no me without you

Don't want nobody elses
Lips touching you
(Don't want nobody elses lips)
Don't want no one to feel
The sweet things that you do
(Don't want to feel the sweet)

Can't you see, can't you see
My love is real
And this feeling deep inside
Is a burning I can't hide

So true
I don't want to live without you

I can't go on living
Baby, without you
(I can't go on living, baby)
I can't go on loving
Baby, without you
(I can't go on living, baby)

Without your love
(Without your love)
My world is through
(My world is through)
There is no me without you

Can't you see, can't you see
My love is real
And this feeling deep inside
Is a burning I can't hide

So true
I don't want to live without you
I can't live without you

I can't go on living
Baby, without you
(I can't go on living, baby)
No, no, no
I can't go on loving
Baby, without you
(I can't go on living, baby)

I can't go on living
Baby, without you
(I can't go on living, baby)
I can't go on breathing
Baby, without you
(I can't go on living, baby)
