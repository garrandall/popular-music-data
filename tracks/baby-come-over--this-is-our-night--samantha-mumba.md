Baby, come on over tonight
We can make it all right
Take a piece of my heart
And go from the start


You say that you want me
Again and again
You say that you need me
To be more than just your friend
So I thought about it
And maybe you're right
I've been checking your records
And they seem all right


Baby, come on over tonight
We can make it all right
Take a piece of my heart (My heart)
And go from the start
Baby, come on over tonight (Yeah, yeah)
We can make it all right (Yeah, yeah)
Boy, there's no one like you (Ooh)
Do you feel it too? (Do you feel it too?)


Baby, come over, come on
Baby, come over, ah
This is our night tonight


So when we get together
If just for a while
Let's make it happen
Don't waste any time
And now I need to find out
What you're about
So come over tonight
Let's sort this out


Baby, come on over tonight (Yeah, yeah)
We can make it all right (make it all right)
Take a piece of my heart (My heart)
And go from the start
Baby, come on over tonight
We can make it all right (make it all right)
Boy, there's no one like you (Yeah)
Do you feel it too?
Baby, come on over tonight (baby, I'm waiting, there's no hesitating now)
We can make it all right
Take a piece of my heart
And go from the start
Baby, come on over tonight (La da da da da)
We can make it all right (La da da da da)
Boy, there's no one like you
Do you feel it too?


Baby, come over
Baby, come over
Come on over tonight
Yeah, yeah


This is our night tonight
Everything's gonna be alright
This is our night tonight
Everything's gonna be alright
This is our night tonight (Baby, come on over tonight)
Everything's gonna be alright
This is our night tonight
Everything's gonna be alright


Baby, come on over tonight (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We can make it all right
Take a piece of my heart (Of my heart)
And go from the start
Baby, come on over tonight
We can make it all right (Baby)
Do you feel it too? (Do you feel it too?)
Baby, come on over (this is our night tonight, ooh)
Everything's gonna be alright
This is our night tonight
Everything's gonna be alright (Baby, come on over)
This is our night (tonight, we can make it all right)
(Gonna be, gonna be)
Boy, there's no one like you (Oh yeah yeah yeah)
Do you feel it too?


Baby, come over
This is our night tonight
Baby, come over
