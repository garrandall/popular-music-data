When you smile
You're so adorable
So infantile
Just like a little child

Because you smile
Just like a baby
Just like a baby

When you frown
You look so helpless
That I sympathize
When I look in your eyes

I start to cry
Just like a baby
Just like a baby

Unpredictable
But irresistable
Sometimes I don't know
What to do with you, yeah

I've grown accustomed to
The thrill of of loving you
And like a baby
I'll take care of you
I will, I will

I start to cry
Just like a baby
Just like a baby, yeah

When I hold you, you make
Me feel so very wonderful
Oh, you're so lovable

Because you feel
Just like a baby
Just like a baby
Hey, I know, I know

Oh, you feel
So very wonderful now
Oh, daddy needs a baby
Mmm, baby needs a daddy now

I know, I know
Everybody needs somebody, girl
And I'm no different than the rest
