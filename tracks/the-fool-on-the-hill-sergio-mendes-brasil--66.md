Day after day alone on the hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

Well on his way his head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking percetly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice
But the fool on the hill
Nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings
But the fool on the hill
