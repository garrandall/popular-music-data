We don’t have time left to regret (Hold on)
It will take more than common sense (Hold on)
So stop your wondering, take a stand (Hold on)
There's more to life than just to live (Hold on)


'Cause an empty room can be so loud
It's too many tears to drown them out
So hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on


One single smile, a helping hand (Hold on)
It's not that hard to be a friend (Hold on)
So don’t give up, stand till the end (Hold on)
There's more to life than just to live (Hold on)


'Cause an empty room can be so loud
It's too many tears to drown them out
So hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
When you love someone and they break your heart
Don’t give up on love, have faith, restart
Just hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on


When it falls apart
And you're feeling lost
All your hope is gone
Don’t forget to hold on, hold on


'Cause an empty room can be so loud
It's too many tears to drown them out
So hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
When you love someone and they break your heart
Don’t give up on love, have faith, restart
Just hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on


'Cause an empty room can be so loud
It's too many tears to drown them out
So hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
When you love someone and they break your heart
Don’t give up on love, have faith, restart
Just hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
