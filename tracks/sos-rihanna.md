La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, oh
(You know, I've never felt like this before) Oh, oh
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, oh
(This feeling's like... so real) Oh, oh


I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive, just one thought ain't close enough
You got me stressin', incessantly pressin' the issue
'Cause every moment gone, you know I miss you
I'm the question and you're of course the answer
Just hold me close boy, 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken, I'm never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me callin' out for help


S-O-S, please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are makin' this hard
I can't take it, see, it don't feel right
S-O-S, please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are makin' this hard
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night


This time please, someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testin' me, but still, I'm losin' it
This time please, someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losin' it


Just your presence and I second guess my sanity
Yes, it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots and when I see you, it gets so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock
Take on me (Uh-huh), you know inside you feel it right
Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight
I melt with you, you got me head over heels (Over heels)
Boy, you keep me hangin' on, the way you make me feel


S-O-S, please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are makin' this hard (Y-O-U are)
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night


This time please, someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it ('Cause you on my mind)
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testin' me, but still, I'm losin' it
This time please, someone come and rescue me (Someone come and rescue me)
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losin' it


Boy, you know you got me feelin' open
And boy, your love's enough with words unspoken
I said boy, I'm tellin' you, you got me open
I don't know what to do, it's true
I'm goin' crazy over you, I'm beggin'


S-O-S, please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are makin' this hard (Why you makin' this hard for me, baby?)
You got me tossing and turning, can't sleep at night
This time please, someone come and rescue me (Someone rescue me)
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testin' me, but still, I'm losin' it


This time please, someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losin' it (All of the time)
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losin' it (Best of me, I'm losin' it )


La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, oh
Oh, oh
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, oh
Oh, oh
