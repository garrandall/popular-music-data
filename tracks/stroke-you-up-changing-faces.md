Relax baby, I'm gonna make you feel real good
Tonight is your night, come here
Let's get this shirt off
Now tell me what you like
Cause I make it everything you want
Now come closer
Uh-uh closer
Don't be scared, touch me, right there
Yeah right there, oh yeah, uhh, you go boy


You asked for me
So whatcha wanna see me for

I wanna show you something

Oh yeah and what's that

Turn the lights down half way

Huh, hey yo that's cool


 Do you mind if I stroke you up (I don't mind)
Do you mind if I stroke you down (I don't mind)
All through the night (I don't mind)
Until your body's tired
Do you mind if I stroke you up (I don't mind)
Do you mind if I stroke you down (I don't mind)
All through the night (I don't mind)
Makin' you feel so right

C'mon in and close the door
I've got what you're looking
Dim the lights, unplug the phone

And turn the radio on
I've got what you need
Just put your trust in me
And I won't let you down
So give me your love right now

 Give it up (That's what I wanna do)
Keep it comin (Don't stop)
I've got a question for you



I know the things to do
To make you feel alright
Giving you all of me
And keepin' you satisfied
Boy there's no mystery
You know how I feel right now
I want to lift you up
And make your love come down

Do you mind if I? (oh yeah baby)
Does it feel good? (yeah) C'mon (uh)
Up and down, up and down (stroke me baby)
Up and down (yeah)
