(Ridin' roads)

Uh, yeah
This town ain't got no nightclub
We don't need the neon lights
Girl, I got that '87 gassed up
30 early out there in your drive
Got you a bullet in a koozie, keep it ice cold
You take a sip 'fore we get gone
Lookin' at you with your hand out the window
I'm turnin' right while you're turnin' me on, yeah

Ridin' roads that don't nobody go down
A little trip through the country side
These 38s makin' the world go 'round
I hit a curve just to make you slide
Only light is a flashing yellow
Only thing that I want is your kiss
I'm lovin' nothin' to do with you, baby
Just ridin' roads on a night like this

(Ridin' roads)

Out there where the moon hits the water
Out there where your lips hit mine
I don't know where we are
'Cause somebody stole the streets signs
I'ma take my sweet time, yeah
'Cause I could go on forever
With you there ridin' shotgun, yeah
All our friends are probably makin' plans, baby
Yeah, but we already got one

We'll be ridin' roads that don't nobody go down
A little trip through the country side
These 38s makin' the world go 'round
I hit a curve just to make you slide
Only light is the flashing yellow
Only thing that I want is your kiss
I'm lovin' nothin' to do with you, baby
Just ridin' roads on a night like this

Just ridin' roads on a night like this

(Ridin' roads)

I got one hand on the wheel
And I got the other tryna cross the line, line, line
Yeah, the way you make feel
I wanna keep it rollin' 'til the sun rise, rise, rise

Ridin' roads that don't nobody go down
A little trip through the country side
These 38s makin' the world go 'round
I hit a curve just to make you slide
Only light is the flashing yellow
Only thing that I want is your kiss
I'm lovin' nothin' to do with you, baby
Just ridin' roads on a night like this

Just ridin' roads on a night like this

(Ridin' roads)
