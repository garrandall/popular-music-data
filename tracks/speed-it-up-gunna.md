Hold on, hold on, speed it up, hold on
(Run that back, Turbo)


Speed it up, speed it up
Eat it up, eat it up
Eat it up, speed it up
Speed it up (Hold on, hold on)
Beat it up (Hold on, hold on)
Speed it up (Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on)
Speed it up (Hold on)
Speed it up, high... speed it up


Scotty Hotty (Scotty 2 Hotty)
Jolly wallet (Giant wallet)
Cheddar, cottage (Got cheddar and cottage)
Good brain, college (Good brain)
Her frame, body (Her frame)
Mulsanne, bought it (Mulsanne)
My plane, private (Private)
Diamond chain, wallets (Wallets)
No shame, I got it (I got it)
Couple plain watches (Watches)
I lay in Versace (Versace)
The hate, can't stop it


Speed it up, speed it up
Eat it up, eat it up
Eat it up, speed it up
Speed it up (Hold on, hold on)
Beat it up (Hold on, hold on)
Speed it up (Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on)
Speed it up (Hold on)
Speed it up, high... speed it up


Godly, baby
Katie, coupe, Mercedes
Wheezy, wavy, eyes lazy (Huh?)
My life's crazy (It's crazy)
A price, pay me (Pay me)
My eyes, HD (HD)
My eyes, 3D (3D)
I'm high, geeking (Geeked)
I lied at the precinct (At the precinct)
I didn't sign a 360 (A 360)
I got mine, not greedy (Not greedy)
I'm in the ride, speedin'


Speed it up, speed it up
Eat it up, eat it up
Eat it up, speed it up
Speed it up (Hold on, hold on)
Beat it up (Hold on, hold on)
Speed it up (Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on)
Speed it up (Hold on)
Speed it up, high... speed it up
