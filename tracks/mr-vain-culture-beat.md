Call him Mr. Raider
Call him Mr. Wrong
Call him Mr. Vain

Call him Mr. Raider
Call him Mr. Wrong
Call him insane


He'd say: I know what I want
And I want it now
I want you, cause I'm Mr. Vain
I know what I want
And I want it now
I want you, cause I'm Mr. Vain


Call me raider, call me wrong
Call me insane, call me Mr. Vain
Call me what you like
As long as you call me, time and again
Feel the presence of the aura
Of the man, none to compare
Loveless dying
For a chance just to touch a hand
Or a moment to share
Can't deny the urge, that makes them
Want to lose themselves to the debonair one
Hold me back, the simple fact is
That I'm all that, and I'm always near
One sexy can't perplex me
Now you know who's raw
As if you didn't know before
I know what I want, and I want it now
I want you, and then I want a little more


Call him Mr. Raider
Call him Mr. Wrong
Call him Mr. Vain

Call him Mr. Raider
Call him Mr. Wrong
Call him insane


He'd say: I know what I want
And I want it now
I want you, cause I'm Mr. Vain
I know what I want
And I want it now
I want you, cause I'm Mr. Vain

Mr. Wrong
Mr. Wrong
Mr. Raider


Girls all over the world
They hope, and pray, and die for men like me
Cause I'm the one, begotten son
That breaks the mold, get a look at male epitome
Style has never seen
That makes you want to grab, and hold, and squeeze real tight
Who's gonna be the one to save you from yourself
When you wanna take a bite
Please, oh baby, please
You beg, you want to stay, you got to get some
Caught up in the charm, that I laid on thick
And now there's nowhere to run
Just another fish to pick the worm on the hook of my line
Yeah, I keep many
Females longing for a chance to win my heart
With S.E.X. and plenty


Call him Mr. Raider
Call him Mr. Wrong
Call him Mr. Vain

Call him Mr. Raider
Call him Mr. Wrong
Call him insane


He'd say: I know what I want
And I want it now
I want you, cause I'm Mr. Vain
I know what I want
And I want it now
I want you, cause I'm Mr. Vain


Call him Mr. Raider
Call him Mr. Wrong
Call him Mr. Vain

Call him Mr. Raider
Call him Mr. Wrong
Call him insane


He'd say: I know what I want
And I want it now
I want you, cause I'm Mr. Vain
I know what I want
And I want it now
I want you, cause I'm Mr. Vain


Call him Mr. Raider
Call him Mr. Wrong
Call him Mr. Vain

Call him Mr. Raider
Call him Mr. Wrong
Call him insane


He'd say: I know what I want
And I want it now
I want you, cause I'm Mr. Vain
I know what I want
And I want it now
I want you, cause I'm Mr. Vain


I know what I want
And I want it now
I want you, cause I'm Mr. Vain
I know what I want
And I want it now
I want you, cause I'm Mr. Vain
