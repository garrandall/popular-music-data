Girl I've never seen you in this town
If you need somebody to show you around, well
I know somebody
It's a little too loud to talk in here
And your eyes are sayin' you wanna disappear, well
I know a place and I know somebody

Somebody with a gassed up truck sittin' right outside
It's ready to roll if you're ready to ride
Sunroof open with the moonlit sky
Yeah, I know a guy
I know somebody that's lost all in your smile
That can love you like a song on the radio dial
If that's what you want tonight
I know somebody, and you're lookin' right in his eyes
I know somebody (I know somebody), I know somebody (I know somebody),
I know somebody

I'm lovin' the way you act so shy
Like you ain't sure, like you can't decide
But I heard you tell your friends that you know somebody
That makes you laugh, that can get you home
That might make you fall âfore the night is gone
So come on, you know I'm that somebody

Somebody with a gassed up truck sittin' right outside
It's ready to roll if you're ready to ride
Sunroof open with the moonlit sky
Yeah, I know a guy
I know somebody that's lost all in your smile
That can love you like a song on the radio dial
If that's what you want tonight
I know somebody, and you're lookin' right in his eyes
I know somebody (I know somebody), I know somebody (I know somebody),
I know somebody

That's lookin' for a girl like you
Could fall in a kiss or two
Baby tell me what you wanna do
Cause I know

Somebody with a gassed up truck sittin' right outside
It's ready to roll if you're ready to ride
Sunroof open with the moonlit sky
Yeah, I know a guy
I know somebody that's lost all in your smile
That can love you like a song on the radio dial
If that's what you want tonight
I know somebody, and you're lookin' right in his eyes
I know somebody, I know somebody
I know somebody, I know somebody
I know somebody, and you're lookin' right in his eyes
I know somebody, I know somebody
I know somebody, I know somebody
I know somebody
