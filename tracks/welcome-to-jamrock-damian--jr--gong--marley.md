Out in the streets, they call it murder

Welcome to Jamrock, camp where the thugs them camp at
Two pounds a weed inna van back
It inna your hand bag, your knapsack, it inna your back pack
The smell a give your girlfriend contact

Some boy nuh know this, dem only come around like tourist
On the beach with a few club sodas
Bedtime stories, and pose like dem name Chuck Norris
And don't know the real hardcore

'Cause Sandals a now back too, the thugs
Dem will do whe dem what them got to
And won't think twice to shot you
Don't make them spot you, unless you carry guns a lot too
A bare tuff things come at you

When Trenchtown man stop laugh and block-off traffic
Then dem wheel and pop off and dem start clap it
With the pin file dung and it a beat rapid
Police come inna jeep and them cant stop it

Some say them a playboy a playboy rabbit
Get dropped like a bad habit
So don't bother pose off if you don't have it
Rastafari stands alone!

Welcome to Jamrock, welcome to Jamrock
Out in the streets, they call it murder!

Welcome to Jamdown, poor people are dead at random
Political violence, can't done! Pure ghost and phantom,
The youth dem get blind by stardom
Now the king of kings a call

Old man to Pickney, so wave one hand if you with me
To see the sufferation sick me
Dem suit no fit me, to win election dem trick we
And them don't do nuttin' at all

Come on let's face it, a ghetto education's basic
And most a the youths them waste it
And when they waste it, that's when they take the guns, replace it
Then them don't stand a chance at all

And that's why ah nuff little youth have up some fat 'matic
With the extra magazine inna dem back pocket
And a bleach a night time inna some black jacket
All who nah lock glocks, at dem a lock rocket

Them will full you up ah current like ah shock circuit
Dem a run a road block which part the cops block it
And from now till a mornin' not stop clock it
If they run outta rounds a bruck back ratchet

Welcome to Jamrock (Southside, Northside)
Welcome to Jamrock (East Coast, West Coast, huh, yo)
Welcome to Jamrock (Cornwall, Middlesex & Surrey) Hey!
Welcome to Jamrock
Out in the streets, they call it murder!
Jamaica Jamaica! Jamaica Jamaica! Now!
Jamaica Jamaica! Yo! Jamaica Jamaica!
Welcome to Jamrock, Welcome to Jamrock
