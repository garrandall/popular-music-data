She dunno that she's a lucky girl
Got the best thing in the whole wide world
Got a love that's hard to find
But the boy I wish was mine


She's a fool
She's a fool
She has his love but treats him cruel


He dunno it but she cheats on him
With a boy like that, it's such a sin
I would never be untrue
I would never make him blue

I know there's gonna come a day
He will tell the girl, 'Be on your way,'
Maybe then he'll turn to me
Then how happy I will be that
