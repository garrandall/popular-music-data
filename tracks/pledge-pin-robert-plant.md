Watch them go 'cause one by one they rise to fall
Hearts in tow, it's just a game - she's only having fun
She laughs and turns away surprised
She mocks it all the same
Tonight's the loss tomorrow's gain and in the end it's so

Stand in line as one by one they march in time
In the wings I stand and watch these foolish things go by
Just preparing for the play aloof she moves
The confidante, with practiced step
The merry dance she executes her role

As the cavalcade begins to thin, do you stop and look around
Free to choose but not to win - you're just too late
Your show is at an end - now you're the victim of your game
Through your fingers watch them slip
Familiar rules just hit and miss for the one who never shows
