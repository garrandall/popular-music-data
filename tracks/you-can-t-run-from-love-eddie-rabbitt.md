I took a plane around the world,
Trying to loose her memory
But every where that I touched down
I found it waiting there for me

You can, t run from love, there's just no place
In this world you can hide
You can, t run from love,
When it's looking for you all you can do is
Give up.

Sail across the seven sea's
Climb apon the mountian high
Build a wall around your heart
It's going to find you every single time

You can travel in a time machine,
Disapear without a trace
It won't matter where you go
It's going to find you any place

You can travel in a time machine,
Disapear without a trace
It won't matter where you go
It's going to find you any place.

You can't run from love there's just no place
In this world you can hide
You can't run from love ooooo
You can't run from love there's just no place
In this world cause I've tried

You can't run from love ooooooo
You can't run from love (fade out)
