It's so hard lovin' you
But I don't wanna let you go
Little darlin' I need you (Little darlin' I need you)
Little darlin' I love you (Little darlin' I love you)
Little darlin' I want you (Little darlin' I want you)
Little darlin' I've got to have you (Little darlin' I've got to have you)
And if it means giving up my life
I'm going to give it up (give it up) give it up
There's always one who loves more than the other
But I don't mind, I don't mind
I'm willing to pay the price
Have your love at any sacrifice

Little darlin' I need you...

I know there's two or three in your life
You like as well as me
So if I have to be your #1 fool
Before you care, care about me
Then I'm willing to pay the price
Be your #1 fool, make that sacrifice
Oh baby

Ooo hoo, only my finger knows how many tears I've cried, baby
Only my heart knows the awful hurt I feel inside, baby
My life is so lonely, waiting for you to love me only
Now I'm willing to pay the price
Be your #1 at any sacrifice

Little darlin' I need you...
