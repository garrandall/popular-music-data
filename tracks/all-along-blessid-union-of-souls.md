Seems like yesterday but years have passed us by
Precious memories are clear before my eyes
I can hear your voice calling out my name
But I don't know you now, nothing stays the same

All along I have wanted you
I pray tonight that you want me, too
All along there was no one else
I've been waiting here all by myself

If you were here with me we'd ride the ocean tide
To that special place I held for you deep inside
I've kept good company since you've been away
Lonely stayed with me and pride began to fade

All along I have wanted you
I pray tonight that you want me, too
All along there was no one else
I've been waiting here all by myself

And I will follow you til the end of time
Til our love is at the end of the line
You rolled out of my life just like the wind
And left behind a broken heart

All along I have wanted you
I pray tonight that you want me, too
All along there was no one else
I've been waiting here all by myself
