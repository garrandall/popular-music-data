I wasn't myself
There for a while
There was a tear in my half smile
That you could see a mile away

I had to change
I didn't mind
Truth is it was about time
And there was no way I was
Losing you

So I want you to know
I'm gonna show
The better side of me

I want you to see
The man underneath
The better side of me

Come look inside
You're gonna find
The better part of me

I'm not the same 
Person you knew
The one that used to hurt you
I had to leave him far behind

So it's safe to fall
Into my arms
Knowing I will catch you
Cause I want to give you 
Peace of mind

So wherever we go
I'm gonna show
The better side of me

I want you to be
The first one to see
The better side of me

Looking in my eyes
And there you will find
The better part of me

And I just want to apologize for wasting so much time
When all along I knew that there was only
You for me

So from this moment on
You can hold on
To the better side of me

You can believe
That you're gonna see
The better side of me

Deep in your eyes
That's where I find
The better part of me
