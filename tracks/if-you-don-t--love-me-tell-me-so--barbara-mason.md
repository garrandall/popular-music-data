If you really love me, baby
Like you say you do
Why don't you tell me so
If you really do
And if you really need me, baby
Like you say you do
Why don't you let me know
If you really do
I really love you
Honest, I do
If you believe in me
If you believe in me
If you don't, if you don't
If you don't
Why don't you tell me so
(Tell me so, tell me so)
I'm gonna love you
Until my dying day
If you don't believe me
Why don't you say
I hope that some day
You know that I've been true
And if you don't believe me
What should I do
If you believe in me
If you believe in me
If you don't, if you don't
If you don't
Why don't you tell me so
(Tell me so)
Why don't you let me know
(Let me know)
I really love you
You know that I need you
If you believe in me
If you believe in me
If you don't, if you don't
If you don't
Why don't you tell me so
(Tell me so)
Why don't you let me know
(Let me know)
I really love you
You know that I need you
I really want you
You know that I need you
I really want you
I really love you...
