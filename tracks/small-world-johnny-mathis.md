Funny, you're a stranger who's come here,
come from another town.
Funny, I'm a stranger myself here.
Small world, isn't it?

Funny, you're a man who goes traveling
rather than settling down.
Funny, 'cause I'd love to go traveling.
Small world, isn't it?

We have so much in common,
it's a phenomenon.
We could pool our resources
by joining forces from now on.

Lucky, you're a man who likes children.
That's an important sign.
Lucky, I'm a woman with children.
Small world, isn't it?
Funny, isn't it small and funny and fine?

We have so much in common,
it's a phenomenon.
We could pool our resources
by joining forces from now on.

Lucky, you're a man who likes children.
That's an important sign.
Lucky,
You're a
woman with children.
Small world, isn't it?
Funny, isn't it
isn't it
small and funny and fine?
