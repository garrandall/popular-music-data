Radio!
I wake up in the morning
The first sound that I hear
Is that clock radio (Radio) singing in my ear
I make it to the bathroom to brush my teeth
To that big city big beat
Jump into the shower, bring my box along
'Cause I know all the words to all the songs
Dj stops the music to announce the time
Time has come today

Grabbed my coat and grabbed my hat
Made my train in seconds flat
All the time I'm listening to my radio

Around the block, to the corner
You can hear it all night long
On the roof and out on Broadway
When the radio is on
You can rock around the clock
Because you know the beat goes on
They'll be dancing in the streets
Because the radio is on

My whole life long has been one big song
But all my parents ever said was "Turn it down"
Even with my homework blasting out the cool jerk
Living for the latest sound
And every special event, has a particular tune
That's the way that I remember everything I do
My first romance ohwe used to dance to the man with the Blue Suede shoes

From the eastside to the westside
Uptown funk and downtown soul
I go downtown and I'm listening to my radio

Around the block, to the corner
You can hear it all night long
On the roof and out on Broadway
When the radio is on
You can rock around the clock
Because you know the beat goes on
They'll be dancing in the streets
Because the radio is on

Radio! Radio

Well you can't sit out, when the air waves howl
It's been that way since the Wolfman growled
Jitterbug, Twist, Watussi too, the swim, the pony and the boogalo
And while the sounds have changed, the radio still rules
Now we moondance down to electric avenue
Breakin, snakin', doing the worm, New York radio makes the world turn

Around the block, to the corner
You can hear it all night long
On the roof and out on Broadway
When the radio is on
You can rock around the clock
Because you know the beat goes on
They'll be dancing in the streets
Because the radio is on

Around the block, to the corner
You can hear it all night long
On the roof and out on Broadway
When the radio is on
You can rock around the clock
Because you know the beat goes on
They'll be dancing in the streets
Because the radio is on
