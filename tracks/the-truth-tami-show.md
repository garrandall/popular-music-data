I don't want something complicated baby
I just want something simple like the truth

Now's the time, this time I'm going to take a stand
Call me honestly only if you show your hand
Don't keep walking away, today we got to work it out now, understand
Give me yours, I'll give you mine, put your heart on the line

I don't want something complicated baby
Just want something simple like the truth
I don't want something fabricated baby
Just want something simple like the truth

Hot love, cold lies, can't you find a compromise
Good bad, never had anything but troubled times
And how come every time I need a little sincerity, it's such a crime
Give me yours, I'll give you mine, put your heart on the line

I don't want something complicated baby
Just want something simple like the truth
I don't want something fabricated baby
Just want something simple like the truth

Look in my eyes don't look away
Look in my eyes
Hey... Hey... Hey... Hey...
I don't want something complicated baby

I don't want something complicated baby
Just want something simple like the truth
I don't want something fabricated baby
Just want something simple like the truth

Not complicated... like the truth
Not fabricated... like the truth
Not educated don't want it complicated
Not calculated... like the truth
