We're falling in love, my darling
With all our heart and soul
Let's put our love somewhere
For the whole world to behold

A love like ours
Must have a special place
I've got the answer, baby
Let's wear it on our face
Let's wear it on our face

Love is bubbling over, baby
Flowing everywhere
Our hearts can't hold no more
And it's got to go somewhere
Whoa, yeah

A love like ours
Must have a special place
I've got the answer, baby
Let's wear it on our face
Let's wear it on our face

This love's got to go somewhere
This love's got to go somewhere
This love's got to go somewhere
This love's got to go somewhere

Yeah, yeah, yeah...

I've got the answer
Let's wear it on our face

A love like ours
Got to go someplace
Look at the answer, baby
Let's wear it on our face

This love's got to go somewhere
This love's got to go somewhere
This love's got to go somewhere
This love's got to go somewhere

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
We've got the answer
Let's wear it on our face
Oh, yeah

A love like ours
Got to go someplace
Look at the answer, baby
Let's wear it on our face
Oh, yeah (on our face now, hey)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
We've got the answer
Let's wear it on our face
