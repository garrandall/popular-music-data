Why are you in so much hurry
Is it really worth the worry
Look around
Then slow down

What's it like inside the bubble
Does your head ever give you trouble
It's no sin
Trade it in

Hang on, help is on its way
I'll be there as fast as I can
Hang on, a tiny voice did say
From somewhere deep inside the inner man

Are you always in confusion
Surrounded by illusion
Sort it out
You'll make out

Seem to make a good beginning
Someone else ends up winning
Don't seem fair
Don't you care

Hang on, help is on its way
I'll be there as fast as I can
Hang on, a tiny voice did say
From somewhere deep inside the inner man

Don't you forget who'll take care of you
It don't matter what you do
Form a duet, let him sing melody
You'll provide the harmony

Why are you in so much hurry
Is it really worth the worry
Look around
Then slow down

What's it like inside the bubble
Does your head ever give you trouble
It's no sin
Trade it in

Hang on, help is on its way
I'll be there as fast as I can
Hang on, a tiny voice did say
From somewhere deep inside the inner man

Hang on, help is on its way
I'll be there as fast as I can
Hang on, a tiny voice did say
From somewhere deep inside the inner man
