Want love? Get closer
You want love? Get closer
Hold her hand, be forward
Come on, be a man, get closer

Instead of worrying about those things you said
Follow your heart and forget your head
Maybe some things will jump out your mouth
Make her notice that you're crazy about her

Want love? Get closer
You want love? Get closer

You make a fuss when her eyes ain't on you
Well give her something to look forward to
Remember all those other girls who ran
Away from something they didn't understand

You want love? Get closer
You want love? Get closer

Why you worrying about those things you said
Follow your heart and forget your head
Oh, slide over on the seat
She'll give you something that's oh so sweet
