Spread it on thick,
Like peanut butter and jam.
Spread your lovin' on me, baby,
Anywhere, any time that you can.

Spread it on thick,
Like peanut butter and jam.
Spread it on me, baby,
And I'll show you what a lover I am.
Yeah...

Spread it on thick,
Like honey on an old bumble bee.
Spread it and I'll show you,
What a lover I was brought up to be.

Spread it on thick,
Like? on the ground (?)
Spread it and I'll show you,
Spread it on me baby and I'll show you,
What a lover you found.

Are you a man!

I'm the man!

Are you!

Listen to me!

Lay it on thick,
And I'll show you,
That I am your man!

Spread it on thick,
Like peanut butter and jam.
If you have a half a chance,
Won't you spread it all over again.

Spread it on thick,
Like peanut butter and jam.
Spread it on me, baby,
And I'll show you what a lover I am.
Yeah...

Are you a man!

I'm the man!

Are you sure you're the man!

Yeah, I'm your man!

Spread it on me,
And I'll show you,
That I am your man!

Spread it on thick,
Like peanut butter and jam.
Spread it on me, baby,
And I'll show you what a lover I am.
