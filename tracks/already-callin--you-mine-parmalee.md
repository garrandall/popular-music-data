I barely know you, you barely know me
We ain't but two slow dances into this thing
Come on and sit down, I'll order us a round
I want to know everything. Girl, where's your hometown?
Are those your momma's eyes?
What are you doing for the rest of your life?

Cause I'm already thinking bout you and me getting out of here and taking a drive
Just slide a little closer, put your head on my shoulder like this ain't our first time
Girl, don't worry bout holdin' on tight cause I'm already calling, I'm already calling you mine

Whoa, whoa

I know that there's a chance
I'm thinking too fast. Tell me, tell me am I right or am I reading this wrong?
They'll play the last song, the lights will come on, that don't mean we can't take the long way home, home, home

Cause I'm already thinking bout you and me getting out of here and taking a drive
Just slide a little closer, put your head on my shoulder like this ain't our first time
Girl, don't worry bout holdin' on tight cause I'm already calling, I'm already calling you mine

If you like the way that sounds, we can leave this place right now, right now

Cause I'm already thinking bout you and me getting out of here and taking a drive
Just slide a little closer, put your head on my shoulder like this ain't our first time
Girl, don't worry bout holding on tight cause I'm already calling, I'm already calling you mine

Whoa, whoa. I'm already calling you mine. Whoa, whoa
