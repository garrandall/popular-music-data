If you getting mugged from everybody you see
Then hang over the wall of the VIP like

(Fly!) This-a-way (fly!) that-a-way


Yeah, uh-huh, alright, alright
Now I was bouncing through the club
She love the way I Diddy-bop
I see her boyfriend hatin' like a city cop
Now I ain't never been a chicken but my fifty cocked
Say I ain't never been a chicken but my semi cocked
Now where your bar at? I'm tryin' to rent it out
And we so 'bout it 'bout it, now what are you about?
DJ show me love, he say my name when the music stop

Now clap your hands if you got a bankroll (Chris)
Like some clap on lights in this bitch
I'mma be clappin' all night in this bitch
Lights off, mask on
Creep silent, she smiling
He muggin', who cares
'Cause my goons are right here
Like it's nothing to a big dog
And I'm a Great Dane, I wear eight chains
I'm in so much ice, they yell "Skate, Wayne!"
She wanna fuck Weezy, but she wanna rape Wayne
(And I'mma let her)

Bring an umbrella, please bring an umbrella
'Ella, 'ella, 'ella, ayy!
Bitch ain't shit but a ho and a trick
But you know it ain't trickin' if you got it
You know we ain't fuckin' if you not thick
And I'll cool your ass down if you think you're hot shit
So Rolex watch this, I do it, four, five, six
My click-clack goes the black four-fifth
And just like it I'll blow that shit
'Cause bitch I'm the bomb like tick, tick
Biatch!
