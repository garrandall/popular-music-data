All my dreams became reality
From the first day
That our love came to be
And all the pain
Disappeared from sight
I want you more and more
I need you day and night

Then came you
Then came you

There was no time when
Not a day was hard to face
'Cause in my heart
There was an empty space
A feeling of needing someone
Here next to me
How could you tell girl
How could you see

That I had waited for a girl like you
To give me the love
That I never knew
You took me by the hand
And made me understand
You wanted me to be your only man

Then came you
All my dreams became reality
Then came you
From the first day that
Our love came to be
Then came you
All of the pain
Disappeared from sight
Then came you
I want you more and more
I need you day and night
Then came you

You know baby
Instead of a false love
You were my only true love

There's just so much more
That I want to say
Sometimes emotions get in the way
You can be sure your heart
Is safe in my hands
I ask no questions
I make no demands

Just come along with me
And baby you will see
That this is the way
Love's supposed to be
All these words I say are true
My life was empty girl

Then came you
All my dreams became reality
Then came you
From the first day that
Our love came to be
Then came you
All of the pain
Disappeared from sight
Then came you
I want you more and more
I need you day and night
Then came you

And all my dreams became reality
Then came you
From the first day that
Our love came to be
Then came you
And all of the pain
Disappeared from sight
Then came you
I want you more and more
I need you day and night

Man I've had it up to here
And I'm fed up
I search here and there
Yo don't let up
Mama told me there'd be days like this
You put your love on the line
And like to take risks
Colorblind, trying to find a new heart
My hearts broken and drained
You need a jumpstart
Looking for love
A love so true
My life was empty and then came you

Girl my life was empty
You know that much was true
And I was searching for true love

Then came you
All my dreams became reality
Then came you
From the first day that
Our love came to be
Then came you
All of the pain
Disappeared from sight
Then came you
I want you more and more
I need you day and night
Then came you

And all my dreams became reality
Then came you
From the first day that
Our love came to be
Then came you
And all of the pain
Disappeared from sight
Then came you
I want you more and more
I need you day and night
