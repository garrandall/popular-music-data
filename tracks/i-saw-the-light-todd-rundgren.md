It was late last night
I was feeling something wasn't right
There was not another soul in sight
Only you, only you

So we walked along
Though I knew that there was something wrong
And a feeling hit me, oh so strong
About you

Then you gazed up at me
And the answer was plain to see
'Cause I saw the light
In your eyes, in your eyes

Though we had our fling
I just never would suspect a thing
Till that little bell began to ring
In my head, in my head

But I tried to run
Though I knew it wouldn't help me none
'Cause I couldn't ever love no one
Or so I said

'Cause my feelings for you
Were just something I never knew
Till I saw the light
In your eyes, in your eyes

But I love you best
It's not something that I say in jest
'Cause you're different, girl, from all the rest
In my eyes

And I ran out before
But I won't do it anymore
Can't you see the light in my eyes
In my eyes
In my eyes
In my eyes
