Lonely boy
Keep playing on
Your lonely guitar

Though she left you
And you're feeling bad
Dry your dreamy eyes
And don't be sad
You will learn
To love again some day

Now take your guitar
And play and play and play
Play and play and play
Play and play and play
Lonely boy

Da da da da, oh...
Ah, ah, ah, ah...
Lonely boy

Lonely boy
Keep playing on
Your lonely guitar

Though she left you
And you're feeling bad
Dry your dreamy eyes
And don't be sad
You will learn
To love again some day

Now take your guitar
And play and play and play
Play and play and play
Play and play and play
Lonely boy
