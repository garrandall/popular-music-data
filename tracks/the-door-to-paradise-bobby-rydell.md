Here we are so close to Heaven
Can't you see it in my eyes
Will you love me or forsake me
For only you can take me
Through the door to paradise

If you tell me that you love me
You can take me to skies
Say the word and we will be there
For you can turn the key, dear
To the door to paradise

Here we stand, hand in hand
Won't you give a little sign
Make me know you understand
You're willing to be mine, all mine

Kiss me sweet and touch me tender
I'll surrender to your sighs
Tell me this is love forever
And then we'll walk together
Through the door to paradise

(Paradise, paradise, ooh)

Make me know you understand
You're willing to be mine, all mine

Kiss me sweet and touch me tender
I'll surrender to your sighs
Tell me this is love forever
And then we'll walk together
Through the door to paradise

Through the door to paradise
