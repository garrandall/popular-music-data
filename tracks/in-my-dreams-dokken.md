Toss and turn all night in the sheets
I can't sleep
Night after night don't know what it means
In my dreams

What can I say or do
You won't come back, we're through
I've realized too late
That, baby, your love has turned away

In my dreams--it's still the same
Your love is strong, it still remains
In my dreams--you're still by me
Just the way it used to be

Calling your name, but you're turning away
Please don't leave
Running in circles, waiting to see you
In my dreams

What can I say or do
You won't come back, we're through
I've realized too late
That, baby, your love has turned away

In my dreams--it's still the same
Your love is strong, it still remains
In my dreams--you're still by me
Just the way it used to be

In my dreams--it's still the same
Your love is strong, it still remains
In my dreams--you're still by me
Just the way it used to be

In my dreams--it's still the same
Your love is strong, it still remains
In my dreams--you'll always be
In my heart and in my dreams
In my dreams--it's still the same
In my dreams--you're still by me
In my dreams--just the way it used to be
In my dreams--what can I say
In my dreams--You're still by me
And in my dreams--You'll always be
In my dreams--You'll always be
In my dreams--your love is strong
In my dreams--You're still the same
In my dreams
