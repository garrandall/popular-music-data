Blown 'round by the wind
Thrown down in a spin

I gave you love, I thought that we 
Had made it to the top
I gave you all I had to give
Why did it have to stop?

You've blown it all sky high
By telling me a lie
Without a reason why
You've blown it all sky high

You, you've blown it all sky high
Our love had wings to fly
We could have touched the sky
You've blown it all sky high

Up, 'round, I've flown
Then down, down like a stone

I gave you love, I thought that we 
Had made it to the top
I gave you all I had to give
Why did it have to stop?

You've blown it all sky high
By telling me a lie
Without a reason why
You've blown it all sky high

You, you've blown it all sky high
Our love had wings to fly
We could have touched the sky
You've blown it all sky high

You, you've blown it all sky high
By telling me a lie
Without a reason why
You've blown it all sky high
