Well...

You're gonna miss me
Early in the mornin'
One of these days ... oh, yeah...

Well ... you're gonna want me
Early in the mornin'
When I'm away ... don't ya know

Yes ... you'll be sorry
For the times I cried
You'll be sorry
For the time you lied

Well ... you're gonna miss me
Early in the mornin'
One of these days ... whoa, yeah

Well ... ya know a rollin' stone
Don't gather no moss
And you cross your bridge
When it's time to cross

Well ... you broke my heart
When you said goodbye
Now the milk is spilt
But you're gonna cry

Yeah ... early in the mornin'
You're gonna know
That I was right ... oh, yeah ... yeah

Well ... early in the mornin'
When there's nobody
To hold you tight ... oh, oh

Well ... you're gonna want me
Want me bad
You're gonna miss
The best man you ever had
Yes... you're gonna miss me
You're gonna want me
One of these days

Whoa, don't ya know ... yeah

Oh, yeah

Well ... you're gonna want me
Want me bad
You'll miss the best man
You ever had
Well ... you're gonna miss me
You're gonna want me
One of these days ... oh, yeah...

Early in the mornin'...
Early in the mornin'...
Early in the mornin'...
