Ring the living bell
Ring the living bell
Shine the living light
Shine the living light
Ring the living bell
Ring the living bell

I been celebrating 'way too long
An' I've been drinkin', I'm ashamed to tell
Still feel thirsty
God I want to drink the water from the well
Still feel thirsty
God I want to drink and ring the living bell
Ring the bell, ah
Ring the living bell
Still feel thirsty
God, I want to give and ring the living bell

I'm not a magic lady
But I want to sing to help the light
Descend on the earth today
Because it's gonna get dark tonight
Sing the light, ah
Sing the living light
Still feel weak, but God
I want to give and shine the living light
Still feel weak, but God
I want to give and shine the living light

Been walking down the street all night
An' I been feeling kinda cold
Still feel naked
God I want to be warm before I get old and I'm cold
Ah, and I'm feeling cold
Still feel hungry
God I want to give and ring the living bell
Still feel hungry
God I want to live and ring the living bell

Been celebrating 'way too long 'n' I have eaten much too well
Still feel hungry
God I want to give and ring the living bell
Ring the bell, ah
Ring the living bell
Still feel hungry
God I want to give and ring the living bell
Still feel hungry
God I want to give and ring the living bell
Still feel hungry
God I want to give and ring the living bell
Ring the living bell

Ring the living bell, ring the living bell
Shine the living light
