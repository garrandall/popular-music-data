I want it all (Hey, yeah), I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now


Adventure seeker on an empty street
Just an alley creeper light on his feet
A young fighter screaming with no time for doubt
With the pain and anger, can't see a way out


"It ain't much I'm asking," I heard him say
"Got to find me a future, move out of my way"


I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now


Listen, all you people, come gather 'round
I gotta get me a game plan, gotta shake you to the ground
Just give me what I know is mine
People, do you hear me? Just give me the sign


It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth
Here's to the future for the dreams of youth


I want it all, I want it all (Give it all, I want it all)
I want it all, and I want it now (Hey)
I want it all, I want it all (Yes, I want it all, hey)
I want it all, and I want it now


I'm a man with a one-track mind
So much to do in one lifetime (People, do you hear me?)
Not a man for compromise
And 'wheres' and 'whys' and living lies
So I'm living it all (Yes, I'm living it all)
And I'm giving it all (And I'm giving it all, oh, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)




It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth
Here's to the future, hear the cry of youth
(Hear the cry, hear the cry of youth)


I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all (Hey, yeah, yeah)
I want it all, and I want it now (Oh oh)
I want it now


I want it, I want it!
Oh, huh!
