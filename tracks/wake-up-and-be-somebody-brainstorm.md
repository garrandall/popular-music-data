Wake up and be somebody
(Wake up and be somebody)
Get up and be someone
(Get up and be someone)

Wake up and be somebody
(Wake up and be somebody)
Under the morning sun
(Keep your eye on the sun)


Wake up and be somebody
Get up and be someone
Wake up and be somebody
There's room for everyone

Don't let it get you down
When you think that
You can't get around
Don't let the day drag on
You've got to move to
The happy sound



I know it's hard to see
All of the brand new possibilities
But if you're here with me
Then we can live, love and
Always be free, can't you see



Wake up and be somebody
(Get up and be someone)
Get up and be someone
(Wake up and be somebody)

Wake up and be somebody
(Under the morning sun)
Keep your eye on the sun
(Wake up and be somebody)

(Get up and be someone)
Get up and be someone
(Wake up and be somebody)
Wake up and be somebody
(There's room for everyone)



Wake up and be somebody
Wake up...
