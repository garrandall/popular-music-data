It's hard to realize we've said our last goodbyes
Where could the dream have gone to
Now I know there's no way that I can make you stay
No matter how I want to

We made some memories that my heart will always treasure
Before you close the door let's make one more

Baby, just for tonight let me give myself to you
And all I ask is just for tonight love me like you used to do
And I promise that I won't cry, I won't ask you why
I won't even try to change your feelings
If you just hold me tight, just once more, just for tonight

I thought the love we found
Was built on solid ground
And it would just grow stronger yeah
Crazy as it may seem
I need to dream the dream
For just, just a little longer
So for the sake of all that magic we made together
Open your heart to mine just one more time

Baby, just for tonight let me give myself to you
And all I ask is just for tonight love me like you used to do
And I promise that I won't cry, I won't ask you why
I won't even try to change your feelings
If you just hold me tight, just once more, just for tonight baby, oh

All I want is one more night, yeah
So why don't you come to me let me dream?
This night means everything to me
All I ask is for tonight
Baby just hold me tight. Yeah...
Come to me, let me dream
This night means everything to me
