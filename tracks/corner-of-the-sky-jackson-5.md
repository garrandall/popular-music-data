Everything has its season
Everything has its time
Show me a reason
And I'll soon show you a rhyme
Cats sit on the window sill
Children sit in the show
Why do I feel
I don't fit in anywhere I go

Rivers belong where they can ramble
Eagles belong where they can fly
I've got to be where my spirit can run free
Gotta find my corner of the sky

Every man has his daydreams
Every man has his goal
People like the way dreams have of sticking to the soul
Thunder comes after lightning
Nightingales have their song
And don't you see I want my life
To be something more than none

Rivers belong where they can ramble
Eagles belong where they can fly
I've got to be where my spirit can run free
Gotta find my corner of the sky
Of the sky

So many men seem desperate
'Cause they got something small
But I, I won't rest
Until I know I have it all
So don't ask where I'm goin'
But listen when I'm gone
Always you'll hear me singin'
Softly to the dawn

Rivers belong where they can ramble
Eagles belong where they can fly
I've got to be where my spirit can run free
Gotta find my corner of the sky
Rivers belong where they can ramble
Eagles belong where they can fly
(Fly, oh)
I've got to be where my spirit can run free
(Gotta find)
Gotta find my corner
(Gotta find)
Gotta find my corner, yes, I do
(Gotta find)
Gotta find my corner
(Gotta find)
Gotta find my corner of the sky
