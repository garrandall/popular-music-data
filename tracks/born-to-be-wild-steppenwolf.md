Get your motor runnin'
Head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
In whatever comes our way


Yeah, darlin', go and make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space


I like smoke and lightnin'
Heavy metal thunder
Racing with the wind
And the feeling that I'm under


Yeah, darlin', go and make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space


Like a true nature's child
We were born, born to be wild
We can climb so high
I never wanna die
Born to be wild
Born to be wild

Get your motor runnin'
Head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
In whatever comes our way


Yeah, darlin', go and make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space


Like a true nature's child
We were born, born to be wild
We can climb so high
I never wanna die
Born to be wild
Born to be wild
