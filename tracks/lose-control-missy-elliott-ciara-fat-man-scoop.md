Music make you lose control
Music make you lose control

Let's go!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Here we go now, here we go now, here we go now, here we go now
Watch out now (Music make you lose control)
Misdemeanor's in the house
Ciara's in the house
Misdemeanor's in the house
Fatman Scoop-man Scoop-man Scoop

I got a cute face, chubby waist
Thick legs, in shape
Rump shakin', both ways
Make you do a double take
Planet rocker, show stopper
Flow proper, head knocker
Beat scholar, tail dropper
Do my thang, motherfucker
My Rolls Royce, Lamborghini
Blue Madena, always beamin'
Rag top, chrome pipes
Blue lights, outta sight
(Long weave) sewed in
(Say it again) sewed in
Make that money, throw it in
Booty bouncin', gone head

Everybody here, get it out of control
Get your backs off the wall
'Cause Misdemeanor said so
Everybody (Just throw your hands in the air!)
Everybody (Just throw your hands in the air!)
Everybody (Just throw your hands in the air!)
Everybody

Well my name is Ciara, for all you fly fellas
No one, can do it better (she'll sing on acapella)
Boy the music makes me lose control (Now bring it back now!)

We gon' make you lose control
And let it go, 'fore you know, you gon' hit the flo'
I rock to the beat til I'm (tired)
I walk in the club it's (fire)
Get it crunk and wired
Wave your hands scream (louder)
If you smoke then fire it up
Brang the roof down and (holla)
If you tipsy stand up
DJ turn it (louder)

Take somebody by the waist and (uhh!)
Now throw it in they face like (uhh!)
Hypnotic robotic, this here will rock yo' bodies
Take somebody by the waist and (uhh!)
Now throw it in they face like (uhh!)
Systematic ecstatic (This hit be automatic)

Work me, work, work
Work me, work, work
Work me, work, work
Work me, do it right
Hit the floor, hit the floor
Hit the floor, hit the floor
Hit the floor, hit the floor
Hit the floor

Everybody here, get it out of control
Get your backs off the wall
'Cause Misdemeanor said so
Everybody (Just throw your hands in the air!)
Everybody (Just throw your hands in the air!)
Everybody (Just throw your hands in the air!)
Everybody

Everybody here, get it out of control
Get your backs off the wall
'Cause Misdemeanor said so
Everybody (Get your back off the wall)
Everybody (Get your back off the wall)
Everybody (Get your back off the wall)
Everybody

Now put your back on the wall, put your back on the wall
Put your back on the wall, put your back on the wall

Misdemeanor's in the house
Yeah, Ciara's in the house
Misdemeanor's in the house (Music make you lose control)

We on fire, we on fire, we on fire, we on fire
Now throw it girl, throw it girl, throw it girl, yes
Now move your arms to the left girl
Now move your arms to the left girl
Now move your arms to the right girl
Now move your arms to the right girl
Let's go now, let's go now, let's go now, Woo! Let's go

Should I bring it back right now?
Now bring it back down!
Woo! Oh, I see you C
Now see, I'mma I'mma do it like C do it
Now shake it girl, c'mon and just shake it girl
C'mon and let it pop right girl, c'mon and let it pop right girl
Now, now, now back it up girl, back it up girl
Back it up girl, back it up girl
Woo! Woo! Woo! Yo, yo
Bring it to the front girl, yo, yo
Bring it to the front girl, yo, yo
Bring it to the front girl, yo, yo
Bring it to the front girl, let's go, let's go
