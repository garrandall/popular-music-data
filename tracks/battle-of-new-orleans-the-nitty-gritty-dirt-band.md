In 1814 we took a little trip,
Along with colonel jackson down the mighty mississip.
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans,
And we fought the bloody british in the town of new orleans.

We fired our guns and the british kept a comin',
There wasn't 'bout as many as there was awhile ago.
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
On down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico.

Oh we looked down the river and we seen the british come.
There must have been a hundred of 'em beatin' on a drum.
They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring.
We stood behind our cotton bales and didn't say a thing.

Old hickory said we could take 'em by surprise,
If we didn't fire our muskets till we looked 'em in the eyes.
We held our fire till we seen their faces well,
Then we opened up our squirrel guns and gave 'em a little...well...we...

...fired our guns and the british kept a comin',
There wasn't 'bout as many as there was awhile ago.
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
On down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico.

We fired our cannons till the barrels melted down,
Then we grabbed an alligator and we fired another round.
We filled his head with cannonballs and powdered his behind,
And when we touched the powder off, the gator lost his mind.

We fired our guns and the british kept a comin',
There wasn't 'bout as many as there was awhile ago.
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
On down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico.

We fired our guns and the british kept a comin',
There wasn't 'bout as many as there was awhile ago.
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
On down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico.
