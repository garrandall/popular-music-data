It's hard to tell the story of our love
Or how it all began
But suddenly a girl and boy became
A woman and a man

For there we were alone at last
Two hearts that heaven made to blend
So now let's live the story of our love
A story that will never end

For there we were alone at last
Two hearts that heaven made to blend
So now let's live the story of our love
A story that will never end
