UH! Looka here, ha
There was a day, there was a time
When I used to play
There was a time when I used to prance
But dig me now, baby, don't worry about later
Dig the dance I used to do
They call it Mashed Potatoes, OH

There was a dance, now dig this, ha
There was a dance, they call the Jerk
Everybody relax and watch me work, OH

In my hometown where I used to stay
The name of the place is Augusta, GA
Down there we have a good time
We don't talk
We all get together, any type of weather, then we do the Camel Walk, OH

Looka here, dig this
Now, there was a dance that I used to do
The name of the dance, ha they call the Boogaloo
I may not do the dance as well as you, ha
But baby, you can bet your bottom dollar
You'll never hear me holler
I'll do the best that I can do, OH

Looka here, feeling good
There was a time, sometimes I dance, looka here
Sometimes I dance, sometimes I clown
But you can bet you haven't seen nothing yet
Until you see me do the James Brown, OH
