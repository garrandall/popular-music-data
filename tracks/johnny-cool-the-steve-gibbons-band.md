Okay
Get ready

This is a ballad of Johnny Cool

Yes he was singing rough rockin
Drivin a smooth Rolls
Bought a big house and
Sold his new soul
He had a good time
Blowing his gold
Rock and roll Johnny
Rock and roll Johnny Cool

Well he made a right move and he met the right friend
Hit the right road and turned a right bend
He broke all the rules you just can't mend
Rock and roll Johnny
Rock and roll Johnny Cool

Johnny Cool ran drank fifty slugs of whisky a day
Johnny Cool was fast and loose
Johnny Cool was always up on top of the world
Flying like a rockin goose
Fly, Johnny‚ fly

Johnny cool got busted
He trusted a fool
So Johnny Cool went on the run
Johnny Cool could do just what he wanted to do
Johnny Cool could carry a gun (bad news)

You know he made a wrong move and he met the wrong friend
He hit the wrong road‚ turned the wrong bend
Picked up that gun and blew out his brains
Rock and roll Johnny
Rock and roll Johnny cool
Rock and roll Johnny
Rock and roll Johnny Cool
Rock and roll Johnny
Rock and roll Johnny Cool
