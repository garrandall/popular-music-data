I don't wanna lose you
I don't want you walking away
We're so good together
Tell me it's forever
'Cause I want you to stay

I'll be damned if
I'm living without you
And as long as I live
You will know

I just wanna build
My world around you
Don't want you to go

Don't leave me here
With my restless heart
The one you fill with the emotion
Baby right from the start
'Cause the hardest part is being alone
With my restless heart
Hm, with my restless heart

Tell me where you want me
Anytime, I don't care
Tell me when you need me
'Cause baby when you need me
I will be right there
(I will be right there)

I'll be damned if
I'm living without you
And as long as I live
You will know

I will never build
A wall around you
And I don't want you to go

Don't leave me here
With my restless heart
The one you fill with the emotion
Baby right from the start
And the hardest part is being alone
With my restless
With my restless
With my restless heart

I'll be damned if
I'm living without you
And as long as I live
You will know

I just wanna build
My world around you
I don't want you to go

Don't leave me here
With my restless heart
The one you fill with the emotion
Baby right from the start
'Cause the hardest part is being alone
With my restless
With my restless
With my restless heart

Don't leave me here
With my restless heart
The one you fill with the emotion
Baby right from the start
'Cause the hardest part is being alone
With my restless heart
With my restless

Don't leave me here
With my restless heart
The one you fill with the emotion
Baby right from the start
'Cause the hardest part is being alone
With my restless
With my restless
With my restless heart
