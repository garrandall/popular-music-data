This that new fire man!
Dark child!
Disturbing Tha Peace!
Shareefa!
Here's another one
Luda!
I told 'em we just getting started man
Ay yo I don't think they really understand what this is
Bring that back!
Ay, Shareefa where you at baby?
Let's go!


Come wit it, need somebody that's real gansta
Ain't a toy soldier, a real gangsta
Playa, holdin' me down like an anchor
I need a pappi, somebody I call daddy
Hustla, any hood he's a boss-a
Trapper, under the rugs he got stacks-a
Never see movies, don't like them actors
That's just what I go after
That's what I need


I-I-I-I-I-I
I be buggin'
Cuz all these fakes thugs is tryna press up
I need a boss like (hey!)
Who's flossing like (hey!)
Tossin' dough (hey!)
You know that he'll (pay!)
I-I-I-I-I-I
I be buggin'
Cuz all these fake thugs is tryna press up
I need a boss like (hey!)
Who's flossing like (hey!)
Tossin' dough like (hey!)
That drives me crazy!

Hey yo Dark child, bring that back!


Stop it, anything I want I cop it
I just want somebody to get fly wit
I got what I need, but can you top it?
Yes I'm a hot chick, somebody you can ride wit
Got hips, all the boys want me to drop it
So thick, niggas be buggin, I own it
I may be young, but I know what I want
If you show me baby, you can get on
So come on

That's just one of the things I need
Only one I'm pleasing is me
Unpredictable, yeah that's me
I can't help it, that's so sexy


I-I-I-I-I-I
I be buggin'
Cuz all these fakes thugs is tryna press up
I need a boss like (hey!)
Who's flossing like (hey!)
Tossin' dough (hey!)
You know that he'll (pay!)
I-I-I-I-I-I
I be buggin'
Cuz all these fake thugs is tryna press up
I need a boss like (hey!)
Who's flossing like (hey!)
Tossin' dough like (hey!)
That drives me crazy!


I'm the number one hustler of the century
S-s-see me in your dreams
I'm the boss of all bosses
K-k-king of all kings
I'm your favorite rapper's idol
I been had the title
Call me hot 16 wit more verses than the Bible
15 bank accounts, 10 different businesses
5 different lawyers, tell 'em what the business is
I live down the block, was raised up the street
Want beef? I'll do like summertime and raise up the heat
I'm the leader of the pack, plus I'm still in the slums
Man I was built Ford tough, I'm as real as they come
But fake thugs love to hate, some punks be ice grillin' me
Cuz I g-g-got assets, no liabilities
Now to infinity, grown women be feelin' me
And they ain't got nothin' to lose but they virginity
Still the Lova Lova, so give me a couple rubbers
I'll get 'em in a room, and Luda will make 'em studder like..


I-I-I-I-I-I
I be buggin'
Cuz all these fakes thugs is tryna press up
I need a boss like (hey!)
Who's flossing like (hey!)
Tossin' dough (hey!)
You know that he'll (pay!)
I-I-I-I-I-I
I be buggin'
Cuz all these fake thugs is tryna press up
I need a boss like (hey!)
Who's flossing like (hey!)
Tossin' dough like (hey!)
That drives me crazy!
