Should have told you by now, but I can't find the words, oh no
If I could show you somehow, but I don't have the nerve, oh yeah

You don't see me looking at you, how can love be so blind
Somehow you don't notice me, sooner or later there will come a time, baby

If you needed somebody, the way that I need you
If you wanted somebody, the way that I want you

Oh yeah, the way that I want you

If I could hold you tonight, it would last me forever
But the time's never right, when will we be together, oh no

If I could make you understand, what you're doing to me
Maybe there will come a time, when sooner or later I will make you see, baby

If you needed somebody, the way that I need you
If you wanted somebody, the way that I want you

Oh, if I could tell you now, the way you make me feel
Oh, if I could show you somehow, don't you know my lovin' is oh so real

If you needed somebody, the way that I need you
If you wanted somebody, the way that I want you

(If you needed somebody) I need you, I want you, I gotta tell you
The way that I need you
And if you wanted somebody, the way that I want you...
