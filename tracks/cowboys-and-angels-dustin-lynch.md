There's a want and there's a need
There's a history between
Girls like her and guys like me
Cowboys and angels

I've got boots and she's got wings
I'm hell on wheels and she's heavenly
I'd die for her and she lives for me 
Cowboys and angels


We ride side by side
A cloud of dust, a ray of light
My touch is her temptation
Her kiss is my salvation
She's sweet, I'm wild, we're dangerous
Cowboys and angels

Not sure why her path crossed mine
Accident or grand design
Ah maybe God just kinda likes
Cowboys and angels


We ride side by side
A cloud of dust, a ray of light
My touch is her temptation
Her kiss is my salvation
She's sweet, I'm wild, we're dangerous
Cowboys and angels

There's a want and there's a need
There's a history between
Girls like you and guys like me
Cowboys and angels
Cowboys and angels
