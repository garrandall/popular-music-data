When I need lovin' and I'm feelin' blue
Her warm, sweet lips know just what to do
It's then she starts to tease me
Before she starts to please me
I don't mind, no no no
I don't mind, no no no

Because she loves me, she tells me so
She loves me, won't let me go
She loves me, it's easy to see
My love only goes for me
My love only goes for me

She likes the feelin' that my lovin' gives
She'll always need it for as long as she lives
She's a little girl at home
But when I get her all alone
She's full grown (she's all grown)
She's full grown (she's all grown)

And she loves me, she tells me so
She loves me, won't let me go
She loves me, it's easy to see
My love only goes for me
My love only goes for me

She loves me, she tells me so
She loves me, won't let me go
She loves me (she loves me so)
(She loves me, she loves me so)
