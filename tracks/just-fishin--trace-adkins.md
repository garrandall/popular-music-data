Iâm lost in her there holdinâ that pink rod and reel
Sheâs doinâ almost everything but sittinâ still
Talkinâ âbout her ballet shoes and training wheels
And her kittens
And she thinks weâre just fishinâ

I say, âDaddy loves you, babyâ one more time
She says, âI know. I think I got a bite.â
And all this laughinâ, cryin, smilinâ dyinâ here insideâs
What I call, livinâ

And she thinks weâre just fishinâ on the riverside
Throwinâ back what we could fry
Drowninâ worms and killinâ time
Nothinâ too ambitious
She ainât even thinkinâ âbout
Whatâs really goinâ on right now
But I guarantee this memoryâs a bigâin
And she thinks weâre just fishinâ

Sheâs already pretty, like her mama is
Gonna drive the boys all crazy
Give her daddy fits
And I better do this every chance I get
âCause time is tickinâ
(Yeah it is)

And she thinks weâre just fishinâ on the riverside
Throwinâ back what we could fry
Drowninâ worms and killinâ time
Nothinâ too ambitious
She ainât even thinkinâ âbout
Whatâs really goinâ on right now
But I guarantee this memoryâs a bigâin
And she thinks weâre just fishinâ

She ainât even thinkinâ âbout
Whatâs really goinâ on right now
But I guarantee this memoryâs a bigâin
And she thinks weâre just fishinâ
Yeah, aww, she thinks weâre just fishinâ
We ainât only fishinâ
(This ainât about fishinâ)
