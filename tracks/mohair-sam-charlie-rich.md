Well - who is the hippie that's happenin' all over our town?
Tearin' up chicks with the message that he lays down
Who is the coolest guy, what is, what am?
That's fast-talkin' - slow walkin' - good-lookin' Mohair Sam

Chicks are makinreservations for his lovin' so fine (so fine)
Screamin' and shoutin' he's got 'em all waitin' in line
Who is the coolest guy, what is, what am?
That's fast-talkin' - slow walkin' - good-lookin' Mohair Sam

Who is the hippie that's happenin' all over our town?
