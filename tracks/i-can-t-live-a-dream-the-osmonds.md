The day that you moved away
Life was so empty
All I had left
Was your memory

Memory, memory

Livin', it seems
What was left
Was a dream
A dream of the way
It used to be

But I can't live a dream
Anymore than I can live forever
Anymore than I can climb a mountain
To the sun
To the sun...
To the sun...

No I can't live a dream
Anymore than I can move a mountain
Anymore than I can live my life
Without you
Can't live, no...
No I can't live...

No, no
No, no...

All of the things I done
Leaving me lonely
All of the nights
Of missing you only
Only!
Lonely!

I spend my time
With your face
On my mind
Just closing my eyes
Dreaming of you

But I can't live a dream
Anymore than I can live forever
Anymore than I can climb a mountain
To the sun
To the sun...
To the sun...

I can't live a dream
Anymore than I can live forever
Anymore than I can climb a mountain
To the sun
To the sun...
To the sun...

No I can't live a dream
Anymore than I can move a mountain
Anymore than I can live my life
Without you
Without you...
Without you...

No I can't live a dream
Anymore than I can live forever
