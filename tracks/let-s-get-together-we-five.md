Love is but the song we sing
For fear the way we die
You can make the mountains ring
Or make the angels cry
Though the dove is on the wing
And you need not know why

Come on people let's smile on your brother
Hey, let's get together and love one another
Now, come on people and love one another
Hey, let's get together and love one another
Now, come on people and love one another right now

If you hear the song I sing
Then you must understand
You hold the key to love and fear
All in your trembling hand
Yeah, yeah, yeah
One key unlocks them both you know
And it's at your command

(Come on)
Come on people let's smile on your brother
Hey, let's get together and love one another
Now, come on people and love one another
Hey, let's get together and love one another
Now, come on people and love one another
Hey, let's get together and love one another
Now, come on people and love one another
Hey, let's get together and love one another
Now, come on people and love one another right now
