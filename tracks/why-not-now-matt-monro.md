Please love me tonight
For it's clear, very clear
The moment is right
So why not now?

I thrill at your touch
You're so near, very near
I need you so much
So why not now?

Your warm fingertips
Touching my hand
I long for your lips
To understand

And whisper "Love me tonight"
Midnight's near, very near
Tomorrow can wait
So why not now?

Love will never wait
And maybe tomorrow's too late
Say it tenderly

And whisper "Love me tonight"
Midnight's near, very near
Tomorrow can wait
So why not now?

Tomorrow can wait
So why not now?
