Hey, boy you never had much game
Thought I needed to upgrade
So I went and walked away way way
Now, I see you've been hanging out
With that other girl in town
Looking like a pair of clowns clowns clowns

Remember all the things that you and I did first?
And now you're doing them with her
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
You got me, got me like this
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
And everywhere we went, come on!
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
You got me, got me like this hey

Boy you can say anything you want
I don't give a shh, no one else can have ya
I want you back
I want you back
Want-want you, want you back
I broke it off thinking you'd be cryin'
Now I feel like shh looking at you flyin'
I want you back
I want you back
Want-want you, want you back

Please, this ain't even jealousy
She ain't got a thing on me
Tryin' to rock them ugly jeans jeans jeans
You clearly didn't think this through
If what Iâve been told is true
You'll be crawling back like boo hoo hoo

Remember all the things that you and I did first?
And now you're doing them with her
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
You got me, got me like this oh
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
And everywhere we went, come on!
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
You got me, got me like this oh

Boy you can say anything you want
I don't give a shh, no one else can have ya
I want you back
I want you back
Want-want you, want you back oh
I broke it off thinking you'd be cryin'
Now I feel like shh looking at you flyin'
I want you back
I want you back
Want-want you, want you back

Ohhh, I thought you'd still be mine
When I kissed you goodbye uh oh uh oh
Ohhh, you might be with her
But I still had you first uh oh uh oh

Remember all the things that you and I did first?
And now you're doing them with her
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
You got me, got me like this! oh

Boy you can say anything you want
I don't give a shh, no one else can have ya
I want you back
I want you back
Want-want you, want you back
I broke it off thinking you'd be cryin'
Now I feel like shh looking at you flyin'
I want you back
I want you back
Want-want you, want you back

Ohhh, I thought you'd still be mine
When I kissed you goodbye uh oh uh oh
Ohhh, you might be with her
But I still had you first uh oh uh oh

Ohhh
