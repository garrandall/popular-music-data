Uh!
Mmm, yeah
La la la la la (haha)
Uh!


Hey, boy, you never had much game
Thought I needed to upgrade
So I went and walked away, way, way (Uh!)
Now, I see you've been hanging out
With that other girl in town
Looking like a pair of clowns, clowns, clowns (Uh!)


Remember all the things that you and I did first?
And now you're doing them with her
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
You got me, got me like this (Uh!)
And now you're taking her to every restaurant?
And everywhere we went, come on!
And now you're taking her to every restaurant?
You got me, got me like this (Uh!)


Boy, you can say anything you wanna
I don't give a, shh, no one else can have you
I want you back, I want you back
Want, want you, want you back (Uh!)
I broke it off thinking you'd be crying
Now I feel like, shh, looking at you flying
I want you back, I want you back
Want, want you, want you back (Uh!)


Please, this ain't even jealousy
She ain't got a thing on me
Tryna rock them ugly, jeans, jeans, jeans (Uh!)
You clearly didn't think this through (Yeah, yeah)
If what I've been told is true (Is it true?)
You'll be crawling back like, boo-hoo-hoo (Uh!)


Remember all the things that you and I did first? (What?!)
And now you're doing them with her
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
You got me, got me like this (Uh!)
And now you're taking her to every restaurant? (Yeah, yeah)
And everywhere we went, come on!
And now you're taking her to every restaurant?
You got me, got me like this (Uh!)


Boy, you can say anything you wanna
I don't give a, shh, no one else can have you
I want you back, I want you back
Want, want you, want you back (Uh!)
I broke it off thinking you'd be crying
Now I feel like, shh, looking at you flying
I want you back, I want you back
Want, want you, want you back (Uh!)


OhohoohI thought you'd still be mine
When I kissed you goodbye, uh-oh, uh-oh
Ohohoohand you might be with her
But I still had you first, uh-oh, uh-oh


Yeah, yeah, yo


Remember all the things that you and I did first?
And now you're doing them with her
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
You got me, got me like this! (Oh!)


Boy, you can say anything you wanna
I don't give a, shh, no one else can have you (No one else can have you)
I want you back, I want you back
Want, want you, want you back (Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah)
I broke it off thinking you'd be crying
Now I feel like, shh, looking at you flying
I want you back, I want you back
Want, want you, want you back (Uh!) (I want you back)


Ohohoohla la la la la
I want you back, I want you back
Want, want you, want you back (Yeah, yeah, uh!)
Ohohoohuh
I want you back, I want you back
Want, want you, want you back (Uh!)
Does that sound like a helicopter? Brrr
