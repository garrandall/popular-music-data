Mmm, mmm
Yeah


I can read your mind and I know your story
I see what you're going through, yeah
It's an uphill climb, and I'm feeling sorry
But I know it will come to you, yeah


Don't surrender, 'cause you can win
In this thing called love


When you want it the most, there's no easy way out
When you're ready to go and your heart's left in doubt
Don't give up on your faith
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is


When you question me for a simple answer
I don't know what to say, no
But it's plain to see, if you stick together
You're gonna find a way, yeah


So don't surrender, 'cause you can win
In this thing called love


When you want it the most, there's no easy way out
When you're ready to go and your heart's left in doubt
Don't give up on your faith (Don't give up on your faith)
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is (That's the way it is)


When life is empty with no tomorrow
And loneliness starts to call (Loneliness starts)
Baby, don't worry, forget your sorrow
'Cause love's gonna conquer it all, all


When you want it the most, there's no easy way out
When you're ready to go and your heart's left in doubt
Don't give up on your faith (Don't give up on your faith)
Love comes to those who believe it (And that's the way it is)
When you want it the most, there's no easy way out
When you're ready to go and your heart's left in doubt
Don't give up on your faith (Don't give up your faith)
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is


That's the way it is (That's the way it is)
That's the way it is, babe
That's the way it is
Don't give up on your faith (Don't give up on your faith)
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is
