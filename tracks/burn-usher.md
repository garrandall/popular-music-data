Girl, I understand why
See, it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that, I... love you, I just...
I feel like this is coming to an end
And its better for me to let it go now
Than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn


It's gonna burn for me to say this, but it's coming from my heart
It's been a long time coming, but we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out, but I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't, think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting, baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn


When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumping like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn


Sending pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here, but I want you
'Cause the feeling ain't the same
Find myself calling her your name
Ladies, tell me do you understand?
Now, all my fellas, do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake, now it's too late
I know she ain't coming back
What I gotta do now to get my shorty back?
Oh oh oh oh
Man, I don't know what I'm gonna do without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, umpteen hours
I'ma be burning 'til you return (let it burn)


When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumping like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (let it burn, let it burn, you gon' learn)
Let it burn (gotta let it burn), gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn


I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is telling me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, oh
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is telling me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh (can you hear me burning?)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
So many days, so many hours
I'm still burning 'til you return (let it burn)


When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumping like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (let it burn, let it burn), let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn (let it burn, let it burn, let it burn)
Let it burn, gotta let it burn
