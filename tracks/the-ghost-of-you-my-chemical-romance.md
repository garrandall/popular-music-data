If I died, we'd be together
I can't always just forget her
But she could try


At the end of the world or the last thing I see
You are never coming home, never coming home

And all the smiles that are ever gonna haunt me
Never coming home, never coming home
Could I? Should I?
And all the wounds that are ever gonna scar me
For all the ghosts that are never gonna catch me


If I fall, if I fall down...
Woah, woah, woah, woah!
Woah, woah, woah, woah!


At the end of the world or the last thing I see
You are never coming home, never coming home
Never coming home, never coming home
And all the things that you never ever told me
And all the smiles that are ever going to haunt me
Never coming home never coming home
Could I? Should I?
And all the wounds that are ever gonna scar me
For all the ghosts that are never gonna...
