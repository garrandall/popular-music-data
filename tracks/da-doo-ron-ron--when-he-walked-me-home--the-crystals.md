I met him on a Monday and my heart stood still
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
Somebody told me that his name was Bill
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron

Yes, my heart stood still
Yes, his name was Bill
And when he walked me home
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron

I knew what he was doin' when he caught my eye
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
He looked so quiet, but my oh my
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron

Yes, he caught my eye
Yes, my oh my
And when he walked me home
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron

Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron

Picked me up at seven and he looked so fine
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
Someday soon, I'm gonna make him mine
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron

Yes, he looked so fine
Yes, I'll make him mine
And when he walked me home
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron

Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
Da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron
...
