Well it's Friday evening, six o'clock
And all my friends are twisting off
I'm at the house just turning on TV
And they all wonder why I've changed
How many times must I explain
It's basic honky-tonk anatomy

The drinkin' bone's connected to the party bone
The party bone's connected to the staying out all night long
And she won't think it's funny and I'll wind up all alone
And the lonely bone's connected to the drinkin' bone

Hey two plus two is always four
And down is south and up is north
Thirty-two degrees is freezing cold
You play with fire, you wind up burned
The early bird gets the worm
But the only thing you really need to know

Is the drinkin' bone's connected to the party bone
The party bone's connected to the staying out all night long
And she won't think it's funny and I'll wind up all alone
And the lonely bone's connected to the drinkin' bone

Yeah now sing it with me
Let's make sure you know

The drinkin' bone's connected to the party bone
The party bone's connected to the staying out all night long
And she won't think it's funny and I'll wind up all alone 
And the lonely bone's connected to the...
Drinkin' bone's connected to the party bone
The party bone's connected to the staying out all night long
And she won't think it's funny and I'll wind up all alone 
And the lonely bone's connected to the drinkin' bone
