Cherish, cherish

So tired of broken hearts and losing at this game 
Before I start this dance 
I take a chance in telling you 
I want more than just romance 
You are my destiny 
I can't let go 
Baby can't you see 
Cupid, please take your aim at me 

Cherish the thought 
Of always having you here by my side 
(Oh baby I) cherish the joy 
You keep bringing it into my life 
(I'm always singing it) 
Cherish the strength 
You got the power to make me feel good 
(And baby I) perish the thought 
Of ever leaving 
I never would 

I was never satisfied with casual encounters 
I can't hide my need for two hearts that bleed 
With burning love 
That's the way it's got to be 
Romeo and Juliet they never felt this way I bet 
So don't underestimate my point of view 

Cherish the thought 
Of always having you here by my side 
(Oh baby I) cherish the joy 
You keep bringing it into my life 
(I'm always singing it) 
Cherish the strength 
You got the power to make me feel good 
(And baby I) perish the thought 
Of ever leaving 
I never would 

Who? You! 
Can't get away, I won't let you 
Who? You! 
I could never forget to 
Cherish is the word I use to remind me of 
Your love 

(You're givin' it 
You're givin' it to me boy 
Keep giving me all-all-all your joy 
Give me faith 
I will always cherish you) 

Romeo and Juliet they never felt this way I bet 
So don't underestimate my point of view 

Who? You! 
Can't get away, I won't let you 
Who? You! 
I could never forget to 
Cherish is the word I use to remind me of 
Your love 

Cherish the thought 
Of always having you here by my side 
(Oh baby I) cherish the joy 
You keep bringing it into my life 
(I'm always singing it) 
Cherish your strength 
You got the power to make me feel good 
(And baby I) perish the thought 
Of ever leaving 
I never would 

Cherish 
Give me faith 
Give me joy, my boy 
I will always cherish you 
Give me faith 
Give me joy, my boy 
I will always cherish you 

Cherish your strength 
(You're givin' it, you're givin' it to me boy) 
(Can't get away, I won't let you) 
(Keep giving me all your joy) 
Perish the thought 
(You're givin' it, you're givin' it to me boy) 
(I could never forget to) 
(Keep giving me all your joy) 

Cherish the thought 
(Give me faith, give me joy, my boy I will always cherish you) 
(Can't get away, can't get away) 
Cherish the joy 
(Give me faith, give me joy, my boy I will always cherish you) 
(Can't get away, can't get away) 
Cherish your strength 
(You're givin' it to me boy, 
keep giving me all your joy) 
(Can't get away, can't get away) 
Perish the thought 
(You're givin' it to me boy, 
keep giving me all your joy) 
(Can't get away, can't get away) 

Cherish the thought 
(Give me faith, give me joy, my boy I will always cherish you) 
(Can't get away, can't get away) 
Cherish the joy 
(Give me faith, give me joy, my boy I will always cherish you) 
(Can't get away, can't get away)
