Don't be troubled 'bout me 'cause I'm tired
From workin' 'round the house
When day is done
Don't think you failed me cause you can't afford
That dishwasher to make my life more fun
You know, the measure of a man is
Much more than just the money he can make
And every woman knows a lot of joy and tears
Come with the wedding cake

The wedding cake is not all icing
And love and tender whispers in the dark
One slice is concern for all your dreams prayed
They won't come true and break your heart
Another slice is feedin' kids and wipin' noses
Cryin' when the doorbell rings and there are roses
Every woman knows a lot of give and take
Comes with the wedding cake

It's facin' shadows of the future
Prayin' they will fall away as we walk toward them
Searchin' for the sun
And it's long and anxious hours with the wolf at the door
Hugs and kisses when, at last, we see the dawn
So when the hands of time trace tellin' lines upon our face
And lace our hair with strands of gray
We laugh and say for all who will partake
It all comes with the wedding cake

Yes, for all who will partake
It all comes with the wedding cake
Yes, for all who will partake
It all comes with the wedding cake
