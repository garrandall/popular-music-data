(Mac Rebennack/Alvin Robinson)

I want to give you more
More and more
More and more
More than just a melody
To let you know that I love you

I want to give you more
More and more
More and more
More than just a song to sing
To let you know that it's the real thing

I want to make us be
You and me
In close harmony
I want to make us be
You and me
In close harmony

Serenades and symphonies
Lullabyes and sweet melodies
We'll make romantic rhapsodies
Music, maestro, if you please

I want to give you more
More and more
More and more
More than just a love affair
Cause, darlin', you can find that anywhere

Lay your head upon my breast
Fondle me with your tenderness
We've got the key to happiness
Close your eyes and I'll do the rest

I want to give you more
More and more
More and more
More than even life itself
I wouldn't settle for nothing else
