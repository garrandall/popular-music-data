We touch I feel a rush
We clutch
It isn't much but its enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust its torturous,
You must be a sorceress 'cause you just did the impossible
Gained my trust don't play games it'll be dangerous, if you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt I'ma show you what it's like to hurt
'Cause I've been treated like dirt before you and love is "evol"
Spell it backwards I'll show ya

Nobody knows me I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no ones fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these mofuckin' hos
Bloodsucking succubuses, what the fuck is up with this,
I've tried in this department but
I ain't had no luck with this,
It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be like tryin' to start over
I gotta hole in my heart for some kind of emotional rollercoaster
Something I won't go until you toy with my emotion so it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, I wasn't jokin' when I told ya
You take my breathe away
Your a supernova, and I'm a

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Right at you
