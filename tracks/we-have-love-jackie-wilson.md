We have love
Wonderful love
Beautiful love
We have love
Lovely sky to cover all of this
Nothing but the earth
To call our place
We have nothing that money brings
But much more wonderful thing
We have love
Wonderful love
Beautiful love
We have love
We will conquer our travails
No problems will be too great
As long as we have each other
We'll have happiness
We'll have faith
We can't afford a honeymoon
We may not eat from a silver spoon
We have nothing to give us lift
But nature's most precious gift
We have love
Wonderful love
Beautiful love
We have love
