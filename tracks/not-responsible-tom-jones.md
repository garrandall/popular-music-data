Now let me ask you something:
Have you ever felt that you weren't responsible for the things that you do?
When the girl that you are with is just too much
She is so out of sight, baby, that all you can say is:
Well, all right!

I'm not responsible, not responsible
For anything I do when I'm with you
I'm not responsible, it's impossible
To be so very near and not feel part of you
You've got such a hold on me
You make it seem so easy, but it's true, oh yeah
I get such a happy feeling
Knowing that you feel the same way too

Whoa...oa, baby, all right

I'm not responsible, not responsible
When you can make a man do what you want him to
I'm not responsible, it's impossible
To be so very near and not know what to do
You got such a hold on me
You make it seem so easy but it's true, oh yeah
I get such a happy feeling
Knowing that you feel the same way too
I get such a happy feeling
Knowing that you feel the same way too
Believe me baby, ....
