Ramona, I hear the mission bells above
Ramona, they ringing out a song of love

I press you caress you
And bless the day you taught me to care
To always remember
The ramblin rose you wear in your hair

Ramona, when day is done you hear my call
Ramona, we'll meet beside the waterfall

I'll dread the dawn
When I awake to find you gone
Ramona
I need you, my own

Ramona, I hear the mission bells above
Ramona, they ringing out a song of love

I press you caress you
And bless the day you taught me to care
To always remember
The ramblin rose you wear in your hair

Ramona, when day is done you hear my call
Ramona, we'll meet beside the waterfall

I'll dread the dawn
When I awake to find you gone
Ramona
I need you, my own
