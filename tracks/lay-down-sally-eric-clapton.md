There is nothing that is wrong
In wanting you to stay here with me
I know you've got somewhere to go
But won't you make yourself at home and stay with me?
And don't you ever leave


Lay down, Sally, and rest here in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you


Sun ain't nearly on the rise
We still got the moon and stars above
Underneath the velvet skies love is all that matters
Won't you stay with me?
Don't you ever leave


Lay down, Sally, and rest here in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you


I long to see the morning light
Coloring your face so dreamily
So don't you go and say goodbye
You can lay your worries down and stay with me
Don't you ever leave


Lay down, Sally, and rest here in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, there's no need to leave so soon
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you

Lay down, Sally, and rest here in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, there's no need to leave so soon
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you
