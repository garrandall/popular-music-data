Linus Dotson helped me make a Christmas EP
The Great Luke Ski is a good friend to me
Props to John Hall, peace to King Missile
Mark Hoppus is my homie props to Throbbing Gristle

They've got game theory, that's how Jersey Boys ball
Damondrick Jack and my boy Nick Jenkins
Kristy Jett, BER, remain unshaken

"Weird Al" Yankovic, can't forget you
I'm down with Matt Yazzie and I know Yung Joc
I'm friends with Fred Zyda, but it's over, I gotta stop

YTCracker I know him too
That's implied from the cover of this CD


Hey this is Rico, the Rondo Brothers's intern
I'm loving this album, it's been mad fun
And I'm from Tahoe


Peace it's over, no more, Doc Pop, sing the chorus
it's funny, here it goes, 1, 2, 3!
