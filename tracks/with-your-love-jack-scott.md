With your love here beside me
Here to guide me, how can I go wrong?
Doo, doo, doo, doo, he sent you on to me
'Cause you were meant for me
I know you'll always be my real destiny
The touch of your soft hands
The kiss from your sweet lips
Will meet my fingertips
With your love
I know there'll never be
Another love for me
Happiness eternally
With your love
With your love beside me
Here to guide me, how can I go wrong
With your love, with your love, with your love
