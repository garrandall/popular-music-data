I saw this old man with this young girl the other night.
I walked over to him and pulled him off on the side,
And I said, "Pops, what are you trying to prove?"
I said, "I've seen you out here every night this week
With a different young girl wrapped around your arm."
I said, "You can't keep this pace up, uh,
"Because these young girls,
Huh, oh! -- they'll certainly get you down."

He said, "Son, sit down here.
Lemme tell ya something."
He said, "All my life I've worked hard. Huh,
And I've saved up me a little money."
He said, "But just about the time I got me a nest egg saved,
I became a widow man."
He says, "And I'm 72 going on 73 years old
And don't have too many more years to live."
Hah, he said, "I know that I should be ashamed of myself.
Ha. "But --" he said,
"Young girls is my weakness.
Oh yes, they are." Huh.
He said, "So would you plea-ea-ease
Leave this old gray-haired man alone.
"Mind your business. Heh-heh. Let me and this young girl
Have us a little bit of fun." Ehuh.

That's when I looked at him and I said,
I said, "All right, Pops, you got her.
"But listen, ha ha ha ha, here's all you're doing --
"Oh yes! Oh yes! Oh, you just --
"Buying -- buyin' a book."
(Buying -- buying a book.)
That's what I said to him,
I said, "Listen to this, here's all you're doing."
(Buying a book for some young man --)
"That's what you're doing, heh,
-- to read.
"But don't do it.
(Don't do it.)
"Don't do it!
(Don't do it!)
"Oh, don't do it!
(Don't do it!)
"Send that young girl on home."
Mmmm-mmmm-mmm.

Then there was this middle-aged woman whose name I dare not call --
Simply because you out there listening
Just might know who this woman is.
But I can tell you this much:
The woman lives right here in your town.
I know you didn't know that, did you? Huh.
I saw this woman with this young man,
In the broaden day time the other day.
I say, "Miss Lady, you oughta be ashamed of yourself,
Ridin' around with this young man all hugged up like this here." Heh huh.

She said, "Son, oh Son, you're dippin' in my business.
"But if you want to know why I fool with this young man,
I'll tell you."
She said, "I was married to a man 40 years older than I was."
Says, "For a long time I was true and faithful to that one man."
Says, "And last year he died and willed me a whole lotta money.
"And I know that that young man sittin' in my car
Just wants me for my money. Uh-huh."
She said, "But if that's what it takes to keep the young, fine thing
-- oh ho! -- he can get every single dime.
"Because it ain't nothin' an old man can do for me,
But show me which way a young man went." Hah hah!

Oh Lord! Oh! Oh!
Here's what I said, huh
I said, "You're just --
Buying --
(Buying--)
That's all you're doin' --
(-- buying a book.)
That's what I told her, huh
"Listen, Miss Lady, here's all you're doin' -- uh!
(Buying a book for some young girl --)
"You oughta quit it, huh --
-- to read."
(Don't do it.)
I said, "That's your car, drive him home,
(Don't do it.)
Give him all your money!
"I'm sorry I dipped in your business.
"I won't do it no more.
"Nooooo."
