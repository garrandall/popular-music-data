Come down selector

This one goes out to you and yours, worldwide

I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you

I've been a lot of places all around the way
I've seen a lot of joy and I've seen a lot of pain
But I don't wanna write a love song for the world
I just wanna write a song about a boy and a girl

Junkies on the corner always calling my name
OK
And the kids on the corner playing ghetto games
When I saw you getting down, well, I hope it was you
And when I look into your eyes I knew it was true

I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you

Now I'm not a highly metaphysical man
But I know when the stars are aligned you can
OK
Bump into a person in the middle of the road
Look into their eyes and you suddenly know

Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
Rocking rocking
Dancing in the night in the middle of June
My momma told me don't lose you
'Cause the best luck I had was you
Sure

I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
Alright
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you

And I say, rocking in the dance hall, moving with you
I say, hey momma, hey momma, close to you
Rocking in the dance hall, moving with you
I say, hey poppa, hey poppa, take off your shoes

Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
I say, hey momma, hey momma, close to you
Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
I say, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma

What are gonna do, papa

My momma told me don't lose you
'Cause the best luck I had was you
And I know one thing
That I love you

I say hey, I'll be gone today
OK
But I'll be back all around the way
You promise
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know

I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know

But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
I love you, I love you, I love you
It's true, it's true
I love you, I love you, I love you

Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
I say, hey poppa, hey poppa
Hey momma, hey momma
Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
Come on, hey poppa, hey poppa
