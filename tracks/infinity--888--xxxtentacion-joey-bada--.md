These niggas is wildin' right now, like, these niggas is really wildin'
You know what I'm sayin'? Like, we ain't playin' with y'all niggas, man, you heard?

Sometimes you just gotta catch chlamydia on these niggas, G shit

You know what I'm saying? Gonorrhea, all of that shit

All of that shit

I catch all diseases in the world so the world don't have no more diseases, you feel me?

G shit


I'm as real as they come, they feel it, get numb
They think you got a little buzz so now you can't get stung
I keep a razor blade tucked on me, runnin' my tongue
Don't let me have to tell these niggas about the city I'm from
It's Brooklyn, be the home of hardest ever
Where them niggas don't aim, they just palm Berettas
And bomb whatever
Say we don't move calmly never, this for my niggas trapped in cells like salmonella
Look, I could do this shit with no effort, no pressure, no gimmick shit, no radio records
Just textbook rhyme style with the raw texture
Punchlines, right hooks, now that's a trifecta
No more free lectures, I'm taxing these niggas extra
This the Pro of all Eras, he's back in your sector
So, might be best to protect your neck
Or profess your debt to the god, he might bless ya


Murder these flows like I murder these hoe ass niggas
Where the fuck is your energy bro?
Make your nigga deep throat a Desert Eagle
If he try me like a hoe, pussy boy that's on my soul
Make my flow shape shift, cold expression like a facelift
At the Publix with like eight grips , if you talking all that ape shit
I'm talking YM Bape shit, but I'm banging on my chest bitch
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Travelin' through the infinity, uh
You not that nigga, pretend to be, uh
All that bullshit do not get to me, uh
I am a spirit and entity, uh
You just wanna suck all my energy, uh
I am the realest since Kennedy, uh
These pussy ass niggas fuckin' suck, you sound the same
I spit the pain, that's why the young niggas feel the same
They know I bang, I pull a fuckin' pistol out the Range and act insane


Spend years at the crib so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more, I gotta get it how I live
I don't feel the pain no more, I don't feel the pain no more
I spend years at the crib so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more, I gotta get it how I live
So I don't feel the pain no more, I don't feel the pain no -
I spend years at the crib so I don't feel the pain no more
So I don't feel the pain no more, I gotta get it how I live
I don't feel the pain no more, I don't feel the pain no more
I spend years at the crib so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more, I gotta get it how I live
So I don't feel the pain no more, I don't feel the pain no more
