I want you back again
I want your love again
I know you find it hard to reason with me
But this time it is different, darling you will see


You got to tell me you are coming back to me


You said we are through before
You walked out on me before
I tried to tell you, but you did not want to know
This time you are different and determined to go

I wait as the days go by
I long for the nights to go by
I hear the knock on my door that never comes
I hear the telephone that has not rung
