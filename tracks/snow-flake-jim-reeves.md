Hey-ey-ey  snowflake
My pretty little snowflake
Oh, oh, the change in the weather
Has made it better for me.
Hey-ey-ey snowflake, my pretty little snowflake
You've got me warm as a fire
With the burning desire for you.

Snow was falling when love came calling
On this lonely heart of mine.
You were standing there with snow flaked in your hair.
You kept stalling while my thoughts were calling
On every way I knew
For one excuse to get acquainted with you

Then I said
Snow flake my pretty little snowflake
Oh, oh, the change in the weather
Has made it better for me.
Hey-ey-ey snowflake, my pretty little snowflake
You've got me warm as a fire
With the burning desire for you.

The ice was breaking and
Love was waking in a winter wonderland.
When I felt you slip your fingers in my hand.
Now snow is gleaming and
I'm not dreaming I know this is for real.
The love I have is too much to conceal.

Hey-ey-ey snowflake
My pretty little snowflake
Oh, oh, the change in the weather
has made it better for me.
Hey-ey-ey snowflake, my pretty little snowflake
You've got me warm as a fire
With the burning desire for you...
