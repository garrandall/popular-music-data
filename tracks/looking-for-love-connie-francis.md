You stepped on the overnight train
I looked in your eyes
But just couldn't find the words to ease your pain
And deep down I knew that I'd never see you again
I stood there and waved you good-bye
My heart wasn't sad
I though I'd forget about you by and by
But now that you're gone I sit here alone and I cry

'Coz I gave up a lifetime of love
The moment I let you go
The moment so long ago, my love
When you went away

Now I long for that lifetime of love
That you could've given me
Without you it's hard to see, my love
How I can go on

And now I'm without you I find
It's always the same
The skies are all cloudy and the sun won't shine
When I said goodbye I must have been out of my mind
'Coz I gave up a lifetime of love
The moment I let you go
The moment so long ago, my love
When you went away

Now I long for that lifetime of love
That you could've given me
Without you it's hard to see, my love
How I can go on

Yes, I gave up a lifetime of love
The moment I let you go...
