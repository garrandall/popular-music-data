Achtung! Jetzt wir singen zusammen die Geschichte
Uber dem schweinkomischen Hund und dem lieben Red Baron!

After the turn of the century
In the clear blue skies over Germany
Came a roar and a thunder men had never heard
Like the screamin' sound of a big war bird

Up in the sky, a man in a plane
Baron von Richthofen was his name
Eighty men tried, and eighty men died
Now they're buried together on the countryside

Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty or more
The bloody Red Baron was rollin' up the score
Eighty men died tryin' to end that spree
Of the bloody Red Baron of Germany

In the nick of time, a hero arose
A funny-looking dog with a big black nose
He flew into the sky to seek revenge
But the Baron shot him down -
"Curses, foiled again!"

Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty or more
The bloody Red Baron was rollin' up the score
Eighty men died tryin' to end that spree
Of the bloody Red Baron of Germany

Now, Snoopy had sworn that he'd get that man
So he asked the Great Pumpkin for a new battle plan
He challenged the German to a real dogfight
While the Baron was laughing, he got him in his sight

That bloody Red Baron was in a fix
He'd tried everything, but he'd run out of tricks
Snoopy fired once, and he fired twice
And that bloody Red Baron went spinning out of sight

Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty or more
The bloody Red Baron was rollin' up the score
Eighty men died tryin' to end that spree
Of the bloody Red Baron of Germany

Well, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty or more
The bloody Red Baron was rollin' up the score
Eighty men died tryin' to end that spree
Of the bloody Red Baron of Germany
