Hey, she was walking down the street
Just as fine as she could be, yeah
Hey, hey

Well, she was walking
Down the street, yeah
Just as fine as she could be, yeah
Huh, all right

Well, she got a lovely conversation
Oww, what I say, hey, hey

Well, she's about a mover (a mover)
She's about a mover (a mover)
She's looking good
Just like I knew she would

Hey, baby (she's about a mover)
You're so fine (she's about a mover)
I'd like to make you mine
Hey, hey (hey, hey)

Well, you know I love you, baby
Oww, what I say, hey, hey
(What I say) all right (what I say)

Well, she walked right up to me
Say, hey, big boy, what's your name
Hey, hey (hey, hey)

Well, she walked right up to me
Say, hey, big boy, what's your name
All right (hey, hey)

Well, you know I dig you, baby
Oww, what I say (what I say)
All right (what I say)

Well, she's about a mover
(She's about a mover)
She's about a mover
(She's about a mover)

Sure feeling good, oh, oh
(Hey, hey) oh, baby

(She's about a mover)
You're looking so fine
(She's about a mover)
Just got to make you mine
One day, hey, hey (hey, hey)

Baby, I love you
Oww, what I say (what I say)
Hey, hey (what I say)

Keep on walking now, baby
(She's about a mover)
Keep on walking now
(She's about a mover)

Looking good
Keep on walking, baby
(She's about a mover)

You know you got a thing going on
Looking so fine
Just got to make you mine
(She's about a mover) hey, hey....
