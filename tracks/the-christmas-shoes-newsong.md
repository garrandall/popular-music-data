It was almost Christmas time
And there I stood in another line
Trying to buy that last gift or two
Not really in the Christmas mood
And standing right in front of me was a
Little boy waiting anxiously
Pacing around like little boys do
And in his hands he held
A pair of shoes

His clothes were worn and old
He was dirty from head to toe
And when it came his time to pay
I couldn't believe what I heard him say


Sir I wanna buy these shoes
For my mama. please
It's Christmas eve and these shoes are just her size
Could you hurry sir
Daddy says there's not much time
You see,
She's been sick for quite a while And I
know these shoes will make her smile And I
Want her to look beautiful
If mama meets Jesus tonight

They counted penny's for what seemed like years then the
Cashier said, "Son, there's not enough here."
He searched his pockets frantically
Then he turned and he looked at me and he said
"Mama made Christmas good at our house though
Most years she just did without, Tell me sir,
What am I gonna do?
Some how I gotta buy her these Christmas shoes."

So I laid the money down
I just had to help him out
And I'll never forget the look on his face when he said,
"Mama's gonna look so great."



I knew I'd caught a glimpse of heaven's love as he thanked me and ran out
I knew that God had sent me that little boy to remind me what Christmas is all about

I want her to look beautiful if mama meets Jesus tonight
