I got your letter
I felt so scared to
Pick up the paper knife and read within
I read the contents
I got what you meant
I know its hard for you but don't give in
Maybe, maybe slow things go fast
Maybe, maybe its all in the past

Chorus:
Oh oh if you need me don't let go - oh
(You know I'll never give up on you)
Oh oh if you need me don't let go - oh
(You know I won't give up on you)
Oo oo - oo oo oo - oo
You know I'll never give up on you

I phoned the station
For information
To try and get the times of trains to York
And on the platform
I saw your hatform
A kind of halo in the crowd - crush talk

But baby baby don't run away
Maybe, maybe it's just today

Repeat Chorus

I saw your sad face
You dropped your suitcase
And I appreciate the state you're in
You mustn't hurry
You mustn't worry
I know it's hard on you but don't give in

Maybe, maybe slow things go fast
Maybe, maybe its all in the past

Repeat Chorus
