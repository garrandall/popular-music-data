Brother, brother
Sister, sister

It's the loneliness that's the killer

So you want
To be free
To live your life
The way you wanna be
Will you give
If we cry?
Will we live
Or will we die?
Oh

Jaded hearts (hearts)
Heal with time
Shoot that love (oh, whoah, whoah, whoah)
So we can
Stop the bleeding, oh

Solitary brother (brother)
Is there still a part of you that wants to live?
Solitary sister (sister)
Is there still a part of you that wants to give?
Solitary brother (brother)
Is there still a part of you that wants to live?
Solitary sister (sister)
Is there still a part of you that wants to give?

If we try
And live our lives
The way we wanna be
Yeah

Oh, love, love
Oh, love, love

Brother, brother
Sister, sister
Brother, brother, brother, brother, brother

There's no other love (there's no other love)
There is no other love, no other love like ours
There's no other love (there's no other love)
There is no other love, no other love like ours
There's no other love (there's no other love)
There's no other love (there's no other love)
There is no love

Solitary brother (brother)
Is there still a part of you that wants to live?
Solitary sister (sister)
Is there still a part of you that wants to give?

Solitary brother, brother, brother, brother, brother, brother, brother
Solitary Sister (sister)
Is there still a part of you that wants to give?

Racism in among future kings can only lead to no good
Besides, all our sons and daughters already know how that feels
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Love, love, love
