This whole world is in a sad condition
This whole world is in a sad condition
This whole world is in a sad condition
But I keep on battling on


Uh, aye, aye, good morning
The Garden where our innocence died, we're still mourning
I rolled up on your cousins like, "listen shorty you're more than
Dope boy, jump off Bentley, you are important"
But he ain't tryna listen, man he keep on cookin' rocks
'Cause he tired of seeing his brother with them holes off in his socks
Momma bring these men home, his father they are not
But they touch him one more time, might just wind up getting shot
Aye, full of rage and pain, I see it in your eyes
God is their hope in all, I'm looking at the sky
Thinking if we ball, it'll change how we feel inside
But the Gospel can only change how we feel inside
Christ died for us, ultimate price for us
Didn't stay in the ground, got up and rise for us
So even if this world is broken, can't never break us
My faith isn't in it, my heart is something greater

This whole world is in a sad condition
This whole world is in a sad condition
This whole world is in a sad condition
But I keep on battling on


I got a problem with myself, I think I need help
Ain't tellin' me I'm rich, I think I need wealth
I think I need the belt, baby I'm the champ
Is you seein' these jewels? Maybe that's the stamp
They call it Grade A, skipped over school, never made a grade "A"
But I'm staring at this tool that they call a AK
Don't that count for something?
Money on the scale, no I can't count for nothing
No key for my chariot, I just push a button
They call it futuristic, but I call it stuntin'
I'm just living my life
Looking out for my throne on this incredible night
One mil in my crown, what an incredible sight
You ain't never seen ten fingers shine this bright
I say hey, it's all cool, but it don't mean a thing
'Cause when you die, it dies, you're an imaginary king

This whole world is in a sad condition
This whole world is in a sad condition
This whole world is in a sad condition
But I keep on battling on


I'm from the hood where they mask up, strap talk to get cash up
Crack flippin' that trap bruh, act tough and get clapped up
Yeah, where bodies rot, yeah you can smell death
They say the block is hot, I say that's hell's breath
Dreads all in they hair, kush smoke in that air
Window into his soul, you can see the pain in his stare
Uh, since he's a young'un his momma has been the geeker
On the streets where, where you could just die for a pair of sneakers
They like, "look you can be whatever, " "lil homie sky's the limit"
Make it about the hood, but he just see peeps dying in it
All around's him destruction, that's the norm for his family
Tore down his projects, now all that he's known is abandoned
Sadly he's been conditioned that this has to be livin'
Tell him do better, you'll have to supply a definition
What's even sadder, internally he is broke
Nobody that'll show that in Jesus should be his hope
And that's sad...

This whole world is in a sad condition
This whole world is in a sad condition
This whole world is in a sad condition
But I keep on battling on


Blinded by the world, we stumble 'cause it's all dark
Never thought that I would be tempted to fall hard
Simple man, yeah, and life is real as ever
I study him to learn exactly how he did it better
Perfect, not a flaw, not a mistake
I used to shine bright, now I'm just praying I don't break
Erosion over time, my cleats turn to skates
The stress from my slides, you can see it in my face
Grace is all I'm leaning on these days
I crossed the road and sinners comin' from each way
Save me, oh wretched man I am
Without these nails in your feet, I don't know how to stand
Without these nails in your hands, I don't know who I am
Help me turn from this lust, get me out of this jam
My soul's at stake, and I could die tonight
Chartered the king and he hit me with that private flight

This whole world is in a sad condition
This whole world is in a sad condition
This whole world is in a sad condition
But I keep on battling on


Stuck in the sphere of what's near, sad conditions keep me here
Tried outer space, I'm out of place, and I can't breathe up in that atmosphere
Every minute that I'm in it, feel the pressure thicken
Take my diesel from this scene and this pump injured me from breathing 
So I say where I'm from, outside the box don't feel like home
I wish it did 'cause where I live will be this way till I'm gone
Conscious students acting foolish, learning to be unruly
See these pupils taking light, folks die for what they refusin'
Yeah, movie did a massive thing, same-sex marriages
Preacher choked their children out and then they wanna pastor us
Plus I did dirt, yeah, hard intent to hurt all
Friends to me, enemies, millionaire, slum dog
Hustle man, no Martin man, just tryna find a come-up quick
Sad condition, heart is sick, sadly man I'm loving it
Need to get up out this world, packing for a rocket ship
God ain't sent a rocket, but he sent his Son, I'm outta here
