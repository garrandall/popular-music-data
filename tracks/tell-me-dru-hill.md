Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
Tell me if it ain't good enough for you, baby
Tell me
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need (Tell me, babe)
Tell me if it ain't good enough for you, baby
(Listen, baby)
Tell me


Anything is possible
Anytime you want it girl let me know
Won't Ask why, just let it flow
(Do your thang, baby) Take control
On my knees, just say the word
No request is gonna go unheard
I'll take my time when I'm lovin' you
Foreplay at one, won't end 'til two


Tell me what you want (Tell me, baby)
Tell me what you need (Tell me, baby)
Tell me if it ain't good enough for you baby
(Oh, tell me, baby - let me know)
Tell me
Tell me what you want (Tell me, baby)
Tell me what you need (Mmm, talk to me)
Tell me if it ain't good enough for you, baby
(Oh, tell me, baby)
Tell me (Sisqo)


Candelights, we're alone
I'm up in your mix if you put me on
Talk to me, I'll understand
Your need to feel a gentle hand
Now girl it's not my style, I cannot lie
You know I like to serve it on the freaky side
(Is that what you like?)
What you want, I can't ignore
So tell me what you're looking for, yeah


Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
Tell me if it ain't good enough for you, baby
(Won't you tell me)
Tell me
Tell me what you want
(Maybe it's the clothes you wear)
Tell me what you need
(Versace, I don't know)
Tell me if it ain't good enough for you, baby
(And you know, you know, when I lay you down)
Tell me


When I lay you down I can hear your body speak (Yeah)
Tellin' me to kiss you 'til your knees get weak
All night (All night, in the bedroom, baby)
Workin' that, workin' that, workin' that body, baby
In the bed or the middle of the floor, baby
My love is guaranteed to make you go crazy
Tell me, girl (Said I don't see nothin' wrong)
Girl, please tell me (With loving you all night long)


Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
Tell me if it ain't good enough for you, baby
Tell me
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
Tell me if it ain't good enough for you, baby
Tell me
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
Tell if it ain't good enough for you, baby
Tell me
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
Tell if it ain't good enough for you, baby
Tell me
