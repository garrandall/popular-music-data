At a bar down in Dallas
An old man chimed in
And I thought he
Was out of his head

Just being a young man
I just laughed it off
When I heard what
That old man had said

He said, I'll never again
Turn the young ladies heads
Or go running off into the wind

I'm three quarters home
From the start to the end
And I wish I was eighteen again

I wish I was eighteen again
And going where I've never been
But old folks and old oaks
Standing tall just pretend
I wish I was eighteen again

Now time turns the pages
And, oh, life goes so fast
The years turn the
Black hair all grey

I talked to some young folks
Hey, they don't understand
The words this old man's got to say

I wish I was eighteen again
And going where I've never been
But old folks and old oaks
Standing tall just pretend
I wish I was eighteen again

Lord, I wish I was eighteen again
