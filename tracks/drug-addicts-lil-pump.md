Whole gang full of drug addicts (Oh, chyeah)
Take a lot of shit, forgot what happened (Forgot what happened)
I ain't gon' lie, I got a habit (Oh, I got a habit)
Swear to God, you can't be on my status, ho (I swear to God)
Start the day off with a pint (Yeah, brrt-brrt)

Told my pastor I don't do confessions (Hell nah)
'Cause I pop a lot of molly for my breakfast (Oh, molly)
I ain't never listen to nobody (Nope)
In the courthouse off of ecstasy (Goddamn)
And your baby mama layin' next to me (Huh?)
After she just sucked me, I just told her ass to leave (Bitch get out, oh
Everybody 'round me like them Oxy's (Yeah, brrt)
I was too leaned out to drive the 'Rari (Huh?)
Made her ass wait two hours in the lobby (Thot)
I can't go outside, 'cause I see paparazzi (Chyeah, brrt)
Take another pill, now I'm feelin' better (Oh, X)
Gucci Gang, Gucci Gang, yeah I'm a trend-setter (Gucci Gang)
Bustin' all on your bitch, wiped it off with my sweater (Oh)
I'm a drug addict, I'm richer than my professor (Man, fuck school)

Whole gang full of drug addicts (Oh, chyeah)
Take a lot of shit, forgot what happened (Forgot what happened)
I ain't gon' lie, I got a habit (Oh, I got a habit)
I swear to God, you can't be on my status, ho (I swear to God)
Start the day off with a pint (Yeah, brrt-brrt)
I'ma show you how to live life (Yeah, oh
Take a lot of drugs, don't think twice (Wow)
