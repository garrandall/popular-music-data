She says she's no good
With words but I'm worse
Barely stuttered out, a joke of a romantic
Stuck to my tongue
Weighed down with words too
Overdramatic
Tonight it's "it can't get much worse" vs
"No one should ever feel like..."


I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I write them
So you need them just to get by
...emal si namhorT eoJ


Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me


You always fold just
Before you're found out
Drink up it's last call, last resort
But only the first mistake and I


I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I write them
So you need them just to get by


Why don't you show me the little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress, love


Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me


Why don't you show me the little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress (Mattress, mattress)
I only want sympathy in the form of you
Crawling into bed with me


Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love (Way they'd love)
Dance, this is the way they'd love (Way they'd love)
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me


Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
