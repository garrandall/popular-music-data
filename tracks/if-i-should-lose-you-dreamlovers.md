If I should lose you
My friends will laugh and say
We told you so

They keep on asking me
Why don't you let her go
They said she'll soon
Break my heart

If I should lose your love
Each time I cry, they say
We told you say

Friends keep on asking me
Why don't you let her go
Friends say we'll soon
Have to part

You go your way, I'll go mine
Letting everybody know
But I'll forget your love in time
Funny but that's the way life goes

If I should lose you
My friends will laugh and say
We told you so

They keep on asking me
Why don't you let her go
They said she'll soon
Break my heart

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Break my heart
