When push comes to a shoving
I'd rather make some lovin'
And without being sneaky
Or sounding to you freaky
I get high
I get high
What ya say
I get high on you
Naturally my temperature is rising
I hope you're realizing
To know you is my pleasure
And you're my only treasure
I get high on you
I get high on you
I get high on you
Sing it
Even when I'm sleeping
Your body seems to creep in
And slowly you awake me
Wow Mother Nature takes me
I get high on you
I get high on you
You know what I've been doing
I get high on you
I get high on you
I get high on you
I get high on you
Naturally I get high yes on you
I get high on you
