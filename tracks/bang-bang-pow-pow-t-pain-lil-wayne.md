My money right, my money money, my bread good (good, good)
Shawty fuckinâ, wassup girl? that head good!
Bang bang pow pow
I do my thang thang
Look at me now now

My money right, my money money cash up
Up up and away, face down, ass up
I rep my town town, thatâs where Iâm from
So nigga pow pow, bom bom

Money to blow, Iâm living off tour
Boatload of cash, bitch Iâm overboard
I got money for these whores if you open up the door
The company accounts and they all wanna record?
Real talk, I donât speak, even if itâs âhi haterâ
Iâm on top and nothing like the elevator
All these bitches say I'm fly and I can never touch the ground
Iâm not tryna be in your circle cause I donât fuck around

I get that money, that money (money)
I live it, I want it, Drop the top on that Ferrari
Now Iâm in California
I let the hard top down and the wind blow through
All I do is win, what the fuck you gon do
Good, good, good
I do this for my hood, hood, hood
Yeah, and ain't nobody gonna stop me I doing it right now
So bang bang pow pow and everybody say




I go so hard they call me go so hard
You ain't a king, you a joker card
Fuckinâ up the Church money like an alter boy
I got the yellow xanex, call em tonka toys
I go bonkers boy, I put that on my mom and âem
The hoes are all alike, they put the hoe in
I think all these niggas sound like me, Thatâs a compliment
I told a midget bitch, I do it big hippopotamus
Put that on my Slime and âem
No B-ball; we stop and pop
No b-ball we got shit locked
Swagger ill, wassup doc
Make that pussy pop like the gun I went to jail for
Shoot the doors off that jeep, that bitch look like a mail trunk
Ya pussy keep ya tail tucked, real niggas in this bitch
Get that pussy wet, fuck her than I jet: Kenny Smith
T-pain voice, all I do is win and shit
Young money in here ya muthafukinâ face
