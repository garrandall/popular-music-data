All these kinds of places
Make it seem like it's been ages
And tomorrow some new building will scrape the sky
I love this country dearly
I can feel the ladder clearly
But I never thought I'd be alone to try

Once I was outside Penn Station
Selling red and white carnations
We were still alone
My wife and I
Before we marry, save my money
Brought my dear wife over
Now I want to bring my family stateside

But off the boat they stayed awhile
Then scattered across the coast
Once a year I'll see them for a week or so at most

I take a walk

Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
I take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk

Practice isn't perfect
But the market cuts a loss
I remind myself that times could be much worse
My wife won't ask me questions
There's not so much to ask
And she'll never flaunt around an empty purse

Once my mother-in-law came
Just to stay a couple nights
Then decided she would stay the rest of her life
I watch my little children, play some board game in the kitchen
And I sit and pray they never feel my strife

But then my partner called to say the pension funds were gone
He made some bad investments, now the accounts are overdrawn

I take a walk

Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
I take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk

Honey it's your son I think I borrowed just too much
We had taxes, we had bills, we had a lifestyle to front
And tonight I swear I'll come home and we'll make love like we're young
Tomorrow you'll cook dinner for the neighbours and their kids
We can rip apart those socialists and all their damn taxes
But see I am no criminal
I'm down on both bad knees
I'm just too much a coward to admit when I'm in need

I take a walk

Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
I take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
I take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
I take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
