Put your hand in the hand
Of the man who stilled the water

Put your hand in the hand
Of the man who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself and
A you can look at others differently

By puttin' your hand in the hand
Of the man from-a Galilee

Every time I look into the Holy Book
I want to tremble
When I read about the part
Where a carpenter cleared the temple
For the buyers and the sellers were
No different fellas than what I profess to be

And it causes me shame to know
I'm not the gal that I should be

Put your hand in the hand

Mama taught me how to pray before
I reached the age of seven

And when I'm down on my knees that's a
When I'm close to heaven
Daddy lived his life with two kids and a wife
You do must you must do
But he showed me
Enough of what it takes to get you through
