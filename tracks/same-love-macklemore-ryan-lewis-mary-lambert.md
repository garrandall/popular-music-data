When I was in the third grade I thought that I was gay
Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like "Will you've loved girls since before pre-k, trippin'"
Yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
Bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like "Yeah, I'm good at little league"
A preconceived idea of what it all meant
For those that liked the same sex (Ooh)
Had the characteristics
The right wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made rewiring of a predisposition
Playing God, (Yeah yeah) aw nah here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know (Ooh)
And "God loves all his children" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written (Ooh) thirty-five-hundred years ago
I don't know


And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to

And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to

My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm


If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me (Hoo)
Have you read the YouTube comments lately? (Hoo)
"Man, that's gay" gets dropped on the daily
We become so numb to what we're saying (Oh oh)
A culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board (Hoo)
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
Gay is synonymous with the lesser (Ooh)
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment (Yeah)
The same fight that led people to walk outs and sit ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference!


And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
Hey
My love, my love, my love

She keeps me warm (Love is patient)
She keeps me warm (Love is kind)
She keeps me warm (Love is patient)
She keeps me warm (Love is kind)
She keeps me warm (Love is patient)
Not crying on Sundays (Love is kind)
Love is patient (Love is patient)
Oh (Love is patient)


Love is kind
