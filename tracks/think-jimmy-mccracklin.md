I want to know, I want to know, I just got to know
Why do you always play around
If you, if you have the same feeling for me
Then why don't you settle down

I want to know
I want to know, I just got to know

I think you want me for conveniency
If I'm wrong please tell me right
I know, I know I been in the dark for a long time
But some day I'll see the light

And I want to know
I want to know, I just got to know

It takes you to prove you love me
You can prove it sure as the world is round
But from, but from your ways and actions
I have a feeling you have let me down

I want to know
I want to know, I just got to know

It takes you to prove you love me
You can prove it sure as the world is round
But from, but from your ways and actions
I have a feeling you have let me down

I want to know
I want to know, I just got to know

And I want to know
I want to know, I just got to know
