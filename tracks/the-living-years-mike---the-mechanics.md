Every generation, blames the one before
And all of their frustrations, come beating on your door
I know that Iâm a prisoner to all my father held so dear
I know that Iâm a hostage to all his hopes and fears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years

Crumpled bits of paper
Filled with imperfect thoughts
Stilted conversations, Iâm afraid thatâs all weâve got
You say you just donât see it, he says its perfect sense
You just canât get agreement, in this present tense
We all talk a different language, talking in defense

So say it loud
Say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
Itâs too late (itâs too late)
When we die (when we die)
To admit we donât see eye to eye

So we open up the quarrel
Between the present and the past
We only sacrifice the future
Itâs the bitterness that lasts
So donât yield to the fortunes
You sometimes see as fate
It may have a new perspective on a different day
And if you donât give up, and donât give in, you may just be OK

So say it say it say it loud
Say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
âCos itâs too late (itâs too late)
When we die (when we die)
To admit we donât see eye to eye

I wasnât there that morning
When my father passed away
I didnât get to tell him, all the things I had to say
I think I caught his spirit, later that same year
Iâm sure I heard his echo in my babyâs newborn tears
I just, wish I could have told him in the living years

So say it say it say it loud
Say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
âCos itâs too late (itâs too late)
When we die (when we die)
To admit we donât see eye to eye

Yes itâs too late (itâs too late)
When we die (when we die)
To admit we donât see eye to eye

Every generationâ¦
