Can you surry, can you picnic, whoa?
Can you surry, can you picnic?
Come on, come on and surry down to a stoned soul picnic
Surry down to a stoned soul picnic
There'll be lots of time and wine
Red yellow honey, sassafras and moonshine
Red yellow honey, sassafras and moonshine
Stoned soul, stoned soul, whoa

Come on, come on and surry down to a stoned soul picnic
Surry down to a stoned soul picnic (Can you surry, can you picnic?)
Rain and sun come in again
And from the sky come the Lord and the lightning
And from the sky come the Lord and the lightning
Stoned soul, stoned soul
Surry on, soul

Surry, surry, surry, surry

There'll be trains of blossoms (There'll be trains of blossoms)
There'll be trains of music (There'll be music)
There'll be trains of trust, trains of golden dust
Come along and surry on, sweet trains of thought, surry on down
Can you surry, can you surry, can you surry?

Surry down to a stoned soul picnic
Surry down to a stoned soul picnic (Can you surry, can you picnic?)
There'll be lots of time and wine
Red yellow honey, sassafras and moonshine (Red yellow honey)
Red yellow honey, sassafras and moonshine, moonshine
Stoned soul, yeah
Surry on, soul

Surry, surry, surry, surry
Surry, surry, surry, surry
Surry, surry, surry, surry
