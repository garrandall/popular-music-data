In the shadows, you've got to know your lover mostly by feel
You've got to put your faith in things you can touch
If you dare to

Cos the shadows, can make you crazy with the things they reveal
They show it all without revealing too much
Scare the hell out of you

Cos me and my love, live among the shadows
Where the old playground is an alley way
Now me and my love, make love among the shadows
When the sun goes down, in a dark hallway
Love in the shadows where the crowd never goes
Deep in the shadows where flowers won't grow
Me and my baby know, love in the shadows

In the shadows, you've got to work at love to get it to shine
You can't believe in everything that you see
Not this time around

Cos the shadows, can play a half a million tricks on your mind
You try your best but you can never be free
It just kinda drags you down

Cos me and my love, live among the shadows
Where the old playground is an alley way
Now me and my love, make love among the shadows
When the sun goes down, in a dark hallway
Love in the shadows where the crowd never goes
Deep in the shadows where flowers won't grow
Me and my baby know, love in the shadows
