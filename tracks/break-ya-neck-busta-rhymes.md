I know you love the way we be giving you the music, making you bounce

Now fuck it up just a little for my niggas
Every time we come through niggas know that we did it for y'all (Uh-huh)
And the way we do it for the people

In the day time or the night, when ya creeping along
Well just bang this shit up in the truck
While you break your neck, now motherfucker try to figure my flow

See the way we come right through (When we come right through!)

Better tell your crew, your peeps
All my niggas better put they troops on
And gather up your soldiers nigga
You know you better keep your boots on

All my niggas in the place (Aiyyo!)
Wave your hands high now, and the way we put it down
