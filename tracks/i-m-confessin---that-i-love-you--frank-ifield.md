I'm confessin'.

I'm confessin' that i love you tell me do you love me too
I'm confessin' that i need you honest i do
Need you every moment

In your eyes i read such strange things
Must your lips deny they're true
Will your answer really change things
Leaving me blue

I'm afraid some day you'll leave me
Saying can't we still be friends
If you do you know you'll grieve me
For all in life on you depends

Am i guessing that you really love me
Dreaming dreams of you in vain
I'm confessin' that i love you
Over again.
