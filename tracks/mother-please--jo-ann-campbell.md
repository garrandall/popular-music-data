Mother, please
I'd rather do it myself

Mama, mama, why must it be
(Nag, nag, naggity nag)
You're picking my brain for me
(Nag, nag, naggity nag)

Well, you tell me who
You tell me how
Don't you know
I'm a big girl now
Mother, please
I'd rather do it myself

Mama, mama, when I go out
(Nag, nag, naggity nag)
You lecture me what love's about
(Nag, nag, naggity nag)
Well, I have to learn from you like this
But look at all the fun I've missed

Mother, please
I'd rather do it myself
You know I've got to
Make love and live a little
And what will be, will be
I'm sure you feel
Tense and irritable
But don't take it out on me

Mama, mama, you know the score
(Nag, nag, naggity nag)
You know you been
Through the mill before
(Nag, nag, naggity nag)

Well, you say to stay at home in bed
But did you obey what your mama said
Mother, please
I'd rather do it myself
You know I'm gonna go out
And do it my way
And find out you were right

Keep your bike out of the driveway
I'm coming home late tonight
Mama, mama, you told me this
(Nag, nag, naggity nag)
There's danger in every kiss
(Nag, nag, naggity nag)

Well, you say I'll learn
A heart can break
Well, that's the chance I gotta take
Mother, please
I'd rather do it myself
Mother, please
I'd rather do it myself
(Nag, nag, naggity nag)
