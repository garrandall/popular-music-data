Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm,
I know; it's been coming for some time.

When it's over, so they say
It'll rain a sunny day,
I know; shining down like water.

I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day?

Yesterday, and days before,
Sun is cold and rain is hard,
I know; been that way for all my time.

'Til forever, on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow,
I know; it can't stop, I wonder.

I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day?

Yeah!

I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day?
