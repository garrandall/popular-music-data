With a tender love, you filled my lonely days
You made me need you, darlin', in so many ways
But you no longer come around very much
And lately there's no tenderness in your touch


Where did it go? That warm and tender feeling
Where did it go? The love that I believed in?
You filled my life with so much meaning
It's empty now, now that you're leaving


Just look what you've done; you've turned my dreams to dust
I thought you needed me, but now I find that you're leavin' me
Oh you've turned my heart to stone
Without you by my side, where will I get the strength to carry on?


Now helplessly I stand, watchin' love walk away
There's nothin' I can do, nothin' I can say
For you our love was just a passin' thing
But to me, my darlin', it was everything


Where did it go? The love I always turned to
Where did it go? Where do I go without you?
When I needed you, you were always there
I'm nothing now without your love to share


Just look what you've done; you've turned my dreams to dust
I thought you needed me, but now I find that you're leavin' me
Oh you've turned my heart to stone
Without you by my side, where will I get the strength to carry on?


Where did it go? The love I always turned to
Where did it go? And where do I go without you?
When I needed you, you were always there
I'm nothing now without your love to share


Just look what you've done; you've turned my dreams to dust
I thought you needed me, but now I find that you're leavin' me
Oh you've turned my heart to stone
Without you by my side, where will I get the strength to carry on?
