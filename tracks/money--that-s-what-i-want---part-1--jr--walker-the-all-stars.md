Got a shape and a pretty face
But there ain't nothin'
Can take the place

I want money
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want

I need money
That's what I want

You do the twist, baby
That won't do

You can do the hully gully
But that won't do
Whoa

Get yo' shotgun
But that won't do

Do the twine
That won't do

'Cause I need money
To keep me true
Whoa

I need money
To keep me true

Baby, now what'd I say

Oh, you know what I mean
Woo

I need money
That what I want

'Cause I need money
To keep it true
Hey

Looks like, maybe
Yeah, you are through

'Cause I need money
To be with you

I need money
That's what I want

That's what I said
That's what I want
Woo
