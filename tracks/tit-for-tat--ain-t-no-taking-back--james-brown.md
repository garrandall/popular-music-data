Everybody, have fun
Everybody

Plenty of good food
And all the good joys
Plenty of music
In the kiddie room
There's plenty of toys

Review all the dances
All from the old and the new
With a real, a real live show
For you and you and you

From the baby section
Teenagers, adults at once
All in their own bag without
Without an ounce of grudge

You don't have to stand
When all can share the fun
Without an ounce of grudge, alright now
With your mom, your son and your hon

So keep the band rocking
So, band play on, play on
'Cause soon everybody
Will be in a real mellow ton&101

So keep the band, the crew
And don't and don't get back
'Cause you can have a real lotta fun
When it's tit for tat and no taking back

Play with your hand
Play volleyball
Hide and go seek
(Incomprehensible)
Okay, one more time
Come on genius

All right, everybody line up
Ready, you ready
Watch my hands
Everybody sing, come on

Plenty of good food, alright you
And all the good joys
Plenty of music
In the kiddie room
There's plenty of toys

Review the old dances
All from the old and the new
With the real live show, everybody
For you, you and you
Come on now

From the baby section
Teenagers, adults at once
All in their own bag
Here's what you want
Without an ounce of grudge

Now, together
You don't have to stand
When all can share the fun
Without an ounce of grudge
With mom, your son and your hon
Come on
