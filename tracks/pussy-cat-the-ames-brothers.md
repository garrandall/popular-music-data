Pussy cat, pussy cat
Pussy cat, pussy cat

Well, I was born
In a little old house
In a town called Barrel Bay
I was eight years old
When I fell in love and
And it seems like yesterday

Down the old mill road
In a pretty house lived
Some folks not far from me
And they had a child
Only one year old
And a lovely babe to see


They called her Pussy Cat
Puss, Puss, Pussy Cat
For her hair was soft and fine
Pussycat, Puss, Puss, Pussy Cat
For her two big eyes would shine
She had a smile so sweet
And a great deal more than that
And she'd coo and purr
When I smiled at her with
A milky skin like silky fur
My Puss, Puss, Puss, Puss
Pussy Cat

Well, the years went by
And I grew quite tall
For I shot up like a vine
And I used to watch old Pussy Cat
Till she reached the age of nine

Then I said goodbye
For I left one year,
For a town in Iowa
And I didn't see anyone I knew
'Til I came back one fine day



Well, there she stood
Like a pretty rose and
My goodness, how she'd grown
But the sparkling eyes
And the turned-up nose
Looked the same though
Years had flown

Then I knew at once
She belonged to me
And I knew she felt the same
So our lives were joined
And our first new-born
Was a girl who bore her name



My Puss, Puss, Puss, Puss
Pussy Cat, Pussy Cat.
