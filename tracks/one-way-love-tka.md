One way love
Thought we had something
Girl, I can't get you out of my mind
Just one look
I knew you were on of a kind

Your love is hot
So give me all you've got
I need your love
Too much is not enough

One way love
Thought we had something
Girl, you played me for a fool
Should of held back all my loving
Didn't know there were no rules

One way love
Now I'm still crying
Tears are falling like the rain
But I know I'll keep on trying
Why you put me through this pain?

You said our love had passed the test
But then you left me like all the rest
That night we fought
You knew you had been caught
I knew the plan
You found
You found another man

One way love
Thought we had something
Girl, you played me for a fool
Should of held back all my loving
Didn't know there were no rules

One way love
Now I'm still crying
Tears are falling like the rain
But I know I'll keep on trying
Why you put me through this pain?

Now, it's over
You're out of my life
And I won't make the same mistake twice
You broke my heart
You knew it from the start
You were my world
But I've found
I've found another girl

One way love
Thought we had something
Girl, you played me for a fool
Should've held back all my loving
Didn't know there were no rules

One way love
Now I'm still crying
Tears are falling like the rain
But I know I'll keep on trying
Why you put me through this pain?

One way love
Thought we had something
Girl, you played me for a fool
Should of held back all my loving
Didn't know there were no rules

One way love
Now I'm still crying
Tears are falling like the rain
But I know I'll keep on trying
Why you put me through this pain?

One way love
Thought we had something
Girl, you played me for a fool
Should of held back all my loving
Didn't know there were no rules

One way love
Now I'm still crying
Tears are falling like the rain
But I know I'll keep on trying
Why you put me through this pain?

One way love
Thought we had something
Girl, you played me for a fool
Should of held back all my loving
Didn't know there were no rules

One way love
Now I'm still crying
Tears are falling like the rain
But I know I'll keep on trying
