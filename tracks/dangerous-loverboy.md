You're doing it every night, you play with my emotions
Before we go on fighting let's get one thing straight
Is it going to be him or me--You know I need an answer
And now down to the wire and I just won't wait

There's something going on, I want to hear it from you face-to-face
Ya--you know it won't be long, before you make your last mistake
Cause you're dangerous, you've got it coming to you
Dangerous--Now what am I going to do?
Dangerous--And I'm a lot like you

We got to talk it out, there's three sides to every story
Well--ya, there's your side, there's my side and then there's the truth
I want to hear it from you, ya say we're all the same
But I know you ain't no angel,
Cause who you gonna blame when you wake up
Beside a stranger
Dangerous--You got it coming to you
Dangerous--Now what am I going to do, Baby
Dangerous--And I'm a lot like you
I'm a lot like you

There's something going on, I want to hear it from you face-to-face
Ya--you know it won't be long, before you make your last mistake
Cause you're dangerous, you've got it coming to you
Dangerous--Now what am I going to do?
Dangerous--And I'm a lot like you
