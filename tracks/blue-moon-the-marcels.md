Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Oh, blue moon
You knew just why I were there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for

And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will hold
I heard somebody whisper, "please adore me"
And when I looked to the moon, it turned to gold

Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Oh-oh, blue moon
You knew just why I were there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for

And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will hold
I heard somebody whisper, "please adore me"
And when I looked to the moon, it turned to gold

Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
