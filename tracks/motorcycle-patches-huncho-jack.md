Motorcycle patches on my jacket
Rip all the money out the plastic
Put it on her tongue and now she dancin'
Gave her everything, now whatchu' asking
Flip, make it flip, do gymnastics
Popped up a bean like a talent
Eat up all the green, taste just like salad
40 on my hip like it's new fashion, blastin'


Huncho, yeah, yeah, yeah
She gon' make that ass dribble, playin' basket (ball)
Don't call it cuffin', nigga, I ain't passin' (woo)
Niggas pourin' fours, poppin' seals like caskets (drippin')
Nawfside hot boy, I bought a dragon (yeah)
I get it, you grill, VIP, spread the bills (spread)
M's the deal, spinnin' the fortune wheel (spin it)
4 by 4, skrrting all the wheels (skrrt)
Eskimo (brr), icy necks and grills, watch out, watch out
Big Baller Brand, watch out (watch out)
This for the fam, watch out (watch out)
It's my time, don't clock out (time)
Three way pack, we knock out (knock out)
Molly make her bite down (bite down)
42 Pistons, Stackhouse (boss)
Nigga we winnin', racks out (cash racks)


Motorcycle patches on my jacket (yah)
Rip all the money out the plastic (it's lit)
Put it on her tongue and now she dancin' (pop it, pop it)
Gave her everything, now whatchu' asking (alright)
Flip, make it flip, do gymnastics
Popped up a bean like a talent
Eat up all the green, taste just like salad (yah)
40 on my hip like it's new fashion, blastin' (yah, yah)

Fuck shit up, we fuck shit up
We got, we stuck, drugs got me stuck
Diamonds untucked, diamonds untucked
(Ice, ice, yeah)
We gon' rope
I can't stop no more on my time, I can go, yeah (oh, no)
If I send these flicks to your phone, you can't leave (nah)
Motorcycle patches is earned on the streets (ahh, ahh)
Fuck shit up, we done fucked shit up
It got me stuck, it done got me stuck
Drugs got me stuck, drugs got me stuck
Diamonds are tucked, diamonds are tucked, (ahh) yeah
Jacket got stripes (alright)
I been blessed in with the knights (blessed)
Just turned 25, yeah (five)
Goin' in like I'm doin' 25 to life (ahh)
I'm alone, out of sight
At they crib, come take a hike
And it feel not the Hills
I been beatin' like it's Ike (straight up)
No more grills, they like wheels, make me ill at the sight
Even still scroll through the reals
Missed a time zone, we here
Don't even age, yeah she know (yeah)
You was tried, never hope (yeah, yeah)
You was real, Jack and Jill
Like the pill had awoke, uh (it's lit), yeah

Motorcycle patches on my jacket (yah)
Rip all the money out the plastic (yah, yah)
Put it on her tongue and now she dancin' (pop it, pop it)
Gave her everything, now whatchu' asking (don't)
Flip, make it flip, do gymnastics (ahh)
Popped up a bean like a talent (yah, yah)
Eat up all the green, taste just like salad (it's lit!)
40 on my hip like it's new fashion, blastin' (pew, pew, pew, pew, pew)
