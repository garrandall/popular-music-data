Yo, I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want.
So, tell me what you want, what you really really want.
I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want.
So, tell me what you want, what you really really want.
I wannaâ, I wannaâ, I wannaâ, I wannaâ, I wanna really, really, really wanna zigazig, ah.

If you want my future forget my past.
If you wanna get with me better make it fast.
Now don't go wasting my precious time.
Get your act together, we could be just fine.

I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want.
So, tell me what you want, what you really really want.
I wannaâ, I wannaâ, I wannaâ, I wannaâ, I wanna really, really, really wanna zigazig, ah.

If you wanna be my lover
You gotta get with my friends
(gotta get with my friends).
Make it last forever,
Friendship never ends.
If you wanna be my lover
You have got to give.
Taking is too easy, but that's the way it is.

What do you think about that? Now you know how I feel.
Say you can handle my love. Are you for real
(are you for real)?
I won't be hasty, I'll give you a try.
If you really bug me then I'll say goodbye.

Yo, I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want.
So, tell me what you want, what you really really want.
I wannaâ, I wannaâ, I wannaâ, I wannaâ, I wanna really, really, really wanna zigazig, ah.

If you wanna be my lover
You gotta get with my friends
(gotta get with my friends).
Make it last forever,
Friendship never ends.
If you wanna be my lover
You have got to give.
(You got to give.)
Taking is too easy, but that's the way it is.

So here's a story from A to Z.
You wanna get with me?
You gotta listen carefully.
We got Em in the place
Who likes it in your face.
She got G like MC
Who likes it on anâEasy V
Doesn't come for free.
She's a real lady.
And as for me?
Ha-ha! You'll see.

Slam your body down and wind it all around.
Slam your body down and wind it all around.

If you wanna be my lover
You gotta get with my friends
(gotta get with my friends).
Make it last forever,
Friendship never ends.
If you wanna be my lover
You have got to give.
(You got to give.)
Taking is too easy, but that's the way it is.

If you wanna be my lover
You gottaâ, you gottaâ, you gottaâ, you gottaâ,
You gotta slam, slam, slam, slam.
Make it last forever.

Slam your body down and wind it all around.
Slam your body down and wind it all around.

Slam your body down and wind it all around.
Slam your body down and zigazig, ah.

If you wanna be my lover.
