:
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Doctor's orders say there's only one thing for Me
Nothing He can do, 'cause only You can cure Me
It says in My condition love's the best physician
He's prescribed a potion full of warm emotion

Every day
A loving spoonful to be taken
It's the only way
To stop this empty heart of Mine from breaking

I won't get better until You're back again
He told Me, doctor's orders need Your loving arms to hold Me
Darling, now I know there is no doubt about it
I'm so fond of Your love, I can't live without it

You're away
But, please don't treat Me like a stranger
Doctor's orders say,
One kiss from You and I am out of danger

:
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
Ooh, ooh, hey, hey, hey, hey)

Doctor's orders say there's only one thing for Me
Nothing He can do, 'cause only You can cure Me
It says in My condition God's My best physician
He's prescribed a potion full of warm emotion

I won't get better until You're back again

(Fade)
