We've been goin' steady now for such a long time
And up until now, everything was just fine
You say you still love me but it's not the same
It so plain to see that you're playin' a game

You really know how to hurt a guy
You really know how to make me cry
You really know how to hurt a guy
But what a mean way to say goodbye

Every time you hurt me, it seems like you planned it (it seems like you planned it)
I've talked to your friends but they don't understand it (they don't understand it)
Where did we lose it? What did I do wrong?
We can't break it up now, it's lasted so long

You really know how to hurt a guy
You really know how to make me cry
You really know how to hurt a guy
But what a mean way to say goodbye

If you'd look at me, you'd see tears in my eyes
When we're together and you're lookin' at other guys (at other guys)
The ones that you like are really not your kind
I know their type and what's on their minds

You really know how to hurt a guy
You really know how to make me cry
You really know how to hurt a guy
But what a mean way to say goodbye

You really know how to hurt a guy
You really know how to make me cry
You really know how to hurt a guy
But what a mean way to say goodbye

You really know how to hurt a guy
You really know how to make me cry
You really know how to hurt a guy
But what a mean way to say goodbye
