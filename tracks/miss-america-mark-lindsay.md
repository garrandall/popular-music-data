As a young girl she ran wild
Freely gave herself to men who understood
She lay naked in the sun
Giving birth to what was clear and strong and good

Oh lord to you her life
Wants to know a joy that drove her soul insane
And she'd lead you down a path
Through a river love was etched in summer rain

Do you miss America
Miss America
Miss America
I know I do

She was offered jewels and feathers
And she wore the clothes of souls who once she loved
She was driven to the site
Of a marble grave for a dying dove

Rage exploded cross her face
And makeup melted on the cemetery lawn
And she cried for the rest
And she wrapped her fingers round the deep blue stone

Do you miss America
Miss America
Miss America
I know I do

I've seen her in the forest
And she sings the peaceful songs for you and me
And I've heard her in the hills
And I'm glad to say she's still alive and free

Oh lord her loving eyes
Cast in ripples 'neath the sun without a sound
And she never spreaded sky
As her children dance along the rain washed ground

Do you miss America
Miss America
Miss America
I know I do

Do you miss America
Miss America
Miss America
I know I do

Do you miss America
Miss America
Miss America
I know I do
