Marching along
To my Red River Rose
Waiting for me where
The Red River flows
Soon when the big
Yellow moon softly glows
I'll be embracing
My Red River Rose

As I marched down the trail
With my face to the west
My thoughts fly away
To the girl I love best

But there where the mountains
Reach up to the blue
My love promised me
She'd be faithful and true



The bugles were sounding
When we kissed goodbye
She smiled but I knew
She was ready to cry

Take care, dear, she whispered
Although you must go
Be brave and remember
That I love you so

She gave me a locket
That I'll always wear
Inside was a curl
From her bright golden hair

And when I was lonely
For comfort and cheer
I'd open that locket
And know she was near
