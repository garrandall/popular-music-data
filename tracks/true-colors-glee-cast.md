You with the sad eyes
Don't be discouraged
Oh I realize
It's hard to take courage

In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
And darkness still inside you
Make you feel so small

But I see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful like a rainbow

Show me a smile then
Don't be unhappy
Can't remember when
I last saw you laughing

If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know I'll be there

And I'll see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful like a rainbow

Can't remember when I last saw you laughing

If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know I'll be there

And I'll see your true colors shining through
I see 'em shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
That's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors

See your true colors shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors
True colors are beautiful like a rainbow
