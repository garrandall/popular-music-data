You say you're looking for someone
And you're burning up inside
I know I'm the only one
Who can keep you satisfied

We can't afford to wait
Tomorrow is too late
All night, all right
Sometimes love just feels so wild
Walking the straight line
All night, all right
Don't you know that we can make it
Right the first time

They say it's gone too far
And we're growing up too fast
But they don't know
Who we are
So let's make this moment last

We can't afford to wait
Tomorrow is too late
All night, all right
Sometimes love just feels so wild
Walking the straight line
All night, all right
Don't you know that we can make it
Right the first time

All night, all right
Sometimes love just feels so wild
Walking the straight line
All night, all right
Don't you know that we can make it
Right the first time
Right the first time
Right the first time
Right the first time
All right
Yeah it's going to be all right
