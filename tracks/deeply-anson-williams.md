You ask is my love real
All i can say is how i feel
Deeply
Deeply as can be
You seem to need to know
How i would hurt if you would go
Deeply
(Deeply)
Down inside of me
Is our love forever, can anyone ever know?
For all i remember i never have felt love so
So deeply
Deeply
(Deeply)
Our love is made by two and i can't make it without you
Deeply
Feel so deeply
For our love

Is our love forever? can anyone ever know?
For all i remember i never have felt love so
So deeply
Deeply
Deeply
Deeply
(Deeply)
For our love
