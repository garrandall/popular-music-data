("Yooouuu better watch your step!")
("Yooouuu better watch your step!")


Hey yo
It's all love, but love's got a thin line and Pun's got a
Big nine, respect crime but not when it reflect mine
The shit I'm on is wrong but it lasts long
Pull a fast one on Pun and wake up with your stash gone
I'm mad strong, and my cream is fast, smoke the
Greenest grass, my bitch got the meanest ass
And a taste legit, I don't have to waste a whole case of Crist'
All it takes is my pretty face and my gangsta wit
Lace the clique, 'cause we all share, it's all fair
Like love and war, thug galore with the long hair
Big Pun, Pun the name that makes the kids run
Like spelling murder reverse it deliver redrum
Come one, come all, if you wanna brawl I'm the mighty
Thor clotheslining motherfuckers like Steven Seagal
'Cause all you're gonna get, is your ass kicked or up in a casket
That's it (That's it?) That's it


Punisher
Bash it, at last it's rappers that really blast shit
Cats getting Big Willie niggas like Billy Bathgate
Up in Jimmy's Cafe, having caviar
Crackin Cristal at the bar, smokin' cigars, livin' large
We rob and steal, run with the mob, doin' jobs for bills
I'm hard to kill for real, nigga, guard your grill
I like to chill, spark an L and get high
I'm one hell of a guy, fly pelican fly


Whattup Duke-o, you know, politickin' papi chuco
I'm out here, watching for Jake, getting this loot though
Shoot bro, I got a waterproof suit yo
Swervin' like a A.K.A. in Beirut yo
Squeezin', out of automatic M3's and
Please, you ain't seen no thugs like these
I can tell you lots of things that'll make you believe
In Corona, yo, it's better to take than to receive


Your career's on life support, and I'mma pull the plug
And have every thug shootin' that Beatnut drug
In they blood, no escapin' this, niggas is
Goin' over their favorite shit (for what?) to be tapin' this
World premiere, loud and clear
Lah and beer, get the dough, blow up the show
Disappear, jump in the Cavalier
Feelin marvelous, street pharmacist, twist arboles
For pleasure, bring your territory terror
Keep my workers under pressure got em sayin' "FUCK LESTER"
But that's aight Duke-o, my heart nowadays too cold
Don't give a fuck where you been, what you done
Where you go, you know, peep this statement
In black shades like a secret agent
We're night thieves, roll up on you like sleeves
We light trees, bust these and stack cheese


It's off the
Hook this year (cheddar), makin' mad money off the
Books this year. ("Yooouuu better watch your step!") Ain't nothin' but
Crooks in here, gettin' mad money off the
Books this year. It's off the
Hook this year (cheddar), gettin' mad money off the
Books this year. ("Yooouuu better watch your step!") Ain't nothin' but
Crooks in here, gettin' mad money off the
Books this year


Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go

Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go ("Yooouuu better watch your step!")
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go ("Yooouuu better watch your step!")

Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go

Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go ("Yooouuu better watch your step!")
Go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go ("Yooouuu better watch your step!")
