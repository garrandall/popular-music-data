I live on the West side, she lives on the East side of the stree-ee-eet 
And though they say that East is East and West is West 
And never the twain shall meet 
Each morning I face her window and pray that our love can be 
'Cause that brownstone house where my baby lives 
Is Mecca (Mecca, Mecca, Mecca) Mecca (Mecca, Mecca) to me-e-e-e-e-e. 

Oh she's my dream goddess and her ruby lips are so div-i-ine 
And though her folks say we're too young to know of love 
I worship at her shrine 
Each morning I face her window and pray that our love can be 
'Cause that brownstone house where my baby lives 
Is Mecca (Mecca, Mecca, Mecca) Mecca (Mecca, Mecca) to me-e-e-e-e-e. 

Each morning I face her window and pray that our love can be 
'Cause that brownstone house where my baby lives 
Is Mecca (Mecca, Mecca, Mecca) Mecca (Mecca, Mecca) to me-e-e-e-e-e.
