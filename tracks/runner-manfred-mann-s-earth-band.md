Through the night, through the dawn
Behind you another runner is born
Don't look back
You've been there
See the mist as your breath hits the air

And it's underneath the moonlight, passing some
Still your heart beats in the moonlight, like a drum

Through the night, through the dawn
Behind you another runner is born
Don't look back
You've been there
Feel the mist as your breath hits the air

And it's underneath the moonlight, passing some
Still your heart beats in the moonlight, like a drum

And you will run your time
A shooting star across the sky
And you will surely cross the line
To pass on the flame

Sun come up, sun go down
Hear the feet, see the sweat on the ground

Watch your step
Keep your cool
Though you can't see what's in front of you

And it's underneath the moonlight, passing some
Still your heart beats in the moonlight, like a drum

And you will run your time
A shooting star across the sky
And you will surely cross the line
Just to pass on the flame
Pass on the flame

Through the night, through the dawn
Behind you, another runner is born
Don't look back
You've been there
See the mist as your breath hits the air

And it's underneath the
Moonlight passing some
Still your heart beats in the moonlight like a drum

And you will run your time
A shooting star across the sky
And you will surely cross the line

(And you will run your time)
And it's underneath the moonlight, passing some
(A shooting star across the sky)
Still your heart beats in the moonlight, like a drum
(And you will surely cross the line)

And you will run your time
(To pass on the flame)
A shooting star across the sky
(To pass on the flame)
And you will surely cross the line

(And you will run your time)
And it's underneath the moonlight, passing some
(A shooting star across the sky)
Still your heart beats in the moonlight, like a drum
(And you will surely cross the line)

And you will run your time
A shooting star across the sky
And you will surely cross the line
