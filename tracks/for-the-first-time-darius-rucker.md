You say you never danced to a dashboard singin' R.E.M. under summer stars
Never leaned back on a jet black Chevy, blowing smoke rings in the dark
You don't want to be a rumor, girl, and I feel just the same
Yeah, I know that you don't know me well but we can make that change

When was the last time you did something for the first time?
Yeah, let yourself go, follow that feeling
Maybe something new is what you're needing
Like a real life, let your hair down, feel alive
When was the last time you did something for the first time?

Say you never drank from the bottle of some two dollar wine, run barefoot through the mud
Never had the right kiss stolen from your lips, while you watched the sun come up
Well, I know your friends are watching and they probably disapprove
But give me just half a chance, girl, I'm daring you

When was the last time you did something for the first time?
Yeah, let yourself go, follow that feeling
Maybe something new is what you're needing
Like a real life, let your hair down, feel alive
When was the last time you did something for the first time?

Now the way you're looking says you're living
I hope I ain't reading wrong
Cause the way you're shining I think you're thinking
It's been way too long

When was the last time you did something for the first time?
Yeah yeah, let yourself go, come on follow that feeling
Maybe something new is what you're needing
Like a real life, let your hair down, feel alive, alive
When was the last time oh you did something for the first time, girl?
Come on, baby
When was the last time yeah you did something for the first time?
