(Never, never, never)
No, will I let you go
(Never, never, never)
Because I love you so
And you know, yes, you know
You're the girl in my heart

(Never, never, never)
Please give your love to me
(Never, never, never)
Mmmm, I'm on my bended knees
And I know, yes, I know
You're the girl in my heart

I've told you my true story
And why I had to cry
You know, names have been changed
To protect you and I-I-I-I
I love you darling
I love you so
And I never let you go

(Never, never, never)
Please give your love to me
(Never, never, never)
Mmmm, I'm on my bended knees
And I know, yes, I know
You're the girl in my heart

(Never, never, never)
(Never, never, never)
