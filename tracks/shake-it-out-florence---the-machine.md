Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play
And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

And I've been a fool and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way
I'm always dragging that horse around
All of his questions, such a mournful sound
Tonight I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground
Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
But it's always darkest before the dawn

Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa

And I am done with my graceless heart
So tonight I'm gonna cut it out and then restart
Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa (shake him off)

And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
(Shake him off)
And given half the chance, would I take any of it back
(Shake him off)
It's a fine romance but it's left me so undone
(Shake him off)
It's always darkest before the dawn
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa

And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my rope
And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope
It's a shot in the dark aimed right at my throat
'Cause looking for heaven, found the devil in me (whoa)
Looking for heaven, found the devil in me (whoa)
Well, what the hell, I'm gonna let it happen to me
Yeah

Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

(What the hell)
(What the hell)
What the hell
What the hell
What the hell
