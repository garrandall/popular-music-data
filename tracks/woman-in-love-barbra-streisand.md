Life is a moment in space
When the dream is gone, it's a lonelier place
I kissed the morning goodbye
But down inside you know we never know why
The road is narrow and long
When eyes meet eyes and the feeling is strong
I turn away from the wall
I stumble and fall but I give you it all


I am a woman in love and I do anything
To get you into my world and hold you within
It's a right, I defend
Over and over again
What do I do


With you eternally mine
In love there is no measure of time
We planned it all at the start
That you and I live in each other's heart
We may be oceans away
You feel my love, I hear what you say
No truth is ever a lie
I stumble and fall but I give you it all


I am a woman in love and I do anything
To get you into my world and hold you within
It's a right, I defend
Over and over again
What do I do


Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I am a woman in love and I'm talking to you
You know I know how you feel, what a woman can do
It's a right, I defend
Over and over again


I am a woman in love and I do anything
To get you into my world and hold you within
It's a right, I defend
Over and over again
