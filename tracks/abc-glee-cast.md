 A buh-buh buh buh-buh
 A buh-buh buh buh-buh


You went to school to learn, girl
Things you never, never knew before


I got I before E except after C


And why two plus two makes four
Now, now, now I'm gonna teach you ( Teach you, teach you)
All about love, dear, ( All about love)


Sit yourself down, take a seat
All you gotta do is repeat after me


A B C, easy as one, two, three
Are simple as do re mi
A B C, one, two, three, baby, you and me girl
A B C, easy as one, two, three ( Ohhhh)
Are simple as do re mi
A B C, one, two, three, baby, you and me girl


( Come on, let me love you just a little bit)
Come on, let me love you just a little bit
( Teach, teach, sing it out) Come on, come one, come on
Let me show you what it's all about


Reading and writing arithmetic
Are the branches of the learning tree


But listen without the roots of love let me tell you, girl


Your education ain't complete


T-t-t-teacher's gonna show you, ( show you, show you)
How to get an A, ( Nah nah nah nah naah)


Spell me, you, add the two
Listen to me baby, that's all you gotta do


A B C is easy as one, two, three
Are simple as do re mi
A B C, one, two, three, baby, you and me girl
A B C is easy as like counting up to three ( Ohhhh)
Sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be
That's how easy love can be
Sing a simple melody ( That's how easy love can be)
One, two, three, you and me


Sit down girl I think I love you


No, get up girl show me what you can do!


Shake it, shake it, baby, ( come on now)
Shake it, shake it, baby, ( oh-oh)
Shake it, shake it, baby,
One, two, three baby oo
A B C baby
do re mi baby
That's how easy love can be
A B C is easy as like counting up to three ( Ohhhh)
Sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be


Now I'm gonna teach you how to sing it out,
Come on, come on, come on, let me show you what it's all about
A B C it's easy it's like counting up to three ( Ohhhh)
Sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be


Now I'm gonna teach you how to
Sing it out, sing it out, sing it out, sing it out


A B C is easy it's like counting up to three
Sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be


Now I'm gonna teach you how to
Sing it out, sing it out, easy as one, two, three
