I had some problems
And no one could seem to solve them
But you found the answer
You told me to take this chance

And learn the ways of love, my baby
And all that it has to offer
In time you will see
That love won't let you down

You said that you loved me
Said hurt only came to pass me
It sounded so convincing
That I gave it half a chance

And learned the ways of love, my baby
There is so much love inside me
And all that I have
I give my all to you

All, all my love, baby
And all this love is waiting for you
My baby, my darling
And all, all my love is waiting for you

Oh, I had some problems
And no one could seem to solve them
But you, you, you found the answer
So I gave it half a chance

And learned the ways of love, my baby
And all that it had to offer
And all that I have
I give my all to you

All, all my love, babe
And all this love is waiting for you
My baby, my sugar
And all, all my love
Is waiting for you, oooh

All this love is waiting for you
And all this love is waiting for you
My, baby, and baby, all this
All this love is waiting for you
My sugar, my baby
And all my love is waiting for you

Oh, I love how you make me feel this way
My love is getting stronger every day. my baby
And after all I went and put myself through
I found that all I really needed was you
My darling

As the sun has it's place up in the sky
I love you so dearly and all the same
There's no need to wonder why
I need you, please hear me

Say you really love me, baby
Say you really love me, darling
For I really love you, baby
You know I really love you, darling

And, baby, all
All this love is waiting for you

Say you really love me, baby
Say you really love me, darling
For I really love you, baby
Sure enough love you, darling

Say, say you love me
Oh, I love you

Baby, all my love is waiting for you
My baby, ow
