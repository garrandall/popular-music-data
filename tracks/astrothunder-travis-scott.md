Yeah

Seem like the life I feel
Seem like the life I feels a little distant, yeah
Seems like the life I need
Seems like the life I need's a little distant, yeah

Like the remedy, yeah
Sit back while I watch it on repeat
Do it on repeat repeat
Sins controllin' me, yeah
Angels, halos over me
I need blessings and my peace
You been out the streets, yeah
Wilin' out on me and my Gs
We been goin' for a week
Now you wanna peak, yeah
Hands up, why they tryna reach?
I can't even get that deep
Told you I don't teach (yeah)
Practice, oh, no, never preach
Practice, oh, no, never preach
Infiltrate the enemy, moving on them randomly

Feels like the life I need a little distant, yeah
Feels like
Feels like the life I need, yeah
Feels like the life I need a little distant, yeah (yeah, yeah)
