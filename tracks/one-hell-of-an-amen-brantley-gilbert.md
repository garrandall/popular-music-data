The preacher said he died too young
Over there totin' that gun
For Uncle Sam and our freedom
Mom and daddy dressed in black
They folded up that flag
Handed it to dad
And started prayin'
Yeah he went out 21 guns blazin'

And that's one hell of an amen
That's the only way to go
Fightin' the good fight
'Til the good Lord calls you home
So be well my friend
'Til I see you again
Yeah this is our last goodbye
But it's a hell of an amen, amen

Doctor said he ain't got long
He just smiled said bring it on
Well if you think I'm scared
You got me all wrong
No, a little cancer can't break me
My heart's right and I believe
We all hit our knees
And started prayin'
No he never gave up
Said the good Lord's waitin'

And that's one hell of an amen
That's the only way to go
Fightin' the good fight
'Til the good Lord calls you home
So be well my friend
'Til I see you again
Yeah this is our last goodbye
But it's a hell of an amen

So be well my friend
'Til I see you again
This is our last goodbye
It's a hell of an amen
Amen
That's a hell of an amen
