Habibi lei Habibi lei

Habibi...

I need your love
I need your love
I need your lo-lo-lo-love
Let me love you oh-oh oh

If I love ya love me right back
That kind of love that keep you coming back
If I love ya love me right back
Don't ever leave me, girl don't do me that
So please (stay) Don't walk (away)
Give me another chance, me love you the right (way)
My true feelings pushing up
Woman you love me, can't do without

Who am I without you by my side?
Every little piece of my heart broken in the dark
Wishing I could hold you now...
When you were here for me, I was not there for you
I was too blind, couldn't see what you did for me
Now I don't know what to do

Ladi ladi ram tam, ladi ladi ram tam
I'll be right here for you
Ladi ladi ram tam, ladi ladi ram tam
I'll be calling out for you, can you hear me?
(toca toca latino)

Habibi lei Habibi lei

Habibi lei Habibi lei
Habibi...

I need your love
I need your love
I need your lo-lo-lo-love
Let me love you oh-oh oh
Let me love you oh-oh oh

And every time that you think to leave
I'll be don't don't don't don't go
And every time that you think of me
I'll want your big bright smile, just glow
There's no-one else but you, girl
And when mi look at mi future, see you girl
My true feelings pushing up
Woman you love me, can't do without

Habibi lei Habibi lei
Habibi lei lei lei lei lei lei
Habibi lei Habibi lei
Habibi...

I need your love

I need your lo-lo-lo-love
Let me love you oh-oh oh
