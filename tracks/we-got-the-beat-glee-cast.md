Rachel
See the people walkin' down the street
Fall in line just watchin' all their feet
They don't know where they wanna go
They're walkin' in time

Rachel & New Directions!
They got the beat
They got the beat
They got the beat
Yeah, they got the beat

Santana
All the kids just gettin' out of school
They can't wait to hang out and be cool
Hang around 'til quarter after twelve
That's when they fall in line

Santana & New Directions!
They got the beat
They got the beat
Kids got the beat
Yeah, kids got the beat

Brittany
Go-go music really makes us dance
Do the pony, puts us in a trance
Do what you see, just give us a chance
That's when we fall in line

Brittany & New Directions!
'Cause we got the beat
We got the beat
We got the beat
Yeah, we got it!

(We got the beat)
(We got the beat)
(We got the beat)

Santana
Everybody get on your feet (We got the beat)
Brittany
We know you can dance to the beat (We got the beat)
Rachel
Jumpin', get down (We got the beat)
All
'Round and 'round and 'round!

Santana (with New Directions)
We got the beat (We got the beat)
Brittany
We got the beat (We got the beat)
Rachel
We got the beat (We got the beat)
Santana
We got the beat (We got the beat)
Rachel
We got the beat (We got the beat)
We got the beat!
