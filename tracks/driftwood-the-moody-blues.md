Just like the driftwood of a dream
Left of the seashore of sleep
Just like the words that wouldn't rhyme
Lost in the desert of time
Time waits for no one at all
No, not even you
You thought you'd seen it all before
You really thought you knew

I don't remember what was said
In the confusion that night
I only know what's on my mind
What's in the future we will decide
Time waits for no one at all
No, not even you
You thought you'd seen it all before
You really thought you knew

I've shattered the illusion
Of fortune and of fame
But darling now I know you
Life could never be the same
Oh no... don't leave me driftwood
On the shore

Time waits for no one my love
No, not even you
You thought you'd seen it all before
You really thought you knew

I've shattered the illusion
Of forture and of fame
I'm waking up
I'm reaching up
I'm getting up from this game
Oh no... don't leave me driftwood
On the shore
Oh no... don't, don't leave me driftwood
On the shore...
