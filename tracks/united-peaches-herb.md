Ooo oo oo, yeah
Honey you are my shining star
Don't you go away, oh baby
Wanna be right here were you are until my dying day, yeah baby
So many have tried, tried to find a love like yours and mine
Mmm mmm mmm

Honey I'll never leave you lonely
Give my love to you only

Honey you are my shining star don't you go away, no baby
Wanna be right here were you are until my dying day yeah baby
Feels so good when we're lying here next to each other lost in love, yeah baby
