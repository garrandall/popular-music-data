Don't need a roller or a limousine
I don't need my picture in a magazine
I don't need approval from a chosen few
Tell you what I do need, I need you

Don't need no fixtures or feelings of home
I'm so unfurnished, I'm on my own
I don't need reminding, when the rent is due
Tell you what I do need, I need you

I need you like a fly needs a plane
I need you like a ball needs a game
I need you like a pool needs a cue
I need you, need you, need you, I need you

I don't need no covered kisses for company
I don't want no washed up dishes, soft soapin' me
I don't need no Cinderella in high heeled shoes
I tell you what I do need, I need you
(I need you)

Oh, I need you like a fly needs a plane
I need you like a ball needs a game
I need you like a shot needs to shoot
I need you, need you, need you, I need you

I need you, need you, need you
(I need you)
Said, I want you
(I need you)
I need you, need you, need you
(I need you)

But I want, I want you
(I need you)
Yes, I need
(I need you)

I need you, need you, need you
(I need you)
I want you, want you, want you
(I need you)
