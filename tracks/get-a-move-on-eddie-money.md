Ain't had enough
How long has it been?

But I got nothin' put it in

Money wants money
Don't make me laugh
Money got funny
It's a thing of the past

Got to move on
Got to move on

Hurry up and heat it up
I just can't seem to get enough
Grab your coat, get on my bike
We're gonna leave here tonight
We're gonna leave here tonight

So, come on, come on
Get a move on
I said, "Come on, come on
Get a move on"

If that we stay here, we're just gonna fight
We could be happy, the rest of our lives
You keep me waitin' when I wanna go
Let's go

Come on, come on
Get a move on
I said, "Come on, come on
Get a move on"

Baby got to move now
Come on, come on
Get a move on

It's some kind of move, oh

Who's that chick, what's her name?
She used to be on the radio
Well, she sang so sweet and she sang so low
Does anybody know?
Does anybody recollect besides me?

Who can remember if you don't hear it no more?
Someone don't play it, you'll forget it for sure
I can't take it no more
I can't take it no more, no

Baby, come on, come on
Get a move on
I said, "Come on, come on
Get a move on"

Baby, can you hear it now?
Come on, come on
Get a move on
Won't you, come on, come on
Get a move on

Won't you, come on, come on
Get a move on
