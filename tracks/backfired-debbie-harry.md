Backfired. Your plan, your plan backfired
Backfired. My man, your plan backfired in your face

You came into my life to test me
Your diplomatic drag depressed me
The glitter in your eyes undressed me

You were polished slick. Really thick
Wasting time dropping lines like "I could get you into movies"

But we would up at HoJo's for hamburgers to go!

Backfired. Your plan backfired
Backfired. My man, your plan backfired in your face

To steal my mind was your objective
The way you spoke was too aggresive
The silly jokes were not impressive

Like "a traveling salesman met...", "farmer with three daughters", yet!
All the quips were so suggestive

Then we ran down to HoJo's for hamburgers to go!

Backfired. Your plan backfired
Backfired. My man, your plan backfired in your face

Well, come here my little dear, I've got what it takes
Give me just what I want and I'll give you a break
Well, don't slip on your lips cuz you're talking so fast
Buying for first, crying for last
Well come on my little lady, don't shoot me down
I've got strong connections all over town
Just drop to a dead stop
What?

Backfired. Your plan backfired
Backfired. My man, your plan backfired in your face

You were polished slick. Really thick
Wasting time dropping lines
Backfired
"A traveling salesman met...", "a farmer with three daughters", yet!
Backfired
Backfired
Your plan backfired
Couldn't work out no...
Backfired
My man, your plan backfired in your face
It backfired

Backfired
Your plan just backfired
Oh no, it couldn't work out, backfired
Better get a new line and try it again
Slick performance on demand
Backfired

You better back up fast and head out west
You may still collect
Backfired
It backfired
Your plan backfired
Too bad...
Backfired
My man, your plan backfired

Well, come here my little dear, I've got what it takes
Give me just what I want and I'll give you a break
Well, don't slip on your lips cuz you're talking so fast
Buying for first, crying for last
Well come on my little lady, don't shoot me down
I've got strong connections all over town
Just drop to a dead stop
