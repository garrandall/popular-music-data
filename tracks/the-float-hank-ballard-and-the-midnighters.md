I'm a spaceman
Sent from the moon
Shot off a missole
And heard this tune
Let's float, let's float
Let's float, let's float
Baby, let's float
Now lift your arms
Just like a bird
And listen for
The magic word
Let's float, oh, let's float
Let's float, let's float
Baby, let's float, hey now
Now watch those
Planets go whizzing by
Float with me
We're going up high
Let's float, oh, let's float
Let's float, let's float
Baby, let's float
Come on, baby, come on
Mercury, Mars
And Venus too
Float with me
That's the thing to do
Let's float, oh
Come on, baby, let's float
Let's float, let's float
Come on, let's float
Now my missile
Is down to earth
I'm floating for
All I'm worth
Let's float, come on now
Baby, let's float
Let's float, let's float
Baby, let's float
Come on, baby, let's go
Let's float, come on, baby
Let's float, woo
Let's float, let's float
Let's float, let's float
Baby, let's float
Let's float
Raise your hands high
Let's float
Come on, real high
Let's float, let's float
That's alright...
