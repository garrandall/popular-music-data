Souvenirs are signs that take you away
Souvenirs will make you leave here today
For a world of joy and living
A world of love and giving away far away

Souvenirs are signs that take me away
Souvenirs will make me leave here today
For a world of joy and living
A world of love and giving away far away

'Cause all we need is a world of dreams
Forgotten feelings come back in streams
Come join us don't hesitate
Just be yourself be free let's be free

'Cause all we need is a world of dreams
Forgotten feelings come back in streams
Come join us don't hesitate
Just be yourself be free let's be free

Souvenirs are signs that take you away
Souvenirs will make you leave here today
For a world of joy and living
A world of love and giving away far away

Souvenirs will leave the day far behind
Souvenirs, your secret signs in the mind
In a world of love and giving a world
Where joy of living we call paradise

Let's find a place with celebrations and songs
And souvenirs go along let's keep on moving

We'll find a place with celebrations and dance
And souvenirs and romance
We'll keep on moving

Let's find a place
Let's find a place
Let's find a place
Let's keep on moving

We'll find a place
We'll find a place
We'll find a place
We'll keep on moving

Let's find a place with celebrations and songs
And souvenirs go along let's keep on moving

Let's find a place with celebrations and dance
And souvenirs and romance
We'll keep on moving
Let's find a place
Let's find a place
Let's find a place
