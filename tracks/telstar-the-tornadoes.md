You counted 74 swans on the canal
You counted 74 swans on the canal
You were glad it was an even number
Everybody had another
No one was facing this cold alone
This cold alone, cold alone, cold alone
They were gathered between bridges
In the steely sunshine
Bookend by ice on either side
Here comes a pair on final approach
Wings like great white bellows
Gathering inward to land and it looks like grace
Looks like grace, looks like grace
You counted 74 swans on the canal
You counted 74 swans on the canal
You were glad it was an even number
Everybody had another
No one was facing this cold alone
I thought you were right there with me
On my left side
Too eager to get where I'm going
I left you behind
But you were on the last watch
The passing of the torch
You counted 74 swans, now there's 75
