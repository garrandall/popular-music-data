There's got to be a word that means more than love
But I can't seem to find it
There's got to be a word that says more than love
Cause now I'm stuck behind it

If Mr. Webster gave it more thought
I'm sure that he would have had for this feeling I have
Another word beyond the meaning of love

There's got to be a word that means more than love
But I just can't convey it
There's got to be a word that says more than love
I'll talk until I say it

In each book that I take from the shelf
The deeper the plot, the closer it gets
To just the word love and nothing beyond

I think our words are due for a change
So what say we start
Let us rearrange that from which we never can part

To the one and only word that means more than love
And well all feel much better
Crazy tho it seems I feel more than love
So far beyond each letter

I've been this way since heaven knows when
And if I had it there to do over again
I'd spare myself the misery of words
