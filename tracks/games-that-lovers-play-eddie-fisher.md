There are games that many,
Foolish lovers play.
Blindly chasing happy endings,
Come what may.

Never caring,
Who gets hurt,
Along the way.

Let's not play those games,
That lovers play.

Sometimes lovers,
Hurt each other,
Telling lies.
Acting out charades,
Behind their,
Smiling eyes.

If you love me, darling,
You must realize,
We can't play those games,
That lovers play.

When I whisper,
I'll be yours eternally.
In my heart I feel,
Our love is meant to be.

It's not just to have you share,
One dream with me.
I'm not playing games
That lovers play.

Sometimes lovers hurt each other,
Telling lies.
Acting out charades,
Behind their smiling eyes.

If you love me,
Darling, you must realize,
We can't play those games,
That lovers play.

Let's not play those games,
That lovers play.
