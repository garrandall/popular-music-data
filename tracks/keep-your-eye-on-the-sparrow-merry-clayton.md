Don't go to bed with
No price on your head, no
Don't do the crime
If you can't do the time, uh uh
Keep your eye on the sparrow
When the going gets narrow
Don't roll the dice
If you can't pay the price
No, don't do it
Don't run your feet
Down no deadend street
Keep your eye on the sparrow
When the going gets narrow
(Don't do it)
Keep your eye on the sparrow
When the going gets narrow
Don't do me dirt or you're
Gonna get hurt, yeah (don't do it)
Don't run away til
You hear what I say
Keep your eye on the sparrow
When the going get a
Little rough and narrow
Yeah, baby, keep your eye
Keep your eye on the sparrow
Honey, when the going
When the going gets narrow
