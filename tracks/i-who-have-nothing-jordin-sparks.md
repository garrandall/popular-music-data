I, I who have nothing 
I, I who have no one
Adore you and want you so 
I'm just a no one, with nothing to give you but oh 
I love you 
You, you buy her diamonds 
Bright, sparkling diamonds 
But believe me, dear, when I say 
That she can give you the Word

But she'll never love you the way I love you 
You can take her any place she wants 
To fancy clubs and restaurants 
But I can only watch you with 
My nose pressed up against the window pane 
I, I who have nothing 
I, I who have no one 
Must watch you, go dancing by 
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else 
When darling it is I 
Who love you
