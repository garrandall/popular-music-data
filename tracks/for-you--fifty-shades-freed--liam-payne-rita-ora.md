In your eyes I'm alive
Inside you're beautiful
Something so unusual
In your eyes I know I'm home

Every tear, every fear
Gone with the thought of you
Changing what I thought I knew
I'll be yours for a thousand lives

I'm free as a bird when I'm flying in your cage
I'm diving in deep and I'm riding with no brakes
And I'm bleeding your love, and you're swimming in my veins
You've got me now

Been waiting for a lifetime for you
Been breaking for a lifetime for you
Wasn't lookin' for love 'til I found you (ooh na, na, ay)
For love, 'til I found you


Skin to skin
Breathe me in
Feeling your kiss on me
Lips are made of ecstasy
I'll be yours for a thousand lives (a thousand lives)


I'm free as a bird when I'm flying in your cage (so lost)
I'm diving in deep and I'm riding with no brakes (no luck)
And I'm bleeding your love, and you're swimming in my veins
You've got me now (now)


Been waiting for a lifetime for you
Been breaking for a lifetime for you
Wasn't lookin' for love 'til I found you (ooh na, na, ay)
For love 'til I found you
Been waiting for a lifetime for you
Been breaking for a lifetime for you
Wasn't lookin' for love 'til I found you (ooh na, na, ay)
For love 'til I found you


I'm free as a bird when I'm flying in your cage
I'm diving in deep and I'm riding with no brakes
And I'm bleeding your love, and you're swimming in my veins
You've got me now

Been waiting for a lifetime for you
Been breaking for a lifetime for you
Wasn't looking for love 'til I found you (ooh na, na, ay)
For love 'til I found you
Been waiting for a lifetime for you
Been breaking for a lifetime for you
Wasn't looking for love 'til I found you (ooh na, na, ay)
For love 'til I found you

Wasn't lookin' for love 'til I found you (ooh na, na, ay)
For love 'til I found you
