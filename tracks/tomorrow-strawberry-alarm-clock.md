Tomorrow
Things won't be the same
Tomorrow
Life would be a different game

But right now I am with you, and
Together we can make it through
Ba-ba-ba

Forever
Our love might last
Forever
Will it come too fast

But right now I am with you, and
Together we can make it through
Ba-ba-ba

We live in a world
Of carnivals and clowns
And buildings to the sky
That make us want to fly

But right now I am with you, and
Together we can make it through
Ba-ba-ba

We live in a world
Of carnivals and clowns
And buildings to the sky
That make us want to fly

But right now I am with you, and
Together we can make it through
But right now I am with you, and
Together we can make it through
Wow
