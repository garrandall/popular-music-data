I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run


Yeah, you and nothing stays the same
If you're ready for love be ready for all the pain
Got a taste of the flame and look at who I become
A grown-ass man playing immature games
I feel stupid, how the hell could I do this?
I knew that you were clueless
And all I did was abuse it
I know that it was foolish
I know that it was ruthless
But if I really knew it
Why the hell did i go through it?
I remember when you called
I told you that I was sleeping
But other girls I was meeting
I was too busy cheating
And it just kept repeating and repeating
Like every single evening
To the point I didn't even
Give a damn if you were leaving
But I do now, and now I know
You don't realize what you have
'Till the day you see it go
And maybe we'll try again
Forget what I did before
Forgive me for my mistakes
I guess that we'll never know
It's a story untold...


I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run


And the story goes on, it's the same old song
Flashback to Kat
When I was staying at her home
I used to sleed at hers
'Cause she'd hate sleeping alone
I go and grab the cover
Then a text comes through her phone
And It was from a guy
Who was older than me
He said "call me when you get this
And I'll come when he leaves
And I just couldn't believe
That she was cheating on me
And still had the F**king nerve
That she could blame it on me
Like "Anth what did you expect?
You ain't never around."
"...It was my birthday last week
You weren't even in town..."
"...and yeah,you bough me a gift
But baby that wasn't s**t..."
"...I don't care about the money
That you spend on my wrist..."
"...I cried so many tears
Because you never were here..."
"...and we talked,and we fought
But You just never appeared..."
"...I told you so many times
It must have webt through your ears..."
"...'Cause you dont care about us babe
Only your career."
And that's real


I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
