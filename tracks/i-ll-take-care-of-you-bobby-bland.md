I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
But if you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you

I, I've loved and lost, the same as you
So you see, I know just what you've been through
But if you'll let me, here's what I'll do
Oh, I just got to take care of you

You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to cry
For I'll be there beside you
To dry your weeping eyes

So darling, tell me that you'll be true
For there is no doubt in my mind, I know what I want to do
And just as sure as one and one is two
Oh, you know I'll take care of you

I'll take care of you
I'll take care of you
