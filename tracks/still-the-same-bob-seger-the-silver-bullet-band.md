You always won every time you placed a bet
You're still damn good no one's gotten to you yet
Every time they were sure they had you caught
You were quicker than they thought
You'd just turn your back and walk

You always said the cards would never do you wrong
The trick you said was never play the game too long
A gambler's share the only risk that you would take
The only loss you could forsake
The only bluff you couldn't fake

And you're still the same
I caught up with you yesterday
(Still the same)
(Still the same)
Moving game to game
No one standing in your way
Turning on the charm
Long enough to get you by

(Still the same)
(Still the same)
You're still the same

You still aim high...
(Still the same)
(Still the same)
(Still the same)
(Still the same)
There you stood everybody watched you play
I just turned and walked away
I had nothing left to say
'Cause you're still the same
(Still the same)
(Baby-baby still the same)
You're still the same
(Still the same)
(Baby-baby still the same)
Moving game to game
(Still the same)
(Baby-baby still the same)
Some things never change
(Still the same)
(Baby-baby still the same)
Ah you're still the same
(Still the same)
(Baby-baby still the same)
Still the same
(Still the same)
