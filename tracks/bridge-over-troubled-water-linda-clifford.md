When you need a friend
When you need a friend
When you need a friend
When you need a friend

I'm on your side
(Yes, indeed)
When friends can't be found

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

When you need a friend
(And, yes, you will)
When you need a friend

When you're weary
Feeling small
When tears are in your eyes
I'll dry them all

(I'm on your side)
I'm on your side
When times get rough
And friends just can't be found

Like a bridge over troubled waters
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled waters
I will lay me down, yeah

Gonna lay me down
(When you need a friend)
You've got a friend
(When you need a friend)

When you're down and out
When you're out there on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you

(I'll take your part)
I'll take your part
When darkness comes
And pain is all around

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Gonna lay me down, yeah

If you need a friend
If you need a friend
If you need a friend
(Yeah, you got a friend now)
If you need a friend

Sail on, silver bird
Sail on by
Your time has come, oh, to shine
Your dreams are on their way
Oh, yeah

(See how they shine)
Oh, see how they shine
If you ever need a friend
I'm sailing right behind

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind

Gonna ease your mind now
You've got a friend, yeah
Let me ease your mind
Oh, you've got a friend
All right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Gonna lay me down
(When you need a friend)

When you need a friend
(Yeah, gotta feel real)
(Feeling good, wanna be)
(Wanna be your friend)
When you need a friend

When you need a friend
()
When you need a friend

When you need a friend
(I'm sailing right behind you)
(I'm sailing right behind you)
When you need a friend
When you need a friend

When you need a friend
When you need a friend
When you need a friend

When you need a friend
When you need a friend

When you need a friend
When you need a friend
When you need a friend
When you need a friend

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water

(Like a bridge, just a bridge over troubled water)
(I'm gonna lay me down)

Like a bridge over troubled water

(Just like a bridge over troubled water)
(I will lay me down)
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

When you need a friend
When you need a friend
When you need a friend
â€¦
