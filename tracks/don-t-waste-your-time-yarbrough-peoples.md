Don't waste your time
She’s my friend
I tell you
She ain't no good

Oh, oh ooh
Yeah, yeah

I can't stand to see someone
Take advantage of you
Knowing I care about you
The way I do

So don’t waste your time
She's my friend
And I tell you she ain't no good
Don't waste your time
She's my friend
And I tell you she ain't no good

She calls me on the phone
Each and every night
Bragging how she takes love
But never gives it back

So don't waste your time
She's my friend
And I tell you she ain’t no good
Don’t waste your time
She's my friend
And I tell you she ain’t no good

She told me that she loves me
She told me that she needed me
(No good)
She said I was the only one
(Don't waste your time)
And now you're saying
She's only out for fun

She don’t love you
She don't love you
She don't love you like I do

She don't love you
(Are you sure)
She don't love you
(Are you sure)
She don't love you like I do

(Don't waste your time)
But she told me that
She loved me, oh, yeah
(Don't waste your time)
But she told me
That she needed me
(Don't waste your time)

Oh, oh

Don't waste your time

(Are you sure)
She don't love you
She don't love you
(Are you sure)
She don't love you like I do

(Are you sure)
She don't love you
She don't love you
(Are you sure)
She don't love you like I do

Do you love me
And do you want me
Do you need me
(Don't waste your time)

I can't stand to see someone
Take advantage of you
I can't stand to see someone
Take advantage of you, yeah

I can't stand to see someone
Take advantage of you
I can't stand to see someone
Take advantage of you

(Don't waste your time)
And you say she's only out for fun
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

She told me that she loved me
(Don't waste your time)
(Don't waste your time)

She don't love you
(Are you sure)
She don't love you
(Are you sure)
She don't love you
(Are you sure) like I do

(Are you sure)
She don't love you
She don't love you
(Are you sure)
She don't love you like I do
(Are you sure)

Don't waste your time
(She said that she loves me)
She's my friend and I tell you
She ain't no good

Don't waste your time
(She said that she needs me)
She's my friend and I tell you
She ain't no good

(Don't waste your time)
She said that she loves me
And now you're telling me
She ain't no good

Don't waste your time

I can't stand to see someone
Take advantage of you
I can't stand to see someone
Take advantage of you, yeah

I can't stand to see someone
Take advantage of you
I can't stand to see someone
Take advantage of you

She's my friend
(She said she loved me)
And I tell you
She ain't no good
(Are you sure)

She don't love you
She don't love you
(Are you sure)
She don't love you like I do
(Are you sure)

She don't love you
(Are you sure)
She don't love you like I do
