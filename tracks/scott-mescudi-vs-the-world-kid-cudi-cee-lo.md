What up? How is everyone doing?
You are now in the World I am ruling
Take a minute to adjust for the wonderous
Clusterfuck of fun and enchantment
I promise you some Generation Next shit
Speak for the seller who I left with
Parallel levels in a dark, dark place
Tripped all you niggas to a dark, dark fate
The guy that you are with a smile up on my face
As the sun kisses us on the foreheads gently
Gentle with the drugs, heavy with the love
Iâma spit this on stage, watch models fill my club.
Money doesn't move me except on the literal.
G4 flights, now weâre off to Australia
I wanna see more of the World,
these are more than just words, these are facts from a winner


This is a journey, into the horizon
hope you can see that, if its real to you
we can meet on the other side,
on the other side
ayee
this is a journey, into the horizon
hope you can see that, if its real to you
then we can meet on the other side,
on the other side


What up? How is everyone feeling?
I hope you understand what youâre hearing
Take a minute to roll up for the wonderous
Clusterfuck of darkness and evil
I will play the Yin and the Yang for ya
And my jeans will be off with the little skinnies
Upgraded, fitted into the T
Work hard, making sure I donât become a memory
Hard to press on when the memories remember me
And they always find the perfect moment
High speed. Iâm a minimal slum.
Lost in the wind, Iâve lost all my friends
Maybe they were never meant to be acquainted
Money seems to make everything tainted
Everybody mad cause they stuck.
One less.
Took what I wanted and I did it all blunted.
Oh oh


This is a journey, into the horizon
hope you can see that.
If its real to you,
we can meet on the other side.
On the other side.
ayee
this is a journey, into the horizon
hope you can see that, if its real to you
then we can meet on the other side,
on the other side

This is a journey, into the horizon
hope you can see that.
If its real to you
we can meet on the other side.
On the other side.
This is a journey, into the horizon
hope you can see that.
If its real to you
Then we can meet on the other side.
On the other side.
