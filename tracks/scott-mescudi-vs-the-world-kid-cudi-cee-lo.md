What up? How is everyone doing?
You are now in the world I am ruling
Take a minute to adjust for the wondrous
Clusterfuck of fun and enchantment

I promise you some generation next shit
Speak for the seller who I left with
Parallel levels in the dark, dark place
Tripped all you niggas to a dark, dark fate

Guided you all with a smile up on my face
As the sun kisses us on the foreheads gently
Gentle with the drugs, heavy with the love
I'ma spit this on stage, watch models fill my club

Nothing dims the mood except for the lateral
G4 flights, now we're off to Australia
I wanna see more of the world
These are more than just words
These are facts from a winner

This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
We can meet on the other side
On the other side, ay

This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
We can meet on the other side
On the other side

What up? How is everyone feeling?
I hope you understand what you're hearing
Take a minute to roll up for the wondrous
Clusterfuck of darkness and evil

I will play the yin and the yang for ya
And my jeans will be off with the love of skinnies
Upgraded, fitted into the T
Work hard, make sure I don't become a memory

Hard to press on when the memories remember me
And they always find the perfect moment
High speed, I'm a minimal slum
I'm lost in the wind, I've lost all my friends

Maybe they were never meant to be acquainted
Money seems to make everything tainted
Everybody mad 'cause they stuck one less
Took what I wanted and I did it all blunted, oh oh

This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
We can meet on the other side
On the other side, ay

This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
We can meet on the other side
On the other side

This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
We can meet on the other side
On the other side, ay

This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
We can meet on the other side
On the other side
