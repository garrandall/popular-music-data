(You're not a kid anymore
You're not a kid anymore.)

When people ask of me
'What would you like to be now that you're not a kid anymore?'
(You're not a kid anymore.)
I know just what to say
I answer right away
There's just one thing I've been wishing for

I wanna be Bobby's girl
I wanna be Bobby's girl
That's the most important thing to me
And if I was Bobby's girl
If I was Bobby's girl
What a faithful, thankful girl I'd be

Each night I sit at home
Hoping that he will phone
But I know Bobby has someone else
(You're not a kid anymore.)
Still in my heart I pray
There soon will come the day
When I will have him all to myself

I wanna be Bobby's girl
I wanna be Bobby's girl
That's the most important thing to me
And if I was Bobby's girl
If I was Bobby's girl
What a faithful, thankful girl I'd be
What a faithful, thankful girl I'd be
I wanna be Bobby's girl
I wanna be Bobby's girl
I wanna be Bobby's girl
