Would you like to swing on a star
(Oh, oh, oh)
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
(Oh, oh, oh)

And be better off than you are
(Oh, oh, oh)
Or would you rather be a mule
(Yeah, yeah, talking 'bout a mule now)

A mule is an animal
With long funny ears
He kicks up at anything he hears
(Just like you, Dee)

His back is brawny
And his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid
With a stubborn streak

And by the way
If you hate to go to school
(Which I do)
You may grow up to be a mule
(I don't wanna grow up
And be a mule)

Well, would you like to
Swing on a star (okay)
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
(One moonbeam, two moonbeam)

And be better off than you are
(Oh, oh, oh)
Or would you rather be a pig
(Yeah, yeah, talking 'bout a pig now)

A pig is an animal
With dirt on his face (yeah)
His shoes are a terrible disgrace
(Look who's talking)

He's got no manners
When he eats his food
(You gobble)
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude

But if you don't care
A feather or a fig
(That's the truth)
You may grow up to be a pig
(Not if I can help it, baby)

Oh, oh, oh (oh, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh

Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
You could be swinging on a star

Oh, oh, oh, yeah
We could be swinging on a star
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
We could be swinging on a star
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
We could be swinging on a star
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
We could be swinging on a star
