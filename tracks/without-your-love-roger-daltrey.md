You can show me the way
Give me a sunny day
But what does it mean
Without your love

And if I could travel far
If I could touch the stars
Where would I be
Without your love

Whenever I get to feeling
Down and out
I think about what you said
And then I'd give out

And if I could fly away
If I could sail today
Where would I go
Without your love

You can show me the way
And give me a sunny day
But what does it mean
Without your love

And if I could travel far
If I could touch the stars
Where would I be
Without your love

And if I ever wonder away
Too far
You'd come looking for me with
Open arms

I could forget my home
Be like a rolling stone
But who would I be
Without your love

And what does it mean
Without your love
Where would I be?
