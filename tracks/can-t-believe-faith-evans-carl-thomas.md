I always dreamed that everything would be okay
With me and you, I was wrong
When I looked into your eyes I didn't see all the things
I used to see, what's going on?

You gave me reasons to believe
That we were always meant to be
But now I see you were wrong
You can't keep running back to me
With all those baby, baby pleases, no more, no more

Never imagined you would be
A faded picture I'm emotional
It's so believing your deceiving
It's official, I'm emotional

I can't forget that night I saw you in the corner
Wrapped up tight, you were warm, oh
Slow dancing on the floor while I was watching
From the door so hurt, there you were

You gave me reasons to believe
That we were always meant to be
But now I see you were wrong
You can't keep running back to me
With all those baby baby pleases no more, no more

Never imagined you would be
A faded picture, I'm emotional
It's so believing your deceiving
It's official, I'm emotional

You had your chance
But you threw it all away
Thought you had my love always

I don't understand
How you think that we could stay
In total unhappiness

Never imagined you would be
A faded picture I'm emotional
It's so believing your deceiving
It's official, I'm emotional

Never imagined you would be
A faded picture I'm emotional
It's so believing your deceiving
It's official, I'm emotional

Never imagined you would be
A faded picture I'm emotional
It's so believing your deceiving
It's official, I'm emotional
