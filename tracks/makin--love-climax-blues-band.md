You got me thinkin' bout moving
To where the living is slow
And the days of take-it-easy, ooh
Feel like a river flow

Someplace high up in the mountains
Sippin' on a little moonshine
And as long as you are with me, ooh
Everything will be fine

'Cause it won't matter 'bout the money
We'll have all that we need
Won't have to worry 'bout them knockin' on the door
'Cause our love is guaranteed

We'd have a different situation
You'll be my security
We'll spend a lifetime in the country
Build up our equity

Spend every evening by the fire
In a house made of wood
Dancin' to old soul records
And a little bit of Johnny B. Goode

Ooh, maybe one day start a family
A boy and a girl
Makin' us a little piece of heaven
Ooh, at the top of the world

Spend every evening by the fire
In a house made of wood
Dancin' to old soul records
And a little bit of Johnny B. Goode

Ooh, maybe one day start a family
A boy and a girl
Makin' us a little piece of heaven
Ooh, at the top of the world
Makin' us a little piece of heaven
Ooh, at the top of the world
Makin' us a little piece of heaven
Ooh, at the top of the world
