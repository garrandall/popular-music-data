Running around in
The towns and cities
There are millions of people
Without a face

Don't you be sad and
Don't you think it's a pity
This is the way of the human race

Running around and
Trying to find a reason
For carrying on until the
Day that they die

Looking for answers
From season to season
Looking so hard that it is
Passing them by

And what do they do
At the end of the day
They take all their troubles
And hide them away
Ride away


(Making love)
Making love, making love
Making love, making love
Making love, making love
(Making love)
Making love, making love
Making love, making love
Making love, making love

Running around and
Making their money
Running around and
Try to make some more

Isn't it crazy
And isn't it funny
Were millions of lovers
The night before

And what do they do
At the end of the day
They take all their troubles
And hide them away
Ride away



Making love
Making love

And what do they do
At the end of the day
They take all their troubles
And hide them away
Ride away
