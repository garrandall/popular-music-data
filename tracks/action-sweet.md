So you think you'll take another piece of me
To satisfy your intellectual need
(Do you want?)
Do you want action?
(Action, action, action)

Gonna bring you down
'Cause you're pushin' me
You gotta recognize my superiority

(Liar, liar, liar, liar)
You know you believed it!
(Liar, liar, liar, liar)
'Cause I'm the main man!
And that's why

Everybody wants a piece of the action!
Everybody needs a main attraction!
I got what everybody needs, satisfaction guaranteed!
Everybody wants a piece of the action...

Oh, I was suicidal 'cause she was my idol
Baby, baby, baby, bring it to your knees
Now, there was a time I would have walked the line
But you bled me dry
With your insatiable greed

(Liar, liar, liar, liar)
You know you believed it
(Liar, liar, liar, liar)
'Cause I'm the main man
And that's why

Everybody wants a piece of the action
Everybody needs a main attraction
I got what everybody needs, satisfaction guaranteed
Everybody wants a piece of the action

Do you want action, action?
Everybody wants, everybody needs
Everybody wants, everybody needs

Everybody wants a piece of the action
Everybody needs a main attraction
I got what everybody needs, satisfaction guaranteed
Everybody wants a piece of the action, action, action
