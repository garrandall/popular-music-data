For real, for real, for real this time (Yeah yeah)
For real, for real, for real this time

'Cause you make my earth quake, oh, you make my earth quake
Riding around, your love be shakin' me up and it's making my heart break
'Cause you make my earth quake, oh, you make my earth quake (Earthquake, ooh)
Riding around, your love be shakin' me up and it's making my heart break

Don't leave, it's my fault
Don't leave, it's my fault
Don't leave, it's my fault (Yeah)
'Cause when it all comes crashing down I'll need you

'Cause you make my earth quake, oh, you make my earth quake
Riding around, you're telling me something is bad and it's making my heart break
'Cause you make my earth quake, oh, you make my earth quake (Earthquake)
Riding around, your love be shakin' me up and it's making my heart break (You already know)

Ain't gotta ball, D. Rose, huh
Don't give a fuck 'bout none (Hol' up)
Beaming like fuck my lungs (Hol' up)
Now I might call my lawyer (Hol' up)
Plug gon' set me up (Hol' up)
Bih, don't set me up (Okay)

So in love

Don't leave, it's my fault (Fault)
Don't leave, it's my fault
Don't leave, it's my fault
'Cause when it all comes crashing down I'll need you

'Cause you make my earth quake
I don't want no competition, no
You don't want my conversation (I don't want no conversation)
I just need some confirmation on how you feel (For real)
You don't want no complication, no
I don't want no side 'formation (I don't want no side 'formation)
I don't even know about that cause I'm for real (For real)

I said don't leave, it's my fault (Come on)
I said don't leave, it's my fault (Two, two)
Don't leave, its, it's my fault girl (One, two, three)
Don't, do-do-do-do-do, I need
