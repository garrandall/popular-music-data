With a ho double hoop shaw
Riggle laba dope and the
Doodle and the daddle
And the puff of my smoke
And the heaping and the huffing
And the chicken and the choking
And the pickle up a doodle
In the middle of the day

Did you ever hear the story
Of Belinda Onlyque
She was courted by the devil
And she didn't know what to do

He came a-courting
Every evening

With a ho double hoop shaw
Riggle laba dope and the
Doodle and the daddle
And the puff of my smoke
And the heaping and the huffing
And the chicken and the choking
And the pickle up a doodle
In the middle of the day

So Belinda got to thinking
She would be the devil's wife
It was better that than being
An old maid all her life

He came a-courting
Every evening

With a ho double hoop shaw
Riggle laba dope and the
Doodle and the daddle
And the puff of my smoke
And the heaping and the huffing
And the chicken and the choking
And the pickle up a doodle
In the middle of the day

So Belinda told the devil
Sir, if I should marry you
Would you treat me like the devil
Or like better husbands do

He came a-courting
Every evening

With a ho double hoop shaw
Riggle laba dope and the
Doodle and the daddle
And the puff of my smoke
And the heaping and the huffing
And the chicken and the choking
And the pickle up a doodle
In the middle of the day

So the devil told Belinda
Now I'll fetch a load of bricks
And I'll build for you, a mansion
Right upon that fiddle sticks

He came a-courting
Every evening

With a ho double hoop shaw
Riggle laba dope and the
Doodle and the daddle
And the puff of my smoke
And the heaping and the huffing
And the chicken and the choking
And the pickle up a doodle
In the middle of the day

So the devil took Belinda and
He claimed her with a kiss
And no one has ever seen her
From that fatal day to this

He came a-courting
Every evening

With a ho double hoop shaw
Riggle laba dope and the
Doodle and the daddle
And the puff of my smoke
And the heaping and the huffing
And the chicken and the choking
And the pickle up a doodle
In the middle of the day

Now they say that she would
Still be living as the devil's wife
For he spends his time
Far away from marriage strife

But he won't come
Courting in the evening

He came a-courting
Every evening

With a ho double hoop shaw
Riggle laba dope and the
Doodle and the daddle
And the puff of my smoke
And the heaping and the huffing
And the chicken and the choking
And the pickle up a doodle
In the middle of the day

Pickle up a doodle
In the middle of the day
