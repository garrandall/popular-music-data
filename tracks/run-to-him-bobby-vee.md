If you've found another guy who
Satisfies you more than I do
Run to him
I'll step aside

If you think his lips can kiss you
Better than my lips can kiss you
Run to him
Forgive my pride

If someone else's arms can hold you
Better than my arms can hold you
Go to him
And show to him
All your devotion

If somebody else can make you
Happier than I can make you
Run to him
My tears will dry

If someone else's arms can hold you
Better than my arms can hold you
Go to him
And show to him
All your devotion

If somebody else can make you
Happier than I can make you
Run to him
My tears will dry

If you feel you want to love me
I'd be more than glad to love you
Love you till your life is done
But darling, if I'm not the one
Then run to him
