Hello?
Hey baby what's wrong?
What you need me to come over?
I'll be right over as soon as I can
As a matter of fact I'm on my way right now
Don't worry about anything
Cause I'm here for you baby
I'm here for you

It's me Ralph open the door
Oh why are you crying?
Look let me wipe your face
 and come here
You don't have to worry about it babe
I'm here now
What was the problem?
I told you you need to be with me
You're wasting your time
You want somebody just because they're giving you the little materialistic things
Driving you around in fancy cars that's not, it can't, that's not gonna make it baby
You need someone who's really there at heart
When you're gonna understand?
When you're gonna trust that I'm the man that you need?
Oh man, oh baby, if you only knew what I can offer you
I wanna show you all the things you're really missing
I wanna give you the true meaning of love
I mean I can give you cars
I can give you money
I can give you whatever it is you want
But I can also give you what you probably won't find anywhere else
Yeah that's what I'm saying
Can I hold you?
Come on let me hold you baby
Yeah I know that's better right?
You feel better already don't you?
Yeah I feel better
He's always letting your self down
I won't let you down
I promise
Is there anything else I can do for you?

You see you need someone who's there like a gentleman
If anybody can fit the description baby I can
Someone who cares and dares to give himself completely
You got it in me
You need a man with sensitivity
Cause I'm not the one to give you run arounds
 lifting you up and letting you down
So what can I do to make you see
The man you N-E-E-D is R-I-Z-Z
I'm trying my best to get through to you
There's no limitations to the things I would do for you
My heart is on a edge and it's hard to believe
That I have so much love to offer but no one to receive
So if you're willing to take a chance girl I'm ready to let you have it
It's right in front of your eyes but you gotta reach it in order to grab it
Just let me know if you want it baby cause 
S-E-N-T-I-V-I-T-Y

Is there anything else I can do for you?
No? Well then I think I'm gonna leave then
It's getting kinda late
No? Oh that's kinda sweety really
But I don't want you to get the wrong impression
You know, think I'm gonna take advantage of you or anything
Well I could fix you something to drink?
Would you like that?
Or I can make you something to eat?
I am not the best chef in the world but I think
 I can work up something for us
Would you like that?
Well you're not hungry?
Well what do you want then?
Oops
Listen baby I think I'd better go
No there'll be plenty of time for that
Some other time
But I'll stay and hold you all night if you want
No I won't go
I promise you I won't go
I told you
I'm here for you
No matter how long
No matter how far
No matter how hard it gets
I'm here for you
