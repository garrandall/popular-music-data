Someday I'll listen to my heart
And know it's turning me off
The echo tells me I can't stay
For one more minute,
For one more day.

Someday I'll open up a door
That leads me to some distant shore.
I'll listen only to the sound
Of my bare feet
Upon the ground.

I'll taste the wine in Kingston harbor,
I'll sing a song in old San Juan.
I'll kiss a girl in Barcelona,
Then I'll be free
To carry on.

Someday I'll find out how to give
And when I do, I'll start to live
I'll cast my eyes up to the sky
Then catch a star
And wave goodbye.

I'll taste the wine in Kingston harbor,
I'll sing a song in old San Juan.
I'll kiss a girl in Barcelona,
Then I'll be free
To carry on.

I'll taste the wine in Kingston harbor,
I'll sing a song in old San Juan.
I'll kiss a girl in Barcelona,
Then I'll be free
To carry on.

I'll taste the wine in Kingston harbor,
I'll sing a song in old San Juan.
I'll kiss a girl in Barcelona,
Then I'll be free
To carry on.
