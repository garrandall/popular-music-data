I just got your message, baby
So sad to see you fade away
(What in the world is this feeling
To catch a breath and leave me reeling?)
It'll get you in the end, it's God's revenge

Oh, I know I should come clean
But I prefer to deceive
(Everyday I walk alone
And I pray that God won't see me)

I know it's wrong
I know it's wrong

Tell me why
Is it I'm digging your scene?
I know I'll die
Baby

They put you in a home to fill in
Oh, but I wouldn't call that living
(I'm like a boy among men
I'd like a permanent friend)

I'd like to think that I was just myself again

Oh, tell me why
Is it I'm digging your scene?
I know I'll die
Baby

I just got your message, baby
So sad to see you fade away
(I'm like a boy among men
I'd like a permanent friend)

I'd like to think that I was just myself again

Oh, tell me why
Is it I'm digging your scene?
I know I'll die
Baby

Now tell me why
Is it I'm digging your scene?
I know I'll die
Baby

Oh, come on, baby

Oh, come on, baby
