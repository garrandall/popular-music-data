Here inside my paper cup
Everything is lookin' up
No one comes in, no one goes out
Nothin' to get hung up about

I'm free and it's so easy to get by
'Cause I don't try

In my paper cup, I have installed
A shower stall across the hall
Running water and a den
It's looking just like home again

I'm free and I've installed refrigerated air
You'd have to look inside
Before you know that I was there

And everybody says I'm quite insane
And someday I'll be going down the drain
I know they're right but I don't care
I feel no pain

Here inside my paper cup
Everything is lookin' up
No one goes out, no one comes in
It's lookin' just like home again

I'm free and it's so easy to get
The things I've always wanted
'Cause I don't really want 'em anymore

An' living ain't so bad without a rudder
An' life is kinda groovy in the gutter
If you know how, and I do
Yeah, and I do, we do too

So if you'd like to come along
We'll sing a little paper song
About a lonely paper plate
Who couldn't find a paper mate

I'm free, yes I'm free

And my life is lookin' up
From inside my paper cup
And I'm always lookin' up
From inside my paper cup

And my life is lookin' up
From inside my paper cup
And I'm always lookin' up
From inside my paper cup
