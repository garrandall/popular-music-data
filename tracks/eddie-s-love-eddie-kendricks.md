Ah (Eddie's love) Eddie's love


I could build you a palace of pearls
A tower of diamond rings
I could pave you a street with gold
But these are meaningless things
All the gifts in the world can't convey
What my heart has to say
What I'll give to you every day
All of my love, all of my love


Oh, oh, oh (Eddie's love) Eddie's love


I could recite you a poem so sweet
Compose a song to sing
I could write you a book of love
But these are meaningless things
All the words in the world can't convey
What my heart has to say
What I'll give to you every day
All of my love, all of my love


Oh, oh, oh (Eddie's love) Eddie's love


I could fly you beyond the sun
Fill your pockets with moon beams
I could capture for you a star
But these are meaningless things
All the dreams in the world can't convey
What my heart has to say
What I'll give to you every day
All of my love, all of my love


Oh, oh, oh, oh (Eddie's love) Eddie's Love (say, say)
I wanna say, oh, oh, oh, oh (Eddie's love) Eddie's love
If you want it, you got it (you got it) (oh, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh (Eddie's love) Eddie's love (I wanna say it) (say, say)
I wanna say it (say), I gotta say it (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh (Eddie's love) Eddie's love
(You, you, you got it) You got it!
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Eddie's love) Eddie's love
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) (Eddie's love)
