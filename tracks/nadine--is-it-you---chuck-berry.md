As I got on a city bus and found a vacant seat
I thought I saw my future bride walkin? up the street
I shouted to the driver "hey conductor, you must slow down
I think I see her please let me off this bus"

Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh, Nadine. Honey, is that you?
Seems like every time I see you darling you got something else to do

I saw her from the corner when she turned and doubled back
And started walkin toward a coffee colored Cadillac
I was pushin through the crowd to get to where she's at
And I was campaign shouting like a southern diplomat

Nadine, honey is that you?
Nadine. Honey, where are you?
Seems like every time I catch up with you, you're up to
Something new

Downtown searching for her, looking all around
Saw her getting in a yellow cab heading up town
I caught a loaded taxi, paid up everybody's tab
With a twenty-dollar bill, told him "catch that yellow cab"

Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh, Nadine. Honey, is that you?
Seems like every time I catch up with you, you're up to
Something new

She moves around like a wayward summer breeze
Go, driver, go, go, catch her pretty please
Moving through the traffic like a mounted cavalier
Leaning out the taxi window trying to make her hear

Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh, Nadine. Honey, is that you?
Seems like every time I catch up with you, you're up to
Something new
