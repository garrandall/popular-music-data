I-I-I have a heart I swear I do
But just not baby when it comes to you
I get so hungry when you say you love me (hush)
If you know what's good for you

I think you're hot I think you're cool
You're the kinda guy I'd stalk in school
But now that I'm famous, you're up my anus
Now I'm gonna eat you fool!

I eat boys up, breakfast and lunch
Then when I'm thirsty, I drink their blood
Carnivore animal,
I am a cannibal
I eat boys up, you better run

I am cannibal, cannibal, cannibal I am
I am cannibal, cannibal
I'll eat you up
I am
I am cannibal, cannibal, cannibal I am
I am cannibal, cannibal
I'll eat you up

Whenever you tell me I'm pretty
That's when the hunger really hits me
Your little heart goes pitter patter
I want your liver on a platter

Use your finger to stir my tea
And for dessert I'll suck your teeth
Be too sweet and you'll be a goner
Yep, I'll pull a Jeffrey Dahmer

I eat boys up, breakfast and lunch
Then when I'm thirsty, I drink their blood
Carnivore animal,
I am a cannibal
I eat boys up, you better run

I am cannibal, cannibal, cannibal I am
I am cannibal, cannibal
I'll eat you up
I am
I am cannibal, cannibal, cannibal I am
I am cannibal, cannibal
I'll eat you up

I am cannibal, cannibal, cannibal I am
I am cannibal, cannibal
I'll eat you up
I am
I am cannibal, cannibal, cannibal I am
I am cannibal, cannibal
I'll eat you up

I love you
I warned you
