Well, all right, somethin's got you goin' tonight
Doin' all she can, it's all right
Come on, can't you see?
That when we all let go
We get high on Rock 'n' Roll!

Journey to the stars
Rock 'n' Roll guitars, yeah!

I like to Rock
Some like it hard, baby
I like it, you like it
I like to Rock
I like to Rock

I can sing, that's the kind of life for me
Want it loose and fancy free
Come on, then let's go
And, it'll be all right
We can Rock 'n' Roll all night

Journey to the stars
Rock 'n' Roll guitars, yeah!

I like to Rock
Some like it hard, baby
I like it, you like it
I like to Rock
I like to Rock

Oh, I like to Rock
Some like it hard, baby, wooh!
I like it, you like it
I like to Rock
I like to Rock
