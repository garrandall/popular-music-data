You look at me and all you see
Is muscle and bone
Some lone red, out of his head
You're sure I must be stoned
Think you're being strong standin' all alone
Goin' through inspection
But I can see you're lonely like me
In a world that needs affection

Strong enough for battle
Strong enough to survive
Strong enough to be gentle
To a hard woman, soft inside

Ain't never hurry, her eyes look her hungry
Or love denied
Whisper in your ear, chase away your fear
There's nothin' to hide
Dreams come true when I'm making love with you
You know I'll do my best
If you want to try kick your legs high
I will do the rest

Strong enough for battle
Strong enough to survive
Strong enough to be gentle
To a hard woman, soft inside

Strong enough for battle
Strong enough to survive
Strong enough to be gentle
To a hard woman, soft inside
