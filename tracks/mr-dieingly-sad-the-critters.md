Just a breeze will muss your hair
But you smile away each little care
And if the rain should make you blue
You say tomorrow is a new
Blue be your eyes, blonde your hair
You realize beyond a care
Life's in a hurry, but
You've got no worry, you're
So mystifyingly glad
I'm Mr. Dieingly Sad

And when the leaves begin to fall
Answering old winter's call
I feel my tears, they fall like rain
Weeping forth the sad refrain
Blue, dark, and dim it may seem
You mark a grin, a moonbeam
Brightens your smile, pray tell me
How all the while you can be
So mystifyingly glad
I'm Mr. Dieingly Sad

You say "take my hand and walk with me
Wake this land and stop the sea
Show me love, unlock
All doors
I'm yours"

Then the tide rolls up to shore
I whisper low, "I love you more
More than even you could know"
Adore me do so I could show
I'm so mystifyingly glad
Not Mr. Dieingly Sad
