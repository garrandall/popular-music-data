It's raining again
I'm hearing its pitter patter down
It's wet in the street
Reflecting the lights and splashing feet
Nowhere to go
And nothing I have to do, have to do

It's raining again
I follow the Christmas lights down town
I'm leaving the flow
Of people walking all around
Round and round

I hear the sound of rain falling in my ears
Washing away the weariness like tears
I can feel my troubles running down
Disappear into the silent sound

Just walking along
My clothes are soaked right through to the skin
I haven't a doubt, that this is what life is all about
The sun and the rain
Scraps of brain washing down the drain

I feel the rain falling on my face
I can say there is no better place
Than standing up in the falling down
In so much rain I could almost drown

It's raining again
A crack in the clouds reveals blue skies
I've been feeling so low(low)
But now everything is on my side
The sun and the rain
Walk with me fill my heart again

I hear the rain falling in my ears
Washing away the weariness like tears
I can feel my troubles running down
Disappear into the silent sound

I feel the rain falling on my face
I can say there is no better place
Than standing up in the falling down
In so much rain I could almost drown

Do de do do de do do do
Do de do de do de do do do
