I don't need you
I don't need friendship
I don't need flowers in the spring
I don't need you
And you surely don't need me

I don't need love and affection
I don't need peace and harmony
I don't need you
And you surely don't need me

But we both want it bad enough
Yes, we both want it, don't we?
I don't need you baby
And I know you don't need me

I don't need your loving arms around me
All I need is to be free
That's what I keep telling myself
And I tell you, you don't need me

I don't need children in my old age
No more cluttered leaves around the tree
And I don't need you baby
And I know you don't need me

But we both want it bad enough
Yes, we both want it, don't we?
I don't need you baby
And I know you don't need me

And we don't need each other, baby
We don't need each other, baby
Or do we?
