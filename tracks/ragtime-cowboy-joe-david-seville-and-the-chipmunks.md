Oh how he sings
Raggy music to his cattle
As he swings
Back in forth in his saddle
On a horse


What a horse!


Who is syncopated gaited
And with such a funny meter
To the roar of his repeater!

How they run
When they hear the fella's gun
Because the western folks all know:
He's a high falutin'


Rootin' tootin'!


Son-of-a-gun from Arizona
He's some cowboy
Talk about your cowboy
Ragtime Cowboy Joe!



(Gunshots)


Look out, Sheriff! They're gettin' away!

(Gunshot)


Alvin, stop shooting that gun

(Gunshot)


Reach for the sky, you sidewinder!

(Gunshot)

Alvin, will you put that gun down!

(Gunshot)


Don't worry lady! I'll go get 'em!

(Loud gunshot)


Alvin!
Will you please put that thing down and get back here and sing!?


Oh how he sings
Raggy music to his cattle
As he swings
Back in forth in his saddle
On a horse


What a horse!


Who is syncopated gaited
And with such a funny meter
To the roar of his repeater!

How they run
When they hear the fella's gun
Because the western folks all know:
He's a high falutin'


Rootin' tootin'!


Son of a gun from Arizona
He's some cowboy
Talk about your cowboy
Ragtime Cowboy Joe!

(Gunshots to the beat)


High-ho, Alvin!
