I was five and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
I wore black you wore white
You would always win the fight

Bang bang, you shoot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shoot me down

Seasons came and change the time
I grew up I called you mine
You would always laugh and say
Remember when we used to play

Bang bang, I shot you down
Bang bang, you hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, I used to shoot you down

Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rangâ€¦

Now he's gone I don't know why
And 'till these days sometimes I cry
He didn't say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie

Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down
