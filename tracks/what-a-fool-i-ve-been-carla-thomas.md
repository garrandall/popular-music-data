I wake up crying
My pillow's wet
I keep remembering
How could I forget

I need him so
He's just got to know
So tell him, oh, tell him
What a fool I've been

What a fool I've been
What a fool I've been
What a fool I've been
Oh, yes, I have

I want him to know
How much I miss him
Would he forgive
If I return

I need him so
He's just got to know
So tell him, oh, tell him
What a fool I've been

What a fool I've been
(Such a fool)
What a fool I've been
(That I've been)
What a fool I've been

(Yes, I'm a fool)
What a fool I've been
(Yes, such a fool)
What a fool I've been

(Yes, I'm a fool)
What a fool I've been
(That I've been)
