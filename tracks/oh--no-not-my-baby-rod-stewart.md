When my friends told me you had someone new
I didn't believe a single word was true
I told them all I had faith in you
I kept a-right on sayin'

Oh, no, not my baby
Oh no, not my sweet baby
You're not like all those other girls
Who play with the men's hearts like they were toys

My mama told me, son when rumors spread
That there is truth somewhere
And you should use your head
But sure didn't listen to what she said
Don't you know I kept a-right on sayin'

Oh, no, not my baby
Oh no, not my sweet baby

You're not like all those other girls
Who lead you on and tell you lies
No, no, my baby

Tell me, baby
I don't believe what they say, no

Oh, no, not my baby
Oh no, not my sweet baby
Oh, no, not my baby
Oh no, not my sweet baby
Not my baby, not my baby
Not my baby, not my baby
Not my baby, not my baby
Not my sweet sweet baby
Not my baby, not my baby
Not my baby, not my baby
Not my baby, not my baby
No way, not my baby
Not my baby, not my baby
Not my sweet sweet baby
Oh, no, not my baby
Oh no, not my sweet baby
Oh, no, not my baby
Oh no, not my sweet baby
Oh, no, not my baby
Oh no, not my sweet baby
Oh, no, not my baby
Oh no, not my sweet baby
