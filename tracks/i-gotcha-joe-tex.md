You promised me it would be just us two yeah
And I'd be the only man kissin' on you

A little bit longer, now, hold it - COME ON!
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! HOLD IT!
Now ease up on me now, good god. HEY!

Good God
Hey

Good God

You made me a promise and you're gonna stick to it
You shouldn't have promised if you weren't gonna do it
You saw me and ran in another direction
I'll teach you to play with my affections

Now give it here!
You never shoulda promise to me, give it here!
Don't hold back now, give it here!
Don't say nothin', just give it here, COME ON!
Give it here! Give it here! Give it here! Give it here!
Give it to me NOW!

Good God

You tried to sneak by me now, didn't ya?
I gotcha!
