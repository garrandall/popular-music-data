Speak to the sky when ever things go wrong
and you know you're not talkin' to the air, to the air
and the world will look better from up there

Speak to the sky 'cause things can get ya down
and you know when you're talkin' to the Lord, to the Lord
the world will look better than before

And if I stumble and it seems that I am blind
or if the road I'm on seems awful hard to find
and though my conversation doesn't always rhyme
I always try to find some time to

Speak to the sky and tell you how I feel
and to know sometimes what I say ain't right
It's all right
cause I speak to the sky every night

And if I stumble and it seems that I am blind
or if the road I'm on seems awful hard to find
and though my conversation doesn't always rhyme
I always try to find some time to

Speak to the sky and tell you how I feel
and to know sometimes what I say ain't right
It's all right
cause I speak to the sky every night

Speak to the sky when ever things go wrong
and you know you're not talkin' to the air, to the air
and the world will look better from up there
and the world will look better from up there
and the world will look better from up there
