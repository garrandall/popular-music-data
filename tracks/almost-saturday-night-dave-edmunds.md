Outside my window
I can hear the radio
And I know that motor wagon is ready to fly
'Cause it's almost Saturday night

Bye bye tomorrow
Jody's gone to the rodeo
And you know some good old boys getting ready to ride
'Cause it's almost Saturday night

Gonna push all the clouds away
Let the music have its way
Let it steal my heart away
And you know I'm goin'

Outside, they're ringing
The night train is bringin' me home
When you hear that locomotion, get ready to ride
'Cause it's almost Saturday night

Gonna push all the clouds away
Let the music have its way
Let it steal my heart away
'Cause you know I'm goin'

Outside, they're ringin'
The night train is bringin' me home
When you hear that locomotion, get ready to ride
'Cause it's almost Saturday night

(Outside my window, outside)
It's almost Saturday night
(Outside, they're ringing, outside)
'Cause it's almost Saturday night
(Outside my window, outside)
Yeah, it's almost Saturday night
