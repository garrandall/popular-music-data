I..was waiting all my life to know you
(all about you)
And now..I'm staring in your eyes ocean blue
(I'm all about you)

And in our minds, it comes so easily
But theres a feeling comin over me
I want to show you, 
But theres nowhere we can really be free
Everybody's watchin'

Wouldn't it be good if we could be together

Take me away, 
Take me far away from here
I will run with you
Don't be afraid
Navigate and I will steer
Into the sun, we will run

I try...to remember when I was just a child
(In my roo-oom)
And my...imagination used to run wild
(I never knee-ew)

Then nothing ever as it seems to be
When a dream collides with our reality
It should be easy when two people love each other truly
Everybody's talkin'

Wouldn't it be good if they would understand us...

Take me away, 
Take me far away from here
I will run with you
Don't be afraid (afraid)
Navigate and I will steer
Into the sun, we will run...

We, will run.
Whoooaaa whoa whoa whoa
We, will run.
Oh yeah yeah yeaah

Wouldn't it be good if they would understand us
Wouldn't it be good if we could be together...
TAKE ME AWAY!

Take me away, (take me away)
Take me far away from here
I will run with you
Don't be afraid (Don't..Be..Afraid)
Navigate and I will steer
Into the sun, we will run...

Run, whoa whoa whooaa
I will run with you wherever you go 
Don't be afraid 
Let's runaway and I will steer
Into the sun, we will run.
