Roll into town, step off the bus
Shake off the where, you came from dust
Grab you guitar, walk down the street
Sign says Nashville, Tennessee
But I have found

It's a crazy town, full of neon dreams
Everybody plays, everybody sings
Hollywood with a touch of twang
To be a star you gotta bang, bang, bang

Bend those strings till the Hank comes out
Make all the drunk girls scream and shout
We love it, we hate it, we're all just trying to make it
In this crazy town

Pay your dues and you play for free
And you pray for a honky tonk destiny
You cut your teeth in the smokey bars
And live off the tips from a pickle jar
'Til find a cool new sound and you smile
When the record man shoots you down

It's a crazy town, full of neon dreams
Everybody plays, everybody sings
Hollywood with a touch of twang
To be a star you gotta bang, bang, bang

Bend those strings till the hank comes out
Make all the drunk girls scream and shout
We love it, we hate it, we're all just trying to make it
In this crazy town

One year they repossess your Truck
And the next you make a couple million bucks

It's a crazy town full of neon dreams
Everybody plays, everybody sings
Hollywood with a touch of twang
To be a star you gotta

Bend those strings till the hank comes out
Make all the drunk girls scream and shout
We love it, we hate it, we're all just trying to make it
We love it, we hate it, we all came here to make it
In this crazy town, it's a crazy town
