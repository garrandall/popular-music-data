We never talked about it
But I hear the blame was mine
I'd call you up to say I'm sorry
But I wouldn't want to waste your time

'Cause I love you, but I can't take any more
There's a look I can't describe in your eyes
If we could try, like we tried before
Would you keep on telling me those lies? (Telling me lies)


Do you remember?... (Do you remember?)
Uh, do you remember?... (Do you remember?)


There seemed no way to make up
'Cause it seemed your mind was set
And the way you looked it told me
It's a look I know I'll never forget
You could've come over to my side
You could've let me know
You could've tried to see the distance between us
But it seemed too far for you to go


Do you remember?... (Do you remember?)
Uh, do you remember?... (Do you remember?)


Through all of my life
In spite of all the pain
You know people are funny sometimes
'Cause they just can't wait
To get hurt again


Tell me, do you remember?... (Do you remember?)


There are things we won't recall
And feelings we'll never find
It's taken so long to see it
'Cause we never seemed to have the time

There was always something more important to do
More important to say
But "I love you" wasn't one of those things
And now it's too late


Do you remember?... (Do you remember? Now it's over. Do you remember? Uh, it's over)
Uh, do you remember?... (Do you remember? Now it's over. Do you remember? Uh, it's over)
Uh, yeah
Tell me, do you rememeber?... (Do you remember? Now it's over)
Do you remember? (Do you remember? Uh, it's over)
Tell me now, tell me now (Do you remember? Now it's over)
Tell me now, tell me now (Do you remember? Uh, it's over)
Do you remember?...
