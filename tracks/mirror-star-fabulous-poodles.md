He was a lonely boy
No good at sports
He couldn't run
His legs were short
He walked the streets inside his head
And spent a lot of time in bed

He practiced on his way to school
His friends all said
You're off the wall
He played a tight elastic band
His mic was just his empty hand

Mirror, mirror
Mirror star
He posed in front of every car
They all called him crazy kid
He ran up to his room and hid

He greased his hair with Vaseline
And practiced looking really mean
He saw a face that's going far
He posed right there with his guitar

Head's in the clouds on school reports
He's always lost in other thoughts
Made no difference
Shut them out
He'd be a star someday, no doubt

Mirror, mirror
Mirror star
He posed in front of every car
They all called him crazy kid
He ran up to his room and hid

Mirror, mirror on the wall
You never treat him like a fool
Here in his room
He is the king
The wild applause is deafening

You see his face on every wall
From Camden Town to Liverpool
He lays a groupie when he's down
And rents the best hotel in town

The kids hang round to see his face
And wish that they were in his place
Reflections paid
The mirror made
'Cause posing's helped him make the grade

Mirror, mirror
Mirror star
He posed in front of every car
They all called him crazy kid
He ran up to his room and hid

Mirror, mirror on the wall
You never treat him like a fool
Here in his room, he is the king
The wild applause is deafening

Mirror, mirror, mirror star
Mirror star
Mirror, mirror star
Mirror, mirror, mirror star
Mirror, mirror star
Mirror, mirror
