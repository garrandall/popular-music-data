You're talking 'bout women like they're sweet candy for your arm
Braggin' 'bout your new tattoo and how you play guitar
Well you think you're bad when you drink that Coke with a splash of Jack
You're standing at the bar, dropping your daddy's money
Blowing neon smoke and calling all the ladies honey
Well you ain't all that in your 2X truck stop cowboy hat

You got a long long way to go to be an outlaw
Yea, I know your soul by heart and let me tell you hoss
You can play a black hat, rebel roll, rambling man
But this good hearted woman ain't your one night stand
You love your small town, knock down, bad boy reputation
But you're a long long way, long long way from Waylon

You think you walk that line, but your country's watered down
You couldn't last one night with the girls I hang around
You ain't that tough, you're just a wanna be old school that never was

You got a long long way to go to be an outlaw
Yea, I know your soul by heart and let me tell you hoss
You can play a black hat, rebel roll, rambling man
But this good hearted woman ain't your one night stand
You love your small town, knock down, bad boy reputation
I bet Willie would say, you're a long long way from Waylon

You can play a black hat, rebel roll, rambling man
But this good hearted woman ain't your one night stand
You love your small town, knock down, bad boy reputation
But you're a long long way, long long way from Waylon
Oooh, you're a long long long way
Way from Waylon, oh yeah
Oooh, way from Waylon
Way from Waylon
