Yeah, yeah
Yeah
For so long, I think I went blind (Yeah, yeah)
Give me butterflies every time
Of the tunnel so I need to shine (Yeah, yeah)
To my mind teach me how to fly (Yeah)

I've been in my bag for so long I think I went blind (Yeah)
Balling at the mall give me butterflies every time (Yeah)
Lights at the end of the tunnel so I need to shine (Yeah, yeah)
Butterfly doors to my mind teach me how to fly (Yeah, yeah)
I've been in my bag for so long I think I went blind (Yeah)
Balling at the mall give me butterflies every time (Yeah, yeah)
Lights at the end of the tunnel so I need to shine (Yeah)
Butterfly doors to my mind teach me how to fly (Yeah)

Life is a roller coaster, are you down to ride? (Yeah)
Can't tiptoe, gotta run to the other side (Yeah)
We just hanging out but we fly so we hang glide (Yeah, yeah)
You gon' see me on TV so I can't hide (Yeah, yeah)
We might dip out to a different dimension
My name is just too, too hard to mention (Yeah, yeah)
Life can be weird, but hold on to your questions (Yeah, yeah)
You gon' get the answers, for now, ball like Iverson

Land on the water like a dragonfly
Car doors butterfly
Young boy out of line
Doors close, now he's out of sight

I've been in my bag for so long I think I went blind (Yeah)
Balling at the mall give me butterflies every time (Yeah)
Lights at the end of the tunnel so I need to shine (Yeah, yeah)
Butterfly doors to my mind teach me how to fly (Yeah, yeah)
I've been in my bag for so long I think I went blind (Yeah)
Balling at the mall give me butterflies every time (Yeah, yeah)
Lights at the end of the tunnel so I need to shine (Yeah)
Butterfly doors to my mind teach me how to fly (Yeah)

Butterfly doors to my heart, but you need a key (Yeah)
Swerving in some foreign, push start, don't need no key (Yeah)
Fly like an insect, no, caterpillar, centipede (Yeah, yeah)
Stacking money sideways, money long energy (Yeah, yeah)
Underwater so much, think I can water breathe (Yeah)
Walls caving in in the dark, I can hardly breathe (Yeah, yeah)
Hope I glow quick in the dark, I can hardly see (Yeah)
I know it  quick, burn these demons that are holding me

Land on the water like a dragonfly
Car doors butterfly
Young boy out of line
Doors close, now he's out of sight

I've been in my bag for so long I think I went blind (Yeah)
Balling at the mall give me butterflies every time (Yeah)
Lights at the end of the tunnel so I need to shine (Yeah, yeah)
Butterfly doors to my mind teach me how to fly (Yeah, yeah)
I've been in my bag for so long I think I went blind (Yeah)
Balling at the mall give me butterflies every time (Yeah, yeah)
Lights at the end of the tunnel so I need to shine (Yeah)
Butterfly doors to my mind teach me how to fly (Yeah)
