Me and Martha took a honeymoon
Below the border 'neath the silvery moon
She was eighteen and I was twenty-two
Now we're just a-doin' what the young folks do

We're goin' south (South)
To get that Acapulco gold
Ain't nothin' it can't fix (Can't fix)
Old dogs can learn new tricks (New tricks)
When the streets are lined with bricks
Of Acapulco gold

We 'bout decided against the whole thing
But then we thought that we ought to swing
Thinkin' that the southland held the keys
To cure these cotton-pickin' sniffles and sneeze

We're goin' south (South)
To get that Acapulco gold
Ain't nothin' it can't fix (Can't fix)
Old dogs can learn new tricks (New tricks)
When the streets are lined with bricks
Of Acapulco gold

Zig zag polly wolly diddum woddum doo
Hey diddle diddle, twenty-three-skiddo
Me and Martha sure had fun
Acapulco gold for everyone

We're goin' south (South)
To get that Acapulco gold
Ain't nothin' it can't fix (Can't fix)
Old dogs can learn new tricks (New tricks)
When the streets are lined with bricks
Of Acapulco gold

??? even a matchbox, five cents
