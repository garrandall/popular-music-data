Let's, excuse me, baby
Go, yeah you, baby
Back, oh you groovy, baby
In, let's make a movie, baby
Time, excuse me, baby
Let's, yeah you, baby
Go, oh you groovy, baby
Back in, let's make a movie, baby
Time


It's Mr Worldwide, Agent A, reporting live
From Cape Canaveral, MK, Big Syphe, let's ride
Back, back, in, in, time


Baby
Ohhh, baby
Ohhh, baby
My sweet baby
You're the one


Miami equals
Black mask, black clothes
With a little bit of rope to tie, I flipped it
Black suits, white shirts, black glasses with a matching tie
Like Agent J or Agent K, and I wish the whole world would
Ok, I'm tryin' make a billion out of 15 cents
Understand, understood
I'm a go-getter, mover, shaker, culture
Bury a boarder, record-breaker, won't cha
Give credit where credit is due, don't cha
Know that I don't give a number two
Y'all just halfway thoughts
Not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future
We have to go back in time


Baby
Ohhh, baby
Ohhh, baby
My sweet baby
You're the one


I got the globe, yeah, in the palm of my hand
Wherever I spin it, that's where I land
Let's save the world
Men In Black, I know you understand
Stop the movement, they can try if they want to
Ignorar lo latino, si, they can try if they want to
What Pit solves is a bit raw
Took like jigsaw and built it all
Despite a big loss, I'd bet it all
And fought blind against the world, Ray Charles
Y'all just halfway thoughts
Not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future
We have to go back in time


Baby
Ohhh, baby
Ohhh, baby
My sweet baby
You're the one


Let's, excuse me, baby
Go, yeah, you, baby
Back, oh you groovy, baby
In, let's make a movie, baby
Time, excuse me, baby
Let's, yeah you, baby
Go, oh you groovy, baby
Back in, let's make a movie, baby
Time


Baby
My sweet baby
My sweet baby
My sweet baby
You're the...
Baby
Ohhh, baby
Ohhh, baby
My sweet baby
You're the one
