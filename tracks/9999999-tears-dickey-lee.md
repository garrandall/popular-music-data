The sun didn't shine this morning
It's been raining the whole day through
Suddenly without warning
You found somebody new
That's when the first tear came
Falling from my eyes
I'm beginning to feel the pain
Seeing nothing but clouds in the sky

Got 9, 999, 999 tears to go
And then I don't know if I'll be over you
When I be over you

You're out tonight with your new love
I'm far far from your mind
Trying to get over your new love
Could take a whole lifetime
I can't believe you could want anybody else
So no one could take my place
At least that's what I've been telling myself
As the tears fall down my face
