Who was it that caught falling
And put you back on your feet

And who was it that tripped anyway
In order that the two of us would meet
It was me and I tell you why
Oh I did because of my pure unabashed devotion to loving you
Do de do do de dodo
Do de do do de dodo
Who was it that tried to kiss you
Despite a very definite no
And who was it that managed to succeed
In getting it with your fists down below
It was me and I tell you why oh I did it
Because of my pure unabashed devotion to loving you
You and me both look the feel same we even look alike and like it's
Blooming shame that because we do
People think where you know what I mean

Who was it that came to see you when there was no one ells insight
And who was it that stayed over an
Hour and not as I expected over night

It was me and I tell you why oh I did it
Because of my pure unabashed devotion to loving you
It was me and I tell you why oh I did it because of
My pure unabashed devotion to loving pure unabashed
To loving you you you you you you
