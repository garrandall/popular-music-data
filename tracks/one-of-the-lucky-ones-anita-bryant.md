Who has a love as great as yours
When others may have none
I thank my luck stars above
I'm one of the lucky ones

When you are there
To hold me close
When wearied days are done
I tell myself a thousand times
I'm one of the lucky ones

You are the only reason why
My hopes run higher than the sky
There's nothing in this world to fear
When you are near
So very near

And when I hear you say you're mine
My every dream comes true
For with each kiss
You tell me this
You're one of the lucky ones too
You're one of the lucky ones too
