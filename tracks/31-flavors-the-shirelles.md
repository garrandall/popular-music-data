Got a baby who
Can kiss in thirty-one flavors (and we like tutti-frutti best)
I call him ice cream Joe
He is the most delicious boy I know
Every time his tasty lips are kissing mine
He gives me thirty-one flavors (and we like tutti-frutti best)

I just love him so
He's my confectionary ice cream Joe
Every time I kiss him I feel mighty fine
I love his thirty-one flavors (and we like tutti-frutti best)

Pineapple peach
Coconut and banana
Some other eats
Chocolate too
I'm telling you that when we kiss
He gives me thirty-one flavors (and we like tutti-frutti best)

I want the world to know
How much I love my little ice cream Joe
Every time I kiss him I feel mighty fine
I love his thirty-one flavors (and we like tutti-frutti best)

Pineapple peach
Coconut and banana
Some other eats
Chocolate too
I'm telling you that when we kiss
He gives me thirty-one flavors (and we like tutti-frutti best)

I want the world to know
How much I love my little ice cream Joe
Every time I kiss him I feel mighty fine
I love his thirty-one flavors

Peach, banana, coconut too
Oh no they won't do
I think
