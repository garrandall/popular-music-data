Moving Moving Move away
Spirit changed the conversation
Stepping stones across the land
I never wanted to be a hero
I never wanted to be a man
I hurt you darling
I made you cry
I hurt you darling
Don't ask me why
Move move move away from me darling
I never said I'd hold your hand
Move move move away from me darling
I never said I'd understand
If I could say this was judgement day
You know I'd be a millionaire
I'm prepared to wear my sorrow
Everywhere we go in town
Ain't no need to beg or borrow
While you're there to drag me down
(Justice right)
I need you so
I can't let go
I never said I'd hold your hand
Why don't you move?
