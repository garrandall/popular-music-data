I hear a poet say
How love will find its way
For soon the eyes can't hide
Feelings so deep inside
But sittin' here with you
I'm coming all unglued
For sure as I approach the fact
You're in my arms
Its time to act, I turn to you
Then I lose control
My eyes get blurry then the tears come down
I try to tell you but I don't know how
To get the words out and say somehow I love you so
Darling take a look
My heart's an open book
Just read in between the lines
It's sayin' please be mine
Yeah see this feeling through
Please help me see it through
Help me climb the mountain, babe
I'll reach the top, I'll have it made
I'll say the things my heart wants to reveal
My eyes get blurry then the tears come down
I try to tell you but I don't know how
To get the words and say somehow I love you so
(I love you so)
Help me climb the mountain,babe
I'll reach the top, i'll have it made
I'll say the things my heart wants to reveal
My eyes get blurry
Then the tears come down
I try to tell you but I don't know how
To get the words and say somehow
I love you so
(I love you so)
Each night I pray the words to come out
From my heart I give the world to you, my love
To you, just to you
Cause I want you I need you, I love you my baby
Don't you know
(My eyes get blurry, then the tears come down)
