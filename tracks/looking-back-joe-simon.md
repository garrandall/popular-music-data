Looking back over my life
I can see where
I caused you strife
But I know, oh, yes, I know
I'd never make that
Same mistake again

Looking back over my deeds
I can see signs
A wise man heeds
And if I just had the chance, believe
I'd never make that
Same mistake again

Once, my cup was overflowing
But I gave nothing in return
Now I can't begin to tell you
What a lesson, what a lesson I have learned
Looking back over the slate
I can see love turned to hate
But I know, oh, yes, I know, believe
Honey I'd never make that
Same mistake again
