If you need me, call my name
I'll come a runnin' like a choo-choo train
I'll always love you, always feel the same

You told me a lie
You made, made me cry
I'll always love you till the day I die

I'm goin' far away and I'm goin', goin' to stay
If you don't see me no more
Meet me on your Monday

But if you need me, call my name
I'll come a runnin' like a choo-choo train
'Cause I'll always love you, always feel the same
