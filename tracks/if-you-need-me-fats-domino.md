Take every leaf from every tree.
Take every blade of grass you see.
Take every stone you think you'll need.
They're yours to keep,
My love.

And if the days don't treat you right,
Take out the sun and make it night.
Whatever suits your appetite,
Take a bite,
My love.

'Cause I'm not standing on your toes,
My love.
You can have everything except my rock n' roll,
My love.
Put down Fats Domino.

I've done my best to give you love.
I understand that ain't enough.
You know that I won't need the stuff
So use it up,
My love.

No, I'm not standing on your toes,
My love.
You can take everything except my rock n' roll,
My love.
Put down Fats Domino.

I know that I'll miss you,
And I hate to see you leave,
But I can't let you walk out that door, baby,
With my LP's.

No, I'm not standing on your toes,
My love.
You can have everything you want except my rock n' roll,
My love.
No, I'm not standing on your toes,
My love.
