bracelet,we'll be sippin' moet wit strawberries and dat shit, I'm nasty ask me
why I lick my lips so in the darkness I can run my tongue over your tits
its all good sugary,u aint leavin' sit up on my face and help my stash grow

map
i put away the gat,took off the hat,throw ya mo's in the air if u like it like
that

whatever's clever I got endless cash,trees from Hawaii, 2 pools or baths


i'll be loungin with LL Cool J
i'll be loungin' with LL,hey hey

uh,my scenario is grand,a dime peice,hennessey up in my hand
i turn out the lights like teddy,im feenin', standin' in the darkness,now im
ready
uhh,oh yeah up in ya,let it flow while I pump slow,then I speed it up,heat it
up
make it mo' tasty,so u can swing low and lace me
use your imagination,u do me,i do u,sex education

the rooftops
i'm 'bout to spank u on dat ass(oh) I know u love it when it lasts(true) when
u need it who u ask (you) what u sayin' when I dash (don't go boo)



u got to bounce wit me suga,word up,u got to bounce wit me suga,worda
worda,word up...

warm it up suga,make it hot,shorties'll swarm,make me wanna bust shots,we
speak daily on the regular,run your jibs all day chip in my cellular
shoot down to jamaica,pretty white sand,suntan oil,pina' coladas in my hand
layin up at night,peepin' at stars,remember,when we was at the club in da
bars?
i told ya my status was that of a don,u thought I was a dog and u aint wanna
get it on,but my mind has attractin' qualities,all the emotions of a young
lady
so here u are,smack dab up in the mix,shorty this here's about as good as it
gets
word up,i'ma treat u like a queen from the heart,crack the bubbly,and let the
episode start.
