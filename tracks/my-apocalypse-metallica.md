Claustrophobic
Crawl out of this skin
Hard explosive
Reach in, pull that pin


Feel thy name, extermination
Desecrate, inhale the fire


So we cross that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse


Deadly vision
Prophecy reveal
Death magnetic
Pulling closer still


Fear thy name, annihilation
Desolate, inhale the fire


So we cross that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse
My apocalypse

Go


Crushing metal, ripping skin
Tossing body mannequin
Spilling blood, bleeding gas
Mangle flesh, snapping spine
Dripping bloody valentine
Shattered face, spitting glass
Split apart
Split apart
Split apart
Split
Spit it out!


What makes me drift a little bit closer?
Dead man takes the steering wheel
What makes me know it's time to cross over?
Worn to repeat until I feel

See through the skin the bones they all rattle
Future and past they disagree
Flesh falls away the bones they all shatter
I start to see the end in me
See the end in me


Claustrophobic
Climb out of this skin
Hard explosive
Reach in, pull that pin

Violate, annihilate
Wounds unto my eyes
Obliterate, exterminate
Life itself denied


Fear thy name as hell awakens
Destiny, inhale the fire


But we've crossed that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse


Tyrant awaken my apocalypse
Demon awaken my apocalypse
Heaven awaken my apocalypse
Suffer forever my apocalypse
