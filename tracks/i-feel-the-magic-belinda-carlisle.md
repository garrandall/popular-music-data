Last night I gave up on myself
I hit the bed, tell me what should I do
And in a dream I saw your face

It's more than just a face
You make me want to give my heart away
I feel the magic
Like I never felt before
I imagine that it's always been there
I feel the magic
There's an angel looking after me
Angel baby give me more and more

Today I woke up by myself
I hit the streets I wondered what should I do
I never noticed from the start
That I could feel alive again
That I could feel a part of
I feel the magic
Like I never felt before
I imagine that it's always been there
I feel the magic
There's an angel looking after me
Angel baby give me more and more
