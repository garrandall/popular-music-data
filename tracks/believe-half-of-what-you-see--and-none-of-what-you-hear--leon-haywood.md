I'm ready
I'm ready now

Don't push it
Don't force it

Let it happen naturally

It will surely happen

If it was menat to be
Don't push it
Don't force it

Let it happen naturally

It will surely happen

If love was meant to be

Patience isn't my best virtue

When I'm in the mood for love

I can't controll my passion

I wanna love you all over

Don't push it
Don't force it
...

My nature is high inside

I'm burning about to lose self control

I can't fight this feeling

My love is much to hot to hold

Don't push it
Don't force it
...

If it was really meant to be

Don't push it

It will happen naturally

Don't force it

What will be will surely be

Don't push it

If love was meant for you and me

Don't force it

Don't push it
Don't force it
...

You're the spark
That lights my fire

You set me off to a full alarm

I can't stand anticipation

I'm in the mood to get it on

Don't push it
Don't force it
