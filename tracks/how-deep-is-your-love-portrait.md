I assure I am real
You're thinking
How could that be?
And could a man
Be so serene?
Such a vision of power?

Well, my dear
It's plain to see
I am a man
With everything
As the flowers
Bow to me
And they behold their lord

Whatever you want
Consider it done, baby
Everything, your deepest desires
For I am the man

Whatever you want
Consider it done
I'll be there
Tell me all your deepest desires
For I am the man

From the time
I was conceived
I would become
The greatest king
Bring the people
To their knees
Shower them with love

The mystics have forseen
I realize the prophecy
Deliver this world
From the enemy
Unify a soul as one

Whatever you want
Consider it done, baby
Everything, your deepest desires
For I am the man

Whatever you want
Consider it done
I'll be there
Tell me all your deepest desires
For I am the man

To me, it's all a game
Committed in my name
My currency of pain
I cast the world into the flames

It's not easy to be me
Got a lot of responsibilities
And such popularity
I feel like I could cry

I give it all and they can see
I am a brilliant entity
Emitting glorious energy
By the grace of gods, go I

Whatever you want
Consider it done, baby
Everything, your deepest desires
For I am the man

Whatever you want
Consider it done
I'll be there
Tell me all your deepest desires
For I am the man

To me, it's all a game
Committed in my name
My currency of pain
I cast the world into the flames

You know I love to, love to
Love to be me, baby
I think you'd love to love me
You know, baby, yeah

Whatever you want
Consider it done, baby
Everything, your deepest desires
For I am the man

Whatever you want
Consider it done
I'll be there
Tell me all your deepest desires
For I am the man

Whatever you want
Consider it done, baby
Everything, your deepest desires
For I am the man

Whatever you want
Consider it done
I'll be there
Tell me all your deepest desires
For I am the man
