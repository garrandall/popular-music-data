No, ohh
No no no
You know there's two sides to every story

See I don't know why
You're crying like a bitch
Talkin' shit like a snitch
Why'd you write a song bout me
If you didn't really care
You wouldn't wanna share
Tellin' everybody just how you feel

Fuck what I did, was your fault some how
Fuck the presents, I threw all that shit out
Fuck off that cryin', it didn't mean jack
Well guess what yo
Fuck you right back

Fuck what I did, was your fault some how
Fuck the presents, I threw all that shit out
Fuck off that cryin', it didn't mean jack
Well guess what yo
Fuck you right back

You thought you could really make me moan
I had better sex, all alone
I had to, to do your friend
Now you want me to come back
You must be smokin' crack
I'm goin' else where and thats for fact

Fuck all those nights I moaned real loud
Fuck it I faked it, aren't you proud
Fuck all those nights you thought
You broke my back
Well guess what yo
Your sex was wack

Fuck all those nights I moaned real loud
Fuck it I faked it, aren't you proud
Fuck all those nights you thought
You broke my back
Well guess what yo
Your sex was wack

Ooh ooh oh oh yeah
Ooh ooh oh oh yeah
Ooh ooh oh oh yeah
Ooh ooh oh oh yeah

You question did I care
Maybe I would have
If you would it gone down me
Now it's over
But I do admit I'm glad
I didn't catch your crabs
I can't sweat that 'cause I bout to go

Fuck what I did, was your fault some how
Fuck the presents, I threw all that shit out
Fuck off that cryin', it didn't mean jack
Well guess what yo
Fuck you right back

Ooh ooh oh oh yeah
Ooh ooh oh oh yeah
Ooh ooh oh oh yeah
Ooh ooh oh oh yeah

You made me do this
