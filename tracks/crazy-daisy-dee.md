Crazy, I'm crazy for you, for you
Nothin' in this world that I wouldn't do
My thoughts get so lazy
My mind gets so hazy
I'm crazy, so crazy for you, for you

Changin', I'm changin' for you, for you
Nothin' in this world that I wouldn't do
My heart gets so lazy
My eyes get so hazy
I'm changin', I'm changin' for you, for you

But now I'm gonna sing it to you

Daisy Dew
I wanna do just like them old songs do
So take my hand and let me twirl you around the moon
I wanna fall in love with Daisy Dew
I wanna do this like them old folks do
So take my hand and let me twirl you around the moon
I wanna fall in love with you

Aches in my, aches in my bones, bones, bones
Nowhere in this world, I'm takin' it slow
My heart gets so lazy
My eyes get so hazy
Got aches in my, aches in my bones

Got shakes in my, shakes in my toes, toes, toes
Nowhere in this world, I'm takin' it slow
My thoughts get so lazy
My mind gets so hazy
Got shakes in my, shakes in my toes, toes

Now I'll do my best to take it slow

Daisy Dew
I wanna do just like them old songs do
So take my hand and let me twirl you around the moon
I wanna fall in love with Daisy Dew
I wanna do this like them old folks do
So take my hand and let me twirl you around the moon
I wanna fall in love with you

Daisy Dew
I wanna do just like them old songs do
So take my hand and let me fly you around the moon
I wanna fall in love with Daisy Dew
I wanna do this like them old folks do
So take my hand and let me fly you around the moon
I wanna fall in love with you

I wanna shooba-dee-doo, doo
Just like them old songs do
So take my hand and let me twirl you around the moon
I wanna do just like them old songs do
Daisy Dew, I wanna do just like we do
