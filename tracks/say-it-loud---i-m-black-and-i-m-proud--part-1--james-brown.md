Uh! With your bad self!


Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!
Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!


Some people say we've got a lot of malice
Some say it's a lot of nerve
But I say we won't quit moving until we get what we deserve
We have been 'buked and we have been scorned
We've been treated bad, talked about as sure as you're born
But just as sure as it takes two eyes to make a pair, ha
Brother we can't quit until we get our share


Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!
Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!


I worked on jobs with my feet and my hands
But all the work I did was for the other man
Now we demand a chance to do things for ourselves
We're tired of beating our head against the wall
And working for someone else


Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!
Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!


Oh-wee, give it to me
All right, you're out of sight
All night, so tough
You're tough and rough
Oh-wee, uh, you're killing me


Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!
Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!


We demand a chance to do things for ourselves
We're tired of beating our head against the wall
And working for someone else


We're people, we like the birds and the bees
We'd rather die on our feet
Than be living on our knees


Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!
Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!


All right now, good God
You know we can do the boogaloo
Now we can say with the funky talk, and we do
Sometimes we sing and we talk
You know we jump back and do the camel walk
All right now, all right
All right


Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!
Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!


We demand a chance to do things for ourselves
We're tired of beating our head against the wall
And working for someone else


We're people, we like the birds and the bees
We'd rather die on our feet
Than be living on our knees


Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!
Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!


Oh-wee, you're killing me
All right, you're out of sight
All right, you're out of sight
Oh-wee, ah
Oh-wee, you're killing me
Oh-wee


Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!
Say it loud: I'm black and I'm proud!
