Girl, you know we belong together
I don't have no time for you to be playing
With my heart like this
You'll be mine forever baby, you just wait

We belong together
And you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart?
Why do you play with my mind?

Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me
And never say goodbye?

When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try I just break down and cry
Pain in my head, oh, I'd rather be dead
Spinning around and around

Although we've come
To the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you

Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you

Girl, I know you really love me
You just don't realize
You've never been there before
It's only your first time

Maybe I'll forgive you
Maybe you'll try
We should be happy together
Forever, you and I

Will you love me again like you loved me before?
This time I want you to love me much more
This time instead just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me go

Although we've come
To the end of the road (End of the road)
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you

Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you

Girl I'm here for you
All those times of night when you just hurt me
And just run out with that other fella
Baby I knew about it, I just didn't care
You just don't understand how much I love you do you?
I'm here for you

I'm not out to go out on cheat you (Maybe I'll forgive you)
Just like you did baby but that's alright
Hey, I love you anyway (Maybe you will try)
And I'm still gonna be here for you 'til my dying day baby
Right now, I'm just in so much pain baby (We should be happy together forever)
'Cause you just won't come back to me (You and I)
Will you? Just come back to me

(Lonely)
Yes, baby, my heart is lonely (Lonely)
My heart hurts baby (Lonely)
Yes, I feel pain too (Lonely)
Baby please

This time instead just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me go

Although we've come
To the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you

Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you

Although we've come
To the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural (It's unnatural)
You belong to me (You belong to me)
I belong to you

Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let you go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you
