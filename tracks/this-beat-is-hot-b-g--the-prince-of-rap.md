Like 007 I'm on a mission
Makin' people dance, droppin' suckas who dissin'
Keep the crowd movin' 'cause the beat is kinda soothin' yo the ear
Yo', I give you what you wanna hear
I could make you dance and make you shout
'Cause I'm all about the M-O-N-E-Y, without a doubt
And I won't stop until I make you rock
So understand that I can make you dance, dance, dance, dance

The beat is on, you know it's hittin'
Get on the floor, don't wanna see nobody sittin'
'Cause I go in slow when I'm on the mic
Make you dance and do what you like
It's a simple calculation like one and one is two
I don't do this all for me, I do it all for you
And I won't stop until I make you rock
So understand that I can make you dance

Get up, get into the rhythm
Get, get, get into the rhythm
Get up, get into the rhythm
Make up your mind

Get up, get into the rhythm
Get, get, get into the rhythm
Get up, get into the rhythm
Make up your mind

I'm a part of the force, of course my lyrics runnin' like a race horse
Strong and fast, don't try to pass, got no way, you'll never last
With the speed I'm usin', teller fresh rhymes is what I'm movin'
To be raw, like you never saw, music up to par
And I won't stop until I make you rock
So understand that I can make you dance, dance, dance

I'm a rappin' educator, bustin' rhyme devastator
Like a clock likes to tock, bust a rap and a rock
From the day to the night, that's a rhyme I do recite
And I know you had no clue when I say what I do
So I slow down just a bit
To give enough time to let you hit the cigarette
And I won't stop until I make you rock
So understand that I can make you dance

Get up, get into the rhythm
Get, get, get into the rhythm
Get up, get into the rhythm
Make up your mind
