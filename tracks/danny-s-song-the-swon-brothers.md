People smile and tell me I'm the lucky one
And we've just begun
Think I'm gonna have a son
He will be like she and me, free as a dove
Conceived in love
The sun is gonna shine above

And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you honey
And everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning, when I rise
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright

Seems as though, a month ago, I was Beta-Chi
Never got high
And oh I was a sorry guy
And now I smile and face a girl that shares my name
Now I'm through with the game
This boy will never be the same

And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you honey
And everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning, when I rise
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything, is gonna be alright

Love a girl who holds the world in a paper cup
And drink it up
Love her and she'll bring you luck
And if you find she helps your mind, buddy take her home
Oh don't you live alone
Try to earn what lovers own

And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you honey
And everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning, when I rise
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright

Even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you, honey
And everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning, when I rise
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
