Meet me at midnight, Mary
Same place we always go –
Meet me at midnight, Mary
And don't let anyone know!
Don't let anyone know!

Your Daddy says, I'm a bad boy
And youve no future with me
So we can only get together
By meeting secretly!

Meet me at midnight, Mary
Same place we always go –
Meet me at midnight, Mary
And don't let anyone know!
Don't let anyone know!

Just got a job on the railroad
The work is hard and long
But I'm gonna build us a future
And show your Daddy he's wrong!

Meet me at midnight, Mary
Same place we always go –
Meet me at midnight, Mary
And don't let anyone know!
Don't let anyone know!

Soon as I have some money
For a home and everything
We won't have to keep it a secret
That youve got my wedding ring!

Meet me at midnight, Mary
Same place we always go –
Meet me at midnight, Mary
And don't let anyone know!
Don't let anyone know!
Don't let anyone kno-o-ow!
