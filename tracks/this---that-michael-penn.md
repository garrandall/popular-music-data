Well you cut me to the quick
With some kind of abandon
And I'm pouring over every word in my mind
And it isn't making sense
'cause it's coming back at random
And I already forgot what I expected to find
So maybe it's the wrong game
I shut down the replay
Maybe it's a case of hardness of heart
But I'm down for the count
And there's got to be someway
To clear out whatever keeps us apart
I'll do this
And I'll do that
I'll be burning canyons for you
I'll do this
And I'll do that
And I will wait forever if you'll be there
Now I haven't got a chance
If there's no silver lining
I'm far past the point of doing what's right
I can still strike the match
That'll start the mountains shining
There might be something new in that light
I'll do this
And I'll do that
I'll be burning canyons for you
I'll do this
And I'll do that
But I can't wait 'till heaven
I won't be there...
