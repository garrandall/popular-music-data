The love of a boy
Can change a girl
Into a woman
(Woman, a woman)

I know that it's true
(Know that it's true)
My love for you
(My love for you)
Made me a woman

Once I was only a girl
Young and afraid
You came to me
And you gave me love

What a difference you made
The love of a boy
(Love of a boy)
Can change a girl
(Can change a girl)
Into a woman
(Woman, a woman)

With just one caress
(Just one caress)
Your tenderness
(Your tenderness)
Made me a woman
Made me a woman

You are faithful and true
Love burning deep in my heart and soul
And it's only for you, my true true love
