This is the fuckin shit I be talkin about
Half rappin' ass mothafuckers
You think it's a game? You think it's a fuckin GAME?
Come on, uh, uh, uh
Come on, uh, uh...
What'cha really want
What'cha really want, what
D-M-X, uh, uh...
Come on, Ryde or die
Aiyo, aiyo, aiyo


What's my name?
DMX and I be the best, you see the rest they looking like they need a rest
One more time
I'ma spit at you some shit that's gon get at you be fuckin with your mind
Stop talkin shit
'Cause you out there runnin' your mouth and really don't know who you fuckin with
Here we go again
How many times do I have to tell you rap niggas I have no friends?
You still actin up
Runnin around here like some brand new pussy that's about to get fucked
The game don't stop
I'm still gettin down for whatever whenever that's why my shit is hot
Can't keep it real
Now, some of us do but most of us don't that's just how a nigga feel
I shed blood for my people
That'll keep you lookin see-through whenever you try to creep through


D-M-X, If you want it we got it
Come and get it nigga we wit it, all you gotta do is set it baby
Ryde or die
What ya niggas want, uh, uh, what ya niggas want


You still playin games
You gon' think it's a joke until they no longer remember your name
That's how we do 'em
Make cowards disappear into thin air by puttin shit through 'em
Never comin' back
Last time you saw that nigga is the last time you'll see that nigga
No more deaths
'Cause in a minute you gonna have grandma bein the only family member left
Bust my gun
If I gots to kill a nigga but I'm always down for the one on one
Dog for life
We gon get to the bottom of this shit if it takes all night
Stop drop, open up shop
Fake up-north niggas screamin' for the cops
Ryde or die
What that mean is that a tell a nigga bye-bye and pop him in his right eye


D-M-X, If you want it we got it
Come and get it nigga we wit it, all you gotta do is set it baby
Ryde or die
What ya niggas want, uh, uh, what ya niggas want


Look at all these off brand niggas
Runnin' around yappin' about they be holdin figures as big as Jigga's
That's that bullshit
Hope they know that around me talkin' about what you got will get you hit
I'm not a nice person
I mean I'd smack the shit out you twice dog and that's before I start cursin'
I stay flippin'
One minute I'm cool, the next minute I'm up on a nigga, rippin'
That's my style
I'm a cruddy nigga leave you all bloody nigga, service with a smile
Suck my dick
And while you niggas that's been to jail before know it's about to get thick
Let's get it on baby
You gonna be goin' against 4 niggas at once and you think I'm crazy?
I've lost my mind
And I'm about to make you lose yours too from far away one time


D-M-X, If you want it we got it
Come and get it nigga we wit it, all you gotta do is set it baby
Ryde or die
What ya niggas want, uh, uh, what ya niggas want

D-M-X!
