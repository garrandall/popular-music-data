Betty in Bermudas
Goes walking by
Like a movie star
With her head up high

(CHORUS)
Hey, Betty (hey, Betty)
Yeah, Betty (yeah, Betty)
Betty in Bermudas
I dig your dimpled knee

Betty's face is pretty
Everybody say
But she's still in shorts
I'm gonna look that way

(CHORUS)

Aw, come on, baby

I squawk when I hear her talk
I fly when she wiggles by
I scream when I see that dream
I die, I die when she says goodbye

Betty in Bermudas
Yeah, she looks so fine
And I'm so happy
In the summer time

(CHORUS)

Oh, come on, play on

Betty in Bermudas
Goes walking by
Like a movie star
With her head up high

(CHORUS)

I fly when she walks on by
I flip when I watch her dip
I sing when she shakes that thing

Betty in Bermudas
Never wears a dress
Ah, but she's the winner
Of my beauty contest

(CHORUS)

Come on, honey
Just one more time now
Betty in Bermudas
I dig your dimpled knee
