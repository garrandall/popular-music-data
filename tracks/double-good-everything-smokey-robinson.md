It's paradise, paradise
It's ecstasy, ecstasy
It's awful nice, awful nice
Having you loving me
It's wonderful, wonderful
It's very true, very true
It's double good everything
Being loved by you

But what did I do to deserve this
Makes me stop and wonder who am I?
What would make you want to serve this
To just another ordinary guy
Twice as good as any feeling
I have ever known
To call my own

I said, it's paradise, paradise
Well, you know it's ecstasy, ecstasy
It's awful nice, awful nice
Baby, having you loving me
You know that it's wonderful, wonderful
Oh, very true, very true
It's double good everything
Being loved by you

You got an over abundant
Amount of everything I seem to need
You gotta know you're the one
When I just have to follow where you lead
Keep that loving coming to me
Don't let up one bit
Don't ever quit

Because it's paradise, paradise
Oh, ecstasy, ecstasy
It's awful nice, awful nice
Baby, having you loving me
Oh, you know it's wonderful, wonderful
Yeah, very true, very true
It's double good everything
Being loved by you

Well, being loved by you
Being loved by you
Oh, being loved by you
Being loved by you
Being loved by you
Oh, being loved by you
It's double good, double good
(Being loved by you)
Double good, double good
Double good, double good
(Being loved by you)
Double good, being loved by you
Being loved by you
Ah, it's wonderful, wonderful
(Being loved by you)
Oh, ecstasy, ecstasy...
