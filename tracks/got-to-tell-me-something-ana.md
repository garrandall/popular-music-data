My feelings
For you just can't stop
I'm willing
To prove my love to you
So don't let us part


What you say and what you do
Are two different things
Don't say that you love me
And mess up my brain


(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Got to tell me something
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Something, something
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Got to tell me something
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Something, something

First you say you love me
And then you say you don't

(Ha ha ha ha)
Tell me something
(Ha ha ha ha)
Tell me something


When you touch me
The fire begins
And when you kiss me
I want to say I love you
Again and again

I may seem confused
But I just can't stop loving you

(Ha ha ha ha)
Tell me something
(Ha ha ha ha)
Tell me something
(Ha ha ha ha)
Tell me something
(Ha ha ha ha)
Tell me something

Maurice, take it to the bridge

Get ready


(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Got to tell me something
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
You got to tell me something, boy
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Tell me with all your love
