Hey, boy, we're drifting apart
We keep breaking each other's hearts
Tell me how long can this go on
Before all our love is gone?

Tell me now
Can we pick up the pieces?
Can we pick up the pieces?
And start all over
I don't want to lose you now

We can't acting like little children
Playing games that's so unfair
We keep stepping on each other's feelings
When deep down, deep down
We really, really care

Got to pick up the pieces
Got to pick up the pieces
And start all over
Start all over

I know we can make it
This time we can go all the way
'Cause I realized now
The cost of losing you
Is too high a price, oh, for me to pay

Oh, I don't ever wanna lose you now
Oh no

Let's start all over, yeah
Start all over, yeah

Let's pick up the pieces
Let's pick up the pieces
I don't ever, I don't ever
Wanna lose you now

And we're gonna
Yes, we're gonna pick 'em on up

1972 we know just what to do
In 1972 we know just what to do
Gonna pick 'em on up
Gonna pick 'em on up

Yeah, hey, hey
On up
