Hey hey honey when I'm without you
I get a chill up and down my spine
And I, I feel so hot and the pain won't stop
Tearing at this heart of mine
And I wouldn't have it, I know I can say
And I wouldn't have it any other way

Do you like to make love with me or turn it around?
Do you like the way it feels when I hold you tight?
Do you like the way I say I'm coming on home?
I'd get you when I want you then you're on your own

Out of mind out of sight
Gotta keep my body tight
Out of mind out of sight
I'm gonna keep my body tight

Looking a little bit closer now
I've got something to say to you
And if your body touches me, I just don't know what I might do
And so hold me honey, hit on the bed
I got notions in my head

Out of mind out of sight
Gotta keep my body tight
Out of mind out of sight
I'm gonna keep my body tight

Hey hey honey when I'm without you
I get a chill up and down my spine
And I, I feel so hot and the pain won't stop
Tearing at this heart of mine
And I wouldn't have it, I know I can say
And I wouldn't have it any other way

Do you like to make love with me or turn it around?
Do you like the way it feels when I hold you tight?
Do you like the way I say I'm coming on home?
I'd take you when I want you then you're on your own

Out of mind out of sight
Gotta keep my body tight
Out of mind out of sight
Gotta keep my body tight
Out of mind out of sight
Gotta keep my body tight
Out of mind out of sight
Gotta keep my body tight
