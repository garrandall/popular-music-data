You still got that light in your eye
And our day is comin' by and by
I'm travellin' this long road to be with you
We still gotta long way, we still gotta long way to go.

The first time I set eyes on you, and I listened to you sing, yeah yeah
We didn't have to speak cause the words said everything
Yes you walked right into my life, and we were on our way, yeah
So long ago, but it feels like yesterday.

And I just wanna tell you...

You still got that light in your eye (yes you do)
And our day is comin' by and by
I'm travellin' this long road to be with you
We still gotta long way, we still gotta long way to go.

Now some of my best memories are days I spent with you, yeah
Each time we hit the road it was always somethin' new
Spaced out rather drunk
And singin' in the sun, yeah yeah
One more bottle dead and a new day just begun.

I just wanna tell you...

You still got that light in your eye
And our day is comin' by and by
I'm travellin' this long road to be with you
We still gotta long way, we still gotta long way to go.

Shinin' light, shinin' bright on the days gone down
Shinin' light, shinin' bright on the days gone down
Shinin' light, shinin' bright on the days gone down

We won't forget the days gone down, they're written in our hearts, yeah yeah
And we're as much in tune as we were right at the start
It all seems so much harder now, it seemed so easy then, yeah yeah
Well someday just for fun we might do it all again.

I just wanna tell you...

You still got that light in your eye (yes you do)
And our day is comin' by and by
I'm travellin' this long road to be with you
We still gotta long way, we still gotta long way to go.

Yeah yeah still got that light in your eye
And our day is comin' by and by
I'm travellin', travellin' (yeah yeah)
We still gotta long way, we still gotta long way to go.
