When it's cold outside and you want to sleep in
go for a pallet that's so nice and thin.
Zip it on around while it's on the ground,
spread it out and lay it on down.
Slip inside my sleeping bag,
slip inside my sleeping bag.

You're afraid of the dark, baby, no need to be shy.
We'll talk about some lovin' while we look at the sky.
Don't be hesitating, it'll be alright,
we'll tuck it in until it's clean out of sight.
Slip inside my sleeping bag,
slip inside my sleeping bag.

Let's go out to Egypt 'cause it's in the plan,
sleep beside the pharoahs in the shifting sand.
We'll look at some pyramids and check out some heads.
Oh, we'll whip out our mattress 'cause there ain't no beds.
Slip inside my sleeping bag,
slip inside my sleeping bag.
