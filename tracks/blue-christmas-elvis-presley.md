I'll have a Blue Christmas without you
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
(Ahh, ahh)
Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me
(Ooh)


And when those blue snowflakes start fallin'
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
That's when those blue memories start callin'
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
(Ahh, ahh)
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas


(Oooooaaaooooh
Oooooaaaooooh)


You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
(Ahh, ahh)
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
