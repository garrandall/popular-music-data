Maybe you think I'm letting you go
Maybe it's not that way
Maybe I love you more than you know
Maybe you'll know someday
Maybe you think it's easy for me
Easy to say Goodbye
Maybe it hurts me more than you see
All I can do is cry

But love is not enough to make you mine
You need someone who's gonna be there all the time
Someone to treat you better
Someone to see you through
Someone who'd never say
Goodbye, I love you

Goodbye, I love you
Goodbye, I love you
Goodbye, I love you

You need a man who's always around 
Whenever you feel alone
You need a man who won't let you down
You need your man at home
You need the time to let yourself live
You haven't lived enough
You need the one thing I cannot give 
You need the time to love

But love is not enough to make you mine
You need someone who's gonna be there all the time
Someone to treat you better
Someone to see you through
Someone who'd never say
Goodbye, I love you

Goodbye, I love you
Goodbye, I love you
Goodbye, I love you
