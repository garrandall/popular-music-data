Aye, I hit the club (I Hit The Club), and buy the bar
In VIP just seen my partners and a lot of broads
It's such GI DJ pop them bottles, party hard
We done with today, I'm looking for tomorrow
All I do is turn up ain't no knowing don't concern us
All this bubble kush I burn up spend some regular with one us
Turning corner fishtailing out the parking lot, yelling BankHead, Westside, need a 9 chicks trailing
Right behind us been this way since we was minors, if it wasn't for the chicks up in this bitch you wouldn't find us
Either way I try the same thang, wanna came through the door, like here you go came for (Came For)

Bitches and the drinks (Yeah-hh), bitches and the drinks  (I Know You Know What I Came For)
(Ah) Baby get ya glass up (Get Ya Glass Up) I only came for the bitches and the drinks
Baby get ya ass up (Get Ya Ass Up) that's what I came for

Shout to every ten I see, when I'm down in Tennessee (Oh)


I only came here for 2 Reasons (I Only Came Here For), I-IIII can't lie (You know I can't lie, I Only Came For)


I only came for the bitches and the drinks
