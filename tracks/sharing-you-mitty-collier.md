Sharing you
I know I'm sharing you
I'm not the only one
Who's in your heart
When I'm with you
Your love belongs to me
But you have someone else
When we're apart

There are two of us who kiss you
Two of us who miss you
Two of us who wish there
Were two of you

And though it hurts me so
To go on sharing you
I know my helpless heart
Just can't be free
But even though
I must keep sharing you
You know you'll
Never be sharing me
