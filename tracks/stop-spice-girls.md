You just walk in, I make you smile
It's cool but you don't even know me
You take an inch, I run a mile
Can't win you're always right behind me
And we know that you could go and find some other
Take or leave it or just don't even bother
Caught in a craze, it's just a phase
Or will this be around forever


Don't you know it's going too fast
Racing so hard you know it won't last
Don't you know, why can't you see
Slow it down, read the sign
So you know just where you're going


Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with a human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun


Do do-do do, do do-do do
Do do-do, always be together
Ba da-ba ba, ba da-ba ba
Ba da-ba, stay that way forever


And we know that you could go and find some other
Take or leave it cause we've always got each other
You know who you are and yes, you're gonna breakdown
You've crossed the line so you're gonna have to turn around


Don't you know it's going too fast
Racing so hard you know it won't last
Don't you know, what can't you see
Slow it down, read the sign
So you know just where you're going


Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with a human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun


Gotta keep it down honey, lay your back on the line
'Cause I don't care about the money, don't be wasting my time
You need, less speed, get off my case
You gotta slow it down baby, just get out of my face


Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with a human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun
Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with a human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun
(Stop right now) Stop right now, thank you very much
(We wanna thank you, wanna thank you) I need somebody with a human touch
(Stop right now) Hey you, always on the run
(Thank you very much, thank you very much) Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun
