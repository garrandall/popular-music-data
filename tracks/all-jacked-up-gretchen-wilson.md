Hey yeah


Well, 5:30 pm rolls around, there's a lil ol' joint outside of town
Only got time for just a couple of beers
And a jukebox song ringing in my ears
The next thing you know the bartenders pouring,
shots are flowing, got me stone man
All I really know is that I should be going
But I'm soaking up the moment


And I'm all jacked up (all jacked up)
I'm all jacked up (all jacked up)
Don't believe I've ever had this much
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Time sure flies when you're all jacked up


It was getting mighty close to 9 o'clock
What the hell I'll have one more shot
Then I winked at a boy at the end of the bar
Guess I might of must of gone a lil too far
Cause a big ol' girl walked outta the blue
Ten foot two with a bad attitude
Stepped right up and knocked out my tooth
I guess I had it coming I deserved it too


Cause I was all jacked up (all jacked up)
All jacked up (all jacked up)
Don't believe I've ever had this much
One thing I've learned when you get tore up,
Don't start no stuff when you're all jacked up


Don't have to go home but you can't stay here
That's what they said when I got my last beer
Oh my god it's 2 o'clock
I can't find my keys and my truck's locked
So I grab a tire tool and I broke my window, hurt my elbow, got me in though
2 Foot later backed into the light pole
All the town folk got a good show


All jacked up (all jacked up)
All jacked up (all jacked up)
Don't believe I've ever had this much
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't drive your truck when you're all jacked up

Jacked up (all jacked up)
(All jacked up)

WOOOOO
One thing I've learned when you get tore up,
Don't start no stuff when your all jacked up
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't drive your car
don't start no stuff in no bar
Hell I wouldn't even tell anybody where you are
When your all jacked up
(all jacked up)
All jacked up


Yeah
