I know that you wanted someone to play with
While i wanted someone to love
And you made me feel that your love was real
The love that i always dreamed of

And then you laughed when i cried for your kisses
To me they meant heaven above
Oh, oh, oh you wanted someone to play with
While i wanted someone to love

(oh, you wanted someone to play)
(while i wanted someone to love)
And you made me feel that your love was real
The love that i always dreamed of

And then you laughed when i cried for your kisses
To me they meant heaven above
Oh, oh, oh you wanted someone to play with
While i wanted, while i wanted someone to love
