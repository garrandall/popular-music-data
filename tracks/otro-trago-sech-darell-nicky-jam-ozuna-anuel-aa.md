Keep here taking another dri-
(¡This is the remix!)
Life has not been easy for you
You went wrong in love
There's something about him that doesn't please you anymore (Please you)
That's why she goes out and do what she does (Woh, oh)
Life is one and time will not stop
I tell you because I have seen how you get lost loving (Loving‚ oh)
Baby‚ I think time is running out
He changed you being better than her (No-no-no‚ no-oh-oh)
For women and a couple of bottles (Of bottles; no-no-no, no-oh-oh)
For friends who aren't really friends (Ah, ah; ice)
Because I know they will write to you when he leaves you
(Uah‚ uah; *everybody go to the discotek!*)


And now in secret and without dissimulation (That's right)
I found her wanting to forget her ex (Uah-ah-ah; hah!)
Now she does what she wants when she wants (Oh-oh)
And if she don't want to, you're another one who gets screwed too (Here we go again!)


When the DJ turns on the music (That's like that)
She dances like never before (Real until death, baby; so that you knows)
And now in secret (Oh-oh)‚ and without dissimulation (Oh-oh)
I found her wanting to forget her ex (Ra-ta-ta-tá!)
When the DJ turns on the music
She dances like never before (The Real Rondón)
Now she does what she wants when she wants
And if she don't want to, you're another one who gets screwed too


They left her alone, now she shows it on the disco
She always dances uncensored, for a man she doesn't cry (She doesn't cry)
Don't trust anyone, anyone (Anyone)
Today's are drink day and for the street, street (Street)
She wants to drink, she wants to dance (Dance)
And she wants to smoke and she's going to get drunk (Drunk)
She doesn't love anymore and doesn't call and doesn't claim
And I look for her in Lambo' and we end up in my bed


I don't want to talk about him, let's go to the wall (Wall)
I want to see everything you know (You know)
You are asking me to put, but here it doesn't fit (Fits)
She wanted to lose her rhythm and I have the key, yeh-yeh-yeh
Do you want to see how hard am I? (Hard)
Come on, baby, it's that I'm without insurance
When I'm with you, I always feel good, yeah
You are mine, I swear you


Baby, when the DJ turns on the music (That's like that)
She dances like never before (So that you knows)
And now in secret (Oh-oh), and without dissimulation (Oh-oh)
I found her wanting to forget her ex (Ra-ta-ta-tá!)
When the DJ turns on the music
She dances like never before (The Real Rondón)
Now she does what she wants when she wants
And if she don't want to, you're another one who gets screwed too


Who wants me to take her to a private place
But to do it without anyone noticing
She told me he has a tough boyfriend
She tells me that why I arrive and don't greet
I said: "Forgive me, baby, I'm unique"
Drop the music bass, I want to see you
Sweating, baby, until dawn
There's another baby that wants to see me, you have to know
But, calm down, I'm having a good time, you too
It doesn't matter, baby, whatever who says (Whatever says)
I know that he doesn't value you (Value)
But I'm not for love now, baby
Enjoy and don't look at the time (The time)
I only fall in love with you, lady (Lady)


Woh-woh-woh, stop that shit, nigga
Now, the days are gray for her (That's right)
Because their mornings aren't happy (Hah!)
He no longer treats her as before (So that you knows)
She is single and she want to go to the disco (Ra-ta-ta-tá!)
Let me take you and ride you in the red Mercedes (That's right; red)
You going to get excited (You get excited; hah!)
For that you blush with me (Here we go again!)
While you forget everything bad he did to you
Forget it, it's been a while since he forgot about you (That's right)
I want to keep you, baby, I want to be your boyfriend (Oh-oh)
You are pretty with your beautiful body (Hah!)
And that tummy with more squares than Tetris


When the DJ turns on the music (That’s like that)
She dances like never before (Real until death, baby; so that you knows)
And now in secret (Oh-oh), and without dissimulation (Oh-oh)
I found her wanting to forget her ex


When the DJ puts the music, music (-ic)
She enjoys it while she can (Woh, oh)
Now dance, smoke, drink, all alone
She arrives at the house and they don't tell her anything
What a good life she has (She is)
She is drunk, but asks for another bottle (Ah-ah-ah)
Is that at that time the note is high
She highlights happiness


And now in secret and without dissimulation (That's right)
I found her wanting to forget her ex (Uah-ah-ah; hah!; Anuel)
Now she does what she wants when she wants (Oh-oh)
And if she don't want to, you're another one who gets screwed too (Here we go again!)


When the DJ turns on the music (That’s like that)
She dances like never before (Real until death, baby; so that you knows)
And now in secret (Oh-oh), and without dissimulation (Oh-oh)
I found her wanting to forget her ex (Ra-ta-ta-tá!)
When the DJ turns on the music
She dances like never before (The Real Rondón)
Now she does what she wants when she wants
And if she don't want to, you're another one who gets screwed too


Everybody go to the discotek; atention!
