Seems like everybody's got a price
I wonder how they sleep at night
When the sale comes first and the truth comes second
Stop for a minute and smile
Why is everybody so serious?
Acting so damn mysterious
Got shades on your eyes and your heels so high
You can't even have a good time

Everybody look to their left
Everybody look to their right
Can you feel that?
We're paying with love tonight

It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money (money, money)
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the (uh) cha-ching cha-ching
Ain't about the (yeah) ba-bling ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag

We need to take it back in time
When music made us all unite
And it wasn't low blows, and video
Am I the only one getting tired?
Why is everybody so obsessed?
Money can't buy us happiness
Can we all slow down and enjoy right now?
Guaranteed we'll be feeling alright

Everybody look to their left
Everybody look to their right
Can you feel that, yeah?
We're paying with love tonight

It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money (money, money)
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the (uh) cha-ching cha-ching
Ain't about the (yeah) ba-bling ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag

Well, keep the price tag
And take the cash back
Just give me six strings
And a half stack
It's like this, man, you can't put a price on a life
We do this for the love so we fight and sacrifice
Every night, we ain't gon' stumble and fall never
Waiting to see a sign of defeat, uh uh
So we gon' keep everybody, move your feet
Bring back the beat, uh
And everyone

It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money (money, money)
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the (uh) cha-ching cha-ching
Ain't about the (yeah) ba-bling ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag

It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money (money, money)
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the (uh) cha-ching cha-ching
Ain't about the (yeah) ba-bling ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag

It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the (uh) cha-ching cha-ching
Ain't about the (yeah) ba-bling ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
