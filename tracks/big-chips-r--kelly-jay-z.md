Big chips! (Woo!)
We off in Vegas drinking and partying
We got chicks in swimsuits modeling
We in the twin stretch Maybachs dipping low
The way the wrist shine it's so magical
You know them boys got the clubs out of control (Ho!)
Nigga what ya heard, it's Kells and Hov'
With the second coming of Best of Both
In the first week I predict a million sold, we talking...


Big chips! Big trips to Vegas, nigga
Big cribs and the whips is spacious (Uh huh)
Any day they could dig your grave
Shit, so big is my inspiration, dig?
No reward unless the risk is taken
In which case you niggas wouldn't wanna switch places
I, on the other hand, relish the situation
Thank the Lord for the gift, I'm gracious
I went overboard, look at this big bracelet
I overhauled it, you wouldn't recognize it
From the time that I bought it, I just replaced it
I risk cases for shit like this
Nigga , I pray for some shit like this
Word to my Uncle Ray, who gave his life for some shit like this
Ma, you rolling? I'm as real as it gets


Big chips! (Woo!)
We off in Vegas drinking and partying
We got chicks in swimsuits modeling
We in the twin stretch Maybachs dipping low
The way the wrist shine it's so magical
You know them boys got the clubs out of control (Ho!)
Nigga what ya heard, it's Kells and Hov'
With the second coming of Best of Both
In the first week I predict a million sold, we talking...


Big chips! I can't take this
The way you move your ass slow like Matrix
You make me wanna toss chips in Vegas
Before I toss chips, first, get naked
I can't fake it, girl you got the club shut down when you freak it
Superstar honey, so mean and vicious
Got a lot in common, I'm so mean and vicious
Bark bark farmer, this chicken laying platinum ex-farmer (preach!)
So go low mama, give it a go
As I punch 170 on stretch road
Must turn up the radio
Girl you so good I'm swerving like 'Whoa, whoa!'
Uh oh! Uh uh oh! From the club to the stretch
Out the stretch to the hotel, into the hotel suite!


Big chips! (Woo!)
We off in Vegas drinking and partying
We got chicks in swimsuits modeling
We in the twin stretch Maybachs dipping low
The way the wrist shine it's so magical
You know them boys got the clubs out of control (Ho!)
Nigga what ya heard, it's Kells and Hov'
With the second coming of Best of Both (I'm a boss, baby!)
In the first week I predict a million sold, we talking...


Big chips! I'm a boss I said
Tilt my hat and I cross my legs
Like old ladies at the park, I toss my bread
And the pigeons start flocking, ballin' like Bishop Loughlin
And stick Cochran on any D.A. why try to stop him
So any gunplay, that is an option
I been doing this since niggas was wopping
Rockin Izods with the matching socks, and
Slap boxing in the back park and when the girls start watching
To try to get real, you had to drop 'em
See I ain't never been a fronter
Or fake it 'til I make it type nigga
Ma I don't want ya number
Either you're coming or aIone ya
Either you know what you want ma, or I don't even want ya
You play pretty if you wanna, hah


Big chips! (Woo!)
We off in Vegas drinking and partying
We got chicks in swimsuits modeling
We in the twin stretch Maybachs dipping low
The way the wrist shine it's so magical
You know them boys got the clubs out of control (Ho!)
Nigga what ya heard, it's Kells and Hov'
With the second coming of Best of Both
In the first week I predict a million sold, we talking...


All around the world, stop where the sun sets
Spending big chips you wanna go (Uh oh, uh uh oh!)
You wanna go (Uh oh, uh uh oh!)
Say we going around the world, stop where the sun sets
Spending big chips you wanna go (Uh oh, uh uh oh!)
Do you wanna go (Uh oh, uh uh oh!)


Uh, come on, Tone, I see ya
Jigga, Kells, uh, yeah, Trackmasters
What's really good
We in the islands chillin in the shade and shit you know
Blue waters, yellow sand, uh
Either I'm high or, I think I just saw a dolphin
