Every day my imagination anticipates
Ways I can show you how much I love you
Candy, flowers, priceless pearls
Romantic trips around the world, baby, just think

You and me floating on the Caribbean sea
So exotic, I just can just feel heat
And there?s candlelight with the moon so high
Hangin? in a Spanish sky but before right or wrong, hoo, girl

You?ve got to let me know
Just how far to let this go
(Oh)
Help me
(Darling, please show me)
Show me
(How to love you)

You?ve got to take my hand
Show me that you?ll understand
Help me
(Hoo, baby)
Show me

And if time won?t allow for such an affair, darling, I don?t care
We don?t have to go anywhere
We?ll stay at home, turn the lights down low, play our favorite video
Or better still make our own private show

And we?ll love so deeply, I feel your arms completely
With love that only we can share
I?ll taste your sweet lips, caress your fingertips
But before I go on, hoo, oh oh

You?ve got to let me know
(You know, baby)
Just how far to let this go
(I wanna love you, baby)
Help me
(Hey)
Show me
(How I could love you more each day)

You?ve got to take my hand
Show me that you?ll understand
(Don?t want our love to slip away)
Help me, show me

Baby, please, please let me know
How to be everything for you
Just show me what to do, oh, baby
I?ll make sweet love to you all night long
I?m holding on to the words of this love song, baby

Hoo
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Show me, show me
Oh, girl
Hey, ey

You?ve got to let me know
(Oh, baby)
Just how far to let this go
Help me
(Oh, baby, show me)
Show me
(How I could love you more and more each day)

You?ve got to take my hand
Show me that you?ll understand
(How I can love you)
Help me
(Say it)
Show me
(I wanna fantasize with you, baby)

You?ve got to let me know
Just how far to let this go
(Take you away, girl)
Help me
(And just show me)
Show me
(How I can love you)

You?ve got to take my hand
(Oh, oh, oh)
Show me that you?ll understand
(I wanna hold you all night long, girl)
Help me
(Hey)
Show me
(I wanna fantasize all the love we?re makin?)

You?ve got to let me know
(Just gonna love you)
Just how far to let this go
(Oh, baby, baby, baby)
Help me
(Hey)
Show me
(I wanna love you)

You?ve got to take my hand
(Oh)
Show me that you?ll understand
Help me
(Help me, help me)
Show me
(Show me, girl)
