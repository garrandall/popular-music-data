Funk dat!


Question:
Why is it that every time I'm walking down the street
Somebody wants to stop me
Just to give me a flyer?


Come on, man!
Funk dat!
Get out of my way!


Question:
Why is it that every time I walk into the bank
The tellers look at me
Like I'm the one that robbed them last week?


Come on, man
Funk dat!
What are you lookin' at?


Question:
Why is it that every time I turn on the radio
I hear the same 5 songs
15 times a day, for 3 months?


Man...
Funk dat!
Get a new DJ!


Question:
Why is it that bums ask me for money
When I ain't got none?
What is it an "in" thing or something?
Let me remind this dude he ain't got no money, hm?


Man...
Funk dat!
Get a job!


You know
Every time I see my neighbor
She tells me to stay out of trouble
The other one looks at me
Like I'm the one that got her daughter strung out


Come on, man
Funk dat!
What are you lookin' at?


Seems like every time
It never fails, it never fails
I'm just chillin' in my crib
Mindin' my on business
And somebody wants to call me just to talk about nothin'


Funk dat!
Get a life!


Question:
Why is it that when I go out to a nightclub
Only the ugly chicks want to step to me?
I mean, like I'm ugly or somethin', huh?
What you mean, huh?


Funk dat!
Get out of my face!
