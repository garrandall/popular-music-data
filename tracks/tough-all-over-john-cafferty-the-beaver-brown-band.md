Well, she's waiting for the bus
Down on the boulevard
Pretty little working girl
She ain't got no fancy clothes
Don't drive no fancy car
She's the waitress
At the bar and grill

She's on her own now
He left and went away
He really broke her heart
It just worked out that way


Well, all over and all over
Things are tough all over
Well, all over and all over
Things, things are tough all over

Well, he's drinking at the bar
Down by the old boat yard
He sits and he talks to strangers
The factory laid him off
And life's been getting hard
It's enough to make a good man bad

He's got that look in his eye
There's just no words to say
It's tough to swallow your pride
Each and every day



Heres one for the broken hearted
It's tough just to get things started
All over again, all over again

He's got that look in his eye
There's just no words to say
It's tough to swallow your pride
Each and every day



Things are tough all over
Things are tough all over
Things are tough all over
Things are tough all over...
