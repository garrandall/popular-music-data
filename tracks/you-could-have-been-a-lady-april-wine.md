Could have been alright, could have been here tonight
Could have been sweet as wine, could have been a lady
I could have been alright, could have been here tonight
Could have been sweet as wine, could have been a lady

They all need you to make love to
When you awake, you find them on the bed lyin' beside you
They all love you, you're a good girl
And I ain't surprised when you realize just where you're goin' to

You could have been alright, could have been here tonight
Could have been sweet as wine, could have been a lady
It could have been alright, could have been here tonight
Could have been sweet as wine, could have been a lady

If I told you where you're goin' to
You'd laugh in my face, say I'm out of place, mind your business
And they all want you to make love to
It's a shame, the fate of the game, the way it delights you

Could have been alright, could have been here tonight
Could have been sweet as wine, could have been a lady
It could have been alright, could have been here tonight
Could have been sweet as wine, could have been a lady

Na, na na na na, na
Na, na na na na, na
Na, na na na na, na, na na

Na, na na na na, na
Na, na na na na, na
Na, na na na na, na, na na

Alright, could have been here tonight
Could have been sweet as wine, could have been a lady
It could have been alright, could have been here tonight
Could have been sweet as wine, could have been a lady
