Rocking with the top down
Barrelling down Highway 9
Picking up the same crowd
By the exit sign

Baby, gun your cares
Paint your lips
And it shines like glass

Midnight riders
Lovers
And rock and roll
Oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah


Gotta it in the blood
The kid's American
Underneath the hood
You know

The kid's American
Cause he looks so good
The kid's American
Cruising faster than he should
The kid's American


Out behind the high school
Smoking that cigarette
Deep into the blue jeans
And going to get deeper yet

Oh, the night cougars
Something's in the wind
And it's coming fast
Hold on, baby
Try to take it slow
Oh, no
Yeah, yeah

Dragging on all night
Til there's nothing left
By morning light
Driving til your chassis bottoms out
Oh, yeah
