Baby you're the only reason
That this ain't my favorite season
I spend all my time just counting the days
And I wish you would come and see me
Or at least half way to meet me
But Michigan's just so far away

Oh, the sunset's always lovely
Oh, but I'd rather be with you

One more week 'til were together
Then I'll finally see your face
This whole month felt like forever and a day
Babe I'm feeling kind of lonely
Those three words just ain't enough
You can tell me that you love me
But that ain't what your boyfriend said

He's got a sports car and some money
And I think it's kind of funny
This shouldn't have been such a surprise
And there's no use getting angry
'Cause I see it now so plainly
Thru the subtle hint of red in my eyes

Oh, you never seem to answer
Oh, are you with him instead

One more week 'til were together
Then I'll finally see your face
This whole month felt like forever and a day
Babe I'm feeling kind of lonely
Those three words just ain't enough
You can tell me that you love me
But that ain't what your boyfriend said

So tell me, did you lie when you said you loved me
Tell me, did you lie when you said you cared
'Cause that ain't what your boyfriend
That ain't what your boyfriend
No that ain't what your boyfriend said

One more week 'til were together
Then I'll finally see your face
This whole month felt like forever and a day
Babe I'm feeling kind of lonely
Those three words just ain't enough
You can tell me that you love me
But that ain't what your boyfriend said
