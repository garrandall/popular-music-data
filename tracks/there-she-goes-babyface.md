It's something about her you know that
The way she cares of herself, she's just so bad
Ooh, I dont know


Her style, her mind compares
To nothing on this earth
She's not the kind to share
Only God know what she's worth


I gotta show her that I want her
I recognize that she is bad
If I can't have her then I'll go crazy
Spending all my time just chasing
I gotta show her that I want her
I recognize that she is bad
If I can't have her then I'll go crazy
Spending all my time just chasing


Her eyes, her smile, her skin
Her smell, her hair (She's incredible, baby, ooh)
Her walk, her talk, her way her savoir faire
There she goes, there she goes
(There she goes)


I hope to find her there
Gotta make some eye contact
She's not the kind to stare
Move quick or lose her fast


I gotta show her that I want her
I recognize that she is bad
If I can't have her then I'll go crazy
Spending all my time just chasing
I gotta show her that I want her
I recognize that she is bad
If I can't have her then I'll go crazy
Spending all my time just chasing


Her eyes, her smile, her skin
Her smell, her hair (Ooh baby, she's incredible, baby)
Her walk, her talk, her way, her savoir faire
There she goes, there she goes, ooh
(There she goes)
Her eyes, her smile, her skin
Her smell, her hair (You're incredible, baby)
Her walk, her talk, her way, her savoir faire
There she goes (There she goes)


Spending all my time watchin' that girl go (dance)
Gotta love the way she moves (Get down, girl)
Spending all my time watchin' that girl go (dance)
Gotta love the way she moves


Her eyes, her smile, her skin
Her smell, her hair (She's incredible, baby)
Her walk, her talk, her way, her savoir faire
There she goes (There she goes, baby)
Her eyes, her smile, her skin
Her smell, her hair (You're incredible, baby)
Her walk, her talk, her way, her savoir faire
There she goes (There she goes)
Her eyes, her smile, her skin
Her smell, her hair (Oh, baby, yeah)
Her walk, her talk, her way, her savoir faire
There she goes (There she goes)


Spending all my time watchin' that girl go (dance)
Gotta love the way she moves (Get down, girl)
Spending all my time watchin' that girl go (dance)
Watch her go, watch her go
Gotta love the way she moves (dance)

I got to show her that I want her
Spending all my time watchin' that girl go
If I can't have her, then I'll go crazy
Gotta love the way she moves
I got to show her that I want her
Spending all my time watchin' that girl go
If I can't have her, then I'll go crazy
Gotta love the way she moves
I got to show her that I want her...
If I can't have her, then I'll go crazy...
I got to show her that I want her...
