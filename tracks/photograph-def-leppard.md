I'm outta luck, outta love
Got a photograph, picture of
Passion killer, you're too much
You're the only one I wanna touch

I see your face every time I dream
On every page, every magazine
So wild and free,
So far from me
You're all I want, my fantasy

Look what you've done to this rock 'n' roll clown
Look what you've done

Photograph
I don't want your photograph
I don't need your photograph
All I've got is a photograph
But it's not enough

I'd be your lover, if you were there
Put your hurt on me, if you dare
Such a woman, you got style
You make every man feel like a child

You got some kinda hold on me
You're all wrapped up in mystery
So wild and free
So far from me
You're all I want, my fantasy

Look what you've done to this rock 'n' roll clown
Look what you've done

I gotta have you

Photograph
I don't want your Photograph
I don't need your photograph
All I've got is a photograph

You've gone straight to my head

Look what you've done to this rock 'n' roll clown
Look what you've done

I gotta have you

Photograph
I don't want your photograph
I don't need your photograph
All I've got is a photograph

I wanna touch you

Photograph
Photograph
Your photograph
Photograph
Photograph
I need more than your photograph
I'm outta love
Photograph
I'm outta love
Photograph
You're the only one
Photograph
I wanna touch
