I remember Spanish nights and you
Soft guitars that sang of love so new
Though we were just strangers when we met
We shared a love no strangers could forget

Soon our different worlds drifted apart
But still those Spanish nights live in my heart
When you said, "Yo te amo" then I knew
I must return to Spanish nights and you

I remember those Spanish nights, mi amor
I wish I could hear the music of noches Espa√±oles

(Incomprehensible)

And, darling, although we have drifted apart
You're still in my heart

When you said, "Yo te amo" then I knew
I must return to Spanish nights and you

I remember those Spanish nights, mi amor
I wish I could hear
