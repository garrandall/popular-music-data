Even though it isn't healthy
Won't you help me?
I need some more love
And you know I'm not myself, please
Won't you help me?
I need some more love

Yeah, won't you help me?
I need help please, I need some more love
Yeah, won't you help me?
This not healthy, when I need some more love
Yeah, fuck my life (fuck it)
Baby, fuck my life (fuck it)
It is yours (yeah)
Fuck my life (fuck it)
