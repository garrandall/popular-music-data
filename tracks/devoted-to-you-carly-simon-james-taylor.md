Darlin' you can count on me
Till the sun dries up the sea
Until then I'll always be
Devoted to you

I'll be yours till endless time
I'll adore your charms sublime
Guess by now you know that I'm
Devoted to you

I'll never hurt you
I'll never lie
I'll never be untru

I'll never give you reason to cry
I'd be unhappy if you were blue

Through the years our love will grow
Like a river it will flow
It can't die because I'm so
Devoted to you

I'll never give you reason to cry
I'd be unhappy if you were blue

Throught the years our love will grow
Like a river it will flow
It can't die because I'm so
Devoted to you

Devoted to you
