She's been afraid to go out
She's afraid of the knock on her door
There's always a shade of a doubt
She can never be sure
Who comes to call
Maybe the friend of a friend of a friend
Anyone at all
Anything but nothing again
It used to be her town
It used to be her towntoo
It used to be her town
It used to be her towntoo
Seems like even her old girlfriends
Might be talking her down
She's got her name on the grapevine
Running up and down
The telephone line
Talking 'bout
Someone saidsomeone said
Something 'boutsomething else
Someone might have said about her
She always figured that they were her friends
But maybe they can live without her
It used to be her town
It used to be her towntoo

It used to be her town
It used to be her towntoo
Wellpeople got used to seeing them both together
But now he's gone and life goes on
Nothing lasts foreveroh no
She gets the house and the garden
He gets the boys in the band
Some of them his friends
Some of them her friends
Some of them understand
Lord knows that this is just a small town city
Yesand everyone can see you fall
It's got nothing to do with pity
I just wanted to give you a call
It used to be your town
It used to be my towntoo
You never know 'till it all falls down
Somebody loves you
Somebody loves you
Darlingsomebody still loves you
I can still remember
When it used to be her towntoo
It used to be your town
It used to be my towntoo
