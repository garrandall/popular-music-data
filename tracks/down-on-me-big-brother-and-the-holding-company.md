Down on me, down on me
Looks like everybody in this whole round world
They're down on me

Love in this world is so hard to find
When you've got yours and I got mine
That's why it looks like everybody in this whole round world
They're down on me

Saying they're down on me, down on me
Looks like everybody in this whole round world
Down on me

When you see a hand that's held out toward you
Give it some love, some day it may be you
That's why it looks like everybody in this whole round world
They're down on me, yeah

Lord, they're down on me, down on me, oh!
Looks like everybody in this whole round world
Is down on me

Believe in your brother, have faith in man
Help each other, honey, if you can
Because it looks like everybody in this whole round world
Is down on me

I'm saying down on me, oh, down on me, oh!
It looks like everybody in this whole round world
Down on me!
