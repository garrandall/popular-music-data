I've been saving the things you gave me
I've been holding em close to me
All the letters that said you loved me
And the picture of you holding me

And I've been meaning to call and tell you
After all that we've been through
I know what to do with the memories
But I found something here I can't use

What can I do with this broken heart
And a goodbye that leaves me nowhere
What can I do with this broken heart
And a love I can't get over

I remember the words that were spoken
How we used em so carelessly
What we thought would last forever
Ended so suddenly, so suddenly

What can I do with this broken heart
And a goodbye that leaves me nowhere
What can I do with this broken heart
And a love I can't get over

And a love I can't get over
Can't get over you

What can I do with this broken heart
And a goodbye that leaves me nowhere
What can I do with this broken heart
And a love I can't get over

I can't get over you

What can I do with this broken heart
And a goodbye that leaves me nowhere
What can I do with this broken heart
And a love I can't get over

I can't get over
Can't get over you

What can I do with this broken heart
And a goodbye that leaves me nowhere
What can I do with this broken heart
And a love I can't get over
