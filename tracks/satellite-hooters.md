Hush little baby don't cry like that 
God's gonna buy you a Cadillac 
He's chosen you to do his will 
You can spread the word in your coupe de ville 

So jump in the river and learn to swim 
God's gonna wash away all your sins 
And if you still can't see the light 
God's gonna buy you a satellite 

Look to the heavens and see it shine 
Heals the sick and leads the blind 
Tune it in and hear it say 
It's countin' down to judgment day 

So jump in the river and learn to swim 
God's gonna wash away all your sins 
And if you still can't see the light 
God's gonna buy you a satellite 

Hey satellite man your time has come 
Your word received by everyone 
And should you fall, well that's ok 
You love the ones that you betray 

So jump in the river and learn to swim 
God's gonna wash away all your sins 
And when at last you see the light 
God's gonna buy you a satellite
