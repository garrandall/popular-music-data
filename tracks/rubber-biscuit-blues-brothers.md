(Um, do that again)

Bow bow bow

Have you ever heard of a wish sandwich?
A wish sandwich is the kind of a sandwich where you have two slices of bread and you, hee hee hee, wish you had some meat...

Bow bow bow

Ummm... the other day I had a ricochet biscuit.
A ricochet biscuit is the kind of a biscuit that's supposed to bounce back off the wall into your mouth.
If it don't bounce back... you go hungry!
Bow bow bow

Umm, umm, umm... the other day I had a cool water sandwich and a Sunday-go-to-meetin' bun...
Bow bow bow

Hee hee hee hee... What da ya want for nothing? ... a rubber biscuit?
Bow bow bow
