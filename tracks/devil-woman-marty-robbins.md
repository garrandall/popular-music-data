I told Mary about us.
I told her about our great sin.
Mary cried and forgave me,
Then Mary took me back again,
Said if I wanted my freedom
I could be free ever more.
But I don't want to be,
And I don't want to see
Mary cry anymore.

Oh, Devil Woman,
Devil Woman, let go of me.
Devil Woman, let me be,
And leave me alone.
I want to go home.

Mary is waitin' and weepin'
Down in our shack by the sea.
Even after I've hurt her,
Mary's still in love with me.
Devil Woman it's over,
Trapped no more by your charms,
Cause I don't want to stay.
I want to get away.
Woman let go of my arm.

Oh, Devil Woman,
Devil Woman, let go of me.
Devil Woman, let me be,
And leave me alone.
I want to go home.

Devil Woman, you're evil,
Like the dark coral reef.
Like the winds that bring high tides,
You bring sorrow and grief.
You made me ashamed to face Mary.
Barely had the strength to tell.
Skies are not so black.
Mary took me back.
Mary has broken your spell.

Oh, Devil Woman,
Devil Woman, let go of me.
Devil Woman, let me be,
And leave me alone.
I want to go home.

Runnin' along by the seashore,
Runnin' as fast as I can.
Even the seagulls are happy,
Glad I'm comin' home again.
Never again will I ever
Cause another tear to fall.
Down the beach I see
What belongs to me,
The one I want most of all.

Oh, Devil Woman,
Devil Woman, don't follow me.
Devil Woman let me be,
And leave me alone.
I'm goin' back home.
