Do you get suspicious?
Watch for the glances?
Don't put your love life in the streets

Do you get suspicious?
Watch for the glances?
You better take it from me

Friends, who needs 'em?
One can't live with 'em, can't live without
Men, can't keep 'em
Not when your good friend is trying to bring you down
Down, down, down

Do you get suspicious when they call you their girlfriend
And you don't know them very well?
Watch for the glances on the side to your boyfriend
Just read the signs, I'm sure you can tell

You see somebody standing in your own backyard
Somebody's trying to steal your man
Don't be a fool and let them get that far
You better stop them while you can
Hold on to your man

Hold, hold
Hold on to him
Hold on
Hold, hold

Trends, they feed 'em
They all jump on it, on whatever is hot
But girlfriends be careful
Because your man might be just what they ain't got, no

You should be cautious if you've found you a good man
Don't put your love life in the streets
There is a shortage of good love from a good man
So watch your back, you better take it from me

You see somebody standing in your own backyard
Somebody's trying to steal your man
They'll try and steal your man
Don't be a fool and let them get that far, no fool
You better stop them while you can
Stop them while you can

Hold, hold
Hold on to him
Hold on
Hold, hold

You better take it from me
Don't be no fool

Yo, you better watch out, she's out to take your guy
And I can see why, he's fly even I
Had my eye on him for a long time
Yo Pep, what? kick that rhyme

Don't be dumb, all the girlie's want some
He's paid, he's not a bum
Know where I'm coming from?
Understand she has a plan
And that's right, she'll take your man

So you better hold on tight
She'll take your man and you know that I'm right
She'll take your man, girls be on your best guard
'Cause she'll take your man, right from your own backyard

Oh, if you see somebody standing in your own backyard
They're out to get your man, girl don't you let them in
Don't you be a fool and let them get that far
So stop them while you can, they've got a master plan

You see somebody standing in your own backyard
Somebody's trying to steal your man
You better take it from me
Don't be a fool and let them get that far, no fool
You better stop them while you can

'Cause when you snooze, you lose
That's when they make their move
So stop them while you can
It's just a matter of time and girl that ain't no lie
They're out to take your man
Hold on to your man

Hold on, hold on, hold on to your man
Hold on, hold on, take it from me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, to your man
Hold on, hold on, can't you see?

Do you get suspicious?
Watch for the glances?
Don't put your love life in the streets

Do you get suspicious?
Watch for the glances?
You better take it from me

Oh, if you see somebody standing in your own backyard
They're out to get your man, girl don't you let them in
Don't you be a fool and let them get that far
So stop them while you can, they've got a master plan

You see somebody standing in your own backyard
Somebody's trying to steal your man
You better take it from me
Don't be a fool and let them get that far, no fool
You better stop them while you can

'Cause when you snooze, you lose
That's when they make their move
So stop them while you can
It's just a matter of time and girl that ain't no lie
They're out to take your man
Hold on to your man

Hold on, hold on, hold on to your man
Hold on, hold on, take it from me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, can't you see?
