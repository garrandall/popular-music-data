Oh I'll miss him
Woah I'll miss him
Woah I'll miss him

I want him and I need him
And someday, someway, woah oh oh oh, I'll meet him
He'll be kind of shy and real good looking too
And I'll be certain he's my guy by the things he'll like to do

Like walking in the rain
(Like walking in the rain)
Wishing on the stars up above
(And wishing on the stars up)
And being so in love

When he's near me I'll kiss him
When he leaves me woah oh oh oh, I'll miss him
Though sometimes we'll fight I won't really care
I know it's gonna be all right 'cause we've got so much we share

Like walking in the rain
(Like walking in the rain)
Wishing on the stars up above
(And wishing on the stars)
Being so in love

(Johnny)
No he'll never do
(Harvey)
No, it isn't him, too

They would never, no they'd never
Never, ever love
(Never, ever)

Walking in the rain
(Like walking in the rain)
Wishing on the stars up above
(And wishing on the stars)
Being so in love

Woah, where can he be?
Woah, I'm still waiting
Woah, where can he be?
Woah
