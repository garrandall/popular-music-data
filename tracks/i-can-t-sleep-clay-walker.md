I been up all night long
Just waitin on the sun
I've given up, damn the dawn
It ain't never gonna come
Something's wrong,
As long as your gone

I'm not gonna sleep
Til I touch your face
Baby not a wink,
I could go for days,
If you ever needed
To see me down on my knees
Take a look at me
Baby I can't sleep

Remember when
You said we wouldn't last
I couldn't swallow my pride
Oh its sinkin in,
Baby losing you has
Finally opened my eyes
I'm wide awake
As long as it takes

I'm not gonna sleep
Til I touch your face
Baby not a wink,
I could go for days
If you ever needed
To see me down on my knees
Take a look at me
Baby I can't sleep

I'm not gonna sleep
Til I touch your face
Baby not a wink
I could go for days
If you ever needed
To see me down on my knees
Take a look at me
Baby I can't sleep
Til I touch your face
Baby not a wink,
I could go for days
I'm not gonna sleep
Til I touch your face
Baby not a wink,
I can't sleep
