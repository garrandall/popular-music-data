I got a funny feelin'
The moment that your lips touched mine
Somethin' shot right through me
My heart skipped a beat in time
There's a different feel about you tonight
It's got me thinkin' lots of crazy things
I even think I saw a flash of light
It felt like electricity


You shouldn't kiss me like this, unless you mean it like that
'Cause I'll just close my eyes and I won't know where I'm at
We'll get lost on this dance floor, spinnin' around
And around and around and around
They're all watchin' us now, they think we're fallin' in love
They'd never believe we're just friends
When you kiss me like this, I think you mean it like that
If you do baby kiss me again


Everybody swears we make the perfect pair
But dancin' is as far as it goes
Girl you've never moved me quite
Quite the way you moved me tonight
I just wanted you to know
I just wanted you to know


You shouldn't kiss me like this, unless you mean it like that
'Cause I'll just close my eyes and I won't know where I'm at
And we'll get lost on this dance floor, spinnin' around
And around and around and around
They're all watchin' us now, they think we're fallin' in love
They'd never believe we're just friends
When you kiss me like this, I think you mean it like that
If you do baby kiss me again
