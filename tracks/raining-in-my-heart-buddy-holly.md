The sun is out
The sky is blue
There's not a cloud
To spoil the view
But it's raining
Raining In My Heart

The Weather Man
Says "Clear today"
He doesn't know
You've gone away
And it's raining
Raining In My Heart

Oh misery - misery
What's gonna become of me

I tell my blues
They mustn't show
But soon these tears
Are bound to flow
Cause it's raining
Raining In My Heart
Raining In My Heart
Raining In My Heart
