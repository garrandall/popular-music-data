You know me
(Oh-h-h-h-h)
You know me
(Oh, na-na-na-na-na-na)
You know me
(Whoa)
You know me


I used to pray to hear my songs on the radio
Growing up, my foot was only after kickin doors
Keep sixty bitches backstage, at like every show
Ainât no more Hanes on my balls, these are Kenneth Cole
All these squares in my pictures, yeah, we croppin' those
Let âlil shawty lick my dick, I had my boxers on
Everybody 'round me poppin, bitch, we kettle corn
Private, PJ on the e-way with the P-1
Carat and a half dripping on my neck, son
Take a bubble bath with a rapper's baby mom
Young dirty nigga rocking, water like a swamp
Yeah, I just fucked up last night, didn't tell em' my name
All these hip-hop rappers down to be Drake
All my double cups purple like the soul plane (na-na-na-na-na)
Diamonds on me loud, got you silent
Got her bouncing on this dick like hydraulics


'Cause you know me, you know me
You know me, you know me
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (pow! pow!), you know me

Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gone let them hits fly, we gone let it go
If it ain't XO then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go Lo Mein

You know me, you know me, you know me
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (pow! pow!), you know me


Uh, young-young nigga, same OG
Stayin' low-key, stand ten toes deep
Both feet says G (says)
Maybe B says I'm a G
I'm a weakness, like The Weeknd
Smoking weed man
I beg your pardon?
It's true, the rumors that they start 'gone make us break apart
Assuming they've influenced all this sudden change of heart
The voice recording take off with the whole thing
'Mind them that they know me
No way you think if ever I decide to cut my hair like Abel
Just like Jaden Smith, I'll probably walk around all day with it
Okay, you lame, I'm a-okay with it
Might take the paper around my old ways
'Mind them that they know me


Cause, you know me, you know me
You know me, you know me
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (pow! pow!), you know me
