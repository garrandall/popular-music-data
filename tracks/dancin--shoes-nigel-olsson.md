Too many long conversations
And no one is hearin a word
Just tryin to escape the frustrations
Till a song in the night can be heard

Put on your dancin shoes
Throw out those one-night blues
Heres one to love and to chance
For a spin on that wheel of romance

Too slow to unriddle your problems
Too lonely for someone to care
Long, lonely silence keeps haunting
Till the song in the night finds you there

Put on your dancin shoes
Throw out those one-night blues
And here’s one to love and to chance
For a spin on that wheel, spin on that wheel
Spin on that wheel of romance

With a face like an angel
She’s waiting
She smiles and looks over at you
You yearn for the situation
Now finally your dreams have come true

Put on your dancin’ shoes
Sweep her away with you
And here’s one to love and to share
Caught on that wheel, caught on that wheel
Caught on that wheel of romance

Put on your dancin’ shoes (put on your dancin’ shoes)
Sweep her away with you
Put on your dancin’ shoes
Sweep her away with you, you, oh you
Put on your dancin’ shoes (put on your dancin’ shoes)
Oh, oh, oh
