How much is that doggie in the window
Ho, ho, ho, the one with the
Waggily, waggily tail, yeah

How much is that doggie in the window
Ho, ho, ho, I do hope that
Doggie's for sale, hey, yeah

I read in the papers
There are robbers
(I'm so afraid of robbers
In the night, you know)
With flashlights that shine
Shine in the dark
(I'm so afraid of being in the dark)

My love needs a
Doggie to protect her
(And you should protect
The thing you love, me)
And scare them away with one bark
(Arf, arf, hey, hey, hey)

How much (how much)
Is that doggie (is the doggie)
In the window (in the window)
Ho, ho, ho (I wanna know)

The one (the one)
With the waggily, waggily tail
(With the waggily, waggily tail)
Hey, hey, hey

How much (how much)
Is that doggie (is the doggie)
In the window (in the window)
Ho, ho, ho (I gotta know)
I do hope that doggie's for sale
(I hope the doggie's for sale)

How much (how much)
Is that doggie (is the doggie)
In the window (in the window)
Ho, ho, ho (I gotta know)

The one (the one)...
