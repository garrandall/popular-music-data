Oh, it's been such a long, long time
Looks like I'd get you off of my mind
Oh, but I can't, just the thought of you
Turns my whole world, misty blue
Oh honey, just the mention of your name
Turns the flicker to a flame
Listen to me good baby
I think of things we used to do
Then ah, my whole world turns misty blue
Oh baby I should forget you
Heaven knows I've tried
Baby, and when I say that I'm glad were through
Deep in my heart I know I've lied
I've lied, I've lied
Oh honey, it's been such a long, long time
Looks like I'd get you off of my mind
But I can't
Baby I can't just the thought of you
Then my whole world turns misty blue
Oh honey, I can't just the thought of you
My whole world turns misty blue
Oh, I can't just the thought of you my love
Oh; my whole world turns misty blue
