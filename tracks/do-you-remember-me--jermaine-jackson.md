Don't judge by what you see
There's a softer part of me
Girl, my life has been so cold
There were times I needed you so

Do you remember me
I'm the one who loved you long ago
Do you remember me
From the days when our hearts were young

Look deep into my eyes
There's a glow you'll recognize
Girl, I can't change the wrong that I've done
Time can't erease the love that we know

Do you remember me
I was the one
I was the one who loved you long ago
Do you remember me
From the days when our hearts were young
Do you remember me
I'm not a stranger, girl
More than just a member
Do you remember me

I was the one who was wrong no doubt about it
I was the one who broke all our dreams in two
I was the one who could lnever forget about you

Do you remember me
I was the one
I was the one who loved you long ago
Do you remember me
From the days when our hearts were young
Do you remember me
I'm not a stranger, girl
More than just a member
Do you remember me
