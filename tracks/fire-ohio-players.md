Hey, ha, uh-huh
Hey, hey, hey, Lord (ow, gow)
Hey, ha, uh-huh
Hey, hey, hey, Lord
(Fire)

Fire (Uh, uh)
Fire (Sing us home) (Oh Lord)
Fire (woo, woo, woo, woo)
Fire

The way you walk and talk really sets me off
To a four-alarm, child, yes it does, uh, uh
The way you squeeze and tease knocks to me my knees
'Cause you're smokin', baby, baby

The way you swerve and curve really wracks my nerves
And I'm so excited, child (yeah) woo, woo
The way you push, push lets me know that you're
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha, good
(You're gonna get your wish) Oh, Lord, oh

Fire (what I say, child, ow)
Fire (uh-huh)
Got me burnin', got me burnin' (woo)
Got me burnin', got me burnin' (no no)
Got me burnin', got me burnin' (whoa)

Woo hoo hoo hoo, baby
Says burnin, burnin' baby
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Burnin, burnin' baby
Oh, baby
'Cause someone on me

When you shake what you got, and girl, you've got a lot
You really somethin', child, yes, you are
'Cause when you're hot, you're hot, you really shoot your shot
You're dyn-o-mite child, yeah

Well, I can tell by your game, you're gonna start a flame
In my heart, baby, baby
I'm 'bout to choke from the smoke, got to tighten up my stroke
Can you feel it, girl? Yeah

Got me burnin', got me burnin'
Got me burnin', got me burnin'
Got me burnin', got me burnin' (fire)
Got me burnin', got me burnin' (fire)
Got me burnin', got me burnin' (fire)
Got me burnin', got me burnin' (fire)
Got me burnin', got me burnin' (fire)
