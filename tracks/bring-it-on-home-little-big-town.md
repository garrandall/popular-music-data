You got someone here wants to make it alright
Someone who loves you more than life right here
You got willing arms that'll hold you tight
A hand to lead you on through the night right here
I know your heart can get all tangled up inside
But don't you keep it to yourself


When your long day is over
And you can barely drag your feet
The weight of the world is on your shoulders
I know what you need
Bring it on home to me


You know I know you like the back of my hand
But did you know I'm going to do all that I can right here
I'm going to lie with you till you fall asleep
When the morning comes I'm still going to be right here (yes I am)
So take your worries and just drop them at the door
Baby leave it all behind

Baby let me be your safe harbor
Don't let the water come and carry you away

You got someone here wants to make it alright
Someone who loves you more than life right here
