Do do do do
Do do do wop wop...

You don't have to be pretty
You don't have to wear fine clothes
All you gotta is just walk along
And wiggle where it shows the most

Some girls are born with beauty
And others have fine clothes
But they think about their beauty
And they forget to wiggle
Where it shows the most

Do do do do
Do do do wop wop...

Some folks believe in beauty
Fine clothes and everything
You can put a wiggle in a shimmy sack
And really make the people scream

Now, listen to me, little girl
You're as cute as you can be
But forget all about your beauty, girl
And just wiggle, wiggle, wiggle for me

Do do do do
Do do do wop wop...
