I look out across corn rows from a dirt road 
Babys kicked back in the front seat 
Got her bare fit hanging out the window 

We take a trip down memory lane 
Dirt on the truck, no chance of rain 
My third generation farming friends all pray that its on the way 
And if it dont show up, we'll be alright 
Because folks round here wouldnt take a million 
For a different life 

Home sweet home 
I thank my lucky stars at night 
I was raised down here and raised up right 
And my pride, you've got that right 
Home sweet home 
Where a little bit goes long way 
And we shut her down on sundays 
I wont ever get too far away 
From Home sweet home 

Pull down to the cane bridge 
Park in the ditch 
Folks and poles are lined up 
A little kid holds a stringer up 
Got a mess of fish 
I drive away with a smile on my face 
Knowing that this place is blessed 
By God's amazing grace 

Home sweet home 
I thank my lucky stars at night 
I was raised down here and raised up right 
And my pride, you've got that right 
Home sweet home 
Where a little bit goes long way 
And we shut her down on sundays 
I wont ever get too far away 
From Home sweet home 

Know matter i go 
Or where the road might leave 
This little speck on the map, will always be 

Home sweet home 
I thank my lucky stars at night 
I was raised down here and raised up right 
And my pride, you've got that right 
Home sweet home 
Where a little bit goes long way 
And we shut her down on sundays 
I wont ever get too far away 
From Home sweet home... 

Yeah, I'm coming home.
