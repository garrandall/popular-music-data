Red roadside wildflower, if I had only picked you
Took you home set you on the counter
Oh, at least a time or two
Maybe she'd thought it through
Yellow sunset slowly dipping down in the rear view
Oh, how she'd love to sit and watch you
I could have done that a whole lot more

If I hadn't been so stubborn, been so selfish
Thought about her more, thought about me less
Joked to make her laugh, held her when she cried
A little more of that, maybe I wouldn't be

Driving like hell, flying like crazy down the highway
Calling everyone we know
Stopping any place she might be
Going any place she might go
Beating on the dash, screaming out her name at the windshield
Tears soaking up my face
If I'd 'a loved her this much all along
Maybe, maybe, yeah, maybe. She wouldn't be gone
She wouldn't be gone

She warned me it was comin'
Said if I didn't change, she was leaving
I just didn't believe she would ever really walk out,
God, I believe her now
Called her mama, cried like a baby to her best friend
If they've seen her, they ain't sayin'
They ain't sayin'

Now, I'm cursing like a fool, praying it ain't too late
All I wanna do is fix my mistakes
Find her, beg her for one more try
Until then, damn it, I'll be

Driving like hell, flying like crazy down the highway
Calling everyone we know
Stopping any place she might be
Going any place she might go
Beating on the dash, screaming out her name at the windshield
Tears soaking up my face
If I'd 'a loved her this much all along
Maybe, maybe, yeah, maybe. She wouldn't be gone
She wouldn't be gone

I wouldn't be beating on the dash
Screaming out her name at the windshield
Tears soaking up my face
If I'd 'a loved her this much all along
Maybe, maybe, yeah, maybe. She wouldn't be gone
She wouldn't be gone

Red roadside wildflower, if I had only picked you
Took you home set you on the counter
Oh, at least a time or two
Maybe she'd thought it through
