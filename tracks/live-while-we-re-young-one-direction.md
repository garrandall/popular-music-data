Hey girl, I'm waiting on you, I'm waiting on you
Come on and let me sneak you out
And have a celebration, a celebration
The music up, the window's down
Yeah, we'll be doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool and we know it too
Yeah, we'll keep doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool, so tonight


Let's go crazy, crazy, crazy 'til we see the sun
I know we only met but let's pretend it's love
And never, never, never stop for anyone
Tonight let's get some and live while we're young
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh)
And live while we're young
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Tonight let's get some
And live while we're young


Hey girl, it's now or never, it's now or never
Don't over-think, just let it go
And if we get together, yeah, get together
Don't let the pictures leave your phone, oh
Yeah, we'll be doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool, so tonight


Let's go crazy, crazy, crazy 'til we see the sun
I know we only met but let's pretend it's love
And never, never, never stop for anyone
Tonight let's get some and live while we're young
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Wanna live while we're young
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Tonight let's get some
And live while we're young


And girl, you and I
We're 'bout to make some memories tonight
I wanna live while we're young
We want to live while we're young


Let's go crazy, crazy, crazy 'til we see the sun ('Til we see the sun)
I know we only met but let's pretend it's love
And never, never, never stop for anyone (Anyone)
Tonight let's get some and live while we're young (Young)
Crazy, crazy, crazy 'til we see the sun
I know we only met but let's pretend it's love (It's love)
And never, never, never stop for anyone
Tonight let's get some (let's get some) and live while we're young
(Wanna live, wanna live, wanna live)
Come on, young
(Wanna live, wanna live, wanna live)
Wanna live while we're young
(Wanna live, wanna live, wanna live while we're young)
Tonight let's get some
And live while we're young
