Puzzled lips dipped in wine
Out to get this heart of mine
Candy kisses don't mean a thing
If only lies those kisses bring

Platinum hair, black at the roots
Short, short skirts and dirty boots
Have an act and that's surely a fact
To try to make my poor heart cry

Why pick on me
Why pick on me
Do you get your kicks when you see men cry
Why pick on me, yeah
Why pick on me
Is this the way I'll have to get your heart

If you choose to play the field
Then you choose to know how it feels
When somebody messes you up
When he thinks that you've had enough

Why pick on me
Why pick on me
Do you get your kicks when you see men cry
Why pick on me, yeah
Why pick on me
Is this the way I'll have to get your heart

Long hair up against my skin
But never once have you given in
To any one of my wants or needs
No matter how my poor heart bleeds

Why pick on me
Why pick on me
Do you get your kicks when you see men cry
Why pick on me, yeah
Why pick on me
Is this the way I'll have to get your heart

Does it feel good
Why pick on me, baby
Why pick on me
Do you get your kicks when you see me cry
Why pick on me, baby
Why pick on me
Do you get your kicks when you see me cry
