What more can I do, there's nothing I haven't tried
Still it's so hard for her to notice
I've tried hard to be straight
There's nothing left I can say
If only she would look my way


She don't know me, she don't know
She don't see me, she don't care
She can't hear me, she can't hear
Can not help me, she don't want
She don't want me like I want her
Like I wan't her got to tell her
Got to tell her that I love her
That I love her
She doesn't even know my name


I dream of when she'll be mine
I dream of crossing that line
And holding her so tender
Dreaming it could come true
So many things I would do
If only you'd give me a chance


She don't know me, she don't know
She don't see me, she don't care
She can't hear me, she can't hear
Can not help me, she don't want
She don't want me like I want her
Like I want her, got to tell her
Got to tell her that I love her
That I love her
She doesn't even know my name
