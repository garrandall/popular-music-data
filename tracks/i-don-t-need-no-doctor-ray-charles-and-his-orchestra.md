I don't need no doctor
'Cause I know what's ailing me
I don't need no doctor, no no
'Cause I know what's ailing me


I've been too long away from my baby, ah
I'm coming down with a misery


I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor


I don't need no doctor
For my prescription to be filled


I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor


I don't need no doctor, I tell you now
For my prescription to be filled


I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor


Only my baby's arms
Could ever take away this chill


I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor


Now the doctor say I need rest (Hey, hey)
Before I need her tenderness
Put me on the critical list (Hey, hey)
When all I need is her sweet kiss
He gave me a medicated lotion
But it didn't soothe (It didn't soothe)
My emotion


I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor


I don't need no doctor
For my hope to live is gone


I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor


I don't need no doctor, no no
For my hope to live is gone


I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor


All I need is my baby
Baby, please
Won't you please come on home


I don't need no doctor (You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
I don't need no doctor


I don't need no Aspirins (I don't need no doctor)
I don't need no lotion (I don't need no doctor)
I say, I don't need (I don't need no doctor)
No vitamin pills (I don't need no doctor)
I don't need (I don't need no doctor)
Yeah, no babysitter (I don't need no doctor)


All I need (I don't need no doctor)
All I need (I don't need no doctor)
Yeah, my baby child (I don't need no doctor)
I don't need no surgery (I don't need no doctor)
I don't need no implants (I don't need no doctor)
