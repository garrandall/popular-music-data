Whoa!
Lord have mercy
Ah, baby, c'mon


Yeah
How you doin', sweetheart?
It's been a long time since I don't see you and all that
But I must that man
This past few weeks
I've been somethin' else


So many times in life, I've been a fool
You couldn't tell me nothin', I was still cool
I played the games and I don't know why
I guess it's all a part of bein' a guy
Although the love comes straight from the heart
But the love I'm losin' you, girl, it's tearin' mine apart
I never though that I could miss you so much
Your beautiful smile, you go with the touch
I love you more than the day is long and the reason I'm feelin' like this is too strong
I wanna be the man that you want me to be
I'll change my lifestyle, no more in the street
And with the chest I promise I'll serve ya a love life that'll never die
So my hand and squeeze real tight
And make love, baby, all through the night


Love you, love you, baby
Nothin' just I do
(I wanna love you, baby)
Wanna be the only one, the only one for you
(I wanna be the only one for you, baby)
I wanna be the only one that goes and squeeze you tight
(I love it like that)
I wanna be the only you make up every night


Every night I fall asleep with you on my mind
The picture is perfect but I still seem blind
To the fact that all you wanted was me, Mr. Smith
Not Tone L-O-C
Sometimes a man never knows what he has, until a true lady of his past
 girl I can ever be with

Love is one thing, girl, that I can give you
And then due the respect I pay tribute
 a special kind of breathe
And the ones you've given me, I'm more than
With your manerism
