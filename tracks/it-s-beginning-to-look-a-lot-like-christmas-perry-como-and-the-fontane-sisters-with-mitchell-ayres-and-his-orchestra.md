It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look in the five-and-ten
Glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in, the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas,
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring,
Is the carol that you sing,
Right within your heart!

A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots,
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk,
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again!

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas,
Soon the bells will start,
And the thing that will make them ring,
Is the carol that you sing,
Right within your heart!
