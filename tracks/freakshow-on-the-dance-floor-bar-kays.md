Dance freaks move around
You know, get down
Dance freaks move around
You know, get down
It's like a freakshow, yeah, huh


Freakshow, baby, baby, on the dance floor
There's a freakshow
Freakshow, baby, baby, on the dance floor
It's just a freakshow


People, they come from miles around
To see the freaks on the floor throwing down
They're wearin' miniskirts, huh, and camisoles
Tight leather pants or nothing at all
You'll be dancing
(One on one)
Or two on two
They're dancing three on one 'cause they're writin' all rules
Face to face and cheek to cheek
They're dancing on the floor for all to see


Freakshow, baby, baby on the dance floor
There's a freakshow
When you're out on the floor
Freakshow, baby, baby on the dance floor
It's just a freakshow
Everywhere I go, yeah
Freakshow, baby, baby on the dance floor
There's a freakshow
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Freakshow, baby, baby on the dance floor
It's just a freakshow


Oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa oh, whoa oh oh
Everybody sing, say
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa oh, whoa oh oh


People, they come from everywhere
They stand in line every night just to be there
'Cause when the music starts and the show begins
You can see it all once you get in
You'll be dancing
(One on one)
Or two on two
They're dancing three on one
'Cause they're writin' all rules
Guys with guys, and chicks with chicks
No, it really doesn't matter, they just do it for the kicks, yeah


Freakshow, baby, baby on the dance floor
There's a freakshow
When they're out on the floor
Freakshow, baby, baby on the dance floor
It's just a freakshow
Let me tell you
Freakshow, baby, baby on the dance floor
There's a freakshow
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Freakshow, baby, baby on the dance floor
It's just a freakshow
Let me hear you sing, say
