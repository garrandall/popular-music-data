What's the use in breakin' up
When you just turn around and make up?

Oh you say you're tired and you're uninspired
And you wanna leave me, oh baby
The last time you felt that way
Girl, you left me for a whole day
Then you called me on the telephone (hey baby)
In your sweet and your softest tone (hey baby)
Askin' me "What should we do?"
When you know all the time that I'm crazy about you

What's the use in breakin' up
When you just turn around and make up?

What's the use in breakin' up
When you just turn around and make up?

We had the same conversation
Well it couldn't have been more than a week ago
I said "Darlin', you're breakin' my heart
And I don't see how I can take much more"
I got up and walked out of the door (hey baby)
Walked on down to the corner store (hey baby)
And by the time what I said took in
I turned right around and came back again

What's the use in breakin' up
When you just turn around and make up?

What's the use in breakin' up
When you just turn around and make up?

Girl, I guess we do it 'cause it's such a groove (hey baby)
To find somethin' that you need to use (hey baby)
Oh baby, I love you, I swear
And ain't neither one of us goin' nowhere

What's the use in breakin' up
When you just turn around and make up?

What's the use in breakin' up
When you just turn around and make up?

You know that you and I both started
And if we break up we will be broken hearted
Let on I've always loved you
And I think the whole world of you
