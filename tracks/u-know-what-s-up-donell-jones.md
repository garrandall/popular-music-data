Oh, say what, say what, say what
Oh, girl u know what's up
Oh, say what, say what, say what
Oh, girl u know what's up


Me and my niggas be rollin'
Schemin' on u and your homies
The very first day of summer
All chromed out in a Hummer, babe
Hit the park and parlay
Hopin' that u walk this way
Do u and your girls wanna ride
Play all day and puff on the la


Oh, say what, say what, say what
Oh, girl u know what's up
Oh, say what, say what, say what
Oh, girl u know what's up

I'm diggin' u and I'm feelin' u
U know what's up
Said i'm diggin' u and I'm wantin' u
So tell me what's up


Peep her thighs and I'm zonin'
Right around two in the mornin'
Lookin' fly with a sundress on
Think I feel a bone comin on
Girl u got it wide open
Want all day and in hopin'
Baby don't front
Back seat Jeep, u know what I want





So baby tell me what's up
Can we ascend to higher heights
And when the path gets rough
We can give in to brighter nights
Breathe with peace, expand by leaps
Sow to reap our souls to keep
The passions deep and filled with heat
Living this life on the hustle
I barely get enough time
U know me for the Platinum
How I stack them and shine
U see a lot of contenders
They try to end up in my world
A reputation known as the untouchable girl
I'm movin' on and now I'm tryin'
To make a change in my ways
Be the best that I can be
To last me all of my days
Now we can blaze pathways
Or just take our time
Better hollar if you hear me
Cuz Left-Eye gonna shine
My eyes don't lie see how
They glisten when you pass me by
U and I don't need permission to be unified
Surely I done seen and heard of many places
Then I traveled around the world, seen many faces
don't let another one get near me if you wanna be true
And show me that nobody else can do it better than you
So if you serious, I'm curious to see what you got
My love is furious, cuz I believe in blowin' up spots
