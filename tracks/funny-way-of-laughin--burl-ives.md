It's just my funny way of laughin'
Yes, my funny way of laughin'
Your leavin' didn't bother me
It's just my funny way of laughin'
Yes, my funny way of laughin'
I'm really happy as can be

If you see me with a great big smile
At some party where the fun runs wild
If tears start to flow and I fall apart
Please don't think you broke my heart

It's just my funny way of laughin'
Yes, my funny way of laughin'
Your leavin' didn't bother me
It's just my funny way of laughin'
Yes, my funny way of laughin'
I'm really happy as can be

If we meet on the street
And a little bitta tear rolls down my cheek
Please don't think it's because I'm blue
Or that I'm still in love with you

It's just my funny way of laughin'
Yes, my funny way of laughin'
Your leavin' didn't bother me
It's just my funny way of laughin'
Yes, my funny way of laughin'
I'm really happy as can be

Remember the day you left our place
And how the tears rolled down my face
It wasn't because you were leavin' me
I was happy because you were pleasing me

It's just my funny way of laughin'
Yes, my funny way of laughin'
Your leavin' didn't bother me
It's just my funny way of laughin'
Yes, my funny way of laughin'
I'm really happy as can be

Funny way of laughin', laughin'
Funny way of laughin', laughin'
Funny way of laughin', laughin'
