Dance, Boogie Wonderland, hey, hey
Dance, Boogie Wonderland

Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts of men
Who need more than they get
Daylight deals a bad hand to a woman
Who has laid too many bets

The mirror stares you in the face and says
"Baby, uh, uh, it don't work"
You say your prayers though you don't care
You dance and shake the hurt

Dance, Boogie Wonderland, hey, hey
Dance, Boogie Wonderland

Sound fly through the night
I chase my vinyl dreams to Boogie Wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in Boogie Wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in Boogie Wonderland

All the love in the world can't be gone
All the need to be loved can't be wrong
All the records are playing and my heart keeps saying
"Boogie Wonderland, Wonderland"

Dance, Boogie Wonderland, hey, hey
Dance, Boogie Wonderland, hey, hey

I find romance when I start to dance in Boogie Wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in Boogie Wonderland
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance

Wonderland, Wonderland

All the love in the world can't be gone
All the need to be loved can't be wrong
All the records are playing and my heart keeps saying
Boogie Wonderland, Wonderland

Dance, Boogie Wonderland, hey, hey
Dance, Boogie Wonderland, hey, hey

I find romance when I start to dance in Boogie Wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in Boogie Wonderland
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
