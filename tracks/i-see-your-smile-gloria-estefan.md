I get a little tongue twisted
Every time I talk to you, when I see you
And I'm so glad that you just missed it
The way I stare to memorize your face
To kiss you in my mind
Love you all the time

Cause when I close my eyes
I still can see your smile
Its bright enough to light my life
Out of my darkest hour
Please believe its true
When I tell you I love you

I've taken too many chances
Searching for the truth of love, that's in my heart
Tell me if I've made the wrong advances
Tell me if I've made you feel ashamed

Cause I know I have to do this
Would you hold my hand right through it

Cause when I close my eyes
I still can see your smile
Its bright enough to light my life
Out of my darkest hour
Please believe its true
When I tell you I Love you

Had to let you just what would happen
Yes I had to let you know the truth

I know I've got to do this
Would you hold my hand right through it
Would you
Cause when I close my eyes
I still can see your smile
Its bright enough to light my life
Out of my darkest hour
Cause when I close my eyes
I still can see your smile

Its bright enough to light my life
Out of my darkest hour

You know now this is true
When I tell you I love you
