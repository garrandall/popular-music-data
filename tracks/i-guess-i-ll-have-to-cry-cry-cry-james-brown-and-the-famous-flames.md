My cup is running over
Don't know what to do
My cup is running over
Don’t know what to do
No, I don't know
No, I don't know


Guess I gotta cry, cry, cry
Go let me cry, cry, cry
I’d feel a little bit better
If I cry
I gotta cry, cry, cry


My cup is overflowing
Don't know what to do
My cup is overflowing
Don't know what to do
No, I don't know
No, I don't know


I guess I gotta cry, cry, cry
People, let me cry, cry, cry
I'd feel a little bit better
If I cry, cry, cry


When I, lost you
I lost the best friend I ever had
Now that I, I realize
It makes me, oh, it makes me
It makes me so sad


'Cause my cup is running over
I don't know what to do
My cup is running over
I don’t know what to do
No, I don’t know
No, I don't know


Guess I gotta cry, cry, cry
People, let me cry, cry, cry
I’d feel a little bit better
Just let me cry, cry, cry


I guess I got to cry
Oh, I feel so hurt now
I'm so disheartened
Baby, have mercy on me
Oh, oh, oh Lord
People, let me cry
I'm not ashamed
I'm not, I’m not ashamed
I gotta walk away now
Just let me walk away
Oh, oh
