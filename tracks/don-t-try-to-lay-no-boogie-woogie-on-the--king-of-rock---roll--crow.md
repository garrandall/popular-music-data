Don't you tell me n-n-n-no lies woman cause all you know I've told
Don't sell me no alibi sister cause all you've got I've sold
You better leave that midnight sneaking to the one who worked it out
I don't wanna hear no back talk speaking go on and shut yer mouth
And everything's gonna work out tight if you act like you been told
So don't try to lay no boogie woogie on the king of rock and roll

Don't you feed me no TV dinners when you know I'm used to steak
I don't need no rank beginners when it's time to shake that shake
You better pull your thing together, reach in and dust it out
And if ya feel that yer ass can't dig it then I guess you know the route
It ain't a matter of pork 'n beans gonna justify your soul
Just don't try to lay no boogie woogie on the king of rock and roll

You weren't alive when I started to drive, so don't put none on me
You didn't arrive 'til late '45 but your head's in '53
You got what it takes to keep the heads a-spinning down by the old rim shack
And you come across just like a fool grinning in the back of a red Cadillac
You can't come across the Astrobridge until you pay the toll
So don't try to lay no boogie woogie on the king of rock and roll
