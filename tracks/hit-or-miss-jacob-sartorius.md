I heard that life gets hard when you're older
And the fun stuff's just for kids
But what I realize as I grow up
Is that it's just a hit or miss

So let's not worry about tomo, mo mo, nah-nah, nah-nah
We all good, baby, we alright
So let's not worry about tomo, mo mo, nah-nah, nah-nah
We all good, baby, we alright

Let's not worry about tomo, mo mo, nah-nah, nah-nah
We all good, baby, we alright
So let's not worry about tomo, mo mo, nah-nah, nah-nah
We all good, baby, we alright

How, how you doing? Girl, tell me what it do
I see you with your friends but I'm tryna kick it with you
Thought you already knew, but you didn't
I'm tryna roll with you so I can show you how we livin'

And I've been on a mission tryna take you to the dance floor
We go up like NASA to the places that they can't go
But what's your name though? Didn't even ask her
These other girls fake, I see through them like Casper
Get, get

'Cause, girl, you got me thinking we could really do it
This could be our chance I don't wanna lose it
If you don't think I care 'bout you I'ma prove it
And by the way, I really like the way you move it

So let's keep going, don't gotta stop
Please don't worry about tomorrow, we just live it up
I know that there used to be girls in the past, but I forgot
Now you the only one all up in my thoughts

I heard that life gets hard when you're older
And the fun stuff's just for kids
But what I realized as I grow up
Is that it's just a hit or miss

So let's not worry about tomo, mo mo, nah-nah, nah-nah
We all good, baby, we alright
So let's not worry about tomo, mo mo, nah-nah, nah-nah
We all good, baby, we alright

Let's not worry about tomo, mo mo, nah-nah, nah-nah
We all good, baby, we alright
So let's not worry about tomo, mo mo, nah-nah, nah-nah
We all good, baby, we alright

What you thinking? I think I need some Blues Clues
Losing my mind just to make sure I don't lose you
So please just let me know, my heart's a metronome
And if it stops beating then that means I'll let you go

And now you know I'm glad I met you though
Because the second we connected, girl, our love is so electrical
And, yeah, you way above the typical
So come with me and we can make it 'cause you never know
Get, get

'Cause, girl, you got me thinking we could really do it
This could be our chance I don't wanna lose it
If you don't think I care 'bout you I'ma prove it
And by the way, I really like the way you move it

So let's keep going, don't gotta stop
We ain't worried 'bout tomorrow, we just live it up
I never be thinking 'bout those other girls, you all I got
It's a hit or miss, come on, baby, take a shot

I heard that life gets hard when you're older
And the fun stuff's just for kids
But what I realized as I grow up
Is that it's just a hit or miss

So let's not worry about tomo, mo mo, nah-nah, nah-nah
We all good, baby, we alright
So let's not worry about tomo, mo mo, nah-nah, nah-nah
We all good, baby, we alright

Let's not worry about tomo, mo mo, nah-nah, nah-nah
We all good, baby, we alright
So let's not worry about tomo, mo mo, nah-nah, nah-nah
We all good, baby, we alright
