Oh, yeah, oh yeah
Uh, yeah

I been contemplating, meditating
Should have waited
Should have never dated
You seem irritated
Baby, why you never say it?
Isn't this worth saving?
I can feel you fading off
We're not gonna make it long
Guess you can not take it
Guess it's worth saying

It's none of your concern anymore
None of your concern
Is it even worth it at all?
Is it even worth it?
Is it gonna work anymore?
Is it gonna work?
Am I being heard anymore?
Am I being heard?

I been hearing things and seeing things
And so it seems you're moving on from me
Caught you on the scene
With little miss thing
And trust me, she really don't want beef
That's besides the point
I'm disappointed as a homie
What is it you see?
I want better for you, moving forward
What's better for you than me?

Guess that's none of my concern anymore
None of my concern
It ain't even worth it no more
It ain't even worth it
It don't even hurt anymore
It don't even hurt
It ain't gonna work anymore
It ain't gonna work

You been hearing things and seeing things
And so it seems I'm moving on my own
The audacity to question me
Like you ain't leave me out here on my own
I was traumatised and suicidal
Sick and tired, I am not to blame
Once I felt a way but not today
I'm not afraid now I can say

Get your bitch ass off of my phone
Please leave me alone
I am not your girl anymore
You need to watch your tone
Don't worry about who it is I'm fucking
Or who I am loving
Just know that it is not you
This isn't up for discussion
I wish you good luck man
When it comes to you

It's none of my concern anymore
None of my concern
I know that I'm deserving of more
I know what I deserve
Not scared to be alone anymore
Not scared to be alone
It don't even hurt anymore
It don't even hurt

You know I had these issues when you met me
Results of the post damages that I haven't dealt with
And I only want the best for you moving forward
But you back tracking with niggas that ain't shit for you
Don't belong around your aura
No, there's not a day in these modern times
You haven't crossed my mind, we both crossed the line
Seems like I needed you more than I needed myself
Just like I always felt like cheating on you would be cheating myself
To me that's just some dumb shit for you to say we done with
Tryna speak your heart, tryna make your mark
Then go deeper and make a scar
But every time I lay down, I think about you naked
And if you find my replacement, how could you?
I made you cum 9 times in one day
Your two lips should come in a vase
You rode my face, I realized you look as good as you taste
Fingers all in your mouth, I'm grabbing you up
And dicking you down and grabbing your waist
Your room is my only escape
I guess that's none of your concern
