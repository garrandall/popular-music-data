You wined me and dined me when I was your girl
Promised if I'd be your wife
You'd show me the world
But all I've seen of this old world is a bed and a doctor bill
I'm tearing down your brooder house
'Cause now I've got the pill

All these years I've stayed at home
Wwhile you had all your fun
And every year that's gone by
Another baby's come
There`s gonna be some changes
Made right here on Nursery Hill
You`ve set this chicken your last time
'Cause now I've got the pill

This old maternity dress I've got
Is going in the garbage
The clothes I'm wearing from now on
Won`t take up so much yardage
Miniskirts hotpants and a few little fancy frills
Yeah, I`m making up for all those years since I've got the pill

I'm tired of all your crowing
How you and your hens play
While holding a couple in my arms
Another's on the way

This chicken`s done tore up her nest
And I'm ready to make a deal
And you can`t afford to turn it down
'Cause you know I've got the pill

This incubator is overused
Because you've kept it filled
The feeling good comes easy
Now since I've got the pill

It's getting dark
It`s roosting time
Tonight's too good to be real
Aw, but Daddy don`t you worry none
'Cause Mama's got the pill
Oh, Daddy don't you worry none
'Cause Mama's got the pill
