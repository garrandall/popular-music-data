I know you want this for life
Taking pictures with all my ice
But I can't have no wife
I just want you for the night
I know you want this for life
Taking pictures with all my ice
But I can't have no wife
I just want you for the night (just for the night)

I know you want this for life
Fuck you so good you be calling out the Christ (oh my God)
Bottles of the Tech got it laid on ice
We spent four seasons at the Four Seasons twice
You be calling all your homegirls like "I'm his wife"
Hell nah, you trippin', reevaluate your life
I can't love no bitch, every single hoe is trife
I sip dirty Sprite just to get me through the night
But I need you there (I need you there)
Promise that I need you there
Ain't no other bitch gon' fuck me like you do, I swear
Put that on my gang I swear
I just can't put you on front street like you want I know
But baby you is not no hoe
And I put it on my gang I'm not no average joe (average joe)
It's Yachty from the block you know

I know you want this for life
Taking pictures with all my ice
But I can't have no wife
I just want you for the night
I know you want this for life
Taking pictures with all my ice
But I can't have no wife
I just want you for the night
