Your used to be, that's me, that's me
I was your was, she is your is
It plain to see I'm not your now
Oh, pity me
For I've become your used to be

Everytime you kiss me it tastes just like goodbye
And I can tell that my best friends the reason why
When were out together you say there's nothing wrong
But when she's with us, you're with her
And I'm just a tag along

Your used to be, that's me, that's me
I was your was, she is your is
It plain to see I'm not your now
Oh, pity me
For I've become your used to be

When I introduced you I made my first mistake
I loved you both and both of you made my heart break
Like muskateers we always roamed about
But like they say three's a crowd
And I'm getting crowed out

Your used to be, that's me, that's me
I was your was, she is your is
It plain to see I'm not your now
Oh, pity me
For I've become your used to be
For I've become your used to be
