Funny, but when I pass your door
I don't hurt like before
Really, I think I'm over you

It's funny, but when I
Hear them speak your name
This little heart no
No, no, no, no longer pains
Like it did the day
You said we were through

I loved you, oh, so long
I wondered what went wrong
You shattered my dreams
Yes, you hurt my pride

My love you threw away
All I could do was pray
But, darling, you
You didn't care how I cried

Funny, but when I
Meet you on the street
My little heart no
No, no, no, no
Longer skips a beat
Like it did the day
You said we were through

It's funny, I think
I've gotten over you
