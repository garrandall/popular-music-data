I'm leaving you, darling
And I won't be back
I found something better
Somewhere down the track

Oh, oh, I need you, darling
You've got the power of love
You've got the power in your hands
You've got the power to make me understand
Oh, oh, I want you to try me
You've got the power of love

I told you, darling
That I would stand by your side
Remember the days you made me cry
But, oh, darling, oh, my little darling
You've got the power to love

We belong together
And we love each other
We belong together
And, darling, you know I don't
Have to look no further 'cause

You've got the power
(I need you, darling) in your hands
(Oh, yes you have)
You've got the power
To make me understand (yes you have)
You've got the power
You've got the power
You've got the power
You've got the power
You've got the power
