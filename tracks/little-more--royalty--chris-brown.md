Wake me up before you go,
Oh, I need a little more
Just a little more, a little more of your love

Wake me up before you go,
Oh, I need a little more
Just a little more, a little more of your love

Oh, I need a jumpstart,
When you call me, I'm running to ya
Gimme a headstart,
Thank God, gonna have me like hallelujah

Even though I'm a man, girl, you making me feel like a baby
Oh, girl, when you lay in my arms, I'll take advantage of the moment
Girl, the way you make me smile is the definition of a real lady

So before I go to work, can I ask you for a favor?

Wake me up before you go,
Oh, I need a little more
Just a little more, a little more of your love

Wake me up before you go,
Oh, I need a little more
Just a little more, a little more of your love

'Cause your love, your love, your love
Wake me up with some more of your love
'Cause your love, your love, your love
Wake me up with some more of your love

Oh, I need a back talk,
Girl, I'm your daddy, no sass talk
Oh, baby girl, you inspire me, give me the reason to keep on

My baby, my Royalty,
Girl, you're the lyrics to my song
Girl, you got this heart lock on me,
I don't think I can control it

I hold on with all my might
While you look at me in my eye
Like a vitamin you put back my energy,
You're making me stronger, bring out the best of me

So before I go to work, can I ask you a favor?

Wake me up before you go,
Oh, I need a little more
Just a little more, a little more of your love
Wake me up before you go,
Oh, I need a little more
Just a little more, a little more of your love

'Cause your love, your love, your love
Wake me up with some more of your love
'Cause your love, your love, your love
Wake me up with some more of your love
