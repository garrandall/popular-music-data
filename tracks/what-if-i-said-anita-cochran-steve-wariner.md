We've been friends for a long long time
You tell me your secrets and I tell you mine
She's left you all alone and you feel like no one cares
But I have never failed you,  I've always been there


You tell your story, it sounds a bit like mine
It's the same old situation it happens every time
Can't we see oh maybe you and me
Is what's meant to be
Or do we disagree



What if I told you

What if I said

That I love you
How would you feel
What would you think
What would we do
Do we dare to cross that line
Between your heart and mine

Or would I lose a friend

Or find a love that would never end

What if I said



She doesn't love you
Oh it's plain to see
I can read between the lines of what you're telling me

He doesn't hold you the way a woman should be held
How long can I go on keeping these feelings to myself



So what if I told you

What if I said

That I love you
How would you feel
What would you think
What would we do
Do we dare to cross that line
Between your heart and mine

Or would I lose a friend

Or find a love that would never end

What if I said



Oh we've both had our share of loneliness

So who's to say that we can't have a little happiness

And if I found that in you

It would make my dreams come true

Or would you walk away

Hear what I have to say



What if I told you

What if I said

That I love you
How would you feel
What would you think
What would we do

Oh do we dare to cross that line

Between your heart and mine

I've always wondered
From that day that we met

What if I said



What if I said

Ohhh oh
What if I said
