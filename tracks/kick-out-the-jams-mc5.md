Kick out the jams, mother fuckers!
Yea!
I, I, I, I, I'm gonna
I'm gonna kick 'em out!
Yea!

Well, I feel pretty good
And I guess that I could
Get crazy now, baby
'Cause we all got in tune and when the
Dressing room got hazy now, baby

I know how you want it, child:
Hot, sweet, and tight
The girls can't stand it when you
Doin' it right
When you're up on the stand

And let me kick out the jams, yes!
Kick out the jams
I wantta kick 'em out!

Yes, I'm startin' to sweat
You know my shirt's all wet
What a feelin'

And the sound that abounds and
Resounds and rebounds off the ceiling
You gotta have it baby
You can't do without
When you get the feelin'
You got the sound above
Put that mike in my hand

And let me kick out the jams, yes!
Kick out the jams
I wantta kick 'em out!

Alright, alright, alright...
Come on, come on, come on

So you gotta get it up
You know ya
Can't get enough, miss Mackenzie
Well, it gets in your brain
It drives you insane with a frenzy

The wailing guitars, girl
The crash of the drums
Makes me wanna keep a-rockin' till the
Morning comes

Let me be who I am
And let me kick out the jams, yes!
Kick out the jams
I done kicked 'em out!
