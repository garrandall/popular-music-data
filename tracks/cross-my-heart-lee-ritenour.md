You ask me all about my past
My other love affairs
Cause you're not sure
That this love will last
Or if I'd ever leave you
You saw me with another girl
You think that I'm untrue
For all the gold that's in the world
I will never trade your love

Cross my heart
I'd never deceive you
So cross my heart
I will never tell you lies

Can't you see?
You're the only one
Why don't you believe in me?
But I don't know
What you think I've done
I can look you in the eyes

Cross my heart
I'd never deceive you
So cross my heart
I will never leave your love

Cross my heart
I'd never deceive you
So cross my heart
I will never tell you lies

You don't have to worry 'bout me
No-one is this world
Could make me want to
Put my love into jeopardy
Nothing in this world
Could take my heart away

Cross my heart
Cross my heart
I will never tell you lies
Cross my heart
Try to believe me
So cross my heart
I will never leave your love
Cross my heart
I will always love you
So cross my heart
I will never tell you lies
Cross my heart...
