The road is long with many awaiting turns
That lead us to who knows where,
Who knows where
But I'm strong,
Strong enough to carry him
He ain't heavy, he's my brother

So long we go
His welfare is my concern
No burden is he to bare, we'll get there

For I know
He would not encumber me
He ain't heavy, he's my brother

If Im laden at all,
I I am laden with sadness that
Everyone's heart isn't filled with the gladness
I am alone for one and other

It's so long long road
From which there is no return
While we're on the way to live why not share

And the load doesn't weigh me down at all
He ain't heavy, he's my brother

He's my brother
He ain't heavy
He's my brother
He's my brother
He ain't heavy
He's my brother
