Baby Girl
Alright now
Ooo Lord, Lord, Lord
Are you ready for this, yeah


Whenever I got no money
She is still my honey
There is a reason to be funny
Cuz, cuz, cuz I said
I don't care what they say
But you can say girl
Keep on sayin your thing, yeah
And I don't care what they do
But you can do girl
Keep on doin your thing, yeah
And I don't care what they shake
But you can shake girl
Keep makin my head spin, yeah
And I don't care what you kiss
But you can kiss, yeah
You hear this brother sing that
People keep on tellin me that you are here to stay
Brother keep on tellin them that you will go away
Cuz, wha, two wrongs can't make no right, naw
Ain't nothin wrong with a voodoo fad


It's alright
If you feel it boy (Feel it, feel it)
You can feel this feelin all around the world
It's ok (Ooo, na na)
If you feel it
Forget everything and everybody
Boy, let's just have a parting, me and you


You moan, baby, moan, you call me dark man
Instead of bringing joy
You brought me great pain
And now I really know who teach the game, game
Must you bring, pain
Must you stay, stay
Sometime, I thought you're love was so true, true
Carryin on my shoulder you're tattoo
Now I really know what drugs will do, do
Forget you too, too
You won your crew, crew
People keep on tellin me your love is here to stay
Brother keep on tellin them that you will go away
Cuz, wha, two wrongs ain't no right
Ain't nothin wrong with a voodoo fad


It's alright (It's alright now)
If you feel it boy
You can feel this feelin all around the world (uh, hu)
It's ok (It's ok)
If you feel it (Ooo, na na)
Forget everything and everybody (Yeah)
Boy, let's just have a parting, me and you (Wha)


Whenever I got no money, no money
She is still my honey, my honey
Can't buy her any clothes or jewelry, yeah
She is still my honey, my honey
But yous never call or nothin, yeah
I must lose my money
Open your heart girl, open you heart
And let me back in
And you be a queen
And I forever your king
Cuz, two wrongs ain't no right


It's alright (It's alright)
If you feel it boy (Alright now)
You can feel this feelin all around the world (Ooo, na na)
It's ok (It's ok now)
If you feel it (Ooo, Lord)
Everything and everybody
Let's just have a parting, me and you (Me and you, downhill for two, we go together)
Forget everything and everybody, let's just have a parting, me and you
(Let's just have a aprting, let's just have  a parting)
Forget everything and everybody, boy, let's just have a parting, me and you
(Let's have a parting now, now)
