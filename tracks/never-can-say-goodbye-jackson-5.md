I never can say goodbye
(No, no, no, no, I)
I never can say goodbye, no

Even though the pain and heartaches
Seem to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seems to show

Then you try to say you're leaving me
And I always have to say no
Tell me why is it so that

I never can say goodbye, no
(No, no, no, no, I)
I never can say goodbye

Every time I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right through the core
It says, "Turn around, you fool
You know you love her more and more"
Tell me why is it so

I don't wanna let go
I can't say goodbye
Whoa, I, I never say goodbye
(Never can say goodbye)
(No matter how I try)

I never can say goodbye, no
(No, no, no, no, I)
I never can say goodbye

I keep thinking that our problems
Soon gonna all gonna work out
There's that same unhappy feeling
That makes that anguish, twist that doubt
It's what that same old dizzy hangup
Can do with you all the time
Tell me why is it so

I don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye
Oh, I, I never say goodbye
(Never gonna say goodbye)
(No matter how I try)

I'll never, never gonna say goodbye, girl
Ooh, baby, I'll never say goodbye
(Never gonna say goodbye)
(No matter how I try)

Don't wanna let you go
I can't say goodbye
See, I need you so
I never say goodbye
(Never gonna say goodbye)
(No matter how I try)

I'll never say goodbye
Ooh, baby, I'll never say goodbye
(Never gonna say goodbye)
(No matter how I try)

I ain't gonna let you go
I can't say goodbye
I need you so, oh, yeah
(Never gonna say goodbye)
(No matter how I try)

Can't get it out of my mind
I can't say goodbye
I want you all the time
I can't say goodbye
(Never gonna say goodbye)
(No matter how I try)

You're my one and only lover
I can't say goodbye
Don't wanna another
I can't say goodbye
