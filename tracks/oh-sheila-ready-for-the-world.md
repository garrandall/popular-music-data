Like they always say, what's good for the goose
Is always good for the gander
Oh Sheila


Oh, baby, love me right
Let me love you till we get it right
Why can't you let the others be
Cause with you is where I got to be

Oh, suga, where you been?
Hangin' out with your male friends
Listen, somebody's gonna hurt you
The way you love to keep hurting me


And we sing
Oh, oh Sheila
Let me love you till the morning comes
Oh, oh Sheila
You know I want to be the only one


Oh, baby, understand
That I want to be the only man
But it seems as though it's getting too hard
And I think I'll start to have my own fun

Oh, baby, it's plain to see
That you're qualified to fill your needs
You think you've pulled one over on me
Well honey, baby, just you wait and see


And we sing
Oh, oh Sheila
Let me love you till the morning comes
(The sun is set)
Oh, oh Sheila
You know I want to be the only one
For her


Oh, baby, it's 1 2 3
I love you, baby from A to C
I want to di-da di-da-li
A di-da-li-da-loo

Oh, oh Sheila
Uh, uh, uh
Oh, Sheila
Oh, oh Sheila
Uh, uh, uh
Oh, Sheila


Oh, baby, love me right
Let me love you till we get it right
Why can't you let the others be
Cause with you is where I wanna be, yeah

Oh, baby, it's plain to see
That you're qualified to fill your needs
You think you've pulled one over on me
Well honey, baby, just you wait and see


And we sing
Oh
Oh Sheila
Oh, oh Sheila
Let me love you till the morning comes
(The sun is set)
Oh, oh Sheila
You know I want to be the only one

Oh, oh Sheila
Let me love you till the morning comes
Oh, oh Sheila
You know I want to be the only one
And we sing
Oh
