All alone I sit
Looking out of the window
And the rain just keeps coming on down

Well, I cry to myself
So many things that I have done wrong
Now I'm watching you
Walk out

There goes my baby
Moving on down the line
Wonder where
Wonder where
Wonder where he is bound

I broke his heart
And I made him cry
Now I'm alone
So all alone
What can I do
What can I do

What can I do
Said I'll sing this sad, sad song

Oh yeah, I broke his heart
And I made him cry
Now I'm alone
So all alone
What can I do
What can I do

Where is he going?
How is he?
What is he going through
Where is he going?
And what on earth could he be going through

Oh, there goes my baby
Moving on down the line
Wonder where
Wonder where
Wonder where he is bound

I broke his heart
And I made him cry
Now I'm alone
So all alone
What can I do
What can I do

Where is he going?
How is he?
What is he going through
Where is he going?
And what on earth could he be going through

Oh, there goes my baby
Moving on down the line, oh yeah baby
Come on come

I broke his heart
And I made him cry
Now I'm alone
So all alone
What can I do
What can I do

Sing this song forever
Till we're back together
Oh, oh, oh
