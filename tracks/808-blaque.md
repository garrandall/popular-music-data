Oh (yea yea yea yea)
Oh (yea yea yea yea)
Oh (yea yea yea yea)


Check it out
See what I believe is
We was granted the power
What's that? Power, wha
Ha, the power to make you dance
Like this


I heard she's got a 9 to 5 (yea yea yea yea)
But comin' in after 12 (check it out)
I know they're tired of her lies (yea yea yea)
Just let her go, what the deal? (wha wha wha wha)
(wha wha wha)
And now take me for instance babe (uh huh)
See my love will drive her crazy


'Cause I'll be goin' boom like an 808
Be makin' circles like a figure 8
You know it feels good from head to toe
Now hold on to me baby here we go

You'll be goin' boom baby boom baby boom
And I'll be goin' oh baby oohaby ohoh
(check it out)


I heard she's not all that to you
Cause she can't do it like I do (ha ha ha)
So put that trophy on the shelf (wha wha wha wha)
Go about and find somebody else
Now take me for instance babe
See my love will drive her crazy (wha wha yeah)



You'll be goin' boom baby boom baby boom
And I'll be goin' oh baby oohaby ohoh

Cause I'll be goin' boom like an 808...


Ain't nobody can bang it like me
Stack it like me, wouldn't like me
Ask Kelly, his original plan
To get as large on the map, by makin' you clap your hands
Damn shoo bizzatch, I'm not gonna lie
I'll pump my amps to this
Cutie pie, honey bunch
If you're not busy take me to lunch
Oh, ya'll done did it now, with the luscious music
World poppin' crews, and what, 8-0 grooves
Is what intended, you to get me up you
You one in a mill, forget the mens
Cause they ride in my pockets baby
And today I just wanna
Jiggle my ball
Bet I knock your socks off
Wit' my what what what (wha wha wha wha)
Yea yea


Boom like an 808
Circles like a figure 8
Feels good from head to toe
To me baby here we go



You'll be goin' boom baby boom baby boom
And I'll be goin' oh baby oohaby ohohheck it out)

Cause I'll be goin' boom like an 808...
