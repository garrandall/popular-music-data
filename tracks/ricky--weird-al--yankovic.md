 Hey Lucy, I'm home

 Oh Ricky, you're so fine
 You're so fine you blow my mind
 Hey Ricky, hey Ricky

 Oh Lucy, you're so fine
 You're so fine you blow my mind
 Hey Lucy, hey Lucy

 Oh Ricky, you're so fine
 You play your bongos all the time
 Hey Ricky, hey Ricky

 Oh Lucy, you're so fine
 How I love tyo hear you whine
 Hey Lucy

 Hey Ricky
 You always play your conga drums, you think you got the right
 You wake up little Ricky in the middle of the night
 Stop shakin' your maraccas now and just turn out the light Ricky

 I'm sick of Fred and Ethel always comin' over here
 'Cause Fred eats all our pretzel sticks and then he spills his beer
 Why don't you serve your cassarole and make them disappear Lucy

 Oh Ricky, what's a girl like me supposed to do
 You really drive me wild when you sing your babaloo
 Oh Lucy, you're so dizzy, don't you have a clue
 Well, here's to you Lucy
 I love you too Lucy, too Lucy, let's babaloo Lucy

 Hey Ricky
 You're always playin' at the club, you never let me go
 I'm beggin' and I'm pleadin' but you always tell me no
 Oh, please honey please, let me be in your show Ricky, wah

 You always burn the roast and you drop the dishes too
 You iron my new shirt and you burn a hole right through
 You're such a crazy redhead I just don't know what to do Lucy

 Oh Ricky
 What a pity, don't you understand
 That every day's a rerun and the laughter's always canned
 Oh Lucy
 I'm the latin leader of the band
 So here's to you Lucy
 Let's babaloo Lucy, too Lucy
 Everybody rumba!

 Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
