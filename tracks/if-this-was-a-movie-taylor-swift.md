Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on the stairs
Six months gone, I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

So come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happened
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them, 
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me, 
That "Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
Then before I knew how much I had to lose"
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

If you're out there
If you're somewhere
If you're moving on
I'll be waiting for you
Ever since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just want to see you back at my front door

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You did before you say it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I locked you out
But I take it all back now
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

You'd be here by now
Come back, come back, come back to me
Come back, come back, come back to me
You'd be here right now
