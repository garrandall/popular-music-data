The sun comes up
The moon goes down
A new day's on it's way

The stars in the sky
Are waving goodbye
And morning's here
Bringing in the day

Then the kids start to shout
Mother and Father, get up
And here's the sun

Light sings
All over the world
Light sings
All over the world

Light sings
All over the world
Light sings
All over the world
Light sings

The night is gone
The light has come
A new day has begun

The weather is clear
And people are here
And morning's here
Calling everyone

Then the kids start to shout
Brothers and sisters, come out
Into the sun

Light sings
All over the world
Light sings
All over the world

(Let me tell you that)
Light sings (yes, it do now)
All over the world
(Oh, yeah) light sings
All over the world

(Would you believe that)
Light sings (yeah)
(I know) light sings
(Come on)

Light sings
All over the world
(Brothers and sisters)
Light sings (come on now)
All over the world

(It's a new day)
Light sings
All over the world
(Let me tell you that)
Light sings (yes, it do now)
All over the world

(Here's the sun)
Light sings
(Yeah, come on and say it)
Light sings (come on)

Light sings
All over the world
(Mothers and fathers)
Light sings
All over the world

(Come on, come on)
Light sings
All over the world
(Come on, all over the world)
Light sings (oh, yeah)
All over the world
