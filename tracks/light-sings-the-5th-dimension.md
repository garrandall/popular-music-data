There is a garden
Something like the shadow of a butterfly
And lies beyond the gates of dark and light
And darling, it belongs to me

And when you go there
There will be such laughter in the dimpled sky
The songs I sing
Will drive away the night
The magic garden
Has a way of making you feel free

It's the place I've made for you
From five Players cards and dominoes
And it won't fall down

And when your dreaming vanishes
Like snowflakes in the summer sky
Melts away in darkness
And you don't know why the magic garden
Waits with all the gates wide open
And darlin', I'll be standin' just inside

It's so soft and warm
Behind those hedges
No hard edges
No hard edges

It's so soft and warm
Behind those hedges
No hard edges
No hard edges
