Look, uh, look

Heart been broke so many times I don't know what to believe (Yeah, yeah)
Mama say it's my fault, it's my fault, I wear my heart on my sleeve (Yeah, yeah)
Think it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice 'cause I can't breathe
I'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice, it's gettin' the best of me

While in the cell with Lil' Hakeem, after I slapped him I had told him
"I don't know how you get down with them clowns, but I'm a soldier"
No one could understand, I had way too much aggression (Brrt)
That built over the years from my abandoned adolescence
See I done been lied to, backstabbed, and heartbroken
I wanted to cry but I was too afraid to open
Prayin' one day I'd find a peace of mind by the ocean
I spent all my time committing crimes to get closer
While at my nana house I play the couch, starin' at the ceiling
Tryin' not to get in my feelings
Thinkin' of a way I can make these millions
Maybe that'll take this pain away and clear up all these rainy days, yeah

Heart been broke so many times I don't know what to believe (Know what to believe, yeah)
Mama say it's my fault, it's my fault, I wear my heart on my sleeve (My fault, it's my fault)
Think it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice 'cause I can't breathe (I can't breathe, I can't breathe)
I'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice, it's gettin' the best of me (The best of me)

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Brrt
