Every time I see you
It's just because you're blue
You don't really need me the way that I need you

Don't come on so groovy
You do better mean
You're like an old time movie
One that I've already seen

Baby, yes, I need your love, but I'm not gonna get this low
Don't you think
That I can tell
When you've no place else to go

Could it be you misunderstood
When you tried to read my mind
Cause this time
You will find
I'm gonna let you go
Every time I see you

You're like an old time movie

Baby, yes
I need your love
But I'm not gonna get this low
Don't you think
That I can tell
When you've got no place else to go

Could it be you misunderstood
When you tried to read my mind
Cause this time
You will find
I'm gonna let you go
Every time I see you
