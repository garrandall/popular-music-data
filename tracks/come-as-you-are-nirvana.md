Come as you are, as you were
As I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend
As an old enemy
Take your time, hurry up
Choice is yours, don't be late
Take a rest as a friend
As an old memoria


Memoria
Memoria
Memoria


Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach
As I want you to be
As a trend, as a friend
As an old memoria


Memoria
Memoria
Memoria


And I swear that I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun

Memoria
Memoria
Memoria (No, I don't have a gun)


And I swear that I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun


Memoria
Memoria
