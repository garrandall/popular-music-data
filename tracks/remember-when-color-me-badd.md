Nothing could be harder to believe
When you told me that you needed to be free, free
I'm only gettin' by on memories
Hopin' maybe time will help you see, see

*Chorus*
Remember when
I could see forever in your eyes (Forever)
Remember when
Together we could leave the world behind (Oh)
Oh, I've got nothin' to lose, nothin' to hide
Can't live without you, I'm dyin' inside
Can't we get it back again
Remember when

I'm searchin' for the one abandoned dream (I need to reclaim)
Heaven's in the love I cannot reach
(Can't reach) can't reach (Can't reach)
You know I'm longin' for the magic of your touch
And I thank God, I'm never givin' up the chance to trust you'll come
Back to me

*Chorus*
Remember when
I could see forever in your eyes (Forever)
Remember when
Together we could leave the world behind (Oh)
Oh, I've got nothin' to lose, nothin' to hide
Can't live without you, I'm dyin' inside
Can't we get it back again
Remember when, yeah

I know I'll be holdin' on to thoughts of yesterday
I keep holdin' on to the times we shared, baby
You know I'll never let you go, let you go

I could see forever (Hey) in your eyes
(I could see forever)
Remember when
Together we could leave the world behind
(Leave the world, leave the world behind)

I've got nothin' to lose, nothin' to hide
Can't live without you, I'm dyin' inside
Can't we get it back again
Remember when
