Every breathe you take
Every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take
I'll be watching you

Every single day
And every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay
I'll be watching you

Can't you see, you belong to me
How my poor heart aches, with every step you take
Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake

I'll be watching you
Since you gone
I've been lost without a trace
Dream at night I can only see your face
Look around but it's you, I can't replace
Feel so cold and I long for your embrace
I keep crying, baby, baby

Please...
Baby, baby
Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching...
You...
You...
Mmm
