Sally called when she got the word
And she said: "I suppose you've heard
About Alice"
When I rushed to the window
And I looked outside
And I could hardly believe my eyes
As a big limousine rolled up
Into Alice's drive...

Oh, I don't know why she's leaving
Or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons
But I just don't want to know
'Cos for twenty-four years
I've been living next door to Alice
Twenty-four years just waiting for a chance
To tell her how I feel, and maybe get a second glance
Now I've got to get used to not living next door to Alice...

We grew up together
Two kids in the park
We carved our initials
Deep in the bark
Me and Alice
Now she walks through the door
With her head held high
Just for a moment, I caught her eye
As a big limousine pulled slowly
Out of Alice's drive

Oh, I don't know why she's leaving
Or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons
But I just don't want to know
'Cos for twenty-four years
I've been living next door to Alice
Twenty-four years just waiting for a chance
To tell her how I feel, and maybe get a second glance
Now I gotta get used to not living next door to Alice...

And Sally called back and asked how I felt
And she said: "I know how to help
Get over Alice"
She said: "Now Alice is gone
But I'm still here
You know I've been waiting
For twenty-four years..."
And a big limousine disappeared...

I don't know why she's leaving
Or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons
But I just don't want to know
'Cos for twenty-four years
I've been living next door to Alice
Twenty-four years just waiting for a chance
To tell her how I feel, and maybe get a second glance
But I'll never get used to not living next door to Alice...

No, I'll never get used to not living next door to Alice...
