I always knew
Someday I'd find
Someone like you
Just to call mine

So I could love you
Yes, love you
With all of my heart

I've searched, my dear
So far and wide
Now you are here
Right by my side

So I could love you
Yes, I'll love you
With all of my heart

As clouds drift over mountains
And rivers flow to sea
My love flows like a fountain
Deep, deep and silently

One little kiss
A sweet carress
With all of this
How I've been blessed

I'll love you, yes, love you
With all of my heart

I'll love you
With all of my heart
