Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, I was rounding 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
I was rounding 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle

I was riding 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud, you can't imagine this shit
I been pulling up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused on my check (mhm)
Got a new coupe wraped around my neck (mhm)
Tryan put the water on my Patek (mhm)
I got killers to the left of me (mhm)


We was lurking on 'em, ain't show no mercy on 'em
We was going back to back, we put a curfew on 'em
It was dark clouds on us, but that was perfect for us
Know you always crash and burn, but it wa working for us
Limo tint the V-12, double check the details
Gotta cross my T's and dot my I's or I can't sleep well
Millions off of retail
Once again, I prevail
Knew that shit was over from the day I droped by presale
Hold up, let the beat build
See me in the streets still
I been fighting battles up a steep hill
They gave my road dog twelve, it was a sweet deal
And I been riding solo tryna rebuild


I was riding 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud, you can't imagine this shit
I been pulling up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused on my check (mhm)
Got a new coupe wraped around my neck (mhm)
Tryan put the water on my Patek (mhm)
I got killers to the left of me (mhm)


Look, under no condition would you ever catch me slipping
Motorcaded shooters plus the Maybach shofer driven
If they catch me with it, gone send me off to prison
Judge and sypathising, court don't show forgiveness
Isn't in the Lambo drowning out the music
Sip Dior with the flowers, five gold cubans
Champaigne while I shop, hope I splurge foolish
I was in Escrow twice this month, both commercial units
Damn, I wish my nigga Fatts was here
How you die thirty something after banging all them years
GRAMMY nominated, in the sign of shedding tears
All this money pile fame and I can't make you reappear
But I don't wipe 'em though
We just ebrace the only life we know
If it was me, I would tell you "nigga, live your life and grow"
I'd tell you "finish what we started, reach them heights, you know?
And gas the V-12 until the pipe is smoke"


I was riding 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud, you can't imagine this shit
I been pulling up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused on my check (mhm)
Got a new coupe wraped around my neck (mhm)
Tryan put the water on my Patek (mhm)
I got killers to the left of me (mhm)


Another million dollar bail, that's just some regular shit
See my granny on a jet, some shit I'll never forget
Next day we flew to Vegas, with my Puma connects
We break bread, we ain't new to success
Bleed music, invest, enterprise, take lucrative steps
Cold game, but I knew it was Chess
As a youth in the set
Learn the game, you a student at best
But it's a couple things you can expect
Look, just like money know money, nigga, shooters respect
Other shooters we was both, don't want my crew on your neck
I'm on the freeway in a drop, it got me losing my breath
I do the dash with the blues on the deck
