Everythin' to know about me
Is written on this page
A number you can reach me
My social and my age

Yes, I served in the army
It's where I learned to shoot
Eighteen months in the desert
Pourin' sand out of my boots

No, I've never been convicted of a crime
I could start this job at any time

I got a strong back, steel toes
Rarely call in sick, a good truck
What I don't know I catch on real quick
I work weekends, if I have to, nights and holidays

Give you forty and then some
Whatever it takes
Three dollars and change at the pump
Cost of livin's high and goin' up

I put Robert down as a reference
He's known me all my life
We attend the same church
He introduced me to my wife

Gave my last job everythin'
Before it headed south
Took the shoes off of my children's feet
The food out of their mouths

Yesterday my folks offered to help
But they're barely gettin' by themselves

I got a strong back, steel toes
I rarely call in sick, a good truck
What I don't know I catch on real quick
I work weekends, if I have to, nights and holidays

Give you forty and then some
Whatever it takes
Three dollars and change at the pump
Cost of livin's high and goin' up

I'm sure a hundred others have applied
Rumor has it you're only takin' five

I got a strong back, steel toes
I'm handy with a wrench
There's nothin' I can't drive
Nothin' I can't fix

I work sunup to sundown
Ain't too proud to sweep the floors
Bank has started callin'
And the wolves are at my door

Three dollars and change at the pump
Cost of livin's high and goin' up
