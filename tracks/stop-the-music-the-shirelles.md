Stop the music, stop the music, stop the music
Stop the music, stop the music, stop the music

Who does she think she is
Coming to my party
Then trying to dance
Every dance with my guy?

While the lights are dim
She's making time with him
And I don't like the look
That I see in her eyes
I'm gonna go over there and

(Stop the music, stop the music, stop the music)
When this record ends
(Stop the music, stop the music, stop the music)
I'm gonna stop the music
If they dance again

Its kinda quiet now (Shhhh)
The last song has ended
And another song is starting
Starting to play.

She's walking across the floor (huh!)
Straight into his arms once more
I'm gonna put a stop
To this thing right away
I'm gonna go over there and

(Stop the music, stop the music, stop the music)
I can't take it no more
(Stop the music, stop the music, stop the music)
So turn on the lights
The party's over for tonight

You hear what I say, now?

(Stop the music, stop the music, stop the music)
(Stop the music, stop the music, stop the music)
So turn on the lights, the party's over...
