Yeah
Rest in peace to all the kids that lost their lives in the Parkland shooting, this song is dedicated to you


Okay, she keep callin, she keep callin' every single night
Day and night, on my mind, please don't kill the vibe
All alone, swear to God, I be in my mind
Swear I wanna die, yeah, when you cross my—
Said I wanna die, yuh, no, I'm not alright, yuh
I might start a riot, yuh, I'm so fuckin' tired, yuh
So what's up? What you say? Feelin' good, I'm feelin' great
Tired of the fuckin' hate, stackin' cheese all on my plate


So outside my misery, I think I'll find
A way of envisioning a better life
For the rest of us, the rest of us
There's hope for the rest of us, the rest of us


Okay, she keep callin', she keep callin' every single night
Day and night, on my mind, please don't kill the vibe
Oh no, I swear to God, I be in my mind
Swear I wanna die, yeah, when you cross my—
Said I wanna die, yuh, no, I'm not alright, yuh
I might start a riot, yuh, I'm so fuckin' tired, yuh
So what's up? What you say? Feelin' good, I'm feelin' great
Tired of the fuckin' hate, stackin' cheese all on my plate
