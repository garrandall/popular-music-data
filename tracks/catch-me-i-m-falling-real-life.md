I lay down to rest my head
My soul to keep the night ahead
It's no dream
Slumber comes as darkness falls
And Shadows dance across my walls
It's no dream

Well I never sleep alone
(Wake up don't sleep)
My dreams become so real to me
(Wake up don't sleep)
I unplug the phone
While the night is young

Catch me I'm falling
Down again
I know it's a dream but
Just the same

There's a face before my eyes
Are closed but I can recognise
The danger there
Slumber comes and darkness falls
And shadows dance across my walls
It's no dream

Well I never sleep alone
(Wake up don't sleep)
My dreams become so real to me
(Wake up don't sleep)
I unplug the phone
While the night is young

Catch me I'm falling
Down again
I know it's a dream but
Just the same
Catch me I'm falling
Falling

Catch me I'm falling
Down again
I know it's a dream but
Just the same
Catch me I'm falling
Down again
I know it's a dream but
Just the same

I'm falling
I'm falling

Catch me I'm falling

I'm falling

Catch me I'm falling
I'm falling

Catch me I'm falling
I'm falling
