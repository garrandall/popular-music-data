Such a silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I
Oh, I, just a silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I 

Hey, I should have never fallen
Back in love with you
Knowin' how you get a pleasure
Breaking my poor heart in two 
You made it sound so convincin'
When you said 
"I'm your woman, you're my man"
Now I really need you
And I sit here a loser again

I guess I'm just a silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I, oh I
I'm such a silly, silly, silly, silly, fool am I, mmm

I should have never trusted 
In my heart to lead the way
Now my mind is all busted
That's a fool's price to pay

You made it sound so convincin'
When you said you'd never, never go away
I should have never listened
To anything you had to say

I'm such a silly, silly, silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I, yes I am
I'm such a silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I, oh
Such a silly, silly, dilly, silly, dilly fool am I, oh yeah
I'm such a silly, silly, silly, silly, silly fool am I, oh yes I am
I'm such a silly, silly, dilly, silly, dilly, silly fool am I, oh yeah
I'm such a silly, dilly, silly, dilly, silly fool am I, oh
Silly, dilly
