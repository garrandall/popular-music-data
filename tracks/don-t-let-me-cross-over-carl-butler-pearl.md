Don't let me cross over
Love's cheating line

I'm tempted, my darling
To steal you away
Don't let me cross over
Stay out of my way

You know that I love you
And I'm not the stealing kind
But I'm faced with heartaches
At love's cheating line

Don't let me cross over
Love's cheating line
You belong to another
And could never be mine

I know one step closer
Would be Heaven divine
Don't let me cross over
Love's cheating line

I tried to forget you
But what else can I do
When your eyes keep saying
That you love me too

I know if I lose you
Not a dream will I have left
I don't want to cheat, dear
But I can't help myself

Don't let me cross over
Love's cheating line
You belong to another
And could never be mine

I know one step closer
Would be Heaven divine
Don't let me cross over
Love's cheating line
