Some people like to rock, some people like to roll
A-movin' and a-groovin' gonna satisfy the soul, let's have a party
(Oh)
Let's have a party
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's add 'em to the store, let's buy some more
Let's have a party tonight

Well, I never kissed a ?, I never kissed a ?
But I can shake it, shake it in the middle of the room
Let's have a party
(Oh)
Let's have a party
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Let's add 'em to the store, let's buy some more
Let's have a party tonight
