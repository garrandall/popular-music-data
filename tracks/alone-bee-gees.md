I was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke
I could make a woman hang on every single stroke
I was an iron man, I had a master plan
But I was alone


I could hear you breathing with a sigh of the wind
I remember how your body started trembling
Oh, what a night it's been and for the state I'm in
I'm still alone


And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Somehow I always end up alone (always end up alone)
Always end up alone


So I play, I'll wait
Cause you know that love takes time
We came so far
Just the beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't want to be alone


Well, since I got no message on your answer phone
Since you're busy every minute I just stay at home
I make believe you care, I feel you everywhere
But I'm still alone


I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate
Cause I know it isn't heaven, is it love or hate?
Am I the subject of the pain? Am I the stranger in the rain?
I am alone

And if there glory there to behold
Maybe it's my imagination
Another story there to be told


So I play, I'll wait
And I pray it's not too late
We made it so far
Just a beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't want to be alone


And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Another story there to be told


So I play, I'll wait
And I pray it's not too late
We made it so far
Just a beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't want to be alone


Gone but not out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
Face the heat of the night
The one that you love got a heart that's made of stone

Shine and search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean
And clean out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home

Face the heat of the night
The one that you love got a heart that's made of stone

Shine and search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean

And clean out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
