Wonderful Summer

-Artist: Robin Ward
-peak Billboard position # 14 in 1963-64
-Words and Music by Gil Garfield and Perry Botkin, Jr

I want to thank you for giving me
The most wonderful summer of my life
It was so heavenly
You meant the world to me
And anyone could see that I was so in love

I want to thank you for giving me
The most wonderful summer of my life
I never will forget
That summer day we met
You were so shy and yet you stole my heart away

We strolled along the sand
Walking hand in hand
Then you kissed me and I knew
That I would love you my whole life through

I want to thank you for giving me
The most wonderful summer of my life
And though it broke my heart
That day we had to part
I'll always thank you for giving me
The most wonderful summer of my life
