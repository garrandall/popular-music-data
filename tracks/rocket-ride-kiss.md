Lady space, you like the way
I make you feel inside
Take a rocket ride
From the start, you wanted to fly
I got the rocket, and you want the ride
Take a rocket ride


Baby wants it fast, baby wants a blast
She wants a rocket ride, she wants a rocket ride
Baby wants it fast, baby wants a blast
She wants a rocket ride, she wants a rocket ride


Lady space, you better wake up fast
Countdown is coming on
Take a rocket ride
The gravity that used to hold you down
Just don't exist no more
Take a rocket ride


Baby wants it fast, baby wants a blast
She wants a rocket ride, she wants a rocket ride
Baby wants it fast, baby wants a blast
She wants a rocket ride, she wants a rocket ride

Come on, grab a hold of my rocket!


Baby wants it fast, baby wants a blast
She wants a rocket ride, she wants a rocket ride
Baby wants it fast, baby wants a blast
She wants a rocket ride, she wants a rocket ride


Baby's on her knees, baby wants to please
She wants a rocket ride, she wants a rocket ride
Baby's on her knees, baby wants to please
She wants a rocket ride, she wants a rocket ride
