Haha
Talking 'bout me leaving America
You got ta be crazy
Man, I like all the nice things, Jack
Continental suits and things
Looka here

Now, I'm sorry for the man
Who don't love this land
Now black and white, they may fight, ha
But if the enemy come
We'll get together and run 'em out of sight

Now looka here
The sun don't come out in rainy weather
But when you boil it down, they are still together
Now let's not overlook the fact that we are, we are still in reach
You got s chance to make it and you got a freedom of speech
Say what you wanna, tell 'em how you feel
There may be a lot of places, a lot of places that you like to go
But believe me, if you get an education you can blow
You can hardly blow

Now dig this
Now you tell me if I'm wrong
America is still the best country
And that's without a doubt
America is still the best country without a doubt
And if anybody says it ain't, you just try to put him out
They ain't going nowhere, you got a good fight

When I tell you one time that I was a shoeshine boy
Every word I said, I meant
But name me any other country
You can start as a shoeshine boy
And shake hands with the president
It ain't gonna help, you got to have that royal blood to make it
And I ain't got nothing royal but me, soul
I can't take the chances, I'm gonna stay home

Now looka here
I got a brand new jet
When I need to move, ha
A soul brother made it
Now it ain't that a groove

So looka here
Brothers and sisters and friends, dig this
So quit your dreaming all night
Stop beatin' yourself and get up and fight
Don't give up, you might give up, but just don't give out
I know if you give out don't give up
Just don't quit going, I mean like keep it moving, you know
'Cause if you stop like a ball quit rolling

Now, we got tours that carry us from Florida to Rome
But you know there's one thing we'll never forget
America's still our home
Hit it, band
God bless America
I'm talking about me, too, you know I'm American myself
I like that kind of thing
Looka here
