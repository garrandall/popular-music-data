She falls somewhere in between
Levi's and Vogue Magazine
She doesn't paint on her face
But what she does she does with taste

And you can call her Plain Jane
But she's drivin' me insane
(Plain Jane) Oh yeah, you're drivin' me insane
(Plain Jane) Well, let me love you baby, yeah

She kisses with her lips so tight
Ooh, it hits me just like dynamite
Her sweet, simple innocence
Makes everyone else seem like past tense

And you can call her Plain Jane
But she's drivin' me insane
(Plain Jane) Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're drivin' me insane, oh
(Plain Jane) Please, oh
Well, let me love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you

Takes a special kind of man
To love and understand
My Plain Jane
My Plain Jane, talkin' 'bout my baby
My Plain Jane, oh yeah 

(Plain Jane) Ow, uh-huh, my 
(Plain Jane) Ain't no body else no
(Plain Jane) Tellin' you you're drivin me insane

Her smile comes on insecure
But her eyes, they let you know for sure
Oh, you gotta look hard and deep
Her kind of lovin', it don't come cheap, no

And you can call her Plain Jane
But she's drivin' me insane
My (Plain Jane) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're drivin' me insane. Ow
(Plain Jane) I just, want so bad
I wanna love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you

(Plain Jane) Ow! I'm talkin' 'bout my
(Plain Jane) Yeah, yeah, she's my baby
(Plain Jane) See her walkin' down the street, and I just wanna love you
My (Plain Jane) come here baby
(Plain Jane) Now, come here baby
(Plain Jane) There ain't nobody else, no
I'm gonna love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you

(Plain Jane) Ow
(Plain Jane) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Plain Jane)
