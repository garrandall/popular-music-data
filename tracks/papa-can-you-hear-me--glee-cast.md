God - our heavenly Father.
Oh, God - and my father
Who is also in heaven.
May the light
Of this flickering candle
Illuminate the night the way
Your spirit illuminates my soul.

Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you see me?
Papa, can you hear me in the night?

Papa, are you near me?
Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you help me not be frightened?

Looking at the skies
I seem to see a million eyes
Which ones are yours?
Where are you now that yesterday
Has come and gone?
And closed its doors?
The night is so much darker.
The wind is so much colder

The world I see is so much bigger now that I'm alone.

Papa, please forgive me.
Try to understand me.
Papa, don't you know I had no choice?

Can you hear me praying,
Anything I'm saying,
Even though the night is filled with voices?

I remember ev'rything you taught me
Every book I've ever read.
Can all the words in all the books
Help me to face what lies ahead?
The trees are so much taller
And I feel so much smaller.
The moon is twice as lonely
And the stars are half as bright.

Papa, how I love you.
Papa, how I need you.
Papa, how I miss you
Kissing me goodnight.
