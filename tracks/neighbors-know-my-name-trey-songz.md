Soon as we get started making love going hard
I hear a knock, knock, knocking on the wall
And as soon as I go deep getting it in, then again
There's a knock, knock, knocking on the wall
Girl, your legs keep shaking and I swear
We breaking our new headboard headboard
And the love we make, it feels so good, girl, you know I'm proud
Looking in your lovely face scream my name, you do it so loud

I bet the neighbors know my name
Way you screaming, scratching, yelling
Bet the neighbors know my name
And they be stressing while we sexing
Bet the neighbors know my name
My name, my name
I bet the neighbors know my name
My my my

Take this pillow right here, grab this
And I know you're so excited, if you bite it they won't hear
And you know just what we capable of, when we making love
So the music gone be loud, you gone scream and shout
Girl, your body's a problem, they call me the problem solver
Let phone sit on the charger, it could ring all night
They can call, they can knock and be upset, but I bet

I bet the neighbors know my name
Way you screaming, scratching, yelling
Bet the neighbors know my name
And they be stressing while we sexing
Bet the neighbors know my name
My name, my name
I bet the neighbors know my name
My my my

While I'll be banging on your body, they be banging on our wall
While they dreaming, you be screaming now they banging on our door
Sometimes she call me Trey, sometimes she say Tremaine
When its all said and done, bet the neighbors know my name
Sometimes she call me Trigga 'cause I make her body bust
He might think my name is "Oh shit", I make her cuss

I bet the neighbors know my name
Way you screaming, scratching, yelling
Bet the neighbors know my name
And they be stressing while we sexing
Bet the neighbors know my name
My name, my name
I bet the neighbors know my name
I bet the neighbors know my name
I bet the neighbors know my name
Way you screaming, scratching, yelling
Bet the neighbors know my name
And they be stressing while we sexing
Bet the neighbors know my name
My name, my name
I bet the neighbors know my name
My my my

The way you scream my name, whoa
Girl, the love we make
Gone keep on banging on the wall, but nothing's gonna change
I bet the neighbors know my name
