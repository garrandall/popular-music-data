You make many promises, and they sound so sweet
Talk like yours will knock most any girl right off her feet
When will you deliver, words can't warm my night
Conversation's nice, but I need a man to hold me tight

Some days you just don't have to say it, say it, say it, say it, say it
'Cause sometimes words get in the way
So don't give me your lines

I want action
Oh, so tough
Action
If you really want my love

Like the way you think, the way you speak your mind
You want to get together, well, that suits me just fine
You call me up to tell me the things you'd like to do
You and I got time for love, but never follow through

You set me up, oh, so tough, so tough, so tough, so tough
Now I'm cravin' your love
It's time to show your head

I want to see action
Show me the real deal face to face, oh
Action
Got to know if you can keep up the pace

Don't say one thing and do another
Don't put yourself in the middle of a mine field and then run for cover

Action
It's your move
Action
Put it into action, let's see what you can do

Action
Action
Action, action, action, action, action, action, action, action

'Cause everybody needs love

And I want action
I'm all talked out
Action
Tell me what you're all about

They say that action speaks louder than words
Now tell me, are you gonna go for what you know
Or stand there lookin' absurd

Action
It's up to you, got to put it into
Action
Got to follow through, uh, huh, uh

Can't control temptation, much to my surprise
You're drivin' me crazy, I can't help but speak my mind
I'm so fascinated, you're makin' me come alive
So come on now, baby, I wanna be with you tonight

Action

It's up to you
You know what I wanna do
I'm all talked out
Tell me what you're all about

Ah...

Action
It's up to you
Action
You know what I wanna do

Action
I'm all talked out
Action
Tell me what you're all about

Action, action, action, action, action, action, action, act
