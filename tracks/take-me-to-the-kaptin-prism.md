The planet dies... no one cries
So hard to believe
If there was somewhere else to go
You know I'd be the first to leave

I don't mean to sound ungrateful
But I'm afraid that I just can't stay

I had a dream the other night
And as the dream unfurled
I took a trip in a rocket ship
And I found another world

They told me about their Kaptin
They'd have to ask him could I stay - I said

Take me to the Kaptin
And tell him why I'm here
I want to stay in your world
While my world disappears

Won't you take me to the Kaptin
And tell him why I'm here
I want to stay in your world
While my world disappears

(Solo)

I had a dream the other night
And as the dream unfurled
I took a trip in a rocket ship
And I found another world
They told me about their Kaptin
They'd have to ask him could I stay - I said

Take me to the Kaptin
And tell him why I'm here
I want to stay in your world
While my world disappears

Won't you take me to the Kaptin
And tell him why I'm here
I want to stay in your world
While my world disappears
