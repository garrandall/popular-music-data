Back when all my little goals seemed so important
Every pot of gold feeling full of distortion
Heaven was a place still in space not in motion
But soon


I got you
I got everything, I’ve got you
I don’t need nothing more than you
I got everything, I’ve got you


We went walking through the hills trying to pretend that we both know
Maybe if we save them we could build a little home
But then the hailstorm came, it yelled
“You need to let go, you got no control"
No


I got you
I got everything, I’ve got you
I don’t need nothing more than you
I got everything, I’ve got you


This weight’s too much alone
Some days I can’t hold it at all
You take it on for me
When tomorrow’s too much I’ll carry it all
I got you
Yea when tomorrow’s too much I’ll carry it all
I got you


I got you
I got everything, I’ve got you
I don’t need nothing more than you
I got everything, I’ve got you
