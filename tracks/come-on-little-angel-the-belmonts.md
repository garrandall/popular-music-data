Come on little angel won't you dance with me
Well at last I know you know it was plain to see
We did the Mashed Potato and it sure was fun
Now ev'rybody wants to see the way it was done, now
Come on little angel hear the band playing loud
Turn around see them forming a crowd
And now, little angel, now that you're in the groove
You hear them all a-clapping as we both start to move
Now, come on, come on little angel, come on
Come on little angel, come on
Come on little angel, come on, come on

Come on little angel now the lights are down low
It's really getting late and we have to go
Well thank you little angel for that wonderful kiss
And now you're gonna tell me that you're doing the Twist
Around and around and up and down
Around and around and up and down
Around and around and up and down
Around and around and up and down
Yes, little angel, it sure is fun
Every time we're dancin' she's a-right on time
She moves to the left, she moves to the right
She feels the beat and she dances all the night

Why don't you come on little angel now the lights are down low
It's really getting late and now we have to go
Well thank you little angel for that wonderful kiss
And now you're gonna tell me that you're doing the Twist

Around and around and up and down
