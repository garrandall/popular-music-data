Night and you and Blue Hawaii
The night is heavenly and you are heaven to me
Lovely you and Blue Hawaii
Night and you and Blue Hawaii
The night is heavenly and you are heaven to me
Lovely you and Blue Hawaii
With all this loveliness there should be love

Come with me while the moon is on the sea
The night is young and so are we, so are we
Dreams come true in Blue Hawaii
And mine could all come true this magic night of nights with you

Come with me while the moon is on the sea (the moon is on the sea)
The night is young and so are we (so are we)
Dreams come true in Blue Hawaii
And mine could all come true this magic night of nights with you
