Love me or leave me, make your choice but believe me
I love you, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I can't conceal it, don't you see, can't you feel it?
Don't you too? I do, I do, I do, I do, I do


Oh, I've been dreaming through my lonely past
Now I just made it, I found you at last


So come on, now let's try it, I love you, can't deny it
'Cause it's true, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do




Oh, no hard feelings between you and me
If we can't make it, but just wait and see


So come on, now let's try it, I love you, can't deny it
'Cause it's true, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
So love me or leave me, make your choice but believe me
I love you, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I can't conceal it, don't you see, can't you feel it?
Don't you too? I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
