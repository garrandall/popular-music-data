I'll always remember,
the song they were playing,
The first time we danced and I knew

As we swayed to the music,
and held to each other,
I fell in love with you


Could I have this dance
for the rest of my life,
Could you be my partner
every night,
when we're together
it feels so right,
Could I have this dance
for the rest of my life

I'll always remember,
that magic moment,
When I held you close to me

As we move together,
I knew forever,
you're all I'll ever need

Could I have this dance
for the rest of my life,
Could you be my partner
every night,
when we're together
it feels so right,
Could I have this dance
for the rest of my life

Could I have this dance
for the rest of my life,
Could you be my partner
every night,
when we're together
it feels so right,
Could I have this dance
for the rest of my life!
