You see I been waiting
Waiting on that time
Feel me if you been waiting on yours
That momentâ¦Is close


Tired of living day to day like everything is alright
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment


Old dude met mom it was on
Then he named me over a phone, prison term
Live and learn, sippinâ syrup with my vision blurred
Take this cup of reality, niggas finna err
When you start from the bottom you can see the top
So when you get to it, donât let âem see the spot
Next thing you know you lookinâ for a rent sign
Upper echelon, bitch we skip line
I remember reminiscing in the kitchen like
I wonder when the Braves gonâ win it
I wonder when the Falcons gonâ get here
Pyrex vison, made more than I ever made with DTP this year


Tired of livinâ day to day like everything is alright
Every night just one thing on my mind
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment
You say how you got that shit, hell
Next time thats mine
Long as I stay hustlin I'm gonâ shine
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment


Just waiting on my moment
Bad hoes Iâm showin
Time came and I owned it
Just like Lebron James and start ballin
When I touch the rock I cracked the block
When I pulled up in that muscle drop
With that roof off and my shoes off
On you bitch niggas, RuPaul
Real nigga in my hood, who errbody gonâ root for
They see my come from that bottom
Where errbody get bodied
They told me get em, I got em
Now I'm here nigga like yeah nigga
Just Rolls Royce and Bugattis
And m4 this year nigga
If I don't grind, I don't shine
If I don't shine, then I donâ eat
Wonât eat, then Ima starve
If Ima starve, I pull heat
On all yall bitch ass niggas
All yall rich azz niggas
Cuz if I donâ make no money nigga
Iâm gonâ take yo money nigga




Since life ainât promised tomorrow
Live it up live it up live it up
Here before it come this far
Give it up give it up give it up
âI wonâtâ give it up give it up give up
Until I have it all, YEAH
