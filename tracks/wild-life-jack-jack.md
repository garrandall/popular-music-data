Yeah, no telling what I might do
When I'm in the right mood
You know me
I'm all up in the party like a V.I.P
And everything is looking better from my P.O.V
Nocturnal animals, we don't sleep
And I'll probably forget you, CeeLo Green (CeeLo)
I'm sweatin like the Amazon, a hundred degrees
And that back side's bigger than a family tree
So drop that thing like a fumble
Like ya talking to the king of the jungle
We got lions, tigers, bears oh my
And every single ones turnt up, yo
I don't want anybody bringing the vibes down
So if you want to wind down, oh look what I found
A little something that'll keep you awake
Until the break of dawn
Don't be afraid to get rowdy


We're not done yet
Pass me the bottle
It's 2 a.m., let's hit the throttle
Drink in my cup
Hands going up
Let's hit the dance floor and get


Wild like

Yeah, everybody going crazy on the dance floor
Jam packed, got a couple bands back
From the back on my last trip like a ransacked
Everybody hanging like a string from a Tampax
Yes, my bitches back from the Amtrak
You ain't never heard of flow quite like this
Everywhere I turn seeing iced out wrists
She might be German, she might be Swiss, (god damn)
And I'm feeling pretty hectic, lights all around
Good thing I'm not epileptic
I'm kinda confused like I'm measuring in metric
Talking shit, you better take it back interception
Like the forests are blazing
Get the wild life jumping like an animal rave
I know your parents say they miss the good old days
But things change


We're not done yet
Pass me the bottle
It's 2 a.m., let's hit the throttle
Drink in my cup
Hands going up
Let's hit the dance floor and get

Hey you come here girl, party with me (party with me)
You know its going to be a wild night (so wild)
Move that body to the melody (melody)
I could show you how to live the wild life (wild life)
Ain't gotta spend a dime (its free)
You know it's going to be a wild night (let's go)
Doors open, you don't need a key (no key)
Show you how to live the wild life (wild life)


We're not done yet
Pass me the bottle
It's 2 a.m., let's hit the throttle
Drink in my cup
Hands going up
Let's hit the dance floor and get
