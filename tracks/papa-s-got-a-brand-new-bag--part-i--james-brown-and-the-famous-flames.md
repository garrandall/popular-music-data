Come Here Sister... Papa's In The Swing
He Ain't Too Hip... About That New Breed Thing
He Ain't No Drag
Papa's Got A Brand New Bag
Come Here Mama... And Dig This Crazy Scene
He's Not Too Fancy... But His Mind Is Might Clean
He Ain't No Drag.
Papa's Got A Brand New Bag
He's Doing The Jerk...
He's Doing The Fly
Don't Play Him Cheap 'Cause You Know He Ain't Shy
He's Doing The Monkey,
The Mashed Potatoes, Jump Back Jack, See You Later
Alligator.
Come Here Sister
Papa's In The Swing
He Ain't Too Hip Now
But I Can Dig That New Breed Babe;
He Ain't No Drag
He's Got A Brand New Bag
Oh Papa! He's Doing The Jerk
Papa... He's Doing The Jerk
He's Doing The Twist ... Just Like This,
He's Doing The Fly Ev'ry Day And Ev'ry Night
The Thing's... Like The Boomerang.
Hey... Come On
Hey! Hey... Come On
Hey! Hey... He's Pu Tight... Out Of Sight...
Come On. Hey! Hey!
