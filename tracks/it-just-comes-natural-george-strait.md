Sun shines, clouds rain
Train whistles blow and guitars play
Preachers preach, farmers plow
Wishes go up and the world goes round

And I love you, it just comes natural
It just comes natural
Seasons change rivers wind
Tumble weeds roll and the stars shine
Wind howls, dawn breaks
Cowboys riding' time slips away

And I love you, it just comes natural
It's what I was born to do
Don't have to think it through
Baby, it's so easy loving you
It just comes natural

It's what I was born to do
Don't have to think it through
Baby it's so easy loving you

Fire burns waves crash
Seeds grow and good things last
Ships sail dreams fly
Night falls and full moons rise

And I love you, it just comes natural
And I love you, it just comes natural
It just comes natural
It just comes natural
