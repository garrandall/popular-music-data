Daytrip took it to ten
Hey


Don't need nobody
Did it on my 1's, don't owe nobody
You're a chief, you're a pussy, just anybody
Might have a strally, that don't make you gully
Like give me all the pennies, make pounds 'n I'm out
I want P, you can keep the clout
Way too gobby getting boxed in the mouth
Noddy still got a shotty with the spouse
All I want's a house, so I can set you free
And let the dogs hunt you down
Drinks on me, at the bottom with the clowns
Who's laughing now, you lost the plot
That's your peak, I wanna chain like McD's
Bust your head, fuck the feds, no reason (Fuck 'em)
Who needs one when you're vexed
Living on the edge, come correct you're moving wet
You're a sket, sell MD I call it peck (Pricey!)
Clock in, on the ball like Petr Cech
My team Jurgen Klopp's, you're a tool in the shed
Bro, you're just a flop, you're a dopp, 'nuff said
Put your face on a hob, when I see blood red (Ah)
Clock in, on the ball like Petr Cech
My team Jurgen Klopp's, you're a tool in the shed
Bro, you're just a flop, you're a dopp, 'nuff said
Put your face on a hob, when I see blood (red)

Lights out
I'm the guide, like a lighthouse
Look at me funny, might poke your eyes out
Play, don't funny, fluffy bunny in my ends (Lights out)
I'm the guide, like a lighthouse
Look at me funny, might poke your eyes out
Play, don't funny, fluffy bunny in my ends
I was bummy in my ends
Chuggin' bottles, 110s
I ain't trying to make friends
I was bummy in my ends
Chuggin' bottles, 110s
I ain't trying to make friends


Look, okay, nigga I ain't trying to make no homies
I just got the Glock 19, I just got it from my bro
Keep it on me in the summertime, my ho
City turnt, take mine with the miniburst
Like  say, miniturf
Nigga said he gon' kill me on the internet
He only talking cause KT ain't came to kill him yet
You better chill with all that side talk before you hit that sidewalk
Outlined in FBI chalk, you finna make me
You finna make me lose my cool (My cool)
Chop and shake this block up just like it's 1992
Hit a pussy nigga, turf and go crazy
He ain't see me 'cause I came disguised as an old lady
Non-affiliated, still I'm not the one to play with
Niggas killed the homie so we 'bout to take a daytrip
Bitch I'm on 10, the K9 is coming time to go hit that fence


Shoppin' that self ridges, I do not burn bridges
Went from racks to bridges, went from "Who dat?" to "Please let me take pictures"
All I wanna do is get rich and then get richer
Only person in my family making six figures
Lights out, neck still on
Flight landed, but I'm still gone
Fuck friends, I go buy cars
She wanna fuck with a real rockstar
I seen a stank, but these bitches not hard
You want some, I just make one call
I'll get you dealt with, show you the reason why I'm not the one to mess with
Yes, I be stacking up my money like it's Tetris
Everywhere I go I'm good, ain't gotta check it
I'm in London with the pals like I'm Hefner
Never know my next move, I keep 'em guessing


Lights out
I'm the guide, like a lighthouse
Look at me funny, I might poke your eyes out
Play, don't funny, fluffy bunny in my ends (Lights out)
I'm the guide, like a lighthouse
Look at me funny, might poke your eyes out
Play, don't funny, fluffy bunny in my ends
I was bummy in my ends
Chuggin' bottles, 110s
I ain't trying to make friends
I was bummy in my ends
Chuggin' bottles, 110s
I ain't trying to make friends

I was bummy in my ends
Chuggin' bottles, 110s
I ain't trying to make friends
I was bummy in my ends
Chuggin' bottles, 110s
I ain't trying to make friends
I ain't trying to pool
Daytrip took it to ten
I hate people
They're just so weird, man
I fucking hate them (Haha)
