You think that I'd like to make it with you, girl
But it's against my better judgement to do it
And you think that I know how good it would be
You think it means a lot to me but it doesn't

I don't wanna see your picture hangin' in my hall
You don't wanna be another star on the wall, no
I just wanna be your friend
I just wanna be your friend
I just wanna be your friend, that's all
Yeah, Baby know what I mean, Baby know what I mean
Baby know what I mean, Baby know what I mean

Ah, I know you think you've met my kind before, girl
But there is more to me than what you're seein'
And I don't want your face to look the same to me
As those who only want to play their games

I don't wanna see your picture hangin' in my hall
You don't wanna be another star on the wall, no
I just wanna be your friend, yes I do
I just wanna be your friend, all the time
I just wanna be your friend, that's all
Yeah, Baby know what I mean, Baby know what I mean
Baby know what I mean, Baby know what I mean

I don't wanna see your picture hangin' in my hall
You don't wanna be another star on the wall, no
I just wanna be your friend, yes I do
I just wanna be your friend, all the time
I just wanna be your friend, that's all
