Do I have to say it?
Don't you already know it?
Do I have to spell it out?
Don't you think I show it

Can't you see it's you I want tonight
(You have to read it)
You have to read it inbetween the lines


Do you compute?
What does it take to make you understand?
Do you compute?
I'm trying to tell you I'm in love with you

I ain't no good with words
No I'm no good at at talking
I'm misunderstood
Misunderstood too often

Now baby if you'll open up your eyes
(Then you will feel)
Then you will feel the way I feel inside



Now baby if you'll open up your eyes
(Then you will feel)
Then you will feel the way I feel inside
