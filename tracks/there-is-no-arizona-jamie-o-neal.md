He promised her a new and better life
Out in Arizona
Underneath the blue neverending sky
Swore that he was gonna
Get things in order
He'd send for her
When he left her behind
It never crossed her mind

There is no Arizona
No Painted Desert, no Sedona
If there was a Grand Canyon
She could fill it up with the lies he's told her
But they don't exist, those dreams he sold her
She'll wake up and find there is no Arizona

She got a postcard with no return address
Postmarked Tombstone
It said, "I don't know where I'm goin' next
But when I do I'll let you know"
May, June, July
She wonders why
She's still waiting
She'll keep waiting

'Cause there is no Arizona
No Painted Desert, no Sedona
If there was a Grand Canyon
She could fill it up with the lies he's told her
But they don't exist, those dreams he sold her
She'll wake up and find there is no Arizona

Each day the sun sets into the west
Her heart sinks lower in her chest
And friends keep asking when she's going
Finally she tells them, don't you know

There is no Arizona
No Painted Desert, no Sedona
If there was a Grand Canyon
She could fill it up with the lies he's told her
But they don't exist, those dreams he sold her
She'll wake up and find there is no Arizona

He promised her a new and better life
Out in Arizona
