Have you ever been driving down the road
And come up on a fella who was just poking along straddlin' the white line
And when you try to pass him he'd speed up
Ha ha well around here we call this falla a Road Hog
This is a story about him and his eventual end

Well me and my buddy went a ridin' last night
Me and my buddy went a ridin' last night
We topped a hill and we saw his lights
Road Hog beep beep do do do do Road Hog beep beep do do do do
When we saw him we almost died when we saw him we almost died
He was a comin' at us on our side
Road Hog beep beep do do do do Road Hog beep beep do do do do
My buddy said that fella sure come mighty near
Probably some learner who don't know how to steer
And then I saw his lights a comin' up in my mirror
Road Hog beep beep do do do do Road Hog beep beep do do do do
He passed us a goin' bout a hundred I guess
He passed us a goin' bout a hundred I guess
And then he slowed down to twenty or less
Road Hog beep beep do do do do Road Hog beep beep do do do do
I tooted my horn and I started to pass I blinked my lights and I started to pass
And then that Road Hog stepped on the gas
Road Hog beep beep do do do do Road Hog beep beep do do do do
You'd better get him up some money for bail
You'd better get him up some money for bail
Cause tomorrow morning he will be in jail
Road Hog beep beep do do do do Road Hog beep beep do do do do
The boys will have him in the morning behind bars
The boys will have him in the morning behind bars
Cause I'm the County Sheriff in my unmarked car ha ha ha
Road Hog beep beep do do do do Road Hog beep beep do do do do
