Early Monday morning to Friday at five,
Man, I work, work, work but I don't climb, climb, climb
Boss man can shove that overtime up his can,
All I wanna do is put a drink in my hand

Fill it up or throw it down,
I got a forty-hour week worth of trouble to drown
No need to complicate it. I'm a simple man,
All you gotta do is put a drink in my hand

Yeah, the parking lot is muddy. Can't get to the door,
I take my jacked-up drop er down in 4x4
Chill down a long neck, warm up the band,
All you gotta do is put a drink in my hand

Fill it up or throw it down,
I'm about to tear a new one in this old town
5-4-3-2-1. I'm a rocket man,
All you gotta do is put a drink in my hand

Make me wanna go, oh oohohohhen you dance like that,
You got that little tattoo playing peeky boo on your back
Yeah, if you want to impress me, baby, here's my plan,
All you gotta do is put a drink in my hand

Fill it up or throw it down,
When you drive me home take the long way around
You be my Lois Lane I'll be your Superman,
All you gotta do is put a drink in my hand

My head Monday morning, that alarm clock sings,
It goes bang, bang, bang while it ring-ring-rings
Yeah, I'm ready to roll if you wanna rock again,
All you gotta do is put a drink in my hand

Fill it up or throw it down,
I got a little hungover still hanging around
Yeah, that hair of a dog is howling, "Hey there, man!"
All you gotta do is put a drink in my hand

Yeah, that hair of a dog is howling, "Hey there, man!"
All you gotta do is put a drink in my hand

Haaaouuhhh, yeah
