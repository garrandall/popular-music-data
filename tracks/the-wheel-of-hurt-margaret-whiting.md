You're gonna know what it means to be lonely,
You're gonna know what it means to be blue.
You're gonna know how it feels
To feel your heart breaking in two,
When the wheel of hurt come wheelin round to you.
I'll see you cryin bitter tears one day baby
I'll hear you sayin you're so sorry we are through.
But I'll be the first one to help you
Because you'll need someone that's true.
When the wheel of hurt come wheelin round to you.
You're gonna learn the truth the hard way,
But once you learn you'll always know;
That it's bad luck to hurt somebody
When the somebody loves you so.
It may be today or it may be tomorrow
You'll have to pay when your payment is due
And maybe then you'll realize
Just how much pain you put me through
When the wheel of hurt come wheelin round to you
