Sugar 

Sweet, succulent and fine 
A twinkling eye on my darling divine 
I love the way you move all the way you're designed 
Your only lines are my mind, forget the corny line
Now let me hit you off with this question sign 
You seem to be the type for me to wine and dine 
A little candlelight dinner toasted over some wine 
Well, I will hit you off with this lyrical rhyme 

Now Mr. Lover keep her rockin', Mr. Lover keep her rockin'
Mr. Lover keep her rockin' and swing 
Now Mr. Lover keep her rockin', Mr. Lover keep her rockin'
Mr. Lover keep her rockin' and swing 


Ooh boy, I love you so 
Never, ever, ever gonna let you go
(That's right) 
Once I get my hands on you 
(Luv me, luv me, luv me sex machine) 
Ooh boy, I love you so
(Mmm hmm) 
Never, ever, ever gonna let you go 
(That's right, uh) 
I hope you feel the same way too
(You know dat) 

Step in my caravan of love 
So I can love, gonna give you hotter rubs 
Dem ever wet kissies wit' dem brazen hugs 
And now your sweet, silky body on my Persian rug 
While we sippin' Coke from da same ol' mug 
I'm readin' fortune cookies from the Chines proverb 
It had some great stuff written in it with some cool rub-a-dub 
A little ol' reminisce in the hot tub, huh 


Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover 
(Let's fog up some window sills, girl, uh) 
Mr. Lover 
(Catch a groove back girl, catch a groove) 
Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover

Girl, you're unique 
Now let me take a whiff of that sweet physique 
You're the only girl allowed to make my heart stop beatin' 
Let me, ha, ha, start lickin' (?), let's kick it heartlessly 
To be the lady of your color is an honor indeed 
Leave a lastin' impression for weeks and weeks 
I want to throw rose petals to your humble feet 
Lay you gently on my sheet and sexercise you to sleep, huh 


Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover 
(Uh, yeah) 
Mr. Lover 
(Catch a groove back girl, catch a groove) 
Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover 
Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover 
(Let's fog up some window sills, baby) 




The ladies still want me, hot like fire 
If you come wit' me, you, me, can retire 
Anytime you model girl, an instant fire 
Somehow your power with Tommy Hilfiger 
'Nuff dat designer wan' know your name 
'Nuff of dem a put your picture in a picture frame 
Wanna feel your body, man can't put no fame 
Some model, of mi girl, and go enjoy your fame 

Luv me, luv me, luv me, sex machine 
I'm guaranteed to make you moan and scream 
Luve me, luv me, luv me, sex machine 
I'm guaranteed to make you moan and scream 
Luv me, luv me, luv me, sex machine

Luv me, luv me, luv me, sex machine
