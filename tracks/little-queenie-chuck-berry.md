Lord, I got lumps in my throat
When I saw her comin' down the aisle
I got the wiggles in my knees
When she looked at me and sweetly smiled

There she is again, she's standin' over by the record machine
My god she's lookin' like a model on the cover of a magazine
She's too cute to be a minute over seventeen
Meanwhile I was thinkin'

She's in the mood, no need to break it
I need a chance, I may go take it
Come on, Queenie, let's shake it
Give it to me honey, don't break it

Go, go, go, Little Queenie
Go, go, go, Little Queenie
Go, go, go, Little Queenie

There she is again, she's standin' over by the record machine
My god she's lookin' like a model on the cover of a magazine
She's too cute to be a minute over seventeen
Meanwhile I was still thinkin'

If this is a slow song, we'll omit it
If this is a rocker, that'll get it
If it's good, I'll admit it
Come here Queenie, let's get with it

Go, go, go, Little Queenie
Go, go, go, Little Queenie
Go, go, go, Little Queenie, hey

Go, go, go, Little Queenie, hey
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go Little Queenie
Go, go, go, Little Queenie, yeah

Meanwhile I was still thinkin'
You got what I want, I'm gonna take it
C'mon baby, don't break it
Just shake it and we'll make it
Take me back Ferriday, Louisiana we'll break it

Go, Little Queenie
Go, go, Little Queenie
Go, go, go, Little Queenie

I said go, go, go, Little Queenie
Go, go, go, Little Queenie
Go, go, go, Little Queenie
