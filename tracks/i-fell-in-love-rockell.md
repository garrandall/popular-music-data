1 - I fell in love, gave you my heart
You turned your back, and walked out on me
I once was blind, but now I see
And I'm so glad you set me free

Repeat 1

You used to be mine

Set me free, set me free, set me free
Free, free, free

I fell in love

Set me free, set me free, set me free
Free, free, free

You used to be mine
But now it has gone away, gone away
A love so divine
And I used to think that I could not stand on my own
Something about the way you touch me, baby, made me crazy

But now that you're on your way
Don't think for a second I want you to stay, oh

2 - Maybe I'm falling, a warning
Boy let me show you how it's going down
Just keep on walking, nobody talking
I don't have no time to play around

Repeat 1

I used to be loved
But now I'm all alone
So all alone
And don't tell me how much you got
'Cause when I needed you, you weren't there, so

Repeat 2
Repeat 1 to fade
