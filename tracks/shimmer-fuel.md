She calls me from the cold
Just when I was low, feeling short of stable
All that she intends
And all she keeps inside isn't on the label

She says she's ashamed
And can she take me for awhile?
And can I be a friend
We'll forget the past but maybe I'm not able
And I break at the bend

We're here and now
Will we ever be again
'Cause I have found
All that shimmers in this world is sure to fade away again

She dreams a champagne dream
Strawberry surprise, pink linen and white paper
Lavender and cream
Fields of butterflies, reality escapes her

She says that love is for fools who fall behind
And I'm somewhere between
I never really know a killer from a savior
'Til I break at the bend

We're here and now
Will we ever be again
'Cause I have found
All that shimmers in this world is sure to fade away again

It's too far away for me to hold too far away
It's too far away for me to hold too far away

It's too far away for me to hold too far away
It's too far away for me to hold too far away
It's too far away for me to hold too far away
It's too far away for me to hold too far away

Guess I'll let it go
