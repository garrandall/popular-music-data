IF I HAD MY WISH TONIGHT
David Lasley
Don't look at me
Cause I'm crying over you
Please don't look at me
My tears are fallin like water over a waterfall
Please don't talk to me
There's just nothin left to say
Please don't talk to me
My voice is shakin and I'm not
Makin much sense at all, oh
I may never get over you but I'll try
Even if it takes my whole life through
Cause that's how long I'll cry
I wish I may I wish I might
Have this wish I wish tonight
So bad
Instead of being so sad and lonely
You would want me
If I had my wish tonight
If I had my wish tonight
Don't touch me again
Cause I'm dying over you
Please don't touch me again
I know your feelings are just not as real
As I hoped they'd be
Please don't look at me
