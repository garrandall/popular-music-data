I know why birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by
Just like me, ooh
They long to be close to you

On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And they decided to
Create a dream come true

So they sprinkled moondust in your hair
And that's why, baby, I love you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

Oh, all the guys in town, yeah
Follow you all around
Yes, they do, yes, they do
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

I said just like me, ooh
They long to be close to you

On the day that you were born
Those smart angels got together
And they decided to
Create a dream come true

So they sprinkled moondust in your hair
And that's why, baby, I love you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

That's why all
All the guys in town, yeah
Follow you all around
Yes, they do, you know they do
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

I wonder can we moan
Oooh, oh, baby, oooh
Close to you, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

That's where I wanna be
That's where I have to be
Oooh, close to you

I wanna be there
I wanna be there, baby...
