In an upstairs room in Blackpool
By the side of a Northern Sea
The army had my father
And my mother was having me

Military madness
Was killing my country
Solitary sadness
Comes over me

And after the school was over
And I moved to the other side
I found another country
But I never lost my pride

Military madness
Was killing the country
Solitary sadness
Creeps over me

And after the wars are over
And the body count is finally filed
I hope that man discovers
What's driving the people wild

Military madness
Is killing your country
So much sadness
Between you and me

War, war, war
War, war, war
