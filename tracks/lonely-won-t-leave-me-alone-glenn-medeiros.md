Why do I seem to be
Caught up inside a dream?
All my life
It`s always been my shadow and me

Over my shoulder
There`s always a voice
Somewhere saying
I never should try to set my heart free

I wish that love would come
And take me in her arms
And show me what I've never known

Where I could hold someone
And words like right and wrong
Just fade away like yesterday


Lonely won't leave me alone
Lonely won't leave me alone
Why?
Tell me why?
Won`t even let me fall in love

Oh
Everywhere I go
Always by my side
Won't even let me fall in love


I try and say I love you
But the words won't come through
When my eyes see all the tears
And sad memories

Why can't I start out new
And leave that old feeling too?
Far behind
I guess that lonely needs company

Around each bend of road
I`m thinking back in time
There will be that rainbow's end

But when I follow love
Self delusions I find
That it's only lonely and me again
