Jeannie Ortega, Papoose
Imma show you how itâs supposed to be done, uh


Donât get me started, itâs getting kinda crowded in here
Back up off me, Iâm feeling like Iâm suffocating
Now hereâs my problem, Iâm not gonna be your chick on the side
Forget about it, you know damn well it wouldnât be right
I donât know what you been thinking bout me
Did you think this was gonna be that easy?
Hell no you must be going crazy


Why donât you get out of my life, get out of my sight
Get off of my back.
Why donât you get back to your world, Go back to your girl
I think you owe her.
I know whatâs going on
I wonât be second to none
Back off 'cause youâre crowding my space
You need to get out of my face


Letâs be honest Iâm not the type of chick you can use
And if you want it, if you want it youâll have to choose
Oh Iâve been through this, been cheated on I know how it feels
How would I know that, you wouldn't do the same to me.
I donât know what you been thinking bout me
Did you think this was gonna be that easy?
Hell no you must be going crazy


Why donât you get out of my life, get out of my sight
Get off of my back.
Why donât you get back to your world, Go back to your girl
I think you owe her.
I know whatâs going on
I wonât be second to none
Back off 'cause youâre crowding my space
You need to get out of my face


Bk, Bk Uh
They say you canât have your cake and eat it too
Tell me whatâs the meaning?
Whatâs the sense of me having cake if I canât eat it?
Cheaters never win my friend
You like creeping but hate when your girl start cheating
Imagine if you came home to your wife
Opens your door and locked it then you found R. Kelly hiding in your closet
I knew you would start cheating before you even stopped it
Unlike when you double your money Iâm a profit
Albert Einstein was smart but Iâm so wiser
Iâm a ladies man, your man is a womanizer
You gotta fight for love, can you make a fist
Since your name is Jeannie, can I make a wish?
Donât mind your setbacks, every move major
Growing for me hey just do me one favor
He put you on the side lemme be your savior
Crowded, Papoose, Jeannie Ortega


Why donât you get out of my life, get out of my sight
Get off of my back.
Why donât you get back to your world, Go back to your girl
I think you owe her.
I know whatâs going on
I wonât be second to none
Back off 'cause youâre crowding my space
You need to get out of my face

Get out of my life, get out of my sight, get off of my back
Cause youâre crowding my space
You need to get out of my face.
