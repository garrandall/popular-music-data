Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glenn to glenn and down the mountain side
The summer's gone and all the roses falling
It's you, It's you must go and I must bide.

Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, the pipes are calling
From glenn to glenn and even down the mountain side
The summer's gone and all the roses falling
It's you, It's you must go and I must bide.

Well, come on back when summer's in the meadow
When the valley's hushed and even white with snow
Hey, I'll be there in sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy I love you so.

Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, the pipes are calling
From glenn to glenn and even down the mountain side
The summer's gone and all the roses falling
It's you, It's you must go and I must bide.

Well, come on back when summer's in the meadow
When the valley's hushed and even white with snow
Hey, I'll be there in sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy I love you so.

Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy I love you so.
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy I love you so...
