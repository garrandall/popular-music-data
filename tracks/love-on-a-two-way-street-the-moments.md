I found love on a two way street and lost it on a lonely highway
Love on a two way street and lost it on a lonely highway

True love will never die, so I've been told, but now I must cry
It's finally goodbye, I know

With music softly playing, his lips were gently saying: "I love you"

He held me in desperation, I thought it was a revelation
And then he walked out

How could I be so blind, to give up love for the very first time
To be fooled is a hurting pain, to be loved and fooled
Is a crying shame, while I bear the blame as he laughs my name

With music softly playing, his lips were gently saying: "Honey, I love you."
He held me in desperation, I thought it was a revelation
And then he walked out

I found love on a two way street and lost it on a lonely highway
Love on a two way street and lost it on a lonely highway

I found love on a two way street and lost it on a lonely highway
Love on a two way street and lost it on a lonely highway
