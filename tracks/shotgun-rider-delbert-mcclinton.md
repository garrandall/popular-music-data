When the sun comes up
I got to leave this town
But I love you layin' here with me
I'd like to stay
But I can't hang around
So if you'd like to, come with me

And be my shotgun rider, my love provider
Life is so lonely on the road
Be my, my shotgun rider, sweet love provider
And be my shelter from the pain and the cold, honey

Well, the way I live
I always travel light
And I've done my lovin' on the run
I don't know what you did to me
But I know you did it right
Baby, please don't stop, we've just begun

And be my shotgun rider, my love provider
I need you with me down the road
Be my shotgun rider, sweet love provider
And be my shelter from the pain and the cold, honey

Shotgun rider, shotgun rider
