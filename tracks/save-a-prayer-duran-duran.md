You saw me standing by the wall
Corner of a main street
And the lights are flashing
On your window sill
All alone ain't much fun
So you're looking for the thrill
And you know just what it takes
And where to go


Don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after
No, don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after


Feel the breeze deep on the inside
Look you down into your well
If you can, you'll see the world
In all his fire
Take a chance like all dreamers
You can't find another way
You don't have to dream it all
Just live a day


Don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after
No, don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after


Pretty looking road
I try to hold the rising floods
That fill my skin
Don't ask me why
I'll keep my promise
Melt the ice


And you wanted to dance
So I asked you to dance
But fear is in your Soul
Some people call it
A one night stand
But we can call it paradise


Don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after
No, don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after


Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do


Save a prayer 'til the morning after
Save a prayer 'til the morning after
Save a prayer 'til the morning after
Save a prayer 'til the morning after...
