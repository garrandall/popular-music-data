Listen to a lonely sound
See the gray and sadness all around
See the people go their way
Care not of me and love I've lost today

Maybe tomorrow, I will love again
I'll never know until I looked into her eyes
Maybe tomorrow, I will love again
I'll never know until I've seen her once or twice

And so I'm living for a dream
Each lonely day spent looking for the sunshine
I make believe that I don't care
I tell my friends I love my life I'm happy

Maybe tomorrow, I will love again
I'll never know until I looked into her eyes
Maybe tomorrow, I will love again
I'll never know until I've seen her once or twice

Wherever, whoever you may be
Let the light of your love

Shine through the window of my heart
Then when you've colored all thoughts bright
Don't let me ever, ever thing of night, no-oo yeah

Maybe tomorrow, you will love again
I'll never know until I look into her eyes
Maybe, tomorrow, you will love again
I'll never know until I've seen her once or twice

Maybe tomorrow, you will love again
Maybe tomorrow, I will love!
