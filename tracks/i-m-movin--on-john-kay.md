I warned ya, baby
From time to time
But you just wouldn't listen
Wouldn't pay me no mind

So I'm movin' on
I'm rollin' on
You've broken your vow
And it's all over now
I'm movin' on

That big eight wheeler
Movin' down the track
Means your true loving daddy
Ain't comin' back

I'm movin' on
I'm rollin' on
You're flyin' too high
For my little sky
I'm movin' on

Well someday, baby
When you had your play
You're gonna want your daddy
But your daddy will say

Keep on movin'
Keep rollin' on
I'm through with you
Too bad you're blue
'Cause I'm movin' on

Mister Engineer
Take the throttle in hand
And take me down to that
Southern land

Keep movin' on
Keep rollin' on
Just to ease my mind
Get me there on time
Movin' on

Mister Fireman please
Won't ya listen to me
Cause I got a pretty woman
In Tennessee

Keep movin' on
Keep rollin' on
She's fine as can be
And she's waitin' on me
Keep movin' on

I'm gonna move
I'm gonna move
I'm gonna move
Move

(Yes, I'm moving)
Every day (yes, I'm moving)
And every night (yes, I'm moving)
And all the time (yes, I'm moving)

Ah move (yes, I'm moving)
Ah move (yes, I'm moving)
Yeah move (yes, I'm moving)
Yeah move (yes, I'm moving)
(Yes, I'm moving)
(Yes, I'm moving)
