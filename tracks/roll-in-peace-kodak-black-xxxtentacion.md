I can't even smoke in peace
I can't even go to sleep
Omg
I don't even power trip
This ain't power But You ghost to me
Don't get close to me
Hugging my Rosary
I say lord
Mama would hustle
The Honda Accord
Daddy would stunt
He would pull up at ac
Fancy Rolex
With a Cuban to match
Back when they call me young nene the kid
Back I use to put on the throwback
Back when I use to just play the backcourt
Back when I use to wear the jansport
I don't got books in there
Just the rhyme book I swear
Pull up to the show
And queens and Brooklyn here
Yeah you know it
Baby I'm a poet
Playa playa
And I play heroic
I ain't saving hoes
Screaming fuck the labels
As I walk in label door
I'm a labor man
I'm a work horse
Even when I stay at home
I don't never take work off
Before I sweat a bitch
I rather porn Hub
And Just jerk off
You a jerk off
Like stone cold
With a six pack
With the beer belly
And the shirt off
Hit with the stunner
Man I just had the worse summer
So I'm kicking doors
And breaking numbers
Kicking like the baby
In your baby mama
She Gon make hit with the anacoda
Bless her with the force and some marijuana
With no Benny Hanna
Just some chicken nuggets

Gucci gold
I Told her
To give me the coochie to go
I told her to rub
On my coogie for luck
I told her
Don't act like she booshie as fuck
I told her
Go listen to Gucci instead
I got me a yella
She bump the Kodak
I met her miami
That night in the sand
I told her to read all the signs in my hand
She told me the vision was safe and clear
She wanted a Kodak
A pic from the gram
She told me I was becoming a man
The picture Was only because I'm the man
I was just a baby boy
Getting picked up at the crib
Getting dropped off at my school
In my mama green ass van
