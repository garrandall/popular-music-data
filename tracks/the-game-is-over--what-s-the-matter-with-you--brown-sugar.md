What's the matter with you
You don't smile anymore
What's the matter with you
You've forgotten my name for sure

You held me in your arms
You thrilled me with all your charms
Now that you got what you wanted
You say


The game is over (game is over)
Game is over, game's over
How could I win when I
Never even knew I played

(Never, never, never
Never knew I played
Never, never, never
Never knew I played
Never, never, never
Never knew I played)

What's the matter with you
You don't want my love anymore
What's the matter with you
You're walking toward the door

You held me in your arms
You thrilled me with all your charms
Now that you got what you wanted
You say



(Never, never, never
Never knew I played
Never, never, never
Never knew I played
Never, never, never
Never knew I played)

You held me in your arms
You thrilled me with all your charms
Now that you got what you wanted
You say

It's over (game is over)
The game's over
The game is over
Now tell me how could I win
When I never even knew I played

(Never, never, never
Never knew I played
Never, never, never
Never knew I played...
