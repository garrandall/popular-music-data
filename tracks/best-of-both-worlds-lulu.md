Best of both worlds, that's what you want
All your own way, that's not my way
I won't share you, I couldn't bear to
It's time for you to choose
Which love you'd rather lose

Could you love her and forget me?
Are you sorry that you've met me?
What we've been through means nothing to you
I can't satisfy you
You want best of both worlds

Make your fickle mind up
I won't stay while you enjoy
Best of both worlds

I have loved you since I've found you
You belong here, just look around you
Keep your true love or take your new love
You must chose between us
You want best of both worlds

Make your fickle mind up
I won't stay while you enjoy
Best of both worlds

You've gotta choose between us
You can't have the two of us

Make your fickle mind up
I won't stay while you enjoy
Best of both worlds - best of both worlds
Best of both worlds
