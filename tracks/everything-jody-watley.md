Lucky, lucky me
I've got my hands on you
I had to wait around
But finally I'm the lucky one
I knew it from the start
That you would break my heart
Still I insist today
I wouldn't have it any other way

I ain't mad at you, oh, no
For running your game
In fact I can't blame you
It was my idea to play
There's no use pretending
I'm not letting go
I think I should you want you
I think that you should know

It makes me moan
When we're alone
Alone, just me and you
(With you, boy)
I'm so at home
'Cause you're the bomb
With everything you do
So would you mind
If you had the time
If I can't deal with you
Don't change a thing
I'll try and hang
With everything you do, boy

Lucky, lucky you
You got your cake and ate it too
They label me the fool
I label me the lucky one
You captivate my heart
You cast your spell on me
You waved your magic wand
Now I'm feeling like the lucky one

I ain't mad at you, hey, man
For running your game
In fact I can't blame you
It was my idea to play
There's no use pretending
I'm not letting go
I think I should you want you
I think that you should know

It makes me moan
When we're alone
Alone, just me and you
(Ooh-ooh-ooh...)
I'm so at home
'Cause you're the bomb
With everything you do
So would you mind
If you had the time
If I can't deal with you
Don't change a thing
I'll try and hang
With everything you do, boy

It makes me moan
When we're alone
Alone, just me and you
I'm so at home
'Cause you're the bomb
With everything you do
(Ooh-ooh-ooh...)
So would you mind
If you had the time
If I can't deal with you
Don't change a thing
I'll try and hang
With everything you do, boy

Mmm-mmm, you're the bomb
With everything you do, boy

It makes me moan
When we're alone
Alone, just me and you
I'm so at home
'Cause you're the bomb
With everything you do
So would you mind
If you had the time
If I can't deal with you
(Ooh-ooh...)
Don't change a thing
I'll try and hang
With everything you do, boy

It makes me moan
When we're alone
Alone, just me and you
I'm so at home
'Cause you're the bomb
With everything you do
So would you mind
If you had the time
If I can't deal with you
Don't change a thing
I'll try and hang
With everything you do, boy
