I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong
To crash the critic saying, “Is it right or is it wrong?”
If only fame had an IV
Baby, could I bear being away from you
I found the vein, put it in here


I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause


Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch (Make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch (Make it real loud)


A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (Make it real loud)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (Make it real loud)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch


I've overheard your theory “Nostalgia's for geeks”
I guess sir if you say so
Some of us just like to read
One second I'm a Koons, then suddenly the Koons is me
Pop culture was in art, now art’s in pop culture, in me


I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause


Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch (Make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch (Make it real loud)


A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (Make it real loud)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (Make it real loud)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch


Woo...
Touch, touch
Woo...
Touch, touch, now
Woo-oh-oh-oh...


I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause


Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch (Make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch (Make it real loud)


A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (Make it real loud)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (Make it real loud)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch


A-R-T-P-O-P
