Superfruit, oh, Gaga
I've had a little bit too much (o-o-o-o)
All of the people start to rush, start to rush babe
A dizzy twister dance
Can't find my drink or man
Where are my keys?
I lost my phone (o-o-o-o)

Just dance!
Gonna be okay
(Dada doo doot-n)
Just dance!
Spin that record babe
(Da da doo doot-n)
Just dance!
Gonna be okay
J-j-just dance, dance, dance, just
J-j-just dance!

Let's have some fun this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Let's play a lovegame, play a lovegame
Do you want love, or you want fame
Are you in the game, dans le lovegame

Let's play a lovegame, play a lovegame
Do you want love, or you want fame
Are you in the game, dans le lovegame

Can't read my
Can't read my
He can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)

I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi (she's got me like nobody)

P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face

I don't speak German but I can if you like (ow) 

Rah rah rah-ah-ah!
Ro mah ro-mah-mah
Gaga oh-la-la!
Want your bad romance

I want your love and
I want your revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I want your love and
All your lover's revenge
You and me could write a bad romance

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh-oh!
Want your bad romance
(Caught in a bad romance)
Want your bad romance

Just a second
It's my favourite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with
A drink in my hand, eh-eh-eh-eh

Stop callin', stop callin'
I don't wanna think any more
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

I know that we are young
And I know that you may love me
But I just can't be with you like this anymore
Alejandro

She's got both hands
In her pocket
And she won't look at you, won't look at you, no
She hides true love
En su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger
Around you

Show me your teeth, (Alejandro, Alejandro) oh
Show me your (Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro)

I'm gonna marry the night
I won't give up on my life
I'm a warrior queen
Live passionately tonight
I'm gonna marry the night

I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way, hey

Oh there ain't no other way
Baby I was born this way
Oh, right track, baby
I was born this way

Judas, Juda-a-as
Judas, Juda-a-as
Judas, Juda-a-as
Gaga-a

There ain't no reason you and me should be alone 
Tonight yeah baby, tonight yeah baby 
I got a reason that you-hoo should take me home tonight
Alright (alright)

I'm on the edge of glory, and I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you

You and I, oh, you and I
Woah, you and I, woah
You and I-I

I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause
Live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

Venus (G.U.Y.)
I wanna be that guy (G.U.Y.)
I wanna be that guy (G.U.Y.)
I wanna be that guy (G.U.Y.)
The girl under you guy, (guy)

It wasn't love,
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)

I'll undress you, 'cause you're tired
Cover you as you desire
When you fall asleep inside my arms
May not have the fancy things
But I'll give you everything
You could ever want, it's in my arms

And I bow down to pray
I try to make the worse seem better
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

I will be right by your side

If I can't find the cure, I'll
I'll fix you with my love
No matter what you know, I'll
I'll fix you with my love
And if you say you're okay
I'm gonna heal you anyway
Promise I'll always be there
Promise I'll be the cure (be the cure)
Oh, (no) be the cure (cure) yea, yea 

I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay
