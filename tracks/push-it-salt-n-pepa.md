Ah, push it

Oooh, baby, baby
Baby, baby
Oooh, baby, baby
Baby, baby

Get up on this!

Ah, push it

Ah, push it (ow, get up on this)
Ah, push it (get up on this)

Ow baby
Salt and Pepa's here
Salt, Salt, Salt, Salt and Pepa's here
Salt, Salt, Salt, Salt, Salt, Salt and Pepa's here
Salt and, Salt and, Salt and Pepa's here
Salt, Salt, Salt, Salt and Pepa's here

(Now wait a minute, y'all; This dance ain't for everybody
Only the sexy people
So all you fly mothers, get on out there and dance
Dance, I said!)

Salt and Pepa's here, and we're in effect
Want you to push it, babe
Coolin' by day then at night working up a sweat
C'mon girls, let's go show the guys that we know
How to become number one in a hot party show
Now push it

Ah, push it - push it good
Ah, push it - push it real good
Ah, push it - push it good
Ah, push it - p-push it real good

Hey! Ow!
Push it good!

Oooh, baby, baby
Baby, baby
Oooh, baby, baby
Ba-baby, baby

Push it good
Push it real good
Ah, push it
Ah, push it

Yo, yo, yo, yo, baby-pop
Yeah, you come here, give me a kiss
Better make it fast or else I'm gonna get pissed
Can't you hear the music's pumpin' hard like I wish you would?
Now push it

Push it good
Push it real good
Push it good
P-push it real good

Ah, push it
Get up on this!
Ah, get up on this!
Ah ah, get up on this!
Ow, get up on this! (hid it)
Boy you really got me going
You got me so I don't know what I'm doing
Ah, push it
Ah, push it
Boy you really got me going
You got me so I don't know what I'm doing
Ah, push it
Ah, push it

Ah
Ah, push it
Push it push push it push it
Push it, push push push  it, push it
Push it, push it, push it push it push it
Push it, push it, push it push it push it
