All of my life
I've used the earth as a pillow and the sky as a blanket of blue
Now all that I own
Is the shirt on my back and the blanket and the saddle on you
So Mare take me home
Mare take me home
Mare take me home
Mare take me home

And I spent some time in jail
But then my face turned pale and my health it started to fail
So the sheriff he let me go
And then the townspeople caught me and they ran me out of town on a rail
Mare take me home
Mare take me home
Mare take me home
Mare take me home

Mare carry me
Take me back down to the place where I want to be
Cause home's where I should go
And I never want to travel that god-forsaken trail no more
So Mare take me home
Mare take me home
Mare take me home
Mare take me home

Well Mare take me home
Mare take me home
Mare take me home
Mare take me home
