White birds, blue skies
Lay in the sand with a bottle of wine
Paralyzed like a sleeping giant
Baby, I've been drinkin' all night

Good times, we had
Still remember all the kisses we shared
Help me, 'cause my hands are tied
Tell me when I'll see you again
See you again

My love, you've got me so confused
I wrote you letters
My heart is beating fast and
Far too long

I wanna' see you tonight
Make it up, but it's all a good time

Nice girl, dressed in black
Tell me all of the secrets you hide
Help me play the sugar cane
Baby, I wanna see you again
See you again

Nothing could take me away from you
I'm watchin' you dancin'
My heart is beating fast and
Far too long

I want you t-t-t-t-t-tonight
Make it up, but it's all a good time

I dream, night after night
Way too much almost every time
'Cause I think you'll like
Baby, I don't lie
I just wanna see you tonight

If you go, how do you deal with days of love?
A change in times, tappin' on my guitar
And don't you worry, I'll never be a stranger
We up for each other
Baby, what a night, so long

White birds, blue skies
Lay in the sand with a bottle of wine
Paralyzed like a sleeping giant
Baby, I've been drinkin' all night
