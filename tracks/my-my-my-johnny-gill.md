Yeah!
So good
My, my, my, my
You look so sweet
Listen


Put on your red dress and slip on your high heels
And some of that sweet perfume, it sure smells good on you
Slide on your lipstick, and let all your hair down
'Cause baby, when you get through I'm gonna show off you


Tonight will be a special night
No matter where we go
And I'm so proud to be with you
I just want to let you know


You got my sayin' my, my, my, my, my, my
You sure look good tonight
And you're so damn fine
I wanna say my, my, my, my, my, my (Uh-huh)
You sure look good tonight (Tonight, after all this time)


Slip on your nightgown, step in our bedroom
First I wanna take some time, I just wanna look at you
Girl, you are so fine, I can't believe my eyes
And all that I wanna do, I wanna make love to you, oh


Tonight will be a special night
A minute more to come
And I'm so proud to be with you
So proud to share your love


My, my, my, my, my, my
You sure look good tonight
I wanna say my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Make love all night long, make love till the break of dawn
Come on, come on
Sweet little thing, yes, you do

And I'm so proud to be with you
So proud to share you're love


You got my singin' my, my, my, my, my, my
You sure look good tonight
I wanna love you, I want to love you in every, every way
Let me, let me show you how sweet it's gonna be
I wanna show you things that you never
You never, ever, ever seen before


Put your nightgown on
Let your hair hang low
Step into our room
I'm in the mood to love you all night long


You got me sayin' my, my, my, my, my, my, my
My, my, my, my, my, my, my
My, my, my, my, my, my, m-m-m-my, my, my, my, my
My, my, my, my, my, my
See, all you got to do, all you gotta do
Is say that you'll be mine, all mine, all mine, all mine, all mine
You'll be all mine tonight, baby
Let me, let me show you how sweet it's gonna, whoa


My, my, my, my, my, my
You sure look good tonight
My, my, my, my, my, my
You sure look good tonight
My, my, my, my, my, my
You sure look good tonight
My, my, my, my, my, my!
