One day the boy decided to let them know the way he felt inside
He could not stand to hide it, his mother she broke down and cried

Oh my father
Why don't you talk to me now?
Oh my mother
Do you still cry yourself to sleep?
Are you still proud of your little boy?

Don't be afraid (be afraid)
You don't have to hideaway

The boy he was rejected by the people that he cared for
It's not what they expected but he could not keep it secret anymore

Far from home now
Waiting by the telephone
There's a new world
You can't make it on your own
Are you still proud of your little boy?

Don't be afraid (be afraid)
You don't have to hideaway
No

Don't be afraid
Love will mend your broken wings
Time will slip away
Learn to be brave

Oh my father
Why don't you talk to me now?
Oh my mother
Do you still cry yourself to sleep?
Are you still proud of your little boy?

Don't be afraid (be afraid)
You don't have to hideaway
No

Don't be afraid
Love will mend your broken wings
Time will slip away
Learn to be brave
