I remember when I first saw him
Something told me that I couldn't ignore him
And I've been dreamin' of him every night
Ever since we met

'Cause he's the kind of boy you can't forget
(He's the kind of boy you can't forget)

I remember when I first kissed him
He touched my hand and then I couldn't resist him
And though he kissed me 'bout a week ago
I ain't got over it yet

'Cause he's the kind of boy you can't forget
(He's the kind of boy you can't forget)

Wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo
I could be so happy knowing he was mine
(Yeah, yeah, yeah), all the time
And I could make him happy
I would treat him good, yes I would, wo, wo
Wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo
Hey!

Gotta tell him that I adore him
There is nothin' that I wouldn't do for him
I won't be happy till I make him mine
And a wedding day is set

'Cause he's the kind of boy you can't forget
(He's the kind of boy you can't forget)
