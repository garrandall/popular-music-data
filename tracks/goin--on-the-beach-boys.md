Oo oo oo oo going on


When in the morning
I must arise
I look in the mirror
It couldn't be clearer
Something is gone from my eyes


Going on
Going on
Going on


I know what is missing
Because since you've been gone
My mind keeps on reeling (mind keeps on reeling)
My heart keeps on feeling (heart keeps on feeling)
Why is my love going on (going on)




I love you
I miss you
Things won't be the same till I kiss you
I'm empty
Without you
My heart's full with my arms about you
Ooo oo oo ah ah ah
We said it was over
We're living apart
We couldn't quite make it (couldn't quite make it)
But still I can't shake it (but still I can't shake it)
Our love still lives on in my heart (in my heart)

I love you
Forever
Love won't be the same again ever (same again ever)
Without you (without you)
I'm longing (I'm longing)
You gave me a sense of belonging
Oo oo oo oo oo going on
Why is my love going on (goin on)

I love you
I miss you
I'm sorry
Forgive me (won't you forgive me)
Believe me (believe me)
My lover (my lover)
There never could be any other
Ooo oo oo
Going on


Come be my
Redeemer
Awaken me beautiful dreamer (beautiful dreamer)
I love you (I love you)
I miss you (I miss you)
Things won't be the same till I'm with you
Ah
