Freedom for the stallion, freedom for the mare and her colt
Freedom for the baby child who has not grown old enough to vote
Lord, have mercy, what you gonna do about the people who are prayin' to you?
They got men makin' laws that destroy other men, made money, God, it's a doggone sin
Oh, Lord, you got to help us find the way
Big ship's a-sailin', slaves all chained and bound
Headin' for a brand new land that someone said he up and found
Lord, have mercy, what you gonna do about the people who are prayin' to you?
They got men makin' laws that destroy other men, they made money, God, it's a doggone sin
Oh, Lord, you got to help us find the way
Freedom for the stallion, freedom for the mare and her colt
Freedom for the baby child who has not grown old enough to vote
Lord, have mercy, what you gonna do about the people who are prayin' to you?
You know when I look inside my mind searchin' for the truth I find
Oh, Lord, you got to help us find the way
Hey, Lord!
