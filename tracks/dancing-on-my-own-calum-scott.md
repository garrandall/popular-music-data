Somebody said you got a new friend
But does she love you better than I can?
And there's a big black sky over my town
I know where you're at, I bet she's around
And yeah I know it's stupid, but I just gotta see it for myself


I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh oh oh
And I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Oh oh oh
And I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the guy you're taking home, oh
I keep dancing on my own


I just wanna dance all night
And I’m all messed up, I’m so out of line, yeah
Stilettos and broken bottles
I’m spinning around in circles


And I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh oh oh
And I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Oh oh oh
And I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the guy you're taking home, oh
I keep dancing on my own
And oh, nah


So far away, but still so near
The lights come on, the music dies
But you don't see me standing here
I just came to say goodbye


I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh
And I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the guy you're taking home, oh
I keep dancing on my own
And oh, nah
Said I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh​ no
And I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Oh no
And I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the guy you're taking home, oh
And I keep dancing on my own


So far away, but still so near
The lights come on, the music dies
But you don't see me standing here
