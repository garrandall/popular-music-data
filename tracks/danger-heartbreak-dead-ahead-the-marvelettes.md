When you give more than you get, you're in danger (you're in danger)
You may find that you're in love with a stranger (with a stranger)
For who knows what evil lurks within the hearts of men?
It's vanity, insanity to play when you can't win
When you find that you're losing, it's time to get on moving
Cause there's danger: heartbreak dead ahead

It only takes one second, girl, to learn (to learn)
That playing with fire will get you burned (get you burned)
Now girl, don't you be foolish
They say that love is blind, but it's clear as the highway sign
That reads "Danger: heartbreak dead ahead"
Heartbreak dead ahead

Read the sign, girl; you'd better mind, girl
Yeah, danger: heartbreak dead ahead

Once the lying starts, start packing up your heart
Listen to me, girl
When there's nothing to be gained, don't keep goin' on in vain
Cause there's danger: heartbreak dead ahead
I said there's danger, I said there's danger
