Heartbeat
Why do you miss when my baby kisses me?
Heartbeat
Why does a love kiss stay in my memory?

Piddly pat
I know that new love thrills me
I know that true love will be

Heartbeat
Why do you miss when my baby kisses me?

Heartbeat
Why do you skip when my baby's lips meet mine?
Heartbeat
Why do you flip and give me a skip each sign?

Piddly pat
And sing to me love's story
And bring to me love's glory

Heartbeat
Why do you miss when my baby kisses me?
