Hey man, good to see you


Yeah Shorty, how you been?
Wow, the place sure is hot tonight!


It's the Rooster Tail, Alice.
It's always hot there.


Hey, who is that girl over there?


Which girl?


The fine one over there...

The one who's wearing those pearls and diamond rings
She got tattoos on her arms and everything
She's the devil with a blue dress, blue dress, blue dress
Devil with a blue dress on
Yeah, she's a devil with the blue dress, blue dress, blue dress
Devil with a blue dress on

Fee fee fi fi fo fo fum
Look at Molly now, well here she comes
Wearin' her wig hat and shades to match
She got the high heel shoes and an alligator hat

Not too skinny, not too fat
She's a real humdinger and I like it like that
Devil with a blue dress, blue dress, blue dress
Devil with a blue dress on, here she comes now

Devil with a blue dress, blue dress, blue dress
Devil with a blue dress on
Devil with a blue dress, blue dress, blue dress
Devil with a blue dress on

Chains of love won't set me free
Chains of love won't let me be

Try to get up in the morning
But I just can't make it
Yeah you got a spell on me, babe
And I just can't break it
Got to love on my backside
And I just can't shake it

Yeah I'm suffering from a heartache
Hey hey

Chains of love won't set me free
Chains of love won't let me be

Well, I need your sweet love, baby
I need it so bad
But there's a voice in my soul, baby
You're the best I ever had
Yeah, I can't get to sleep, baby
And it's driving me mad

Ain't nothing but a heartache
Hey hey

Chains of love won't let me be
Chains of love baby
Chains of love won't let me be
Chains of love baby

Chains of love won't let me be
Chains of love baby
Chains of love won't let me be
Chains of love baby

'Cause you're the devil with a blue dress, blue dress, blue dress
Devil with a blue dress on
Devil with a blue dress, blue dress, blue dress
Devil with a blue dress on
