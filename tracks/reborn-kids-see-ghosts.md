I'm soâI'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
I'm soâI'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward


Very rarely do you catch me out
Ya'll done "specially invited guest"'d me out
Y'all been tellin' jokes that's gon' stress me out
Soon as I walk in, I'm like, "Let's be out"
I was, off the chain, I was often drained
I was off the meds, I was called insane
What a awesome thing, engulfed in shame
I want all the rain, I want all the pain
I want all the smoke, I want all the blame
Cardio audio, let me jog your brain
Caught in the Audy Home, we was all detained
All of you Mario, it's all a game


I'm soâI'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
I'm soâI'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward

I had my issues, ain't that much I could do
But, peace is somethin' that starts with me, with me
At times, wonder my purpose
Easy then to feel worthless
But, peace is somethin' that starts with me (with me, with me)
Had so much on my mind, I didn't know where to go
I've come a long way from them hauntin' me
Had me feelin' oh so low
Ain't no stoppin' you no way
All things, the night before
Ain't no stoppin' you no way
No stress yes, I'm so blessed and-

I'm soâI'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
I'm soâI'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward

Movin' forward, movin' forward, movin' forward
Keep movin' forward (somethin's wrong)
Keep movin' forward (I don't know why)
Keep movin' forward (so long)
Keep movin' forward (sit here in the storm)
Keep movin' forward (time goes on)
Keep movin' forward (been lookin' for my way out)
Keep movin' forward (from the storm)
Keep movin' forward (which way do I go?)

I'm soâI'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward (which way do I go?)
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward (which way do I go?)
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward (which way do I go?)
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
I'm soâI'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
