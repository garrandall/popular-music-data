You got the power
To keep my fire a-burnin'
You got the power
To keep my wheels a-turnin'

You keep me hot don't stop
Give me what you got oh yeah
Turn on the juice turn loose
Ain't that no excuse oh no no no

You got the power
To keep my fire a-burnin' (burning up burning up burning up burning up)
You got the power
To keep my wheels a-turnin'

You put the strain on the brain
Girl I'm going insane oh yeah
You turn me out make it shout
What's it all about?
Turn me out make it shout

You got the power
To keep my fire a-burnin' (burning up burning up burning up burning up)
You got the power
To keep my wheels a-turnin'

And now tonight hold me tight
Feel like dynamite. oh yeah
You make me sweat soakin' wet
Ain't through nothin' yet

You got the power
To keep my fire a-burnin' (burning up burning up burning up burning up)
You got the power
To keep my wheels a-turnin'

I feel the rush when we touch
Never get enough oh no
Save the best don't go for less
Got to make it last all night all night

You got the power
To keep my fire a-burnin' (burning up burning up burning up burning up)
You got the power
To keep my wheels a-turnin'
