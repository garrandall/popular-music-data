I remember all my life
Raining down as cold as ice
Shadows of a man
A face through a window
Crying in the night
And night goes into

Morning, just another day
Happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes
I see a memory
I never realized
You made me happy

Oh, Brandy, well, you came
And you gave without taking
But I sent you away
Oh, Brandy, well, you kissed me
And stopped me from shaking
And I need you today
Oh, Brandy

I'm standing on the edge of time
I walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world
Of uphill climbing
When tears are in my mind
And nothing's rhyming

Oh, Brandy, well, you came
And you gave without taking
But I sent you away
Oh, Brandy, well, you kissed me
And stopped me from shaking
And I need you today
Oh, Brandy

(Oh, Brandy)
(Oh, Brandy)

Riding on a country bus
No one even noticed us
Yesterday's a dream
A feast of mourning
Crying on the breeze
The pain is calling

Oh, Brandy, well, you came
And you gave without taking
But I sent you away
Oh, Brandy, well, you kissed me
And stopped me from shaking
And I need you today

Oh, Brandy, well, you came
And you gave without taking
But I sent you away
Oh, Brandy, well, you kissed me
And stopped me from shaking
And I need you today
Oh, Brandy
