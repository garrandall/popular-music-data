It's just the state of the heart
I'm waiting here for you
In the state I'm in

I know your name, I told you mine
We've stopped and passed the time of day
You work in town, I work at night
That gives us six until seven to work this out

If I seem a little strange
It's just the state of the heart
I'm waiting here for you
In the state I'm in

You are the moon, I am the sea
You pull me in and gaze on down at me
I was alone, I thought I was immune
It's good to know
The door can still be open wide

If I seem a little strange
It's just the state of the heart
I'm waiting here for you
In the state I'm in

It's just the state of the heart
I wait in the dark
In the state I'm in

We get closer and closer
To falling out or falling in
I go over and over
But I can't change the state
This heart is in

If I seem a little strange
It's just the state of the heart
I'm waiting here for you
In the state I'm in
It's just the state of the heart
You know I wait in the dark
In the state I'm in

It's the state of the heart
The state of the heart
The state of the heart
The state of the heart
