Christmas time
Wake up, wake up!
It's Christmas Day!

It's everyday bro, on my Christmas Day flow
5 mill on presents in three days, never done before
Slayed all the competition man, Santa Claus is next
Man I'm repping all these gifts, bought my mom a Rolex
And it matched the bracelet too and I'm coming with the crew
We the Team 10 elves, who the hell are fricking you?
And you know I give them coal, if the internet troll
Yeah, I'm checking the list
Yeah, I'm checking it twice
Like it when she naughty tho
Like it when she nice
Like I'm hanging from the house, man
All I got this ice
Career looking like one minute rice
Career looking like Santa Paul gave you life
Watch your best friends too
'Cause when I hit it twice
Ohio's where I'm from, my Christmas is breadcrumbs
Now it's Phantoms everyday in the Cali' sun
I plugged the merch for fun, it sells out on day one
And on your Christmas list, Jake Paul is number one

It's Christmas Day bro
It's Christmas Day bro
It's Christmas Day bro
I said it's Christmas Day bro!


You know it's Nick Crompton and my Santa suit poppin'
I'm the British Santa and these gifts stay droppin'
London is my country
Team 10 reindeer bring them money
Delivering gifts like the Energizer bunny
To all of my hunnies


They know I got that money
They know I got a hunny
Out here killing like I'm Bundy
This game ain't freakin' funny
Bitch I'm buying gifts
I ain't never wrapping shit
Like Cindy Lou? Grinch who the heck are you?
I'm Santa in the store
Kids are breaking down the door
Yelling "please give me some more, more, more"


Saint Nick, bring the bunnies
Saint Nick, bring the money
Nick, on the Lambo sleigh
These haters in the way
I just say "okay"
Yeah we do this everyday, every morning, every night
It's Christmas Day bro
But it's Team 10 for life
If you don't like the clique
We can have a snowball fight, tonight


It's Christmas Day bro
It's Christmas Day bro
It's Christmas Day bro
I said it's Christmas Day bro!


I gave yo girl my gift
But spent no dough on that present
Always got my team back
You can shit eleven
Talking shit on every move
You ain't learning no lessons
Got a new whip before Christmas
I can see why you aggressive
You talking it
We doing it
Deliver it, like Santa
You see us, then you switching up your lid
Just like Hanna
I see you sleeping on us
You still got on your pajamas
Just watch me take off in that two-toe sled like a panda


It's Christmas Day bro
It's Christmas Day bro
It's Christmas Day bro
I said it's Christmas Day bro!


Yo, it's Tricky Rick
Got the competition flipped
These elves up on me
When Santa dips, I dip, we dip
He trying to get the cookies
He ain't messing with the rookie
North Pole is your home
Got a candy cane phone
Sleigh flyin' like a drone
Reindeer bought, goes on loan
Yeah, I smell good
Is that Christmas tree cologne?


Is that Christmas tree cologne?
Jingle pauling
Home alone
Now I'm in my Christmas zone
Yes, they all gifted me
But, don't grant for free
Only rock merch by me
And they ask me what I bake
Christmas cake, cake, cake
Always plug, merch link in bio
And I will see you on the 26th, cause
It's Christmas Day bro
Peace
