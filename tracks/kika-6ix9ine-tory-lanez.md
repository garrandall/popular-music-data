Bitch, we in the city on that hot shit
Lookin' for a bitty on that thot shit
Y’all ain't gettin' money, nigga, stop this
I been ’round the globe talkin' hot shit
I do my own stunts, Jackie Chan with it
I do my own stunts, Jackie Chan with it
I do my own stunts, Jackie Chan with it
I do my own stunts, Jackie Chan with it
Bitch, we in the city on that hot shit
Lookin' for a bitty on that thot shit
Y'all ain't gettin' money, nigga, stop this
I been 'round the globe talkin' hot shit
I do my own stunts, Jackie Chan with it
I do my own stunts, Jackie Chan with it
I do my own stunts, Jackie Chan with it
I do my own stunts, Jackie Chan with it


I do my own shit, I don’t need 50 niggas to roll with
Folk shit, I’m on my doley, I'm on my boss shit
I do my own shit, fuck all them niggas I used to roll with
I know you used to see me with niggas, but that’s that old shit
Real nigga, quick to pull a fucking trigger
Fed nigga's definition of a real nigga
Fuck nigga, quick to fuckin' hate, nigga
Bitch nigga, definition of a bitch nigga
Now wildin', ready for all the violence
I don’t need a nigga jacking that he riding
I got this four fifth, this shit all up on my hip
I blow that shit, now you where Bobby Shmurda's hat went!


Bitch, we in the city on that hot shit
Lookin' for a bitty on that thot shit
Y'all ain't gettin' money, nigga, stop this
I been 'round the globe talkin' hot shit
I do my own stunts, Jackie Chan with it
I do my own stunts, Jackie Chan with it
I do my own stunts, Jackie Chan with it
I do my own stunts, Jackie Chan with it


Kick her out, I'm gettin' money now, actin' funny now
Thought she love me, but she only tryna fuck me for the clout
Saw the Patek all bust down, charter run down
Bitch hit me on a touchdown, but I curved it
They be beggin' me to keep the bitch, but I don't need the bitch
Ray Charles, John Cena shit, I can't see the bitch
In the DM sendin' naked pics, Uber that bitch
But I send her in the pool even though I'm rich as shit


It's fuckin' Tr—
Oh wait, I forgot you can't say that shit
You can go start with everything else that start with a T, though
It's fuckin' Trojan
It's fuckin' Target
It's fuckin'—
Hahahaha
