Jones Beach, 1988
Come on


Do you remember or should I rewind?
To that summer when you caught my eye?
I played it cool, the weather was hot
You had the beauty & the beach on lock
With your flip flops, half shirt, short shorts, mini skirt
Walkin' on the beach, so pretty
You wasn't lookin' for a man
When you saw me in the sand
But you fell for the boy from the city


I was like "Hey, girl, can I get your number?"
I remember what you told me too
"Don't call after 10:00"
But you know that I did
Cause I couldn't stop thinkin' 'about you


I think about you in the summertime
And all the good times we had, baby
Been a few years and I can't deny
The thought of you still makes me crazy
I think about you in the summertime
I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind
My summertime


Do you remember? I'll never forget
Touchin' your body all soakin' wet
The water was cool, the feelin' was hot
Kissin' on you while the ocean rocked
In your strapless sundress
Kickin' back, no stress
As long as we was together
Cause we were feelin' young love
And we couldn't get enough
Baby, I could reminisce forever


And now I'm like
Hey, girl, don't you know I miss it?
And I wonder if you miss it too?
Never thought it would end 'til it did
Now, I'm here and I can't stop thinkin' 'about you


I think about you in the summertime
And all the good times we had, baby
Been a few years and I can't deny
The thought of you still makes me crazy
I think about you in the summertime
I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind
My summertime


(Break it down)
Summer ended, winter started
It got colder when we parted ways
(I like this part)
As the seasons change
(Now bring it, bring it back)
Winter melted, spring, I felt it
Summertime will never be the same
Without you, my summertime
My summertime


I think about you in the summertime
And all the good times we had, baby
Been a few years and I can't deny
The thought of you still makes me crazy
I think about you in the summertime
I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind
My summertime
