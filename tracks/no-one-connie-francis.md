No one ever kissed me the way that you do
And no one ever told me "I love you"
No one ever cared
No, no one ever shared
All those dreams that I dreamed would come true

No one ever hurt me the way that you do
'Cause no one ever broke my heart in two
But I'll keep on caring my whole life through
For no one, no one but you

No one ever hurt me the way that you do
'Cause no one ever broke my heart in two
But I'll keep on caring my whole life through
For no one, no one but you
