I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside, I've got the month of May
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?


My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl


I've got so much honey, the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees
Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?


My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl


Oh oh
Hey, hey, hey
Oh oh
Hey, hey, hey
Oh oh yeah


I don't need no money, fortune, or fame
I've got all the riches, baby, one man can claim
Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?


My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl
(Talkin' 'bout my girl)


I've got sunshine on a cloudy day (Woah, woah)
With my girl
I've even got the month of May
With my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
