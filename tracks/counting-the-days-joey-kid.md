Four, three, two, one

(Counting the days)
(Counting the nights)
(Counting the days)
(Counting the nights)

Things I said were wrong
I've takin' much too long
To say that I, I want you back
Always be near, oh that's a fact

I always keep on trying
I never try to deny it
That I was wrong once before
Give me a chance, I can't take this anymore

I'm counting the days
I'm counting the nights
'Til we'll be together
I'm, I'm counting the hours
I'm watching the clock
Oh, it seems like forever

(Counting the days)
(Counting the nights)
(Counting the days)
(Counting the nights)

Waiting for you now
I keep on wondering how
To win you back, why can't I dream
It's not as impossible as it seems

I always keep on trying
I never try to deny it
That I was wrong once before
Give me a chance, I can't take this anymore

I'm counting the days
I'm counting the nights
'Til we'll be together
I'm, I'm counting the hours
I'm watching the clock
Oh, it seems like forever

I haven't seen you for a long, long time
But this moment is what's on my mind
I've waited for you to say
I want you, I need you, got to have you today

(Counting the days)
(Counting the nights)
(Counting the days)
(Counting the nights)
(Counting the days)
(Counting the nights)
(Counting the days)

I'm counting the days
I'm counting the nights
'Til we'll be together
I'm, I'm counting the hours
I'm watching the clock
Oh, it seems like forever

I'm counting the days
I'm counting the nights
'Til we'll be together
I'm, I'm counting the hours
I'm watching the clock
Oh, it seems like forever

I'm counting the days
