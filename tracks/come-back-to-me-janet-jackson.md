Looking through my old drawer
Came across the letter you wrote
Said you needed time away
That was so long ago


All my life, I've waited
To see your smile again
In my mind, I've hated
Not able to let go


Come back to me
I'm begging you please
Come back to me
How I want you to
Come back to me
I'm begging you please
Come back to me


Lord knows that I have tried
To live my life as one
Friends tell me to hold on
Tough times don't last for long


My abandoned heart
Just doesn't understand
My undying love for you
Won't let me wait


Come back to me
I'm begging you please
Come back to me
I want you to
Come back to me
I'm begging you please
Come back to me
I want you to
Come back to me
Come back
I want you to
Come back to me
Come back


Please come back to me
I miss you so much
Wherever you are
I love you


All my life, I've waited
To see your smile again
In my mind, I've hated
Not able to let go
Not able to let go
No, I won't let you go, no


I don't know what else to say
No, no, no, no
