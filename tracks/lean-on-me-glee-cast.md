Sometimes in our lives
We all have pain
We all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that there's always tomorrow

Lean on me!
When you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

Please (please)
Swallow your pride (pride)
If I have things
You need to borrow
(For) for no one can fill
Those of your needs
That you won't let show

So just call (call) on me brother (hey)
When you need a hand
(When you need a hand)
We all need (need) somebody to lean on!
(I just might have a problem)
I just might have a problem
That you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on!

Lean on me (hey)
When you're not strong
(When you're not strong)
I'll be your friend
(I'll be your friend)
I'll help you carry on
(help you carry on)
For it won't be long
(oh, it won't be long)
'Til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on

(Just lean on me)
You just call on me brother (hey)
When you need a hand
(when you need a hand)
We all need (need) somebody to lean on!
(somebody to lean on)
(I just might)
I just might have a problem
That you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on!

Lean on me
If (if) there is a load
(there is a load)
You have to bear (you have to bear)
That you can't carry
I'm (I'm right up the road) right up the road
I'll share your load
If you just call me

Call me (I'm calling)
Call me (when you need a friend)
Call me (call me)
Call me (call me)
(when you need a friend)
Call me (when you need a friend)
Call me (if you need a friend)
Call me (any time of day)
Call me

It won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on, lean on, lean on

Lean on, lean on, lean on me, when you need a friend
Lean on, lean on, lean on me, lean on me
Lean on, lean on, lean on me
You can lean on me
I'm gonna need (somebody) somebody to lean on
I'm gonna need somebody to lean on
(somebody to lean on)
