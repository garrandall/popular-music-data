Got a girl, her name's Francine
Finest thing you ever seen
And I love her, she's all that I want
And I need her, she's all that I need
Well, Francine, oh Francis, why
Do you love me and make me cry?
How I love her, she's all that I want
How I need her, she's all that I need
If I ever caught her with Stevie P
I'd throw her back in the Penitentiary, now
And if I caught her with my mother's son
I'll call her daddy and get my gun
My Francine just turned thirteen
She's my angelic teenage queen
And I love her, she's all that I want
And I need her, she's all that I need
And I love her, she's all that I want
And I need her, she's all that I need
And I love her, she's all that I want
And I need her, she's all that I need
