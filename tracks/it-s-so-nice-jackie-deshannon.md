It's so nice coming home to you
My heart belongs
Right at home with you

The road is a road
And it always is the same
It goes on and on
And never seems to change

Life on the road
Is the people we meet
And each one is like
A different street

There's so much to see
And so many things to be
But whatever you do
Don't forget about me

Come on

It's so nice coming home to you
Baby, my heart belongs
Right at home with you

One more time

It's so nice coming home to you
My heart belongs
Right at home with you

Lonely hours when I'm gone
All I want is to get back home
So look out your window
It won't be long
And let everybody know I'm coming home

It's so nice coming home to you
My heart belongs
Right at home with you

Everybody sing now

(It's so nice) It's so nice (coming home) coming home (to you) to you
My heart belongs
Right at home with you

It's so nice coming home to you
My heart belongs
Right at home with you
