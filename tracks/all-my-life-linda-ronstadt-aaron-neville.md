Am I really here in your arms?
This is just like I dreamed it would be
I feel like we're frozen in time
And you're the only one I can see

Hey, I've looked all my life for you
Now you're here
Hey, I've spent all my life with you
All my life

And I never really knew how to love
I just hoped somehow I'd see
Oh I ask for a little help from above
Send that angel down to me

Hey, I've looked all my life for you
Now you're here
Hey, I've spent all my life with you
All my life

I never thought that I could feel a love so tender
Never thought I could let those feelings show
But now my heart is on my sleeve
And this love will never leave
I know
I know

Hey, I've looked all my life for you
And now you're here now you're here
Hey, I've spent all my life with you
All my life all my life

Hey, I've looked all my life for you
And now you're here now you're here
Hey, I've spent all my life with you
