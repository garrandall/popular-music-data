Set the night to music
Set the night to music

Look at all the stars tonight
Look at all the moonlight
Look at us we're all alone

Oh, and it's just like a dream
Like some romantic fantasy
Darlin' come and hold me close
We could be makin' love
And with the slightest touch

We could set the night to music
We could set the night to music
We could do what we want to do
It'll only take me and you
To set the night to music

Find a rhythm on our own
Melt into it nice and slow
Love ourselves away from here

Your heart beating next to mine
Perfect love in perfect time
Watch the world just disappear
This moment is ours to take
And with the love we make

We could set the night to music
We could set the night to music
We could do what we want to do
It'll only take me and you
To set the night to music

This moment is ours to take
(This moment is ours)
And with the love we make
(And with the love we make)
And with the stars that shine

We could set the night to music
We could set the night to music
We could do what we want to do
It'll only take me and you
To set the night to music, to music

Set the night, set the night to music, to music
(Set the night to music)
Set the night, set the night to music, to music
(Set the night to music)
Set the night, set the night to music, to music
(Set the night to music)

We could be makin', we could be makin' love
(Set the night to music)
Tonight, makin' love, makin' love with the stars above
(Set the night to music)
We could be makin' love, makin' love, yes we could, with the stars above
(Set the night to music)
Makin' love with the stars above
(Set the night to music)
