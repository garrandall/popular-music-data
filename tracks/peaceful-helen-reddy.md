In the morning fun when no one will be drinking any more wine
I'll wake the sun up by givin' him a fresh air full of the wind cup
And I won't be found in the shadows hiding sorrow
And I can wait for fate to bring around to me any part of my tomorrow, tomorrow

'cause it's oh, so peaceful here
There's no one bending over my shoulder
Nobody breathing in my ear
Oh, so peaceful here

In the evening shadows are callin' me and the dew settles in my mind
And I think of friends in the yesterday when my plans were giggled in rhyme
I had a son while on the run and his love brought a tear to my eye
And maybe some day he'll up and say "We had a pretty nice time", oh, oh, oh, my

'cause it's oh, so peaceful here
There's no one bending over my shoulder
Nobody breathing in my ear
Oh, so peaceful here
