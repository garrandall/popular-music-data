Saw my father living in a picture
Squinting in the Michigan sun
Caught forever in his blouse and knickers
Wasn't he the lucky one?
While the fear is growing stronger
The sun is almost gone
So hold me in your naked eye
And shoot me on the run

Oh, won't you please, please
Take another picture
Please, please freeze my features
Oh, won't you please, please
Take another
I don't wanna fade away

I saw a picture hidden in the bedroom
Underneath father's ties
A beautiful woman caught naked forever
Black strip over her eyes
I still remember that picture
The image sits sharp and clear
And I'll never erase that eyeless face
Still smiling all these years

Oh, won't you please, please
Take another picture
Please, please freeze my features
Oh, won't you please, please
Take another
I don't wanna fade away
