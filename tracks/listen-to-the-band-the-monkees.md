Hey, hey, mercy woman plays a song and no one listens,
I need help I'm falling again.

Play the drum a little louder,
Tell me I can live without her
If I only listen to the band.

Listen to the band!

Weren't they good, they made me happy.
I think I can make it alone.

Oh, mercy woman plays a song and no one listens,
I need help I'm falling again.

Play the drum a little bit louder,
Tell them they can live without her
If they only listen to the band.

Listen to the band!

Now weren't they good, they made me happy.
I think I can make it alone.

Oh, woman plays a song and no one listens,
I need help I'm falling again.

C'mon, play the drums just a little bit louder,
Tell us we can live without her
Now that we have listened to the band.

Listen to the band!
