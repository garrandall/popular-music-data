Got a letter just this morning, it was postmarked Omaha
It was typed and neatly written, offering me this better job
Better job and higher wages, expenses paid and a car
But I'm on TV here locally, and I can't quit, I'm a star
I come on the TV grinning, wearing pistols and a hat
It's a kiddy show and I'm a hero of the younger set
I'm the number one attraction in every supermarket parking lot
I'm the queen of Kansas City, no thanks Omaha, thanks a lot

Kansas City Star, that's what I are
Yodelee-da-lady, you ought to see my car
I got a big old Cadillac with wired wheels
I got rhinestones on my spokes
I've got credit down at the grocery and my barber tells me jokes
I'm the number one attraction in every supermarket parking lot
I'm the queen of Kansas City, no thanks Omaha, thanks a lot

Kansas City Star, that's what I are
Ha-delee-da-lady, you ought to see my car
I drive a big old Cadillac with wired wheels
I got rhinestones on the spokes
I've got credit down at my grocery store
And my barber tells me jokes
I'm the number one attraction in every supermarket parking lot
I'm the queen of Kansas City, no thanks Omaha, thanks a lot
I'm the queen of Kansas City, no thanks Omaha, thanks a lot
I'm the queen of Kansas City, no thanks Omaha, thanks for nothing
