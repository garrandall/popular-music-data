Contact
Is all it takes
To change your life
To lose your place in time

Contact!
Asleep or awake
Coming around
You may wake up to find

Questions deep within your eyes
Now more than ever you realize

And then you sense a change
Nothing feels the same
All your dreams are strange
Love comes walkin' in

Some kind of alien
Reach for the opening
Then simply pulls a string

Another world
Some other time
You lay your sanity
On the line

Familiar faces
Familiar sights
Reach back
Remember with all your might

Ooh there she stands in a silken gown
Silver lights shining down

And then you sense a change
Nothing feels the same
All your dreams are strange
Love comes walkin' in

Some kind of alien
Reach for the opening
Then simply pulls a string
Love comes walkin' in

Sleep and dream that's all I crave
I travel far across the Milky Way
To my master I become a slave
'Til we meet again some other day

Where silence speaks as loud as war
Earth returns to what it was before

And then you sense a change
Nothing feels the same
All your dreams are strange
Love comes walkin' in

Some kind of alien
Reach for the opening
Then simply pulls a string
Love comes walkin' in

Love comes walkin' in
Baby, pull the string
Love comes walkin' in
Love comes walkin' in
