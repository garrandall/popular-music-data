Yeah

Dancing, dancing, dancing
She's a dancing machine
Ah baby
Move it, baby

Yeah
Automatic Systematic
Full of color self contained
Tuned and gentle to your vibes
Captivating stimulating
She's such a sexy lady
Filled with space age design

Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing
Yeah

Rythymatic acrobatic
She's a dynamite attraction
At the drop of a coin she comes alive, yeah
She knows what she's doing
She's super bad now
She's geared to really blow your mind, yeah

Dancing, dancing, dancing
She's a dancing machine
Ah baby
Do it, baby

She's a dance, dance, dance, dance, dancing machine
Watch her get down, watch her get down
As she do, do, do her thing
Right on the scene

She's a dance, dance, dance, dance, dancing machine
Watch her get down, watch her get down
As she do, do, do her thing
Right on the scene

I just can't, I just can't
I just can't control my feet
I just can't, I just can't
I just can't control my feet
I just can't, I just can't
I just can't control my feet
I just can't, I just can't
I just can't control my feet
Yeah

Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing

She's a dance, dance, dance, dance, dancing machine
Watch her get down, watch her get down
As she do, do, do her thing
Right on the scene

She's a dance, dance, dance, dance, dancing machine
Watch her get down, watch her get down
As she do, do, do her thing
Right on the scene

Yeah

Rhythmatic acrobatic
Dancing, dancing
