Two broken hearts lonely looking like houses
Where nobody lives
Two people each having so much pride inside
Neither side, forgives
The angry words spoken in haste
Such a waste of two lives
It's my belief pride is the chief cause in the decline
In the number of husbands and wives
A woman and a man
A man and a woman
Some can and some can't and some can

Two broken hearts lonely looking like houses
Where nobody lives
Two people each having so much pride inside
That neither side, forgives
The angry words spoken in haste
Such a waste of two lives
It's my belief pride is the chief cause in the decline
In the number of husbands and wives
Husbands and wives
