Nevermind the reason, you may never know
Blame it on the seasons, they come and go
Blame it on the weather, something in the wind
Blame it on whatever, it might have been

You can say you know what happened
You can say that I was wrong
You can say most anything you want to
You can say... I just say so long, so long, so long

Say it doesn't matter, say it's all for fun
Nevermind the laughter, that doesn't come
Tell yourself you hate me, tell us all your side
Tell your friends I'm crazy, it'll save your pride

You can say you know what happened
You can say that I was wrong
You can say most anything you want to
You can say... I just say so long, so long, so long

So long, so long, so long... I just say so long

Call it fact or fiction, blame it all on me
Speak of your conviction in destiny
Say it's not important, you can swear it's all a game
Call it fame or fortune, but it's all the same

You can say you know what happened
You can say that I was wrong
You can say most anything you want to
You can say... I just say so long, so long
I just say so long

(You can say you know what happened)
You can say that I was wrong
You can say most anything you want to

You can say, you can say, you can say...
I just say so long
(You can say you know what happened)
I just say so long
(You can say you know what happened)
I been wrong before
(You can say you know what happened)
Does it really matter, oh
You can say you know what happened
