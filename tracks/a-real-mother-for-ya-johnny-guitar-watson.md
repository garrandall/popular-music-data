Wanna buy a new car
But the price ain't right
Be a downside cheaper
Start riding a bike
They're making milk out of powder
Got the baby's crying
Rent gone up higher
Got the parents lying
"I'll pay you tomorrow"


Lord, its a real mother for ya
Make you wanna run for cover
And if you look you will discover
Lord, its a real mother for ya


Listen
Got to go to a disco
Throw your troubles away
Dance to the music
That the DJ's play
And then the lights come on
Like you knew they would
Go home and face the music
That don't sound too good

Lord, its a real mother for ya
Make you wanna run for cover
And if you look you will discover
Lord, its a real mother for ya
Say, it's a real mother for ya yeah


Too cold
Gimme 3 gallons of low lead
4 if you will
And two hot dogs and a strawberry shake
Lord, its a real mother for ya
Lord, its a real mother for ya
Lord, its a real mother for ya
