As I walk along I wonder what went wrong
With our love, a love that was so strong
And as still walk on I think of the things we've done
Together while our hearts were young

I'm a walking in the rain, tears are falling and I feel a pain
Wishing you were here by me to end this misery
And I wonder, I wo wo wo wo wonder
Why, why why why why why she (you) ran away
And I wonder where she (you) will stay
My little runaway, a run run run run runaway
