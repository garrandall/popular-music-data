Ridin' restless under broken sky
Weary traveller, somethin' missin' inside
Always lookin' for a reason to turn around
Desperate for a little peace of mind
Just a little piece of what I left behind
Well, I found it now, you're like coming home


You're like a Sunday mornin', pleasin' my eyes
You're a midsummer's dream under a star-soaked sky
That peaceful easy feelin' at the end of a long, long road
You're like coming home
You're like coming home, all right


Go head and let your hair fall down
This wanderlust: it's gone now
I'm here in your arms, I'm safe from the road again
These are the days that can't be erased
Baby, there isn't a better place
You're like heaven, you're like coming home


You're like a Sunday mornin', pleasin' my eyes
You're a midsummer's dream under a star-soaked sky
That peaceful easy feelin' at the end of a long, long road
You're like coming home


You're that innocence, that serenity
That long-lost part of me


You're like a Sunday mornin', pleasin' my eyes
A midsummer's dream under a star-soaked sky
That peaceful easy feelin' at the end of a long, long road

You're like a Sunday mornin', pleasin' my eyes
You're a midsummer's dream under a star-soaked sky
That peaceful easy feelin' at the end of a long, long road
You're like coming home, yeah
You're like coming home
Baby, like coming home
You're like coming home
