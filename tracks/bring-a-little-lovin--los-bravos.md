I know that it's ten and you're stayin' in
La la la la la la la la la
And you're stayin' home and I'm all alone
La la la la la la la la la

Won't you, won't you, won't you
Bring a little water, bring a little wine
Bring a little lovin', and I feel fine
I know that you want to, and I know that you do
Come in here and love with me

It's thunder and rains, but it's all the same
La la la la la la la la la
I'm paying for this call, and I don't mind at all
La la la la la la la la la

Won't you, won't you, won't you
Bring a little water, bring a little wine
Bring a little lovin', and I feel fine
I know that you want to, and I know that you do
Come in here and love with me

Won't you, won't you, won't you
Won't you, won't you, won't you
Bring a little water, bring a little wine
Bring a little lovin', and I feel fine
I know that you want to, and I know that you do
Come in here and love with me

Won't you, won't you, won't you
Bring a little water, bring a little wine
Bring a little lovin', and I feel fine
Bring a little water, bring a little wine
Bring a little lovin', and I feel fine

Won't you, won't you, won't you
Bring a little water, bring a little wine
Bring a little lovin', and I feel fine
