You say you love me, but I think you're wrong
We've had times in the past when we weren't so strong
Well, I don't know which way to turn
And I don't know which way to turn
The times have changed, I can read your face
There's been so many lies and no tears with your cries
Well I don't know which way to turn
And I don't know which way to turn

I've been ashamed for so many years
I don't know how to cope when you bring out the tears
And I don't know which way to turn
'Cause I don't know which end to burn

I love you more than a man could say
We've been through a lot
Gone our sep'rate ways
'Cause I don't know which way to turn
And I don't know which way to turn

I said I love you, well, I do
I don't know whether I'm wrong or whether I'm right
Or which way to turn
And I don't know which way to turn
