You may be an ambassador to England or France
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls


But you're gotta serve somebody, yes
You're gotta serve somebody
It may be the devil, it may be the Lord
Come on and serve somebody

You may be a state trooper, you might be a young Turk
You may be the head of some big TV network
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame
You may be living in another country under another name



You may be a construction worker working on a home
You may be living in a mansion or you might live in a dome
You might own guns and you might even own tanks
You might be somebody's landlord, you might even have banks



You may be a preacher with your spiritual pride
You may be a city councilman taking bribes on the side
You may be workin' in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair
You may be somebody's mistress, you may be somebody's heir



You may call me Sally, you may call me Jane
You may call me Sheila, and you may call me Irene
You may call me Molly, but my name is Shirley
What God gave you
