Here comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion
I want to walk in the open wind
I want to talk like lovers do
Want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you?


So baby talk to me
Like lovers do
Walk with me
Like lovers do
Talk to me
Like lovers do


Here comes the rain again
Raining in my head like a tragedy
Tearing me apart like a new emotion
Oooooh
I want to breathe in the open wind
I want to kiss like lovers do
Want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you?


So baby talk to me
Like lovers do
Walk with me
Like lovers do
Talk to me
Oooooh
Like lovers do

So baby talk to me
Like lovers do

Oooooh
Oooooh yeah
Here it comes again
Oooooh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey


Here comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion
(Here it comes again, here it comes again)
I want to walk in the open wind
I want to talk like lovers do
Want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you?


Oooooh
Here comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion
I want to walk in the open wind
I want to talk like lovers do
Want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you?
