Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Listen, babe


Every time I see you, I get a bad vibe
Just thinkin' of someone else in between your thighs
And you thought you were slick, had tricks up your sleeve
But I'm sick of your stupid ass and I know you're tired of me
That's why I say


And when we were together
We never turned our backs on each other
But now that we're separated
We can't stand one another


I don't wanna be with you - put that on everything I own
I can't believe I stayed around that damn long
If I never see you again, I won't be mad at all, no no
'Cause I believe that you're my downfall
You did me wrong


When were together you did me wrong
I thought you were true
You ran out of my life
And now I'm so through with you

I wanted you to be there
Right here with me, oh



It's really over babe
'Cause you did me wrong



I remember when you used to sit there
I would hold you in my arms and you would say to me
Yeah, yeah


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mmm, mmm, mmm
(I used to rub your body and you would say to me)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mmm, mmm, mmm
(When we were together you'd say)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mmm, mmm, mmm
(I can hear your body say)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Sounds so good to me)
Mmm, mmm, mmm
