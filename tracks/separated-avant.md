Mummmm ummm (on and on)


I don't care what my momma says
I don't care what my daddy says
I don't care bout' what the preacher said for us to do I don't care about it


I dont care what you brother saw
I don't care it was all your fault
How could you do what you did to me you wait till' I was sleepin' call the damn
police


Separate, what we got to do
Separate, talkin' bout' me and you
Separate, how it's got to be
Separate, no more you and me
Separate, what we got to do
Separate, talkin' bout' me and you
Separate, how it's got to be
Separate, no more me and you
(1st time only)
(Watchin' me)


I don't know what you callin' for
So don't you come tryin' to kick down my door
Everything is mine to keep
Money
Car
Crib
My kid everything


Everything but my boy you can have
And I don't care as long as you don't cross my path
and now I know you never cared at all
For 2 years you've been my down fall




Listen' girl
Never did explain when I saw you with your friend


But what about the movies when you said it was your friend


Listen' in the bathroom talkin' low on the phone


Well what do you expect when you aint ever at home

(Avant)
You see I'm workin' all day and hustlin' all night


I'm cookin'  and I'm cleanin' and all you want to do is fight


Why me?


Why me?


I think it's bout' time that we both move on


Be gone
