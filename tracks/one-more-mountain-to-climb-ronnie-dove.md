You open your arms when you see me
You cry when I walk away
But though you tell me you need me
There's still one word you won't say

I've got one more mountain to climb
One more river to cross
Say you love me this time
I've got one more mountain to climb

I know that somebody hurt you
He broke each promise he made
But I'd rather die than desert you
So love me and don't be afraid

I've got one more mountain to climb
One more river to cross
Say you love me this time
I've got one more mountain to climb

You need me, I know it
You do little things to show it
I keep getting closer to you
So why can't you say you love me too?

One more mountain to climb
One more river to cross
Say you love me this time
I've got one more mountain to climb
