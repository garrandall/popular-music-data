With Count Basie
Your precious love
Means more to me
Than any love could ever be
For when I wanted you, baby
I was lonely, I was so blue, baby
For that's what love, love will do
And, darling, I was so surprised
That you know, I failed to realize
That you, you were just
Fooling poor me
And, darling, they say
That our love will not grow
But I look on out, I tell them
Huh, you just don't know
For as long as
You're in love with me
Our love will grow wider
Deeper than any sea
And of all the things
Jackie want out of
This whole wide world
Is for you to tell me
Tell me you'll be my girl
Ooh, wanting you
I'm so lonely, baby
For your, your precious love
Baby, I been lonesome
And you know I need
Somebody like you, mama
Just love me...
