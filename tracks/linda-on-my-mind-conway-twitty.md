Now I'm lying here with Linda on my mind
And next to me my soon to be the one I left behind
And Lord it's killing me to see her cryin'
She know I'm lying here beside her with Linda on my mind
Yes I know that I once loved her and I place no one above her
And I never thought I'd ever set her free
But it just wasn't in my plans the way Linda squeezed my hand
The first time that I held her close as she danced with me
She said I've loved you for such a long time but you're married to a friend of mine
And I try hard to never let it show
But my love for you is stronger and I can't hide it any longer
And so I thought I'd better let you know
Now I'm lying here with Linda on my mind...
