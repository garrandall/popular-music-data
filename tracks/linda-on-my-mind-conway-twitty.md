Now I'm lying here with Linda on my mind
And next to me, my soon-to-be, the one I left behind
And Lord it's killing me to see her cry
She knows I'm lying here beside her with Linda on my mind


Yes I know that I once loved her
And I placed no one above her
And I never thought I'd ever set her free
But it just wasn't in my plans
The way that Linda squeezed my hand
The first time that I held her close
As she danced with me


She said, "I've loved you for a long time
But you're married to a friend of mine
And I've tried hard to never let it show
But my love for you is stronger
I can't hide it any longer"
And so I thought I'd better let you know


Now I'm lying here with Linda on my mind
And next to me, my soon-to-be, the one I left behind
And Lord it's killing me to see her cry
She knows I'm lying here beside her with Linda on my mind
