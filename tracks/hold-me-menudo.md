Everytime I see you
You look so good
You've got that magic, oh
Llike a girl should

I just wanna tell you exactly how I feel
I want you to know, girl
That my love for you is for real, oh yeah

I will never turn my back on you now
It doesn't matter, baby what you do, oh, girl
Oh, girl, I'll never let you down
I'll always be around

Just as long as you
Hold me and you tell me
All the sweet things that I need to hear
It's been so long
Since I felt as strong as I feel for you

I just want you to hold me
Let me show you
How love can make our dreams come true
Let me hold you and I'll give you
All that you'll ever need, please just believe me

Whenever I call you
You're never at home
My friends keep saying that I'm in love alone
When they start talking
I turn the other way
Girl, I want you to know that I need you so
I don't care what other people say

As long as you hold me
And you tell me
All the sweet things that I need to hear
It's been so long since I felt as strong
As I feel for you

I just want you to hold me, let me show you
How love can make our dreams come true
Let me hold you and I'll give you
All that you'll ever need, please just believe me

I will never turn my back on you now
It doesn't matter, baby what you do, oh, girl
Oh, girl, I'll never let you down
I'll always be around

I just want you to
Hold me and you tell me
All the sweet things that I need to hear
It's been so long since I felt as strong
As I feel for you

I just want you to hold me
Let me show you
How love can make our dreams come true
Let me hold you and I'll give you
All that you'll ever need

I want you to
Hold me and tell me
All the sweet things that I need to hear
It's been so long since I felt as strong
