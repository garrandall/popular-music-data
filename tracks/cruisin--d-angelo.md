Baby, let's cruise away from here
Don't be confused, baby, the way is clear
And if you want it, you got it forever
Oh, this is not a one night stand baby


Ohoh let the music take your mind
And just release and you will find, baby


We're going to fly away
Glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music was made for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together


Baby, tonight belongs to us
Everything's right, do what you must baby
And inch by inch we get closer and closer
Every little part of each other, oh baby, baby


Let the music take your mind
And just release and you will find, baby


We're going to fly away
Glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music was made for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together
We're going to fly away
Glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music was made for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together


Cruise with me, baby, baby
Oh baby
Oh baby, let's cruise, let's flow
Let's glide, let's open up and go inside
And if you want it you got it forever
I can just stay there inside you and love you, baby


Let the music take your mind
And just release and you will find, baby


We're going to fly away
Glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music was made for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together
We're going to fly away
Glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music was made for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together
