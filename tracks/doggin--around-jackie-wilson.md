You better stop, yeah, doggin' me around
If don't you stop, yeah, I'm gonna put you down

Cause, I can't take it
Much longer
My heart's getting weak,
It's not getting any stronger
You keep me so upset,
My head's in a whirl,
But if you wanna be my girl

You better stop, yeah, doggin' me around
Cause if you don't stop, I'm gonna put you down

Now you know you go out nights,
To have yourself a ball
Sometimes you don't, you don't make it home at all
I don't mind you having yourself a real good time,
But now what are you tryna do, tryna make me loose my mind

You better stop, yeah, doggin' me around
If you don't stop, I'm gonna put you down
Yes, put you down
I don't want to do it, but I'll have to put you down
I love you baby, but still, I'll put you down...
