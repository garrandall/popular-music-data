Alright, cool
Got it on smash
(Yeah) Yeah


Talk to me, baby (Talk)
You's a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby (Yeah)
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor
I want you to talk to me, baby (Talk)
You's a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby (Yeah)
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor, oh


Talk to me, baby (Talk)
Work it, take the shift off for me, baby (Alright)
I drive the whip you bought for me, baby (Brr)
You know I got a lotta opps on me, baby
I whip around the corner in the whip (Whip)
Shout out Rafaello, man I love the drip, drip (Drip, drip)
80 pointers on my wrist (Ooh)
I'm hella rich and I love to talk shit, so


Talk to me, baby (Talk)
You's a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby (Yeah)
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor
I want you to talk to me, baby (Talk)
You's a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby (Yeah)
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor, oh


Let her go, go, go, go (Yeah)
Go, go, go, go (What?)
Girl, I'll race you to the floor, tell her go
Tell the crew, I got money, I'm the one you wanna know


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I can make that pussy talk back (What?)
I can spoil you wit' these big racks (Racks)
She got good head (Head) and she eat her cornbread (Cornbread)
The Wraith red, Ben Frank, my friends dead (Yeah)
I don't wanna miss it, all of the money, I don't wanna kiss you
The pussy official, I fuck her one time and her face in a pillow
It's a one night ting, my diamonds fighting
This not no Breitling, that pussy biting
I tell her to talk to me (Talk to me)
The plug gon' walk with me (Plug)
Ooh, she bougie, she busy (Busy)
Fuck it, might buy her a Bentley (Bentley, fuck it)
Go (Go), go to the floor and pick up (And pick up)
She callin' my phone, might pick up (Brr)
She too bad, I might miss her (Rich)


Talk to me, baby (Talk)
You's a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby (Yeah)
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor
I want you to talk to me, baby (Talk)
You's a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby (Yeah)
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor, oh


Let her go, go, go, go (Yeah)
Go, go, go, go
Girl, I'll race you to the floor, tell her go
Tell the crew, I got money, I'm the one you wanna know
