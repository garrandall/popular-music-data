Sometimes you love me like a good woman oughta
Sometimes you hurt me so bad, my tears run like water
Sometimes you get me out, yeah, right before your friends now
Then you kiss on me baby, tell me you love me again, yeah
Your love is like seesaw
Your love is like seesaw, yeah
Your love is like seesaw, baby
Go up, down, all around like a see saw
Sometimes you tell me I'm your sweet candy man
Then sometimes, baby, I just never know where I stand
You lift me up when I'm on the ground
Soon as I get up, child, you send me tumbling down
Oh, your love is like seesaw
Your love is like seesaw, yeah
Your love is like seesaw, baby
Go up, down, all around like a seesaw, yeah
When I'm, kissing you and I like it
And ask you to kiss me again
I reach at you, you jump out of sight
You change just like the wind
Got it right, got it right, got it right now
Your love is like seesaw, yeah
Your love is like seesaw
Your love is like seesaw, baby
Go up, down, go up, down
Go up, down all around like a seesaw
Never know baby, 
Sometimes you love me, sometimes you 
Baby I don't need no talking of love
I want someone to love me all the time, right now
Sometimes you love me, you love me 
Up and down all around, I never know when you're with me baby
Never know when you're kissing me
 love you, I need to love
