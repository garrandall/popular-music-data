I'm on my way
To freedom land
I'm on my way
To freedom land
I'm on my way
To freedom land
I'm on my way
Great god I'm on my way

I asked you my brother
To come with me
I asked my brother
To come with me
I asked my brother
To come with me
I'm on my way
Great god I'm on my way

I asked my sister
To come with me
I asked my sister
To come with me
I asked my sister
To come along with me
I'm on my way
Great god I'm on my way

I'm on my way
To freedom land
I'm on my way
To freedom land
I'm on my way
To freedom land
I'm on my way
Great god I'm on my way
