I'm gonna live, laugh, love just for today
Gonna take all the trouble that tomorrow might bring and put it away
Gonna drink every drop of happiness till they cover me up
I'm gonna live, gonna laugh, gonna love

I got a buddy that wakes up worryin' about stocks and bonds
He's up and he's down and he only smiles when the market's strong
I spend my whole week's wages at the dance on Saturday night
I won't never grow a portfolio but, hey, that's alright

I'm gonna live, laugh, love just for today
Gonna take all the trouble that tomorrow might bring and put it away
Gonna drink every drop of happiness till they cover me up
I'm gonna live, gonna laugh, gonna love

I got a cabin in the country and the tin roof rattles
When the rain comes down
Where the wind through the pine helps me unwind
While the world goes 'round
I got a woman that fills my heart so full that it overflows
And how it gets any better than this, brother, I don't know

I'm gonna live, laugh, love just for today
Gonna take all the trouble that tomorrow might bring and put it away
Gonna drink every drop of happiness till they cover me up
I'm gonna live, gonna laugh, gonna love

I'm gonna live, laugh, love just for today
Gonna take all the trouble and put it away
Gonna drink every drop of happiness till they cover me up
I'm gonna live, gonna laugh, gonna love

I'm gonna live, laugh, love just for today
Gonna take all the trouble that tomorrow might bring and put it away
I'm gonna drink every drop of happiness till they cover me up
I'm gonna live, gonna laugh, gonna love
I'm gonna live, gonna laugh, gonna love
