May I explain right from the start,
You've always been queen of my heart,
Ooh wee ooh wee,
Queen of my heart.

No matter what I've said or done,
To me you'll be my only one,
Ooh wee, ooh wee
Queen of my heart

Here is my heart
To do with as you please,
Here is the key,
Open and you'll see,
You'll find a love, a love all your own,
Realize your treasure, realize your throne.

No matter what I've said or done,
To me you'll be my only one
Ooh wee, ooh wee,
Queen of my heart, queen of my heart...
