Ah, Ah
No! No! No!
Ah, Ah
No! No! No!
Ah, Ah
No! No! No!
No! No! No!
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah (fade)

I don't need your - No! No! No!
I don't need your - No! No! No!
I don't need your love no more
I don't need your - No! No! No!
I don't need your - No! No! No!
I don't need your love no more

Thinking about the times we spent together
You said you'd never leave
But then you left me lonely
And now you're here boy
And you are my love
No second chances
Boy your time is up
Cuz now I'm stronger
And I'm standing on my own
So...

I don't need your - No! No! No!
I don't need your - No! No! No!
I don't need your love no more
I don't need your - No! No! No!
I don't need your - No! No! No!
I don't need your love no more

Do you remember
How you used to say you loved me?
You promised me the world
And placed no one above me
I've learned my lesson
And I've learned it well
Now I know better
There's nothing left to say
The doors are closed now
I don't want you back no more!
Nooo!

I don't need your - No! No! No!
I don't need your - No! No! No!

I don't need your love no more
I don't need your - No! No! No!
I don't need your - No! No! No!
I don't need your love no more

I don't need your - No! No! No!
I don't need your - No! No! No!
I don't need your love no more
I don't need your - No! No! No!
I don't need your - No! No! No!
I don't need your love no more

I don't need-
I don't need-
No more!
I don't need-
I don't need-
No more!

Recordando
El amor que me has dado
Prometias que siempre estaria a tu lado
Pero me dejaste
Sin qualquiere razon
Y me quebraste
El corazon
He aprendido
Y no quiero tu amor!
Ya no quiero mas!

I don't need your - No! No! No!
I don't need your - No! No! No!
I don't need your love no more
I don't need your - No! No! No!
I don't need your - No! No! No!
I don't need your love no more

I don't need your - No! No! No!
I don't need your - No! No! No!
I don't need your love no more
I don't need your - No! No! No!
I don't need your - No! No! No!
I don't need your love no more
