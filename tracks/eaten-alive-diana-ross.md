Animal stalking you at night
I'm a sucker for someone
And I got the prey in sight
Lying on a bed of leaves
In the modern times
You forget and let your spirit breathe

Capture me my blood is red
Another victim of your ritual
For you my skin is shed
Ecstacy ain't what you find
In the modern world
One flick of my tongue changes
The meaning of the world
And you say

That's impossible
That's not impossible to do, oh
And you digest what I can see
The taste of you can be

I don't wanna get eaten alive
'Cause you're so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust, you see
I don't wanna get eaten alive
To be eaten alive
Eaten alive
I don't ever wanna be
Eaten alive

Now I got you on the run
And the quicker my senses
And the chance is, I'm the faster one
I know the universal law
Primeval times
With a little stimulation
It'll come once more, and you say

That's impossible
It's not impossible to do, oh
And you digest what I can see
The taste of you can be

I don't wanna get eaten alive
'Cause you're so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust
You see
I don't wanna get eaten alive
To be eaten alive
Eaten alive
I don't ever wanna be
Eaten alive

I don't wanna get eaten alive
'Cause you're so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust
You see
I don't wanna get eaten alive
To be eaten alive
Tie me to a tree, crawl all over me
You can rip my shirt, drag me in the dirt
I will be your slave, anything you say
I don't ever wanna be eaten alive

I don't wanna get eaten alive
'Cos you're so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust, you see
I don't wanna get eaten alive
'Cos you're so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust, you see
I don't wanna get eaten alive
'Cos you're dangerous
No more hearts I can trust, you see
I don't wanna get eaten alive
To be eaten alive

Gotta do her, crawl all over me
You can rip my shirt, drag me in the dirt
I will be your slave, anything you say
I don't ever wanna be, eaten alive
