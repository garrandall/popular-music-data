Here we go
Ready or not
Watch us now
While we're doing the slop


Everybody up on your feet now
We're gonna do the slop
Yes its really got the beat yeah

Hey, it's here again
Hey hey, now we're number one
But now that its back
Its really, its really catching on
Slop time, all night long

Its not a girl thing
Its just a movement
Before you know
Its gonna be a coast to coast thing

Hey, here again
Hey hey, now we're number one
But now that its back
Its just a natural fact
They even do it to the Monster Mash

New York

Detroit

Boston
They're gonna give it a chance
Philly



Here we go
Ready or not
Watch us now
While we're doing the slop

Stop time, all night long
Chicago
Its the only dance they do
Pittsburgh
They do it like its all they do
St. Louis
Let me tell you its the king
Cleveland
They love it and they really swing


Here we go
Ready or not
Watch us now
While we're doing the slop

Here again
Remember when
But now its back
As a matter of fact
