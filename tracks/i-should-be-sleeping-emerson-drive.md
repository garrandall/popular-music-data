I never knew there were such great movies 
on TV at 3 AM 
I'd never guessed that at midnight Tuesday 
I could have pizza ordered in 
I've never been a real night owl 
But these days I'm all turned around 
There's only one thing I'm sure of right now


I should be sleeping 
'Stead of keeping 
These late hours I've been keeping 
I've been pacing and retracing 
every step of every move 
even though I'm feeling so right 
I'm so happy still I know I 
should be sleeping 
instead of dreaming about you 

I never knew that I was funny 
'til I went and made you laugh 
never liked a girl to call me honey 
but you did and I liked that 
I keep thinking about your smile 
trying to read between the lines 
looks like I'll be up for a while 



After just three dates 
and one great kiss 
it's way too soon 
to be obsessing like this 



Dreaming about you 
I should be sleeping 
dreaming about you 

Well, I'm dreaming about you 
Yeah
