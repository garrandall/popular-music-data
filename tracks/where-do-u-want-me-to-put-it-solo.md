Time to get off
Let's get it on
Anytime you're in the mood to groove
Give me a call
Just say the word, I'll be right there
Baby, I'm gonna fill you up with tender love and care
It's all to make you feel good
To carry you to ecstasy
If you give me directions, communicate to me, baby


Baby, tell me where do you want me to put it
If you want me to get it right
Tell me what should I do with it
‘Cause you’re starting to work it down
And I don't want to lose it
Baby, tell me where do you want me to put it


It's time to come closer
‘Cause we got the urge
So baby, can we do it once or twice just to rehearse
When can we work it out?
When can we work it out?
Or do you like it when I get my groove on
Round and around and around and around

It's all to make you feel good
And love even the blind can see
If you’re giving direction, communicate to me


Baby, tell me where do you want me to put it
If you want me to get it right
Tell me what should I do with it
‘Cause you’re starting to work it down
And I don't want to lose it
Baby, tell me where do you want me to put it


If it feels good to you, say ‘yeah’
Ah yeah, it feels good
(Feels so good to me)
Ah yeah, it feels good
(Oh, it sho’nuff feels real good)
Ah yeah, it feels good
(Sho’nuff feels good to ya, let me hear ya say ‘yeah’)
Ah yeah, it feels good
(Work it on down)

We're getting down
All the way down
We're going down
Where did you want me to put it? (Down)

Is it right here? (Is it over there?)
Is it where you want it? (Baby, I don’t care)
When we're making love, I love to get you warm


Baby, tell me where do you want me to put it
If you want me to get it right
Tell me what should I do with it
‘Cause you’re starting to work it down
And I don't want to lose it
Baby, tell me where do you want me to put it

Tell me where do you want me to put it
If you want me to get it right
Tell me what should I do with it
‘Cause you’re starting to work it down
And I don't want to lose it
Baby, tell me where do you want me to put it

(Where you want me to put it?)
Ah yeah, it feels good
(Baby, tell me where) Ah yeah, it feels good
