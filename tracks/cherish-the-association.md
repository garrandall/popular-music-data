Cherish is the word I use to describe
All the feeling that I have
Hiding here for you inside
You don't know how many times
I've wished that I had told you
You don't know how many times
I've wished that I could hold you
You don't know how many times
I've wished that I could
Mold you into someone who could
Cherish me as much as I cherish you

Perish is the word that more than applies
To the hope in my heart each time I realize
That I am not gonna be the one
To share your dreams
That I am not gonna be the one
To share your schemes
That I am not gonna be the one to share what
Seems to be the life that you could
Cherish as much as I do yours

Oh, I'm beginning to think that man has never found
The words that could make you want me
That have the right amount of letters
Just the right sound
That could make you hear, make you see
That you are drivin' me out of my mind

Oh, I could say I need you
But then you'd realize
That I want you
Just like a thousand other guys
Who'd say they loved you
Like all the rest of their lies
When all they wanted
Was to touch your face your hands
And gaze into your eyes

Cherish is the word I use to describe
All the feeling
That I have hiding here for you inside
You don't know how many times
I've wished that I had told you
You don't know how many times
I've wished that I could hold you
You don't know how many times
I've wished that I could
Mold you into someone who could
Cherish me as much as I cherish you

And I do
Cherish you
And I do
Cherish you

Cherish is the word
