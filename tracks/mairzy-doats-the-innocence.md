Mairzy doats and dozy doats
And little lambsy dyvy,
A kiddle-dee-dyvy too,
Wouldn't you?

(Repeat)

Now if the words sound queer
And funny to your ear,
A little bit jumbled and jivy,
Sing mairzy doats, and dozy doats,
And little lambsy dyvy.

Oh mairzy doats and dozy doats
And little lambsy dyvy,
A kiddle-dee-dyvy too,
Wouldn't you?
Mairzy doats and dozy doats
And little lambsy dyvy,
A kiddle-dee dyvy too, a kiddle-dee dyvy too,
A kiddle-dee-dyvy too... wouldn't you?
