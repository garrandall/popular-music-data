Can anybody find me somebody to love?

Each morning I get up, I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord whatcha doin' to me?
I've spent all my years of believin' you
But I just can't get no relief
Lord, somebody (somebody), somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losin' my beat
I'm okay I'm alright
Ain't gonna face no defeat
I just gotta get outta this prison cell
One day I'm gonna be free
Lord, somebody (somebody), somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

Every day
I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm goin' crazy
They say I gotta lot of water in my brain
Got no common sense, I got nobody there to believe
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

(Ooh ooh, ooh ah
Find her somebody to love
Find her somebody to love
Find her somebody to love
Find her somebody to love
Find her somebody to love
Find her somebody to love)

Can anybody find me somebody to love?

(Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love)
