I was listening to the radio
I heard a song
Reminded me of long ago
Back then I thought that things
Were never gonna change
It used to be that I never
Had to feel the pain
I know now that
Things will never be the same

I wanna go back (go back)
And do it all over
Can't go back, I know
I wanna go back (go back)
'Cause I'm feeling so much older
But I can't go back, I know

I recall hanging out on Friday night
My first slow dance
Hoping that I'll get it right
Back then, I thought
I would never, ever stand alone
It used to be that a lonely heart was never shown
I know now that
Things will never be the same

I wanna go back (go back)
And do it all over
Can't go back, I know
I wanna go back (go back)
'Cause I'm feeling so much older
But I can't go back, I know
Ooh, yeah

I know now that
Things will never be the same

I wanna go back (go back)
And do it all over
Can't go back, I know
I wanna go back (go back)
'Cause I'm feeling so much older
But I can't go back, I know

I wanna go back
(Go back) do it all over
Can't go back, I know
I wanna go back again
'Cause I'm feeling so much older

I wanna go back (go back)
And do it all over
Can't go back, I know
I wanna go back (again)
'Cause I'm feeling so much older
But I can't go back, I know
