This thing called life
Know what's the meaning of the line
Tell me
Well, it's like dreaming of your goals
Ambitions for feeling free
I'm on this mission to achieve
Achieve what?
What's in your mind's eye
This is what you believe
You should gain
Uh-huh
Satisfaction becomes a shining example
A test is a sample of a new race
That has ample supply of positivity
You mean flow?
Well, like an electricity
So, you see a clear way with no ambiguity
Don't you know

What's the meaning
What's the meaning of life
What's the meaning
What's the meaning of life

Elevate your mind, free your soul
Well, come on, come on
Feel the feeling, let your body take control
Aw, yeah
Elevate your mind, free your soul
Well, come on, come on
Feel the feeling, let your body take control

Well, don't be afraid to experiment, you know, hm
Go ahead, you know and implement your ideas
Your notions, put them in motion
Like the words the funky dreads have spoken to you
So listen up loud and clear
This is a word you must be aware of
What ya gonna do? Put it in your life tool
And that's the meaning of the line

What's the meaning
What's the meaning of life
What's the meaning
What's the meaning of life
What's the meaning
What's the meaning of life
What's the meaning
What's the meaning of life
And it goes

Elevate your mind, free your soul
Well, come on, come on
Feel the feeling, let your body take control
Aw, yeah
Elevate your mind and free your soul
Well, come on, come on
Feel the feeling, let your body take control

So there it is; work it out for yourself
Yeah, be selective, be ojective
Be an asset to the collective
As you know you got to get a life

What's the meaning
What's the meaning of life
What's the meaning
What's the meaning of life
What's the meaning
What's the meaning of life
What's the meaning
What's the meaning of life

Elevate your mind, free your soul
Well, come on, come on
Feel the feeling, let your body take control
Aw, yeah
Elevate your mind, free your soul
Well, come on, come on
Feel the feeling, let your body take control
