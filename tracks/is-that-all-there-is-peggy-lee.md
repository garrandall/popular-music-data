I remember when I was a little girl, our house caught on fire.
I'll never forget the look on my father's face as he gathered me up
In his arms and raced through the
Burning building out to the pavement.
And I stood there shivering in my pajamas
And watched the whole world go up in flames.
And when it was all over I said to
Myself, "Is that all there is to a fire"

Is that all there is, is that all there is
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is

And when I was 12 years old,
My daddy took me to the circus, the greatest show on earth.
There were clowns and elephants and dancing bears.
And a beautiful lady in pink tights flew high above our heads.
And so I sat there watching
I had the feeling that something was missing.
I don't know what, but when it was over,
I said to myself, "is that all there is to the circus?
Is that all there is, is that all there is
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is

And then I fell in love
With the most wonderful boy in the world.
We would take long walks by the river or
Just sit for hours gazing into each other's eyes.
We were so very much in love.
Then one day he went away and I thought I'd die, but I didn't,
And when I didn't I said to myself, "Is that all there is to love?"

Is that all there is, is that all there is
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing

I know what you must be saying to yourselves,
If that's the way she feels about it why doesn't she just end it all?
Oh, no, not me. I'm not ready for that final disappointment,
Because I know just as well as I'm standing here talking to you,
When that final moment comes and I'm
Breathing my last breath, I'll be saying to myself

Is that all there is, is that all there is
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is
