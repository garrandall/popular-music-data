Sam
You've been waiting much too long now
It looks like she's not coming home

Sam
You've been loyal, true and faithful
All this time with being alone

If I could get that same dedication
I'd give you everything in creation
If she doesn't come back (If she doesn't come back)

I'll be your substitute
Whenever you want me, ohoho
Don't you know I'll be your substitute
Whenever you need me, oho

Sam
Every day you waited for her
I've been waiting here for you

Sam
All this time I've been lonely
I know what you've been going through

I'll wait until my chances occur
'Cause you can't keep relying on her
If she doesn't come back (If she doesn't come back)

I'll be your substitute
Whenever you want me, ohoho
Don't you know I'll be your substitute
Whenever you need me, oho

Each day by your window
You sit and sigh hoping to see her face
Ah, you might as well forget about her
And find someone to take her place (If she doesn't come back)

I'll be your substitute
Whenever you want me, ohoho
Don't you know I'll be your substitute
Whenever you want me, oho

Don't you know I'll be your substitute
Whenever you want me, ohoho
Don't you know I'll be your substitute
Whenever you want me, oho

Don't you know I'll be your substitute
Whenever you want me, ohoho
Don't you know I'll be your substitute
Whenever you want me, oho
