I'm gonna give you 40 days to get back home
I'm gonna call up a gypsy woman on the telephone
I'm gonna send out a worldwide hoo-doo there
The will be the very thing that suits you
I'm gonna see if she'll be back in 40 days

Oh, 40 days (40 days)
Oh, 40 days (40 days)
I'm gonna see if she'll be back in 40 day
I'm gonna send out a worldwide hoo-doo there
The will be the very thing that suits you
I'm gonna see if she'll be back in 40 days

I'm gonna talked to the Judge in private early this mornin'
He nearly took me to the Sheriff's Office to sign a warnin'
They gonna fore charge again' ya
That will be the very thing that'll send ya
I'm gonna see if she'll be back in 40 days

Oh, 40 days (40 days)
Oh, 40 days (40 days)
I'm gonna see if she'll be back in 40 day
I'm gonna send out a worldwide hoo-doo there
The will be the very thing that suits you
I'm gonna see if she'll be back in 40 days

Oh, 40 days (40 days)
Oh, 40 days (40 days)
I'm gonna see if she'll be back in 40 day
I'm gonna fore charge again' ya
That will be the very thing that'll send ya
I'm gonna see if she'll be back in 40 days
