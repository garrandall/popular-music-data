I'm not the one to tell you what clothes to wear
I'm not the one who talks about your hair
I'm not the one to show you how I feel inside
I'm not the one to say how much I care


Everytime you cry I cry just a little bit
-cry just a little bit
When you say goodbye, I die just a little bit
-cry just a little bit more

I know it's late, I guess I should have called today
I know you're tired of waiting by the phone
I know you said-you just don't know how long you'll wait
I know that you can live your life alone



In a world where there's no one to turn to
In a world where you think there's no one but you

But everytime you need someone to dry your eyes
You call my name and know that I'll be there
