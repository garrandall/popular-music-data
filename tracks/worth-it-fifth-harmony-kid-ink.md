Give it to me, I'm worth it
Baby, I'm worth it
Uh huh I'm worth it
Gimme gimme I'm worth it
Give it to me, I'm worth it
Baby, I'm worth it
Uh huh I'm worth it
Gimme gimme I'm worth it


OK, I tell her bring it back like she left some-
Bring it bring it back like she left some-
In the club with the lights off
Whatchu acting shy for?
Come and show me that you're with it with it with it with it with it
Stop playing, now you know that I'm with it with it with it with it with it with it
Whatchu acting shy for?


Just gimme you, just gimme you
Just gimme you, that's all I wanna do
And if what they say is true
If it's true, I might give me to you
I may talk a lot of stuff
Guaranteed, I can back it up
I think I'mma call you bluff
Hurry up, I'm waitin' out front


Uh huh, you see me in the spotlight
"Oh I love your style"
Uh huh show me what you got
'Cause I don't wanna waste my time
Uh huh see me in the spotlight
"Oh I love your style"
Uh huh show me what you got now
Come and make it worth my while


Give it to me, I'm worth it
Baby, I'm worth it
Uh huh I'm worth it
Gimme gimme I'm worth it
Give it to me, I'm worth it
Baby, I'm worth it
Uh huh I'm worth it
Gimme gimme I'm worth it


It's all on you, it's all on you
It's all on you, so what you wanna do?
And if you don't have a clue
Not a clue, I'll tell you what to do
Come harder just because
I don't like it, like it too soft
I like it a little rough
Not too much, but maybe just enough


Uh huh, you see me in the spotlight
"Oh I love your style"
Uh huh show me what you got
'Cause I don't wanna waste my time
Uh huh see me in the spotlight
"Oh I love your style"
Uh huh, show me what you got now
Come and make it worth my while


Give it to me, I'm worth it
Baby, I'm worth it
Uh huh I'm worth it
Gimme gimme I'm worth it
Give it to me, I'm worth it (know what I mean?)
Baby, I'm worth it (give me everything)
Uh huh I'm worth it
Gimme gimme I'm worth it


OK
I tell her bring it back like she left some-
Bring it bring it back like she left some-
In the club with the lights off
Whatchu acting shy for?
Come and show me that you're with it with it with it with it with it
Stop playing, now you know that I'm with it with it with it with it with it
Whatchu acting shy for?


Uh huh, you see me in the spotlight
"Oh I love your style"
Uh huh show me what you got
'Cause I don't wanna waste my time
Uh huh see me in the spotlight
"Oh I love your style"
Uh huh, show me what you got now
Come and make it worth my while


Give it to me, I'm worth it
Baby, I'm worth it
Uh huh I'm worth it
Gimme gimme I'm worth it
Give it to me, I'm worth it (know what I mean?)
Baby, I'm worth it (give me everything)
Uh huh I'm worth it
Gimme gimme I'm worth it

Give it to me, I'm worth it
