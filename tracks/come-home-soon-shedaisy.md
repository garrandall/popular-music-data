I put away the groceries
And I take my daily bread
I dream of your arms around me
As I tuck the kids in bed

I don't know what you're doin' 
And I don't know where you are
But I look up at that great big sky
And I hope you're wishin' on that same 
bright star

I wonder, I pray


And I sleep alone
I cry alone
And it's so hard livin' here on my own
So please, come home soon
(Come home soon)

I know that we're together
Even though we're far apart
And I'll wear our lucky penny 'round my neck 
Pressed to my heart

I wonder, I pray




I still imagine your touch
It's beautiful missing something that much
But sometimes love needs a fighting chance
So I'll wait my turn until it's our turn to dance

I wonder, I pray


I sleep alone
I cry alone
Without you this house is not a home
So please, come home soon


I walk alone
I try alone
I'll wait for you, don't want to die alone
So please, come home soon

Come home soon
Come home soon
