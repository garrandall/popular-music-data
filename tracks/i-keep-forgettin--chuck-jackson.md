I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more
I keep forgetting that you told me that
You didn't want me around anymore

But these stupid old feet just head for your street
Like they've done so many times before
And the stubborn old fists on the end of my wrists
Start knocking on your front door

I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more
I keep forgetting about those heartbreaking nights
And those heartbreaking things that you said

Though I know in my heart we've drifted apart
Still I can't believe our love is dead
Though it's plain as can be that you're finished with me
I just can't get it through my head

I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more

Though I know in my heart we've drifted apart
I can't believe our love is dead
Though it's plain as can be that you're finished with me
I just can't get it through my head

I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no more
But I just keep on forgetting, I keep on forgetting, darling
