Take off that wig, baby
I wanna see on your head, uh huh
Take off that wig, baby
I wanna see on your head
You hear what I said

Cause I ain't gonna marry you
And be scared to get in my bed
No, no

Now you got to
Take off that makeup, baby
I wanna see on your face, uh huh
Take off that makeup, baby
I wanna see on your face, yes, I do

If you don't look
Like what I want
I'll find another girl
To take your place

I don't expect you to be a queen
You might not think
I'm handsome myself
But when I get married
I don't want to have to
Look for nobody else

Do it, ha ha ha

Take off those stockings, baby
I wanna see on your legs
You all hear what I said
Take off those stockings, baby
I wanna see on your legs

Cause I ain't gonna marry you
If your legs look like scrambled eggs
No, no, uh uh

You got to take it off
Hear what I said, girl
You got to take it all off, ooh, yeah

You got to take it off, uh huh
You got to take it all off
Hear what I said, girl

You got to take your shoes off
You got to take your stockings off
You got to take your blouse off
You got to take your bra off
You got to take your skirt off
Last but not least, darling
You got to take your drawers off

Ha ha ha
You got to take it off
Every stitch, girl
You got to take it all off

Let me see you without that wig
You got to take it off, uh huh
You got to take it all off
