GREEN GRASS
(R.Greenaway/R.Cook)
GARY LEWIS AND THE PLAYBOYS - 1966
Green grass 'round my window, young leaves... that the wind blows
Yes it's springtime,.. golden sunshine
And we're glad my little love and I now that summer time is nigh!

Carefree 'kissin couples,... dream away all there troubles
'Cause it's springtime.. golden sunshine
While the bluebirds sing their magic song, we will love the summer long!

All the winter we've been waitin', Girl and I antipicating'

What we're gonna do.. with summer overdue!

Now it's here we're all together, so the weather man had better
Do his best to make a show and bring the sunshine out to grow the
Green grass 'round my window, young leaves that the wind blows
'Cause it's springtime... golden sunshine!

While the bluebirds sing their magic song
We will love the summer long
We will love the summer long
