Yeah yeah, oh oh
Dancin' in the dark, middle of the night
Takin' your heart and holdin' it tight
Emotional touch, touchin' my skin

And askin' you to do
What you've been doin' all over again
Oh, it's a beautiful thing
Don't think I can keep it all in

I just gotta let you know
What it is that won't let me go?
It's your love
It just does something to me

It sends a shock right through me
I can't get enough
And if you wonder
About the spell I'm under

Oh, it's your love
Better than I was, more than I am
And all of this happened by takin' your hand
And who I am now is who I wanted to be

And now that we're together
I'm stronger than ever, I'm happy and free
Oh, it's a beautiful thing
Don't think I can keep it all in

If you asked me why I've changed
All I gotta do is say your sweet name
It's your love
It just does something to me

It sends a shock right through me
I can't get enough
And if you wonder
About the spell I'm under
Oh, it's your love

Oh, oh, oh, baby
Oh, it's a beautiful thing
Don't think I can keep it all in
I just gotta let you know
What it is that won't let me go?

It's your love
It just does something to me
It sends a shock right through me
I can't get enough
And if you wonder

About the spell I'm under
Oh, it's your love
It's your love
It's your love
