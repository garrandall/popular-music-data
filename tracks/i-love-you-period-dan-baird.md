Hey, back when I was going to school
I never learned a thing
All I did was daydream
A-waitin' for the bell to ring

I had a certain teacher
I always tried to impress her
When she stood up in the classroom
I would mentally undress her

Then one day I decided
That I would write a little letter
She said the spelling was a masterpiece
The punctuation could be better

I understood what she was saying
I got the gist of her sentiment
She said, "I don't mean to be degrading
But here's the way that it shoulda went"

I love you period
And do you love me question mark
Please, please exclamation point
I want to hold you in parentheses
I love you period
And do you love me question mark
Please, please exclamation point
I want to hold you in parentheses

Come on, come on, come on

Right on up to high school
People said I was a writing fool
All my letters became really great
With punctuation that was never late

But I was having trouble meeting girls
I never knew the things to say
Soon I had 'em all overwhelmed
When they heard me talk this way
Like this

I love you period
And do you love me question mark
Please, please exclamation point
I want to hold you in parentheses
I love you period
Do you love me question mark
Please, please exclamation point
I want to hold you in parentheses, come on
I love you period
And do you love me question mark
Well, please, please exclamation point
Yeah, I want to hold you in parentheses
Oh, oh, oh
Whoo
