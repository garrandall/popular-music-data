Ah, ah, ah, ah

You better stop, girl, doggin' me around (You better stop it)
Stop it, baby
Cause if you don't stop, I'm gonna put you down

I can't take it much longer
My heart's getting weak, it's not getting any stronger
You keep me so upset, my head's in a whirl
But, if you wanna, if you wanna be my girl

You better stop, girl, doggin' me around (You better stop it)
Stop it, baby (You better stop it)
Cause if you don't stop, I'm gonna have to put you down

You go out at night and have yourself a ball
Sometimes you don't, you don't make it home at all
I don't mind you having yourself a real good time
But now whatcha trying to do, trying to make me lose my mind

You better stop girl yeah
You better stop
Hey you better stop

You better stop, girl, doggin' me around (You better stop it)
Stop it, baby (You better stop it)
Cause if you don't stop, I, I'm gonna have to put you down
(You better stop it)
Don't make me do it (You better stop it)
Stop it, baby, yeah
