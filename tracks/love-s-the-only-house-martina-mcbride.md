I was standing in the grocery store line
The one they marked express
When this woman came through with about 25 things
And I said don't you know that more is less
She said this world is movin' so fast
I just get more behind with every day
And every mornin' when I make my coffee
I can't believe my life's turned out this way
All I could say was

Love's the only house big enough for all the pain in the world
Love's the only house big enough for all the pain

He was walkin' by the other day and I said
Hey baby...how you been
Yeah I got me a little girl now and she's 4 years old
And she's got her daddy's little grin
And you only wanted what you can't have
And baby you can't have me now
I gave me heart to another
Yeah I'm a mother and he's a father and we're a family and we got each other
And I found out the hard way that

Love's the only house big enough for all the pain in the world
Love's the only house big enough for all the pain

You drive three miles from all this prosperity
Down across the river and you see a ghetto there
And we got children walking around with guns
And they got knives and drugs and pain to spare
And here I am in my clean white shirt
With a little money in my pocket and a nice warm home
And we got teenagers walkin' around in a culture of darkness
Livin' together alone...all I can

Love's the only house big enough for all the pain in the world
Love's the only house big enough for all the pain

And I can't explain it and I can't understand
But I'll come down and get my hands dirty and together we'll make a stand
Somewhere 'cross the parking lot some bands playin' out of tune
City streets are gonna burn if we don't do something soon
And se?orita can't quit cryin baby's due now any day
Don Juan left got sick of trying
No one there to show him the way
She came down to the grocery store and she said I
I wanna buy a little carton of milk but I don't have any money
I said hey I'll cover you honey 'cause the pain's gotta go somewhere
Yeah the pain's gotta go someplace
So come on down to my house
Don't you know that

Love's the only house big enough for all the pain in the world
Love's the only house big enough for all the pain
Don't you know that
Love's the only house big enough for all the pain in the world
Love's the only house big enough for all the pain
