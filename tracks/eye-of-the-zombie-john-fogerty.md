Hoo! Oooooh!

Shadows on the mountain, and the night begins to fall;
Gather up the children, 'fore the darkness takes us all.
Tribe has come together, standin' naked against the night;
Twenty feet from the fire, the evil waits with zombie eyes.


Eye-eye-eye eye of the Zombie!
Eye-eye-eye eye of the Zombie!

Oh! Sneakin' through the long grass on leopard feet silently,
A beast already dead comes to join the dance on the zombie.
Ooh! Time has come again - again the moment of truth;
The terror is at hand, and there's nothin' you can do.



Oh! Hoo! Aaa-aah! Hoo! Aaa-aaa-aaaah!

From out of nowhere he's there, flashing hideous teeth,
Panic in the crowd, helter-skelter, we're brought to our knees.
Back to the darkness, back on the mountain he stands,
You can't fight a shadow, you can't kill a dead man.
