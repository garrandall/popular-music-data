Now and then you see me falling, way behind the things I need to do
Don't you believe I've missed my calling, I'm just the one to play your fool


Under the gun, under the gun, I'm down and crawlin' like I've never done
Under the gun, under the gun, standing in my own way and nowhere to run

Waited so long it felt like a lifetime and looking up just seemed so far away
Between these walls I live on the bottom line
It's just enough to get me through the day



Now and then you see me falling, way behind the things I need to do
Don't you believe I've missed my calling, I'm just the one to play your fool
