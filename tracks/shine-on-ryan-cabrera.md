I've given every moment I had
Still I can never seem to keep up with you
You're done with one mile, and on to another one thousand
Still I could never seem to keep up with you

I know you'll be better off without me when I'm gone
You know you're beautiful
You're beautiful


Shine on
You were made to shine on
and you know I love you
even if we can or can't be friends I'll be with you till the very end
Shine on
You were made to

It's keeping me awake everynight
But I can never seem to give up on you
I send up a prayer and I'm on to another one thousand
But I can never seem to give up on you

I know you'll be better off without me when I'm gone
You know you're beautiful
You're beautiful


Shine on
You were made to shine on
and you know I love you
even if we can or can't be friends I'll be with you till the very end
Shine on
You were made to

Nobody's wrong
Nobody's right
Keep moving on

Shine on
You were made to shine on


Shine on
You were made to shine on
and you know I love you
even if we can or can't be friends
You're gonna be better than you've ever been so
Shine on

You're gonna be just fine
You're gonna be alright love
You're gonna be just fine
You're gonna be alright love
