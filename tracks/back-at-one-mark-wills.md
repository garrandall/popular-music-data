Its undeniable... that we should be together...
Its unbelievable how I used to say that I'd fall never
The basis you need to know, if you don't know just how I feel,
Then let me show you now that I'm for real...
If all things in time, time will reveal...
Yeah...

One... you're like a dream come true...
Two... just wanna be with you...
Three... Gurl its plain to see... that you're the only one for me... and
Four... repeat steps one through three...
Five... make you fall in love with me...
If ever I believe my work is done... then I start Back at One.(yeah)

So Incredible... the way things work themselves out...
And all emotional, once you know what its all about babe...
And undesirable... for us to be apart...
Never would of made it very far...
Cause you know you got the keys to my heart
Cause...

One... you're like a dream come true
Two... just wanna be with you
Three... Gurl its plain to see.that you're the only one for me
Four... repeat steps one through three
Five... make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done... then I start Back at One...

Say farewell to the dark night... I see the coming of the sun...
I feel like a little child.whose life has just begun...
You came and breathed new life,
Into this lonely heart of mine...
You threw out the life line... just in the Nick of Time

One... you're like a dream come true
Two... just wanna be with you
Three... Gurl its plain to see.that you're the only one for me.and...
Four... repeat steps one through three
Five... make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done... then I start Back at One.
