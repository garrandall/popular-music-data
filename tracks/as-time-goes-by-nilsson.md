You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply as time goes by
And when two lovers woo
They still say "I love you"
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings,
as time goes by
Moonlight and love songs never out of date

Hearts full of passion, jealousy, and hate
Woman needs man, and man must have his mate
That no one can deny
It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers as time goes by
