I've seen you, Annabella,
Moving softly through my mind.
And the vision stays,
Through my nights and lonely days.

Annabella, I'm coming home.
I should have known I'd need you so.
Annabella you've been so true
I know.

I've seen you Annabella
Down the inroads of my soul.
How can I be free?
You've become a part of me.

Annabella, I'm coming home
I should have known I'd need you so.
Annabella you've been so true
I know.

I've been, oh, so wrong.
And I've been gone too long.
Away from the arms that reach out for me.
Away from the love I know to be in you.

Annabella, I'm coming home,
I should have known I'd need you so.
Annabella, I'm coming home,
I should have known I'd need you so.
Annabella, I'm coming home,
I should have known I'd need you so.
