County road 233, under my feet
Nothing on this white rock but little olâ€™ me
I've got two miles 'till he makes bail
And if I'm right, we're headed straight for hell


I'm going home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
If he wants a fight, well, now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
He slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man?
I'm gonna show him what little girls are made of
Gunpowder and lead


Well, it's half past ten, another six-pack in
And I can feel the rumble like a cold black wind
He pulls in the drive, the gravel flies
He don't know what's waitin' here this time


Hey, I'm going home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
If he wants a fight, well, now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
He slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man?
I'm gonna show him what little girls are made of
Gunpowder and lead


His fist is big, but my gun's bigger
He'll find out when I pull the trigger


I'm going home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
If he wants a fight, well, now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
He slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man?
I'm gonna show him what little girls are made of
Gunpowder and, gunpowder and lead
Gunpowder and lead, yeah, yeah, hey
