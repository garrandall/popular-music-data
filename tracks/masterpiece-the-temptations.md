Where I was born ev`rything was dull and dingy
I lived in a place they called the inner city
Getting ahead huh was strictly a nono
Cause nobody cares what happens to the folks
That live in the ghetto
Thousands of lives wasting away
People living from day to day
It`s a challenge just staying alive
`Cause in the ghetto only the strong survive

Money I ain`t got none, job can`t find one
The streets raised me from a baby, ooh
Thousands of lives wasting away
People living from day to day
It`s a challenge just staying alive
`Cause in the ghetto only the strong survive

Broken down homes, kids strung out
They don`t even know what life`s all about
Stealin` cars, robbin` bars
Mugging drugs, rat infested
And no one`s interested

Kids dodging cars for recreation
Only adds to a mother`s frustration
Breakings, folks comin` home
And finding all their possessions gone
Oh it`s an ev`ry day thing - well well - in the ghetto
Oh it`s an ev`ry day thing in the ghetto
