Got somethin' for you darlin'
That you never never had
Well somethin' for you darlin'
That you've never never had
I got a lotta
Good lovin', good lovin'
Make me feel so bad
Give somethin' to me baby
When you know you're fine
Give somethin' to me baby
Just a little bit of time
Some of your
Good lovin, good lovin'
Make me feel so fine
Oh

True fine lovin'
A whole lotta huggin'
You're nothin' but a lover
Baby I need
Your good lovin'

Got somethin' for you baby
You know you're outta sight
Got somethin' for you baby
Come on treat me right
Some of your
Good lovin', good lovin'
Good lovin' tonight

Eeee
True fine lovin'
A whole lotta huggin'
You're nothin' but a lover
Oh baby I need
Your good lovin'

Got somethin' for you baby
That you never never had
Got somethin' for you baby
That you never never had
I gotta lotta
Good lovin', good lovin'
Make me feel so bad
Oh
Good good lovin'
A whole lotta lovin'
