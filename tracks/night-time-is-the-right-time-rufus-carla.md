I've got someone to take...


You know the night time is the right time
To be with the one you love
With the one you love, with the one you love
Oh, my darling, ain’t you better I think enough
You know the night time, yeah, yeah, is the right time
To be with the one you love
With the one you love, you, darling 


Baby, baby (I've set down )
Baby (How it ?)
Walk to me there ()
You know I love you
You know I love you
Now hold me tight
I'll make everything alright
Because the night time, you know is the right time
To be with the one you love
I want it one more time, darling!


Please me (You know I’ll do my )
Please me (I wanna take you right, baby)
Please me (I wanna take your right time, baby)
Oh, please me (Oh, I wanna please you, babe)
Oh, baby! (Oh!)
Take my hand (You know I wanna take your hand)
I don't need (I know, I know)
That I know, babe (I know you don't need, I don't know )
That the night time, you know is the right time (Oh, yeah, yeah)
To be with the one you love (I know you want it)


I say it right, yeah (You're doing it good at this time)
With the one you love
With the one you love
With the one you love
With the one you love
With the one you love, with the one you love (Haha!)
With the one you love...
With the one you love...
