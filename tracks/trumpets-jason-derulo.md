Every time that you get undressed
I hear symphonies in my head
I wrote this song just looking at you oh, oh
Yeah the drums they swing low
And the trumpets they go
And the trumpets they go
Yeah the trumpets they go

Da da, da ra ra da
Oh-oh
They go

Is it weird that I hear
Violins whenever you're gone
Whenever you're gone
Is it weird that your ass
Remind me of a Kanye West song?
Kanye West song

Is it weird that I hear
Trumpets when you're turning me on?
Turning me on
Is it weird that your bra
Remind me of a Katy Perry song?

Every time that you get undressed
I hear symphonies in my head
I wrote this song just looking at you oh, oh
Yeah the drums they swing low
And the trumpets they go
(And they playing for you girl)
And the trumpets they go
(Ha, yeah)
Yeah the trumpets they go

Yeah the trumpets they go
(Go, go-go, go-go, go, go-go)
And they go

(Damn) Is it weird that I hear
Angels every time that you moan?
Time that you moan
Is it weird that your eyes
Remind me of a Coldplay song?
Coldplay song

Is it weird that I hear
Trumpets when you're turning me on?
Turning me on
Is it weird that your bra
Remind me of a Katy Perry song?

Every time that you get undressed
I hear symphonies in my head
I wrote this song looking at you oh, oh
Oh, yeah

Every time (Every time) that you get undressed
(Every time that you get undressed)
I hear symphonies in my head
(I hear symphonies in my head)
I wrote this song (I wrote this song) just looking at you
Oh, oh (Just looking at you girl)
Yeah the drums they swing low
And the trumpets they go

(A capella on 'em)
There you go, oh-oh, yeah
Come on, come on, come on
There you go
