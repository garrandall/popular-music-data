Still in love...
Mmm
I'm still in love
(With you)
With you
La da da da, La da da da, La da da da, La da da da, La da da da, La da da da
Still in love
(Listen)


Oh, what can I do, girl?
So much in love, girl
But your friends gotcha thinkin'
And it's affecting you
(Don't listen, baby)
What can I do, girl?
So in love, girl
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I don't wanna lose you


No
What would I do without your love?
Baby, it's heaven sent from above
So you don't believe
What your friends tell you about me


I'm still the man for you
And I'm still the man that's true
And I'm still the man who's lucky
And I'm still in love with you
It don't matter what your friends do
They're just jealous of me and you
And I'll always keep you happy
'Cause I'm still in love with you
(I'm still in love) Yeah


Time passes so fast, babe
I wish it would last, babe
'Cause I know in my heart
That my life ends and starts with you, yeah
And, baby, I know that this feelin'
I'm feelin' just won't let me go, baby
(You know why)
'Cause you're the first true love I've ever known


So what would I do without your love?
Baby, it's heaven sent from above
And I know that in my heart
I'm the best for you


I'm still the man for you
(Whoa-oh)
And I'm still the man that's true
(I'm still the man, baby)
And I'm still the man who's lucky
(Ooo ho)
And I'm still in love with you
(I said, I'm still in love with you)
It don't matter what your friends do
(Don't matter what they say to you)
They're just jealous of me and you
(It don't matter)
And I'll always keep you happy
(It just don't matter)
(The only thing that matters is that I'm still in love with you)
'Cause I'm still in love with you
(Woo)


Ohhh
What can I do to right this wrong?
I know that it makes me happy
To be in love with you
Sooo


I'm still the man for you
(Hey, baby)
And I'm still the man that's true
(Darling, I'm still the man, baby)
And I'm still the man who's lucky
(The man)
(Woah, yea)
And I'm still in love with you
(Oh, aw yeah)
It don't matter what your friends do
(You see it don't matter)
They're just jealous of me and you
(It don't matter)
(Said, it don't matter)
And I'll always keep you happy
(It don't matter)
('Cause I'll always)
(Always)
'Cause I'm still in love with you
(Oh)


No one loves you
(Like)
Like I love you
I still love you
(You)
I'm in love with you
(Said)
I'm still the man for you, baby
And I'll always make you happy
I'll always be there, baby
'Cause I'm still in love
Still in love with you...
