Whatâs it gone be, tonight?
Whatâs it gone be?
Whatâs it gone be, tonight?
Whatâs it gone be?
We drop flows in your area codes
We take it back to the school of old
Itâs Nesian in your area code
S.A.B.R.E proceed to let them know



Use to rock the flat top with the multi coloured shades / Mustard jeans with the high top kicks laced / New edition pumping out the old decks / Queen St shuffle with the ghetto blaster in check / Beat street, take it to the floor cuz / Then it all morphed when Kris Kross arose up / Not before Hammer wore Aladdin pants / obody said they like Vanilla Ice but they danced / Watched KidânâPlay imitating synchronised moves/ Michael wasnât bad but bad meaning good / The kings of rock were Run D.M.C / And the grand master Flash took the message to the streets / L.L cool J was old school then / So what does that make him now? Still flowing with the trends / You know what time it is like Flava fla / Its old school still loving it like âHip hop holidayâ



Now you gone and did it
Get on up and donât you stop for a minute
Donât stop, donât stop
Now you gone and did it
Get on up and donât you stop for a minute
Donât stop, donât stop



Hey Mr.Telephone man/ Let me drop you a line/ Let me Rock It like Herby / Watch the place ignite / What you say? Nesian keep it hot / Cool it now? Slow it down? / Uh-uh donât stop/ We keep it flowing, drop it like Purple Rain / times may change but the groove stays the same / So whatâs it gone be? Regardless we keep it hype/ On your Sound machine, banging rhythms of the night / Cos this is Thriller, Nah, its just me/ O-L-D to the O-N-E / You thought we wouldnât but You know we have and / We gone continue till the road ends like Boyz II Men / Step into our world, Walk this way / The beat goes on, put this track on the replay / Dukes of Hazard, we gone cut to the chase / If we aint got ya moving, then that the breaks /





So as I hit the streets as I beat the feet a little reminder bit of labamba now you feel the heat / Im a make you feel the zap just like Rogers with his coloured suits rocking those high collars 3. 2. 1 PUMP no you cant touch poppers n lockers always throwing down ish / Thanks for the music, lost in emotion, Africa bumbata got you feeling the notion / Turning up the jams from the box with cassette tape breakin on the streets bystanders would imitate 6 of the many in this / Musical Youth to the dance floor now let me see you get loose âPOISON- like Bel Biv Dvoe shake it on the floor like Turbo and O Zone / Hurt Nobody while doing the Wild Thing, Up Jump the Boogy coz your making me say



Whatâs it gone be, tonight?
Whatâs it gone be?
Whatâs it gone be, tonight?
Whatâs it gone be?
