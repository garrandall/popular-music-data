This is my love song
This is my love song to you

Hold my hand
Baby squeeze it tight as you can
Girl, don't ever let go (don't you ever)
Until I tell you to now

Look in my eyes
Baby, look into my eyes
Can't you see that I idolize
Everything that you do now

Let the beat stay
Just pretend 
Cause I got you and you got me

This is my love song
This is my love song to you
Oh, baby
This is my love song
This is my love song to you

Here's my heart
Treat it gentle treat is kind
Cause girl you'll never find
Another so driven so geniune

Give me your heart
I won't break it never miss you
Oh I can't afford to lose
The love I really need now

Let the music play
Make the world go away
Cause I love you
And you love me

This is my love song
This is my love song to you
Baby hold me in love
Baby, this is my love song
This is my love song to you
Baby hold me in your arms
This is my love song
This is my love song to you
