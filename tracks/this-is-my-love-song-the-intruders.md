I found you, cleared land
Put down my flag
This is mine from now on
When I see intruders
I load up my weapons
And fire my cannons
I wrote my name
Everywhere
For all eyes to see
You're beautiful, beautiful
I see them stare
But you belong to me

So please, no intruders
I'd kill all intruders
'Cause my love is ruthless
So please no intruders

I wrote you a love song
A war song
I'll sing it when the ships come, yeah
I'll die for my state
Love in my veins
You are my kingdom
I wrote your name
Everywhere
For all eyes to see
You're beautiful, beautiful
I see them stare
But you belong to me

So please, no intruders
I'd kill all intruders
'Cause my love is ruthless
So please, no intruders

Please, no intruders
I'd kill all intruders
'Cause my love is ruthless
So please, no intruders

I got heads on the table
Heads on a stake
Of people that failed
And done made the mistake of thinking
I'd let them in
But this is my land
So don't you come in
This is my land

So please, no intruders
I'd kill all intruders
'Cause my love is ruthless
So please, no intruders
