I wanna be a billionaire so freakin' bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shinin' lights
Yeah, a different city every night
Oh I, I swear, the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire


Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah
I would be the host of, everyday Christmas
Give Artie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had it

Give away a few Mercedes like "here lady, have this"
And last but not least grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Artie Claus minus the Ho Ho
Haa, get it?

I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And darn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me stupid
Everywhere I go Imma have my own theme music


Oh, every time I close my eyes
(what chu see, what chu see bro?)
I see my name in shining lights
(uh huh)
Ah, yeah yeah
(what else?)
A different city every night
Oh I, I swear, the world better prepare
(for what?)
For when I'm a billionaire
(yeah!)
Oh oh oh oh
When I'm a Billionaire
Oh oh oh oh
(let's go)


I'll be playing basketball with the President
Dunking on his delegates
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple million in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twentys, tens and bens completely separate

Yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatevers left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks

And, not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket, pull out your wallet, put it in the air and sing...


I wanna be a billionaire so freakin' bad
(So bad)
Buy all of the things I never had
(Buy everything, haa)
Uh.
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen
(What up Oprah? Haaa!)

Oh every time I close my eyes
(what chu see, what chu see bro?)
I see my name in shinin' lights
(uh huh)
Ah, yeah yeah
(what else?)
A different city every night
Oh (yeah yeah yeah)
I - I swear, the world better prepare
(for what?)
For when I'm a billionaire
(yeah!)
Oh oh oh oh
(Sing it)
When I'm a Billionaire
Oh oh oh oh

I wanna be a billionaire
So freakin' bad
