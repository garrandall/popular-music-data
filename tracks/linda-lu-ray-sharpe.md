Well, they call my Baby, Patty
But her real name, her real name, her real name is Linda Lu
Well now now they call my Baby, Patty
But her real name, her real name, her real name is Linda Lu
She's so fine, fair and pretty
You never know what my Baby's gonna do
My Linda Lu
Now when she goes stroling down the street
All the cats, All the cats, All the cats
Turn to look around
Well now she gives everybody the eye
You never know, You never know,
What my Baby's gonna put down
Everybody always tells me
I got the cutest little girl in town
I'm gonna marry that girl
Next Saturday night
I'll stay with her for the rest of my life
From now on my rovin' days are through
And it's all because of that chick, a-Linda Lu
Linda Lu, Linda Lu, tell me, tell me, tell me
What are you gonna do
I had a real bad dream last night, Honey
You said, you said, you said that we were through
Well now, if you ever leave me
You're gonna break my poor heart in two
My Linda Lu
