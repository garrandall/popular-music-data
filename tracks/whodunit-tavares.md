Whodunit
Who stole my baby
Whodunit
Everyone in the room looks shady
Whodunit
Who stole my girl from me (Yeah)
Whodunit
Who took my honey
Whodunit
I know the motive was not funny
Whodunit
It's a bedside mystery (Yeah, yeah)

Hey, where's the phone to call Sherlock Holmes
(Somebody took my baby)
I've been framed by what's his name
And he's gettin' away Charlie Chan, see if you can
Help me find those two, won't you
Where were you on the night of the 12th
(I was by myself)
She went dancin' in the dark,
Somebody stole her heart Ellery Queen if you're so keen
Won't you help me find my sweet thing (Yeah, yeah)

Whodunit
Who stole my baby
Whodunit
Everyone in the room looks shady
Whodunit
Who stole my girl from me (Yeah)
Whodunit
(Whodunit)
Who took my honey
Whodunit
I know the motive was not funny
Whodunit
(Whodunit)
It's a bedside mystery

The place is surrounded
(The place is surrounded)
Nobody leaves till I found her
(Nobody leaves till I found her)
Until this case is solved
It's up against the wall, you all

Whodunit
(I wonder, wonder who)
Who stole my baby
Whodunit
(Whodunit)
Everyone in the room looks shady
Whodunit
(I wonder who, was is you)
Who stole my girl from me
(Hey Baretta, won't you please go get her)
Whodunit
(For cryin' out loud)
Who took my honey
Whodunit
(Somebody call McCloud)
I know the motive was not funny
Whodunit
(Where is my baby)
It's a bedside mystery
(Yeah, Kojak won't you bring her back)
Whodunit
(Ironside, don't you let her slide)
Who stole my baby
Whodunit
(Tell Dirty Harry)
Everyone in the room looks shady
(We're supposed to get married)
Whodunit
Who stole my girl from me
(From me, from me
