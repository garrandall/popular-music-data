I look in the mirror, but I look at a stranger
Can this be the sensible me who said he wouldn't fall in love
I suddenly saw you, and I knew there was danger
Why run away when I love you and want you forever
I know I'm a dreamer, but I don't want to wake up
Whenever you touch me I can fly to the sky

To the door of the sun, to the ends of the sea
I will travel anywhere as long as you are there with me
On the wings of the wind, in the arms of a storm
It is always summer weather, with your love to keep me warm

To the door of the sun, to the ends of the sea
I will travel anywhere as long as you are there with me
There is no-one else but you
There is no-one else but you

I look in the future, the golden tomorrows
As long as you're walking beside me, I'll always be a dreamer
As long as we're sharing, the smiles and the sorrows
Make everyday we're together, a day to remember
I have no illusions, just a heart full of lovin'
It's a wonderful world I know, whenever you're near

To the door of the sun, to the ends of the sea
I will travel anywhere as long as you are there with me
On the wings of the wind, in the arms of a storm
It is always summer weather, with your love to keep me warm

To the door of the sun, to the ends of the sea
I will travel anywhere as long as you are there with me
There is no-one else but you
There is no-one else but you
No-one but you...
