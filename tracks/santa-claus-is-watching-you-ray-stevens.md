Now baby doll, sweetie-pie, sugarplum
Honey-bunch, angel face
You know you better be good
And act like two fine lovers should
Be careful what you say and do
'Cause Santa Claus is watchin' you
He's everywhere, he's everywhere

You'd better kiss and hold me tight
And give me good lovin' every night
'Cause you'll be sorry if ya make me blue
'Cause Santa Claus is watchin' you
He's everywhere, he's everywhere

Well you may thing you can sneak around
And get away with something but there ain't no way
'Cause Santa's no fool, he's really super cool
He's the secret head of the CIA
Eesh, Iish, crime don't pay
You can't do nothin' 'cause you're never alone
He's even got a wire tap on your phone

So baby if you ever do me wrong
Break my heart and leave me alone
When Christmas comes, you'll b crying too
'Cause Santa Claus is watching you
He's everywhere, he's everywhere

Every Christmas eve, he climbs on his sled full of toys
With fuel exhaust and side mirrors
The fox tails,the mud flaps the leopard-skin seats covers
And spreads Christmas cheer to all good little girls and boys

Then he says on Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid
Donner and Blitzen and Bruce and Marvin, Leon
Cletus and George and Bill and Slick and Do-right
Clyde and Ace and Blackie and Queenie
And Prince and Spot and Rover

So where's Rudolph
He's on a stakeout at your house
You can run, you can hide, but you can't get away
Got binoculars focused on you everyday

So baby if you ever do me wrong
Break my heart and leave me alone
When Christmas comes, you'll b crying too
'Cause Santa Claus is watching you
He's everywhere, he's everywhere

Yeah, Santa Claus is watchin' you
He's everywhere oh Lord have mercy!
Santa Claus has got his eyes all over you baby
You you better watch out hoo!
Look out there Santa Claus is peepin' around the corner at you

You're in deep trouble, you know that?
I don't think you understand the situation
I got a call into the North Pole right now
Them little elves gonna come down here, whoop up on you
I'm mean you got to be true blue - through and through
Or Santa's gonna get you!
