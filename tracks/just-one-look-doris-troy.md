Just one look and I fell so hard
In love with you

I found out how good it feels
To have your love

Say you will be mine
Forever and always

Just one look and I knew
That you were my only one

I thought I was dreaming
But I was wrong, yeah yeah yeah
But I'm gonna keep on scheming
Until I make you, make you my own

So you see I really care
Without you, I'm nothing

Just one look and I know
I'll get you someday

Just one look that's all it took
Just one look that's all it took...
