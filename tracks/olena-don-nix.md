Twenty miles out of Memphis
I  been gone three months or more
When  I get back down on Popl
She'll be standing in my door

I've been all over Texas
To  see what I could see
Tombstone  towns and bar room clowns
A longing to be free

I  get high, Olena
I get high, don't you see now
I get high, Olena
Shine your loving light on me
Shine  your loving light on me

I left her there in Memphis
My guitar in my hand

I get high, Olena
I get high, don't you see now
I get high, Olena
Shine your loving light on me
Shine your loving light on me

I get high, Olena
I get high, don't you see now
I get high, Olena
Shine your loving light on me
Shine your loving light on me
