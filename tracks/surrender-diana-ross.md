I want the love that you deny me
That I need so desperately
The tenderness that you posses
You've deprived me

You must pray for the lonely night
That I walked the floor for you
And don't know you must erase
All the tearstairs on my face

Surrender your love baby
Surrender your love
Surrender your love baby
Surrender your love

Don't you know that I'm taking my case
To the highest court of love
And these are some of the charges
You'll be found guilty of

You've used me and abused me
'Till I felt like I wanted to die
You created a need in me
That only you can satisfy

Surrender your love baby
Surrender your love
Come along peacefully
Surrender your love baby
Surrender your love

Give it to me, ah right now
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me all, give it to me
Ah, right now, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me

Surrender your love baby
Surrender your love
Surrender your love baby
Surrender your love

Surrender your love baby
Surrender your love
Surrender your love baby
Surrender your love
