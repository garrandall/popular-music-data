Here I sit all alone, thinkin' 'bout what I should have known
You made me think that I could need you
You weaved your magic spell and I believed you
Lookin back on you and me, promises that will never be
I truly thought we were lovers
But now I find that I'm just like all the others

Heartbreaker, wish that I had seen that love was blind
Sweet little love maker, takin my heart and leave me behind
Heartbreaker couldn't you be
Just a little more kind to me

Played with fire, felt its burn
I would have thought that I would have learned
I melted every time you kissed me (kissed me)
Each time you'd leave I thought that you would miss me

Heartbreaker, wish that I had seen that love was blind
Sweet little love maker, takin' my heart and leave me behind
Heartbreaker couldn't you be
Just a little more kind to me

Heartbreaker, wish that I had seen that love was blind
Sweet little love maker, takin' my heart and leave me behind
Heartbreaker couldn't you be
Just a little more kind to me

Heartbreaker, wish that I had seen that love was blind
Sweet little love maker, takin' my heart and leave me behind
Heartbreaker couldn't you be
Just a little more kind to me
