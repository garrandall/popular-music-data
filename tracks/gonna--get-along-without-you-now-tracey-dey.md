Bye, bye bye, baby
Now don't cry, baby
You gotta, gotta get along
Bye bye, baby, bye bye

Bye bye, baby
You drove me crazy
You'be been doing
Doing, doing me wrong

Got along without you before I met you
Gonna get along without you now
Gonna find me somebody twice as cute
Cause you didn't love you anyhow

You ran around with every girl in town
Never cared if it drug me down
Got along without you before I met you
Gonna get along without you now

Got along without you before I met you
Gonna get along without you now
Gonna find me somebody twice as cute
Cause you didn't love you anyhow

I lost my money and I lost my pride
Didn't have much fun but I really tried
Got along without you before I met you
Gonna get along without you now

Bye, bye bye, baby
Now don't cry, baby
You gotta, gotta get along
Bye bye, baby, bye bye

Bye bye, baby
You drove me crazy
You'be been doing
Doing, doing me wrong

It made you happy when you made me cry
You broke my heart so I said goodbye
Got along without you before I met you
Gonna get along without you now

Bye, bye bye, baby
Now don't cry, baby
You gotta, gotta get along
Bye bye, baby, bye bye

Bye bye, baby
You drove me crazy
You'be been doing
Doing, doing me wrong

Go away now, bye bye now

Bye, bye bye, baby
Now don't cry, baby
You gotta, gotta get along
Bye bye, baby, bye bye
