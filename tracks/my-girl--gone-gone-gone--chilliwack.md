Gone gone gone, she been gone so long
She been gone gone gone so long
Gone gone gone, she been gone so long
A-gone gone gone gone so long
Gone gone gone, she been gone so long
Wonder if I ever gonna see my girl
Gone gone gone, she been gone so long
Wonder if I ever gonna see my girl

Ever since she left me
I sure feel all alone
A little misunderstanding
I can't get her on the telephone

Hanging out down on Main Street
Living in a different world
Standing around
With the gang on the corner
Talking about my girl

My girl, she was the world to me
She's gone away across the sea
My girl is just a memory
She been so long away

Gone gone gone, she been gone so long
She been gone gone gone so long
Gone gone gone, she been gone so long
A-gone gone gone gone so long
Gone gone gone, she been gone so long
She been gone gone gone so long

She didn't have to leave me
She didn't have to run
She didn't have to go
Without a word to anyone

I hope she's doing all right
Got no way to know
Unless she gets to hear this song
Hear it on the radio

My girl, she was the world to me
She's gone and that's a tragedy
My girl is just a memory
She been so long away

Gone gone gone, she been gone so long
She been gone gone gone so long
Gone gone gone, she been gone so long
She been gone gone gone so long
Gone gone gone, she been gone so long
A-gone gone gone gone, she been gone so long
Gone gone gone, she been gone so long
A-well I wonder if I ever gonna see my girl (Wonder if I ever gonna)
Gone gone gone, she been gone so long
A-well I wonder if I ever gonna see my girl (Wonder if I ever gonna)

Well, I hope she gets the message
Gotta get her back you know
Gonna track her down, I'll find that girl
Gonna tell her that I love her so

Put the word on the grapevine
Spread it all around the world
Sooner or later, I know I'm gonna get her
Talkin' about my girl, my girl

My girl, my girl, my girl, my girl...
