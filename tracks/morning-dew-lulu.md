Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
Can't walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
Can't walk you out in the morning dew, at all

Thought I heard a young man crying, oh baby
Thought I heard a young man crying today
You didn't hear no young man crying, baby
You didn't hear no young man crying, at all

Thought I heard a young man crying, oh baby
Thought I heard a young man crying today
You didn't hear no young man crying, baby
You didn't hear no young man crying, at all

Now there's no more morning dew
Now there's no more morning dew
What they were saying all these years was true
Now there's no more morning dew

Thought I heard a young man crying, baby
Thought I heard a young man crying today
You didn't hear no young man crying, baby
You didn't hear no young man crying, at all

Now there's no, no, no, no, no morning dew
