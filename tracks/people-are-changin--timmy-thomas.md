People are changing
I said people people are changing
This whole world this whole world is changing
How do I know let me tell you so

Here's an example
Take the time
When it used to be man to boy
Take the time when we all had to go from front to back

There's more love for your fellow man
Thousands of people joining hands
Oh people are changing
I said people people are changing
Don't you know this whole world this whole world is changing

How do I know let me tell you so

One more example
Take the time
When we were afraid to even talk
White and black red and yellow never could walk side by side
Now we can

There's more love for your fellow man
Thousands of people all of us joining hands
People everybody's changing
People oh people are changing
I said people people are changing

Don't you people came from far and near
You know why they came? There's more love for your fellow man
Thousands of people all of us joining hands
Everybody's changing people
Do it with me
People are changing
