When I knew I was gonna get it I'd hide if I could
'Cause when momma put on on ya she'd put it on ya good
I'd squirm and scream and jump around and try to get away
Oh but she'd just hold me tighter and this is what she'd say

You ain't leavin' here without a kiss
I know you think I'm silly, but that's just the way it is
'Til we're together again I'll wear your love upon my lips
Honey, you ain't leavin' here without a kiss

Now brother's off to Camp Lejeune with the proud and the few
Daddy shook his hand and said "Son, go do what you gotta do"
Yeah he was big and bad and full of fight and almost 6 foot 4
Oh but the one he wouldn't mess with was standing in the door
And she said

You ain't leavin' here without a kiss
I know you think I'm silly, but that's just the way it is
'Til we're together again I'll wear your love upon my lips
Baby, you ain't leavin' here without a kiss

Daddy took to cancer, nothin' left to do
When he slipped into a coma, we knew his days were few
But he was hangin' on and holdin' out, as stubborn as could be
And we didn't know the reason why he wouldn't leave
But when momma whispered in his ear, I knew the reason why
There was only one thing left to do, and he opened up his eyes
And he whispered

I ain't leavin' here without a kiss
I know I'll love you forever, and that's just the way it is
'Til we're together again I'll wear your love upon my lips
Baby, I ain't leavin' here without a kiss
Honey, I ain't leavin' here without a kiss
