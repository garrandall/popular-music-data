A little while ago I went and placed a call
To tell this girl I know that she could have it all
The wedding ring, the whole dumb thing
I was willing to tie the knot
So I called her up, and this is the answer I got...


I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine
I'm not in, and listen, I'm sure you know this whole routine
Leave your name and number
And I'll try and get back to you
You have thirty seconds to talk to me before you're threw

And I said, "Baby lets go get married.  
I need to know you're mine!
I am hangin' on, I am hangin' on, I am hangin' on this line
And if I can leave one message
Before you go to bed, I would say to you..." 
 And the phone went dead

So I stepped down to buy some dog food for the cat
Of course she called about three minutes after that
Will she be my wife and share my life?
Well of course she can write the plot
Cause she called my up, and this is the answer she got


I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine
I'm not in, and listen, I'm sure you know this whole routine
Leave your name and number
And I'll try and get back to you
You have thirty seconds to talk to me before you're threw

And she said, "Baby I got your message. 
Well I'm answering your call.  
I have thought it out, I have thought it out
and I think that all in all
If you ask if we can marry, and make it for all time
then my answer is..."
 and the phone went


I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine
I'm not in, and listen, I'm sure you know this whole routine
I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine
I'm not in, and listen, I'm sure you know this whole routine
I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine
I'm not in, and listen, I'm sure you know this whole routine
