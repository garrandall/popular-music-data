Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby, they're tumbling down
They didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's a risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
I pray it won't fade away

(Halo, halo, halo)
I can feel your halo (halo), halo (halo), halo

You hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't begin
To pull me back to the ground again

Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's a risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

(Halo, halo)
(I can see your halo, halo)
Halo
(I can feel your halo, halo)
Halo
(I can see your halo)

(Everything you need and more)
You're everything
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
I pray it won't fade away

(Everything you need and more)
Fade away
(It's written all over your face)
Fade away
(Baby, I can feel your halo)
(You know you're my saving grace)
Halo
(I can feel your)
Halo
(Halo)
(I can feel your halo)
Halo
(I can see your halo)
Halo
