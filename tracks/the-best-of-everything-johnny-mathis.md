We've proven romance is still
The best of everything
That sudden thrill
The best of everything

That one little sigh is treasure
You cannot buy or measure
By any test
The best of everything

You found the moon and the sun
Yes, he is the one, it seems
But soon it's done
And not the fun it seems

You walk through the night just groping
It's still alright, you're hoping
Love can be all or nothing
But even when its nothing

It's still the best
The best of everything
We've proven romance is still
The best of everything
