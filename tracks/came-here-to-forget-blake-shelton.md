Girl you're getting over him and I'm getting over her
The eyes have it made, ain't gotta say a word
Misery loves company, that's why it's you and me
Buying each other drinks, back at the bar, as thick as thieves
Stealing these little sips
Doing our best to make the best of the worst of it

Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her
And with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember
Can't remember what we came here to forget

Go ahead and check your phone, like I've been checking mine
Nobody's ex texting for a rewind
Looks like it's just me and you
Fall in love just enough to get us through
What we're getting through

Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her
And with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember
Can't remember what we came here to forget
Ya, it's what we came here to forget

Looks like it's just me and you
Fall in love just enough to get us through
What we're getting through

Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her
And with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember
Can't remember what we came here to forget

What we came here to forget
What we came here to forget
Baby, baby
That's what we came here to forget
