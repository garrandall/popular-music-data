Hm, well I got a woman mean as she can be
Well I got a woman mean as she can be
Some-a-times I think she's almost mean as me

She gotta ruby lips, she got shapely hips, yeah
Boy she makes ole Roy-oy flip
I got a woman mean as she can be
Some-a-times I think she's almost mean as me

Well I ain't braggin', it's understood
Everything I do, well I sure do it good
Yeah I got a woman mean as she can be
Some-a-times I think she's almost mean as me
Well!

She gotta ruby lips, she got shapely hips, yeah
Boy she makes ole Roy-oy flip
I got a woman mean as she can be
Some-a-times I think she's almost mean as me, easy now

Ah-huh-huh-huh

Now let's go one time

Well I got a woman (sha la la la)
Yeah I got a woman (sha la la la)
Yeah I got a woman (sha la la la)
Well I got a woman (sha la la la)
Some-a-times I think she's almost mean as me
