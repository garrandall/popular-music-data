Well, she never sees it comin'
She never sees it goin'
She lacks a certain point of view
But something always pulls her through
What she tries

It's a weapon deep inside
No mortal could have contrived
Suzi's found a weapon
And I don't even think she tried

Well, you dress her up with passion
She wears you like a fashion
That changes with the style of clothes
But passion sticks inside your throat
Like a knife

You thought you'd found the perfect rose
You cut the stem but it still grows
Suzi's found a weapon
And I don't even think she knows

So if she catches your eye
God help you
You'll have to run and die
Not to love her

Suzi found a weapon
And I don't even think she knows

Well, she never sees it comin'
She never sees it going
She lacks a certain point of view
But something always pulls her through
What she tries

It's a weapon deep inside
No mortal could have contrived
Suzi's found a weapon
And I don't even think she tried

So if she catches your eye
God help you
You'll have to run and die
Not to love her

Suzi found a weapon
And I don't even think she knows
Yeah, Suzi found a weapon
And I don't even think she tried
Yeah, Suzi found a weapon
And I don't even think she tried
Mmm, Suzi found a weapon
And I don't even think she tried
