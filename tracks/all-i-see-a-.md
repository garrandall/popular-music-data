Boy, all I see is you and me
And all I do is think of you


Yo, I remember when we met the whole scene was set
Backstage rockin' black shades
Told you not to be afraid
We touched, then your smile turned to a blush
I had to get to know your name
Then I got your number

Seventeen and under
Maybe just a little younger
Had to get to know cause there's things I got to show you
Forget them other brothers
They know lines that they told you
Now you're acting all shy
Hm, I wonder why
Everytime I look at you
You turn and drop your eye

We faced
Began to lace you up with lines
Fragrance by Ann Klein had me losing my mind
With your zodiac sign
My perfect match in fact
I'm compatable with anything from Mio to Ash
Now it's all about us cause we're hooked like drugs
I'm on my way to being a thug
Show me love


Boy, all I see is you and me
And all I do is think of you
Give me the chance to know your name
I'll never turn and walk away


I can't get you out of my mind
I'd be lying
If I said I wasn't hooked after just one look
Yeah, see you at the mall with your mom looking all flashy
Poppin' out of a taxi
Met eyes when you passed me
Been inside of my head all day

What can I say?
All I can do is reminicse like Mary J
I want to get with you
So come and get with me
We'll be K-I-S-S-I-N-G
And all that good stuff
Calling you bluff, now look at us
Just met and already talking 'bout trust
All the things we did
How we planned to live
How you got rid of that kid who use to call you crib

Shut it down
Now look what you found state of dawn
You da bomb
Plus you got props from my mom
Now it's all about us cause we're hooked like drugs
I'm on my way to being a thug
Show me love

I can't get you out of my mind
Think about you all of the time
Got to get to know you, babe
Baby, oh...


I'm glad I made my move
I'm glad I stepped to you
Enough respect that my whole crew excepted you
Even my ex called you

She wasn't insecure
Feeling she got a little hurt
But was being mature
Gave her blessing
She learned a valuable lesson
Now she's my best friend
Don't even stress

'Cause all I see is you and me
Like Latifah
You're queen
Let's bring some unity

Ain't no reason to fight
You know we're always keeping it tight
Whether walking or holding hands or sharing seats on the bike
Always on my mind with your Gucci design
Feel free to drop a line
Yeah, that would suit me fine

It's all about you, boo
And all the things you do
Making dreams come true
Buying rings for two
Now it's all about us cause we're hooked like drugs
I'm on my way to being a thug
Show me love


Boy, all I see is you and me
And all I do is think of you
Give me the chance to know your name
I'll never turn and walk away

Boy. all I need is you and me
And all I do is think of you
Give me the chance to know your name
I'll never turn and walk away
