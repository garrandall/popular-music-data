I was feeling so alone today
Watching lovers as they passed my way
I could almost feel the love in the air
And I thought is it there for me
Then a friendly little butterfly
Flew around me 'til he caught my eye
He was careful so that no one could hear
As he whispered in my ear

Go chase a moonbeam across a meadow
And wrap a rainbow around your heart
Then find a bluebird to sing a love song
And Mother Nature will do her part

So I listened to the butterfly
And when I gave his advice a try
Why, it wasn't very long 'til I found
There was love all around for me
Now if you are all alone some day
Watching happy lovers pass your way
Just remember what he told me to do
And the same thing applies to you

Go chase a moonbeam across a meadow
And wrap a rainbow around your heart
Then find a bluebird to sing a love song
And Mother Nature will do her part
And Mother Nature will do her part
