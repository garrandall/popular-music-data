All through my wandering years
I always said
I was biding my time
All alone in the dark
I'd faced my fears
That no other heart would come to mine

At first when you found me
It took me a while
'til I realised
Why I felt weak
When you were around
Why I couldn't speak
When I looked in your eyes

All this time
I've been searching
Until you, I was lost in my dreams
And I never knew that love
Could feel like heaven
Watching over me

Wherever you are
Invisible hands reach over the miles
For every wish
You make to the stars
There's one silent kiss
I send to the sky

All this time
I've been searching
Until you I was lost in my dreams
And I  never knew that love could feel like heaven
Watching over me

Everything's changed
Since you came my way
(Since you came my way)
You put the colour
In a world of grey
And you make the love
That carries me away

All this time
I've been searching
Until you
I was lost in my dreams
And I never knew that love could
Feel like heaven
Watching over me
You know that it feels like heaven
Watching over me

Watching over me

Feels like heaven
