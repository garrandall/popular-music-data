I'm sure it might have grown old
Like most young things usually do
and dangling a line to try and find your mind
For that I can't blame you.

Now I'm not questioning your motives
For all the silly things you've done
Now you're coming round putting yourself down
Telling me I always was the one

It sure took a long time to miss me
A long time for you to come around
A long time to find what was wrong
It sure took a long, long time.

The magic that we had together
Seems so much stronger than before
What did I learn to make the love return
O girl I've got to learn some more.
