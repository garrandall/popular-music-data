Beasta!

Do your chain hang low
Do it wobble to the flo'
Do it shine in the light
Is it platinum, Is it gold
Could you throw it over ya shoulda
If ya hot, it make ya cold
Do your chain hang low



Is that your chain!?
Bout 24 inches is how low I let it hang
Hop out the ride n let the diamonds smoke off the range
Just by the chain you can tell the big kid do his thang
You know the name!

Is that your chain!?
Bout 24 inches is how low I let it hang
Hop out the ride n let the diamonds smoke off the range
Just by the chain you can tell the big kid do his thang
I'm off the chain!


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm hot kid
Chains so low you would think that diamonds never stop it
And it's funny cause you could never stop it
A bunch of rocks on my hand n I ain't even on the block yet
Show em white gold sorta hold em like my tims
And a chain hang 24 inches like the rims
Diamonds all blown up yeah sorta like a pimp
So when I like hit the ice
It starts glistening off the tims (off the tims)

My chain hang
All it do is blang blang
Half blue, half red
Like my diamonds gang bang
And don't even think
We on the same thing
Charms so heavy they couldn't lift it till the crane came


Do your chain hang low
Do it wobble to the flo'
Do it shine in the light
Is it platinum, Is it gold
Could you throw it over ya shoulda
If ya hot, it make ya cold
Do your chain hang low

Do your chain hang low
Do it wobble to the flo'
Do it shine in the light
Is it platinum, is it gold?
Could you throw it over ya shoulda?
If ya hot, it make ya cold
Do your chain hang low


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm so icy (do yo chain)
My trunk so heavy that my neck don't like me (do yo chain)
Go n no no no is not a game kid (do yo chain)
Cause I throw my chain in the crowd (do do do do do do yo chain)
Like game B

Is nothing
Diamonds is nothing to me
(do yo chain) Especially when I'm dressing up
It's just a button to me
Bling! (could you throw it over yo shoulda) and not to mention my teeth
Cause they color coordinated
Complimenting the teeth
Oh bra (boy) dats!

So check out my swag
Diamonds red, white, n blue like the American flag
Boy (do yo chain) is so colorful
N see I got that nice screen
My money spend on jewels
I call it my ice cream (chain, chain, chain, chain)

My music give you black eye
Cuz of the beating
They think I am a mutant
The way a boy is beasting (chain, chain, chain, chain)
I stay when n sometime you call it cheating
Yeah, my boys always around
Like it's a mee-ting

Is that your (do yo chain) chain!?
Bout 24 inches is how low I let it hang (do yo chain)
Hop out the ride n let the diamonds smoke off the range (do yo chain)
Just by the chain you can tell the big kid do his thang (do yo chain)
You know the name! (do do do do do do yo chain)

Is that your chain!?
Bout 24 inches is how low I let it hang (do yo chain)
Hop out the ride n let the diamonds smoke off the range (do yo chain)
Just by the chain you can tell the big kid do his thang (do yo chain)
I'm off the chain! (do do do do do do yo chain)

Do your chain hang low
Do it wobble to the flo'
Do it shine in the light
Is it platinum, Is it gold
Could you throw it over ya shoulda
If ya hot, it make ya cold
Do your chain hang low

Do your chain hang low
Do it wobble to the flo'
Do it shine in the light
Is it platinum, Is it gold
Could you throw it over ya shoulda
If ya hot, it make ya cold
Do your chain hang low
