If I say I love ya
And lay it on the line
Yeah
Could you say you need me
And put your hands in mine

Oh I got love that grows
Oh I got love that shows
I got the love
If you've got the time
Then I've got the time

Do you say you want me
You'll give me everything
Then you could come live here
I'd even buy a ring

Oh I've got lots to learn
Oh I've got love to burn
I got the love
If you've got the time

Oh I've got love that shows
Oh I've got love that grows
I got the love
If you've got the time
Then I've got the time
Yeah

Do you say you need me
You'll give me everything
Then you could come live here
I'd even buy a ring

Oh I've got love that shows
Oh I've got love that grows
I got the love
If you've got the time
Then I've got the time

Oh I've got love that shows
Oh I've got love that grows
I got the love
If you've got the time
Then I've got the time

Oh I've got love that shows
Oh I've got love that grows
I've got the love
