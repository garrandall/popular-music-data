Ying to the Yang
Up in this thang
D to da roc
My Nigga Kaine
Open it cut
Pouring it up
Rolling it up
Holing it up
Ain't her ass swollen or what?
Yes sir yes sir
Oh we gonna take it back like thieves and foes
Nasty as I wanna be
That must be 2 live for your crew
Hoe get down get low
I'm crossing these mammas like tic tac toe
Let's ride lets go
Get loose get crunk get drunk get blown
That's right lets roll
MIA ATL fo sho

That little momma is known around the world
Shake that ass if u a nasty girl
Back that ass up says juvenile
Show a nigga some tities like girls gone wild
Tear off this clip of clothes, I wanna see u in the nude
You can keep on your high heel shoes
So follow me down to yellow brick road
Where niggas go to see naked hoes
Shake that shit bitch
And be off in the club with a hard ass dick
Then drop like this bitch
If you wanna make the money shawty work that shit
Put a hump in your back
And lick it raw
To a 3 point stance
But u mess up yo ass
You must be on that Kanye work out plan
Like head shoulder knees hoes

Take em out in cruise
Take em out all dressed
Is the realest true niggas in the ATL
Yeah we break it down betta shake a booty hoe
And them hoes and the girl with the real tight clothe
One time for the gang with the Ying Yang Twins
We already know we off the reel
Don't tolerate that talking
Bitch u can get to walking
Patron is where I'm gwaking
The only way that we gon' talk
If your breath smells like mine
Girl don't give a fuck 'cause u fine
I miss 'em fo I kiss em
I pack 'em fo I stack em
So while we in the club betta get these girls
Cause on the streets there ain't no action
