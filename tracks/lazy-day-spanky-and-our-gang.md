Blue sky, sunshine
What a day to take a walk in the park
Ice cream, daydream
Till the sky becomes a blanket of stars
What a day for pickin' daisies
And lots of red balloons
And what a day for holdin' hands
And bein' with you

Lazy day just right for lovin' away
Lazy day made for a-strollin' the lane
Baby you and me
(You and me)
And a honey bee
'Neath a shady tree
Lazy day, lazy day
Lazy day for you and me

Blue sky, sunshine
Flowers bloomin', children sayin' hello
Rowboats, bird notes
People smilin' everywhere that we go
What a day to be together
And what a sky of blue
And what a day for thinkin' right out loud
I love you

Lazy day just right for lovin' away
Lazy day made for a-strollin' the lane
Baby you and me
(You and me)
And a honey bee
'Neath a shady tree
Lazy day, lazy day
Lazy day for you and me

What a day for pickin' daisies
And lots of red balloons
And what a day for thinkin' right out loud
I love you

Lazy day just right for lovin' away
Lazy day made for a-strollin' the lane
Lazy day just right for lovin' away
Lazy day
