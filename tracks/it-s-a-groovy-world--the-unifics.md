This is a groovy world we live in
And everybody must know
People are gonna be people
No matter where you go
So forget the black, the white, the rich, the poor
The right and the wrong
Let everybody be everybody
So we can all get along
You don't have to try to force me
To dig my fellow man
Let me do my thing
You do yours
Things will be just fair
There's so much mistrust enough
Not to do each other wrong
So let's concentrate on getting rid of hate
So that we can make it a groovy world

Can't teach an old dog new tricks
So the saying goes
The old folks don't understand you youngsters
And they claim you just ain't grown
But if we took the time to explain
And give old folks a chance
You might be surprised
They might change their mind
And begin to understand

To each his own and know thyself
Another saying goes
Different strokes, different folks
Is the one you probably know
Don't ever take a trip to be hip
To feel what life can be
I can dig here, you can dig me
The world will be such a groovy place to be

Seems its up to you and me
To hold this world together
Pool our resources
Collect our cool
To help make things better
Claim today we're tomorrow leaders
So why don't we all take heed
Set and example for the world to follow
To know just what it needs

See a flower child walking hand-in-hand
With a military man
And know that peace instead of war
Prevails in our land
To know today that people made
From all across the globe
Join hands brother like we should
Let's make it a groovy world
