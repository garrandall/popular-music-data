There she goes
There she goes again
Racing through my brain


And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains


There she goes
There she goes again
Pulsing through my vein


And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains


There she goes
There she goes again
She calls my name, pulls my train
No one else could heal my pain


And I just can't contain
This feelin' that remains


There she goes
There she goes again
Chasing down my lane


And I just can't contain
This feelin' that remains


There she goes
There she goes again
There she goes
There she goes again
There she goes
There she goes again
