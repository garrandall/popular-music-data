Girl I know this might seem strange
But let me know if I'm out of order
For stepping to you this way
See I've been watching you for a while
And I just gotta let you know
That I'm really feeling your style
Cause I have to know your name
And leave you with my number
And I hope that you would call me someday
If you want you can give me yours too
And if you don't well I ain't mad at you
We can still be cool 'cause


I'm not trying to pressure you just can't stop thinking 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my girlfriend
I just wanna know your name and maybe some time
We can hook up, hang out, just chill


Damn, I'm surprised that you called
'Cause the way you walked away
I thought I wasn't gon' see you no more
Since you didn't wanna give me your name
I thought that you were igging me
And wasn't digging me
But anyway what you doing tonight?
I'll probably be with my peeps
If it's cool with you maybe well swing by
And you can just chill with us or you can just chill with me
Long as you're comfortable
And you feel secure when your with me cause


I'm not trying to pressure you just can't stop thinking 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my girlfriend
I just wanna know your name and maybe some time
We can hook up, hang out, just chill


Oh, oh, baby, yeah maybe we can
Go and see a movie girl
Or maybe we can hang out girl whatever you wanna do
Just let me know, it's up to you
I'm not trying to pressure you just can't stop thinking 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my girlfriend
I just wanna know your name and maybe some time
We can hook up, hang out, just chill


I'm not trying to pressure you just can't stop thinking 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my girlfriend
I just wanna know your name and maybe some time
We can hook up, hang out, just chill


I'm not trying to pressure you just can't stop thinking 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my girlfriend
I just wanna know your name and maybe some time
We can hook up, hang out, just chill


Just trying to keep it real
Ain't out to get nothing from you, oh no, oh no
We can just talk about you girl
Oh yeah
I'm just there for you any time you need me to be
