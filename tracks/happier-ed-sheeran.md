She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed on the neck and then I took her by the hand
I said, baby, I just want to dance



I lost my shoes last night
I don't know where I put my keys
Bibia be ye ye



We can change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat, way we go



Baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
But until then I'll smile and hide the truth
'Cause I know I was happier with you



She and I went on the run
Don't care 'bout religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan, and I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border



I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
I'm in love with your body
I'm in love with your...
I'm in love with your body



Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go and when God takes you back
He'll say Hallelujah you're home



I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be calling me up tryna
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missing all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
