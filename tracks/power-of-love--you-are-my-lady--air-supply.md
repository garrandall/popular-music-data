The whispers in the morning
Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now
As I look in your eyes

I hold on to your body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

Cause you are my lady
And I am your man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

Lost is how I'm feeling
Lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you

Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
Cause I am always by your side

Cause you are my lady
And I am your man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
'Bout the power of love

The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear suddenly
The feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
'Bout the power of love

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
'Bout the power of love

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
'Bout the power of love
