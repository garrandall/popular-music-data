After all we've been
To one another
How can we become
Like sister and brother
Darling I beg of you
If our love must end
Ask me to forget you
But don't ask me to be friends

After being the one
That you took pride in
I just couldn't be
The friend you'd confide in
If it's goodbye for us
We'll never meet again
Ask me to forget you
But don't ask me to be friends

Wanting you so badly
Needing you like this
How can I just look at
The lips that I used to kiss

If there's someone else
Don't let me see him
â€˜Cause I'll spend my life
Wishing I could be him
Darling I beg of you
If our love must end
Ask me to forget you
But don't ask me to be friends
