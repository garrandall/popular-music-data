When you feel your heart's guarded
And you see the break's started
And when the clouds have all departed
You'll be right here with me


B-Tock
Darkchild
We back
You'll be right here with me

You'll be right here with me
You'll be right here with me

When your life is going too fast
Off the train tracks
I can slow it down
Just when you think you're 'bout to turn back
Scared you might crash
I'll be your ground

When you feel your heart's guarded
And you see the break's started
And when the clouds above departed
You'll be right here with me

When your tears have dried from crying
And when the world has turned silent
So when the clouds above departed
You will be right here with me

I will be right here with you
You'll be right here with me
I will be right here with you
You'll be right here with me

When you're trapped and there's just no key
And you can't breathe
I breathe for you
The fire's got you down on both knees
And the walls are closing in but I ll be breaking through
And when you feel alone
I'mma be your home
When others come and go
You know I got you

When you feel your heart's guarded
And you see the break's started
When the clouds above departed
You'll be right here with me
(You'll see the sun)

When your tears have dried from crying, crying
And the world has turned to silent, silent
When the clouds above departed
You will be right here with me

I will be here right beside you
Every step you take
I will be your strength your shelter
Shield you from the rain

When you feel
When you feel your heart's guarded
And you see the break's started
And when the clouds above departed
You'll be right here with me (right here)

When your tears have dried from crying
And the world has turned to silent
So when the clouds above departed
You will be right here with me

When you feel your heart's guarded
And you see the break's started
And when the clouds above departed
You'll be right here with me

When your tears have dried from crying
And the world has turned to silent
So when the clouds above departed
You will be right here with me

I will be right here with you
You'll be right here with me
I will be right here with you
You'll be right here with me
I will be right here with you
You'll be right here with me
I will be right here with you
You'll be right here with me
