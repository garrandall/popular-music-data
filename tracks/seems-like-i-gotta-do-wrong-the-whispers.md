Another day has come and gone
In a world where I don't belong
Another week has passed me by
It's not because I didn't try

Nobody saw me walking
And nobody heard me talking
Seems like I gotta do wrong
Gotta do wrong, gotta do wrong
Before they notice me

Another job that I just can't get
A nice apartment, the landlord jut won't rent
I go to bed, but my sleep just won't come
My belly's empty and my brain is numb

Nobody saw me walking
And nobody heard me talking
Seems like I gotta do wrong
Gotta do wrong, gotta do wrong
Before they notice me

Seems like I gotta do wrong
Before they notice me

Oh oh oohohohh,oh, ohoh
Oh oh oohohohh,oh, ohoh

I go to bed, but my sleep just won't come
My belly's empty and my brain is numb

Nobody saw me walking
And nobody heard me talking
Seems like I gotta do wrong
Gotta do wrong, gotta do wrong
Before they notice me

Yes, I do, oh, yeah
Seems like I gotta do wrong
Gotta do wrong, gotta do wrong
Before they notice me
