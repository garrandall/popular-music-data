Another day has come and gone
In a world where I don't belong
Another week has passed me by
And it's not because I didn't try

I keep on trying but nobody saw me walking
Nobody heard me talking
I don't know why
I gotta do wrong, gotta do wrong, gotta do wrong
Before they notice me

Another job I can not get
A nice apartment the landlord will not rent
I go to bed but sleep won't come
My body's aching and my soul feels numb

Nobody saw me walking
Nobody heard me talking
Tell me why
I gotta do wrong, gotta do wrong, gotta do wrong
Before they notice me

I'm just a number and not a name
Well, if I'm crazy tell me, who's to blame

No not me, nobody saw me walking
Nobody heard me talking
I believe
I gotta do wrong, gotta do wrong, gotta do wrong
Before they notice me
...
