People try to rape me
Always think I'm crazy
Make me burn the candle right down
Baby I can't stay
I don't need your jewels in my frown

Now all you women are low-down gamblers
Cheating like I don't know how
Baby I go crazy
There's fever in the funkhouse now

Well this low-down bitching
Got my poor feet a-itching
Can't you see the deuce is still wild
Baby get it straight
You got to roll me
And call me the tumbling dice

Always in a hurry
Never stop to worry
Can't see the time passing by
Honey got no money
I'm sixes and sevens and nines

Well hey now baby I'm the rank outsider
You can be my partner in crime
Baby get it straight
You got to roll me
Call me the tumbling dice

I said my my my
I'm the lone crapshooter
Playing the field every night
Baby get it straight
You got to roll me
Call me the tumbling dice

You got to roll me
Babe you got to roll me
Babe you got to roll me
Oh oh oh you got to roll me
Woo hoo hoo you got to roll me
Woah babe you got to roll me
Baby babe you got to roll me
