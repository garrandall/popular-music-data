I was all right for a while
I could smile for a while
But I saw you last night
You held my hand so tight
As you stopped to say "Hello"
Ah you wished me well
You couldn't tell

That I've been cryin' over you
Cryin' over you
Then you said "So long"
Left me standin' all alone
Alone and cryin' (cryin')
Cryin' (cryin'), cryin' (cryin'), cryin'
It's hard to understand
That the touch of your hand
Can start me cryin'

I thought that I was over you
But it's true, so true
I love you even more than I did before
But darlin' what can I do
You don't love me and I'll always be

Cryin' over you, cryin' over you
Yes, now you're gone
And from this moment on
I'll be cryin' (cryin')
Cryin' (cryin'), cryin' (cryin'), cryin'
I'm cryin', cryin' over you
