Up a lazy river
By the old mill run
Lazy river
In the noonday sun

Linger awhile
In the shade of a tree
Throw away your troubles
Dream with me

Up a lazy river
Where the robin's song
Wakes the mornin' we roll along
May be blue skies above
Everyone's in love
Up a lazy river
How happy we'll be
Up a lazy river with me

Up a lazy river
By the old mill run
That lazy, lazy river
In the noonday sun

You can linger for awhile
In the shade of a tree
Throw away your troubles, baby
Dream a dream of me

Up a lazy river
Where the robin's song
Wakes a bright new mornin'
Where we can roll along

There may be blue skies up above
But, as long as we're in love
Yeah... we'll be up a lazy river
How happy we could be
Up a lazy river with me

From the halfway mark

Yeah... up a lazy river
Where that robin's song
Awakes a bright new mornin'
We can roll along

A-a-a... there are blue skies up above
And as long as we're in love
We'll be up a lazy river
Up a crazy, lazy river

Up a lazy river
I ain't goin' your way
Get outta my way
Up a lazy river with me
