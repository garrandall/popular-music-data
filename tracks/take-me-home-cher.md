Take me home, take me home
Want to feel you close to me
Take me home, take me home
With you is where I wanna be

Wrapped in your arms tonight
Just making love
Music and candlelight
Stars up above

Take me home, take me home
Oh, can't you see I want you near
Take me home, take me home
Ooh, baby, let's get out of here

I'd follow you anywhere
Your place or mine
Just a one night affair
Would be so fine

I'm in heaven
Seems like heaven
So much in heaven

(Take me home)
(Take me home)

One night with you
Lying here next to me
It's the right thing to do
It would be ecstasy

I'm in heaven
Seems like heaven
So much in heaven

Take me home, take me home
Want to feel you close to me
Take me home, take me home
With you is where I wanna be

Wrapped in your arms tonight
Just making love
Music and candlelight
Stars up above

I'm in heaven
Seems like heaven (Take me, take me home, home with you)
Ah can't you see I want you near
Baby, baby let's get out of here
(Take me, take me home, home with you)
