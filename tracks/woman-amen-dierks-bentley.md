Oh oh oh...

I'd lose my way and I'd lose my mind
If I faced one day on my own
I know I was saved
The night that she gave this drifter's heart a home

Every night I should be on my knees
Lord knows how lucky I am
I'll never say it near enough
Thank God for this woman, Amen

Oh oh oh...

This world has a way of shaking your faith
I've been broken again and again
But I need all the cracks in my shattered heart
'Cause that's where her love gets in

Every night I should be on my knees
Lord knows how lucky I am
I'll never say it near enough
Thank God for this woman, Amen

She gives me faith
She gives me grace
She gives me hope
She gives me strength
She gives me love
Love without end
Thank God for this woman, Amen

Sister, shoulder
Daughter, lover
Healer, broken halo
Mother nature
Fire, suit of armor
Soul survivor, holy water
Secret keeper, fortune teller
Virgin Mary, Scarlet letter
Technicolor river wild
Baby girl, woman child
Female

And I say thanks for the moon and the stars up above
Forgiveness' a sin in your undying love
Every twist every turn for the way you made sure
All my roads led to her

So tonight I will fall down on my knees
'Cause Lord knows how lucky I am
I'm gonna shout at the top of my lungs
Thank God for this woman, Amen
Yeah, thank God for this woman, Amen

She gives me faith
(Sister, shoulder, daughter, lover)
She gives me grace
(Healer, broken halo, mother)
She gives me hope
(Nature, fire, suit of armor)
She gives me strength
(Soul survivor, holy water)
She gives me love
(Secret keeper, fortune teller)
Love without end
(Virgin Mary, Scarlet letter)
Thank God for this woman, Amen
(Technicolor river wild
Baby girl, woman child)
Female
