Like a shot in the heart
Right into your soul
Is a kiss from our lips
Come on
You can get it all

Black kisses never make you blue
My sisters and me
We got some for you
Black kisses never make you blue
We give them for free
We give them to you

We say black, black kisses
Never make you blue, boy
Black, black kisses
Never make you blue, boy, no, no

Look at my big brown eyes
And my ebony skin
I can say I'm black
And I'm proud
No movie star
But a good looking woman
That's what I am
And I say it out loud

Yeah, there must be a boy
A special one
And I can say it
For the other girls too
When we meet them men
We know it's true
Black kisses never
Make you blue, boy oh no

Like a shot in the heart
Right into your soul
Is a kiss from our lips
Come on, you can get it all

Black kisses never make you blue
My sisters and me
We got some for you, we say
Black kisses never make you blue
We give them for free
We give them to you

We say black, black kisses
Never make you blue, boy
Oh, no, black, black kisses
Never make you blue, boy

Do you wanna take a chance?
I can see it on your face
Come on
Start it with a dance

Like a shot in the heart
(Like a shot in the heart)
Right into your soul
(Right into your soul)
Is a kiss from our lips
(Is a kiss from our lips)
Come on, you can get it all
(Come on, you can get it all)

Black kisses never make you blue
My sisters and me
We got some for you, we say
Black kisses never make you blue
We give them for free
We give them to you

Black, black kisses
Never make you blue, boy, no, no
Black, black kisses
Never make you blue, boy

Black, black kisses
(My sisters and me)
(We got some for you)
Black, black kisses
(We give them for free)
(We give them to you)

Like a shot in the heart
(Like a shot in the heart)
Right into your soul
(Right into your soul)
Is a kiss from our lips
(Is a kiss from our lips)
