You're on the couch,
Blowing up my phone
You don't want to come out,
But you don't want to be alone

It don't take but two
To have a little soirÃ©e
If you're in the mood
Sit tight right where you are, babe

'Cause I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Whatever you got on, girl, stay in it
You ain't gotta leave the house to have a good time
I'm 'a bring the good time home to you

We'll have a house party,
We don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boom-box out
We'll wake up all the neighbours
'Til the whole block hates us
And the cops show up and try to shut us down

If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party

Throw a neon tee shirt over the lamp shade
I'll take the furniture, slide it out of the way
Shaking the floor, rattling the roof
(roof's on fire)
We'll go to town like they're in your living room

Let's have a house party,
We don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boom-box out
We'll wake up all the neighbours
'Til the whole block hates us
And the cops show up and try to shut us down

If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party

So I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Whatever you got on, baby, stay in it
You ain't gotta leave the house to have a good time
I'm 'a bring the good time home to you

We'll have a house party,
We don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boom-box out
We'll wake up all the neighbours
'Til the whole block hates us
And the cops show up and try to shut us down

If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
