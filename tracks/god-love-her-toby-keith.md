Just a girl born in Dixie
Washed in the blood
And raised on the banks
Of the Mississippi mud
She always had a thing
About fallin' in love with a bad boy

Yea, they could see it all comin'
But her daddy never dreamed
She'd grow up that fast
You know what I mean
The way a girl gets
When she turns 17
Kinda crazy

She's a rebel child
And a preacher's daughter
She was baptized in dirty water
Her mama cried the first time
They caught her with me
They knew they couldn't stop her

She holds tight to me and the Bible
On the back seat of my motorcycle
Left her daddy standin' there
Preachin' to the choir
You see...God love her

Oh me and God love her

She kissed her mama goodbye
Said I'll be sure 'n phone ya
She called from a truck stop
In Tucson Arizona
With amazing grace
We made California alive
And then my gypsy life
Started takin' it's toll
And the fast lane got empty
And out of control
And just like an angel
She saved my soul from the devil

Yea she's a rebel child
And a preacher's daughter
She was baptized in dirty water
Her mama cried the first time
They caught her with me
They knew they couldn't stop her

She holds tight to me and the Bible
On the back seat of my motorcycle
Left her daddy standin' there
Preachin' to the choir
You see....God love her
Oh me and God love her

Now she holds tight to me and the Bible
On the back seat of my motorcycle
Left her daddy standin' there
Preachin' to the choir
You see...God love her
Oh me and God love her
God love her
Me and God love her
