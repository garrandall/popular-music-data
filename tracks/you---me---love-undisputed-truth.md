Drinkin' on Texas, parkin' lot flexin'
Bumpin' UGK, motherfucka
Ridin' dirty with the K, motherfucka
Underground AK, motherfucka
Drinkin' on Texas, parkin' lot flexin'
Bumping UGK, motherfucka
Eatin on shrimps, motherfucka
Long live the pimp, motherfucka


Sippin' on Port Arthur, hangin' with you rocks
Bad yellow bitch and her pussy taste like water
Cash red Cadillac, deuce and a quarter
Bumpin uncle pimp, and my uncle Bun
Niggas can't touch me like I'm Jay Prince son
Water drippin' off me, shinin' like a star
Grippin' on the wheel, Johnny Dale got me chilled
Texas in my Sprite when I'm poppin' seal
Drinkin' on mud, rockin' with the thugs
Long live Chad, the dirty south love you
I've come to get tippy, smokin', reminiscin'
Underground king, you a legend in my memory




Tippin' on glass slippaz, pain on and deep as fuck
UFC in my trunk, bet this gon' beat you up
Everything movin' slow, still ain't no keepin' low
Gator replace the seats, get your ass even up
Chopper behind the seat, truth still undisputed
Verse ain't the tryna trill, I won't talk with it because Suzanne
Hang in on the diamonds, flexing
Swinging over like I'm flexing
Stuntin' on 'em like I'm birdman
Make seven on it, whip the wrist
Nothing on it, don't fetch attention
Get your bitches, cold efficient
Gonna kill it on competitions
Sideline 'em, on suspension
Young Bill, turned to stone
Lil' Jim, Sweet Jane's Joe
Bumpin' UGK and get your stomach full of stones
