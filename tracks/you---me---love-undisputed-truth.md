Boy, the look of love
Is in my eyes
Won't you come a little closer
Boy, don't be shy

Boy, I know you need to roam
We've got it better, now that she's gone
We're both sitting here all alone
When we oughta be getting it on

(You plus me)
Oh, tell about it, y'all
(Equals loving, honey)

Oh, oh
(you plus me)
You plus me
(Equals loving, honey)

I can feel it in my bones
Love, between me and you strong
Boy, it's time that you realized
Without love, you just can't relax
Open your eyes

Boy, I'm so in love with you
And I'll do what you want me to
Please let me turn your gray sky blue
'Cause that's what I'm gonna do, baby

(You plus me)
Oh
(Equals loving, honey)
Sure sounds good to me

(You plus me)
Oh, you plus me
(Equals loving, honey)
And it's guaranteed

Give me your love
(Give me your love)
Oh, give it to me right now
(Give it to me right now)
Oh

Give it to me, give it to me

Locking up your heart
(Locking up your heart)
And you've thrown away the key
Let me tell you, sweet baby
That ain't no way to treat me
Can't you see?

Boy, I'm so in love with you
And I'll do what you want me to
I'm gonna try never make you blue
That's what I'm gonna, gonna do, baby

(You plus me)
Boy, you plus me
(Equals loving, honey)
Listen to me, boy

(You plus me)
Oh, you plus me
(Equals loving, honey)
And it's guaranteed
(Guaranteed)
Baby

Give it to me
(Give it to me)

Oh, locking up your heart
(Locking up your heart)
And you've thrown away the key
Let me tell you, sweet baby
That ain't no way to treat me

Can't you see
I'm so in love with you
I'm gonna do what you want me to
Let me turn your gray skies blue, oh
