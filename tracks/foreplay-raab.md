Girl take my hand it will lead to romance Please don't you worry girl I will please you
I won't tease you because I'll do anything for you
Come on baby why want you play with me Come inside open wide please baby
There is something that I want to do to you uh huh
Here's the honey & some whip cream come on baby let me do my thing
Foreplay
Just come along & play with me for a day if the love is good you know it should be you & me
I see your lovely body laying there don't move
