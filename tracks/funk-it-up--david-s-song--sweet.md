David was dancin'
With Charly standing in line in the wings
And yesterday's rain turns to snow

Shake your head now, honey child
Shake your head now, honey child
Jump back while I clean 'em up
Shake your head now, honey child

Spotlights are blinding
Like stars shooting down on the man
Who fell to earth
Spiralling up to the sky

Shake your head now, honey child
Shake your head now, honey child
Jump back while I clean 'em up
Shake your head now, honey child

Shake that head, shake that head
Shake my head, shake my head
Clean up the line, clean up the line
Clean up the line, clean up the line

Funk it up, funk it up
Funk it up, funk it up
Bring out the back, light up the front

Shake your head now, honey child
Shake your head now, honey child
Jump back while I clean 'em up
Shake your head now, honey child
