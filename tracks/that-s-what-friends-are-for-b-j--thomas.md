I been rocked to sleep many a night
To the tune of "what a friend"; come morning,
"rock of ages would waken me gently once again.
Then dad, he'd reach up and take the bible down
And read it, read it loud and long.
I always thought that maybe our home was blest
When daddy would say, "mama, sing a song."

Sister left home first, I guess,
Then bob and then Tommy and then Dan.
Then dad's hair was turnin' white
'n I had to be mama's little man.
But it seemed that as daddy's back growed weak,
Mother's faith just growed strong.
And them were the greatest days of all, when mama sang a song.

(rock of ages, cleft for
Me.
Let me hide myself in thee.)
Ooh ooh ooh 

I guess the house is still standing; I don't get back much no more.
No voice is left to fill them halls,
'n no steps to grace the floor.
You see, my mama sings in heaven now,
Around god's golden throne.
But I'll always believe this world
Is a better place because, one time, my mama, sang, a song.
