D'you see the face on the TV screen
Coming at you every Sunday?
See the face on the billboard?
Well that man is me
On the cover of a magazine
There's no question why I'm smiling
You buy a piece of paradise, you buy a piece of me


I'll get you everything you wanted
I'll get you everything you need
You don't need to believe in hereafter
Just believe in me


Cause Jesus, he knows me
And he knows I'm right
I've been talking to Jesus
All my life
Oh yes, he knows me
And he knows I'm right
Well, he's been telling me everything is alright


I believe in the family
With my ever-loving wife beside me
But she don't know about my girlfriend
Or the man I met last night
Do you believe in God?
Cause that is what I'm selling
And if you wanna get to heaven
Well, I'll see you right


You won't even have to leave your house
Or get out of your chair
You don't even have to touch that dial
Cause I'm everywhere


Jesus, he knows me
And he knows I'm right
I've been talking to Jesus
All my life
Oh yes, he knows me
And he knows I'm right
Well, he's been telling me everything's gonna be alright


Won't find me practicing what I'm preaching
Won't find me making no sacrifice
But I can get you a pocketful of miracles
If you promise to be good, try to be nice
God will take good care of you
Well, just do as I say, don't do as I do


Well, I'm counting my blessings
As I've found true happiness
Cause I'm a-getting richer
Day by day
You can find me in the phone book
Just call my toll-free number
You can do it any way you want
Just do it right away


And there'll be no doubt in your mind
You'll believe everything I'm saying
If you wanna get closer to Him
Get on your knees and start paying


Cause Jesus, he knows me
And he knows I'm right
I've been talking to Jesus
All my life
Oh yes, he knows me
And he knows I'm right
Well, he's been telling me everything's gonna be alright

Cause Jesus, he knows me
And he knows I'm right
Jesus, he knows, he knows
Oh, yes, he knows me
And he knows I'm right
Jesus, he knows, he knows
I've been talking to Jesus
All my life
Well, he's been telling me everything's gonna be alright
