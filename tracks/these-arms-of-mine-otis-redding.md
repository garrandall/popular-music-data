These arms of mine
They are lonely
Lonely and feeling blue
These arms of mine
They are yearning
Yearning from wanting you

And if you, would let them hold, hold you
Oh how grateful I will be

These arms of mine
They are burning
Burning from wanting you
These arms of mine
They are wanting
Wanting to hold you

And if you, would let them hold, hold, hold you
Oh how grateful I will be

These arms of mine
They are burning
Burning from wanting you
These arms of mine
They are wanting
Wanting to hold you

And if you would let them hold, hold you
Oh what a night it would be
Come on, come on now baby
I'll be your woman
Just be my lover
I need me somebody
Somebody to treat me right
Oh, I need your arms
Loving arms to hold me tight
I want to know if you want me, need me, love me, be mine tonight
