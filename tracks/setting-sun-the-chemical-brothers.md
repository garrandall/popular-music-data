You're the devil in me
I brought in from the cold
You said your body was young
But your mind was very old
You're coming on strong and I like the way
The visions we had have faded away
You're part of a life I've never had
I'll tell you that it's just too bad


I'll tell you that it's just too bad (X4)


You're coming on strong (X2)
You're showing your color
Like a setting sun
