There's no path to follow  
There's no path to follow  

There's a line in the sand  
Put there by a man  
By a man whose children who built the castles made of stone  

There's a man in the sky  
Giving reasons why  
That line grows deeper like these shackles round our bones  

Move on to my own  
Here come battle scars  
It's the final charge  
Here come battle scars  

There's a child born  
To a land of scorn  
Sneaks past the borders and the lords that hold his hand  

He was led like a lamb  
All part of the plan  
This castle crumbles as he walks out of this land  

Move on to my own  
Here come battle scars  
It's the final charge  
Here come battle scars  

This is what we own  
Here come battle scars  
This is where we are  
Here come battle scars  

There's no path to follow  
There's no path to follow  
There's no path to follow  

Living for the reasons  
of the dead that moved to  
paper from their heads  
into my fingers  
and my deadly view is  
strangled by the rent  
I have no purpose in this land  
have I forgotten how to stand up  
with the humor and the need  
I've got to find a way to be  

I just turn up the stereo  
I can't survive without the cold  
This culture's fallen off its feet  
I've got to find a brand new beat  

beat (beat) beat  
beat (beat) beat  
beat (beat) beat  

There's a road ahead  
'tween the live and dead  
Church bells are ringing like the panic in my head  

Step, step, one by one  
Walk into the setting sun  
Water's rising, rising fast  
History catching up at last  

Danger ahead, death behind  
No one to follow but old man time  

Time, time, take us back before the line was drawn  
Before the sky turned black.
