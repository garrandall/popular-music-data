Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo


I worked so hard to get me a man
Don't try to take him away
I love my man like nobody can
Don't try or you're gonna pay


You've been gettin' too close, you've been goin' too far
How do you think you are
Some kind of star


You're headin' for a red light
Hot night
Satisfy
Dynamite
Red light
Hot night
Satisfy
Dynamite
Red light (Red's the color)
Hot light (It's the fever I got)
Satisfy (Red enough it would burn you)
Oh
Red light (Red is all I can see)
Hot light (Hot is how it'll be)
Satisfy (Red for you if you mess with me)
Oh


Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo (Don't mess with me, now baby)
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo (You're gonna drive me crazy)
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo (Don't mess with me)
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo (Don't mess with me)
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo (You got that, you got that fever, oh, ho)
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo (You got that fever, ho, yeah)
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo


Red light (I'm talkin' 'bout a real red light)
Hot night (I'll give you such a hell of a fight, yeah)
Satisfy (Don't you try to take my man)
Dynamite (I wanna hold on long as I can, yeah)


Now I don't want you hangin' around
My man is too hard to hold
But if you plan on hangin' around
I plan on stoppin' you cold


'Cause I'm ready to rock and I'm ready to roll
I'm raging out of control
Look out below


You're headin' for a red light
Hot night
Satisfy
Dynamite
A red light
Hot night
Satisfy
Dynamite
Red light (My man)
Hot light (I wanna hold on just as long as I can, I said a red light)
Satisfy (A hot, hot night, baby, do it now)
Red light
Hot light
Satisfy


Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo (Don't mess with me, now baby)
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo (You're gonna drive me crazy)
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo (Don't mess with me)
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo (Don't mess with me)
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo (You got that, you got that fever, oh, ho)
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo (You got that fever, ho, yeah)
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
