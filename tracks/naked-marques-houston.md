Hey Lil mama let me holla in ya ear Tell you thangs that I know you wanna hear 
You wanna feel good then hear me here (So I can put it on you)
Even though I talk that talk
I swear to you I can walk that walk
You don't believe me then come to my house (So I can put it on you)
Yo top is hot and them jean is tight
But seein ya naked is a whole 'notha sight
I see ya smilin cuz u know i'm right
(Gurl I can put it on you)
Im mike Jones and I can't deny
I want ya bad and I can't even lie
So if you wanna moan and groan then hit up my phone (So I can put it on you)



Ain't neva been a man wantin anything as much as I want you (yea)
The sun don't come out til mornin so tonight there's no excuse
Just like the rain outside Ill make your love come down
So baby now it's time 
I just can't wait no more
Im gon give you what your body's been cryin for


And If I tell you yes lay me down,
Boy we ain't gotta rush just play around
We'll do it like we neva done before
So go and lock the door 
Baby don't worry just be gentle


Come on baby turn the lights off let's get naked (ooohh come on)
Come on baby girl you know I just can't take it (I can't take it no more)
Let ya panties hit the flo'
Let ya body steal the show right now (right now) 
It seems like ya ready 
So come on girl I just can't wait to see us naked (Butt naked yea)


I know you want this girl 
I see it in your eyes(yea)
Dont' be ashamed of what you got between those thighs 
Ya know Imma try not to be so excited
But I cant help it
Feels so good to be invited
So baby get ready cuz here I go 

Take off yo shoes (I wanna see them toes)
Slip off that skirt (and that shirts gotta go)
Pop off them draws (Girl you won't be needin those) 
Now you wearin what I like baby let's go




Now we at at the house and we all alone
Nobody but us know whats goin on
So lets fill the crib up wit candlelight 
Gotta do it right cuz toight's the night
Its goin down and I cant wait
Take away yo clothes 
Let me see yo shape
Don't know what ya heard but my sex is great
(Dont know what you heard but my sex is great)
I see that smile up on yo face
She on top of me and Im grabbin her waist
We switch positions Im layin her down
Seconds past and Im actin a clown
Im Mike Jones and I can't deny 
I want ya bad and I cany even lie so if you wanna moan and groan pick up ya phone 
(So I can put it on you)
