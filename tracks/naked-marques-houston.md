Shh
Don't say a word, just come over here
I got somethin' I gotta do tonight, listen


Ain't never been a man wantin' anything as much as I want you
The sun don't come up 'til morning so tonight there's no excuse (Mmm)
Just like the rain outside, I'll make your love come down
So, baby, now it's time
Just can't wait no more
I'm gon' give you what your body's been cryin' for


And if you tell me yes, I'll lay you down
Girl, we ain't gotta rush, let's play around
We'll do it like we never done before
So go and lock that door
Baby, don't worry 'cause I'll be gentle


Come on, baby, turn the lights off, let's get naked (Oh, come on)
Come on, baby girl, you know I just can't take it (I can't take it no more)
Let your panties hit the floor
Let your body steal the show right now
It seems like you're ready
So come on, girl, I just can't wait to see us naked
Us naked, yeah


I know you want this, girl, I see it in your eyes
Don't be ashamed of what you got between those thighs, oh
You know I'm gon' try not to be so excited (But I can't help it)
It feels so good to be invited
So, baby, get ready 'cause here I go (Here I go)
Oh, oh


So take off your shoes, I wanna see your toes
Slip off that skirt and that shirt's gotta go
Come out them drawers, girl, you won't be needin' those (Won't need 'em, babe)
Now you're wearing what I like, baby, let's go
Come on


Come on, baby, turn the lights off, let's get naked (Oh, come on)
Come on, baby girl, you know I just can't take it (I can't take it no more)
Let your panties hit the floor
Let your body steal the show right now (Right now)
It seems like you're ready
So come on, girl, I just can't wait to see us naked
Us naked, yeah


There's something 'bout that sexy skin your in
Your clothes don't do you justice, so come out of them
So baby take it off, so I can break you off
And give you love, love, love
Now its time to enjoy yourself
If you need assistance, baby girl, I'm here to help
'Cause it's time for us to start this love makin
But first, we gotta get butt naked


Damn girl (Hey)
Let's get naked
