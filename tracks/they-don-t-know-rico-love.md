DENCH
Y-Yeah the kid is back
You're all under attack
I was busy denching the world a dench-a-maniac
Some say a flippin' braniac
Y-Yeah go google that
Watch my Youtube vids you see I'm a insanichap
They call me everything under the sun
I didn't listen
Yeah I love a full belly, so I live in the kitchen
And you are what you eat, but I'm far from a chicken
Little mats, big ambition
Far from Dunham go emission
Now you listen yo
Started off as a little situation
Used to get myself in little altercations
Now and then go back to the MC old friends for a little bit of motivation
Some occasion look back on the journey
Its fascinating
Y-y-yeah Who thought in 2001 that Biz would still be here


Won't stop, can't stop, I had to get with it
If I didn't do me then I will not be living
Dumming all the pressures on my shoulders
I can do everything but I'm pushing down the boulders
Cause they got it wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong,wrong,wrong
Cause they got it wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong,wrong,wrong
Cause they got it wrong


You don't know history, I beg you pardon
I was on Rinse in the day with Carbon
DJ G on the decks you get me
I was on a set with Rico and Pepsi
DJ Target, DJ Trim, DJ slim with a mix and blend
Even I DJ too vinyl in the bag
Getting busy on the top ten's
I make history, it's not a mystery
I wouldn't miss my time, nor miss the P
And now my ear ting gone like Mr T
Told them I dont wanna hear a diss for me
They do it because they're missing me
And I know the game, they're tricking me
When I go back and check progress I see they ain't got shit for me



I-I-I-I a pop-star, rock star no
I am a pimp, I am a there
Student protest powers the soundtrack
Big Ben's garden, Cameron's scared
I am The Clash, I am The Beatles
Little bit of cannabis, don't take needles
I am volume, there ain't no mute
I am bananas, I ain't no fruit
I'm not Judy, but I am Dench
Don't Know German, little bit of French
Honestly I speak my mind
I ain't hiding behind no fence
Little bit unobtainable, yeah little bit inspirational
If you wanna do something do it yourself
Fear there is unexplainable

Cause they got it wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong
Cause they got it wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong
Cause they got it wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong
Cause they got it wrong
