The Sunday morning gospel goes good with the soul
There's blues, folk, and country, and rock like a rolling stone
The world could come together as one
If everybody under the sun


Add some music to your day
(Add some music add some add some music to your day)
A bob didit a bop didit


You'll hear it while you're walking by a neighbor's home
You'll hear it faintly in the distance when you're on the phone
You're sitting in a dentist's chair
And they've got music for you there




Add some music, music everywhere (add some music)
Add some, add some, add some, add some music (add some music)
Your doctor knows it keeps you calm
Your preacher adds it to his psalms




Music
(Add some music, add some music)
When you're alone
(Add some music, add some music)
Is like a companion
(Add some music, add some music)
For your lonely soul
Oo oo oo woo oo woo oo oo oo oooo


When day is over (when day is over)
I close my tired eyes (I close my tired)
Music is in my soul
At a movie you can feel it touching your heart
And on every day of the summertime
You'll hear children chasing ice cream carts
They'll play it on your wedding day
There must be about a million ways




Add some music to your day
