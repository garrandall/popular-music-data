(Yah!)
Now if you feel that you can't go on (can't go on)
Because all of your hope is gone (all your hope is gone)
And your life is filled with much confusion (much confusion)
Until happiness is just an illusion (happiness is just an illusion)
And your world around is crumbling down, darlin'


(Reach out) Come on, girl, reach on out for me
(Reach out) Reach out for me
Hah, I'll be there with a love that will shelter you
I'll be there with a love that will see you through


When you feel lost and about to give up (to give up)
'Cause your best just ain't good enough (just ain't good enough)
And you feel the world has grown cold (has grown cold)
And you're drifting out all on your own (drifting out on your own)
And you need a hand to hold, darlin'


(Reach out) Come on, girl, reach out for me
(Reach out) Reach out for me
Hah, I'll be there to love and comfort you
And I'll be there to cherish and care for you

(I'll be there to always see you through)
(I'll be there to love and comfort you)


I can tell the way you hang your head (hang your head)
You're not in love now, now you're afraid (you're afraid)
And through your tears you look around (look around)
But there's no peace of mind to be found (no peace of mind to be found)
I know what you're thinking - you're a loner, no love of your own
But darlin'


(Reach out) Come on, girl, reach out for me
(Reach out) reach out, just look over your shoulder
I'll be there to give you all the love you need
And I'll be there you can always depend on me
I'll be there
