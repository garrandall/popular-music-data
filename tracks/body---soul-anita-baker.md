Hm

What have you done to me
I can't eat, I cannot sleep
And I'm not the same anymore, no, no
I don't know what to do
'Cause all of me wants all of you
Do I stand alone at the shore

Now once I could turn away
From everything I feel today
But now I wanna walk through your door

But I've got to know, oh, body and soul
That you've got no doubt, inside and out
We are whole, ho, body and soul
Don't leave me out in the cold
Just love me body and soul

(Body and soul)
Do you hear me, baby

I've wasted too much time
Livin' for what wasn't mine
And then came the day I found you
And now I want nothing less
I've found a love that Is truly blessed
And I wanna make dreams come true

But I've got to know, oh, body and soul
That you've got no doubt, inside and out
We are whole, ho, body and soul
Don't leave me out in the cold
Just love me body and soul

Every day is getting better
The more I trust I feel stronger, stronger
Every kiss brings me closer
It feels good to let you inside

I've got to know, oh
Is there any doubt in your mind, oh, yeah
Oh, baby, ho, ho, body and soul)
Don't leave me out in this cold
Just love me body, hey, love

I've got to know, oh
It's your body baby, yeah... oh... oh... ho...
Is there any doubts in your mind
Tell me, baby, tell me, darlin', body and soul
Just let me love me
Just let me love me body and, and soul
Oh... oh... oh... oh... yes

Body and soul, soul
Body and soul, soul
Body and soul, soul
Body and soul, soul
Body and soul, soul
