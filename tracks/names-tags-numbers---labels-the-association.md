Names, I know a man
Who drowned his sorrows
In the cheapest booze
He knows he hasn't got
That much to lose, wino

Tags, she's twenty-five
She wants a family
And a house to run
Her sister always was
The pretty one, lonely


Names, tags, numbers, labels
Are the people telling you what you are
You believe them as a rule
While my name for you is beautiful
Your name for me is fool

Numbers, there's no escape cause
Time will do a number on us all
Your age is scrawled across
The office, old man



Labels, you gave me mine
At the time, I took it casually
Is that all you really thought of me
Loser
