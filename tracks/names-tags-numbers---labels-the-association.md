Names â I know a man
Who drowns his sorrows in the cheapest booze
He knows he hasn't got that much to lose
"Wino"

Tags â she's twenty-five
She wants a family and a house to run
Her sister always was the pretty one
"Lonely"

Names, tags, numbers, labels
All the people tell you what you are
You believe them as a rule
While my name for you is "beautiful"
Your name for me is "fool"

Numbers â there's no escape 'cos time will do a number on us all
Your age is scrawled across the office wall
"Old man" ("old man")

Names (names), tags (tags), numbers (numbers), labels
All the people tell you what you are
You believe them as a rule
While my name for you is "beautiful"
Your name for me is "fool"

Labels â you gave me mine
At the time I took it casually
Is that all you really thought of me?
"Loser" ("loser)

Names, tags, numbers, labels
All the people tell you what you are
You believe them as a rule
While my name for you is "beautiful"
Your name for me is "fool"
