Love has gone and I can't take it anymore
Seems you're actin' just like you don't love me anymore
But you know all I'll wanna see
Is your lovin' arms caressin' me
But you know that can never be

Don't pity me
Don't pity me

'Cause I can see you're goin' 'round with someone new
Reckon you have been with him a time or maybe two
But if you say you're goin' away
You're goin' away and away you'll stay
I'll want you back, but I won't take you back

Don't pity me
Don't pity me
Don't pity me

I want you to think that I'm alright
Think that I go to sleep at night
Oh, I know it's a lie
I know it's goodbye

Love has gone and I can't take it anymore
Seems you're actin' just like you don't love me anymore
But you know all I'll wanna see
Is your lovin' arms caressin' me
But you know that can never be

Don't pity me
Don't pity me
Don't pity me

I said don't pity me (Don't pity me)
Don't pity me
Oh please, don't pity me (Don't pity me)
Don't pity me
I said don't pity me (Don't pity me)
