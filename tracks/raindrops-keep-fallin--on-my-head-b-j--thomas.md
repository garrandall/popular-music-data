Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
I'm just like a man whose feet are too big for his bed
Nothin' seems to fit
(Too big, seems to fit)
Those raindrops keep fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'

So I did me some talkin' with the sun
And I said I didn't seem to like the way he got things done
Sleeping on the job
(Sleeping, sleeping)
Oh, those raindrops keep fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'

But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to greet me won't defeat me
(Defeat me)
And it won't be long for happiness steps up to greet me

Won't be long
Won't be long
Won't be long, yeah

'Cause raindrops keep fallin' on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
Crying's not for me
Oh but I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining

Because I'm free
(Free, free, free)
Oh-oh
(Free, free, free)
Oh-oh, I'm free
(Free, free, free)
Nothing's worrying me

(Raindrops keep fallin' on my head, they keep fallin')

Raindrops keep fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'
But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to greet me won't defeat me
(Defeat me)
And it won't be long for happiness steps up to greet me

(Won't be long)
(Won't be long)
(Won't be long)

Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
Crying's not for me
But I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining

Because I'm free
(Raindrops keep fallin', keep fallin', keep fallin')
Nothing's worrying me
(Raindrops keep fallin', keep fallin', keep fallin')
Oh-oh
(Raindrops keep fallin', keep fallin', keep fallin')
Nothing's worrying me
(Raindrops keep fallin', keep fallin', keep fallin')
Oh-oh, I'm free
(Raindrops keep fallin', keep fallin', keep fallin')
Nothing's worrying me
(Raindrops keep fallin', keep fallin', keep fallin')...
