You must be lost in a faraway land
I searched forever your footprints in the sand
I feel you need me, I have to answer
That desperate call that I do not understand

A burning bridge, a lonely highway
Another dark night thinking alone
What could've happened, am I just dreaming
It doesn't matter but there's one thing that I know

If I could make it to the border
If I could make it to the coast
If I could make it to the border
I'd be in the arms of the girl I love the most

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Make it to the border

So on and on I keep on running
To make the border before the light
Just one more river, then I can make it
Again you'll be in my arms tonight

If I could make it to the border
If I could make it to the coast
If I could make it to the border
I'd be in the arms of the girl I love the most

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Make it to the border
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Make it to the border

If I could make it to the border
If I could make it to the coast
If I could make it to the border
I'd be in the arms of the girl I love the most

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Make it to the border
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Make it to the border
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Make it to the border
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Make it to the border ...
