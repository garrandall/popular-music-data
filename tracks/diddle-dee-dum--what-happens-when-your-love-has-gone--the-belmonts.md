I wanna talk awhile, so gather round
I went to pick up my girl
This is what I found
She wasn't there and everyone said
She's gone with someone else instead

Diddle dee dum dum dum dum
Diddle dee dum dum dum dum

She's telling everyone we're through
Now I don't know what I'll do
I cried so much, my eyes are sore
I never felt like this before

What happens when your love has gone
What happens when dreams have ended
When all the time, you thought
Her love was true, what do you do

Diddle dee dum dum dum dum
Diddle dee dum dum dum dum

I tried to call her on the phone
Her mother said she wasn't home
I wonder where she can be
Why did she do this to me

What happens when your love has gone
What happens when dreams have ended
When all the time, you thought
Her love was true, what do you do

You're all mixed up
And your head's in a whirl
Do you go out and
Try to find another girl
Can you find one that will be true
I just don't know since we are through

Now you heard what I had to say
So I guess I'll be on my way
I really have no place to go
I must be boring you, I know

But that's what happens
When your love has gone
That's what happens when
Your dreams have ended
When all the time, you
Thought her love was true
What do you do

Diddle dee dum dum dum dum
Diddle dee dum dum dum dum dum dum
