To for-fill to need to be
Who I am in this world
Is all I ask
I can't pretend to be something I'm not
And I won't wear a mask
You've touched my face with love in your eyes
But will you touch my heart
With the understanding that it takes to realize
I just can't play a part
There's the need to be true to myself
And make my own mistakes
And not to lean too hard on someone else
No matter what it takes

So if you're sure it's love
Just be sure it's love
For this thing called me
'Cause I am what I am and
I have the need to be

I'm not fool enough to ever think
That I could be the master of my fate
But it's up to me to choose my roads in life
Rocky may well be the ones I take
There's the need to be something more than
Just a reflection of a man
I can't survive in someone's shadow
I need my own spot to stand

So if you're sure it's love
Just be sure it's love
For this thing called me
I am what I am and
I have the need to be

So if you're sure it's love
Just be sure it's love
For this thing called me
I am what I am and
I have the need to be...
