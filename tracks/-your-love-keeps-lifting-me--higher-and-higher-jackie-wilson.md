Baby, your love lifted me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before
So keep it up
Quench my desire
I'll be at your side
Forever more

I wanna tell you your love
Keep on lifting
Higher
Higher and higher
And I said your love
Keep on
Lifting me
Higher and higher

Now once I was brokenhearted
Disappointment was my closest friend
You came, you showed up, and you soon departed
And he never, ever, ever, ever
Showed his face again

That's why your love
Keep on lifting me
Higher
Higher and higher
I said your love
Keep on
Lifting me
Higher and higher

It's my favourite song!

Hey baby, I'm so glad, I finally found you
That one in a million girl
When I get my arms around you
Baby, I can stand up, right
And face the world

Let me tell you, your love
Keep on lifting me
Yes, higher
Higher and higher
And I said your love
Keep on
Lifting me
Higher and higher

Bring it down Boy-Friends

That's good, we really gotta go to the next town
So that's it, that's Ezra Furman and The Boy-Briends
We have been Jorgen, Tim, Sam and myself
We salute you, all the time

It's over, it's over right, it's all over, it's all over now
I mean, we got a lot of stuff to do
Don't you think we got things to do tonight?
One more thing man

I really mean your love
Keep on lifting me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before
Keep it up, keep it up
Quench my desire
Be at my side forever more
I wanna tell you
Your love keep on lifting me
Higher
Higher and higher
Your love keep on
Lifting me higher and higher
Saxophone, and bye bye!
