Everybody was kung-fu fighting
Those kicks were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing

There were funky Chinamen from funky Chinatown
They were chopping them up and they were chopping them down
It's an ancient Chinese art and everybody knew their part
From a feint into a slip, and kicking from the hip

Everybody was kung-fu fighting
Those kicks were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening, hell, yeah
But they fought with expert timing

There was funky Billy Chin and little Sammy Chung
He said: "Here comes the big boss, lets get it on"
We took a bow and made a stand, started swinging with the hand
The sudden motion made me skip now we're into a brand new trip

Everybody was kung-fu fighting
Those kicks were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But they did it with expert timing


Make sure you have expert timing
Kung-fu fighting, had to be fast as lightning
