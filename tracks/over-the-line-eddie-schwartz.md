Don't like learnin' the hard way
But I always do
The better things in life, baby, I've had too few

And up was usually down
One day I got turned around
When you pushed this heart of mine

Over the line
Baby, you really did it this time
Over the line
Yeah, you pushed this heart of mine
Over the line

When opportunity knocked
I was never at home
I always thought I'd face the darkness alone

One day I met you
And now I know that won't come true
You pushed this heart of mine

Over the line
Yeah, you really did it this time
Over the line
Baby, you pushed this heart of mine

I never knew what I had in store
When you won that tug of war
Baby, you pulled me into your arms

Over the line
Over the line
Over the line
Over the line
Over the line

Over the line
Baby, you really did it this time
Over the line
Yeah, you pushed this heart of mine

Over the line
Baby, you really did it this time
Over the line
Baby, you pushed this heart of mine

Over the line
Yeah, you really did it this time
Over the line
You pushed this heart of mine
