If I had just one tear running down your cheek
Maybe I could cope maybe I'd get some sleep
If I had just one moment at your expense
Maybe all my misery would be well spent

Could you cry a little? lie just a little?
Pretend that you're feeling a little more pain?
I gave now I'm wanting something in return
So cry just a little for me

If your love could be caged, honey I would hold the key
And conceal it underneath the pile of lies you handed me
And you'd hunt and those lies, they'd be all you'd ever find
And that'd be all you'd have to know for me to be fine

And you'd cry a little
Inside die just a little
And baby I would feel just a little less pain
I gave now I'm wanting something in return
So cry just a little for me

Give it up baby
I hear you're doing fine
Nothing's gonna save me
I can see it in your eyes
Some kind of heartache
Honey, give it a try
I don't want pity
I just want what is mine

Could you cry a little? lie just a little?
Pretend that you're feeling a little more pain?
I gave now I'm wanting something in return
So cry just a little for me, yeah
Cry just a little for me, whoa whoa
Could you cry a little for me?
