Any day now I will hear you say
Goodbye my love
You'll be on your way
Then my wild beautiful bird
You will have flown
Any day now I'll be all alone

Any day now, when your restless eyes
Meet someone new
To my sad surprise
Then the blue shadow will fall all over town
Any day now
Love will let me down

I know I shouldn't want to keep you
If you don't want to stay, yeah
Until you've gone forever
I'll be holding on for dear life
Holding you this way
Begging you to stay

Any day now
When the clock strikes go
You'll call it off
Then my tears will flow
Then the blue shadow will fall all over town
Any day now
Love will let me down

Oh, any day now
Oh, any day now
Don't fly away my beautiful bird
Don't fly away my beautiful bird
