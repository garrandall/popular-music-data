Any day now, I will hear you say
"Goodbye, my love."
And you'll be on your way
Then my wild, beautiful bird, you will have flown, oh
Any day now, I'll be all alone, whoa

Any day now, when your restless eyes meet someone new
Oh, to my sad surprise
Then the blue shadows will fall all over town, oh
Any day now, love will let me down, whoa

Oh my wild, beautiful bird, you will have flown, oh
Any day now, I'll be all alone

I know I shouldn't want to keep you
If you don't want to stay
Until you've gone forever
I'll be holding on for dear life
Holding you this way
Begging you to stay

Any day now, when the clock strikes "Go"
You'll call it off
And then my tears will flow
Then the blue shadows will fall all over town, oh
Any day now, love will let me down 'cause you won't be around

Don't fly away, my beautiful bird
Don't, don't fly away
