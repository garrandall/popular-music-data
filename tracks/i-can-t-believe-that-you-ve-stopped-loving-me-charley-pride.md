Tomorrow I'll say happy birthday darling
And surprise you with a gift when I come home
Then mine forgetful arms will reach out for you
I can't forget you just because you're gone
I can't believe that you've stopped loving me it's too much for me to understand
How can anything so real become a dream I can't believe that you've stopped loving me

I've sifted all the reasons why you left me
And I've gone back and relived all the love we've had
For every tear we lost I've found the thousands smiles
And the good times always outweight the bad
I can't believe that...
I can't believe that you've stopped loving me
