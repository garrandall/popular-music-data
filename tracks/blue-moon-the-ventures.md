Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for someone I really could care for

And suddenly there appeared before me
The only one my arms could ever hold
I heard someone whisper, "Please, adore me"
And when I looked my moon had turned to gold

Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own
Without a love of my own
