Pictures of you
Ohh they're still on my mind 
You had this smile 
That could light up the world 
Now when it rains it seems
The sun never shines 

And I drive
Down this lonely, lonely road
Oooh I got this feelin'
Girl I gotta let you go

Cause now you've got to fly high (fly high)
Fly to the angels
Heaven awaits your heart 
And flowers bloom in your name 
Woahh ohh 
You've got to fly (fly high), 
Fly to the angels 
All the stars in the night
Shine in your name

Though it hurts me way deep inside
When I turn and look and find 
That you're not there
I try to convince myself 
But the pain, 
The pain is still not gone 

Still I drive
Down this lonely, lonely road
Oooh I got this feelin, 
Girl I've got to let you go 

But now you've got to fly (fly high)
Fly to the angels 
Heaven awaits your heart 
And flowers bloom in your name 

Whoa 
You've got to fly (fly high) 
Fly to the angels 
All the stars in the night 
Shine in your name

Flyyy

And still I drive down 
This lonely, lonely road 
Oooh I got this feelin 
Oh, I can't let you go 

But I know 
That you've got to fly (fly high) 
Fly to the angels
Heaven awaits your heart 
And flowers bloom in your name 
Whoa oh ohh oh 
You've got fly (fly high) 
Fly to the angels 
All the stars in the sky 
Shine in your name,yeah 

Ow

oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

baby, oh 

oooh ooooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

oohh yea

oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh 

I'm gonna miss you
