Winters getting colder, Summer gettin warmer
Tidal wave comin cross the Mexican border
Why buy a gallon it's cheaper by the barrel
Just don't get busted singing Christmas carols


That's us, that's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the o-zone burnin
Funny how the world keeps turnin
Look Ma, no hands
I love this American Ride
Gotta love this American Ride

Mama gets her box off watchin desperate housewives
Daddy works his ass off payin for the good life
Kids on the youtube learnin how to be cool
Livin in a cruel world, pays to be a mean girl


That's us, that's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the o-zone burnin
Funny how the world keeps turnin
Look Ma, no hands
I love this American Ride
Gotta love this American Ride

Poor little Lithamus, Americas town.
She gained five pounds and lost her crown.
Quick fix plastic surgical antidote.
Got herself a record deal, can't even sing a note

Plasma gettin bigger, Jesus gettin smaller.
Spill a cup of coffee, make a million dollars.
Customs caught a thug with an aerosol can.
If the shoe don't fit, the fits gonna hit the shan.


That's us, that's right
Gotta love this American ride.
Both ends of the ozone burnin.
Funny how the world keeps turnin.
Hot dog, Hot damn.
I love this American ride.
Gotta love this American ride.
Oh yeah,
Na na na na na na na na
