Crashing, hit a wall
Right now I need a miracle
Hurry up now, I need a miracle
Stranded, reaching out
I call your name, but you're not around
I say your name, but you're not around


I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling, I hope
That you'll be here when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down


Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down


Running out of time
I really thought you were on my side
But now there's nobody by my side


I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling, I hope
That you'll be here when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down


Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down


Oh, I think I'm losing my mind now, yeah
Oh, I think I'm losing my mind now, yeah


I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling, I hope
That you'll be here when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
Don't let me down


Yeah, don't let me down
Yeah, don't let me down
Don't let me down, oh, no
Say don't let me down
Don't let me down, no-o
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down
