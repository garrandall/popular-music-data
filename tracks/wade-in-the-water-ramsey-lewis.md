Wade in the water
Wade in the water children
Wade in the water
Don't you know that
God's gonna trouble the water
Don't you know that
God's gonna trouble the water

I stepped in water and the water is cold
Don't you know that
God's gonna trouble the water
Said it chilled my body but not my soul
Don't you know that
God's gonna trouble the water


Well I went to the water one day to pray
Don't you know that
God's gonna trouble the water
And my soul got happy and I stayed all day
Don't you know that
God's gonna trouble the water


There is love

Oh step in, step in

Love is in the water
(In the water)
Oh step in yeah
(In the water)
For deliverance
