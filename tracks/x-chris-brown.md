If you're only as good as the company you keep
Then I'ma blame you for what they say about me
(Free your mind and let your conscience be free)
When I was by myself, I was fast asleep
Since you came around, I've been up for weeks
(Free your mind and let your conscience be free)
Yi-Yi-Yikes, I've been with the wrong crowd
I can make you a believer
If I turn the nonsense down
I keep my secrets in a safehouse (A safehouse)
Better if I don't speak (Don't speak)
Devil's tryna tempt me
They just outline my shape out (My shape out)
Place me at the crime scene (Crime scene)
I can see from this high up
You ain't got a heart, girl (You ain't got a heart, girl)
Privacy is for the cheater
Obviously you're deceiving


I know, I know just who you are
You put me on layaway
You just love to heart shop, oh girl
I think that it's over
I think that it's over


I swear to God I'm moving on
(Mmm, back up)
(Brap)
I ain't going back no more
I-I ain't going back no more, ah-ah-ah
I ain't going back no more
I-I ain't going back no more, ah-ah-ah
(I ain't trippin' off you, you, you, you)
I ain't going back no more
I-I ain't going back no more
(I ain't trippin' off you, you, you)
I ain't going back no more
I-I ain't going back no more


You just start a fight
I ain't fighting back, I'm cool with it
I simply came here to party
Why would I trip off that bullshit
When I'm on that good shit?


I swear for God I'm moving on
(Mmm, back up)


Substitute love for a better thing
I deal with my pain like a lonely child, yeah, yeah
I didn't build these walls for you to piss all on my castle
Go ahead, burn it down, I'ma build me another one
All these clouds


I know, I know just who you are
You put me on layaway
You just love to heart shop, oh girl
I think that it's over
I think that it's over


I swear to God I'm moving on
(Mmm, back up)
(Brap)
I ain't going back no more
I-I ain't going back no more, ah-ah-ah
I ain't going back no more
I-I ain't going back no more, ah-ah-ah
(I ain't trippin' off you, you, you, you)
I ain't going back no more
I-I ain't going back no more
(I ain't trippin' off you, you, you, you)
I ain't going back no more
I-I ain't going back no more


You just start a fight
I ain't fighting back, I'm cool with it
I simply came here to party
Why would I trip off that bullshit
When I'm on that good shit?


I swear for God I'm moving on
(Mmm, back up)
(Mmm, back up)
