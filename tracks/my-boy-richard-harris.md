You're sleeping, son, I know
But really this can't wait
I wanted to explain before it gets too late
For your mother and me, love has finally died
This is no happy home, but God knows how I've tried

Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy

I know it's hard to understand
Why did we ever stop
We're more like strangers now
Each acting out a part

I have laughed, I have cried
I have lost every game
Taking all that I can take
But I'll stay just the same

Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy

Sleep on, you haven't heard a word
Perhaps it's just as well
Why spoil your little dreams
Why put you through that hell

Life is no fairy tale as one day you will know
But now you're just a child
I'll stay here and watch you grow

Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy
(Repeat to fade...)
