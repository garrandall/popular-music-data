I can’t sleep
There is no sleep coming
I’m just lying here thinking about you
I’m in deep
Falling deep into the picture in my mind of everything we’re going to do

Over at the lake and down by the river
You can feel it start to rise
Want to jump in my car, go wherever you are
Because I need you by my side


It’s going to be a long, hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio, it’s such a beautiful sound
And when you say my name in the middle of the day, I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind, just waiting for the sun to go down
The sun to go down


I want to see your brown skin shimmer in the sun for the first time
I try to be the one who knows just what to do to you to get me that smile
One chance of meeting, you were walking by me on the street and I said hi
And that was the beginning of my heart spinning like these wheels in my head tonight


It’s going to be a long, hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio, it’s such a beautiful sound
And when you say my name in the middle of the day, I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind, just waiting for the sun to go down
The sun to go down


The only place that I want to be is where you are
Because anymore than a heartbeat away is just too far


It’s going to be a long, hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio, it’s such a beautiful sound
And when you say my name in the middle of the day, I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind, just waiting for the sun to go down
The sun to go down


I swear it’s like you’re waiting for the sun to go down
Waiting on the sun to go down
Hey, yeah
Oh, I’m loving thinking about you
I can't sleep, I’m just lying here thinking about you
