I canât sleep
Ainât no sleep aâcoming
Iâm just lying here thinking âbout you
Iâm in deep
Falling deep into the picture in my mind of everything weâre gonna do

Over at the lake and down by the river
You can feel it start to rise
Wanna jump in my car, go wherever you are 
âCause I need you by my side

Itâs gonna be a long, hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio, itâs such a beautiful sound
And when you say my name in the middle of the day, I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind, just waiting on the sun to go down, the sun to go down

I wanna see your brown skin shimmer in the sun for the first time
I try to be the one who knows just what to do to you to get me that smile
One chance of meeting, you were walking by me on the street and I said hi
And that was the beginning of my heart spinninâ like these wheels in my head tonight

Itâs gonna be a long, hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio, itâs such a beautiful sound
And when you say my name in the middle of the day, I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind, just waiting on the sun to go down, the sun to go down

The only place that I wanna be is where you are
âCause anymore than a heartbeat away is just too far

Itâs gonna be a long, hot summer, we should be together
All I really want is more than this moment right now
And when you say my name in the middle of the day, I swear I see the stars come out
And when you hold my hand and I look into your eyes
I swear it looks like youâre waiting for the sun to go down, the sun to go down

I swear itâs like youâre waiting for the sun to go down
Waiting on the sun to go down
Hey, yeah
Oh, Iâm loving thinking âbout you
I cant sleep, Iâm just lying here thinkinâ âbout you
