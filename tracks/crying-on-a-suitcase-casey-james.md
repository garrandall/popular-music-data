Boy don't wait, don't think, don't lock the door behind you
Run and jump into your truck, and hit the gas, burn some rubber up
Yeah your time's running out
Do it now

Take a shortcut, take a back road, take the shoulder to the exit
Skip the parking, screw the ticket, hit the curb and leave it sitting
Whatever it takes
You gotta get to that gate

She's cryin' on a suitcase
Sittin' at the airport
Waitin' on the airplane
Bout to take her out of here
Oh
They're gonna call her number
She'll sit down by the window
The plane'll leave the runway
And fade into a goodbye sky
You better run while you still got time
She's cryin' on a suitcase

Admit it boy you blew it, you really messed it up
You can make excuses if you really want to lose her
It's all on the line, do or die time
Getting on your knees time

Tell her that you want her, need her, love her, gotta have her
Everything good in your life begins and ends with her
Lose your pride while you can
Come on man be a man

She's cryin' on a suitcase
Sittin' at the airport
Waitin' on the airplane
Bout to take her out of here
Oh
They're gonna call her number
She'll sit down by the window
The plane'll leave the runway
And fade into a goodbye sky
You better run while you still got time
She's cryin' on a suitcase

She's cryin' on a suitcase
Waitin' on the airplane
Bout to take her out of here

They're gonna call her number
She'll sit down by the window
The plane'll leave the runway
And fade into a goodbye sky
You better run while you still got time
Well you still got time

She's cryin' on a suitcase
Waitin' on the airplane
She'll fade into a goodbye sky
