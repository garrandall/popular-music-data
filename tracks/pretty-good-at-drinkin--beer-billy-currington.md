I wasn't born for diggin deep holes
I'm not made for pavin long roads
I aint cut out to climb high line poles
But I'm pretty good at drinkin beer

I'm not the type to work in a bank
I'm no good at slappin on paint
Don't have a knack for makin motors crank, no
But I'm pretty good at drinkin beer

So hand me one more
That's what I'm here for
I'm built for having a ball
I love the nightlife
I love my budlight
I like 'em cold and tall

I aint much for mowin thick grass
I'm too slow for workin' too fast
I don't do windows so honey don't ask
But I'm pretty good at drinkin' beer

A go getter maybe I'm not
I'm not known for doin' a lot
But I do my best work when the weather's hot
I'm pretty good at drinkin' beer

So hand me one more
That's what I'm here for
I'm built for having a ball
I love the nightlife
I love my budlight
I like 'em cold and tall

I wasn't born for diggin deep holes
I'm not made for pavin long roads
I aint cut out to climb high line poles
But I'm pretty good at drinkin beer
I'm pretty good at drinkin beer

 So hand me one more boys...
That's what I'm here for
