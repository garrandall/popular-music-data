Walk around with my head down
But I can't hide with these high heels on
Downtown in the thick crowd
But it’s just you that my mind is on
Dressed up, got my heart messed up
You got yours and I got mine
It's unfair that I still care
And I wonder where you are tonight


Thinkin it could be different, maybe we missed it
Thinkin it could be different
It could, it could


It should've been us
Should've been a fire, should've been the perfect storm
It should've been us
Could've been the real thing, now we'll never know for sure
We were crazy, but amazing
Baby, we both know
It should've been us, us
It, it, it should've been us


Back and forth like a tug o’ war
What's it all for? Do I want it back?
Still got a little flame for ya
Even though you drove me mad
Now and then, I pretend
That it's you when I close my eyes
You got yours, I got mine
But I wonder where you are tonight


It should've been us
Should've been a fire, should've been the perfect storm
It should've been us
Could've been the real thing, now we'll never know for sure
We were crazy, but amazing
Baby, we both know
It should've been us, us
It, it, it should've been us


Oh oh, oh oh
It should've been us
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh
It should've been us
It, it, it should've been us
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh


Thinkin it could be different, maybe we missed it
Thinkin it could be different
It could, it could


It should've been us
Should've been a fire, should've been the perfect storm
It should've been us
Could've been the real thing, now we'll never know for sure
Oh, we were crazy, but amazing
Baby, we both know
It should've been us, us
It, it, it should've been us


Oh oh, oh oh
It should've been us
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh
It should've been us
It, it, it should've been us
Oh oh, oh oh
It should've been us
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh
It should've been us
It, it, it should've been us
