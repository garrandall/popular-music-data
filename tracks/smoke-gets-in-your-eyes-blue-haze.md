Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke
Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke

They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
Mmm, I of course replied
Something here inside
Cannot be denied

(Smoke gets in your eyes)
Too much smoke
(Smoke gets in your eyes)

They said someday you'll find
All who love are blind
Woah, when your heart's on fire
You must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

(Smoke gets in your eyes)
Yes, I know
(Smoke gets in your eyes)

So I chaffed them
And I gaily laughed
To think they could
Doubt my love

Yet today
My love has flown away
I am without my love
(Without my love)

Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
Whoa, so I smile and say
When a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes

(Smoke gets in your eyes)
Too much smoke
(Smoke gets in your eyes)

Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
Whoa, so I smile and say
When a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes

(Smoke, smoke in your eyes)
(Smoke, smoke in your eyes)
(Smoke, smoke in your eyes)...
