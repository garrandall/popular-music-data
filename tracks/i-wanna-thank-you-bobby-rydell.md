Hah hah hah
Hah hah hah
Scooby dooby doo
I wanna thank you

You left me made me blue
Sat around and cried for you
And then I dried my eyes
Found a girl that's paradise

She's my lady, the greatest in town
You know I wanna thank you, for puttin' me down

This girl is sweet and true
She treats me better than you
You gave me my big chance
And I found my dream romance

(Repeat verse 3 then 1)
Goodbye, farewell, so long
You know you done me wrong
Its all turned out right
That girl has dynamite
