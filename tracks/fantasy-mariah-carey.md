Keepin' it real, son, that's right
The shining star, you're my shining star, girl
Yo, New York in the house
Is Brooklyn in the house
Uptown in the house
Shaolin are you in the house
Boogie Down are you in the house
Sacramento in the house
Atlanta Georgia are you in the house
West Coast are you in the house
Japan are you in the house
Everybody are you in the house
Baby, baby come on
Baby come on, baby come on


Oh, when you walk by every night
Talkin' sweet and lookin' fine
I get kinda hectic inside
Mmm, baby, I'm so into you
Darlin', if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind


But it's such a sweet sweet, I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend, my laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning and there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming, but I'm not sleeping
My sweet fantasy
Sweet, sweet fantasy

Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you're goin' to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again




Ladies and Gentlemen
Introducing the Old, Dirty, Doggy
Here we go now
Me and Mariah
Go back like babies and pacifiers
Old Dirt Dog's no liar
Keep your fantasy hot like fire
Jump, jump, let me see you do the stump
Girls, let me see you shake your rump
Brothers, hit it from the back and front
And let's do it, do it, do it, uh-huh
I'm a little bit of Country
I'm a little bit of Rock and Roll
And I'm soul to soul
Big letters all big and bold
Old Dirty Bastard bask and blow




What you gonna do when you get out of jail?
I'm gonna do a remix
What you gonna do when you get out of jail?
I'm gon' do a remix
What you gonna do when you get out of jail?
I'm gon' have some fun
What you gonna do when you get out of jail?
I'm gon' have some fun
