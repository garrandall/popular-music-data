He realized that she was new to love
Naive in every way
Every schoolboy's fantasy she was
That's why he had to wait
If he poured his heart into a glass
And offered it like wine
She could drink and be back in time for the morning papers
They could take a walk down the ocean-side
Make a wish on every wave
They could find a carousel
And ride or kiss in every cave
They could contemplate the entire universe
Or just one star
Or just how far was the walk for the morning papers
Let me play it for you one time, oh oh
Well
Hey
Shucks
Why is age more than a number when it comes to love?
Should we ask the ones who speculate
When they don't know what it's made of?
Should we ask the moonlight on your face
Or the raindrops in your hair
Or should we ask the man who wrote it there in the morning papers?
Should we ask the moonlight on your face
Or the raindrops in your hair
Should we ask the man who wrote it there in the morning papers?


Somebody help me sing it now
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Oh yes
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Go play
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Ok
