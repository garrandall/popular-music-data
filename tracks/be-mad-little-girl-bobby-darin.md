Ah be mad little girl
But not at me
Be mad little girl
But try to see

That I can't let you stay
A minute more
Although you know
That I adore you so
Still ya bettah go

And, be mad little girl
But not at me

Ah be upset little girl
But dry your eyes
Be upset little girl
But realize

That there's nothin' that
I'd rather do than stay here
And make love to you
The whole night long
Still I know it's wrong

So, be mad little girl
But not at me

Ah not at me because
I'm not the guy who made the laws
Tellin' us what we got to do
And tellin' us what not to do
And, baby, I love you

Be mad little girl
Be mad and blue
Be mad little girl
'Cause I am too

But the more you stay
The more I find
That makes me wanna
Change my mind
It's hard to fight
So please say, "Good-night."

And, be mad little girl
But not at me

Ah not at me
Don't be mad at me
Not mad at me
