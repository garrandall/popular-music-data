You can run
You can hide
Never let it inside
Keep livin' your life in the dark
But sooner or later that gentle persuader
Is gonna catch up with your heart
Make you a dreamer, believer
Believin' in love

Right when a man's doin' all that he planned
And he thinks he's got just what he needs
Life will deliver a shock that will shiver him
Drivin' him down to his knees
Make him start givin', livin'
Livin' again

Well it's your mind
That tricks you into leavin' every time
Love will turn you around
Turn you around
Well, it's your heart
That talks you into stayin' where you are
Love will turn you around
Turn you around

Out of the blue she reaches for you
And you tell her you don't have the time
So you move away fast
But you know it won't last
'Cause you can't get her off of your mind
Thoughts are burnin', turnin'
They're turnin' around

How do you know when to stay or to go
And how do you know when it's real
You don't need a sign to make up your mind
You got your heart at the wheel
You wanna start sharin', carin'
Carin' again

Well it's your mind
That tricks you into leavin' every time
Love will turn you around
Turn you around
Well, it's your heart
That talks you into stayin' where you are
Love will turn you around
Turn you around

Love will turn you around
Turn you around
Love will turn you around
Turn you around
Turn you around
