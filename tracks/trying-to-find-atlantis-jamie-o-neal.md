I hear he's out there
Somewhere
Been looking for him everywhere
From Roswell to Timbuktu
I thought I found him once at a Jiffy Lube
But it turned in
To a dead end
So I got my oil changed and I tried again
He was a major in archaeology
I was digging on him but he wasn't on me
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is
Like trying to find Atlantis

It's a mystery
Like the deep blue sea
You can take it
You can leave it
But I still believe
So I won't give up
And I won't give in
I know I'm gonna find him
I just don't know when
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is
Like trying to find Atlantis

I met a mystic down in Memphis
We stood at the foot of the pyramid
He had me looking east
He had me looking west
Then he sold me a map and said I wish you the best
There was Elvis
Not the real one
When he told me goodbye he called me hon'
Just another shot in the dark
Like El Dorado or Noah's Ark
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is
Like trying to find Atlantis

It's a mystery
Like the deep blue sea
You can take it
You can leave it
But I still believe
So I won't give up
And I won't give in
I know I'm gonna find him
I just don't know when
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is
Like trying to find Atlantis

Oh yeah it is
It's a mystery
Like the deep blue sea
You can take it
You can leave it
But I still believe
So I won't give up
And I won't give in
I know I'm gonna find him
I just don't know when
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is
Like trying to find Atlantis

I said a girl trying to find herself the perfect man is
Like trying to find Atlantis
Trying to find Atlantis
Yeah
Oh I'm still trying to find Atlantis
Atlantis

It's a mystery
Like the deep blue sea
You can take it
You can leave it
But I still believe
So I won't give up
And I won't give in
I know I'm gonna find him
I just don't know when
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is
Like trying to find Atlantis
Like trying to find Atlantis
