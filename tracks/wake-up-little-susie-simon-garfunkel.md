Wake up little Susie, wake up, wake up little Susie, wake up
We both fell sound asleep, wake up little Susie and weep
The movie's over, it's four o'clock and we're in trouble deep


Wake up little Susie, wake up little Susie
Well, what're we gonna tell your mama, what're we gonna tell your papa
What're gonna tell our friends when they say 'ooh la la'
Wake up little Susie, wake up little Susie

Well, I told your mama that you'd be in by ten
Well, Susie baby, looks like we goofed again

Wake up little Susie, wake up little Susie, we gotta go home

Wake up little Susie, wake up, wake up little Susie, wake up
The movie wasn't so hot, it didn't have much of a plot
We fell asleep, our goose is cooked, our reputation is shot



Wake up little Susie
