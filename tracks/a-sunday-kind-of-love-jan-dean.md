I want a Sunday kind of love
A love to last past Saturday night
I'd like to know it's more than love at first sight
I want a Sunday kind of love
Bop-p-p-bop bop dip-d-dip-d-dip dip

I want a love that's honest square
Can't seem to find somebody to care
I'm on a lonely road that leads me nowhere
I want a Sunday kind of love

I do my Sunday dreamin' and all my Sunday schemin'
Every minute, every hour, every day
I'm hopin' to discover a certain kind of lover
Who will show me the way

My arms need someone to enfold
To keep me warm when Mondays are cold
A love for all my life to have and to hold
I want a Sunday kind of love

Bop-p-p-bop bop bop-p-bop-p-bop bop
