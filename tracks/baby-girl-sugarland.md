They say this town,
The stars stay up all night,
Don't know can't see'em,
For the glow of the neon lights.
And it's a long way from here,
To the place where the home fires   burn,
Well it's 2,000 miles and one left turn.


Dear Mom and Dad,
Please send money,
I'm so broke that it ain't funny.
I don't need much just enough to get me through.
Please don't worry 'cause I'm alright.
(I'm playin here at the bar tonight)
This time I'm gonna make our dreams come true...
Well I love you more than anything in the world.
Love,
Your Baby Girl

Black top blue sky,
Big town full of little white lies,
Everybody's your friend you can never be sure.
They'll promise fancy cars and diamond rings,
All sorts of shiny things.
Girl, you'll remember what your knees are for.



I know that I'm on my way,
When I can tell every time I play.
And I know it's worth all the dues I pay,
When I can write to you and say...

Dear Mom and Dad,
I'll send money. I'm so rich that It ain't funny.
Well it oughtta be more then enough to get you through.
Please don't worry cause I'm alright,
I'm stayin here at the Ritz tonight,
Whatta ya know we made our dreams come true!
And there are fancy cars and diamond rings,
But you know that they don't mean a thing,
Well they all add up to nothin compared to you,
Well, remember me in ribbons and curls...
I still love you more than anything in the world

Love,
Your Baby Girl

(Your baby girl.....
Dear Mom and Dad,
Please send money,
I'm so broke that it ain't funny,
Don't need much just enough to get me through,
Please don't worry cause I'm alright,
I'm playin here at the bar tonight..
Dreams come true....)
