You're so gorgeous I'll do anything
I'll kiss you from your feet to where your head begins
You're so perfect, you're so right as rain
You make me, make me, make me, make me hungry again


Everything you do is irresistible
Everything you do is simply kissable
Why can't I be you?


I'll run around in circles until I run out of breath
I'll eat you all up or I'll just hug you to death
You're so wonderful, too good to be true
You make me, make me, make me, make me hungry for you


Everything you do is simply delicate
Everything you do is quite angelicate
Why can't I be you?
Why can't I be you?


You turn my head when you turn around
You turn the whole world upside down
I'm smitten, I'm bitten, I'm hooked, I'm cooked, I'm stuck like glue
You make me, make me, make me, make me hungry for you


Everything you do is simply dreamy
Everything you do is quite delicious
So why can't I be you?
Why can't I be you?
Why can't I be you?
Why can't I be you?
Why can't I be you?
You're simply elegant
