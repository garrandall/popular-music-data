I met him at the place
Where we always meet
He put his arms around me
He smiled

And when I told him
I didn't love him anymore
He cried (he cried)
And when I told him
His kisses were not like before
He cried (he cried)

I knew that our romance was over and done
But for him it had just begun

And when I told him
Another boy had caught my eye
He cried (he cried)
And when I kissed him
A kiss that only meant goodbye
He cried
(He cried, he cried, he cried)

(He cried)
(He cried)
(He cried)
When I told him (he cried)
When I kissed him goodbye (he cried)
Like a baby (he cried)
Oh my Lord, what have I done? (he cried)
When I told him
