Come on

Come and get this love so we can let it go
Baby, you know, you can touch me with your love
Let's go home and touch, miss your love so much
Do anything if you touch me with your love

Let me give you some sweet affection
Girl, ya know I hunger for ya, for ya
Don't be afraid of what you're feelin'
I can't say that I know what you're thinkin'

But one thing's for sure is when we're alone
It get's so damn inviting when you give me the night
You come for me, I came to you
It keeps me so inspired 'cuz I'll see you tonight, yeah

Come and get this love so we can let it go
Baby, you know, you can touch me with your love
Let's go home and touch, miss your love so much
Do anything if you touch me with your love

To me you're somethin' kind of special
And girl ya got me dreamin', I'm thinkin', fienin' for you
One smile from you, it takes my breath away
And I can't fight it, can't hide it, so excited

Like words to a song you're my sweet melody
Intoxicating and delighting, I'll be the comfort you need
If you feel the same then let me know
Girl, I just want you to understand that I'll never let you go

You and me
We need to get together, baby
Me and you
Come and get this love
And don't be afraid, no, no

Come and get this love so we can let it go
Baby, you know, you can touch me with your love
Let's go home and touch, miss your love so much
Do anything if you touch me with your love
...
