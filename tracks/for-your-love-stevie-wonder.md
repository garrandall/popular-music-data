All the gold in all the world
Is nothing to possess
If all the things that it can bring
Can't add up to one ounce of your happiness


And for your love
I would do anything
Just to see the smile upon your face
For your love
I would go anywhere
Just you tell me and I'll be right there


A diamond that shines
Like a star in the sky
Is nothing to behold
For minuscule is any light
If it can't like you brighten up my soul


For your love
I would do anything
Just to see the smile upon your face
For your love
I would go anywhere
Just you tell me and I'll be right there
Oh yeah


I could have never fathomed this
Such joy, love, and tenderness
That you give to me, yeah
For the love I feel inside
It's so wonderful I can't hide
And I glow, I glow
With just the thought of you
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do


And for your love
I would do anything
Just to see the smile upon your face
For your love
I would go anywhere
Just you tell me and I'll be right there
One more time
For your love
I would do anything
Just to see the smile upon your face
For your love
I would go anywhere
Just you tell me and I'll, I'll be right there, yeah
Come on, one more time
And for your love
I would do anything
Just to see the smile upon your face
For your love
I would go anywhere
Just you tell me and I'll be right there
You know I'll be right there
You know I'll be right there
