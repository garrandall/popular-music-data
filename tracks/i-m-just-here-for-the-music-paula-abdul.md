Spinning to the sound
Like a record goin 'round
Must be the music
We could be making out
But all I really want right now
Is just the music
I'm only here to dance
I'm not looking for romance
So watch me work it
I gotta get a fix
Of my daily mega mix
So keep it groovin'


I'm just here for the music
I really didn't mean to turn you on
But you know I like the way you move it
So if you wanna wait for me
I'm gonna need someone to take me home


I'm diggin on the scene
The music gets the best of me
It's so addictive
No need to save my seat
Cause I'm not gonna miss a beat
I wanna freak it
Your conversation's fine
But save it for some other time
Right now I'm dancin'
Get rid of my gangster leave
If you know what I mean
I wanna do it


I'm just here for the music
I really didn't mean to turn you on
But you know I like the way you move it
So if you wanna wait for me
I'm gonna need someone to take me home

(The music)
(Music, music)
(The music)
(Music, music)


I'm here, I'm just here for the music
(Can you feel it?)
(I wanna feel it)


I'm just here for the music
I really didn't mean to turn you on
But you know I like the way you move it
So if you wanna wait for me
I'm gonna need someone to take me home
I'm just here for the music
I really didn't mean to turn you on
But you know I like the way you move it
So if you wanna wait for me
I'm gonna need someone to take me home
