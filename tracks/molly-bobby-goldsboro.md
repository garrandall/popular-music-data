The war began and Henry left his farm
Left his darling Molly with a baby in her arms
Now the war was over
And their life could begin
Molly saw her darling standing at the door again

It's so nice to hear your voice again, Molly
So nice to feel your arms around me, Molly
Oh, how happy I'd be if I only could see you
Sweet, sweet Molly
(Molly, Molly)
Please don't cry
(Please don't cry)

Maybe I should have written
To let you know ahead of time
But I was afraid you'd worry
If you knew that I'd gone blind

Do I hear you crying, Molly?
Please don't cry, you silly thing
See what you've done
You've even brought a tear to my eye

Oh how happy I'd be if I only could see you
Sweet, sweet Molly
(Molly, Molly)
Please don't cry
(Please don't cry)

Where's my son?
What does he look like, Molly?
Everyone says he took after me
Lord, I wish I could see

Come here, little man
Don't be afraid
I'm your daddy
Guess he'll get used to me in time
Won't he, Molly?

It's so nice to hear your voice again, Molly
So nice, to feel your arms around me, Molly
Oh, how happy I'd be if I only could see you
Sweet, sweet Molly
(Molly, Molly)
Please don't cry
(Molly, Molly)

Please don't cry
(Molly, Molly)
Please don't cry
(Molly, Molly)
