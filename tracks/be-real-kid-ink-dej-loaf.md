You ain't got no will, you ain't got no bottle
Let's just be honest, let's just be real
You ain't got no cash, you ain't got no dollars
You stay with that drama, let's just be real
Let's just be honest, let's just be real
Yeah, let's just be honest, let's just be real


Uh, just keep it real with ya
You the only nigga here feeling yourself
Walk in, them bitches start filming
They sittin' with a man, thotty ass still grinning, it's on
Honest, so hot, mind on a comet
Fast life sometimes feel like I'm in a comic
I don't give a fuck, bitch with or without a condom
Fat Joe, pockets lean back like a recliner
I'm in this, representing West Side
Lotta people try to tell me I'm the next guy
Batgang, got it tatted by my left eye
Chain gang over here, no neck tie
Bitch you know I'm all about the business
From beginning to the ending never simpin', never slippin'
Sippin' P-A-T-R-O-to the-N
And if I'm in the building know it's complaints from the tenants
On the real


You could call anyone you want
I'm a kill 'em all, bet on it
Said we the only ones that stuntin' now
Let's just be real


Let's just be honest, let's just be real
Yeah let's just be honest, let's just be real
Let's just be honest, we all know the deal
So let's just be honest, let's just be real


Uh, slow down back to back, it's enough, to go round back to back
Been drinkin' like you thirsty
How you make it to my section in the first place?
Nah, I ain't trippin', shit is nada
They say it ain't trickin' if you got it
Bitch I'm a boss like Gotti
Rock Tom Ford and I still pop Molly
Roll up good Cali, ladeedadee
It's just me and all my hommies
At your door like the shining, oh
Feel like can't nobody stop me, I'm a hot nigga
And the bitch that I'm with know she hot stuff
Pull up in the hot wheels, ballin' get yo hops up
If you got a problem need a hotline
9-1-1 but we don't ever call the cops, for real


You could call anyone you want
I'm a kill 'em all, bet on it
Said we the only ones that stuntin' now
Let's just be real


Let's just be honest, let's just be real
Yeah let's just be honest, let's just be real
Let's just be honest, we all know the deal
So let's just be honest, let's just be real
