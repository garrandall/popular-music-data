Bow Wow...B-Bow Wow...B-B-Bow Wow...B-B-B-Bow Wow Wow
Bow Wow...B-Bow Wow...B-B-Bow Wow...BOW WOW WOW

B-ow Wow (repeated)


I bow wow wow yippy-o yippy-a to the funk
Punk
I put you in my trunk
Like a good fella, I'm a good speller
Yet I get retarded like Hellen Keller
Take it, I'll kick it, better I'll flick it
Just like a booger, I fuck around with hookers
Like Tina Turner, I'm a fast learner
Earning up my wealth, now I go for self
Like Barney Rubble, who's always in trouble
I'm quick on the double, you'll never see me fumble
Like a quaterback, think I outta smack
Wack MCs who think they're all of that


I Bow Wow Wow yippy-o yippy-a to the funk
A Bow Wow Wow


It ain't no hassle, I'll grab my lasso
Check a punk asshole, like Eddie Haskell
Yet I'm not the Beaver or Sigourney Weaver
I'll bust a stunt punk like Colt Seavers
Then do the polka, I'm iller than the Joker
I'm not mediocre, like almond mocha
I'm flavor, behavior is ill when I spill
You'll be fucked just like Fire Marshall Bill
Cause I cause disasters like the Dukes of Hazzard
I'll shatter you kid if you step punk bastard
Zero, Weirdo, the Funk Superhero
Yeah you scare me, just like a scarecrow


I Bow Wow Wow yippy-o yippy-a to the funk
A Bow Wow Wow


Eenie meenie, I funk like Houdini
No I run shit punk, like Mussolini
I'm skinny
Kid like me dreams of tiny bikinis
Ralph rocks a beanie
Flips it, smacks it, do the Michael Jackson
Bring your crew punk, cut you in fractions
Action packed, wanna come back
On the drunk track, sharp like a thumbtack
I'm in the congos, I chill like Tonto
When it comes to the funk, I rock pronto


I Bow Wow Wow yippy-o yippy-a to the funk
A Bow Wow Wow
