Oh baby, honey what's wrong with you
Oh baby, honey what's wrong with you
Now you don't treat me baby
Like you used to do

You got me a-runnin' babe
You got me a-hidin' too
Tell me, tell me, tell
What you gonna do

Oh baby, honey what's wrong with you
Now you don't miss me baby
Like you used to do

You got me a-runnin' babe
You got me a-hidin' too
Tell me, tell me, tell
What you gonna do

Oh baby, honey what's wrong with you
Now you don't miss me baby
Like you used to do

You got me a-runnin' babe
You got me a-hidin' too
Tell me, tell me, tell
What you gonna do

Oh baby, honey what's wrong with you
Now you don't miss me baby
Like you used to do
