Tell me what I have to do tonight
Cause I'd do anything to make it right
Let's be us again
I'm sorry for the way I lost my head
I don't why I said the things I said
Lets be us again

Here I stand with everything to lose
All I know is I don't wanna ever see the end
Baby please, I'm reachin out for you
Won't you open up your heart and let me come back in
Lets be us again
Us again

Look at me Im way past pride
Isn't there some way that we can try
To be us again
Even if it takes a while
I'll wait right here until I see that smile
That says we're us again

Here I stand with everything to lose
All I know is I don't wanna ever see the end
Baby please, I'm reachin out for you
Won't you open up your heart and let me come back in
Lets be us
Ohhh

Baby baby, what would I do
Can't imagine life without you

Here I stand with everything to lose
All I know is I don't wanna ever see the end
Baby please I'm reachin out for you
Won't you open up your heart and let me come back in
Oh here I am I'm reachin out for you
Won't you open up your heart and let me come back in
Lets be us again
Oh, lets be us again
