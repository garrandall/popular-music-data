You don't know what's going on
You've been away for far too long
You can't come back and think you are still mine


You're out of touch, my baby
My poor discarded baby
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time


Well, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
You are left out
Out of there without a doubt 'cause
Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time


The girl who wants to run away
Discovers that she's had her day
It's no good you're thinking that you are still mine


You're out of touch, my baby
My poor unfaithful baby
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time


Well baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Yes, you are left out
Out of there without a doubt 'cause
Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time


You thought you were a clever girl
Giving up your social whirl
But you can't come back and be the first in line, oh no


You're obsolete my baby
My poor old-fashioned baby
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time


Well baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Yes, you are left out
Out of there without a doubt 'cause
Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

Sing the song now

Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time


You don't know what's going on
You've been away for much too long
But you can't come back and think you are still mine


You're out of touch, my baby
My poor discarded baby
I said Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time


Well baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Yes, you are left out, yes you are
I said no, out of there without a doubt 'cause
Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time


I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're...
