I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to fake it
The only time we really talk
Is when our clothes are coming off
I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then I'll lay in it instead
I like us better when we're wasted
Oh oh oh oh oh

You are a glass half empty
Sipping my ocean dry
Emotionally spend me
Till none of our planets could align
But I could stand you one more night

I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then I'll lay in it instead
I like us better when we're wasted
Oh oh oh oh oh

You are a catch 22
Either way I miss out
All of the grief I'd give you
Is energy I can live without
But I could stand you one more night

I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then I'll lay in it instead
I like us better when we're wasted
Oh oh oh oh oh

I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then I'll lay in it instead
I like us better when we're wasted
Oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh
