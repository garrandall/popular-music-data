Gee whiz, look at his eyes
Gee whiz, how they hypnotize
He's got everything a girl could want
Man, oh, man, what a prize
(What a prize) ooh-ooh

Gee whiz (gee whiz) he's all the joy
Gee whiz (gee whiz) I could find in a boy
He's awful nice, it's paradise
I hope that I'm his decoy (his decoy)

Heaven up above knows how much
I love that fellow so
Angels sing of the love that he brings
I hope our love will grow and grow

Oh, gee whiz (gee whiz) I love that guy
Gee whiz (gee whiz) my, my, oh my
There are things we could do
I could say I love you

There are things we could do
I could say I love you
But all I can say is
Gee whiz
