Whoa, when I woke up this morning
She was gone, solid gone
When I woke up this morning
She was gone, solid gone

I used to love to watch her dance
That grizzly bear
I guess she's gone to Frisco, whoa
To dance out there

'Cause when I woke up this morning
Yeah, she was gone, solid gone

I used to love to watch her dance
That grizzly bear
I guess she's gone to Frisco, whoa
To dance out there

'Cause when I woke up this morning
Yeah, she was gone, solid gone

She did not even tell me (did not even tell me)
The reason why she was gone
She did not even tell me (did not even tell me)
The reason why she was gone

I used to love to watch her dance
That grizzly bear
I guess she's gone to Frisco, whoa
To dance out there

'Cause whoa, when I woke up this morning
Yeah, she was gone, solid gone
