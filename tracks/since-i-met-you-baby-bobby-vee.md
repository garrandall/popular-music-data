Since I met you baby
My whole life has changed
Since I met you baby
My whole life has changed

And everybody tells me
That I am not the same

I don't need nobody
To tell my troubles to
No, I don't need nobody
To tell my troubles to

'Cause since I met you, baby
All I need is you

Since I met you, baby
I'm a happy man
Since I met you, baby
I'm a happy man

I've gotta try to please you
In every way I can
