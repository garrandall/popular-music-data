I've gotta make you love me,
I've made up my mind, made up my mind
I've gotta make you love me girl,
I've got nothing but time, nothing but time.

If it takes me forever I know girl,
These lonely arms are gonna get ya
I knew that you were the one for me,
On that rainy day when I met ya
Cause if you try to fight it's senseless,
Cause I'll break down your walls
And tears down you're fences with love, love
Love, love, love, love (I'm gonna get ya)

I've gotta make you love me,
You satisfy me, satisfy me
I've gotta make you love me girl,
You're all that I need, all that I need

I've got one life to live and one love to give,
With you I know I can make it
I've got one heart to break so I've gotta make
You see how much I really love you

Cause if you try to fight it's senseless,
Cause I'll break down your walls
And tears down you're fences with love, love
Love, love, love, love (I'm gonna get ya)

I've gotta make you mine, I've gotta make you mine,
I've gotta make you mine, I've gotta make you mine,
I've gotta make you mine, I've gotta make you mine,
I've gotta make you mine, I've gotta make you mine,

I've gotta make you love me, I've gotta make you love me,
I've gotta make you love me, I've gotta make you love me,
I've gotta make you love me, I've gotta make you love me,
I've gotta make you love me, I've gotta make you love me
(Fades)
