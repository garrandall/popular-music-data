Girl, it's been a long time comin'
But I just have to say
I love you baby

Hey little mama
Ainât gotta ask you if I want to
Just tell me, can I get a light?
Roll you up and let it run through my veins

âCause I can always see the farthest stars when Iâm on you
I donât wanna ever come down off this cloud of lovinâ you

Now you got me hopped upon that pusher love
So high Iâm on the ceiling baby
Youâre my drug
So gonâ and be my dealer baby
Light me up
âCause all I want is you, baby

Yeah youâre my little pusher love girl
Ainât ya? Oh, oh, yeah.
You're my little pusher love girl

Hey little mama
I love this high weâre on too
And I know that your supply
Wonât run out anytime soon

You gave me a taste, now I know that thereâs no getting off you
I donât wanna ever come down off this cloud of lovinâ you

Now you got me hopped upon that pusher love
So high Iâm on the ceiling baby
Youâre my drug
So gonâ and be my dealer baby
Light me up
âCause all I want is you, baby

Since you came around
Iâve been living a different life
And I donât wanna come down
From this love and I got on high
People call me an user, but I want you
To go on and use me too
Nothing else to do
All I want is you, baby

Bring it down now
(Pusher love...)
Blood shot eyes, Iâm hopped upon it
You ainât gotta think twice, just hop upon it
Thereâs a million names for your kind of chronic
Thatâs pusher love, thatâs what I call it

Pusher love
So high Iâm on the ceiling baby
Youâre my drug
So gonâ and be my dealer baby
Light me up
âCause all I want is you, baby

Pusher love, be my drug, hook me up
Cause all I want is you
Youâre my little pusher love girl
