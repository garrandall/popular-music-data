Hey little mama
Ain't gotta ask me if I want to
Tell me, can I get a light?
Roll you up and let it run through my veins
'Cause I can always see the farthest stars when I'm on you
I don't wanna ever come down from this cloud of loving you


'Cause now you got me hopped up on that
Pusher love
So high, I’m on the ceiling, baby
You're my drug
So gon' and be my dealer, baby
Roll me up
'Cause all I want is you, baby
One more time
Pusher girl
So high, I’m on the ceiling, baby
Be my drug
So gon' and be my dealer, baby
Hook me up
All I want is you, baby
You're my little pusher love girl, ain't ya?
Just my little pusher love girl


Now hey little mama
I love this high we're on to
And I know that your supply
Won't run out anytime soon
You gave me a taste, now I know that there's no getting off you
I don't wanna ever come down off this cloud of lovin' you


'Cause now you got me hopped up on that
Pusher love
So high, I’m on the ceiling, baby
You're my drug
So gon' and be my dealer, baby
Roll me up
'Cause all I want is you, baby
One more time
Pusher girl
So high, I’m on the ceiling, baby
Be my drug
So gon' and be my dealer, baby
Hook me up
All I want is you, baby
You're my little pusher love girl, ain't ya?
Just my little pusher love girl


Since you came around
I've been living a different life
And I don't wanna come down
From this love I got on high
And people call me a user
But I want you to go on and use me too
Nothing else will do
All I want is you babe, I know
Baby, you know who you are


Now you got me hopped up on that
Pusher love
So high, I’m on the ceiling, baby
You're my drug
So gon' and be my dealer, baby
Roll me up
Cause all I want is you, baby
One more time
Pusher girl
So high, I’m on the ceiling, baby
Be my drug
So gon' and be my dealer, baby
Hook me up
All I want is you baby, one more time
'Cause now you got me hopped up on that
Pusher love
So high, I’m on the ceiling, baby
You're my drug
So gon' and be my dealer, baby
Roll me up
'Cause all I want
All I want
All I want is you, baby
Pusher girl
So high, I’m on the ceiling, baby
Be my drug
So gon' and be my dealer, baby
Hook me up
All I want is you, baby, yeah
You're my little pusher love girl
So sweet, yes you are (Oh, oh, oh, yeah)
Just my little pusher love girl, ain't ya? (Oh, oh, oh, yeah)
She's my little pusher love girl


Sing it, pusher love
I'm just a, junkie for your love
I'm just a, junkie for your love (C'mon)
Now I'm just a, junkie for your love (I'm hopped up on it)
And now I'm just a junkie for your love (Break it down)
My heroine, my cocaine, my plum wine, my MDMA
I'm hopped up on it, it won't go away
Now I can't wait 'til I get home and get you in my veins (Pusher love)
I'm just a, junkie for your love (I'm hopped up on it)
And now I'm just a, junkie for your love (Pusher love)
I'm just a, junkie for your love (I'm hopped up on it)
And now I'm just a, junkie for your love
Uh, my nicotine, my blue dream, my hydroponic candy jelly bean
Did you fix me up, I'm your number one fiend
Be my little pill and just creep into my bloodstream
Bloodshot eyes, I'm hopped up on it
You ain't gotta think twice, just hop up on it
There's a million names for your kind of chronic
Uh, that pusher love, that's what I call it (Pusher love)
I'm just a, junkie for your love (I'm hopped up on it)
Now I'm just a, junkie for your love
Let me hear you say (pusher love)
Now I'm just a, junkie for your love (I'm hopped up on it)
And now I'm just a, junkie for your love
(Pusher love)
(Pusher love)
(Pusher love)
