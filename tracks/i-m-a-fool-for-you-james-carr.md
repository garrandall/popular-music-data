Oh, I'm a fool for you
I'm a fool for you
If you want me to, baby
I'll break some rules for you

(Means I'm a fool for you
I'll be a tool for you)

Ain't nothing, baby
I wouldn't do for you
Now listen

I'd walk through the
Burning desert sand
Just to walk beside you
And hold your little hand

I'd make you
A rainbow in the sky
Just to master the facts
Of how they glitter in your eye

I'm a fool for you, baby
I'm a fool for you
If you want, baby
I'll break all the rules for you

(Means I'm a fool for you
I'll be a tool for you)

Ain't nothing, baby
I wouldn't do for you

(Maybe work two jobs
Seven days and nights a week
You can do most anything
Yours to do whatever you please)

Yes, I'm a fool for you
I'm a fool for you
It ain't nothing in this world
I wouldn't do for you

You can use me
You can accuse me
(Use my heart
For a stepping stone)

Take my soul, baby
I'm yours to hold now
(I'd cut myself
Right down to the bone)

I'm a fool for you, baby
I'm a fool for you
I'm a fool for you, baby
I'm a fool for you
