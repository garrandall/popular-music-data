(It's been a long, long time)
(It's been a long, long time)


It's been a long, long time
Since I've wanted to hold, hold you close
And I long just to (hold you close, hold you close)
It's been a long, long time
And oh, it's been a long time
Since I've wanted to kiss your sweet lips
Yes, I long just to (kiss you once, kiss you twice)
It's been a long, long time, oh yeah


You know I (been all over the world)
I been all over this world
(Searching for someone like you)
Searching for someone like you
(Much to my surprise) oh
You came, you came into my view and oh


It's been a long, long time
Since I've wanted to hold, hold you close
And I long just to (hold you close, hold you close)
It's been a long, long time since I
(held you close, held you close)
I wanna (kiss you once, kiss you twice)
It's been a long time since I
(held you close, held you close)
I wanna
