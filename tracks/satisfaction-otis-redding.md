I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
I have tried, I have tried
I have tried, I have tried

I can't get me no, ha, ha
I can't get no, uh, now

When I'm driving in my car
And the man talks on the radio
Keep tellin' me more and more
About that useless information
He's tryin' to mess up my imagination

And I can't get me no, no, no
And I can't get me no
Hey, hey, hey, what I say
You gotta, gotta, gotta groovy

We gotta have it, we gotta have it
We gotta have it, we gotta have it
Keep on grooving, keep on grooving
We keep on grooving, God, no, my, yeah

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no, no satisfaction

I have tried, I have tried
I have tried, I have tried, tried, tried
I can't get me no, no, no
And I can't get me no, no, no, no

We gotta groove it, groove it, oh my now
We keep on knockin', knockin' baby, yeah
Ow, gotta, gotta have it
We gotta, keep, keep, ah

Whatever, why won't you wait for time
This little girl is tryin' to put me down
I keep on runnin' round in my sleep
I keep on messin' up any beat

I keep on rockin', I try to find me
Somebody to love me
And give me some reaction
And I can find nobody, no, no, nobody
Give me no faction, faction
Faction got to have it
Satisfaction, we got to have it
Satisfaction, earlier in the morning
Satisfaction, later in the evening
Satisfaction, and don't make my
