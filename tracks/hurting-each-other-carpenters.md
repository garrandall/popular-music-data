No one in the world
Ever had a love as sweet as my love
For nowhere in the wolrd
Could there be a boy as true as you love

All my love
I give gladly to you
All your love
You give gladly to me
Tell me why then
Oh why should it be that

We go on hurting each other
We go on hurting each other
Making each other cry
Hurting each other
Without ever knowing why

Closer than the leaves
On a weepin' willow baby we are
Closer dear are we
Than the simple letters "A" and "B" are

All my life
I could love only you
All your life
You could love only me
Tell me why than
Oh why should it be that

We go on hurting each other
We go on hurting each other
Making each other cry
Hurting each other
Without ever knowing why

Can't we stop hurting each other
Gotta stop hurting each other
Making each other cry
Breaking each other's heart
Tearing each other apart
