When you gonna buy me a canned ham
I've been waiting so long
When you gonna buy it
When you gonna satisfy me

When you gonna buy me a canned ham
I've been waiting so long
When you gonna buy it
When you gonna satisfy me

I like a canned ham baby (baby)
Canned ham that's for me
When I think about it
Sends me into ecstasy

Put it in a skillet
Fry it nice and brown
Put it in my pocket
Gonna carry it around and around and around and around

When you gonna buy me a canned ham
I've been waiting so long
When you gonna buy it
When you gonna satisfy me

When you gonna buy me a canned ham
I've been waiting so long
When you gonna buy it
When you gonna satisfy me

I like a canned ham baby (baby)
Canned ham that's for me
When I think about it
Sends me into ecstasy

Put it in a skillet
Fry it nice and brown
Put it in my pocket
Gonna carry it around and around and around and around

Been waiting, I've been waiting so long

When you gonna buy me that canned ham Greenbaum?
Someday
