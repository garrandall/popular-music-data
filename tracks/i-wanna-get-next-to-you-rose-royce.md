Sittin here in this chair
Waitin on you
ah baby to see things my way
But not a word do you say
You won't even look my way, yeah
Girl I'm spendin my dimes
Wastin my time
Talkin til I'm black and blue
Uh can't you see
I wanna get next to you

Dreams of you when I go sailing by
When ever your eyes meet mine
Your so fine
And girl you make me feel so insecure
You're so beautiful and pure
Why must you be unkind
And tell me I'm not your kind
Blowin my mind
Girl my, my money is low and I know
That I can't take you to the fancy places
You might wanna go
Still I wanna get next to you
I wanna get next to you

Baby yeah

Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah yeah

Girl you can bend me, shape me, make me
What ever it takes to please you
I'm willing to do
Cause you're my dream come true
And I wanna get next to you
Baby yeah
I wanna get next to you
I wanna make you mine for all of time
(I wanna get next to you)
I promise I'll never make you blue
I wanna get next to you
So let love begin between me and you
(I wanna get next to you)
Girl I'm in love with you
(I wanna get next to you)
