Baby baby baby!

I'm high
I can't come down
Ever since
You came around

I'm high
There's no doubt
It feels so good
You're so far out

Baby baby baby girl
You know you turn me on
You are so sexy, sister, sing your song
Baby baby baby girl
You turn on all my fire
And your sweet love takes me higher

I am high, high on your love

I'm high
Too high to cope
I'm high on love
Ain't had no dope, nah
I'm high
It's such a thrill
You said I could
I said I will

Baby baby baby girl
You know you turn me on
You are so sexy, sister, sing your song
Baby baby baby girl
You turn on all my fire
And your sweet love takes me higher

I am high, high on your love

I'm high on your love now baby babe
(Get on up, get on up)

Everybody get up, get high on the funk
(Get stoned, get a little stoned)

Everybody get up, let's dance on the funk
Sing on the funk
Get high on the funk

High, love down baby
Play on it

I am high, high on your love
