Welcome to the planet
Welcome to existence
Everyone's here
Everyone's here

Everybody's watching you now
Everybody waits for you now
What happens next
What happens next

I dare you to move
I dare you to move
I dare you to lift yourself up off the floor
I dare you to move
I dare you to move
Like today never happened
Today never happened before

Fumbling his confidence 
And wondering why the world has passed him by, by
Hoping that he's bent for more
than arguments and failed attempts to fly, fly 

What happens next
What happens next

I dare you to move
We were meant to live for so much more 
Have we lost ourselves?
Somewhere we live inside
Somewhere we live inside
We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
Somewhere we live inside

Maybe redemption has stories to tell
Maybe forgiveness is right where you fell
Where can you run to escape from yourself?
And everything inside screams for second life

I dare you to move
(We were meant to live)
I dare you to move
(for so much more)
I dare you to lift yourself, lift yourself up off the floor
I dare you to move
(We were meant to live)
I dare you to move
Like today never happened
Today never happened
Today never happened
Today never happened before
