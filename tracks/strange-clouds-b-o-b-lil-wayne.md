Yeah
Hahaha
Oh you already know we gon' do
Hahahaha
Hey


Well, if you guessin' it's me, you guessed correctly
I just stay with a stallion, you would swear I was an equestrian
I hit her with that pipe, call that Nancy Kerrigan
Stay on the greenest greens, call us vegetarians
You be on that minor league, but we smoke professionally
I do my job exceptionally, on point like a decimal is
The way I ride on the beat man I be in the street it's done so effortlessly
Yeah, so these niggas can't sleep on me, there's no Inception in this bitch
I'm top chef, you top ramen, I'm top shelf
No last call, to the bartender, what you got left?
Pour it up, don't stop there, hold your cup, take a shot, yeah
All night we celebrate, cause we everywhere and you not there
Ha,


All we do is pour it up
All night, drinks out
(That's how we do it)
(That's how we do it)
And all we do is light it up
All night, all you see is strange clouds
Strange clouds, strange clouds


Blue jeans, I'm faded, mindin' my own data
Smokin' on that strong, that Arnold Schwarzenegger
It's Tunechi Lee you bitch you, you hot as an igloo
Kick back on that glock, call that Jiu Jitsu
Hello world, I'm with a yellow girl, number 2 pencil
These rappers is washed up, spin cycle, rinse you
My nigga, all day, all night, half pipe
I dive in that pussy, yeah I belly flop, I jackknife and shit
And tell my homies that I say it's a party
Got that tech for technical difficulties
I'm top dog, you top ramen, I'm top dog
Piru, gangsters, outlaws
Yeah!
(Young Mula baby)


All we do is pour it up
All night, drinks out
(That's how we do it)
(That's how we do it)
And all we do is light it up
All night, all you see is strange clouds
Strange clouds, strange clouds


Well ain't no question, yes, it's B.o.B yes definitely
Up in the studio, I got on my necessities
If you want that real shit, you made the right selection
I'm Decatur 'til I die, yes, I rep that definitely
They say I'm a celebrity, what the fuck's a celebrity?
I guess I must invest in the proper form of protection
And I, say it's a curse but it's emotionally a blessing
To a nigga from the hood tryna aim for the top
But I don't even need no directions
I just wake up and then I roll up the purp
But these niggas wake up on my dick
At least have some breakfast first
Nigga keep your nourishment first and your mind on my lyrics
Cause what you hoping to accomplish I already did it bitch


All we do is pour it up
All night, drinks out
(That's how we do it)
(That's how we do it)
And all we do is light it up
All night, all you see is strange clouds
Strange clouds, strange clouds
