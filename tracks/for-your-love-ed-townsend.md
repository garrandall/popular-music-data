For your love, oh, I would do anything
I would do anything, for your love

For your kiss
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Oh, I would go anywhere
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I would go
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Anywhere, for your kiss

More foolish I grow
With each heart beat
But we all get foolish
That's why I repeat

For your love
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Oh, I would do anything
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I would do anything, for your kiss

I would do anything, for your love
(Anything, anything, anything)
For your love
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh)
