(A woman is a man's best friend)
(A woman is a man's best friend)
Some like dogs and cats
And some like little white rats
And some people just can't say
But I tell what I'd do
If you want me to
I'd take all the woman away

Because I said it before
And I'll say it again
A woman is a man's best friend, oh yeah
A woman is a man's best friend

You can teach your dog
To do many things
But a woman you'll never replace
Because how would you like
To wake up in the morning
And look a dog in the face

Oh well I said it before
And I'll say it again
A woman is a man's best friend, what I say now
A woman is a man's best friend

Don't get me wrong
I mean no harm
But it's something you just can't see
I tell what I do
If it's alright with you
You take the animals, leave the women to me

Marylin' Monroe, ain't she somethin' though
I'll bet there's not a guy around
Oh but there's?
Unless?

Oh well I said it before
And I'll say it again
A woman is a man's best friend, who's your friend, now
A woman is a man's best friend, 'til the end now
A woman is a man's best friend, yeah, say it again, tonight
A woman is a man's best friend, I'll catch ya nice
A woman is a man's best friend, give me a woman, any old time
