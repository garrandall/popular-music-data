Your face is a masterpiece
A lovely, unusual and unique
Work of art to explore

I can't resist the urge
To steal a glance at you
But when i do
I just can't stop
I have to look at you some more

And i get hung up in your eyes
Hung up on your smile
And i can't concentrate
On anything but you

I get hung up in your eyes
Hung up on your smile
I get so hung up on you

Your eyes seem to say to me
I want you, i need you
Can't you see that
I feel that way too

Somehow the way you look
Has got ahold of me
How can it be
I wanna need you more
Each time i look at you

And i get hung up in your eyes
Hung up on your smile
And i can't concentrate
On anything but you

I get hung up in your eyes
Hung up on your smile
I get so hung up on you

I get hung up in your eyes
Hung up on your smile
And i can't concentrate
On anything but you

I get hung up in your eyes
Hung up on your smile
I get so hung up on you

I get hung up in your eyes
Hung up on your smile
And i can't concentrate
On anything but you
