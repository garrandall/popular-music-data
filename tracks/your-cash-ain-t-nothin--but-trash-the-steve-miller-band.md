Your cash ain't nothing but trash (Take 1)
Here we go
Yeah, you may have heart about the gangster of love and the space cowboy
But I'm going to whip a cat on you right now who's had more trouble, trials and tribulations
One, two, three, hey
Yeah
It's alright
Look here


I was walking down the main track
One night
I met a fine chick
She was built just right
She stopped when I flashed my roll
I told her she could have all of my dough
She turned around and with a frown
She said this ain't no circus
And I don't need a clown


Your cash ain't nothing but trash
Your cash ain't nothing but trash
Your cash ain't nothing but trash
And there ain't no need in your hanging around


Just to make a hit with that chick
I tried to get a Cadillac right quick
The man at the place he looked so strange
I had 900 bucks and some change
We disagreed
I tried to plead
Well, he said I ain't a chicken
And I don't need your feed


Your cash ain't nothing but trash
Your cash ain't nothing but trash
Your cash ain't nothing but trash
Well, baby you're crawling way past your speed


I was walking into town in my white bucks
A man with a gun, he said hands up
I tried to get away but too slow
He got me and took all of my dough
I heard him shout
As he cut out
Well you ain't lost nothing
What you crying about


Your cash ain't nothing but trash
Your cash ain't nothing but trash
Your cash ain't nothing but trash
And he took my watch and I passed out


I woke up in the arms of a big cop
Police station
Next stop
Judge swung his fist down
Plunk plunk
$20 fine cause you're drunk
Pick up the dough
And you can go
All I had was a buffalo


Your cash ain't nothing but trash
Your cash ain't nothing but trash
Your cash ain't nothing but trash
But I'm sure going to get me some more
