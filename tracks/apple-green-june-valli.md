Don't the sun shine sunnier?
Don't the kiss taste honeyer?
And all the world look apple green
When you're 17 and in love

Don't your feet feel dancier?
And your heart romancier?
And don't the moon look apple green?
When you're 17 and in love.

Everything just seems to be in bloom.
There's something in the air
That smells like sweet perfume.

Don't you feel so all aglow?
When you're young, that's how you know.
And all the world looks apple green
When you're 17 and in love.
