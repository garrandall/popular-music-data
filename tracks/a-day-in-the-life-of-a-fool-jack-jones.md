A day in the life of a fool
A sad and a long lonely day
I walk the avenue and hope I'll run into
The welcome sight of you coming my way

I stop just across from your door
But you're never home any more
So back to my room and there in the gloom
I cry tears of goodbye
'Till you come back to me that's the way it will be
Every day in the life of fool
