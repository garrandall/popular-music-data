Aaah ah

This is the tale of Captain Jack Sparrow
Pirate so brave on the seven seas
A mystical quest to the Isle of Tortuga
Raven locks sway on the ocean's breeze

Ohhh oh

From the day he was born, he yearned for adventure
Old Captain Jack giving them what for
He's the pauper of the surf, The Jester of Tortuga
But is Davy Jones' locker what lies in store?

This is the tale of the Disney marauder
The true Pirate Lord, The Crustacean King
Dismissed as a fool
And then hailed as a hero
Sir Captain Jack lives on in you and me
