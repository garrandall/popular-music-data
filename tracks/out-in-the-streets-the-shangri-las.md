He don't hang around with the gang no more
He don't do the wild things that he did before
He used to act bad, used to, but he quit it
It make me so sad 'cause I know that he did it for me

(Can't you see now)
And I can see
(It's still in the streets)
His heart, is out in the streets

He don't comb his hair like he did before
And he don't wear those dirty old black boots no more
But he's not the same, somethin' about his kissin'
That tells me he's changed, I know that something's missing inside

(Somethin's gone)
Somethin's died
(It's still in the streets)
His heart, is out in the streets

He grew up on the sidewalk, streetlight shinin' above
He grew up with no-one to love
He grew up on the sidewalk, he grew up running free
He grew up and then he met me

He don't hang around with the gang no more
Gee, he doesn't smile like he did before
I wish I didn't care, I wish I'd never met him
They're waitin' downstairs, I know I've got to set him free

(Send him back)
He's gotta be
(Out in the streets)
His heart is out in the streets

He don't hang around with the gang no more
(Out in the streets)
He don't hang around with the gang no more
(Out in the streets)

He don't hang around with the gang no more
(Out in the streets)
He don't hang around with the gang no more
(Out in the streets)
