Who Q's that knocking on my door
All last night and the night before
Boom boom boom
Bang bang bang
I can't stand this awful thing
Who's that knocking on my door

Who's that calling calling my name
Tossed a brick through my windowpane
Boom boom boom
Bang bang bang
You keep driving me insane
Who's that knocking on my door

All last night as I lie in bed
With my lights down low
I heard approaching footsteps
Boom boom boom
Bang bang bang
On my door

Who's that knocking on my door
Could it be Mable could it be Flo
I got myself in an awful fix
When I got involved with those two chicks
Who's that knocking on my door

Who's that knocking on my door
All last night and the night before
Boom boom boom
Bang bang bang
I can't stand this awful thing
Who's that knocking on my door

Do do do wah
Bang bang bang
Do do do wah
Bang bang bang
Do do do wah
Bang bang bang
All night long
