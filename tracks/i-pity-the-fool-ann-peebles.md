I pity the fool
Whoa, I pity the fool
Yeah, I pity the fool
Hey, I pity the fool that falls in love with you
And expects you to be true
Oh, I pity that fool

Look at the people
I know you wonder what they're doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me

Look at the people
I know you wonder what they're doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me

Oh, I pity the fool
Hey, I pity the fool
Oh, I pity the fool
I pity the fool
That falls in love with you

He'll break your heart one day
Then he'll laugh
And be on his merry way
That's why I pity the fool

Look at the people
I know you wonder what they're doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me

Look at the people
I know you wonder what they're doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me

I pity the fool
I say I pity the fool
Whoa, I pity the fool
I pity that give her heart to you
He'll take your love away
Till he find another fool to play
That's why I pity the fool

Look at the people
I know you wonder what they're doing
They're wondering whose life next will you ruin
