I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from


DJ Khaled, We the best
I'm goin in, I'm goin in

I do it for the hood cause the hood told me I should

If you rep yo hood, and you goin hard
If the they hatin on you don't stress
Tell them niggas that we the best

Fuck nigga, you can't stop this
Fuck the best we run this game
Kanye West, Khaled and Pain


If you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard
But I won't let you get to me
You should already thinkin I'mma go hard
If you were as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo yard
Makin money ain't shit to me
This in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go hard
You got another way to live, you gots to go hard
I am gettin it in until the end I got to go, go, go, go, go hard


I go the hardest
Flow so retard
I'm disgusted with myself
I mean uhh, were do I start
First I spin around and vomit
Then I shit up on it
Fuck the beat up so bad
Won't nobody get up on it
I flow sick, nigga how sick?, sea sick
Got your hand out don't look at me bitch
You lookin at who made me rich
You lookin at who made me rich
I have some wins some losses
Just a life of a God damn boss's
With the top off lookin for a girl with a ass as fat as Tracey Ross's
This is dope as is get
Dope as a mother fuckin acid trip
Fly as 57 passengers
This finna be another classic bitch
Everybody know I got if you want it then get at it
But I ain't gon have
No I ain't gon have it




I ain't ever been scurred
Never been the type to bite my words
When I came up y'all gave me shit
Now I'm finna make y'all eat them turds
Always said what the fuck I felt
Gon head spit that murder I wrote
Man I don't care bout what you felt
Fuck you nigga I know I'm dope
Felt like I'm comin to get my all
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall
Felt like niggas was stuntin on me
Funny how I'm flyer than them all
Now I'm at the top ain't nowhere to go now
Instead of me she gon go down
Maybe I would have slowed down if I knew what I know now
I'm stupid you know I'm dumb
This could fuckin get old while it's good I'm young
But my heart get cold as the hood I'm from
Tell me what it take to be number one
I guess it's gon be what it's gon be
But here's one thing y'all got to hear
I'm a tell you like George Bush told me
Fuck ya'll niggas I'm out of here
