Sweet wonderful you,
You make me happy with the things you do.
Oh, can it be so?
This feeling follows me wherever I go.

I never did believe in miracles,
But I've a feeling it's time to try.
I never did believe in the ways of magic,
But I'm beginning to wonder why.

I never did believe in miracles,
But I've a feeling it's time to try.
I never did believe in the ways of magic,
But I'm beginning to wonder why.

Don't, don't break the spell.
It would be different, and you know it will.
You, you make loving fun,
And I don't have to tell you, but you're the only one.

You, you make loving fun.
It's all I wanna do.
You, you make loving fun.
It's all I wanna do.

You, you make loving fun.
It's all I wanna do.
You, you make loving fun.
It's all I wanna do.
