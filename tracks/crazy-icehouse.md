I've got a pocket full of holes.
Head in the clouds, the king of fools.
You've got a ribbon of rainbows,
the sun in your eyes burning through.
Could be I'm happy and sad,
could be I'm losing my head over you.

Well, you've gotta be crazy, baby to want a guy like me.
Yeah, you've gotta be out of your mind - crazy.

So if I'm dreaming don't wake me tonight.
If this is all wrong, I don't want it right.
'Cause you're the one sure thing
when I get lost in the game once again.
Hey, I'm a lucky guy without a reason and I don't understand.

Well, you've gotta be crazy, baby,
to want a guy like me (to want a guy like me).
Yeah, you've gotta be out of your mind - crazy (crazy crazy crazy).
Well, there must be some kind of mistake to give your heart away.
Yeah, you've gotta be out of your mind crazy.

Well, you've gotta be crazy, baby to want a guy like me.
Yeah, you've gotta be out of your mind - crazy .
Well, there must be some kind of mistake to fall in love with me.
Well, you've gotta be out of your mind - crazy crazy
Well, you've gotta be crazy, baby to want a guy like me.
Yeah, you've gotta be crazy, baby...
