You say that everything will work itself out
But let me tell you now
What you don't know about
It's easy to turn your back on our problems
But can't you see
That it's no way to solve them

You can run away from me
But you'll never get away from you
You can run away from me
But you'll never get away from you

Sayin' sorry don't make it right every time you hurt me
Sayin' sorry don't make it right
When we don't meet eye to eye every time it hurts me
Sayin' sorry don't make it right, no no

I know that mistakes are so hard to deal with
But when you reject me
I always feel it
And when you choose to ignore
What you don't understand
You will find often time how things get out of hand

You can run away from me
But you'll never get away from you
You can run away from me
But you'll never, never get away

Sayin' sorry don't make it right every time
You hurt me
Sayin' sorry don't make it right
When we don't meet eye to eye every time
It hurts me
Sayin' sorry don't make it right
No, no

Every time that you break my heart
You come back to me
And try to make a new start
But this hurt only gives me doubt
And it seems you don't wanna work things out

Ay, ay, ay, ay
Uh, uh
Oooh, ooh

Take your sorry
Uh
Out the door
I don't wanna hear that
Uh
Uh-huh
Anymore

Take your sorry
And baby, this is the plan
You can take that sorry, baby
And stick it
Oooh

Sayin' sorry don't
Sayin' sorry don't make it right
When we don't meet eye to eye every time
It hurts me
Sayin' sorry don't make it right

Sayin' sorry don't make it right
Sayin' sorry
Ohhh

When we don't meet eye to eye every time
It hurts me
Sayin' sorry don't make it right
It won't make things right
Won't make things right

When we don't meet eye to eye
Every time it hurts me
Sayin' sorry don't make it right
I don't wanna hear you say
I don't wanna hear you say you're sorry
For what you did to me

Ooh, baby
Baby, get
Baby, get
Baby, get hold of this
I can take only just so much
And I have taken what I intend to take
