Beautiful, beautiful time of year
We get together and celebrate and cheer
Looking back and knowing that
Youâre never alone wherever you are call home

Light the fire its getting cold outside
Hear the choir singing in the yuletide
The moon is out, festival of light
I wonder what gifts weâll get tonight

Donât need no silver or gold
Want something I can hold
Togetherâ¦

We got all the love we need
Underneath the Christmas tree
Seasons come and go
I want you to know
We got all the loveâ¦

We got all the love we need
Underneath the Christmas tree
Seasons come and go
I want you to know
We got all the loveâ¦
We need.

Sleigh bells ringing out in the snow
Sweet smells of candy apples, ohh
âDreidel Songâ on the radio, Santa whereâd you go?
Oh, Ho ho ho ho ho ho

Donât need no silver or gold
Want someone I can hold
Foreverâ¦

We got all the love we need
Underneath the Christmas tree
Seasons come and go
I want you to know
We got all the loveâ¦

We got all the love we need
Underneath the Christmas tree
Seasons come and go
I want you to know
We got all the loveâ¦
We need.

I wonder what itâs like to fall like the snow
I dream of kisses underneath the mistletoe

We got all the love we need
Underneath the Christmas tree
Seasons come and go
I want you to know
We got all the loveâ¦

We got all the love we need
Underneath the Christmas tree
Seasons come and go
I want you to know
We got all the loveâ¦

We got all the love we need
Underneath the Christmas tree
Seasons come and go
I want you to know
We got all the loveâ¦

We need.
