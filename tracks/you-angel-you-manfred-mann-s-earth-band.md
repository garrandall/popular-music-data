You angel you
You got me under your wing
And the way you walk and the way you talk
Feel I could almost sing

You angel you
You're as fine as anything's fine
Though I just walk and I watch you talk
Your memory's on my mind

Even though I can't sleep at night for trying
Well, I never did feel this way before
I never did get up and walk the floor
If this is love then give me more
And more, and more, and more, and more

You angel you
You're as fine as fine can be
And the way you walk and the way you talk
Is the way it ought to be
You angel you

Well, I never did feel this way before
I never did get up and walk the floor
If this is love then give me more
And more, and more, and more, and more

You angel you
You got me under your wing
And the way you walk and the way you talk
Feel I could almost sing

You angel you
You're as fine as anything's fine
Though I just walk and I watch you talk
Your memory's on my mind

Even though I can't sleep at night for trying
Well, I never did feel this way before
I never did get up and walk the floor
If this is love then give me more and more
