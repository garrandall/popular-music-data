(CHORUS)
Green, green,
It's green they say,
On the far side of the hill.
Green, green,
I'm going away to where
The grass is greener still.

A-well, I told my mama
On the day I was born,
Don't you cry
When you see I'm gone.

You know there ain't no woman
Gonna settle me down.
I just gotta be traveling on,
A-singing...

(CHORUS)

Nah, there ain't nobody
In this whole wide world
Gonna tell me how to spend my time.
I'm just a good loving rambling man,
Say, buddy, can you spare me a dime?
Hear me crying, it's a...

(CHORUS)

Yeah, I don't care
When the sun goes down,
Where I lay my weary head.
Green, green valley or rocky road,
It's there I'm gonna make my bed.
Easy, now...

(CHORUS)

Everybody, I wanna hear it now...

(CHORUS)
