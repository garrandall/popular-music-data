To believe
Or not to believe
That is the question
It takes a street degree
You've lied your last lie
And I've cried my last cry
I'm out the door, babe
There's other fish in the sea

Girl, make a list
Go out and find yourself a new play thing
Girl, you need a trip
'Cause he's not worth the misery and pain
Just remember how he would tell you lies
And then pretend that everything is so sweet
Why should you sacrifice
If he's not satisfied
He's just a canine runnin' 'round in heat

Girlfriend
How could you let him treat you so bad, oh
Girlfriend
You know you were the best he ever had, oh, oh, oh
(Oh, girlfriend)

How could you let him (treat ya, treat ya, treat ya) so bad, oh
Girlfriend
You know you were the (best he ever had), oh, oh, oh

Girl, you must resist
Don't let him squirm his way into your heart
No, girl, I must insist
You've got to stop the thought before he starts
Just remember how he was so untrue
And all the tacky things he did to you
No need to signify
'Cause he's not worth your time
You need to find someone that's true to you (true to you)

Girlfriend
How could you let him treat you so bad, oh
Girlfriend
You know you were the (best he ever had), hay oh, oh, oh
Girlfriend
How could you let him treat so bad (treat ya, treat ya) baby don't be sad, now
Girlfriend
You know you were the best he ever had, oh, oh, oh

To believe
Or not to believe
That is the question
It just takes a street degree
You've lied your last lie
And I've cried my last cry
I'm out the door, babe
There's other fish in the sea
Ya
Cute (cute, cute, cute)

Hey deal - sing
To believe
Or not to believe
That is the question
It just takes a street degree
You've lied your last lie
And I've cried my last cry
I'm out the door babe
There's other fish in the sea

Girlfriend, how could you let him treat you so bad
Girlfriend, you know you were the best he ever had

Girlfriend
How could you let him treat you so bad, oh
Girlfriend
You know you were the best he ever had, oh, oh, oh
Oh, girlfriend
How could you let him (treat ya, treat ya, treat ya) treat you so bad
Oh, girlfriend
You know you were the (best he ever had) oh, oh, oh

Don't let him put you down
Girl, he's been messing around
You've been used, abused
Baby, make your move
You've learned your lesson now
So turn this hurt around
Don't be no fool, 'cause you've got to much to lose

Girlfriend
How could you let him treat you so bad, oh
Girlfriend
You know you were the best he ever had, oh, oh, oh

Don't let him put you down
Girl, he's been messing around
You've been used (used) abused (abused)
Baby, make your move
You've learned your lesson now
So turn this hurt around
Don't be no fool, fool 'cause you've got to much to lose

Girlfriend
How could you let him treat you so bad, oh
Girlfriend
You know you were the best he ever had, oh, oh, oh

Girlfriend
How could you let him treat you so bad, oh

Girlfriend
You know you were the best he ever had, oh, oh, oh

Girlfriend
How could you let him treat you so bad, oh

Girlfriend
You know you were the best he ever had, oh, oh, oh

Girlfriend!
