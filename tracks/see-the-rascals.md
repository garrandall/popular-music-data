Things ain't like they used to be, love's the only thing I see
Wings of life are taking flight from the darkness to the light

I used to try and fly away upon the flood of dreams
Tasting all the good and bad from on the serpent's tree
Little ones remind us of a place we used to be
Echoes of the ever land discover who you really am

Rivers rushing to the sea, love is flowing endlessly
Drops of rain are never lost, soul and spirit to the source

Yes I saw you in a fairy tale or was it just a dream ?
White and yellow jasmine trees, time a mere machine
Flashes of a New Year light up a stellar sky
Love is really everywhere, to see it is to fly

Things ain't like they used to be, if you want to you can see
Words of love on chestnut trees written by sweet memories

While we are riding on the avenues of time
The bird of life drinks drinks from the cups of wine
Waits until we're ready for the Prince's gift of love

Things ain't like they used to be, love's the only thing I see
Wings of life are taking flight from the darkness to the light

The secret mirror photographs shining in your eyes
I'm married to the universe, my brother is the sky
Stars can see to make a wish and hearts with wings can fly
So come with me and see my love so we can never die

Rivers rushing to the sea, love is flowing endlessly
Drops of rain are never lost, soul and spirit to the source

Things ain't like they used to be, love's the only thing I see

Things ain't like they used to be, love's the only thing I see
Things ain't like they used to be, love's the only thing I see

Things ain't like they used to be, love's the only thing I see
Things ain't like they used to be, love's the only thing I see
Things ain't like they used to be, love's the only thing I see
