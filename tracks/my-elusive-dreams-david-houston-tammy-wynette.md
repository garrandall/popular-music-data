I followed you to Texas
I followed you to Utah
We didn't find it there, so we mo-oved on
I followed you to Alabam'
Things looked good in Birmingham
We didn't find it there, so we moved on
I know you're tired of followin'
My elusive dreams and schemes
For they're only fleeting things
My elusive dreams
I had your child in Memphis
You heard of work in Na-ashville
We didn't find it there, so we mo-oved on
To a small farm in Nebraska
To a gold mine in Alaska
We didn't find it there, so we moved on
And now we've left Alaska
Because there was no go-old mine
But this time, only two of us moves on
Now all we have is each other
And a little memory to cling to
And still you won't let me go on alone
I know you're tired of followin'
My elusive dreams and schemes
For they're only fleeting things
My elusive dreams
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
For they're only fleeting things
My elusive dreams
