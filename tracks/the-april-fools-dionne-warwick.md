In an April dream
Once you came to me
When you smiled, I looked into your eyes
And I knew I'd be loving you
And then you touched my hand
And I learned, April dreams can come true

Oh, we're just April fools
Who can't see all the danger around us
If we're just April fools
I don't care
True love has found us now

Little did we know
Where the road would lead
Here we are a million miles away from the past
Travelin' so fast
Now, there's no turning back
If our sweet April dream doesn't last

Are we just April fools
Who can't see all the danger around us
If we're just April fools
I don't care
We'll find our way somehow
No need to be afraid
True love has found us now
