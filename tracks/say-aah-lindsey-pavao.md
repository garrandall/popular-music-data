Go girl its ya birthday
Open wide I know you're thirsty
Say ahhh
Say ahhh
And we dont buy no drinks at the bar
Pop champagne cause we got that dough
Let me hear you say ahhh
You want me say ahhh

(1)
Pocket full of money
Club dont jump
Till I walk inside the doorway
Bottles of that Ros√©
Smelling like Dolce and Gabanna
Shorty you the baddest and to meet you is an honor
I got a table waiting what you think about a convo
But if you like it baby we could take it to the condo
And if you like the convo
We could move the party to the bedroom
Im a beat your body like a congo
Since we in the club for now
Might as well get another round
I notice it ain't nothing in your cup
So get here baby let me fill it up

Shorty dance like a video vixen
Said her man be on that bullshit pimpin
Well I retired from the bull like Pippen
Try to get you home or would you be Marge Simpson
Whip out front we can leave like pronto
Maple leave glass got you feeling like Toronto
Make your body rise like your puffing on a joint though
Girl that's only if you want tho
Since we in the club for now
Might as well get another round
I notice it ain't nothing in your cup
So get here baby let me fill it up
