Tell me why you came here
Was it just to sit and stare?
Wont you come go with me
Take out some time?

If you'll give me a hand
I know that we could jam
Lets get on down right now
Lets get on down

Now don't you wanna jam tonight?
Jam tonight?
Jam tonight?
Don't you wanna jam tonight?

There's a new dance in town
Now who could be sitting down?
You've got to move in time
The time must go on

Clap your hands, pat your feet
Now you have got the beat
Its not too hard to keep
Once you start to jam

Now don't you wanna jam tonight?
Don't you wanna jam tonight?
Don't you wanna jam tonight?
Don't you wanna jam tonight?

Oh, don't you wanna jam?

Don't you wanna?
Oh, don't you wanna jam?

Yeah!

Come on and sing along
Do whatever you feel as long
As you have a good time, that's all
Just have a good time

Don't you wanna jam?
Don't you wanna jam?
Don't you wanna jam?
Don't you wanna jam?

Don't you wanna, oh
Don't you wanna jam?
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you wanna
Oh, oh, oh don't you wanna jam?
Yeah, yeah!

I wanna jam, I wanna jam, yes I do
I wanna have the last dance with you

Jam the night away
I wanna, I wanna jam with you
Put your hands in mine

I wanna jam, I wanna jam with you baby, yeah
Yeah, girl, come on lets do it the way we love to do
Lets jam the night away!
