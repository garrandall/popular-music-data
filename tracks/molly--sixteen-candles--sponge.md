Seen you naked in the bath
Cigarette stains on your hands
Wilted flowers in a vase
I ask "how are you?"
Yeah, "how are you?"

I see the lipstick on your glass
I think you're drunk, I start to laugh
I find your note, the letters ran
It said "I love you"
Yeah, "I love you"

Don't ask why, don't ask why
Don't ask why, don't ask why
Don't ask why, don't ask why, don't ask why

Sixteen candles down the drain

I watch you passed out forever
I touch your face, you start to smile
And on your note is my reply
"I wish I loved you"
"I wish I loved you"

Don't ask why, don't ask why
Don't ask why, don't ask why
Don't ask why, don't ask why, don't ask why

Sixteen candles down the drain
(The drain)
Sixteen candles down the drain
(The drain)
Sixteen candles down the drain
(The drain)
Sixteen candles down the drain
(The drain)

Don't ask why, don't ask why, don't ask why, don't ask why
Don't ask why, don't ask why, don't ask why

Sixteen candles down the drain
(The drain)
Sixteen candles down the drain
(The drain)
Sixteen candles down the drain
(The drain)
Sixteen candles down the drain
(The drain)
