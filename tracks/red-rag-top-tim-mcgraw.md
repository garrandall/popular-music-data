I was twenty and she was eighteen
We were just about as wild as we were green
In the ways of the world

She picked me up in that red rag top
We were free of the folks and hiding from the cops
On a summer night
Runnin' all the red lights

We parked way out in a clearin' in a grove
And the night was as hot as a coal burnin' stove
We were cookin' with gas, knew it had to last

In the back of that red rag top
She said, "Please don't stop."

Well, the very first time her mother met me
Her green-eyed girl had been a mother-to-be for two weeks

I was out of a job and she was in school
And life was fast and the world was cruel
We were young and wild
We decided not to have a child

So we did what we did and we tried to forget
And we swore up and down there would be no regrets
In the morning light
But on the way home that night

On the back of that red rag top
She said, "Please don't stop
Lovin' me."

We took one more trip around the sun
But it was all make-believe in the end
No I can't say where she is today
I can't remember who I was back then

Well, you do what you do and you pay for your sins
And there's no such thing as what "might've been"
That's a waste of time
Drive you outta your mind

I was stopped at a red light just yesterday
Beside a young girl in a cabriolet
And her eyes were green
I was in an old scene

I was back in that red rag top
On the day she stopped
Loving me
I was back in that red rag top
On the day she stopped
Loving me
