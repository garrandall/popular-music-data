Who's gonna love me baby
Who's gonna hold me now
Kiss me tenderly
And rub my body down
Make love by candlelight
Keep me warm at night
I can't believe all you left me in memories

As I lay here baby
Wishing you're here with me
And you were touching me
Making my body scream
How could you leave me baby
With all these memories
Tell me what the hell am I supposed to be feeling now

Baby you're so fine
You're always on my mind
I think about you all the time
Don't you know I love you so
I never wanna let you go baby
'cause I still remember yesterday

I still remember yesterday
You took your love and went away
And now your love is just a memory
I still remember yesterday

I rehearse in my mind
More than a thousand times
This broken melody
That reminds me
I cannot tell a lie
I kept you satisfied
But no one could ever come close to you with me

Baby you're so fine
You're always on my mind
I think about you all the time
Don't you know I love you so
I never wanna let you go baby
'coz I still remember yesterday

I still remember yesterday
You took your love and went away
And now your love is just a memory
I still remember yesterday

Oh...
You're so fine
You're always on my mind
I think about you all the time

You're so fine...
