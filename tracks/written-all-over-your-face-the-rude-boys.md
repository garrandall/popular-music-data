Oh baby, how I wish that I could be your star
If I could have one wish then it would be all this, that I could be your star

I can see right through, you're a little player like the rest, it's true
Only difference is that I'm feeling you, trying hard to fight it, what am I to do
Present yourself with so much style, full of confidence, oh yes you drove me wild
Reckon that I wrecked it when you came my way, I stumbled on my words, I didn't know what to say


I wish that I could be your girl, she must be a lucky girl
If you don't ever have a girl, let me know, cute boy
I wish that I could be your girl, she must be a lucky girl
If you don't ever have a girl, let me know, cute boy

Said I'll wait on you, boy I'm bugging, I want you to make a move
I've never been the one to really stress a dude
forgive me 'cause this feeling here is so brand new
It's written all over your face, you know you got me feeling this whole crazy way
I'm tripping, yea am tripping but I'll be ok
if I could find the nerve to hurry up and say


I wish that I could be your girl, she must be a lucky girl
If you don't ever have a girl, let me know, cute boy
I wish that I could be your girl, she must be a lucky girl
If you don't ever have a girl, let me know, cute boy

I see you coming through, boy, looking like a rude boy
Just the way I like it and that's the truth, boy
So I chill for a minute, sat back and observe
What kind of chicks you checking, right before I step in
Do you like the thick ones or slim ones with curves
I peeped your whole style you don't watch them birds
So you gonna feel the girl that's no question
You know that I'm the one then there's no second guessing

Oh, baby, how I wish that I could be your star
If I could have one wish then it would be all this, that I could be your star
Oh, baby, how I wish that I could be your star
If I could have one wish then it would be all this, that I could be your star


I wish that I could be your girl, she must be a lucky girl
If you don't ever have a girl, let me know, cute boy
I wish that I could be your girl, she must be a lucky girl
If you don't ever have a girl, let me know, cute boy
