Saturday night, everybody havin' fun
You don't know it but I'm havin' me some
You left me at home, thought I would die
Down and lonely, thought I would cry

Oh, we're havin' a wild weekend
We're havin' a wild weekend
Reelin' and a-rockin'
Rockin' and a-rollin'

I met me a girl, she thought I was fine
Oh-oh, chick come with me we'll have a good time
She got all dressed up when I took her out
Well she's not that cute but she treats me right

Oh, we're havin' a wild weekend
We're havin' a wild weekend
Reelin' and a-rockin'
Rockin' and a-rollin'

Reelin' and a-rockin'
Rockin' and a-rollin', wooo!
Reelin' and a-rockin'
Rockin' and a-rollin', rockin' and rollin'
Reelin' and a-rockin'
Rockin' and a-rollin', ohh!

Reelin' and a-rockin'
Rockin' and a-rollin', wooo!
Reelin' and a-rockin'
Rockin' and a-rollin'
I said, reelin' and a-rockin'
Rockin' and a-rollin'
