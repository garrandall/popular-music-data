Well Hey Hey baby tell me what's your name
From the way you look and the way you dress
I can tell you ain't got no shame

And that's alright
'Cause I'm just a man

You say you're from the city
And it all moves so fast
Got your fancy cars and your diamond rings
You don't need a love to last

And that's alright
'Cause I'm just a man

So take me home tonight
Like you know that you should
When you're ready to be bad
Just give it-Give it to me good

Me I'm just a rocker
Ain't got much to say
I never did things by the rules
Always did things my way

And that's alright
'Cause that's the way I am anyway

My father was a teacher
And he taught me how to live
He said "Son, you gotta be someone-
Not takin' more than you give"

And that's alright
That's the way I am Palio

So take me home tonight
Like you know that you should
When you're ready to be bad
Just give it

Give it Give it to me good
Give it Give it to me good
Give it Give it to me good
Give it Give it to me good
C'mon c'mon
Give it Give it to me good

Now that we're together
I'm gonna show you a thing or two
Hey girl you got a lot to learn
I'm gonna take you to my school
And make you feel alright

'Cause I'm a man-I'm a man
Give it to me good

Give it Give it to me good
Give it Give it to me good
Give it Give it to me good
Give it Give it to me good
