Just Blaze.. make it knock

Ladies if you walkin' through the mall and you hear some one go (whistle)
I gotta turn back at them and do the same thang (whistle)
It's the new 2003 call Ladies
Haha Fo shizzle

So So Def


All I'm trynna do is get my doe up
I'm your boy you're my girlfriend - stop!
Hold up I ain't in no kinda rush to grow up
so slow up I'm just playing the game
I'm warning you girl before you get involved with me
You might think you got me
but you never really got me but you never really had me
So don't trip when you see me doing my thang
I told ya I'm just playing the game


I'm at the mall on Saturday 
I ain't got no cap on my salary so you know I'm tearin' it up
I mean there is so many girl here everytime
I look I see them looking back at me and they say what up
I'm too young to wife sumthing, so you know my game is pumpin
Like baby lets lets hang do sumthin
What about the digits can I get that she write them down
I give her a pound and say ma holla back
Next door just more of the same activity
I'm up in Tiffany talking to this girl name Britney
She trynna roll with me, she trynna shop with me
She trynna do whatever it takes to get with me
Like I'm easy, how you gonna act like my name ain't Bow Weezy and
I ain't got breezy come in about a dozen
That's why the phone is buzzing
I'm sorry but I'm not looking for long time luvin


All I'm trynna do is get my doe up
I'm your boy you're my girlfriend. Stop!
Hold up I ain't in no kinda rush to grow up
so slow up I'm just playing the game
I'm warning you girl before you get involved with me
You might think you got me
but you never really got me but you never really had me
So don't trip when you see me doing my thang
I told ya I'm just playing the game


Its hard to hold back when you 15
Got money by the stack and jumpin outta candy color lacs'
And every show packed to the rim girls screamin at me
Oooh how you make me happy I just wanna ride DADDY
Am I wrong for not wanna be tied up when
I'm grown maybe baby we can ride but right now
I'm just trynna do a lil cameo in life
Do it up right and see whoever I like
I'm trynna find me sumthin in ever city
I go from New York to La back to Ohio
I am trynna find m something pretty
Ghetto and fun 15-21 is that true
If it is when you hear I'm coming to your city
Make sure you're in the front row
Hands in the air scream loud as you can
Hear I am hear I am Bow Weezy let's go




Yea Bow Weezy I'm 15 years old just got my tints you know
I'm on a pace man I can't be slowin down
I need a girl thats gonna ride with me
If you that girl let's go let's go
