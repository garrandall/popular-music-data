I remember the days when we never had a dime
And our dreams seemed a million miles away
But we made it baby, facin' the bad times with a smile
Here we are and we're growin' stronger day by day

'Cause we got love times love
It's always there for us to share
And girl it sure feels good
To know you're by my side

'Cause we're just two high hearts
That beat as one forever on
With love times love
To keep us satisfied every night

So my lady whisper the words I love to hear
Cuddle up and I'll make you feel all right
'Cause I need you baby to carry me on through all the years
So come on baby close the door and dim the lights

'Cause we got love times love
It's always there for us to share
And girl it sure feels good
To know you're by my side

'Cause we're just two high hearts
That beat as one forever on
With love times love
To keep us satisfied every night

And there ain't no one in this world tonight
Can change my point of view
So come on girl and hold me tight
The way you always do with love times me and you

'Cause we got love times love
It's always there for us to share
And girl it sure feels good
To know you're by my side

'Cause we're just two high hearts
That beat as one forever on
With love times love
To keep us satisfied every night

'Cause we got love times love
It's always there for us to share
And girl it sure feels good
To know you're by my side

'Cause we're just two high hearts
That beat as one forever on
With love times love
To keep us satisfied every night

We got love
It sure feels good
Carry me on through all the years
Keep me satisfied
??
