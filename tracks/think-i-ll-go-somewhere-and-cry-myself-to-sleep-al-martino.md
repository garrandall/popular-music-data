I just kissed the one I love for the last time
And never have her soft lips been so sweet
She's gone away and won't be back forever
Think I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep

I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep
Not because I'm sad-because I'm weak
I can't stand the thought of life alone without her
Think I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep

Just before she said "goodbye" she called me "darling"
And slowly ran her fingers down my cheek
I thought I'd die when she said she still loved me
Think I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep

I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep
Not because I'm sad-because I'm weak
I can't stand the thought of life alone without her
Think I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep
