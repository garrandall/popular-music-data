Yet I know
I know
There's no one else for me
Yes I know
I know
There's no one else for me
Yes I know
I know
There's no one else for me
Yes I know

Someday I hope
I wake up feeling differently
And find at last
That you and I are through
I'll be free of the love
That has chained me to you
Yet I know
Yet I know

You won't believe that I am really leaving you
And that I'll take back my heart with no regret
Not a tear
Not a sigh
I'll just say goodbye
Then I'll turn and walk out of your life
And forget

Yet I know
I know
There's no one else for me
Yes I know
I know
There's no one else for me
Yes I know
I know
There's no one else for me
Yes I know

I'll find two arms
Two other lips to welcome me
And you'll become
A faded memory
Out of sight out of mind
And my heart will be free
Yet I know
Yet I know

You'll think I'm weak
And I'll come running back to you
So you'll be strong
And play the waiting game
Don't wait too many years
When I dry my tears
And I'll almost forget how you look
And your name

Yet I know
I know
There's no one else for me
Yes I know
I know
There's no one else for me
Yes I know
I know
There's no one else for me
Yet I know
