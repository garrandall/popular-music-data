I heard from a friend of a friend of a friend that
You finally got rid of that girlfriend
You finally came out of that love coma boy
I've heard Mary Jane at the powder-puff beauty shop
Sayin' that blond in her tube top
She left our Jimmy for a boy in Illinois
Someone give me an amen,
Someone give me an amen.


Can I get a Thank God Hallelujah
You finally saw what she was doing to ya
Your mama called it and she was right
Glad to see you saw the light.
Whole town nearly hooped and hollered
She drove away nobody stopped her
Na na na na na na, I'll say it again
Someone give me an amen.

Yeah right, like I really coulda said something
You wouldn't heard it if the train was coming
Had your head so high in the clouds
Oh I, I had a really good reason
For hiding my feelings but now I can finally spit it out
Someone give me an amen.
Someone give me an amen.


Can I get a Thank God Hallelujah
You finally saw what she was doing to ya
Your mama called it and she was right
Glad to see you saw the light.
Whole town nearly hooped and hollered
She drove away nobody stopped her
Na na na na na, I'll say it again
Someone give me an amen.

I'm standing right here in front of you
I think I love you too
Can I get a Thank God Hallelujah
Baby do you believe it, do you?
Your mama called that she was right
Glad to see you saw the light.
Whole town nearly hooped and hollered
The preacher's son and the farmer's daughter.
Na na na na na, I'll say it again
Someone give me an amen.
Someone give me an amen.
Na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na
