(Very funky)
Gotta make it funky one more time, Fred (Yeah)
Gotta make it funky (Make it funky)
Make it funky, make it funky, make it funky, make it funky

("Make it funky" repeated in the background)

Fred, Fred, slide your slide; slide your slide, Fred
Fred, wait a minute; wait a minute, Fred
I see you got a funny looking horn there
That's a bllack horn - why is it black?
You call that a what? Oh, looka here
'Cause mine don't look like that horn, but, haha, looka here
Yeah, you said you were from L.A. - yeah, that's Lower Alabama
Yeah, alright, I got another name, Byrd, but uh...hahaha
I ain't gon' get too deep in on it
You know, that's a hip thing, though
See how that cat slide to get that groove, see that
Slide, if you hit that slide
I know you were slick - he had to be slick when he was on the corner
He sure got a lot of slide
Yeah, I guess that's when come on out to join us
'Cause the man gon' get to him now
So brother, can you slide us on into grooveland?
Take me to loveland, take me to grooveland



Oh yeah! Come on
