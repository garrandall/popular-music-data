Bang! Bang!

It was a warm night on the south side of town
They said they'd seen ya
You were sneakin' around with a stranger
Girl these rumors are drivin' me mad

All my good friends turn their face to the wall
When they see me, what the hell's goin' on am I so blind
That I can't see when I'm being had

I know it's silly but girl I really thought we had a chance
I must've been crazy!

Chorus:
Bang Bang, what's that sound
I gave you my love and you shot me down
Bang Bang, you're so cool
Playin' a game, someday you're gonna lose
Bang! Bang!

Girl you told me you were not like the rest
Then you showed me now you're failing the test
It was easy just an urge in the heat of the nite

I believed you, now that's all in the past
Cause I made some mistakes but I'm learnin' fast
Never put your heart on the line!
Never put your heart on the line!

I know it's silly but girl I really thought we had a chance
I must've been crazy!
