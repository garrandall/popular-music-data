Live every moment - love every day
'Cus before you know it your precious time slips away.
Live every moment - love every day
'Cause if you don't you might just throw your love away.
I walked for seven miles this mornin'. Footprints in the sand.
Washed away without a warning when the water hit the land.
But I will walk on 'til I can no longer stand.
I'll take you by the hand and we'll...

Live every moment - love every day
'Cus before you know it your precious time slips away.

There's water in the wind tonight.
There's a chill in the air.
It's coolin' down my skin tonight
Soakin' through your hair.
There's warmth enough within' tonight
for both of us to share.
We can take it anywhere. And we'll...

Live every moment - love every day
'Cus before you know it your precious time slips away.

Sometimes I wish we could take a trip far away.
Leave all this trouble and heartache and pain for another day.
I will search for that place but 'til I find it all I can say is...

Live every moment - and love every day
