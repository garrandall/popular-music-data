Child I'm a fool for yer
And I ain't too proud of that fact
But when it comes to love and pride
Pride is something that I seem to lack

Our relations in danger
And you act like a stranger
But this time I'm not blind
And I ain't got the time

Ain't got time ... ain't got no time
Ain't got time ... ain't got no time

I'm not playin' cahoots
And you didn't cut me loose
I won't say that we're losin'
Just a mutual choosin'
'Cause what is yours I find
Is just yours and not mine
You're not gonna mess up my mind
'Cause I ain't got the time

Ain't got time ... ain't got no time
Ain't got time ... ain't got no time
Ain't got time

Child I'm a fool for yer
And I ain't too proud of that fact
But when it comes to love and pride
Pride is something that I seem to lack

Our relations in danger
And you act like a stranger
But this time I'm not blind
And I ain't got the time

Ain't got time ... ain't got no time
Ain't got time ... ain't got no time
Ain't got time ... ain't got no time
Ain't got time ... ain't got no time

You're not gonna mess up my mind, ain't got time
Cause this time I'm not blind, ain't got time
Another you'll have to find, ain't got time
With some compatible sign, ain't got time
You're not gonna mess up my mind, ain't got time
But this time I'm not blind, ain't got time
Another you'll have to find, ain't got time
