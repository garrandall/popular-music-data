What my baby needs now
Is a little more lovin'
What my baby needs now
Is a little more lovin'

One day, found myself
Feeling sad
But then I remembered
All the times that we had

Then I knew it
Wasn't what I was doing
I found out for myself
It was what I
Wasn't doing for you
And I said

What my baby needs now
Is a little more lovin'
What my baby needs now
Is a little more lovin'

Some people laughing
They don't know what it's all about
And I, I promise myself
I, I, I won't lose out

What my baby needs now
Is a little more lovin'
What my baby needs now
Is a little more lovin'

I love you, darling
I know it's true
And when the times get hard
I know you're gonna see me through

What my baby needs now
Is a little more lovin'
What my baby needs now
Is a little more lovin'

Our love grows
Stronger day by day
And when people
Try to break us up
I say, ain't no way

What my baby needs now
Is a little more lovin'
What my baby needs now
Is a little more lovin'

What my baby needs now
Is a little more lovin'
What my baby needs now
Is a little more lovin'

What my baby needs now
Is a little more lovin'
What my baby needs now
Is a little more lovin'
