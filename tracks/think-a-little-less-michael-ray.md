Midnight's creepin' in, we know better
Than leavin' here together
And in case you were wondering
You've never looked hotter
So why even bother
Lookin' at the reasons not to
Maybe we ought to

Kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burnin' up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
And kiss a little more
And kiss a little more
Think a little less

When your friends start askin' you to look 'em in the eyes
Tell a white lie
How I dropped you off at home
And I walked you to the door
Nothin' more
Tomorrow you could say we're just friends
But baby 'til then

We could kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burnin' up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
Yeah, kiss a little more
Kiss a little more
Think a little less

I'll go warm up the truck
If you wanna hop in
Give you a minute or two
Say goodbye to your friends
Ain't gotta go home
But we gotta get goin'
'Cause we've already waited
Way too long to

Kiss a little more
Think a little less
And do the only thing we've been thinkin' 'bout doin'
Since the moment, girl, we met

Yeah, kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burnin' up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
Yeah, kiss a little more
Kiss a little more

Kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burnin' up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
And kiss a little more
Kiss a little more
Think a little less
Yeah, think a little less
Yeah, think a little less
