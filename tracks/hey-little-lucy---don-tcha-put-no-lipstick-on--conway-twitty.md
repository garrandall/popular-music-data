Mmm, baby, when I take you out tonight
Fix your hair, dress up right
Paint your fingertips nice and red
But leave your sweet, sweet lips alone

Little Lucy, don'tcha put no lipstick on
(Little Lucy) don'tcha put no lipstick on
Before the night is through
I'm gonna kiss it right off
Right off of you

Baby, you can wear your French perfume
The pink chenise that rocks the room
But if you want a little old love to bloom
Leave your sweet, sweet lips alone

Little Lucy, don'tcha put no lipstick on
(Little Lucy) don'tcha put no lipstick on
Before the night is through
I'm gonna kiss it right off
Off of you

Baby, do you want the folks to know
How your lips, mmm, thrill me so
Every little kiss we share, we'll show
So leave your sweet, sweet lips alone

Little Lucy, don'tcha put no lipstick on
(Little Lucy) don'tcha put no lipstick on
Before the night is through
I'm gonna kiss it right off
Right off of you

Yeah, Little Lucy
Don'tcha put no lipstick on
Baby, don't you do it...
