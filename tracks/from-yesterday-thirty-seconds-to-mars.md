He's a stranger to some and a vision to none
He can never get enough, get enough of the world
For a fortune, he'd quit
But it's hard to admit how it ends and begins

On his face is a map of the world
A map of the world
On his face is a map of the world
A map of the world


From yesterday, it's coming
From yesterday, the fear
From yesterday, it calls him
But he doesn't want to read the message here


On a mountain he sits, not of gold, but of shit
Through the blood, he can learn, see the life that he took
From a council of one, he'll decide when he's done
With the innocent

On his face is a map of the world
A map of the world
On his face is a map of the world
A map of the world


From yesterday, it's coming
From yesterday, the fear
From yesterday, it calls him

But he doesn't want to read the message
He doesn't want to read the message
He doesn't want to read the message here


On his face is a map of the world


From yesterday, it's coming
From yesterday, the fear
From yesterday, it calls him
But he doesn't want to read the message here


From yesterday, from yesterday
From yesterday, the fear
From yesterday, from yesterday

But he doesn't want to read the message
He doesn't want to read the message
He doesn't want to read the message here
