Her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
I think I wanna marry you

His lips, his lips, I could kiss them all day if he'd let me
His laugh, his laugh, he hates but I think it's so sexy
He's so beautiful and I tell him everyday
I think I wanna marry you

Beautiful girls all over the world
I could be chasing but my time would be wasted
They got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you baby

I'd catch a grenade for ya (this one's for you and me)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (living out our dreams)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (lift my arms out wide) 
You know I'd do anything for ya (I open my eyes)
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
If you walk away, everyday it'll rain, rain, rain

Today I swear I'm not doing anything (I wanna be a billionaire)
I just wanna lay in my bed (so freaking bad)
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

So what we go out, so what we don't sleep
We're just having fun, we don't care who sees
So what we go out, that's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing just the way you are
(I think I wanna marry you) When you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cause you're amazing just the way you are
I think I wanna marry you
Cause you're amazing just the way you are
