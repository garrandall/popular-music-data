Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live oh
Take, take, take it all, but you never give
Should have known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open,
Why were they open?

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked 'cause
What you don't understand is I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah)
Throw my head on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah)

Oh oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya baby
But you won't do the same

No, no, no, no
Black, black, black and blue,
Beat me 'til I'm numb,
Tell the devil I said 'hey' when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman
That's just what you are,
Yeah you'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause what you don't understand is

I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah)
Throw my head on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah)

Oh oh, I would go through all this pain,
Take a bullet straight through my brain,
Yes, I would die for ya baby,
But you won't do the same

If my body was on fire,
Oh you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me you're a liar 'cause you never,
Ever, ever did baby

But darling I'll still catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah)
Throw my head on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah)

Oh oh I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya baby
But you won't do the same
No, you won't do the same
You wouldn't do the same
Oh, you'll never do the same
No, no, no, no
