Who that stocky nigga with the grills? (Trap Lord you're so trill!)
I could get a new Bugatti but a nigga rather chill, rather sit up on the block and stack it 'til I get a mill
What about them old bitches who ain't wanna give me feel? Now they wanna make it gushy cause a nigga got a deal
Rather double up and strap and hit a booty in Brazil (I hit Punta Cana when shit gets so real)
Two bad bitches in my vehicle, yellow hood rats like Pikachu
Hit it from the back got 'em screamin' like "AHHHHHHHH~!!" like Yeezus do
Bringin' rappers from the dead like Jesus do, can't call them bone thugs cause they eatin' dude (yeah)
I (bust-a-rhyme) and (Flipmode), speak the flu, nigga; YAH YAH YAH! - Eat ya crew
Butter pecan, Puerto Rican, be freakin' and peekin', a (Hood Pope) get good throat, I'm skeetin' the sheets
She feelin' my team, I asked her if she feelin' The Weeknd cause a nigga like she give head while you're singin' (HMM)
I'mma get the bread while I'm breathin', I'm the rookie of the year and you better believe it
I be barkin' like a Q like I'm very collegiate! (WOOF! WOOF!) Like a pedigree eatin'


Meetin' up the plug at a QuikTrip (QuikTrip) young nigga had to make that money back flip (BRRRT)
I'm trappin' with accuracy (accuracy) gold on my toilet like Master P (shine)
Lil' mama, she drunk off a daiquiri (who?!) Shabba Ranks my pinky finger, please (SHABBA)
You mad cause you workin' at Mickey D's (hah) young nigga, I'm flexin' like Hercules (flex! FLEX!)
You can take her to the movie and go watch a film (watch a film) A$AP Ferg, front me a pelican (pelican)
Lean, lean, lean -- that's my medicine (lean); Quavo, old money, Sega Genesis (uh)


Takeoff got ten gold rings, bling, bling, bling (bling) for tryna take my rings, gun go bang (pyoo!)
Cashed out on the jeweler (ching); got 'em feelin' like Martin Luther King, (I Had a Dream) (had a dream)
Actavis, I only sip and begin with a beam by extending my clip (BLOAW!)
If I see the police, grab my chips and I dip (DIP) snappin' my fingers, we fillin' arenas (SHABBA) 
I flip up the Hannah Montana in real (WOW!) I feel like that Keyshia Ka'oir
That double AK-47's, they aim at your lip (BLAOW!) Versace, Givenchy, this shit is ridiculous
SHABBA!


Look nigga get it straight you could never fuck with my clique boy!
Awww shit quick hit you with a drop kick jaw (HUH!)
Bone break you could see the way the clock tick tock tick
Money roll these niggas stop bitch boy (HA!)
Bus Rhymes back up in the cockpit spit toxic always givin niggas hot shit boy (HUH!)
Niggas see me shinnin 'til they sick sick sick (UGH!) any bitch really wanna slob dick boy
So much jewelry nigga lookin priceless out here alot of rappin niggas lookin lifeless out here
Kill 'em 'til they say a nigga triflin out here
And you can let 'em talk you know who the nicest out here

Betta get low when yuh hear di shot buss pussy!
Everytime I come you know I body niggas fully (HUH!)
Godfather with it while I learn a little rookie
And I'm diggin in your shorty though her pussy kinda bushy (OH!!!)
Fuckin on the low besides she low go under hoodie (YES!)
Hear horn blow my nigga WAMP WAMP WAMP!!!!
Let it go you already know what's really goody (Goody Goody!)
Kill the shit like I'm some kind of cancer (AHHHH!!!) bag your bitch now she my private dancer (Uh Huh!)
I don't understand why niggas feel like they have to
Ask who the God is when you know what's the answer (Uh Huh!)
Chokehold shit 'til they be callin me strangler (YEAH!)
Hundred million dollar safe behind the plasma (Ok!)
Proper with it 'til they spreadin propaganda (Uh huh!) and when I tick tock and we pop your man up
