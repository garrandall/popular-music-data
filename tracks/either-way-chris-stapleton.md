We pass in the hall on our way to separate rooms
The only time we ever talk is when the monthly bills are due
We go to work, we go to church
We fake the perfect life

I'm past the point of give a damn
All my tears are cried

We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way

It's been so long since I felt
Anything inside these walls
You can't hate, you can't hurt
When you don't feel at all
I used to cry and stay up nights
And wonder what went wrong
And it's been hard
But hearts can only do that for so long

We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
I won't love you either way

We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way
