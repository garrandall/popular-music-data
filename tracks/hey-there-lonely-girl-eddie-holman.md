Hey, there lonely boy, lonely boy
Let me make your broken heart like new
Hey, there lonely boy, lonely boy
Don't you know this lonely girl loves you

Ever since she broke your heart, you seem so lost
Each time you pass my way
Oh, how I long to take your hand and say "Don't cry
I'll kiss your tears away"

Hey, there lonely boy, lonely boy
Let me make your broken heart like new
Hey, there lonely boy, lonely boy
Don't you know this lonely girl loves you

You think that only her two lips can kiss your lips
And make your heart stand still
But once you're in my eyes you'll see
No one can kiss your lips the way I will, the way I will

And hey, there lonely boy, lonely boy
Let me make your broken heart like new
Hey, there lonely boy, my only boy
Don't you know this lonely girl loves you

Hey, there lonely boy, my only boy
Don't you know this lonely girl loves you
(Lonely boy loves you)
