I stand out of sight
And watch as the light from the sun
Shines through her hair

From yonder she came
I don't know her name
Still I love that girl on a swing

Girl on a swing, swing high
Girl on a swing, swing low
Take all the hate from the world that we're in
Girl on a swing, swing high
Girl on a swing, swing low
And you can cast all your troubles to the wind

She comes with the light
Then goes with the night
My heart just yearns
But then comes the dawn
And she returns

Girl on a swing, swing high
Girl on a swing, swing low
Take all the hate from the world that we're in
Girl on a swing, swing high
Girl on a swing, swing low
And you can cast all your troubles to the wind
