Since you've been gone, since you've been unglued
It's hard to figure out your next move
One minute here the next you're gone
Let's make an end to this sad, sad song
For you it's hard to take
'Cause the pill has an awful taste
Just open up and swallow down
Once it hits bottom things may turn around
Unfortunately this is the case
You've got to catch up and win the race
And straighten yourself out
You can do it, you can do it
You can do it, yeah, yeah
Everything you've say has taken long
Enough to say it's a sad, sad song
They can't understand that you mean to do good
I guess you could say you're misunderstood
I know you're meaning well
But you've been shot to hell
Just come back and join us now
'Cause I know that you know how
Unfortunately this is the case
You've got to catch up and win the race
Oh, straighten yourself out
You can do it, you can do it
You can do it, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know it seems they're messing with your mind
But you don't have to go forward blind
So let the bygone be bygone
And let's make and end to this sad, sad song
Unfortunately this is the case
You've got to catch up and win the race
And straighten yourself out
You can do it, you can do it
You can do it, you can do it
You can do it, you can do it
...
