I got a letter from my baby
She said she's comin' home today
I got a letter from my baby
She said she's comin' home today
Oh well, my baby wasn't lyin'
She was comin' home to stay

Sugaree, sugaree
Sugaree, sugaree
Sugaree, sugaree
Don't you know I love you so

I got a pencil and a paper
And I sat right down to write
I got a pencil and a paper
And I sat right down to write
I said I miss you in the daytime
But I miss you more at night

Sugaree, sugaree
Sugaree, sugaree
Sugaree, sugaree
Don't you know I love you so

Oh well, I met her at the station
She had her baggage in her hand
Oh well, I met her at the station
She had her baggage in her hand
I said I love you pretty baby
I'll make you happy if I can

Sugaree, sugaree
Sugaree, sugaree
Sugaree, sugaree
Don't you know I love you so

Sugaree, sugaree
Sugaree, sugaree
Sugaree, sugaree
