Every time I look at you
There's so many things that I want to do
I promise you when I'm ready
That I'll spend my life with you
What is love, is it steady?
'Cause I don't know what to do
So tell me, girl, are you ready
To do what we came to do?


One day we could be together
Cause you know that I wanna be down, baby
But right now, we can all forget it
You know I gots to get around
I don't have much money (don't have no money)
I can't buy a diamond ring (can't buy a diamond thing)
I ain't trying to be funny (funny)
It's only a sexual thing (only a sexual thing)


Can you get with it, it's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can you get with it, it's like that
You ought to love the joy I bring
Can you get with it, it's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can you get with it, it's like that
You ought to love the joy I bring


Please forgive me
'Cause I don't ever want to rush you
I might sound a little hasty
But let's do what we came to do
You know our time is really precious
And you wasted a lot of mine
I'm gonna have to keep on moving
If you can't make up your mind


One day we could be together
Cause you know that I wanna be down, baby
But right now, we can all forget it
You know I gots to get around
I don't have much money (don't have none)
I can't buy a diamond ring (and a diamond ring)
I ain't trying to be funny (no)
It's only a sexual thing


Can you get with it, it's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can you get with it, it's like that
You ought to love the joy I bring
Can you get with it, it's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can you get with it, it's like that
You ought to love the joy I bring


(Baby, do you want to get with it?
I know that you want to)
Yeah, check me out
Yo, watch this
DeVante, say it again
(Can you get with it
With it)


Can you get with it, it's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can you get with it, it's like that
You ought to love the joy I bring
Can you get with it, it's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can you get with it, it's like that
You ought to love the joy I bring
Can you get with it, it's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can you get with it, it's like that
You ought to love the joy I bring
Can you get with it, it's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can you get with it, it's like that
You ought to love the joy I bring
Can you get with it, it's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can you get with it, it's like that
You ought to love the joy I bring
Can you get with it, it's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can you get with it, it's like that
You ought to love the joy I...
