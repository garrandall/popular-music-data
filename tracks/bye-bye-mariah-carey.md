This is for my people who just lost somebody
Your best friend, your baby, your man, or your lady
Put your hands way up high (put âem way up high)
We will never say bye, never, no, no (never say goodbye)
Mommaâs, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins (yeah)
This is for my peoples who lost they grandmothers (yeeeeaaahh)
Lift ya hands to the sky (lift âem way up high), âcause we will never say bye (never say goodbye)


I know, I know youâre gone, I know Iâll see you again
One thing that I can promise, we gonâ meet up again
Hopefully up in heaven, prayinâ that Iâm forgiven
For everything that Iâve done, and that I forgot to mention
If feel so bad to be without my homie
And every since youâve been absent Iâve been so lonely
Why does life cycle around like a trophy
Even though know somebody took the time to warn me
That you canât be with me and itâs just crazy
And everyday Iâm wishinâ that you could come save me
And I know a man ainât supposed to cry
Itâs taken all the strength in my soul to say goodbye


Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye,
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye,
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye,
Bye bye


And you never got the chance to see how good Iâve done
And you never got to see me back at number one
I wish that you were here to celebrate together
I wish that we could spend the holidays together
I remember when you used to tuck me in at night
With the teddy bear you gave to me that I held so tight
I thought you were so strong
That you can make it through whatever
Itâs so hard to accept the fact youâre gone forever
I never knew I could hurt like this
And everyday life goes on like
I wish I could talk to you for awhile
I wish I could find a way try not to cry
As time goes by
And soon as you reach a better place
Still Iâll give the whole world to see your face
And Iâm right here next to you
It feels like you gone too soon
The hardest thing to do is say bye


Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye,
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye,
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye,
Bye bye


Yea, I feel you sweetheart, let me talk to them
Yeah, How come they call it goodbye?
How come the good die?
See I just get high and think of the good times
That I had with my pops, he was a good guy
How come the good die? As i protect my mother
âCause Iâm her oldest son, and there are different worlds
And we in the coldest one, which one did granny go to?
And why do death come? As my baby ask where do babies come from
I tell her where, I tell her why
And I tell her I love her until I tell her bye
And whenever I shall ever die, I hope you celebrate it
I hope you never hate it, and they say heavenâs gated
But I think I know the code, and letâs get your life right
By the end of the road, thatâs why I drive alone down memory lane
So if I crash I hope yaâll remember Wayne, goodbye


I never knew I could hurt like this
And everyday life goes on like
I wish I could talk to you for awhile
I wish I could find a way try not to cry
As time goes by
And soon as you reach a better place
Still Iâll give the whole world to see your face
And Iâm right here next to you
It feels like you gone too soon
The hardest thing to do is say bye


Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye,
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye,
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye,
Bye bye


Itâs hard to say bye, bye, bye, bye
So come on somebody say it with me
Wave ya hands up high,
âCause this is for my peoples who just lost somebody
See this is for everybody, just lift ya hands to the sky
âCause we will never say bye, bye
