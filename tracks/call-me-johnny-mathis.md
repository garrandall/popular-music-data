Call me
If your arms are lonely
Call me
If you're feeling blue
If you don't believe me
Just call and say you need me
And darling I'll come to you

Call me
If your dreams should tumble
I will help you start anew

If you don't believe me
Just call and say you need me
And darling I'll come to you

Call me if thing looks hopeless and gray
I'll come and change the view
Call me when spring seems farthest away
I'll change the seasons for you

Call and say you want me near you
I'll be there before you're though
If you don't believe me
Just call and say you need me
And darling I'll come to you

Call and say you want me near you
I'll be there before you're though
If you don't believe me
Just call and say you need me
And darling I'll fly to you
