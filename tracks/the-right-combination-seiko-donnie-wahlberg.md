Two people together
It was just a dream
Until you came along
My heart was waiting just for you

Tomorrow forever
We both had these promises
For far too long
But now you make the words come true

So touch me now
I need to have you close tonight
And show me how
You can make me feel this way


You and me
We are the right combination
For love (For love)
We're all we need (Oh)

It's just you and me
We make the right combination
Straight from the heart
Love is the key


Can't keep it a secret
Everything I feel
Is written on my face
I can't hide my heart from you

You hold me, it's magic
In your arms
The world becomes a better place
Now I know what love can do

Here we go
Exactly where the road will lead us
I don't know
I just know that you'll be there


You and me
We are the right combination
For love (For love)
We're all we need (Oh)

It's just you and me
We make the right combination
Straight from the heart
Love is the key


And whenever you call
I'm there
Every stairwell to fall
I share
I'll be yours till we love
I care about you, baby

It's so easy to see
So strong
Now I know you and me belong
I'll be by your side forever


You and me
We are the right combination
For love (For love)
We're all we need (Oh)

It's just you and me
We make the right combination
Straight from the heart
Love is the key

Hoo
Hoo, oh, hoo
Oh, oh, oh
