So, so, so scandalous

You're dangerous
Just get it up
The way you move so scandalous
It's all about the two of us
A one night stand just ain't enough
I need some stimulation baby
A little conversation maybe
You got me spinning 'round like crazy
There goes my baby

You know you wanna sing with us (baby)
That's why you know you should be scared of us (baby)

Non stop looks to kill
Straight talk sex appeal
One touch gives me chills and we ain't even close yet
Rough neck all around
Inking all over town
Show me how you get down
Cos we ain't even close yet

You got me feening and you got me feeling weak
Listen as I speak cos I'm careful as I creep
You got me going crazy and you know I can't sleep
No fortune your moves and you hypnotise me
You got me trembling like a little baby girl
You're so special, you're like diamonds and pearls
You got me spinning and you got me in a twirl
You're my number one baby and you come to rock my world

You're dangerous
Just get it up
The way you move so scandalous
It's all about the two of us
A one night stand just ain't enough
I need some stimulation baby
A little conversation maybe
You got me spinning 'round like crazy
There goes my baby

Scandalous (baby)
So scandalous (baby)
Scandalous (baby)
So, so, so scandalous

Hot stuff, head to toe
Where you go, no one knows
You smile playing the dough and we ain't even close yet
Solid as a rock
How many ways can you hit the spot?
Show me what you got 'cos we ain't even close yet

You got me feening and you got me feeling weak
Listen as I speak cos I'm careful as I creep
You got me going crazy and you know I can't sleep
No fortune your moves and you hypnotise me
You got me trembling like a little baby girl
You're so special, you're like diamonds and pearls
You got me spinning and you got me in a twirl
You're my number one baby and you come to rock my world

You're dangerous
Just get it up
The way you move so scandalous
It's all about the two of us
A one night stand just ain't enough
I need some stimulation baby
A little conversation maybe
You got me spinning 'round like crazy
There goes my baby

Scandalous (baby)
So scandalous (baby)
Scandalous (baby)
So, so, so scandalous

A little conversation goes a long, long way
Show a little patience
That you are here to stay
So show me that you're game oh

You're dangerous
Just get it up
The way you move so scandalous
It's all about the two of us
A one night stand just ain't enough
I need some stimulation baby
A little conversation maybe
You got me spinning 'round like crazy
There goes my baby

You're dangerous
Just get it up
The way you move so scandalous
It's all about the two of us
A one night stand just ain't enough
I need some stimulation baby
A little conversation maybe
You got me spinning 'round like crazy
There goes my baby

You know you wanna sing with us (baby)
That's why you know you should be scared of us (baby)
You know you wanna sing with us (baby)
That's why you know you should be scared of us (baby)
