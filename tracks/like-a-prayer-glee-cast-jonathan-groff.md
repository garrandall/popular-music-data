Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home


When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there


I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing


I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying


I close my eyes
Oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me


When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there


I'm like a child
You whisper softly to me


You're in control, just like a child
Now I'm dancing


It's like a dream
No end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream


Let the choir sing
Ooh


When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there


Oh, oh
Oh, oh


Life is a mystery (Oh, oh)
Everyone must stand alone (Oh, oh)
I hear you call my name (Oh, oh)
And it feels like home


Just like a prayer (Oh)
Your voice can take me there (Oh)
Just like a muse to me (Oh)
You are a mystery (Oh)
Just like a dream (Oooh)
You are not what you seem


(Oh!)


Just like a prayer
No choice, your voice can take me (There)


Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (Like a prayer) (I'll take you there!)
It's like a dream to me (Ohh)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (Yeah, I'll take you there!)
It's like a dream to me (Just like a dream to me)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (Ohh!)
It's like a dream to me (Like a dream, like a dream)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there!)
It's like a dream to me (Oooh, yeah!)


Life is a mystery (Just like a prayer)
Everyone must stand alone (Your voice can take me there)


(Oooh)


I hear you call my name (I hear it call)
And it feels like home


Just like a prayer (Just like) (Ooh)
Your voice can take me there (A prayer) (Ooh)
Just like a muse to me (Your voice can take me there)
You are a mystery (Take you there, take you there)


Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer (Oh, woah)
No choice, your voice can take me there (Yeah)
Just like a prayer (Yeah, yeah)
Your voice can take me there (Oooh)


Just like a dream (Just like)
You are not what you seem (A prayer)
Just like a prayer


No choice, your voice can take me there (Yeah)
