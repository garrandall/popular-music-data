If a girl is in love with you
And she says she'll make the whole world seem new
If you think that this she could never do
You don't know girls

If a girl is in love with you
And she says she'll make the whole world seem new
If you think that this she could never do
You don't know girls

If a girl says that in her eyes
You're the one where all of her future lies
If you think she tells it to all the guys
You don't know girls

But I promise you (but I promise you)
That I'll make you know (that I'll make you know)
What a girl can be (what a girl can be)
'Cause I love you so ('cause I love you so)

I'll be part of your every day
'Cause I know with you I will always stay
And my love you never again will say
You don't know girls

(Doo wah doo wah doo wah doo wah)

I'll be part of your every day
'Cause I know with you I will always stay
And my love you never again will say
You don't know girls
You don't know girls
