Don't let the sun catch you crying
Crying at my front door
You done daddy dirty
He sure don't want you no more


Don't let the sun catch you lying
Lying at my front door
Daddy's done turned salty
And baby, you made him so sore


You can cry, cry, cry
Yes baby, you can wail
Beat your head on the pavement
Till the man comes and throws you in jail








Whoa, you know you done me dirty now
And i just don't want you no more
