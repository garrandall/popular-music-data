Well, I won't back down
No, I won't back down
You can stand me up at the gates of hell
But I won't back down


No, I'll stand my ground
Won't be turned around
And I'll keep this world from draggin' me down
Gonna stand my ground
And I won't back down


I won't back down
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
I won't back down
Hey I will stand my ground
And I won't back down


Well I know what's right
I got just one life
In a world that keeps on pushin' me around
But I stand my ground
And I won't back down


I won't back down
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
I won't back down
Hey, I will stand my ground
And I won't back down
I won't back down
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
I won't back down
Hey, I will stand my ground
And I won't back down
No, I won't back down
