Last night I had the strangest dream
I sailed away to China
In a little rowboat to find you
And you said you had to get your laundry cleaned
Didn't want no one to hold you
What does that mean?
And you said


Ain't nothing gonna break my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no
I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothing gonna break-a my stride
I'm running
And I won't touch ground
Oh no
I got to keep on moving


You're on a roll and now you pray it'll last
The road behind was rocky
But now you're feeling cocky
You look at me and you see your past
Is that the reason
Why you're running so fast?
And she said


Ain't nothing gonna break-a my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no
I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride
I'm running
And I won't touch ground
Oh no
I got to keep on moving


(Never let another girl like you)
Work me over
(Never let another girl like you)
Drag me under
(If I meet another girl like you)
I will tell her
(Never want another girl like you)
Have to say
Oh


Ain't nothing gonna break-a my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no, oh no
I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride
I'm running
And I won't touch ground
Oh no
I got to keep on moving


Ain't nothing gonna break-a my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no, oh no
I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothing gonna break-a my stride
I'm running
And I won't touch ground
Oh no
I got to keep on moving


(Whoaaaaa)
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no
I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothing gonna break-a my stride
I'm running
And I won't touch ground
Oh no
I got to keep on moving
