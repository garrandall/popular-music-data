(Once you have found her never let her go)
(Once you have found her never let her go)

Some enchanted evening
You may see a stranger
You may see a stranger
Across a crowded room
And somehow you know
You know even then
That somewhere you'll see her
Again and again

Some enchanted evening (some enchanted evening)
Someone may be laughing (someone may be laughing)
You may hear her laughing
Across a crowded room
And night after night
As strange as it seems
The sound of her laughter will
Sing in your dreams

(Some enchanted evening you may see a stranger)
(You may see a stranger)
Across a crowded room
Then run to her arms
And make her your own
Or all through your life
You may dream all alone

(Once you have found her never let her go)
(Once you have found her never let her go)
Never let her go
