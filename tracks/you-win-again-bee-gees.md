I couldn't figure why
You couldn't give me what everybody needs
I shouldn't let you kick me when I'm down
My baby
I find out everybody know that
You've been using me
I'm surprised
You let me stay around you
One day I'm gonna lift the cover
And look inside your heart
We gotta level before we go
And tear this love apart


There's no fight you can't fight
This battle of love with me
You win again
So little time
We do nothing but compete
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
You win again
Some never try
But if anybody can, we can
And I'll be (I'll be) I'll be (I'll be)
Following you

Oh, girl


Oh baby I shake you from now on
I'm gonna break down your defenses
One by one
I'm gonna hit you from all sides
Lay your fortress open wide
Nobody stops this body from
Taking you
You better beware, I swear
I'm gonna be there one day when you fall
I could never let you cast aside
The greatest love of all


There's no fight you can't fight
This battle of love with me
You win again
So little time
We do nothing but compete
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
You win again
Some never try
But if anybody can, we can
And I'll be (I'll be) I'll be (I'll be)
Following you
Oh, girl


You win again
So little time
We do nothing but compete
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
You win again
Some never try
But if anybody can, we can
And I'll be (I'll be) I'll be (I'll be)
Following you
Oh.. oh girl


You win again
So little time
We do nothing but compete
There's no life on earth
(No life)
No other could see me through
(No other could, no other could)
You win again
Some never try
But if anybody can, we can

There's no fight you can't fight
This battle of love with me
(This battle of love)
You win again
So little time
We do nothing but compete
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through
