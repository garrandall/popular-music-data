Wake up, Mr. West

And I heard 'em say,
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today.
From the Chi, like Tim it's a harder way,
So this is in the name of love, like Robert say

Before you ask me to go get a job today,
Can I at least get a raise on the minimum wage?
And I know the government administer AIDS,
So I guess we just pray like the minister say,

AllÄhu Akbar
And throw 'em some hot cars,
The things we see on the screen that's not ours,
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far

Where I'm from,
The dope boys is the rock stars,
But they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars,
I guess they want us all behind bars.
I know it.

Uh, and I heard 'em say,
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today.
And I heard 'em say,
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today.
(Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today.)
But we'll find a way
(And nothing last forever but be honest babe,
It hurts but it may be the only way)

They say people in your life are seasons,
And anything that happen is for a reason,
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezin',
And Gran keep prayin' and keep believin'
In Jesus and one day that you see him,
'Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him,

The devil is alive I feel him breathin',
Claimin' money is the key so keep on dreamin',
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us,
My aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down,
So now my little cousin's smoking them cigarettes now,
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now,
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out...
I'm sick of it now

Uh, and I heard 'em say,
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today.
And I heard 'em say,
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today.
(Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today.)
But we'll find a way
(And nothing last forever but be honest babe,
It hurts but it may be the only way)

With every worthless word we get more far away,
And nothing's ever promised tomorrow today,
And nothing last forever but be honest babe,
It hurts but it may be the only way
