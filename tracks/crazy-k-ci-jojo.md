(I don't know why, what I'm doing what I'm doing)
See, baby I, apologize
For all the things that I've done that I've done
See I've known that I've been a fool for far too long
And baby you have it, I go around to wait, just come back to papa
Please baby, baby won't you stay
If you really love me then why are you leavin me

I can't think, think about this crazy day
I lose sleep just to daydream about you babyyyyyyyy
I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy, just to thinkin about you lately (crazy baby)
I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy, just to thinkin about you baby (I don't know what to do)
I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, thinkin about you lately (crazy, crazy, crazy)
I'm going crazy, crazy, (crazy, crazy) when I can touch you
Crazy, crazy (I'm going crazy) when I can hold you
Crazy, crazy, (I'm going crazy) when I can see you again
(Said I'm going crazy)

(Said I'm going crazy)
I've finally realized, that you are my true love
And I had a lot of time to think, and you're all seem to keep thinking, 
To keep thinkin of, yeahhh
And now I know I need you each and every day
I can't live without you, so don't run away
Baby you say that you love me, so why'd u leave me, why (why, why, why, why)

I can't think, think about this crazy day
I lose sleep just to daydream about you baby (I'm going crazy)
I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy, just to thinkin about you lately (just to think)
I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy, just to thinkin about you baby
(I'm goin crazy, I'm going crazy)
I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, thinkin about you lately 
I'm going crazy, crazy, (crazy, crazy) but I can't touch you (I'm going crazy)
Crazy, crazy (crazy, crazy), when I can hold you
Crazy, crazy, when I can see again (if I can see you, if I can see you if I can see you, if I can see you)
If I can see you, if I can see you again
Then I would go, if I could see you again
I'd go craeeae
