It's a Friday, we finally made it
I can't believe I get to see your face
You've been working and I've been waiting
To pick you up and take you from this place

Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
Like only we can
Like only we can
Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
I'm coming up and I'm loving every minute of it

You be the DJ, I'll be the driver
You put your feet up in the getaway car
I'm flying fast like a, a wanted man
I want you, baby, like you can't understand

Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
We found a message in a bottle we were drinking
Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
I hate your guts 'cause I'm loving every minute of it

I gotta leave ya, it's gonna hurt me
My clothes are dirty and my friends are getting worried
Down there below us, under the clouds
Baby, take my hand and pull me down, down, down, down
And I'll be dreamin' of the next time we can go
Into another serotonin overflow

Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
I'm busted up but I'm loving every minute of it
(Love on the weekend, love on the weekend)

I'm looking for a little love
I'm looking for a little love, oh yeah
(Love on the weekend, love on the weekend)
