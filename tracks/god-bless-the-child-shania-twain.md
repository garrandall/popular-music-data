Hallelujah, hallelujah
God bless the child who suffers
Hallelujah, hallelujah
God bless the young without mothers
This child is homeless
That child's on crack
One plays with a gun
While the other takes a bullet in his back
This boy's a beggar
That girl sells her soul
They both work the same street
The same hell hole

Hallelujah, hallelujah
God bless the child who suffers
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Let every man help his brother

Some are born addicted and some are just thrown away
Some have daddies who make them play games they don't want to play

But with hope and faith
We must understand
All God's children need is love
And us to hold their little hands

This boy is hungry, he ain't got enough to eat
That girl's cold and she ain't got no shoes on her feet

When a child's spirit's broken
And feels all hope is gone
God help them find the strength to carry on

But with hope and faith
Yea, we can understand
All God's children need is love
And us to hold their little hands

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Let us all love one another
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Make all our hearts blind to color
Hallelujah, hallelujah
God bless the child who suffers
