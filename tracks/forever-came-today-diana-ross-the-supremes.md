Forever came today
Diana ross & the supremes
(Brian holland/lamont dozier/edward holland, jr.)
There you were
Standing there
As your eyes reached out to me
Something warm in your eyes
Touched my heart right then and there
All the love i never knew
I found in you
Suddenly
My world stood still
My life was then forfilled
As you gently touched my hand
I knew that we had laying a plan
For everlasting love
That i been forever dreaming of
At last
Ooh, at last
My forever came today (my forever came today)
When you walked into my life (when you walked into my life)
And made my lonely life
A paradise (a paradise)
It came today
Forever came today
As we were standing there
You didn't speak a single word
But your eyes
Your eyes said you wanted me
Your touch said you needed me
And my heart said tenderly
Darling
Ooh, my darling
Make me yours
Let your kiss touch my face
And tell me love has let me
To this place to your warm embrace
And our hapiness
Thanks to you my search has ended
And i want the world to see
How gently love has shined on me
With everlasting love
That i been forever dreaming of
At last
Ooh, at last
My forever came today (my forever came today)
When you walked into my life (when you walked into my life)
And made my lonely life
A paradise (a paradise)
It came today
Forever came today
At last
Ooh, at last
My forever came today (my forever came today)
When you walked into my life (when you walked into my life)
And made my lonely life
A paradise (a paradise)
Oh, it came today
Forever came today
At last
Ooh, at last
My forever came today (my forever came today)
When you walked into my life...
