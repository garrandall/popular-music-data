Do you remember, oh the night that we first met
The moment I looked in your eyes I never will forget
Do you remember oh the time that we first kissed
Remember thinking to myself could it really be like this

And we danced beneath the midnight moon
Whoa! I took one look
One look at you
And I fell in love before I knew
And the night stood still
And like a breeze we moved cool and slow
To the rhythm of the radio
And I reached out for you and held you close
And the night stood still

I still remember how our song was playing then
And if I close my eyes I swear
That we'd be there again
Do you remember oh the way it used to be
Where we were two hearts on the run
So young so wild and free

And we danced beneath the midnight moon
Whoa! I took one look
One look at you
And I fell in love before I knew
And the night stood still
And like a breeze we moved cool and slow
To the rhythm of the radio
And I reached out for you and held you close
And the night stood still

Girl the night stood still
We danced
Danced
We fell in love
We fell in love

Do you remember oh the way it used to be...
Where we were two hearts on the run
So young so wild and free

And we danced beneath the midnight moon
Whoa! I took one look
One look at you
And I fell in love before I knew
And the night stood still
And like a breeze we moved cool and slow
To the rhythm of the radio
And I reached out for you and held you close
And the night stood still

And we danced beneath the midnight moon
Whoa! I took one look
One look at you
And I fell in love before I knew
And the night stood still
And like a breeze we moved cool and slow
To the rhythm of the radio
And I reached out for you and held you close
And the night stood still
