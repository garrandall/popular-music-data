That's what I told a girl one time
I'm coming back to getcha one day
I want you to put it in a layaway


Go and put your loving in the layaway
Coming back to get it on another day, yeah
Don't have to worry about getting away, yeah yeah
Well, your love is safe in the layaway

Hey, hey, hey, hey, layaway
(In the layaway)
Everybody's got someone they wanna keep safe away
(Keep safe away)
Everybody needs someone to love on a rainy day
(On a rainy way)
Ah, putting your love in the lay away (In the layaway)

Well, I got to hold, hold on to my receipt
(Keep on holding on)

(Keep on holding on)
Your love and kisses makes me feel complete
(Keep on holding on)
