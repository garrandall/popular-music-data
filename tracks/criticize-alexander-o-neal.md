Oh-oh
(You don't realise)
(I just want what is right)
(Still the same)

(Criticise)

Can't you find something not to talk about

Is this only when you sing

Makes you look better when you put things down
Value your opinion
Don't criticise my friends
Criticise my ideas
Don't crticise my lifestyle
I'm fed up cos all you wanna do is criticise

(Don't just close your mind)
Oh-oh
(You don't realise)
(I just want what is right)

(Still the same)
(Criticise)
Now can't we talk this over
Cos your conversation aint right
We can make our love stronger
You don't have to think twice

Don't criticise my friends
Criticise my ideas

Don't criticise my lifestyle

I'm fed up 'cause all you wanna do is criticise

(Don't just close your mind)
Oh-oh
Criticise
(You don't realise)
All you wanna do is criticise
(I just want what is right)
(Still the same)
Criticise
(Don't just close your mind)
All you wanna do is criticise
Oh-oh
Criticise
(You don't realise)
All you wanna do is criticise
(I just want what is right)
(Still the same)
(Criticise)
Criticise
(Don't just close your mind)
All you wanna do is criticise
Oh-oh
Criticise
(You don't realise)
All you wanna do is criticise
(I just want what is right)
(Still the same)
Criticise
(Don't just close your mind)
All you wanna do is criticise
Oh-oh
Criticise
(You don't realise)
All you wanna do is criticise
(I just want what is right)
(Don't just close your mind)
Gotta be your man
Can't stop me baby
