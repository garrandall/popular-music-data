Now, here comes the music

Okay, all you need is some patience and a little practice
And you'll soon be disco dancing with the best
Let's start with the basic two-beat turn
I'll count it for you like this

Step left, around and together with the right
Step left, around and-and and together with the right

Act like the end of the record and fade out
All that childish stuff is just played out
Kill the noise and the instruction
Now's the time for a brief introduction

Feed me the beat, glad to meet ya
Fancy moves and steps how I greet ya
Side to side, jump, step and turn
Set the fire boys and let's burn

Step left, around and together with the right
Stand straight, bend knees, thrust hips
Step left, around and together with the right
Step forward, kick, step right and back

Stop the talk, man, you're a distraction
You can chill but I'm not relaxing
I came here to turn up the party
Socialize and Coke and Bacardi

Drop my drink then flees to the dance floor
Show the DJ what I came here for
Lose control just like a wild animal
Eat the beat like a hungry cannibal

Dance (Doo doo doo-doo-doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo)
Dance (Doo doo doo-doo-doo doo, show me how to dance)
Dance (Doo doo doo-doo-doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo)
Dance (Doo doo doo-doo-doo doo, show me how to dance)

Ready, set and begin
Step left, around and together with the right
Stand straight (Now man), bend knees, thrust hips
(You gotta get with the new steps, boy)
Step left, around and together with the right
Step forward, kick, step right and back

Show you how to dance is like sex
Start up dry and end up all wet
From the moves and all of the action
The result is a pure satisfaction

Music pumps, your partner is ready
Keep the beat and you move steady
I'm here to show you how
Hit the floor and (Dance now)

Step left, around and together with the right
Stand straight, bend knees, thrust hips
Step left, around and together with the right
Step forward, kick, step right and

Dance (Doo doo doo-doo-doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo)
Dance (Doo doo doo-doo-doo doo, show me how to dance)
Dance (Doo doo doo-doo-doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo)
Dance (Doo doo doo-doo-doo doo, show me how to dance)

(Ow, ooh ah, ooh ah cha, ooh ah, ooh ah ow)
Get on your feet and dance to the beat and (Ow)
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance

Dance (Dance), party people, come along
Dance (Dance), get down to this funky song
Dance (Dance), feel the rhythm, stomp your feet
Dance now, check it out (Dance) and

Dance (Doo doo doo-doo-doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo)
Dance (Doo doo doo-doo-doo doo, show me how to dance)
Dance (Doo doo doo-doo-doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo-doo)
Dance (Doo doo doo-doo-doo doo, show me how to dance)

Well, that's it
Good luck and keep on dancing
