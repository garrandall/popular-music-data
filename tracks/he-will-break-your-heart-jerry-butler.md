He don't love you like I love you
If he did, he wouldn't break your heart
He don't love you like I love you
He's try-in' to tear us apart


Fare thee well, I know you're leavin'
(I know you're leavin')
For the new love that you've found
The handsome guy that you've been dating, whoa
I got a feelin' he's gonna put you down 'cause


He don't love you like I love you
If he did, he wouldn't break your heart
He don't love you like I love you
He's try-in' to tear us apart


He uses all the great quotations
Says the things I wish I could say
Whoa, but he's has so many rehearsals
Girl, to him it's just another play but wait


When the final act is over
And you're left standing all alone
When he takes his bow and makes his exit
Girl, I'll be there to take you home


He don't love you (and he never will) like I love you
If he did, he wouldn't break your heart
Oh, he don't love you, girl, like I love you
He's try-in' to tear us apart


Whoa, he don't love you
