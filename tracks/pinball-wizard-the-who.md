Ever since I was a young boy
I've played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all
But I ain't seen nothin' like him
In any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball

He stands like a statue
Becomes part of the machine
Feelin' all the bumpers
Always playing clean
He plays by intuition
The digit counters fall
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball

He's a pinball wizard
There has to be a twist
A pinball wizard
Got such a supple wrist

How do you think he does it?
I don't know
What makes him so good?

He ain't got no distractions
Can't hear those buzzers and bells
Don't see lights a-flashin'
He plays by sense of smell
Always has a replay
And never tilts at all
That deaf dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball

He can't beat me now
I've always been the champ
I know every trick
No freak's gonna beat my hand

Even at my favorite table
He can beat my best
His disciples lead him in
And he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers
I've never seen him fall
That deaf dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball

He's a pinball wizard
There has to be a twist
A pinball wizard
Got such a supple wrist

He's a pinball wizard
He's scoring even more
A pinball wizard
For the girls who dig pinball lore
He's scoring more
He's scoring more

I thought I was
The bally table king
But I just handed my
Pinball crown to him
To him
To him!
