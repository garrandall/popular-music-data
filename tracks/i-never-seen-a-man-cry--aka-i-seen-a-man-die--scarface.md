So what you gonna do when you get outta' here cat da'
Face: I don't know, tryin' to live it one day at a time you know
(Cough, cough)I here you talkin' man, live it one day at a time it ain't nothin' but a thang tho bro'
Face: Yeah, I here you fool well let me get up outta here my ride out here waitin' for me
A'ight catty take it easy baby
Face: Stay up fool

Verse 1:
He greets his father with his hands up
Rehabilitated slightly, glad to be the mans child
The world is different since he seen it last
Outta jail been seven years and he's happy that he's free at last
All he had was his mother's letters
Now he's mobile and he's gotta make a changed and make it for the better
But he's black so he's got one strike against him
And he's young plus he came up in the system
But he's smart and he's finally makin' eighteen
And his goal's to get on top and try to stay clean
So he's callin' up his homie who done came up
Livin' lavish now they dealin' wit' the same stuff
And had that attitude that who he was was worth man
And with that fucked up attitude he killed his first man
Now its different he done did dirt
And realized killin' men meant comin' up
But it still hurt
And can't nobody change this
It's 1994 and we up against the same shit
I never understood why
I could never see a man cry
Until I see a man die

Chorus:
Face: A man cry

Verse 2:
Imagine life at its full peak
Then imagine lyin' dead in the arms of your enemy
Imagine peace on this earth where there's no grief
Imagine grief on this earth where there's no peace
Everybody's got a different way of endin' it
And when your number comes for souls then they send it in
Now your time has arrived for your final test
(I see the fear in your eyes and in your final breath)
How much longer will it be 'till its all done?
Total darkness at ease be it all one
I watch him dying when he dies, let us celibrate
You took his life but your memory you'll never take
You'll be headed to another place
And the life you used to live will reflect in your momma's face
I still gotta' wonder why
I never seen a man cry
Untill I seen a man die

Chorus: 2x

I hear you breathin' but your heart no longer sounds strong
But you're kinda scared of diein' so you hold on
And you keep on blackin' out and your pulse is low
Stop tryin' to fight the reap but just relax and let it go
Because theres no way you can fight it but you'll still try
And you can try it till you fight it but you'll still die
Your spirit leaves your body and your mind clears
The rigimore starts to set now you're outta' here
You start your journey into outer space
You see yourself in the light but you still feelin' outta' place
So you're standin' in the tunnel of eternal life
And you see the ones you never learned to love in life
Make the choice let it go and you can back it up
If you ain't at peace with God you need to patch it up
But if you're ready close your eyes and we can set it free
There lies a man not scared to die may he rest in peace
I still got to wonder why
I never seen a man cry
'Till I seen that man die

Chorus: 3x (fades out)

(Tv flipping channels, dishes clashing)
