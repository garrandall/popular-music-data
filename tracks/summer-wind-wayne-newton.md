The summer wind, came blowin' in from across the sea
It lingered there, to touch you hair and walk with me
All summer long, we sang a song and strolled the golden sand
Two sweethearts, and the summer wind

Like painted kites, the days and nights went flyin' by
The world was new, beneath a blue umbrella sky
Then softer than, a piper man one day it called to you
And I lost you, to the summer wind

The autumn wind, and the winter winds have come and gone
And still the days, the lonely days go on and on
And guess who sighs his lullabies through nights that never end
Well my fickle friend, the summer wind

That old summer wind
Talkin' 'bout the summer wind
The summer wind
