If you want to hang on to my shoulder
I'm standing here
If you want to do it all over
Let me get near
If you were another pretender
Oh I'd pass you by
If you were a lost weekender
Oh maybe I'd try

When you gonna give me something to grab for
When you gonna put it in my sight
When you gonna give me something to grab for
When you gonna show me what it's like

If you want to talk about it
I got the time
When you're looking so enchanted
You cover my mind
If you think I'll wait forever
Oh maybe you're right
There's no such thing as now or never
There's only twilight

When you gonna give me something to grab for
When you gonna put it in my sight
Oh give me something to grab for
When you gonna show me
Show me what it's like

If you want to think it over
Oh I'll just wait around
If you want to take me over
I won't turn you down

When you gonna give me something to grab for
When you gonna put it in my sight
C'mon and give me something to grab for
You gotta show me what it's like
Show me what it's like

When you gonna give me something to grab for
You gotta put it in my sight
Oh give me something to grab for
You gotta show me what it's like

Give me something to grab for
Show me what it's like
You gotta give me something to grab for
Oh give me something to grab for
Show me what it's like
Show me what it's like
Show me what it's like
