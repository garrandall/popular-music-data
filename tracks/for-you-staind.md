To my mother, to my father
It's your son or, it's your daughter
Are my screams, loud enough for
You to hear me, should I turn this up for you


I sit here locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence, gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast


Your silence, is what kills me
I need someone, here to help me
But you don't know, how to listen
And let me make, my decisions


I sit here locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence, gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast


All your insults, and your curses
Make me feel like I'm not a person
And I feel like, I am nothing
But you made me, so do something
'Cause I'm fucked up, because you are
Need attention, attention you couldn't give


'Cause I sit here locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence, gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast
I sit here locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence, gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast
