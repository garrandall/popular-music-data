What's goin' on with the sun and the moon
'Cause one's goin' down to early, one's comin' up to soon
The hands on my old clock tell me once again that I'm fallin' behind
There's too much to do and not enough time

Keepin' up, I'm movin' as fast as I can
Keepin' up, in a circle that never ends
I can't stop like it or not I'm stuck
It's runnin' me to death and I'm out of my breath keepin' up

There's no such thing for me as a nine to five
It takes more sweat than that just to get us by
It's like I'm chasin' my own tail
'Cause Monday mornin' starts another stressed out week
The world is breathing down my neck I can feel the heat

Keepin' up, I'm movin' as fast as I can
Keepin' up, in a circle that never ends
I can't stop like it or not I'm stuck
It's runnin' me to death and I'm out of my breath keepin' up

By the time we make ends meet
There's not much left for you and me
And no job security
It sure makes it tough

Keepin' up
Keepin' up
I can't stop like it or not I'm stuck
It's runnin' me to death and I'm out of my breath keepin' up

I'm movin' as fast as I can
Keepin' up, in a circle that never ends
Keepin' up
I can't stop
Keepin' up, like it or not

Keepin' up, I'm movin' as fast as I can
Keepin' up, in a circle that never ends
Keepin' up
I can't stop
Keepin' up, like it or not
Keepin' up...
