Yeah
NLE, top shotta
Baby Mexico we chop 'em
Yeah, what we on Blueface?
How we comin'?
Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I am a menace, keep me a rack just like tennis
I'm with the shit like I'm Dennis
I started this shit I'ma finish
Niggas be hatin', tryna blemish my image
Who want the smoke? .223 came with the scope
Extended clip long as a rope
We wipe his nose, just like he had him a cold
I knew that boy was a ho

Pull up with the gang, you know that we bangin'
What is your set, nigga? What is you claimin'?
I am a beast, you cannot tame it
Don't point the finger, this shit can get dangerous
These niggas hatin', these niggas plottin'
Ooh, he got money? I'm runnin' his wallet
You say you a killer, lil' nigga stop it
In a shoot out your gun was droppin'
You really a ho
You pull up, I let that bitch blow
And just like some tissue, we wipin' yo nose
I was on stage with the strap at my show
If you playin' my bro, put a tag on yo' toe
Run a nigga up, send 'em straight to the doctor
Two bullets in his chest make a fuck nigga holla
I'm a big dog, Great Dane, nigga you a toddler
Bitch nigga, you my son so they make me a father

I am a menace, keep me a rack just like tennis
I'm with the shit like I'm Dennis
I started this shit I'ma finish
Niggas be hatin', tryna blemish my image
Who want the smoke? .223 came with the scope
Extended clip long as a rope
We wipe his nose, just like he had him a cold
I knew that boy was a ho (Huh?)


Blueface, baby
Yeah, yeah, aight!
Bitch, I'm a Loc, MAC with the scope
I am big homie, one phone call they go
Pick the wrong side, Glock put him court side
Now he watchin' this shoot from the flo'
Ooh, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, let me switch the flow
Choppa got a choppa, make a wrong move, bet he pop ya'
Bitch call me daddy, bitch call me papa
That boy baloney, bitch, I be yeah
You now if I hit it, then it was on camera
Hopped off the bus then hopped in a Porsche (Panamera)
Four G's sittin' on a four piece with a biscuit
I play with fire, sometimes I burn bridges
Bet you ain't ever met a nigga love swimmin'
Pull up like Tracy McGrady from the Pistons
Gotta keep a pistol for a fuck nigga dissin'
Bet this choppa make him dance like a disco


I am a menace, keep me a rack just like tennis
I'm with the shit like I'm Dennis
I started this shit I'ma finish
Niggas be hatin', tryna blemish my image
Who want the smoke? .223 came with the scope
Extended clip long as a rope
We wipe his nose, just like he had him a cold
I knew that boy was a ho

I might just OD, percs killin' me slowly
Feelin' like I'm Kobe, kay net nigga hold me
If you wanna run up on me, shoot 'em like Ginobili
And I'm with the shit lil' homie, yeah, like I'm Toby, yeah
And I'm with the shit lil' homie, yeah, like I'm Toby, yeah, bitch!
Like I'm Toby
...
... if let ...
Like a school shooter named Toby

Keep out ...
...
Keep out ...
...
Keep out ...
