Well, it feels alright
An' everything is really okay
Well, it feels alright
An' everything is really okay

Well, and the love of my baby
Make me feel this way

Well, she got great big legs
And the cutest little feet
Yeah, she got great big legs
Man, and the cutest little feet

Hey, she upsets everybody
Everyone she meet
Alright, look out
Well, help me somebody
Look out, baby

I love ya, baby
Sweet like Heaven up above
Well, I love ya, baby
Sweet like Heaven up above

Well, I pray to the Lord
You're the only one I love
