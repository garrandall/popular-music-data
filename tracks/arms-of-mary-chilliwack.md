The light shines down the valley
The wind blows up the alley
Oh, and I wish I was lying in the arms of Mary

She took the pains of boyhood
And turned them into feel good
Oh, and I wish was lying in the arms of Mary

Mary was the girl who taught me all I had to know
She put me right on the first mistake
Summer wasn't gone and I'd learned all she had to show
She really gave all a boy could take, yeah

So now, when I get lonely
Still looking for the one and only
That's when I wish I was lying in the arms of Mary

Mary was the girl who taught me all I had to know
She put me right on the first mistake
Summer wasn't gone and I'd learned all she had to show
She really gave all a boy could take

Mary was the girl who taught me all I had to know
She put me right on the first mistake
Summer wasn't gone and I'd learned all she had to show
She really gave all a boy could take, yeah

The light shines down the valley
The wind blows up the alley
Oh, and I wish I was lying in the arms of Mary
Oh, and I wish I was lying in the arms of Mary
