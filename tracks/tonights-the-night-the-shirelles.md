You said you're gonna meet me (tonight's the night)
Tonight's the night (tonight's the night)
You said you're gonna kiss me (tonight's the night)
Tonight's the night (tonight's the night)
Well, I don't know
Said I don't know right now
I might love you so (tonight's the night)

You say you're gonna beg me (tonight's the night)
Turn the lights down low (tonight's the night)
You said you're gonna make me (tonight's the night)
Feel all aglow (tonight's the night)
Well, I don't know
Well, I don't know right now
I might love you so (tonight's the night)

I might love you so much
You may break my heart
I may want you so much
And all my dream's been torn apart

You say you're gonna love me (tonight's the night)
Tonight's the night (tonight's the night)
You say you're gonna hold me (tonight's the night)
Tonight's the night (tonight's the night)
Well, I don't know
Said I don't know right now
I might love you so (tonight's the night)

Let's take a chance (tonight's the night)
Gonna be a great romance (tonight's the night)
Feelin' good right now (tonight's the night)
Gonna be a great romance (tonight's the night)
Upsettin' my goals (tonight's the night)
Gonna be a great romance (tonight's the night)
