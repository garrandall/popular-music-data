Sheâd rather wear a pair of cut-off jeans than a fancy evening dress, 
And with her windows rolled down and her hair all blown around, sheâs a hot southern mess... 
Sheâll take a beer over white wine and a campfire over candle light, 
And when it comes to love, oh her idea of a romantic night... 

Is listeninâ to old Alabama, drivin' through Tennessee... 
A little Dixieland Delight at the Right Time of the Night, 
And she canât keep her hands off of me-ee-eee! 

And now weâre rollinâ down an old back road, 
I got the steering wheel in one hand... 
Weâll find a hideaway where she and I can play, 
In Mother Natureâs band... 

Now weâre listeninâ to old Alabama, parked somewhere in Tennessee... 
A little Dixieland Delight and It Feels So Right, 
And Itâs Love In The First Degree-ee-eee! 

Forget about Sinatra or Coltrane, or some olâ Righteous Brothers song, 
And Barry White ainât gonna work tonight, if you really wanna turn her on; 
Play some back home come on music that comes from the heart, 
Play something with lots of feeling, âcause thatâs where music has to startâ¦ 

Now weâre listenin' to Old Alabama, and weâre drivin' through Tennessee, 
A little Dixieland Delight and It Feels So Right and its Love in the First Degree... 

Yeahâ you know weâre listenin' to Old Alabama (old Alabama) drivin' through Tennessee (Tennessee) 
A little Why Lady Why at The Right Time of The Night 
Oh and she canât keep her hands off of me-ee-eee 

Oh, play me some old Alabama, 
Oh, play me some old Alabama... 
Wonât you play me some old Alabama, 
Play me some old Alabama... 
Wonât you pla-ee-ay-ay 
yeee-haw!!!
