She’d rather wear a pair of cutoff jeans
Than a fancy evening dress
And with her windows rolled down and her hair all blown around, she’s a hot southern mess
She’ll take a beer over white wine
And a campfire over candle light
And when it comes to love, oh her idea of a romantic night


Is listening to old Alabama, driving through Tennessee
A little Dixieland Delight at the Right Time of the Night
And she can’t keep her hands off of me-ee-Eee!


And now we’re rolling down an old back road
I got the steering wheel in one hand
We’ll find a hideaway where she and I can play
In Mother Nature’s band


Now we’re listening to old Alabama
Parked somewhere in Tennessee
A little Dixieland Delight and It Feels So Right
And It’s Love In The First Degree-ee-Eee!


Forget about Sinatra or Coltrane
Or some old Righteous Brothers song
And Barry White is not going to work tonight
If you really want to turn her on
Play some back home come on music
That comes from the heart
Play something with lots of feeling
Because that’s where music has to start


Now we’re listening to Old Alabama
And we’re driving through Tennessee
A little Dixieland Delight and It Feels So Right
And its Love in the First Degree

Yeah’ you know we’re listening to Old Alabama (old Alabama) driving through Tennessee (Tennessee)
A little Why Lady Why at The Right Time of The Night
Oh and she can’t keep her hands off of me-ee-Eee


Oh, play me some old Alabama
Oh, play me some old Alabama
Won’t you play me some old Alabama
Play me some old Alabama
Won’t you play-ee-ay-ay
Yeee-haw!
