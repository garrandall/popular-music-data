Whoaaaaaaa


Scotty doesn't know
That Fiona and me do it in my van every Sunday
She tells him she's in church, but she doesn't go
Still, she's on her knees, and


Scotty doesn't know
Oh, Scotty doesn't know-ow
So don't tell Scotty
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
(So don't tell Scotty!)


Fiona says she's out shopping
But she's under me and I'm not stopping


'Cause Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
So don't tell Scotty
Scotty doesn't know
(So don't tell Scotty!)


I can't believe he's so trusting
While I'm right behind you thrusting (Woo)
Fiona's got him on the phone
And she's trying not to moan
It's a three way call
And he knows nothing, nothing


Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Don't tell Scotty
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
So don't tell Scotty


We'll put on a show
Everyone will go
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
The parking lot, why not
It's so cool when you're on top
His front lawn in the snow
Laughing so hard
'Cause Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
I did her on his birthday


'Cause Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Don't tell Scotty
Scotty doesn't know


Scotty will know
Scotty has to know
Scotty's gotta know
Gonna tell Scotty
Gonna tell him myself
Scotty has to know
Scotty has to know
Scotty has to
Scotty has to
Scotty has to go
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know (Don't tell Scotty)
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know (Don't tell Scotty)
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't, Scotty doesn't
Scotty doesn't know
(Scotty doesn't know)
(Scotty doesn't know)
(Scotty doesn't know)
(Scotty doesn't know)
(Scotty doesn't know)
(Scotty doesn't know)
(Scotty doesn't know)
(Scotty doesn't know)
(Scotty's gotta go)


Ha ha ha
Aha ha
I should probably 
That is so bad, so bad
