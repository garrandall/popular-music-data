Boy, you've been running around to long
Now I think you're running out of time
No more jumping in and out of my bed
It's time for me to draw the line
So you think you can call me the only one, then walk out the door
And you think you can run arround having fun,
And just come back for more


I think you're living in a fantasy
It's got to be them or me
So if you try it onr more time
Baby dont expect me to come running back to you

Running back to you
Then you'll think about love, all the good I gave to you
I won't come running back, running back to you
I won't come running back, running back to you
And I'll find someone, somebody else to give it to

Oh oh, oh oh
I won't come running back
I won't come running

Oh oh, oh oh
I won't come running back
I won't come running

Boy, hope you see before to late
I won't play the fool-no not this time
And I'll show you just how wrong you are
To think I just can't get you out of my mind

So you think you can just play me off, then walk out the door
And you think that you can just run arround and come back for more



You can't dis me when you wanna
Or come and go when you wanna
I hear you're playing around when you wanna
Any time that you wanna
Or just tell me lies when you wanna
I got more than you want oh
Oh, and by the way

Oh, oh I won't come running back, I won't come running
Oh, oh I won't come running back, I won't come running
Running back to you
Then you'll think about love, all the good I gave to you

I won't come running back, running back to you
I won't come running back, running back to you
And I'll find someone, somebody to give it to

Oh oh, oh oh
I won't come running back
I won't come running

Oh oh, oh oh
I won't come running back
I won't come running
