Haters, haters, snitch haters!
And I made myself so easy to love


Yeah, yeah
How much they hate it, very
Kiss girls like Katy Perry
I am never sprung but I Springer, Jerry
Don't try this at home, results may vary
King like T.I. but in the Chi, Larry


Hoova, HOVA, both are(a)
American gangstas you choose who's, colder(a)
Rappers get nasty in the booth,
But I'm gross, I cant even stomach myself
Ulcer(a), more realer cause I'm closer(a)
Had girlies in girldles way more than they suppose to(a),
Poser(a), No Sir(a),my hustle, so Russell,
I stretch work, yoga
You know I got it down dawg,
Al Roker, I used to knock pounds off
It ain't nothing for me to knock nouns off,
But these MCs are(a) praying for my downfall,
They just.. Haters
I wave at you, I'm so player,
I'll never be done I'm so rare


We Killing the game it's not fair
You mother fuckers stay right there
'cause we too high up in the air
We blasting off just like a laser
Nigga pewoon, pewoon, pewoon,
Get me back, give me room, room, room
DB-9 like vroomm,vroomm, vroom
Y'all ho what we doing, doing, doing


We balling, bitches,eating y'all food leaving dishes
Why these niggas always talking lead talk Ye?
Why I never see them at the Clearport Ye?
Why I always hear they at the airport
Why I fly daily like I'm in the airforce
Therefore, please stop talking my ears off
Millionaire talk, you haters,
You mad at me 'cause your paper,
Need to get his mother fucking weight up
Wait up
I ain't done, name one thing that I ain't done
It hurts when you say that I ain't won,
you haters, How do I gain your favor,
I need to know cause I care
I need you to love me I swear, look here
See Ye is, runnin' the Chi like Gale Sayers,
I'm runnin' new york, I got the mayor on my pager
You cant fade us, you hate us
I need you, stay there
I breath you, like air,
Air
Where are my haters,
I love all my haters
I love all my haters
I love all my haters
