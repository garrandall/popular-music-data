I went to a party last Saturday night
I didn't get laid, I got in a fight,
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing
Late for my job and the traffic was bad
Had to borrow ten bucks from my old man,
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing
I went to a party last Saturday night
I told you that story, I'd be alright
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing
But I know what I like
I know I like dancin' with you
And I know what you like
I know you like dancin' with me
Yeah, yeah
Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
C'mon pretty baby, kiss me deadly
Had a few beers, gettin' high
Sittin', watchin' the time go by,
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing
Nothin' to eat and no TV
Lookin' in the mirror don't get it for me
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing
But I know what I like
I know I like dancin' with you
And I know what you like
I know you like dancin' with me
Oh, yeah
Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
C'mon pretty baby, kiss me deadly
Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
C'mon pretty baby, kiss me deadly
You know I like dancin' with you
Dancin' with you
C'mon
Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
C'mon pretty baby, kiss me deadly
Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
C'mon pretty baby, kiss me
C'mon pretty baby, kiss me
C'mon pretty baby, kiss me deadly
