Gotta be cool baby, ya know what I'm saying


Jump out your car in the middle of the street
Open up your trunk, let the bass beat
Go ahead
Go ahead
You gotta walk up in the club bare-footed
I like that booty, you know where to put it
Go ahead
Go ahead
Now Mama, you look so professional
I'm following you, sweating you
I can't believe I'm doing what I'm doing
What is wrong with my head?
Go ahead
Cuz baby I like how you working it
I'm watching you, you twirking it
I'm trying to get you out of this club
And get you up in my bed
Go ahead


Now let me see that booty work, booty work
Booty, Boo-Boo-Booty work
Booty work, booty work
Booty, Boo-Boo-Booty work
Go ahead, go ahead
Now let me see that booty work
Booty, Boo-Boo-Booty Work
Left cheek, right cheek, left cheek, right cheek
Show off, show off, show off, Boom!
Show off, show off, show off, Boom!


(Boss)
Black car, black rims
Black shirt, black Tims
Come on baby, keep on doing what you're doing
Come on baby, keep on doing what you're doing
Holy moly, look at her
She got the boots, with the fur
Come on baby, keep on doing what you're doing
Come on baby, keep on doing what you're doing
Now mama, I can see that thong on you, the DJ played the song for you
I'm trying to drive my stick shift... all over them curves
Say word
If you keep playing with my fitted we gone get it, get it, get it
Girl, I represent the Nappy Boy clique, so I know that you heard
Say word
(Nappy Boy)


[Now let me see that booty work, booty work
Booty, Boo-Boo-Booty work
Booty work, booty work
Booty, Boo-Boo-Booty work
Go ahead, go ahead
Now let me see that booty work
Booty, Boo-Boo-Booty Work]
[Left cheek, right cheek, left cheek, right cheek
Show off, show off, show off, Boom!
Show off, show off, show off, Boom!]


Girl, it must be a crime to be as fine as you
You know exactly what I'm trying to do
You see me, I'm trying to keep it jumping
Girl, I got a Chevy with hydraulics and you reminding me of it
Up and down, up and down, girl you know what's happening
Round of applause: keep that booty clapping
Them other girls lacking what you packing
And you got them embarrassed by what you got from your parents
I'm trying to see them shorts, spread apart
I ain't coming up short, Kevin Hart
Now take off
Come on baby, keep on doing what you're doing
Take off
Come on baby, keep on doing what you're doing
Move your feet, cut a rug
Put your hands up if you're the baddest in the club
Take off, come on baby keep on doing what you're doing
Girl I'm tryin get you next to me
But first you gotta let me see that


[Now let me see that booty work, booty work
Booty, Boo-Boo-Booty work
Booty work, booty work
Booty, Boo-Boo-Booty work
Go ahead, go ahead
Now let me see that booty work
Booty, Boo-Boo-Booty Work]
[Left cheek, right cheek, left cheek, right cheek
Show off, show off, show off, Boom!
Show off, show off, show off, Boom!]
