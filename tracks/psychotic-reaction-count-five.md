I feel depressed, I feel so bad
'Cause you're the best girl that I've ever had
I can't get your love, I can't get a fraction
Oh little girls, psychotic reaction
And it feels like this


I feel so lonely night and day
I can't get your love, I must stay away
Well I need you, girl, by my side
Oh little girl, would you like to take a ride now?
I can't get your love, I can't get satisfaction
Oh little girl, psychotic reaction
