You know I've had my share of dealing with despair
I'm tired of seeing my dreams vanish in the air
Enough of users and all them two time losers
I've seen that killing floor and I just won't take no more

So I'm gonna move out on the highway
Head on down the road leaving it all behind
Had enough of lying. There'll be no more crying this time
Living on the edge. Running with the wind
Soaring to the heights on an eagle's wing

If you wanna see your spirit flying free
Then step outside your mind and cross over the line
Don't spend your lifetime weeping
For things that ain't worth keeping
Life can be very short and you know everybody is bought

So I'm gonna move out on the highway
Head on down the road leaving it all behind
Had enough of lying. There'll be no more crying this time
Living on the edge. Running with the wind
Soaring to the heights on an eagle's wing

It's time to go down to Mexico
Mescalitos' song will help you to be strong

So come on move on down the highway
Head on down the road leaving it all behind
Had enough of lying. There'll be no more crying this time
