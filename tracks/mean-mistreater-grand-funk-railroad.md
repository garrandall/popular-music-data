Mean mistreater, you make me cry
You lay around and watch me die
Mean mistreater, can't you see I'm real?
Are you satisfied with the way you feel?

I've tried hard to live without you in so many ways
I just can't help myself from thinking of you for the rest of my days
Heartache is at my door step, won't leave me alone
I just can't get used to it, now that I'm on my own

I know all about you, your childhood days
Your mom and dad, your pretty face
Mean mistreater, if you need me
I'm needin' you to set me free
