I started a joke, which started the whole world crying
But I didn't see that the joke was on me, oh no
I started to cry, which started the whole world laughing
Oh, if I'd only seen that the joke was on me

I looked at the skies, running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed, hurting my head from things that I'd said
'Til I finally died, which started the whole world living
Oh, if I'd only seen that the joke was on me

I looked at the skies, running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed, hurting my head from things that I'd said
'Til I finally died, which started the whole world living
Oh, if I'd only seen, oh yeah, that the joke was on me
Oh no, that the joke was on me, oh
