Ah, ah, you're beautiful
(Yeah)
Ah, ah, you're beautiful


Hop on the back of my bike
Let the good wind blow through your hair
With an ass like that and a smile so bright
Oh, you're killing me, you know it ain't fair, yeah
Ride on through the middle of the night
Let the moonlight kiss your skin
When you dance like that, your jeans so tight
Oh, you're killing me, baby do it again


You're beautiful, and your mind is fucking beautiful
And I can't pretend that doesn't mean a thing to me, to me, yeah
You're beautiful, good lord, you're fucking beautiful
And I can't pretend that doesn't mean a thing to me, to me, yeah, yeah


I like when you run red lights
Don't stop 'til you thrill me, oh how you thrill me
Always in control, how you do it, I don't know
But I don't care, take me anywhere
'Cause it's beautiful, ooh you make me feel undressable
And I can't pretend that doesn't mean a thing to me, to me, oh yeah


You're beautiful, and your mind is fucking beautiful
And I can't pretend that doesn't mean a thing to me, to me, yeah
You're beautiful, good lord, you're fucking beautiful
And I can't pretend that doesn't mean a thing to me, to me, yeah, yeah

Oh-oo-oh, oh-oo-oh (ah, ah, so beautiful)
Yeah Yeah (ah, ah, so beautiful)
You don't know what you're doing darling, no-oh (ah, ah, so beautiful)
Hop on back my bike darling, oh I take you (ah, ah, so beautiful)
Oh-oh-ah, oh-oh-ah, oh-oh-ah, ah-ah-ah...
Don't you worry darling (oh-oh-ah, oh-oh-ah, oh-oh-ah, ah-ah-ah...)
