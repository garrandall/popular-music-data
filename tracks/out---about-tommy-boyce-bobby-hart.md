Out and About
Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart

Nothing going on around here
That hasn't gone on all year
Stayin' in day out and day in
Wishin' i was outside playin'
Out and about
I got a little thing going for me
Out and about
Free from all the things that bore me
Out and about
Riding all around the city
Out and about
All the girls they look so pretty
I'm fine, when i'm
When i'm out and about
Things i want i can't afford 'em
Nothing in this house but boredom
Magazines are torn and tattered
Running out of reading matter
I gotta run outside and see what's happening
Out and about
Where the sun is always shining
Out and about
Look at all the fun i'm finding
Out and about
Bumping into friends and laughing
Out and about
What a groovy time we're having
We'll have a good time
When i'm out and about
Out and about
When i'm out and about
Out and about
