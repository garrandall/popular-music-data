I come from the bottom, such an amazing view
I climbed up and out of it
Some of my friends couldn't take the news
I have a plate of leftover food for thought that I save for you
Even your shadow leaves you in darkness
Stand there and face the truth
Sooner or later the tables will turn
And we all get to play the fool
But you've gotten way too used to being fooled
You lost your turn to move
Oh my gosh you still stuck in one spot, standing in crazy glue
Now you're upset with me cuz
I cut my change and escaped the zoo
Nigga its eat or get ate
There is a war going on and nobody is safe
I can say stop the violence but truth is
I'm rocking my Glock 29 on my waist
No hesitation at all
Either you quick to the draw or you get erased
I pack a 30 round clip
I only tuck that bitch in when I'm on a date
This world can burn and I wouldn't care
We're a long way away from fair
Papa ain't ever showed his face and momma ain't hardly there
I called on all the Kingsmen to come decorate my chair
Then I sat on that throne and
I told them war has been declared and they told me

Yeah, yeah, yeah, ohhh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Heavy lies the head that wears the crown
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ohhh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah
I said heavy lies the head that wears the crown
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ohhh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Heavy lies the head that wears the crown
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ohhh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Heavy lies the head that wears the crown

Had a talk with my baby sister, the other day shes engaged
She asked me if I'd ever go there I told her I couldn't say
Maybe its me, spend so much time and effort on getting paid that
Whenever I try and pick the right card feel like I'm getting played
I go do a show and they scream my name and I'm amazed
And I go back to grinding full time the second I'm off the stage
Where would we be if it wasn't for me, we can't afford to find out
I'm trying to carry this team but we in trouble if I foul out
Fuck you expecting? 
I won't surrender I won't retreat
I'm going in strapped with c4 about to blow in this bitch
Parameter breach, BOOM
I got no armor I'm strapped like the army
No wonder they coming for me
If I go out I hope you send your goodbyes
Because everyone's coming with me
This bitch can burn and I wouldn't care
We're a long way away from fair
Papa ain't ever showed his face and momma ain't never there
I called on all the Kingsmen to come decorate my chair
Then I laid back in that throne and
I told them war has been declared and they told me

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, ohhh yeah
Yeah, (yeah) yeah, (yeah) yeah, (yeah) oh yeah
Heavy lies the head that wears the crown
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ohhh yeah
Yeah, (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) oh yeah
Heavy lies the head that wears the crown
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ohhh yeah
Yeah, (yeah) yeah, (yeah) yeah, (yeah) oh yeah
Heavy lies the head that wears the crown
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ohhh yeah
Yeah (yeah) yeah, (yeah) yeah, (yeah) oh yeah
Heavy lies the head that wears the crown
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ohhh yeah
Yeah, (yeah) yeah, (yeah) yeah, (yeah) oh yeah
Heavy lies the head that wears the crown
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ohhh yeah
Yeah, (yeah) yeah, (yeah) yeah, (yeah) oh yeah
Heavy lies the head that wears the crown
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ohhh yeah
Yeah (yeah) yeah, (yeah) yeah, (yeah) oh yeah
Heavy lies the head that wears the crown
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ohhh yeah
Yeah (yeah) yeah, (yeah) yeah, (yeah) oh yeah
