"Oh wow, man, that's it"
"Wait a second, man
What do you think the teacher's gonna look like this year?"
"My butt, man!"
Oh, uh!
Oh yeah!


T-t-teacher, stop that screamin'
Teacher, don't you see?
Don't wanna be no uptown fool
Maybe I should go to Hell, but I'm doin' well
And teacher needs to see me after school


I think of all the education that I missed
But then my homework was never quite like this
Ow, got it bad, got it bad, got it bad
I'm hot for teacher
I've got it bad, so bad
I'm hot for teacher


"Hey, I heard you missed us, we're back!"
("I'm ready")
"I brought my pencil
Gimme something to write on, man!"
Yeah, go
Uh!
Oh


I heard about your lessons, but lessons are so cold
I know about this school
Little girl from Cherry Lawn, how can you be so bold?
How did you know that golden rule?


I think of all the education that I missed
But then my homework was never quite like this
Whoa, got it bad, got it bad, got it bad
I'm hot for teacher
I've got it bad, so bad
I'm hot for teacher
Wha-oh




"Oh man, I think the clock is slow, man"
("What are you doing this weekend?")
"I don't feel tardy"
"Class dismissed!"
Oh yeah


I've got it bad, got it bad, got it bad
I'm hot for teacher
Oh
Oh, a-yes I'm hot
Wow!


Oh my God!
Whoo!
