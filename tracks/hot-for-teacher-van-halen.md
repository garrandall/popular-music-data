Good morning class.
I'm your substitute teacher this morning, my name is Mr. Goodbody.
We'll be reviewing the text from Moby Dick.
So please turn now to page... 69.

(Oh yeah)

T-t-t-teacher stop that screaming
Teacher, don't you see?
Don't wanna be no uptown fool
Maybe I should go to hell
But I'm doing well
Teacher need to see me after school

I think of all the education that I missed
But then my homework was never quite like this

Got it bad, got it bad, got it bad
I'm hot for teacher
I've got it bad, so bad
I'm hot for teacher

Mobdy Dick begins, "Call me Ishmael"
Greg? In the back, you there, Greg. Can you quiet down please?
I'm trying to reach this text.
Alright. I want you to turn your assignments in today
Uh, and Nora I'm gonna have to ask you to stay after class.

(Ooh)

I heard about your lessons
But lessons are so cold
I know about this school
Little boy from Cherry Lane
How can you be so bold?
How did you know the golden rule?

I think of all the education that I missed
But then my homework was never quite like this

Got it bad, got it bad, got it bad
I'm hot for teacher
I've got it bad, so bad
I'm hot for teacher

Tomorrow there will be an essay due on the dialectical shamanism of David Lee Roth, and there will be a pop quiz.
Does anybody have any questions?
(Class dismissed!)

(Oh)

I've got it bad, got it bad, got it bad
I'm hot for teacher
Oh yes I'm hot

Oh... my... God.
