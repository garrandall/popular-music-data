Girl I've been waiting on this long hard day to get over
So I can rest my head right here on your shoulder
I just wanna lay here and feel you breathe
Listen to the rhythm of your heartbeat
And see where it leads

We're wide awake but girl I wanna make you close your eyes
And say my name like only you can say then hold me tight
All I need is only you and me alone tonight
I wanna make you close your eyes... oh yeah

You can make me work for it girl if you want to
Just leave a trail for me to follow you into the bedroom
And if you need a little bit of help from me
Babe there's not a button that I can't reach
Lets see where it leads

We're wide awake but girl I wanna make you close your eyes
And say my name like only you can say then hold me tight
All I need is only you and me alone tonight
I wanna make you close your eyes

I wanna take you somewhere... out there
'Til the world fades out of sight

We're wide awake but girl I wanna make you close your eyes
And say my name like only you can say then hold me tight... just hold me tight
All I need is only you and me alone tonight
Yeah... I wanna make you close your eyes... oh

I wanna make you close your eyes... oh
Girl... I wanna make you close your eyes
