Live, live every minute
Don't leave till tomorrow
What you can do today
Any news is bad news
When your world comes tumbling down
You can fight but you lose
Submission can't be found
So what am I gonna do
Don't sit and talk about it
How will I get through
Don't sit and dream about it
I know it's right
You know it's right
To spend yourself
A little at a time


Live, live every minute
Don't leave 'til tomorrow
What you can do today
Give, give every minute
Try a little harder
And you will find your way
Love will bring you sweets
And take your hopes so high
When you're at your least
Love will say goodbye
So how did it happen to me
Don't be a fool about it
Was I so blind not to see
Don't blame yourself about it
I know it's wrong
You know it's right
To spend yourself
A little time


Find your way, find your way
Find your way, find your way
Find your way, find your way...
