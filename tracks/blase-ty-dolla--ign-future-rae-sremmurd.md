You know what's going on
Over there and over there, okay


(Ordered up a hundred roses
Need a benz like BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©
Whiping Maserati, skurr, skurr, skurr
BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©
BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©)
Ordered up a hundred bottles in the club like
BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©
Whiping Maserati, skurr, skurr, skurr
Oh, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©


BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©, all I drink is Bombay
When I'm with my niggas, I might drink that Henny
Smoking Kush and pull it, motherfuck the police
I ain't scared to die, on them dead homies
Hit them licks, wh-whipping the bricks
Still with the shit
I'm young and I'm rich, young and I'm rich
I got hoes nigga, I got hoes in different area codes, I think I'm Nate Dogg
I started from the ground I'm that nigga now
I stay with the loud, can you hear me now?
And my bitch cold, She a centerfold
Put her on a stand, and she never told


(Ordered up a hundred roses
Need a benz like BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©
Whiping Maserati, skurr, skurr, skurr
BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©
BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©)
Ordered up a hundred bottles in the club like
BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©
Whiping Maserati, skurr, skurr, skurr
Oh, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©


I break the bank like an athlete, hon
Shawty caught drunk, fucking up her new Louboutins
If I let her in my Masi she might be a trending topic
Before she gotta ride it, bust it, pop it, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©
Been spent your rent and I'm still blowing big faces
Something 'bout them Ben Franklins make any bitch get naked
Crew got the juice, bitch you don't need no chasers
Ball on these niggas, I need knee replacements


(Ordered up a hundred roses

BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©
Whiping Maserati, skurr, skurr, skurr
Oh, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©, BlasÃ©


Sipping out the jug until I feel it in my body
I was, uh, hoping you were salty when you saw me, keep a rowdy
Scene around me, all we do is dip and dab
Got twin turbos on twin turbos and them bitches really smash
It's a 50/50 chance I might, get ya, get ya
It's a 50/50 chance that these niggas didn't pitch in
I'm pouring up 'til I can't no more
I swear everything I see slow mo'
