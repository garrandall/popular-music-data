If her voice can bring
Every hope of Spring
That's Judy
My Judy
If her eyes say "yes"
But you're wrong in your guess
That's Judy
My Judy
If you hear her call
In a soft, southern drawl
"Hi! Stranger!"
That's danger
If you're smart; watch yourr heart
She'll upset 'most any fellows apple cart!
In a hundred ways
You'll be shouting her praise
She'll let 'ya
She'll get 'ya
When she sees you fall
She will will tell you "That's all,..."
"You wrtech 'ya!"
You betcha
Then you'l know all the heartaches
Of a fool just like me
If she seem a saint
And you'll find that she ain't
That's Judy
Sure as you're born
