You did it to yourself 
Now ur all by yourself 
Actin like u hate me 
I left because you made me 
You played me ta tha left 
Now theres nobody left to hear ur complaining 
Im gone n all ur hearing 
Is your own echo echo 
N I'm gone 
N ur all alone 
Cant you hear tha echo echo 
No one ta hear you 
Theres nobody near you 

It started off great 
But who was to know 
That love is lost 
Can not be let go 
You say its my fault 
Ok then ill go 
Its better to no 
How its nobody ta agrue with 
Cuz I'm not home 
Dont care who your with 
Dont call my phone 
Or did you forget 
You no your wrong, I'm gone 
N you all alone 
You and your own damn echo echo 
And I'm gone, n your all alone 
Can you hear tha echo echo 
Nobody near you, theres no one ta hear you 

Disgusted with trust 
Ill trust no one no more 
Just went with tha floor 
Just went with the flow 
Found myself on the floor 
When you went away 
All my pain went astray 
Like it's a new day 
Now I have no one to argue with 
Cause I'm not home 
Don't care who your with 
Don't call my phone 
Or did you forget 
You know your wrong 
I'm gone! 
And your all alone 
Hearing your own damn 
Echo echo 
No one is near you 
No one can hear you 
Its your own damn echo echo 
No one ta hear you 
Its nobody near you 


Funny I dont feel that bad 
Ta be honest I feel just fine 
I lost something thats down of grabing 
She lost something thats one of a kind 
Should of known she'd do it that 
She like RnB but she loves rap 
Wanna leave me for da hip hop cat 
Then try ta come back 
(lemmie speak ur language) 
Really dont matter if you realize what you did 
Much to little and way to late for da kid 
We ova wit so now it just is what it is 
Wasn't thinkin bout us when you was sliddin off with him 
So since I paid fo tha crib 
Find some where else ta live but just fo a min you can sit n listen ta your own 
Echo echo ooo I'm talkin bout you n ur 
Echo echo just you n ur echo echo 
No one ta hear you 
Its nobody near you 
Its ur own damn echo echo 

No one to argue with 
Cause I'm not home 
Don't care who your with 
Don't call my phone 
Or did you forget 
You know your wrong 
I'm gone!
