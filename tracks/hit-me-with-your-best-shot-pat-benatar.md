Well you're the real tough cookie with a long history
Of breaking little hearts like the one in me
That's okay, let's see how you do it
Put up your dukes, let's get down to it


Hit me with your best shot
Why don't you hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away


You come on with it, come on, you don't fight fair
That's okay, see if I care
Knock me down, it's all in vain
I get right back on my feet again


Hit me with your best shot
Why don't you hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away




Well you're the real tough cookie with a long history
Of breaking little hearts like the one in me
Before I put another notch in my lipstick case
You better make sure you put me in my place


Hit me with your best shot
C'mon, hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away


Hit me with your best shot
Why don't you hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away
