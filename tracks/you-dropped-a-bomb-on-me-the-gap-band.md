You were the girl that changed my world
You were the girl for me
You lit the fuse, I stand accused
You were the first for me
But you turned me out, baby

You dropped a bomb on me, baby
You dropped a bomb on me (But you turned me on, baby)
You dropped a bomb on me, baby
You dropped a bomb on me

You were my thrills, you were my pills
You dropped a bomb on me
You turn me out, you turn me on
You turned me loose, then you turned me wrong

You dropped a bomb on me, baby
You dropped a bomb on me (But you turned me out, baby)
You dropped a bomb on me, baby
You dropped a bomb on me

Just like Adam and Eve, said you'd set me free
You took me to the sky, Id never been so high
You were my pills, you were my thrills
You were my hope, baby, you were my smoke
You dropped a bomb, hey, babe

You dropped a bomb on me, baby
You dropped a bomb on me (But you turned me out, baby)
You dropped a bomb on me, baby
You dropped a bomb on me (But you turned me on, baby)

You dropped a bomb on me, baby (Mmm)
You dropped a bomb on me (You dropped a bomb on me, baby)
You dropped a bomb on me, baby
You dropped a bomb on me

We were in motion, felt like an ocean
You were the girl for me
You were the first explosion, turned out to be corrosion
You were the first for me
But you turned me out, baby

You dropped a bomb on me, baby
You dropped a bomb on me (Whoa...whoa...oh...oh...baby)
You dropped a bomb on me, baby
You dropped a bomb on me (I won't forget what you done to me, babe)

You dropped a bomb on me, baby
You dropped a bomb on me
You dropped a bomb on me, baby

You dropped a bomb on me

I-I-I
I-I-I won't forget it
I-I-I
I-I-I won't forget it

You dropped a bomb on me, baby
You dropped a bomb on me
You dropped a bomb on me, baby
You dropped a bomb on me

I-I-I
I-I-I won't forget it
I-I-I
I-I-I won't forget it

You turned me out, you turned me on
And then you dropped me to the ground
You dropped a bomb on me.

You turned me out, you turned me on
And then you dropped me to the ground
You dropped a bomb on me
You turned me out, you turned me on
And then you dropped me to the ground
You dropped a bomb on me

You turned me out, then you turned me on
You dropped a bomb on me
You turned me out, then you turned me on
You dropped a bomb on me

You turned me out, then you turned me on
You dropped a bomb on me
You turned me out, then you turned me on
You dropped a bomb on me

You turned me out, then you turned me on
You dropped a bomb on me
You turned me out, then you turned me on
You dropped a bomb on me

You turned me out, then you turned me on
You dropped a bomb on me
You turned me out, then you turned me on
You dropped a bomb on me
