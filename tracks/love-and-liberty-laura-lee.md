Her liberty bell rings
For all the women
This day I decree
Freedom

Hear me
Love and liberty
That's how it's got to be
Love and liberty
Girl, set yourself free

There used to be a time
A woman couldn't vote
If she wanted a cigarette
She had to hide its smoke

A woman needs man's love
His love and affection
But we don't want to live
Under his objection

We want love and liberty
That's how it's got to be
Love and liberty
Girl‚ set yourself free

There are too many women
Under a curfew
He stays out all night
Wants you home by two
Stop watching the clock
Don't be Cindarellas
Stay and have some fun
Just like the fellas

We want love (love and liberty)
But we got to have our freedom‚ y'all (that is what we need)
Give me love  (love and liberty)
Got to have our freedom y'all (set yourself free)
Give me love  (love and liberty)
Freedom  (that is what we need)
We got to have love (love and liberty)
Girl set yourself free

Freedom (freedom)
Ah right now
Freedom
Take our freedom
Give it to us right now

Girls we no longer
Have to run and hide
And keep our desires
All up inside
Do what you want to do
When a man's around
Let your hair down
Walk like you want to walk
Talk like you want to talk
Wear what you want to wear
Go bad if you want to go bad

We want love and liberty
That's how it's got to be
Love and liberty
Girl‚ set yourself free
We want love
But we got to have our freedom y'all
We want love
We need our freedom y'all
We want love and liberty
That's how it's got to be
Love and liberty
Girl, set yourself free
We want love
But we ...
