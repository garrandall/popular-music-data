Why can't we be humble
Like the good Lord say?
He promised to exalt us
But love is the way

How men be so greedy
When there's so much left?
All things are God-given
And they all have been blessed

That's the way God planned it
That's the way God wants it to be
That's the way God planned it
That's the way God wants it to be

Let not your heart be troubled
Let mourning, sobbing cease
Learn to help one another
And live in perfect peace

If we'd just be humble
Like the good Lord say, yeah
He promised to exalt us
But love is the way

That's the way God planned it
That's the way God wants it to be
You better believe me
(That's the way God planned it)
(That's the way God wants it to be)

I hope you get this message
Where you won't, others will
You don't understand me
But I'll love you still

That's the way God planned it
That's the way God wants it to be
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(That's the way God planned it)
That's the way God wants it to be
You better believe me

That's the way God planned it
That's the way God wants it to be
That's the way God planned it
That's the way God wants it to be
That's the way God planned it
That's the way God wants it to be
