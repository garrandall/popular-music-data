Life is just a lonely highway
I'm out here on the open road
I'm old enough to see behind me
But young enough to feel my soul
I don't want to lose you baby
And I don't want to be alone
Don't want to live my days without you
But for now I've got to be without you


I've got a pocket full of money
And a pocket full of keys that have no bounds
But then I think of loving
And I just can't get you off of my mind
Yeah...


Babe can't you see
That this is killing me
I don't want to push you baby
And I don't want you to be told
It's just that I can't breathe without you
Feel like I'm going to lose control


I've got a pocket full of money
And pocket full of keys that have no bounds
But when it comes to loving
I just can't get you off of my mind
Yeah...


Am I a fool to think that there's a little hope
Yeah yeahhhhhheee yeah
Tell me baby, yeah
What are the rules the reasons and the do's and don'ts
Yeah yeahhhhhheee yeah
Tell me baby tell me baby, yeah
What do you feel inside?


I've got a pocket full of money
And a pocket full of keys that have no bounds
Oh yeah
But when it comes down to loving
I just can't get you off of my mind
Yeah...
I just can't get you off of my mind
Yeah...
