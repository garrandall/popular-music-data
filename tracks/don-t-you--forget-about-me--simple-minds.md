Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh...


Won't you come see about me?
I'll be alone, dancing you know it baby
Tell me your troubles and doubts
Given everything inside and out and
Love's strange so real in the dark
Think of the tender things that we were working on
Slow chains may pull us apart
When our life gets into your heart, baby


Don't you forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't you forget about me


Will you stand above me?
Look my way, never love me
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling
Down, down, down
Will you recognize me?
Call my name or walk on by
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling
Down, down, down, down
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Ohhhh...


Don't you try to pretend
It's my feeling we'll win in the end
I won't harm you or touch your defenses
Vanity, insecurity
Don't you forget about me
I'll be alone, dancing you know it baby
Going to take you apart
I'll put us back together at heart, baby


Don't you forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't you forget about me


As you walk on by
Will you call my name?
As you walk on by
Will you call my name?
When you walk away
Or will you walk away?
Will you walk on by?
Come on, call my name
Will you call my name?


I say
La la la
When you walk on by
La la la
