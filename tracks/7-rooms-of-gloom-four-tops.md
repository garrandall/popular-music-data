I see a house, a house of stone
A lonely house, 'cause now you're gone
7 rooms, that's all it is
7 rooms of gloom
I live with emptiness, without your tenderness
You can take the dream I had for us, and turn that dream into dust
I watch a phone that never rings
I watch your door that never brings
Brings you back into my life, and turn this darkness into light
I'm all alone in this house, turn this house into a home

I need your touch to comfort me
Your tender, tender arms that once held me
Without your love, your love inside
This house is just a place to run and hide
7 rooms, that's all it is
7 rooms of gloom
I live with emptiness, without your tenderness

Don't make me live from day to day
Watching a clock that ticks away
Another day, another way, another reason for me to say
I need you here, here with me
I need you darling, desperately

I'm all alone, all alone in this house that's not a home

I miss your love, I once had known
I miss your kiss that was my very, very own
In the silence that surrounds me, lonely walls - they stand
7 rooms, that's all it is
7 rooms of gloom
I live with emptiness, without your tenderness

And all the windows are painted black
I'll wait right here until you get back
I'll keep waiting, and waiting, until your face again I see
Darling, yeah hea, huh

I want you back now
I keep waiting, and waiting
I want you back now
I keep waiting, and waiting, come on back now....
I keep waiting, and waiting, and waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
I want you back now, whoa - now
Come on back now...
