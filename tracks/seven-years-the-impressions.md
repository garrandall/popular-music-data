Seven years remember when
You became my loving friend
Never forget that wonderful day
Twas early spring the first of May
Everybody was so alarmed
Though I never meant you no harm
I was just so in love with you
And I thought you loved me too
Seven years now I find
It was just a waste of time

Oh, it's been so long
And I'm yet to take you home
You stand there, undecided
While your friends keep us divided
You're like a lost long freight
And no longer shall I wait
I find it isn't fair
When there's only one who'll care
Should have been gone away so long
But I'm still here hangin' on

Seven years here an advice
And there's nothing yet precise
I got the girl I waited for
She's just a wife and nothing more
I hate the sound call of my name
What a shame who can I blame
I was just so in love with you
And I thought you loved me too
Seven years now I find
It was just a waste of time

Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh
Seven years, seven years
I cried a lotta tears
Having hard time, hard time
