There's a hole in the wall
With a light shining in
And it's letting me know to get up
It's time to begin

Oh there is nothing to lose
'Cause it's already lost
In a runaway world
Of confusion
I'm gonna take it


That's why I fight fire with fire
Oh I'm burning inside and my heart is a-cryin'
Fire with fire
I don't want to lose this flamin' desire
Standing alone
In a crowded room
I can feel a chill in the air
I'm shakin'

I'm miles away
I want to cry out loud
I want to fight till the end
I won't let 'em take me alive


And you know I'll fight fire with fire
Oh I'm burning inside and my heart is a-cryin'
Fire with fire
'Cause I'm never gonna lose this flamin' desire
