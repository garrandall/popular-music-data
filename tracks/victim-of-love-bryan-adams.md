Livin' on your own can be a lonely game
A face in the crowd - no one knows your name
It's a table for one and a broken heart to go

She's the kind of lover that you always dreamed
Would come to stay and never wanna leave
But that's all changed - she's dealt the final blow
Heaven knows what you were thinkin' of
Don't blame yourself you're just a victim of love

It doesn't matter who was right or wrong
When the fire is over - when the magic's gone
You pick up the pieces and do the best you can

It knocks you down but you try it again
You get a little older it's a cryin' shame
Sometimes things don't work out like you plan

Who's gonna help when you've had enough
It ain't no secret you're a victim of love
Heaven knows what you were thinkin' of
Don't blame yourself you're just a victim of love

One goodbye was really all it took
Now you thumb through the pages of your little black book
But somehow all the numbers look the same
You've been thinkin' how to get around it
But there ain't nothin' you can do about it
Nothin' ventured - nothin' gained

Ain't nothin' you can't rise above
Call it what you want but you're a victim of love

Who's gonna help you when you've had enough
Ain't no secret you're a victim of love

I don't wanna lose your love...
