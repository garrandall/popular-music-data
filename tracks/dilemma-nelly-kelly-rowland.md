I.. love you, and I.. need you
Nelly I.. love you, I do.. neeeeed you - but


No matter what I do, all I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo, know you know I'm crazy over you
No matter what I do, all I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo, y'know I'm crazy over you


Check it, check it, check it, uhh
I met this chick and she just moved right up the block from me
And uhh, she got the hots for me the finest thing my hood done seen
But oh no, oh no, she gotta a man
and a son, doh'ohhh, but that's okay
Cause I, wait for my cue and just listen, play my position
Like a shortstop, pick up e'rything mami hittin
And in no time.. (no time) I..
I plan to make this wah-one mi-i-ne.. and that's for sure
Cause I, I never been the type to, break up a happy home
But uh, there's somethin bout baby girl I just can't leave alone
So tell me ma what's it gonna be? She said
(You don't know what you mean to me)




Check it, check it, check it, uhh
I see a lot and you look and I never say a word
I know how niggaz start actin trippin out here about they girls
And there's no way-ayy-hey, Nelly gon' fight over
no day-hey-ame.. as you can see
But I, I like your steez, your style, your whole demeanor
The way you come through and holla and swoop me in his 2-seater
Now that's gangstah-ah-ahhh..
And I got special ways to thank yah-ah-ahhh.. don't you forget it
But uh, it ain't that easy for you to pack and leave him
But uh, you and dirty got ties for different reasons
I respect that and right before I turn to leave, she said



 Sing it for me K


I.. love you, and I.. need you
Nelly I.. love you, I do.. (c'mon girl)
And it's more than you'll.. ever know
But.. it's fo'sho
You can always count on my love
Foreveeeeer more, yeahh-yeahh..


East coast, I know you shakin right
Down South, I know you bouncin right
West coast, I know you walkom right, cause
Midwest, I see you swingin right
(You don't know what you mean to me)




East coast, I know you shakin right
Down South, I know you bouncin right
West coast, I know you walkin right, cause
Midwest, I see you swing it right
(You don't know what you mean to me)
East coast, you still shakin right
Down South, I see you bouncin right
West coast, I know you walkin right, cause
Midwest, I see you swingin right
(You don't know what you mean to me)




East coast, I know you shakin right
Down South, I know you bouncin right
West coast, I know you walkin right
Midwest, I see you swing it right
(You don't know what you mean to me)
East coast, you still shakin right
Down South, I see you bouncin right
West coast, I know you walkin right, cause
Midwest, I see you swingin right
(You don't know what you mean to me)
