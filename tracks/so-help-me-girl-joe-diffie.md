You could've kissed me, like this wasn't gonna last
Kept me from saying something I'll never take back
You could have held me like there was no chance
Of me waking up where I am
You could have stop short of every dream I've ever had

So help me girl
You've gone too far
Its way too late
To save my heart
The way it feels
Each time we touch
I know Ive never been so loved
And I can't help myself
So help me girl

You had to be there when that old sun came up
Makin last night feel like a vision of things yet to come
You just had to hold me like nobody else
Now look what you've gone and done
You had to love me till I couldn't get enough

So help me girl
You've gone too far
Its way too late
To save my heart
The way it feels
Each time we touch
I know Ive never been so loved
And I can't help myself
So help me girl

So help me girl
You've gone too far
Its way too late
To save my heart
The way it feels
Each time we touch
I know Ive never been so loved
And I can't help myself
So help me girl

Now I can't help myself so help me girl
