The moon is waxing over the water
A silver path across the lake
A loon is calling to her lover
The sweetest love song ever sang

Minnesota land of my childhood
You are flowing through my veins
And I am drawn to your safe harbor
Forever thirsty for a drink

Last night we watched the electric light show
Playing wide across the sky
Sat on the front porch in sacred silence
The sparks almost made me cry

Minnesota land of my childhood
You are flowing through my veins
And I am drawn to your safe harbor
Forever thirsty for a drink

Like the willow my roots grow stronger
Searching deep searching wide
I wanna linger a little longer
Until I reach the other side

The moon is waxing over the water
A million stars fill up the night
I am nothing I am holy
A voyageur under northern lights

Minnesota land of my childhood
You are flowing through my veins
And I am drawn to your safe harbor
Forever thirsty for a drink
