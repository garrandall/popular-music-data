Hey do it now
Yeah hey

Yeah, there was a funky singer
Playin' in a rock & Roll Band
And never had no problems yeah
Burnin' down one night stands
And everything around me, yeah
Got to stop to feelin' so low
And I decided quickly, Yes I did
To disco down and check out the show

Yeah they was
Dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down that boogie and play that funky music till you die
Till you die, oh till you die

Spoken: Gonna play that electified funky music, yeah

--- Guitar Solo ---

(Spoken: Hey wait a minute)
Now first it wasn't easy
Changin' Rock & Roll and minds
And things were getting shaky
I thought I'd have to leave it behind
But now it's so much better
(Spoken: it's so much better)
I'm funking out in every way
But I'll never lose that feelin'
(Spoken: no I won't)
Of how I learned my lesson that day

When they were...
Dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down that boogie and play that funky music till you die
Till you die, oh till you die

They shouted play that funky music
Play that funky music
Play that funky music
Gotta keep on playin' funky music
Play that funky music
