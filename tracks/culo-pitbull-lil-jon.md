We back again (Hey!)
Chico, what's up, boy?
The ladies said it ain't enough songs for them to dance to
(What?) Let's make 'em dance


The king is here
Shake yo ass, ay mi madre
Todo eso culo, shake yo ass
Entonces dale 


Go 'head girl work it out (sexy girl)
Go 'head girl work it out (dale loca)
Go 'head girl work it out (sexy girl)
Go 'head girl work it out (dale loca)
Go 'head girl work it out (work it out)
Go 'head girl work it out (work it out)
Go 'head girl work it out (work it out)
Go 'head girl work it out


So, so sexy (sexy)
So, so fine (fine)
So, so feisty (feisty)
Let me see you whine
So, so kinky (kinky)
So, so freaky (freaky)
So, so naughty (naughty)
Such a good time
Do that nasty dance
Let me see ya work
Shake it up, girl
Till your hips hurt
Make that thang hard
Make that booty drop
Whip your body hard
Shake it, don't stop!




Pit
I was ready for a little bit a foreplay, for sho'
Oh-k-k-k (dale)
Baby, say you wanna open up a Pandora box
She say, "Si, si" (dale)
Love on the street like, yeah oh yeah
I'm a freak like that (dale)
And I ain't fair, but if it's fair
Then yeah, I'll eat like that (dale)
I'mma roll with things you can't even imagine
Or, even fathom (dale)
And I ain't got no fan, but once I hit, I'm gone
I'm phantom (dale)
Baby, you're my Eve, he's your Adam
And I'm your snake (dale)
So here's your apple
Wanna play chess? Check mate




Break that shit down (dale)
Break that thang down (dale) 
Let me see ya work (Go, go!) 
Let me see ya work (Work, work, work)




The king is here
Shake yo ass, ay mi madre
Todo eso culo, shake yo ass
Entonces dale 


Let me see ya work
(Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work!)
