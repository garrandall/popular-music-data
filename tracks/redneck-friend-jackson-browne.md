Pretty little one
How has it all begun?
They're teaching you how to walk
But you're already on the run
Little one-
What you gonna do?
Little one-
Honey, it's all up to you

Now your daddy's in the den shootin' up the evening news
Mama's with a friend, lately she's been so confused
Little one-
Come on and take my hand
I may not have the answer but I believe I got a plan

Honey you shake and I'll rattle and we'll roll on down the line
And see if we can't get in touch with a very close friend of mine
But let me clue you in, it ain't like him
To argue or pretend-
Honey let me introduce you to my redneck friend

Well they've got a little list of all those things of which they don't approve
They've got to keep their eyes on you or you might make your move
Little one-
I really wish you would
Little one-
I think the damage would do you good

Honey you shake and I'll rattle and we'll roll on down the line
We're going to forget all about the battle
It's gonna feel so fine
'Cause he's the missing link, the kitchen sink-
Eleven on a scale of ten
Honey let me introduce you to my redneck friend

Honey you shake and I'll rattle and we'll roll on down the line
I'm going to try to swing you up into my saddle
And then we'll run but you'll think we're flyin'
Now honey don't just stand there
Lookin' like this dream will never end
Honey let me introduce you to my redneck friend
