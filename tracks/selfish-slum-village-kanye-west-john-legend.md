I'm calling (yeah, maybe I'm selfish)
Out to (I want you to myself, I can't help it)
All my (yeah, maybe I'm selfish)
Y'all my ladies
And I can't (maybe I'm selfish)
Let you, let you (I want you to myself, I can't help it)
Be with (yeah) no one (yeah)
But me (yeah) baby


Come on, to my thick chicks down in Texas
All the way to New Orleans where the girls cook catfish
And in L.A., every chick's an actress
Hollywood status with the shaded glasses
To Detroit, yeah the place that I rest
Where the ladies got ass and symbolize sex
And hot Atlanta, y'all is one of the best
Where they speak Southern slang and smoke la cess
And New York, women are way too fresh
Too much on your mind, let me ease that stress
I wish you all were mine, it's so selfish
Maybe I'm feeling myself too much, I guess
But, to my ladies all across the globe
In small towns that I don't even know
To all local international codes
Whether you see me in streets or catch me at shows
I'm calling


I'm calling (yeah, maybe I'm selfish)
Out to (I want you to myself, I can't help it)
All my (yeah, maybe I'm selfish)
Y'all my ladies
And I can't (maybe I'm selfish)
Let you, let you (I want you to myself, I can't help it)
Be with (yeah) no one (yeah)
But me (yeah) baby


Uh, and don't be tryna come around my girl actin' like Mr. Friendly
And steal the spotlight like Mr. Bentley
I spotted her like Spud McKenzie
And for them fake boobies, I paid them Benjis
Get your own
I got Paris, he got Nicky, he tried to get 'em a clone
He said, "Ye, you know you got extra hoes
And everything you do is extra cold"
From the Polo fleece to the Jesus piece
I got family in high places like Jesus' niece
Can I please, say my peace?
If y'all fresh to death, then I'm deceased
And this one here is a heatrocks, spit like a beat box
The way the beat rocks, new version of Pete Rock
But for that Benz, I get CL love
So I switch my girls around like 3L-dub, I'm calling


I'm calling (yeah, maybe I'm selfish)
Out to (I want you to myself, I can't help it)
All my (yeah, maybe I'm selfish)
Y'all my ladies
And I can't (maybe I'm selfish)
Let you, let you (I want you to myself, I can't help it)
Be with (yeah) no one (yeah)
But me (yeah) baby


What up Pam? How your little man doing in New Jersey?
Last I heard he caught the flu and you was worried
Hope he feels better, and thanks Jonetta from Cleveland
For that good head in your Jetta, better believe it
Shanice, you're my piece from Compton, before I'm off the plane
Make sure you cop some trees to spark up
Danielle, ATL, got them pictures in the mail
You sealed with a kiss and you sent it with Chanel
You looking good in that one showing off your body
Had a Beverly Hills mami that would buy me Cartis
Take me to afterparties, her name was Khari
And it sucks that we didn't keep in touch, I'm sorry
But, hey Kim, how's Minneapolis?
You so pretty, hate you show off your titties for silly classes
Cause I love you girls, though you ain't mine
I wish my arms was long enough to hug you all of the same time


I'm calling (yeah, maybe I'm selfish)
Out to (I want you to myself, I can't help it)
All my (yeah, maybe I'm selfish)
Y'all my ladies
And I can't (maybe I'm selfish)
Let you, let you (I want you to myself, I can't help it)
Be with (yeah) no one (yeah)
But me (yeah) baby


I'm calling (calling)
Out to (out to)
All my (all my)
Y'all my ladies
And I can't (I can't)
Let you (let you)
Be with no one
But me, baby
