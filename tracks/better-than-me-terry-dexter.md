I know I wanna spend my life with you


I wanna spend my life with you
You're so remarkable

I never quite told you this
How much you meant to me?
From first sight that first night
I knew instantly
That you'd be the one for me
Deep down in my heart baby, oh yeah

Eyes,forbidding wanna be'S
Sat by me real casually
Asked you if you'd like a drink
Instead you offered one to me
Got the number to the crib cell job
Couldn't believe you'd even talk to me
All I can say ooh


You're love is so remarkable
Everything about you from head to toe
Babygirl you're so incredible
I just had to let you know
You're love is so remarkable
And I don't wanna let you go
If you left I'd be so miserable
You're good for my heart, my mind, my soul
You make me whole


Girl I know I've put you through things
But I love you more each day
And I doubt it ever gon' change, no
If you ever left me, nothing would remain
You're part of me, no you're all of me
Girl I'm my knees holding this here ring
And I beg you please spend your life with me, yeah
All I'll ever need to survive is right here in my eyes




There's always sunshine when you're around
It's like my feet don't even touch the ground, ooh


How my heart begins to pound
On one knee I will go down, grab your hand
And tell you now


You will always be all that I'll never need
Much more than my baby or an angel heaven sent to me


Once was blind but now I see
(Never let your love get away from)
Will you marry me?
(Ooh I will)
