It's very ordinary for the secretary
To take a man away from his wife
Girls, we make it necessary
For the secretary to put
A little joy in his life

She takes the time to listen
To what he has to say
While all you do is nag him
A thousand times a day

Her hair is always pretty
And her clothes are always stylish
But you greet him with
Your hair in rollers and
That's outdated and so childish

Oh, it's very ordinary for the secretary
To take a man away from his wife
We make it necessary
For the secretary to put
A little joy in his life

Are you there when he needs you
Are your favors less then cute
And when he tries to love you

Do you find something else to do

Now the ordinary girl
May not wear pearls
Or diamonds on each hand
Oh, but like the secretary, woo
She knows how to please her man

Oh, it's not extraordinary
For the secretary
To take a man away from his wife
You see, we make it necessary
For the secretary to put
A little joy in his life, hey, hey

You see, life's a bowl of cherries
For all the secretaries, hey, hey

Oh, it's very ordinary
It's not extraordinary
Girls, don't be contrary
Or you'll make it necessary

'Cause life can be so merry
Just like the secretary
