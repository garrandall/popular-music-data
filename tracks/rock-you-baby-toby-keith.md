Met you in a cafÃ©
At a table meant for two
You were sitting by your lonesome
When I sat down with you
You tried hard not to show it
But I couldn't help but see
That you wore your broken heart out on your sleeve

And your loneliness could not disguise the beauty and the charm
Thought, if I ever get you, shattered lady, in my arms

I'm gonna rock you, baby, to sleep
I'm gonna make you crazy over me
I'm gonna hold you like you've never been held before
And love you 'til you tell me you can't love anymore

I'm gonna shake your emotion right down to your soul
And then I'm gonna love you all over in and out of control
If this is how love is supposed to feel
Baby, I know I've fallen head over heels
I'm gonna rock you, baby

Over open conversation and a bottle of red wine
You said this world is full of users and I know that I've had mine
We danced a little slow dance until they closed that cafÃ© down
You said, 'What would be the chances that tonight I finally found
Someone who makes me feel like my life is just begun?'
I said, 'Girl, believe in me and I'll show you how it's done.'

I'm gonna rock you, baby, to sleep
I'm gonna make you crazy over me
I'm gonna hold you like you've never been held before
And love you 'til you tell me you can't love anymore

I'm gonna shake your emotion right down to your soul
Then I'm gonna love you all over in and out of control
If this is how love is supposed to feel
Oh, baby, I know I've fallen head over heels
I'm gonna rock you, baby
