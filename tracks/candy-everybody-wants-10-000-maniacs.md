Hey, hey, give 'em what they want


If lust and hate is the candy
If blood and love tastes so sweet
Then we give 'em what they want


Hey, hey, give 'em what they want


So their eyes are growing hazy
'Cause they wanna turn it on
So their minds are soft and lazy
Well


Hey, hey, give 'em what they want


If lust and hate is the candy
If blood and love tastes so sweet
Then we give 'em what they want


So their eyes are growing hazy
'Cause they wanna turn it on
So their minds are soft and lazy
Well
Who do you want to blame?


Hey, hey, give 'em what they want


If lust and hate is the candy
If blood and love tastes so sweet
Then we give 'em what they want


So their eyes are growing hazy
'Cause they wanna turn it on
So their minds are soft and lazy
Well
Who do you want to blame?
