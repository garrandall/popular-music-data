'Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony this life
Tryna make ends meet, you're a slave to the money then you die
I'll take you down the only road I have ever been down
You know the one that takes you to the places where all the thins meet, yeah

And I'll change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I am here in my mode, here in my mode
I am a million different people from one day to the next
I can change my mode, no, no, no, no, no

Well I never prayed but tonight I'm on my knees, yeah
I need to hear some sounds that recognizes pain in me, yeah
I let the melody shine let it cleanse my mind I feel free now
But the airway's clean and there's nobody's singing to me now

And I'll change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I am here in my mode, here in my mode
I am a million different people from one day to the next
I can change my mode, no, no, no, no, no
Have you ever been down
Have you ever been down

'Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony this life
Tryna make ends meet, you're a slave to the money then you die
I know I cannot change, I can change and I'm here in my
I'll take you down the only road I have ever been down

And I'll change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I am here in my mode, here in my mode
I am a million different people from one day to the next
I can change my mode, no, no, no, no, no
