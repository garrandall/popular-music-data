Baby whatcha gonna do
Go ahead and make your move
First you say ya love me
Say you'll never leave me
Now you say that we are through

It's a tough world
Ain't it a rough world

Without love it's true
I don't know what I would do
So if you're gonna leave me
Go ahead and leave me
'Cause I'm gonna find somebody new

It's a tough world
Ain't it a rough world
It's a tough world rough world stab it in the back world
Tough world
It's a hard world cold world hit you where it hurts world
Rough world... Tough world
It's a tough life rough life try to make a buck life
Tough life
Get a job hotshot make it to the top
Rough life... tough life

I'm gonna hold my chin up high
I'm gonna walk right out the door
And I'm gonna make it
Yeah I'm gonna make it
'Cause I don't need you anymore
