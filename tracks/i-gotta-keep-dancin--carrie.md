Keep on dancing
Do do do, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keep on smiling
Do do do, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keep on dancing
Do do do, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keep on smiling
Do do do, yeah, yeah, yeah


Body began to spin
Please help me pretend
That I don't see
Who just walked in the door

I'm weak in the knees
But I gotta make believe
That I'm hurt free
I just can't let him know
That my heart is breaking apart
Music, rescue me


I gotta keep dancing (keep dancing)
Smiling (keep smiling)
To keep from breaking apart
I gotta keep dancing (keep dancing)
Smiling (keep smiling)
To cover up my broken heart

Don't let the music stop
I've gotta camouflage my feelings
He's not here with me

I should have known
That I never should
Have come to the party
I must listen to the beat
Music, can you take my away
Help me hide the pain


I gotta keep dancing (keep dancing)
Smiling (keep smiling)
To keep from breaking apart
I gotta keep dancing (keep dancing)
Smiling (keep smiling)
To cover up my broken heart

Don't let the music stop
I've gotta camouflage my feelings
He's not here with me

I should have known
That I never should
Have come to the party
I must listen to the beat

Music, can you take my away
Help me hide the pain


I gotta keep dancing (keep dancing)
Smiling (keep smiling)
To keep from breaking apart
I gotta keep dancing (keep dancing)
Smiling (keep smiling)
To cover up my broken heart

I gotta keep dancing (keep dancing)
Smiling (keep smiling)
To keep from breaking apart
I gotta keep dancing (keep dancing)
Smiling (keep smiling)
To cover up my broken heart

I gotta keep dancing (keep dancing)
Smiling (keep smiling)
To keep from breaking apart
I gotta keep dancing (keep dancing)
Smiling (keep smiling)
To cover up my broken heart

I gotta keep dancing (keep dancing)
