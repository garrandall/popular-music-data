Let it go, let it go
Can’t hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door


The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen
The wind is howling like the swirling storm inside
Couldn’t keep it in, Heaven knows I tried


Don’t let them in, don’t let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don’t feel, don’t let them know
Well, now they know


Let it go, let it go
Can’t hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And here I stand, and here I'll stay
Let it go, let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway


It’s funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can’t get to me at all
Up here in the cold thin air
I finally can breathe
I know left a life behind
But I’m too relieved to grieve


Let it go, let it go
Can’t hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And here I stand, and here I'll stay
Let it go, let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway


Standing frozen in the life I’ve chosen
You won't find me, the past is so behind me
Buried in the snow


Let it go, let it go
Can’t hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And here I stand, and here I'll stay
Let it go, let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway


(Na na, na na) Yeah
(Na na na na na) Let it go
(Na na, na na) Yeah
(Na na na na na) Na na
(Na na, na na) Let it go
(Na na na na na) Let it go
(Na na) Let it go
(Na na) Ooh
(Na na na na na) Let it go
