Though I'm missing you
(Although I'm missing you)
I'll find away to get through
(I'll find away to get through)
Living without you
Cause you were my sister, my strength and my pride
Only god may know why, still I will get by


Who would've known, that you have to go
So suddenly, so fast
How could it be that sweet memories
Would be all, all that we have left?
Now that you're gone, every day I go on (I go on)
But life's just not the same (life's just not the same)
I'm so empty inside, and my tears I can't hide
But I'll try, I'll to face the pain


Though I'm missing you
(Although I'm missing you)
I'll find away to get through
(I'll find away to get through)
Living without you
Cause you were my sister, my strength and my pride
Only God may know why, still I will get by


Oh there was so many things
That we could have said, uh-huh
If time was on our side (time was on our side)
Ooh, yeah
Now that you're gone, I can still feel you near
So I'll smile, with every tear I cry


Though I'm missing you
(Although I'm missing you)
I'll find away to go through
(I'll find away to get through)
Living without you
Cause you were my sister, my strength and my pride
Only God may know why, still I will get by


How sweet were the losses to spare?
But I'll wait for the day
When I'll see you again, see you again, yeah


Though I'm missing you
(Although I'm missing you)
I'll find away to get through
(I'll find away to get through)
Living without you
Cause you were my sister, my strength and my pride
Only god may know why, still I will get by


I'm missing you
