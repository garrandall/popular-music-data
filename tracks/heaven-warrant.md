I've got a picture of your house
And you`re standing by the door
It`s black and white and faded
And it`s looking pretty worn

See the factory that I worked
Silhouetted in the back
The memories are gray
But man, they`re really coming back
I don`t need to be the king of the world
As long as I`m the hero of this little girl

Heaven isn`t too far away
Closer to it every day
No matter what your friends might say
We`ll find a way

How I love the way you move
And the sparkle in your eyes
There`s a color deep inside them
Like a blue surburban sky

When I come home late at night
And you`re in bed asleep
I wrap my arms around you
So I can feel you breathe
I don`t need to be a superman, ah ah
As long as you will always be my biggest fan

Heaven isn`t too far away
Closer to it every day
No matter what your friends might say
We`ll find a way

Now the lights are going out
Along the boulevard
The memories come rushing back
And it makes it pretty hard

I`ve got nowhere left to go
And no one really cares
I don`t know what to do
But I`m never giving up on you

Heaven isn`t too far away
Closer to it every day
No matter what your friends might say
Yeah, we`re gonna find a way

Heaven
Whoa oh, oh, oh, oh
Heaven
Whoa oh, oh, oh, oh oh

Heaven
It`s not too far away
Eh yeah
It`s not too far away
It`s not too far away
It`s not too far away
It`s not too far away
It`s not too far away
