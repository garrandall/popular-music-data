My heart cries for you
Sighs for you, dies for you
My arms long for you
Please come back to me

If you're in Arizona, I'll follow you
If you're in Minnesota, I'll be there too
You'll have a milllion chances to start anew
For my love is endless for you

That's why I say that
My heart cries for you
Sighs for you, dies for you
My arms long for you
Please come back to me

An unimportant quarrel is what we had
We have to learn to live the good and bad
Together we were happy, apart we're sad
You know this lonliness is driving me mad

That's why I say that
My heart cries for you
Sighs for you, dies for you
I say that my arms long for you
Please come back to me

My heart cries for you
Sighs for you, dies for you
I say that my arms long for you
Please come back to me
