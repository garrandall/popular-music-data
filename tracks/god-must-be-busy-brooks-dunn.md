That anchorman says they're fighting again
Somewhere in the Middle East 
The world prays for peace
There's a single mom, just got laid off
Went and lost her job to foreign hands
In some far away land
Last night in Oklahoma
Some twister took thirteen
And they're praying they find the missing three
God must be busy

That highway sign went from slow ahead
To traffic's dead, thought it couldn't get worse
Then that Amber alert
They say she's four, Colorado plates
Heading out of state in a Chevy van
It's hard to understand
You can see it in the faces
Of all those highway strangers
They're praying that God keeps girl from danger
God must be busy

And I know in the big picture
I'm just a speck of sand
And God's got better things to do
Than look out for one man
I know He's heard my prayers
'Cause He hears everything
He just ain't answered back or He'd bring you back to me
God must be busy

The evening news ain't much changed
Pretty much the same since I left home
Yeah, that war's still on
They found that little girl
She was soaking wet, half scared to death
On the side of some road
Them prayers work ya know

And the blood and the cripes are at it
And there's a killer drought down south
And old folks can't afford the drugs they can't live without
God must be busy

And I know in the big picture
I'm just a speck of sand
And God's got better things to do
Than look out for one man
I know He's heard my prayers
'Cause He hears everything
He just ain't answered back or He'd bring you back to me
God must be busy

That anchorman says the fighting's worse
Cities burn in the Middle East
The world prays for peace
