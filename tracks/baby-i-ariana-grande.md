Baby, I got love for thee so deep inside of me
I don't know where to start
Yeah, yeah
I love you more than anything
But the words can't even touch what's in my heart
No, no


When I try to explain it, I be sounding insane
The words don't ever come out right
I get all tongue-tied and twisted
I can't explain what I'm feeling
And I say baby, baby (oh-woah, oh-woah), baby


(Baby, I) Oh baby, oh baby, my baby
(Baby, I) Oh baby, baby, I
(Baby, I) All I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby
But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it
Baby, baby (oh-woah, oh-woah)


Baby, I'm so down for you
No matter what you do (real talk), I'll be around
Yeah, yeah
Oh, baby
Baby, I been feeling you before I even knew what feelings were about
Oh, baby


When I try to explain it, I be sounding all crazy
Words don't ever come out right
I get all tongue-tied and (twisted)
I can't explain what I'm (feeling)
And I say baby, baby (oh-woah, oh-woah), baby


(Baby, I) Oh baby, oh baby, my baby
(Baby, I) Oh baby, baby, I
(Baby, I) All I'm tryna say is you're my everything, (baby)
But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it
Baby, baby (oh-woah, oh-woah)
(Baby, baby) Oh-woah


Straight up
You got me all in
How could I not be?
I sure hope you know (I sure hope you know)
If it's even possible, I love you more than the word “love” can say, yeah
It's better not explaining
That's why I keep saying


(Baby, I) Oh baby, oh baby, my baby
(Baby, I) Oh baby, baby, I
(Baby, I) All I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby
But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it
Baby, baby (oh-woah, oh-woah)
Baby (baby, baby), baby, I
Oh baby, oh baby, my baby
(Baby, I) Oh baby, baby, I
(Baby, I) All I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby
But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it
Every time I try to say it words, they only complicate it
Every time I try to say it words, they only complicate it
Baby, baby (oh-woah, oh-woah)
Baby, baby
