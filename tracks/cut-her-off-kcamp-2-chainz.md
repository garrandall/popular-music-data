It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
So what you saying ho? You know I'm the man ho
Nothing but a bird, I'ma leave you where you stand, ho
Heard you got a man ho, hope he understand though
You ain't nothing but a creeper baby, I'm just saying though
Saying though, aye, it ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off


Creeping on the low, hope your man don't see
She will bust it down for some damn Lime-A-Ritas
Chew me like some bubblegum, something like Rasheeda
Gotta get my partner some, she on me like Adidas
Baby, you can't hold back, better stop flexing like you not
Your man tryna patrol then I guess he is a cop
But he really can't cuff if he busting at my spot
But I done had enough cause you making my shit hot
Blowing up a nigga phone, what I tell yo ass 'bout that?
Tryna hold something, hold my nuts, can you do that?
Can you play around with that mouth while he hit it from the back?
You can't say nothing now cause we all been through that, through that


It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
So what you saying ho? You know I'm the man ho
So what you saying ho? You know I'm the man ho


You know that ain't a real bag bitch, that's a knock off
When I get that work I get to juggin' like hot sauce
All swimmin pool lakefront
Hit it from the back, rearrange her lace front
Stuntin', tattoos on my neck and on my kidney
If I don't like that ho I turn her ass into a frisbee
If I dont like your disc I turn that ho into a frisbee
I throw it out on Old Nat right by the Wendy’s
Three cellphones and all of 'em jumpin'
I can see your hoes and all em' nothing
Yeah I'm a don don', Don Cheadle, Don Cornelius
Watch the Dom spill
Pockets fat as Don Cartagena, nigga, done deal!


It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
So what you saying ho? You know I'm the man ho
So what you saying ho? You know I'm the man ho


Baby I'm ashamed, why you acting this way?
Heard she 'bout that action, you can bring her this way
Hit her on yo mattress, make you feel some type of way
Pass her to my migos, they gonna bust it, ¡Andale!
Please don't play no games cause I know thats what you like
Knock it out the frame, baby girl, it's alright
Yeah that pussy bomb, I just call it dynamite
You ready? Here I come, I can do this shit all night


It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
So what you saying ho? You know I'm the man ho
Nothing but a bird, I'ma leave you where you stand, ho
Heard you got a man ho, hope he understand though
You ain't nothing but a creeper baby, I'm just saying though
Saying though, aye, it ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
