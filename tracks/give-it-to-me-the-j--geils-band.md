Yeah, now don't touch the knobs
Cause I think we're gonna
Have some with this one here

Oh, yeah
You got to give it to me
You got to give it to me
You got to give it to me
You got to give it to me

You're so slick, honey
Know every trick now
You know I want it
I want it so bad
You know I need it
I can't believe it
So come on baby
Please relieve it

Got to give it to me
You got to give it to me
Got to give it to me
You got to give it to me

You've been bugging me
Every night now
You say you want it
You want it right now
I can't get through it
And I can't get to it
So come on, baby, please

Got to get it up (get it up)
Come on, you got to
Get it up (get it up)
You got to get it up (get it up)
Babe, you got to give it to me
(Give it to me)
You got to give it to me
(Give it to me)
You got to give it to me
(Give it to me)
You got to give it to me
(Give it to me)

Why keep me cold
When it's so warm inside
Come on, baby, your love
Is too good to hide
Woah, yeah
