Two feets, they come a creepin'
Like a black cat do
And two bodies are layin' naked
A creeper think he got nothin' to lose


So he creeps into this house, yeah
And unlocks the door
An' as the man's reaching for his trousers
He shoots him full of 38 holes


Mister Saturday Night Special
Got a barrel that's blue and cold
It ain't good for nothing but puttin' men six feet in a hole


Big Jim's been drinking whiskey
And playing poker on a losing night
An' pretty soon, Ol' Jim starts a-thinkin'
Somebody been cheatin' and lyin'
So Big Jim commence to fighting
I wouldn't tell you no lie
Big Jim done pulled his pistol
Shot his friend right between the eyes


Mister Saturday Night Special
Got a barrel that's blue and cold
It ain't good for nothing but puttin' men six feet in a hole


Hmm, and that's the Saturday Night Special
For twenty dollars, you can buy yourself one, too

Here it come



Oh, lemme tell you all about it


Hand guns are made for killing
They ain't no good for nothing else
And if you like to drink your whiskey
You might even shoot yourself


So why don't we dump 'em, people, to the bottom of the sea?
Before some old fool come around here
Wanna shoot either you, or me


Mister Saturday Night Special
You got a barrel that's blue and cold
You ain't good for nothing but puttin' men six feet in a hole


It's a Saturday Night Special
And I'd like to tell you what you can do with it, too
And that's the end of this song
