Early every morning
Early every evening too
Early every morning
Early every evening too
I get so lonesome for you
That I don't know what to do

Well, you told me
You would leave me
You told me
You would go away

Ah, you told me
You would need me
Told me
You would go away

I told you
You were lying
And I don't believe
A word you say

You told me you would leave me
I told you you could go
I told you a lot
Because I love you so

Early every morning
Early every evening too
Early every morning
Early every evening too
I get so lonesome for you
That I don't know what to do

You told me you would leave me
I told you you could go
I told you a lot
Because I hate you so

Early every morning
Early every evening too
Early every morning
Early every evening too
I get so lonesome for you
That I don't know what to do
