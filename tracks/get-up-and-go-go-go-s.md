Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!


If you get up and walk away
Leave the past behind
Go ahead and take a ride
No telling what you'll find
The words you say don't mean a thing
They fly right by my eyes
Look in the mirror, don't look at me
Maybe then you'll realize


Oh
Oh
So get up and go
If you're so tired of moving slow
Go
If you're so tired of moving slow
Go
Get up and go


I was on the inside
Just looking out for you
But you're the one to make a change
There's nothing I can do
Now's the time for you to move
Actions shout out loud
So cut the talk and move your feet
'Cause words get lost in crowds


Quit talking
Start walking now
Quit talking
Start walking now


So get up and go
If you're so tired of moving slow
Go
If you're so tired of moving slow
Go
Get up and go


Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

Go
Get up and go
Go
Get up and go
Go
Get up and go
Go
Get up and go


So get up and go
If you're so tired of moving slow
Go
If you're so tired of moving slow
Go
If you're so tired of moving slow
Go
If you're so tired of moving slow
Go
Get up and go
Go!
