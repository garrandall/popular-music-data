Beat the clock. Try to make it stop
Before time can draw the line
And cut you down to her size
Beat the clock. Try to make it stop
Tell me how long will it take
Before you finally realize

That the carnival is over
And you've seen much better days
You have wasted too much time
Into many different plays

You deny the possibility
Of growing old
You are filled with false humility
You're much too bold

Beat the clock. Try to make it stop
Before time can draw the line
And cut you down to her size
Beat the clock. Try to make it stop
Tell me how long will it take
Before you finally realize

That you're in this game same as me
Although you think you're not
When you try to rise above it all
You get just what you got

It seems to me you're slipping
You seem slightly unnerved
When you finally see yourself
You get what you deserve

Beat the clock. Try to make it stop
Before time can draw the line
And cut you down to her size
Beat the clock. Try to make it stop
Tell me how long will it take
Before you finally realize

That the carnival is over
And you've seen much better days
You have wasted too much time
Into many different plays

You deny the possibility
Of growing old
You are filled with false humility
You're much too bold
