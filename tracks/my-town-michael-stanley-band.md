This old town's been home long as I remember
This town's gonna be here long after I'm gone
East side, West side--give up, or surrender
--been down,
ButI still rock on...

Oh, and this town
Is my town--alright?
Love or hate it--it don't matter
'Cause I'm gonna stand and fight
This town--is my town
She's got her ups and downs
But love or hate it--it don't matter
'Cause this is my town

This old town is where I learned about lovin'
This old town is where I learned to hate
This town, buddy, has done its share of shovin'
This town taught me
That it's never too late

Oh, and this town
Is my town--alright?
Love or hate it--it don't matter
'Cause I'm gonna stand and fight
This town--is my town
She's got her ups and downs
But love or hate it--it don't matter
'Cause this is my town

Oh, and this town
Is my town--alright?
Love or hate it--it don't matter
'Cause I'm gonna stand and fight
This town--is my town
She's got her ups and downs
But love or hate it--it don't matter
'Cause this is my town

This is MY TOWN
This is MY TOWN
This is MY TOWN...
