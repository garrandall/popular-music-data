The fire of love
Is burning deep
The fire of love
Won't let me sleep
Oh my love
Hear this my plea
Because of you
It's burning me

The sun beats down
With it's fiery glow
Knows I won't see
My love no more
I'm sorry for
The things I've done
Forgive me dear
My only one

My baby's back
Once more she's mine
To have and hold
'Til end of time
The moon shines down
From up above
It's light to cool
The fire of love

The fire of love
The fire of love
The fire of love
