Q-Vo, aqui estoy, MC Kid Frost
Yo soy jefe, patron, yes, the big boss
My cuete's loaded, it's full of balas
I put it in your face and you won't say nada
Vatos, cholos, you call us what you will
You say we are assassins an we are sent to kill
It's in my blood to be an Aztec Warrior
Go to any extreme and hold no barriers
Chicano and I'm Brown and I'm proud
Guantes, chingaso, simon, ese letâ€™s get down
Right now, in the dirt
What's the matter? You afraid you're gonna get hurt?
I'm with my homeboys, my camaradas
Kickin' back con mi ganga y para mi no vale nada
Yo soy chingon ese, like Al Capone ese
Controlo a todos solo never try to sweat me
Some of you don't know what's happening que pasa
It's not for you anyway, cuz this is for the Raza


This for La Raza, Raza
This for La Raza, Raza


The foreign tongue I 'm speaking is known s  alo
Y sabes que loco? Yo soy muy malo
Tu no sabes nada, your brains is hallow
Been hit in the head too many times with a palo
Still you trying to act cool, but you should know
You're so cool that I'mma call you a culo
You 're just a pee-wee, you can 't get none ever
You're on the leva
Your own barrio doesn't back you up
They just look at your ass and call you a poo butt
And so I look and I laugh and say que pasa
Yeah, this is for the Raza

Cruising in the calle, headed for the bolo
No want to go with me, so I had to go solo
And when I go out alone I'm packed
I don 't sweat the chavalas when I know that I 'm strapped
Every time that I pack my piece
I pull it out quick, all the nonsense will cease
Just like the song when you're 18 With A Bullet
Got my finger on a trigger, I'm not afraid to pull it
If it gets out of hand I know some mafiosos
Who can pull out cuetes on some stupid ass babosos
Sitting there wondering what's happened, que pasa
Yeah, this is for the Raza
