It's been three years and seven days
Since I first gave my all to you
Stuck up in love so wrong
I can't see nothin' else but me and you

A sudden change has come about
The way you treat me, I need you
Can't stop the rain from comin' down
Until you see it's true that

No one's gonna love you (Like I do it)
Late at night, baby (Like I do)
I get up early in the mornin' (To please you and), oh, yeah, yeah
And make sure that you're satisfied

(Don't run away from lovin')
(Love is) All I have for you
(Don't turn away from us)
(No one will) Love you like I do

It's been to me a time alone
'Cause I've been more than there for you
Don't want to leave, can't bear the thought
Of what goes on, we are through

Too may reasons we should stay
We built a world between us two
But if you need to go away
Then, baby, you will see that

No one's gonna love you (Like I do it), oh
Late at night, baby (Like I do)
I get up early in the mornin' (To please you and)
And make sure that you're satisfied

(Don't run away from lovin') Don't run away
(Love is) All I have for you
(Don't turn away from us) Don't turn away
(No one will) Oh, no, it's all I can do

(Don't run away from lovin') Oh
(Love is) It's all I have for you
(Don't turn away from us) Don't turn away
(No one will) Love you like I do

(Like I do it)
Late at night, baby (Like I do)
I get up early in the mornin' (To please you and), hey
And make sure that you're satisfied

(Don't run away from lovin') Don't run away, no, no, no
(Love is) Oh, it's all I have for you, boy
(Don't turn away from us) Don't turn away
(No one will) No one will love you like I do

(Don't run away from lovin') No, like I do, not like I do, baby
(Love is) It's all I have for you
(Don't turn away from us) No, no, oh, no
(No one will) No one will love you like I do

(Don't run away from lovin') Don't turn away
(Love is) Baby, it's all I have for you
(Don't turn away from us)
(No one will) No one will love you like I do

(Don't run away from lovin')
(Love is)
