It's gonna be a party y'all
Keith Murray rock vibes, verse you with Universal
Where no one come, combine with R. Kelly and prove it can be done
Non stoppin' Def Squad and Rockland
I hear somebody knockin', yo R the party's startin'
Yo, yo who's dat?


Step into the crib with me tonight (What's up baby)
Kelly's in the mood to make it right
Word is gettin' all over town
The party's over here and gettin' down, yeah

 - Hands in the air
Drinks everywhere
Party in the hills
Keepin' it real
Parents out of town 
Ladies all around
Me and the crew doin' what we do

Yeah, beat is bangin' up and down your spine
And all the single women here are fine
(It's a beautiful thing, it's a beautiful thing)
Let your body give into your soul
Release the freak in you and lose control

 - Girl there's a party goin' on
My temperature's warm
So let me freak you through the floor
While the bass is bumpin'
All night if your body can handle




Chillin' at the house on the hill
You gotta say my my my like Johnny Gill
Hey, rich girl, poor girl get the same respect
You can all drink for free and call Earl collect
At the moment of truth with burden of proof
We stack so you can spread love like I chose
The lyrical genius with the R&B messiah
And the roof, the roof we sets on fire
But as long as the party is jumpin, we ain't concerned
We don't need no water let the motherfucker burn
And everybody who was somebody was there
With they hands in the air bringing in the new year
Yeah, ay yo, come on

Baguettes on the wrist, it's just for shine
Cuz ain't nobody checkin' out the time
Cash and clothes for days to blow your mind
Baby it's all good so dance tonight



All we want is a party
A reason to celebrate
Now that we got the money, oh yeah
We dance the night away
Nothing but the hands up
