We scratched our names
In that oak tree
'Cause I loved you
And you loved me
A jagged little heart so the whole town knew it
Carved into the bark with an arrow through it
Well, I came out here to see it one more time

And I got my chainsaw
Oh, you know it's got to go, it's such a shame y'all
But I ain't gonna be happy 'til those names fall
And I'm sittin' on a stump

Love is shady
Love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet
Holdin' a chainsaw

I guess all those years
They don't mean a thing
Now I can't wait
To count those rings
Nothing left of us but dust and splinters
A big pile of wood to keep me warm through the winter
'Cause I, I don't have you

But I got my chainsaw
Oh, you know it's got to go, it's such a shame y'all
But I ain't gonna be happy 'til those names fall
And I'm sittin' on a stump

Love is shady
Love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet
Holdin' a chainsaw

Just holding a little chainsaw

I remember what you said that night
That you would love me for the rest of your life
We wrote "Forever" with a pocket knife
But forever's goin' down tonight

'Cause I got my chainsaw
It's got to go, it's such a shame y'all
And I ain't gonna be happy 'til those names fall
And I'm sittin' on a stump


Love is shady
Love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet

Holdin' a chainsaw
