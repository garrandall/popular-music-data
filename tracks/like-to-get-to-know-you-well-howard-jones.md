Like to get to know you well
Like to get to know you well
Like to get to know you well
So we can be one
We can be one together

Like to get to know you well
Like to get to know you well
Like to get to know you well
So we can be one
We can be one together

Together

Together we can cast away the fear
Together we can wipe away the tear
Together we can strip down the barriers
And be one

Don't wanna talk about the weather
Don't wanna talk about the news
Just wanna get to the real you inside

Like to get to know you well
Like to get to know you well
Like to get to know you well
So we can be one
We can be one together

Like to get to know you well
Like to get to know you well
Like to get to know you well
So we can be one
We can be one together

Don't you think now is the time
We should be feelin'
Just wanna simply say
Won't let you slip away

People wanna talk about the future
Don't wanna linger on the past
Just wanna reach the real you inside
Forget cold glances and rejections
Leave the things that separate
Build on a trust that we must stand on

Like to get to know you well
Like to get to know you well
Like to get to know you well
So we can be one
We can be one together

Together

Finding all are insecure
Opening the same door
Leaving out a stubborn pride
Seeing from the other side

Like to get to know you well
Like to get to know you well
Like to get to know you well
So we can be one
We can be one together

Like to get to know you well
Like to get to know you well
Like to get to know you well
So we can be one
We can be one together

Like to get to know you well
Like to get to know you well
Like to get to know you well
So we can be one
We can be one together

Like to get to know you well
Like to get to know you well
Like to get to know you well
So we can be one
We can be one together

Like to get to know you well
Like to get to know you well
Like to get to know you well
So we can be one
We can be one together
