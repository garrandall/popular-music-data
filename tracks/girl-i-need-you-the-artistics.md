You went away and
Left me for another
And now you're back
And you're trying to recover

Our love was good
Until I had to discover
That you went away
And now he's your lover

But, girl, I need you
(Hey, girl, I need you)
I got to have you in my arms
(Hey, girl, I need you)
(Hey, girl, I love you)
And I want all of your
Sweet charms, yeah, yeah

(I'm glad I met you) mm hmm
(Overjoyed to get you)
Would you believe
(Hey, girl, you're so fine)
Oh, yeah (my time is your time)

Though you're no good for me
I want you by my side
And all for your love
I'll forget my pride

Turn my back on my friends
Don't listen to what they say
I've got to have your love
Any old way

(Hey, girl, I need you)
I got to have you in my arms
(Hey, girl, I need you)
(Hey, girl, I love you)
I got to have all of your
Sweet charms, yeah, yeah

(Hey, girl, I love you) mm hmm
(Can't live without you)
Would you believe
(I love every) oh, yeah
(Little thing about you)

I'm a fool, I must admit
Cause your sweet love
I just can't forget
I can't explain
What you do to me
All I know is I can't
Let you be

(I'm glad I met you)
There's no use
Trying to deny it
(Overjoyed to get you)
Cause my heart just won't
(Hey, girl, you're so fine)
Let me buy it
(My time is your time)
Oh, yeah

(Hey, girl, I love you)...
