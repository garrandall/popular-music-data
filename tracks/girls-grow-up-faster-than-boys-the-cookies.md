Girls grow up faster than boys do
Girls grow up faster than boys

Girls grow up faster than boys do
So, baby, I'm old enough for you
Once you used to date my big sister
Now, baby, she's too old for you

Won't you take a look at me now
You'll be surprised at what you see now
I'm everything a girl should be now
Thirty-six, twenty-one, thirty-five

I'll tell you
Girls grow up faster than boys do
So, baby, I'm old enough for you

Won't you take a look at me now
You'll be surprised at what you see now
I'm everything a girl should be now
Thirty-six, twenty-one, thirty-five

I'll tell you
Girls grow up faster than boys do
So, baby, I'm old enough for you

Girls grow up faster than boys do
Girls grow up faster than boys do
Girls grow up faster than boys do...
