Tell him "no", oh-oh-oh
Tell him "no", oh-oh-oh
When he asks for a date, tell him no-oh-oh-oh
Tell him "no"

Tell him "no", oh-oh-oh
Tell him "no", oh-oh-oh
When he asks for a kiss, tell him no-oh-oh-oh
Tell him "no"

It's all right to go to a party
It's all right to have some fu-un
It's all right to take in a movie
But don't let him be the one

Tell him "no", oh-oh-oh
Tell him "no", oh-oh-oh
If he offers his ring, tell him no-oh-oh-oh
Tell him "no"

Did he tell you that he loved you?
And did you thrill to his charms?
And did you feel much more better
When he held you in his arms?

Tell him "no", oh-oh-oh
Tell him "no", oh-oh-oh
When he asks for a date, tell him no-oh-oh-oh
Tell him "no"

FADE
Tell him "no", oh-oh-oh
Tell him "no", oh-oh-oh
