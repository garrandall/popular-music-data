Hey you
The one with the laughing eyes
You, the one with the haunting stare
Well you
You have the power to hypnotize
I should'a known better
I should beware
'Cos I have followed you
Done everything for you
But you just won't look my way
So come on baby and
Save me
I'm running for cover
Save me
Is it one or the other babe
Save me
It's time for somebody else
Save me
Well, you, you could own the universe
Think about it and you'll realize
You, you got to believe me
And take my word
Look at me
It's written in my eyes
'Cos I have followed you
Done everything for you
But you just won't look my way
So come on baby and
Save me
I'm running for cover
Save me
Is it one or the other babe
Save me
I guess it's time for somebody else
Save me
I can't wait any longer
For paradise
I told you once
I'm not gonna tell you twice
So come on baby and
Save me
I'm running for cover
Save me
Is it one or the other babe
Save me
I guess it's time for somebody else
Save me
Save me
I'm running for cover
Save me
Is it one or the other
Save me
I guess it's time for somebody else
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
