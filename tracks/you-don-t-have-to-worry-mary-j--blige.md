Yea lets take em back
uh-huh

I need a real love Mary hollar at me if you need a real thug
we could ride through Compton to see real blood, real crypts,
and imma always hold you down thats real shit
I'm the Los Angeles King and you remind me of Mary the R&B Queen
I got the 411 whats crackin what I owe you for helping me go 4 times platinum
I had a kid to my life he's almost 2 i guess wat im tryin 2 say
is thank you for over ten years in the ghetto gospel
you paved the way for young black women of prosper
how you paint pictures
you deserve grammies and oscars
congratulation from me Aftermath and the "Dr"
so you could go ahead envy me
I'm Billboards top ten featuring 'MJB'


'91 i stepped in this game
After 'whats the 411' things aint been the same
and i cant complain but with all this fame comes a whole lot of pain
but im so glad to be here
and my music's still sincere
lets get back to the story
all of this pain and glory
and '94 was my life and my life wasn't right
so i reached out to you and told u what i been through


Hate it or love it,
(The underdogs on top)
(And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stops)
go 'head envy me
I'm the soul hip-hop queen
and i aint going nowhere
but you already know me
Hate it or love it,
(The underdogs on top)
(And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stops)
go 'head envy me
I'm the soul hip-hop queen
and i aint going nowhere
but you already know me


I came with 'share my world'
but at that point I was just a foolish girl
trying to find my way
Then I dropped the 'Mary' album
and people were saying that its just not gonna work
and my feelings they did hurt
but my fans showed me so much love
and i owe it all to them
and i came with 'No More Drama'
I remember that week
it was when Aaliyah died i couldnt hardly sleep
thought about it everyday and it made me change my way
I'm a real woman now because of all of these days




You remind me
of a real love
(you dont 'ave to worry)
real love
all night long
im goin down
dododododah dododododah
reminice on the love we have
you are everything love without a limit
what u gonna do without
my life, my life, my life,




Right now i just want to thank ..
Dr.Dre

Hate it or love it Aftermath's On Top!

and The Game for picking such a hot record
I thank y'all,


nah baby we thank u!
