Said you're gonna meet me
(Tonight's the night)
Tonight's the night
(Tonight's the night)
Said you're gonna kiss me
(Tonight's the night)
Tonight's the night
(Tonight's the night)
I don't know
Said I don't know right now
But I love you so
(Tonight's the night)
Said you're gonna make me
(Tonight's the night)
Turn the lights down low
(Tonight's the night)
Said you're gonna make me
(Tonight's the night)
Feel all aglow
(Tonight's the night)
I don't know
Said I don't know right now

I might love you so much
You may break my heart
I may want you so much
That all my dreams may fall apart
Said you're gonna hold me
(Tonight's the night)
Tonight's the night
(Tonight's the night)
Said you're gonna hold me
Hold me tight
I don't know
Said I don't know right now
But I love you so
(Tonight's the night)
Let's take a chance
(Tonight's the night)
Gonna be a great romance
(Tonight's the night)
Let's start right now...
