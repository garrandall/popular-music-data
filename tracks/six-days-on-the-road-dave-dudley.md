Well I pulled outta Pittsburgh a rollin' down that Eastern Sea board
I got my diesel wound up and she's a runnin' like a never before
There's a speed zone ahead alright well I don't see a cop in sight
Six days on the road and I'm a gonna make it home tonight
I got me ten forward gears and my George overdrive
I'm takin' little white pills and my eyes are open wide
I just passed a Jimmy in white been passin' everything in sight
Six days on the road I said I'm a gonna make it home tonight
Well it seems like a month since I kissed my baby goodbye
I could have a lotta women but I'm not like that sort of a guy
I could find one to hold me tight but I could never make believe it's alright
Six days on the road I said I'm a gonna make it home tonight

Well the ICC is a checkin' on down the line
Well I'm a little overweight and my log book's way behind
Cause there's nothin' bothers me tonight I can dodge all the scales alright
Six days on the road I said I'm a gonna make it home tonight
Well my rig's a little old but that don't mean she's slow
There's a flame from my stack and that smoke's blowin' black as coal
Oh well my hometown's a comin' in sight if you think I'm a happy you're right
Six days on the road I said I'm a gonna make it home tonight
Six days on the road I said I'm a gonna make it home tonight
Six days on the road I said I'm a gonna make it home tonight
