My Name Is Prancer
Duh, uh, I'm Dancer
My name is uh, my name is uh
Say are you Nervous
Nope

We are Santa's Reindeer
We've learned to sing this year
So we can tell everyone
Christmas day is near

Oh, we're on our way with
A great big sleigh full of toys
Choo choo trains and candy canes
For all you girls and boys

Jingle bells, oh, jingle bells
Ring your happy tune
Riding high up in the sky
Hi there, Mr. Moon

Gee, that was a lot of fun
Let's do it again

We are Santa's Reindeer
We've learned to sing this year
So we can tell everyone
Christmas day is near

Oh, we're on our way with
A great big sleigh full of toys
Choo choo trains and candy canes
For all you girls and boys

Jingle bells, oh, jingle bells
Ring your happy tune
Riding high up in the sky
Hi there, Mr. Moon

And remember, everybody
We're on our way to see you
And you and you and you...
