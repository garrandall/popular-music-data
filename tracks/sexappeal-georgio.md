Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex
For real
Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex
For real
Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex
Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex
I never met anybody with, such a sexy smile
The way you wear perfurme, just drives me wild
The way your bound to get in trouble with that pretty skin
And those big brown eyes always begging me
The way you drive me crazy, even weary on the phone
I can be a thousand miles away girl, but I still get turned on
Is it cause you're sexy body, just the way you talk
I think it's all of the above, and the way you walk

Sexappeal

It's kind of hard to make a friend, with the looks in style
Who seems so envious of you, 'cause your hair's so wild
They say we have to be related, 'cause the clothes we wear
I see the jeans are faded, I don't wear underware
Do you think I'm sexy, do you like my style
Tell me the truth baby, do I drive you wild
If I do, to you, got to let me know
'Cause I want you baby, got to let you know

Oh baby, do you like it?
Oh baby, do you like it?
Oh baby, do you like it?
Well if it feels that damn good let me hear you scream
