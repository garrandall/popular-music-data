Yeah, I'm King Shit
That's what I thought
When I was young
I knew everything
Till my know-it-all
Found out I didn't know too much

So I had a big piece of humble pie
I bought a ticket to a show
Found a new perspective
Some brand-new friends
And I found my first real home

We all put our pants on one leg at a time
Aw, the struggle's real
So here's the deal
Ain't no one gettin' out alive

So we dance all night (Dance all night)
A little pickin' too (A little pickin' too)
We take the weight of the world
And lift it right up off of you
(That's what we do)

Oh you got a broken heart
Just need to get away for a good time
I got good news
That's what me and the boys in the band
Were born to do, ah ooh

You can spend your whole life
However you see fit
Writing at a desk, diggin' in a ditch
Whose ass you gotta kiss?

So come on now, a-jump right in
'Cause life goes by so fast
How many summers do you have left
Before you're pushing up the grass?

Come and dance all night (Dance all night)
Do some pickin' too (A little pickin' too)
Take the weight of the world
And lift it right up off of you
It's just what we do

You got a broken heart
Just need to get away for a good time
I got good news
That's what me and the boys in the band
Were born to do

We all put our pants on one leg at a time
Aw, the struggle's real
So here's the deal
Ain't no one gettin' out alive

So we dance all night (Dance all night)
Do some pickin' too (A little pickin' too)
We take the weight of the world
And lift it right up off of you
It's just what we do

You got a broken heart
You just need to get away for a good time
I got good news
That's what me and the boys in the band
Were born to do

Come and dance all night (Dance all night)
Do some pickin' too (A little pickin' too)
Take the weight of the world
And lift it right up off of you
It's just what we do

You got a broken heart
And just need to get away for a good time
I got good news
That's what me and the boys in the band
Were born to do, ah-ooh
