wearing nothing is divine
naked is a state of mind
i take things off to clear my head
to say the things I haven't said
i live inside the elements
the earth and sky are my best friends
water is the evidence
that washes me from end to end


with my naked eye
i saw all the falling rain
coming down on me
with my naked eye
i saw all if I said it all
i could see

it's not a choice I tried to make
it's not a thought I couldn't take
something told me it was time
to give you yours and leave me mine
my vision started to be clear
i watched the sunlight coming near
i knew the day I knew the night
i knew I could regain my sight
and it feels alright



last night I came into your home
to break some ice and throw some stones
i asked if we could be alone
i had some troubles of my own
knew I had to say goodbye
to all the old things held inside
if I let the moment fly
i knew they'd all be magnified

and it feels alright

came around after dark
you are nothing but a lark
know I snuck in like a narc
i knew I had to leave my mark
wanted to be satisfied
i tried to be dignified
wearing nothing is divine
naked is a state of mind

and it feels alright



it feels alright
