Turn around
And you'll find
The girl you left behind
Turn around
And I'll be there

Would it be such a crime
To love me one more time?
Baby, I, but I don't care

I always thought that
When I found you
That I would always be around you

I guess it goes to show
How wrong a girl can be
When you said goodbye to me

I will go anywhere with you
Call my name
And I'll be there
Say the word
And I'll pack my bags tonight
I'll go anywhere
If you are there

No, I'm not the kind
To try to change your mind
If I thought that I were wrong

I know that I could
Make you happy
(And I know)
And I know that you could love me, too
(You could love me, too)

I know that I could find
A million reasons why
(Don't say goodbye)
Just don't say goodbye to me

I will go anywhere with you
Call my name
And I'll be there
Say the word
And I'll pack my bags tonight
I'll go anywhere
If you are there
Turn around

I know that I could
Make you happy
(And I know)
And I know that you could love me, too
(You could love me, too)

I know that I could find
A million reasons why
(Don't say goodbye)
Just don't say goodbye to me

I will go anywhere with you
Call my name
And I'll be there
Say the word
And I'll pack my bags tonight
I'll go anywhere
If you are there

I will go anywhere with you
Call my name
And I'll be there

I will go anywhere with you
Call my name
And I'll be there

I will go anywhere with you
Call my name
And I'll be there
