Go-go, go-go girl, you drive me wild
Shake it, shake it, shake it, child
Eyes wide open but you see no one

I'ma be there
When the music comes
Oh, shake it, baby

Go-go, go ahead
And work your show
Till you can't work no more
Go-go girl, you know
You're looking good

I see you wink your eye
Winking at every guy
Go-go girl, don't you realize

That I'm waiting for you
Whenever you get through
Oh, ooh, baby

Oh, you blow my mind, baby

Go-go, go-go girl, I like your style
Oh, shake it, mama
(Shake it, shake it, shake it, child)

You're not just working
But you're having fun
Oh, but guess what

I'ma be here
When the morning comes
I'ma be right here
Till the morning comes

Go-go, I see the
Beat is getting to you
You're feeling it
Through and through
Go-go girl, you know
You're knocking them out

I'm waiting here patiently
Till you can be alone with me
And that's the way it's gonna be

'Cause I'm waiting for you
Whenever you get through
Oh, ooh, baby

One, two, three
Baby, you're for me

Go-go, oh
You're looking good too, mama
Shake it, shake it, shake it, child

I'ma be right here
Till the morning comes
Ain't nobody getting up or down
