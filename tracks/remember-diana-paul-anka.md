Everybody remembers Diana
And just how much I loved her
I wrote a song about her
How wrong could I be?

Oh well, she went and found another
Found another lover
She didn't even bother
To say, goodbye to me

Things have changed
She's found another
Yes, things have changed
She's found another lover

Things have changed
She didn't say goodbye
Instead she made me cry
Diana

I'll learn to live without her
Yes, I'll forget about her
Just wait and see

Things will change, I'll find another lover
Things will change, I'll learn to live without her
Things will change, I'm gonna make her cry
I'm gonna say, goodbye to Diana

I'll learn to live without her
Yes, I'll forget about her
Just wait and see

Just wait and see
Just wait and see
