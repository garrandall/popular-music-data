Hit it, Hal

Early in the mornin', she hitched a ride down to Louisville
Holdin' onto a hundred dollar bill
Dressed herself like a Cajun Queen in New Orleans, baby
Yeah, she looked good, like a lady

Do it to me, James

And the Mississippi River runs like molasses in the summertime
And me, you know, I don't hardly mind

Sippin' on a beer in Bourbon Street and I'm sittin' easy
Don't get me wrong, it takes a lot to please me

Have a seat and take a load off your feet and she said, yes
So I said, I like your dress
Swamps all around make ya feel kinda funny, don't they, honey?
She crossed her legs and looked at me funny

Down on the bayou, why, you never know just what you're doin'?
Down on the bayou, why, you never know just what you're doin'?
Down on the bayou, why, you never know just what you're doin'?
Down on the bayou, why, you never know just what you're doin'?

Joseph

Early in the mornin', she hitched a ride down to Louisville
Holdin' onto a hundred dollar bill
Dressed herself like a Cajun Queen in New Orleans, baby
Yeah, she looked good, like a lady

And the Mississippi River, it runs like molasses in the summertime
And me, you know, I don't hardly mind

Sippin' on a beer in Bourbon Street and I'm sittin' easy
Don't get me wrong, it takes a lot to please me

Everybody sing

Down on the bayou, why, you never know just what you're doin'?
Down on the bayou, why, you never know just what you're doin'?

Have a seat and take a load off your feet and she said, yes
So I said, I like your dress
Swamps all around make ya feel kinda funny, don't they, honey?
She crossed her legs and looked at me funny

Down on the bayou, why, you never know just what you're doin'?
Down on the bayou, why, you never know just what you're doin'?
Down on the bayou, why, you never know just what you're doin'?
Down on the bayou, why, you never know just what you're doin'?
Down on the bayou, why, you never know just what you're doin'?
