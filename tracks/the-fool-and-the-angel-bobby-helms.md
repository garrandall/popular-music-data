(Here is the story of the fool and the angel)

The fool and the angel once fell in love
While heaven was watching from up above
The fool gave his love in a reckless way
For fools only live for today

The love to the angel was not the same
She couldn't believe it was just a game
She gave all the love in her heart and soul
For true love's an angel goal

How do I know these things I say
The answer is all too clear
I'm just the fool who walked away
When heaven was oh so near

Now the fool and the angel are far apart
The fool learned too late what was in his heart
But always there's spark of hope remain
The fool finds his angel again

But always there's spark of hope remain
The fool finds his angel again
