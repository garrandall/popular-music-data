Girl it's your body (it's your body, body, baby)
Oh, oh, girl it's your body (it's your body, body, girl)
I just can't seem to get enough, yeah
Enough of your lovin'
Girl it's your body (it's your body, body, baby)
Oh, it's your body
Girl it's your body (it's your body, body, girl)
Gir-ir-irl

Listen (tell them about it Johnny)
Don't think that I'm crazy
See you've been my lady
For so many years
And I think it's time that I let you know how I feel
You see I finally figured it out
Why I still can't seem to get enough of your love
Enough of our love, yeah, yeah

Every time I'm near you
My whole body can't keep still
Girl I'm on fire
Temperature's rising
Higher and higher
Girl I lose all self control
Every time, every time you're near
Every time you're near

Oh, I know that it's  your body
(Girl it's your body)
That keeps me yearning
(Girl, it's your body)
That keeps my body burning
(I just can't seem to get enough)
Can we make babies
(Enough of your love)
Can we make babies
(Enough of  your lovin')
Can we make a family

(Girl it's your body) (It's your body, body, baby)
Girl it's your body
(Girl it's your body) (It's your body, body, girl)
That keeps me yearning all night long
(Oh, oh, oh)
Yeah

Don't think I'm crazy
See you've been my lady
For so-o-o-o-o-o-o many years 
And I think it's time that I let you know that
That I finally figured it out (figured it out)
Why I still can't seem to get enough of your love

(Girl it's your body)
Girl it's your body, baby
(Girl it's your body)
So you know what I want you to do, I want you (it's your body)
(I just can't seem to get enough)
Step into my bedroom (enough of your love)
Take off all your clothes (enough of your lovin')
Lay down 
Let me rub your body down (girl it's your body)
Let me feel your body down (girl it's your body)
Let me squeeze your body (oh, oh)
Let me give you everything that you want
Eveything that you need

Now let me take my time (it's your body)
To express myself girl (it's your body)
Your body's so unusual
It makes me weak (weak)
But I'll be honest baby
I don't want nobody else
Nobody, nobody,nobody else
You're my computer love
You're my computer love

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Shoo-be-do-wop
I want your body, body baby
Shoo-be-do-wop
I want your body, body girl
I just can't seem to get enough
fade out
