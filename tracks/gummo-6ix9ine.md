Niggas iffy, uh, Blicky got the stiffy, uh
Got the blicky, uh, drum, it holds fifty, uh
Scum Gang

Pop these niggas like a wheelie nigga, you a silly nigga
In the hood with them billy niggas and them hoova niggas
You run up and they shootin' niggas, we ain't hoopin' nigga
No KB, you a loser nigga, up that uzi nigga
On the stoop, crills in my drawers, your girl on my phone
She wanna fuck but keep her clothes on, I only want the jaw
Man that's really all I use her for as I kick her out the door
I don't want her, you can keep the whore, she fiendin' for some more
In New York my niggas don't Milly Rock, my niggas money bop
Blow a case a nigga throwin' shots, I run 'em off they block
Quarter milli in the stash box, I grinded for my spot
Niggas talking 'bout that cash but my bag worth a lot
I don't fuck with no old hoes, only new hoes
Put my dick in her backbone, I pass her to my bro
I don't love her that's a sad ho, she a bad ho
I'ma fuck her then I dash home, to the cash ho

I'm on some rob a nigga shit, take a nigga bitch
Do the dash in the whip, count the cash in the whip
I pull up with a stick, I let that shit hit
Shout out... but I fucked that niggas bitch (Offset)


Diamonds hittin' (hittin')
When a boss talk bitch listen, huh (hey, hey)
We get yo biscuit, huh (biscuits)
I sic out my dog they vicious, huh (grr)
Fuck these bitches (huh)
Had to run out the bag in the kitchen (huh)
My nigga on stick shift (huh)
Get Earl off nigga on some real shit (huh)
Blow up the NAWF
It's all in the 
Let me see 
30 on my Glock
Plug em like a sock
Trap out the pot
Carbon grip the car
Trap whip the marks
My rock a mili
I take care a village
My bitch the realest
Wraith cost half a mili (wraith)
Hermes belt lizard
My bitch blooded like Clifford
Lambo speed shifting
Get shot in your back like Ricky (bah)
Glock 40 give you a hickey
Smoking on cook like a hippy
She smoke on the dope on a 
We haul it up first then we blitzing
RIP to Pistol
Get wacked off when I was with him
You got caught down back you a victim
Niggas ain't showing no sympathy
Better think twice before dissing me


Niggas iffy, uh, Blicky got the stiffy, uh
Got the blicky, uh, drum it holds fifty, uh
Move milli', all my niggas on fifty, uh
Talk down, pew pew pew, you silly, uh
Hit a stain, fifty bands, all hunnids
Spinning through ya block like a pop shove-it
Shoot at me I'm shooting back, I'm getting buckets
I ain't wanna take his life but nigga, fuck it

I'm on some rob a nigga shit, take a nigga bitch
Do the dash in the whip, count the cash in the whip
I pull up with a stick, I let that shit hit
Shout out... but I fucked that nigga bitch
I'm on some rob a nigga shit, take a nigga bitch
Do the dash in the whip, count the cash in the whip
I pull up with a stick, I let that shit hit
Shout out... but I fucked that nigga bitch

Scum Gang
