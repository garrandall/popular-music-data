Niggas iffy, uh, blicky got the stiffy, uh
Got the blicky, uh, drum, it hold fifty, uh
Scum Gang!


Pop these niggas like a wheelie, nigga, you a silly nigga
In the hood with them Billy niggas and them Hoover niggas
You run up and they shootin' niggas, we ain't hoopin', nigga
Yo, KB, you a loser, nigga, up that Uzi, nigga
On the stoop, crills in my drawers, your girl on my phone
She wanna fuck, but keep her clothes on, I only want the jaw
Man, that's really all I use her for, then kick her out the door
I don't want her, you can keep the whore, she fiendin' for some more
In New York, my niggas don't Milly Rock, my niggas money bop
Blow a case, a nigga throwin' shots, I run 'em off they block
Quarter milli' in the stash box, I grinded for my spot
Niggas talkin' 'bout that cash, but my bag worth a lot
I don't fuck with no old hoes, only new hoes
Put my dick in her backbone, I pass her to my bro
I don't love her, that's a sad ho, she a bad ho
I'ma fuck her, then I dash home, to the cash, ho


I'm on some rob a nigga shit, take the nigga bitch
Do the dash in the whip, count the cash in the whip
I pull up with a stick, I let that shit hit
Shout out *******, but I fucked that nigga bitch


Niggas iffy, uh, blicky got the stiffy, uh
Got the blicky, uh, drum it hold fifty, uh
Move milli', all my niggas on fifty, uh
Talk down (Pew pew pew), you silly, uh (Fah-fah-fah-fah)
Hit a stain, fifty bands, all hunnids
Spinnin' through ya block, like a pop shove-it
Shoot at me, I'm shootin' back, I'm gettin' buckets
I ain't wanna take his life, but nigga, fuck it


I'm on some rob a nigga shit, take the nigga bitch
Do the dash in the whip, count the cash in the whip
I pull up with a stick, I let that shit hit
Shout out *******, but I fucked that nigga bitch
I'm on some rob a nigga shit, take the nigga bitch
Do the dash in the whip, count the cash in the whip
I pull up with a stick, I let that shit hit
Shout out *******, but I fucked that nigga bitch


Scum Gang!
