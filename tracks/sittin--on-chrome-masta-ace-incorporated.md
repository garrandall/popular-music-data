Sittin on chrome (8X)

Chorus: *with sample from Eazy E*

He once was a dog from around the way... 
Eazy!
He once was a dog from around the way... 
Eazy!

I just got paid...
It's Friday night...
I'm sittin on chrome...
And I'm feelin alright...

Verse One:

Take it EZ, like E cuz I be
Lettin niggaz know what time it is when it comes to me
You can't find us here anywhere and I tear
You a new asshole, as beautiful as gold
Look at your reflection in my shine, find
Pissy hallways are always on my mind
But not tonight, I'm sittin on chri-dome
Makin more waves than my cellular phi-done
Mental energy from within keeps me higher
Than anything rolled and set on fire let me try a
Little somethin new, grand cuz what I am
Is mathematic, I must to blow your static if I can
I.N.C., Crew I thought you knew
That's how you do well check it this is how I do

Chorus

Verse Two:

I'm sittin on C-H, R-O-M-E
Sippin Brass Monkey, Digga got the Remi
Martin I'm startin to feel like I wanna
Hit the strip spot and I think that I'm gonna
I see my nigga Jose, "Mida, que pasa?"
We goin to the spot, need a ride? I gotcha
So come on in, come on in, come on in
It's like fire when you see my chrome spin
I paid the valet, I stepped to the stage
I think I wanna play with the girl in the cage
Lap dance, lap dance, lap dance
Baby look I got trouble in my pants
I just checked my wallet, no more dough
I just paid your rent and now I gotta go
She did me till I's done, smooth like Bally
I walked outside, they said that they ain't got no valet
Somebody caught me slippin, dipped with my ride
But we gonna catch they ass on the B-Side

Chorus

I just got paid...
It's Friday night...
I'm sittin on chrome...
And I'm feelin alright...

Verse Three:

You can't I-N-C me, the
Ace niguh, so be ghost like Amity-
-Ville horror, till tomorrow, you're done
So jet like Delta, I'm Fly like the Nun
My mental state's, more Great than the Lakes
I'm Superior, it's Erie how I breaks
Niggaz down, with the sound as I shine
One time, and the chrome is the mind
