Just, just, just, just
Let me make love to you, baby
I won't hurt, I won't hurt
I'll treat you ever so gentle
I'll make every little thing alright
Honey, you'll never forget this night
Just let me make love to you, baby
I'll be good, I'll be better then better
Neater than neater
Sweeter than sweeter
I promise I'll do anything
You want me to do
Everything a man in love would do


When the morning comes
Puts the night on the run
It's nonstop, baby
'Cause we've only, we've only
Begun to love, begun to love, baby, baby


Just let me make love to you, baby
I won't stop, I won't stop
'Til you ask me to
Tell me to, beg me to
Oh, baby, I'm counting on you, darling
To make this wish come true
I tell you, I'm counting on you
I'm counting on you
To make all my dreams and wishes


Just let me make love to you, baby
I won't stop, I won't stop
'Til you ask me to
Tell me to, beg me to
Oh, baby, I'm counting on you
To make this wish come true
Thank you for using
If you just let me
Make love to you, baby, love to you
I won't hurt, I won't hurt, baby, no
I'll treat you ever so gentle
