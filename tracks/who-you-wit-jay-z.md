Uh-huh, yeah hah
Never sprung huh?
Jigga, Roc-A-Fella y'all
Never sprung huh?
Yeah, peep the repertoire
Papas, feel me on this one
Papas, feel this
Never sprung huh? Know my style


I love bitches, thug bitches, shy bitches
Rough bitches, don't matter, you my bitches
Gold diggers witcha eyes on my riches
Can't knock your hustle for real, it's aight bitches
I'm game tight, see it all through the platinum French frames
With the French name, in the same night
Pull you and your tight friend
Lift your little dress like light wind, hah, then I slide right in
You know the whole repertoire, U.S. to the U-S-S-R
Sexin' in a Lexus car
Match wits with the best of y'all, the rest of y'all
Is like veg-etables in my presence, check it
Reminiscin' to nothin' you ever heard
Iceberg Slim baby, ride rims through the suburbs
Funds come in lump sums never ends deferred
Get money like I'm down South, Wednesday the third, it's on


More, dough to get, more shows to rip
I suggest you all roll with the click, who you wit?
Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick
More 0's than you know exist, bitch who you wit?


Can't scheme on 'em, Roc-A-Fella got a team on 'em
Chicks dream on him, trick cream on him
Lose it when dudes think it's just music
Lean on 'em, flash green on 'em and diamond rings on 'em
Sexin' around the way girls down to miras
I'm somethin' every girl gotta have like Levi's
Chiquita, mi amor, see how raw
You can love me or hate me, either or
I'ma stay winnin', rock the custom drop Bentleys
Never eat at Denny's and party like Lil' Penny
Can he live? Trick or main chick but if she leave
Just as quick, Indian give, ha-hah
Now what I look like? Givin' a chick half my trap
Like she wrote half my raps, yeah, I'm havin' that
You be the same chick when you leave me
The bankbook and the credit cards
And take everything you came with (it's on)


More, dough to get, more shows to rip
I suggest you all roll with the click, who you wit?
Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick
More 0's than you know exist, bitch who you wit?


You know the move's major, never minor
'Cause when you a true player, they never find ya
We takin' trips abroad with chicks from afar
Down in the grill in the villa, gettin' iller
Never know I'm at the resort, readin' to Robb Re-pes-ort
Checkin' out this new wine, inhalin' the cork
Million miles from the puddles, the rainy days, the tussles
Reign in ways to hustle, so we won't get caught
Had beef of all sort but I turned it around
Chose my steps more wisely, I'm learnin' the ground
I was so gung-ho when I earned my first pound
Now it's million dollar deals, (straight) turnin' 'em down
Roc-A-Fella make or break me, 'til death do us
Won't be in your right mind, you ever step to us
Been there, when I was in my tenth year, went there
Then I realized that it didn't make sense there
Backtrack, show me where the cash at
And plus, frivolous beef, please, we looking past that
Y'all can gossip while we learnin' the world
Drop the hot shit, never returnin' your girl, it's on


More, dough to get, more shows to rip
I suggest you all roll with the click, who you wit?
Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick
More 0's than you know exist, bitch who you wit?
More, dough to get, more shows to rip
I suggest you all roll with the click, who you wit?
Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick
More 0's than you know exist, bitch who you wit?
More, dough to get, more shows to rip
I suggest you all roll with the click, who you wit?
Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick
More 0's than you know exist, bitch who you wit?
More, dough to get, more shows to rip
I suggest you all roll with the click, who you wit?
Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick
More 0's than you know exist, bitch who you wit?


Fucka!
Jigga, nine-seven shit, next millennium
Recognize, realize, it's on
Roc-A-Blok y'all, ahh
Laughin, it's on
