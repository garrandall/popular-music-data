(CHORUS)
Call me and let me
Hear you call me
Let me be your loving man
You have to call my name
And call me
And let me hear your lips say
You're my sweet loving man
(CHORUS)
And call me
And let me feel your lips say
You're my sweet loving man
Whenever you want me
I'll be around to you
Whenever you need me
I'll be at your
Side to love you
Whenever you see me
Whenever you touch me
You know I'm in love

And all I want is you
So let me hear you
(CHORUS)
And call me
And let me feel your lips say
You're my sweet loving man
Whenever you want me
I'll be around to you
Whenever you need me
I'll be at your
Side to love you
Whenever you see me
Whenever you touch me
You know I'm in love
And all I want is you
La la la la...
You're my sweet loving man
La la la la...
You're my sweet loving man
