The buildings reach up to the sky
The traffic thunders on the busy street
The pavement slips beneath my feet
I walk alone and wonder
Who am I?

I close my eyes and I can fly
And I escape from all this worldly strife
Restricted by routine of life
But still I can't discover
Who am I

I long to wake up in the morning
And find everything has changed
And all the people that I meet don't wear a frown
But every day is just the same
I'm chasing rainbows in the rain
All the dreams that I believe in let me down

Maybe I'm reaching far too high
For I have something else entirely free
The love of someone close to me
Unfettered by the world that hurries by
Um, to question such good fortune
Who am I?

I long to wake up in the morning
And find everything has changed
And all the people that I meet don't wear a frown
But every day is just the same
I'm chasing rainbows in the rain
All the dreams that I believe in let me down

Maybe I'm reaching far too high
For I have something else entirely free
The love of someone close to me
Unfettered by the world that hurries by
To question such good fortune
Who am I?
