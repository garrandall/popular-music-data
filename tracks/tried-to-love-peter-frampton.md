What you want from me? 
Just got myself free 
Oh yeah 
Baby what you want from me? 
Only in a day 
To change over night? 
Oo I could see you 
Tried to love 
Tried to find the one 
You'll love forever 
You'd just a rich baby 

How'd you let him get away from you? 
I could be walkin' 
Years ago 
No one knew my name 
Watch out now 
How do I know? 
Nothin' but what I am 
This is the picture 
I don't know why 
I don't know why I bother 
But you tried to love 
I tried to find the one 
You'll love forever 

I don't know why you come 
By you're wastin' your time 
I don't know why you come 
By nothing left 
I can't see why you should lie 
I don't know why you come by 
I don't know why you come by 
I can't see why you should lie 
I don't know why you come by
