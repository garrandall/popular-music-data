Heeeeey! Yeah
(Do your thang, honey!)


I could feel it from the start
Couldn't stand to be apart
Somethin' 'bout you caught my eye
Somethin' moved me deep inside
I don't know what you did boy, but you had it
And I've been hooked ever since


Told my mother, my brother, my sister and my friends
Told the others, my lovers, both past and present tense
That every time I see you, everything starts making sense
(Do your thang, honey!)


Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do (what you do)
You're the kind of guy, a girl finds in a blue moon
You got soul, you got class, you got style, you're badass
Ain't no other man it's true (alright)
Ain't no other man but you


Never thought I'd be alright (no, no, no)
'Till you came and changed my life (yeah, yeah, yeah)
What was cloudy now is clear (yeah, yeah)
You're the light that I need here
You got what I want boy, and I want it
So keep on giving it up


So tell your mother, your brother, your sister and your friends
Tell the others, your lovers, better not be present tense
'Cause I want everyone to know that you are mine
And no one else's, woah, oh


Ain't no other man can stand up next to you (to you)
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do (what you do)
You're the kind of guy a girl finds in a blue moon
You got soul, you got class
You got style, you're badass (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ain't no other man it's true
Ain't no other man but you


Break it down now!
Ain't no other, ain't, ain't no other (other)
Ain't no other, ain't, ain't no other lover
Ain't no other, I, I, I need no other
Ain't no other man but you
You are there when I'm a mess
You talked me down from every ledge
Give me strength, boy, you're the best
You're the only one who's ever passed every test


Ain't no other man can stand up next to you (next to you)
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do
You're the kind of guy a girl finds in a blue moon
You got soul, you got class
You got style, you're badass (oh yeah)
Ain't no other man it's true
Ain't no other man but you
And now I'm telling you, so ain't no other man but you
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do (what you do)
You're the kind of guy a girl finds in a blue moon (baby, baby, no)
You got soul, you got class
You got style, you're badass (don't you know?)
Ain't no other man it's true
Ain't no other man but you
