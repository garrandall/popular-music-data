You know love makes a fool of you
You do anything that it wants you to
Love can make-a you feel so good
When it goes like you think it should
Or it can make you cry at night
When your baby don't treat you right
When you're feelin' sad and blue
You know love's made a fool of you
You know love's made a fool of you

You know love makes a fool of men
But you don't care, you're gonna try it again
Times goes by, it's a-passing fast
You think your love-a has come at last
By and by you're gonna find
Crazy love-a has-a made you blind
When you're feelin' sad and blue
You know love's made a fool of you
You know love's made a fool of you

Love can make-a you feel so good
When it goes like you think it should
Or it can make you cry at night
When your baby don't treat you right
When you're feelin' sad and blue
You know love's made a fool of you
You know love's made a fool of you
