Your__ are fat
I'm bout eat you up girl
The wait has been long enough
And I'm ready (been ready) to freak the funk
Where the gravy-lick that biscuit
Let me get some hottie on toast with a pound of butter
No soda, no juice, no water or nothing junk man__ till
I pass the hell out
I want some slobber hanging out the side of your mouth
I want some honey flow to the bed to the couch
I wants some to the front to the back of the house
No phone, no 2-way, nobody tracking us down
Baby mama, your baby daddy
Petey back in the house
Let me rub you down in hot oil and cocoa butter
Let's play hide and go seek and he can't stop
Cause this year past you need to take this thing to the rubber
Hey Joe bring that hook back and let me slip on this rubber

(This is the remix)
Girl it's been a while for us
We gotta lot of making up
Let's get into some sexy stuff
Ain't no need for us to rush
(This is, This is the remix)
Girl I got an appetite
And I'm about to take a bite
So baby let's dim the lights
Daddy's staying home tonight

Tell your girlfriends
Don't be coming round like if we be on the bed rocking
All night
Girl I'll have you in and out of here
Seen it like a __
Girl I wanna show you love
Romance you till you get enough
Oh baby now let's stay home tonight
Can't you see that - that I need you baby

Girl here is where I wanna stay
No friends, no phone, no 2-way
Oh let's stay home tonight
Don't you know that I need you

Ooh Ooh settle me baby
It's about to get crazy
Gonna be ridin' tonight
Cause you got a sexy way
So girl put on a show for J
And you know how I like to play
When we play
Ooh no pager, no phone
Don't knock on my door
Leave us alone
Nobody's home
Ooh
No car, no keys
I can't go
She can't leave
Please baby
(Let's stay home tonight)

Girl I got the remedy don't you see 
That we got to keep this thing so tight
So tonight all of my__ don't that sound all right
