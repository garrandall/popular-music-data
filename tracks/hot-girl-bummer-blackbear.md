Fuck you and you, and you
I hate your friends and they hate me too
I'm through, I'm through, I'm through
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum

This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum
This that throw up in your Birkin bag
Hook up with someone random
This that social awkward suicide
That buy your lips and buy your likes
I swear she had a man, but shit
Hit different when it's Thursday night

That college dropout music every day
Leg day she be too thick
And my friends are all annoying
But we go dumb, yeah, we go stupid
This that 10K on the table
Just so we can be secluded
And the vodka came diluted
One more line, I'm superhuman

Fuck you and you, and you
I hate your friends and they hate me too
I'm through, I'm through, I'm through
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum

Fuck you and you, and you
I hate your friends and they hate me too
Fuck you and you, and you
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum

This that hot girl bummer 2-step
They can't box me in, I'm too left
This that drip that's more like oceans
They can't fit me in a Trojan
Out of pocket, but I'm always in my bag
Yeah, that's the slogan
This that, "Who's all there? I'm pullin' up
With a emo chick that's broken"

This that college dropout music every day
Leg day she be too thick
And my friends are all annoying
But we go dumb, yeah, we go stupid
This that 10K on the table
Just so we can be secluded
And the vodka came diluted
One more line, I'm superhuman

Fuck you and you, and you
I hate your friends and they hate me too
I'm through, I'm through, I'm through
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum

Fuck you and you, and you
I hate your friends and they hate me too
Fuck you and you, and you
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum

This that college dropout music every day
Leg day she be too thick
And my friends are all annoying
But we go dumb, yeah, we go stupid
This that college dropout music every day
Leg day she be too thick
And my friends are all annoying
But we go dumb, yeah, we go stupid
We go stupid, we go stupid
We go (And you want me to change? Fuck you!)

Fuck you and you, and you
I hate your friends and they hate me too
I'm through, I'm through, I'm through
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum

Fuck you and you, and you
I hate your friends and they hate me too
Fuck you and you, and you
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum
