Stuck in a maze, oh oh oh oh

Stuck in a maze, mmm

Stuck in a maze
Everything's okay
But it's not really okay
My life's a death race
I'm numbing my pain with codeine rain
I'm goin' insane, life's not the same 

Stuck in a maze
And I'm not goin' anywhere
My brain is going everywhere
I'm tormented every day
I'm, I'm losin' my mental
Sorrows that I been through
Story to be continued

I sip ill, pop pills, crack seals
Doin' anything to numb the way that I feel 
Yeah, chase thrills
Used to crashin', Hot Wheels 
Ride a dirt-bike down a ditch, see if I live

I'm not my subconscious, I'm conscious 
They tell me that they can help me, I got this
Watch this
I took my demons into the bank of life 
And I made the biggest deposit 
Without drugs I'm losin' my logic 
These pills are my Pro Tools, still got Logic
I run, I run, I run
I run, I run, I run

Stuck in a maze
Everything's okay
But it's not really okay
My life's a death race
I'm numbing my pain with codeine rain
I'm goin' insane, life's not the same

Stuck in a maze
No, I'm not goin' in 
My brain is going everywhere
I'm tormented every day
I'm, I'm losin' my mental
Sorrows that I been through
Story to be continued
