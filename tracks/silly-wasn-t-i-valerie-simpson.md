I believed in you
Thought what you said was true
It didn't occcur to me
It was a lie,
Ha ha ha, sily wasn't I, oh...

I was lost in a world
And like a foolish girl
I really thought
You were my guy (unh)
Ha ha ha, silly wasn't I, oh...

I remember the time
You called me on the phone
Said you'd had a busy day
You'd hurry home
I waited, I waited
Time went by,

I tried to laugh
But all i could do was cry
Silly, silly wasn't I,

Oh wasn't I silly
To think I'd found the love
I was dreamin of
I never thought
You would say goodbye
Ha ha ha, silly .oh

Wasn't I silly
To think that you loved me
Oh wasn't I silly ha ha ha
Silly
Fade off to end
