Louisiana Man

Doug Kershaw

At birth mom and papa called their little boy Ned
Raised him on the banks of a river bed
A houseboat tied to a big tall tree
A home for my papa and my mama and me
The clock strikes three and papa jumps to his feet
Already mama's cooking papa something to eat
At half past papa he's ready to go
He jumps in his pirogue headed down the bayou

He's got fishing lines strung across the Louisiana rivers
Gotta catch a big fish for us to eat
Setting traps in the swamp catching anything he can
Trying to make a living, he's a Louisiana Man
Trying to make a living, he's a Louisiana Man
Muskrat hides hanging by the dozens
Even got a lady make a muskrat cousin
Got 'em out drying in the hot, hot sun
Papa's gonna turn Ben to bun

Well they call mama Rita and my daddy Jack
Little baby brother on the floor that's Mack
Bren(da) and Lin(da) are the family twins
And big brother Ed's on the bayou fishing
On the river floats papa's great big boat
That's how my papa goes into town
It takes every bit of a night and a day
To even reach a place where people stay

I can hardly wait until tomorrow comes around
That's the day my papa takes his furs to town
Papa promised me that I could go
He'd even let me see a cowboy show

I seen the cowboys and Indians for the first time then
I told my papa gotta come again
Papa said son we got lines to run
Come back again when work is all done

He's got fishing lines strung across the Louisiana rivers
Gotta catch a big fish for us to eat
He's setting traps in the swamp catching anything he can
Trying to make a living, he's a Louisiana Man
Trying to make a living, he's a Louisiana Man
