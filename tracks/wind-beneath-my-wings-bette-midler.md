It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine
You always walked a step behind

I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
Only a face without a name
I never once heard you complain

Did you ever know that you're my hero
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings

It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know I know the truth, yes I do
I would be nothing without you

Did you ever know that you're my hero
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
'Cause you are the wind beneath my

Did you ever know that you're my hero
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings

Did you ever know that you're my hero
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings

'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings
'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings
'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings
