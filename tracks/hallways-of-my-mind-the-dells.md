Thoughts of you stand sacredly
In the hallways of my mind

Look what you did to me, my darling
Cut me to the bone
At the height of loving you
You left me all alone

Still, you're a part of everything I do
And day after day, I find
Thoughts of you stand sacredly
In the hallways of my mind

Hey, hey, hey, oh, yeah
Yeah, hey, oh, yeah...

Oh, so you're gone
And memories live on
In my mind, it's so real
Gentle things, living things
That I will always feel

I pray that you'll see
What you've done to me
And what you've left behind
Thoughts of you stand sacredly
In the hallways of my mind

Hey, hey, hey, oh, yeah
Yeah, hey, oh, yeah...

Baby, baby, baby (baby, baby)
What am I gonna do
(What will I ever do)
Night after night
I'm lonely (lonely)
Thinking of you (you, you)

Aching in my brain
(Aching in my brain)
It's an excruciating pain
(Pain, pain, pain)
I guess I'll never be the same
How can I ever explain

So you're gone
And memories live on
In my mind, it's so real
Gentle things, living things
That I will always feel

I pray you'll see
What you've done to me
And what you've left behind
Thoughts of you
They stick with me

In the hallways (hallways)
(In the hallways) in the
Hallways of my mind...
