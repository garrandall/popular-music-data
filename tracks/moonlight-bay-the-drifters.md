We were sailin' along
On Moonlight Bay
We could hear the voices ringing
They seemed to say

You have stolen my heart
Now don't go away
As we sang love's old sweet song
On Moonlight Bay

We were sailin' along
On Moonlight Bay
We could hear the voices ringing
They seemed to say

You have stolen my heart
Now don't go away
As we sang love's old sweet song
On Moonlight Bay

We were sailin' along
On Moonlight Bay
We could hear the voices ringing
They seemed to say

You have stolen my heart
Now don't go away
As we sang love's old sweet song
On Moonlight Bay
On Moonlight Bay
