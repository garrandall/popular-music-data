Well, baby used to stay out all night long
She made me cry, she did me wrong
She had my nose open, that's no lie
Tables turn, and now it's her turn to cry


Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now


Well, she used to run around with every man in town
She spent all my money, tryin' to play the high-class game
When she put me out, it was a pity how I cried
But the tables turn, and now it's her turn to cry


Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now


Well, I used to wake up in the morning and get my breakfast in bed
Whenever I got worried she would rub my aching head
But now she's here and there, with every man in town
She's still trying to take me for that same old clown


Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
