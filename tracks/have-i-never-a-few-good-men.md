Have I never told you I love you
Have I never told you I care
Have I never told you how much I need you
Have I ever, ever not bein' there

If I never told you a care
Girl, I swear to you it's not because the feeling's not there
I'll promise to you from the top of my soul
The bottom of my heart, girl, don't you know
I love you then, I love you now and will forever more

Have I never (Oh) told you I love you (Told)
Have I never told you the words
Baby, I love you, you know I love you
Just know that I love you

Have I ever told you I miss you
Have I ever hurt your heart
Girl, I never ever meant to mistreat you
I could never knowingly break your heart

If I ever called you to feel
The words I speak straight from my heart are not very real
I promise to you from the tip of my heart
To the depths of my soul I pray that you know
I love you now, I love you then and will forever more

Have I never (Oh, ho) told you I love you
Have I never (Have I never, never) told you the words
Baby, I love you (Baby, I, you know I), you know I love you
Just know that I love you (Yeah)

Oh, baby (Baby), baby
You will always (Be my) be my lady
And I promise (Promise) I will never (Mmm) break your heart (Heart)
Â€˜Cause I love you (I love you), I need you (I need you) and will forever

Have I never told you I love you (Oh, baby)
Have I never (I never, no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no, baby) told you the words
(I know that I love you, baby)
Baby, I love you (I want you to know that I love you, baby), you know I love you
Just know that I love you
(I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, love you, love you, I do)

Have I never (I never) told you I love you (I never, never, never, never)
Have I never (Oh...oh, oh) told you the words (Baby, I)
Baby, I love you (You should know), you know I love you
Just know that I love you

No, no, no, no, baby
I love you
Oh, baby, just know that I love you
