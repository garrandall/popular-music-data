Using our private life
We plan for the quiet night
'Round whispers and lover's sighs

And it was so personal
It sounded so personal

And when we're face to face
Let not a moment waste
I feel like it's lover's fate

'Cause it's so personal
Sincerely personal

Seems like the stronger falls
Stronger than you and me
We'll let it take its course
Building intensity

Inside love
Just the two of us in our love
(Living in that love)
Inside love
I can't help but feel it's forever love

Inside love
Just the two of us in our love
(Living in that love)
Inside love
You know it's in our hearts

Of topics that we discuss
My favorite is always lust
We're building an inside love

Making it personal
And keeping it personal

Honey, I sure would like
For us to take the night
And hide from those prying eyes

Making it personal
Sincerely personal

Seems like the stronger falls
Stronger than you and me
We'll let it take its course
Building intensity

Inside love
Just the two of us in our love
(Living in that love)
Inside love, ooh, baby
I can't help but feel it's forever love

Inside love
Just the two of us in our love
(Living in that love)
Inside love
It's in our hearts

We'll let it take its course
Building intensity

Inside love
Just the two of us in our love
(Living in that love)
Inside love
I can't help believe it's forever love

(Inside love)
Inside love
(Living in that love)
Inside love
You know it's in our hearts

(Inside love)
Inside love
Inside love
(Living in that love)
Inside love
