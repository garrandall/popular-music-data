This old highway seems so lonesome when you're goin' where you've been
And a lonesome song can make you cry time and time again
If I had listened to a friend of mine ten years ago today
I'd have a better job than what I've got today


But the billboards on the highways and the brake lights on the cars
Make me jump out on the highway with my bag and my guitar
If she comes or if she goes it doesn't matter anymore
'Cause I'm ridin' my thumb to Mexico


Ridin' my thumb to Mexico
It don't matter when or how I go
I'll ride this thumb 'til I see her again
So I'm ridin' my thumb to Mexico


Well the reason why she left me's not the reason that I'm here
I'm a traveling kind of man just need a change of atmosphere
If there's any place I haven't been at all that's where I'll go
So I'm ridin' my thumb to Mexico


Ridin' my thumb to Mexico
It don't matter when or how I go
I'll ride this thumb 'til I see her again
So I'm ridin' my thumb to Mexico
