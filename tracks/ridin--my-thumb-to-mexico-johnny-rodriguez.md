This old highway seems so lonesome
When you're going where you've been
And a lonesome song can make you cry
Time and time again
By listenin' to a friend of mine
Ten years ago today
I'd have a better job than what I've got today

But the billboards on the highway
And the brake lights on the cars
Make me jump out on the highway
With my bag and my guitar
If she comes or if she goes
It doesn't matter anymore
I'm ridin' my thumb to Mexico

Ridin' my thumb to Mexico
It don't matter when or how I go
I'll ride this thumb 'til I see her again
Oh I'm ridin' my thumb to Mexico

Well, the reason why she left me
Is not the reason that I'm here
I'm a travelin' kind of man
Just need a change of atmosphere
If there's any place I haven't been
At all that's where I'll go
I'm ridin' my thumb to Mexico

Ridin' my thumb to Mexico
It don't matter when or how I go
I'll ride this thumb 'til I see her again
Oh I'm ridin' my thumb to Mexico

Oh I'm ridin' my thumb to Mexico
It don't matter when or how I go
I'll ride this thumb 'til I see her again
Oh I'm ridin' my thumb to Mexico
I'll ride this thumb 'til I see her again
I'm ridin' my thumb to Mexico
