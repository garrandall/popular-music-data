She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatin
Dynamite with a laser beam

She keeps MoÃ«t & Chandon
In her pretty cabinet
"Let them eat cake", she says
Just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy
For Khrushchev and Kennedy (Ohoh
At anytime an invitation
You can't decline (Oh oh

Caviar and cigarettes
Well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatin
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind (Bah, bah, bah, bah)
Anytime

Oh recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness

Met a man from China (Oh oh
Went down to Geisha Minah (Killer, killer)
Then again incidentally (She's a Killer Queen)
If you're that way inclined

Perfume came naturally from Paris (Naturally)
For cars she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatin
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind (Bah, bah, bah, bah)
Anytime

Drop of a hat she's as willing as
Playful as a pussy cat (Oh oh
Then momentarily out of action (Oh oh
Temporarily out of gas (Dah, dah)
To absolutely drive you wild, wild
She's all out to get you

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatin
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind (Bah, bah, bah, bah)
Anytime

Oh recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?
You wanna try
