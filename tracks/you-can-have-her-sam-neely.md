You know the other day, I had a friend of mine come up to me,
He said, Sam, I've got a problem with my old lady.
I said, man, you've got to be kiddin' me,
She's one of the finest looking women I've ever seen,
That's when he smiled and said,


Well you can have her, I don't want her, she didn't love me, anyway.
She only wanted, someone to play with,
But all I wanted, was a love to stay.

The girl I loved, she up and left me,
She ran away with, my best friend.
Comes home at night, for just one hour,
When daylight comes, she's gone again.



When you're stuck with, the wrong woman,
There ain't nothing, that you can do.
Just dig a hole, and crawl right in it,
And pull the ground right in, over you.



Life without love is, mighty empty,
But the, confession is, good for the soul.
I'd rather have love, for just one hour,
Than have the world, and all it's gold.
