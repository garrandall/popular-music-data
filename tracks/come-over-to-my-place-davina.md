Heyyyy... hu hu. hou... hou...
Baby...
I would like to know you better ...hu
Come on...
Tell me when can we get together... ho
To be all alone... hoooo

Refrain: Come over to my place
Relax and chill
Do what you feel (do what you feel baby)
Come over to my place
Have no fear
What you want is right here

Feels so right

Huuu My love is ready so come on, ohhh yeah
