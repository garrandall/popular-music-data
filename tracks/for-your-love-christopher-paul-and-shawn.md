For your love I would do anything
I would do anything for your love
For your kiss I would go anywhere
I would go anywhere for your kiss

How foolish I grow with each heart beat
But we are the foolish and that's why
I repeat

For your love I would do anything
I would do anything for your love
For your kiss I would go anywhere
I would go anywhere for your kiss

For your love. For your love
For your love. For your love
