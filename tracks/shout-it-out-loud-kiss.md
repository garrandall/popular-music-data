Well, the night's begun, and you want some fun
Do you think you're gonna find it (Think you're gonna find it)
You got to treat yourself like number one
Do you need to be reminded (Need to be reminded)


It doesn't matter what you do or say
Just forget the things that you've been told
We can't do it any other way
Everybody's got to rock and roll, whoa, whoa


Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud
Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud


If you don't feel good, there's a way you could
Don't sit there broken-hearted (Sit there broken-hearted)
Call all your friends in the neighborhood
And get the party started (Get the party started)


Don't let 'em tell you that there's too much noise
They're too old to really understand
You'll still get rowdy with the girls and boys
'Cause it's time for you to take a stand, yeah, yeah
(Yeah)


Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud
Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud


Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud
You've got to have a party
Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud
Turn it up louder
Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud
And everybody, shout it now
Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud
Oh yeah
Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud
I hear it getting louder
Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud
And everybody, shout it now
Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud
Whoo!
