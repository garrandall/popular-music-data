I'm ridin' in your car
Ya turn on the radio
You're pullin' me close
I just say no
I say I don't like it
Butcha know I'm a liar
'Cuz when we kiss
Oh
Fire
Mmm, fire

Late at night
Oh, you're takin' me home
You say you wanna stay (I wanna stay)
I say I wanna be alone
I say I don't love you
Butcha know I'm a liar
'Cuz when we kiss
Oh
Fire
Fire

You had a hold on me right from the start
A grip so tight I couldn't tear it apart
My nerves all jumpin', actin' like a fool
Your kisses they burn
But my heart stays cool

Well, Romeo and Juliet
Samson and Delilah
Oh baby you can bet
A love they couldn't deny
My words they say split (Yeah)
But my words they lie (They lie)
'Cuz when we kiss
Oh
Fire
Uh oh, Fire

You had a hold on me right from the start
A grip so tight I couldn't tear it apart
My nerves all jumpin', actin' like a fool
Your kisses they burn
But my heart stays cool
Fire

Our kisses like fire
Woah oh oh, fire
Love whatcha doin' now
Fire
Touchin' me with fire
Touchin' me, burnin' me
Take me home
Fire
Woah oh oh, fire
