I couldn't sleep last night just walked the floor don't know how I stand this anymore
Lonely are the times since I lost you received your invitation to the blues
I don't know why you caused me such pain
I just hope I'll never go through this much again
Thanks for sending something I can't use received your invitation to the blues

You took the laughter from this world of mine thanks to you the sun will never shine
Walk the floor so much wore out my shoes received your invitation to the blues
I don't know why...I don't know why you caused me such pain
I just hope I'll never go through this much again
Lonely me I don't know what to do received your invitation to the blues
