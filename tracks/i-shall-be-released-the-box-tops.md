They say everything can be replaced
This every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here

I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

They say every man needs protection
They say every man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above this wall

I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

Standing next to me in this lonely crowd
Is a man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him shout so loud
Crying out that he was framed

I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
