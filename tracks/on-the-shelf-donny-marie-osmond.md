You took my love and you threw it away
Gave you my heart and you took it that day
Took took took took it away
Took took took took it away
And I want it back

Went for a drive just the other day
I left my heart and you towed it away
T t t towed it away
T t t towed it away
And I want it back

I'm like a dog without a bone
I'm like a house that's not a home
I'm like a watch that nobody wants to wind

I'm like a lock without a key
Nobody wants to lean on me
I'm so lonely, lonely without you
Back on the shelf am I, baby
Back on the shelf am I

Went to a party cause you said you would go
I sat around but you didn't show
No no no, you didn't show
No no no, you didn't show, no, no
No, no

I ring your house, I don't get no reply
Well I don't know, I think you're telling me lies
T t t telling me lies
T t t telling me lies oh oh

I'm like a dog without a bone
I'm like a house that's not a home
I'm like a watch that nobody wants to wind

I'm like a lock without a key
Nobody wants to lean on me
I'm so lonely, lonely without you
Back on the shelf am I, baby
Back on the shelf am I, baby
Back on the shelf am I, baby
Back on the shelf am I, baby
Back on the shelf
