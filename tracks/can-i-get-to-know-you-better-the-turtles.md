Everybody says "Be strong" but I just can't take it
Every time I look at you, I feel funny inside, yeah
I've been meaning to ask you this for such a long, long time

Can I get to know you better?
Got to get to know you better
Can I get to know you better tonight?

I know that you think of me as just a friend
But you don't know how friendly I can be, yeah
I want so much to prove my love, baby, give me half a chance

Can I get to know you better?
Got to get to know you better
Can I get to know you better tonight?

Now I don't think I can go another day without you
And one little kiss will tell me what I wanna know 'bout you
It ain't gonna hurt you, come on, baby

Can I get to know you better?
Got to get to know you better
Can I get to know you better tonight?

Can I get to know you better?
Got to get to know you better
Can I get to know you better tonight?
