Whoot Whoot Whoot Whoooo
Whoot Whoot Whoot Whoooo

I ain't never been no Silly Ho
Waiting for your call
Like the other girls want you
I ain't never been no one to mess
With someone else's mess
That's not a thing for me to do
I ain't never been that chickenhead
To wake up in your bed
After every club or two
I no be the one in mini skirt
Always wanna flirt
With every player on the team

If you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
If you really wanna know
Boy you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do
If you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
If you really wanna know
Boy you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do
Oh oh

I ain't never been no silly bitch
Waiting to get rich
From a nigga's bank account
I have always had my own things
Bought my own rings
Not goin' let you catch me out
You should take a lesson from me

I ain't the one to be
Depending on someone else
I can run a scam before he can
I'm better than a man
I always keep my game on deck

If you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
If you really wanna know
Boy you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do
If you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
If you really wanna know
Boy you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do
Oh oh

If you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
If you really wanna know
Boy you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do
If you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
If you really wanna know
Boy you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do
Oh oh

You know you can't get with this
One night you just
Go and bust find a ho
To give it up
Why you even try your luck
Stuck on silly shit
Boy you know you need to quit
Ain't the one for all this
You missed out

I'm I'm I'm out
I'm out I'm out out out
I'm I'm I'm out out
I'm I'm out
I'm out out out

If you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
If you really wanna know
Boy you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do
If you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
If you really wanna know
Boy you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do
Oh oh

If you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
If you really wanna know
Boy you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do
If you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
If you really wanna know
Boy you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do
Oh oh

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh yeah
