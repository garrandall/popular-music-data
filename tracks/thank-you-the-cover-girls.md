Oh... oh... oh... oh... oh...


I was young
When I met you
You were my first love
Love was new, oh, whoa

But then you went away
And broke my little heart
I learned to live with pain
While we were apart

Time
Brought us back together again
We became lovers
We became friends


I just wanna thank you
For the love you gave
I just wanna thank you
For the love we made

I just wanna thank you
Just thank you
'Cause even though we're not together
You know that I'll love you forevermore
(Forevermore)


I look back
On those days
We've gone our
Separate ways

Oh, oh, oh
I still think thoughts of you
A love that we once shared
Will always shine through

Time
Taught us how to let our grow
How it all happened
I still don't know



Whoa... oh... oh


Time
Brought us back together again
We became lovers
We became friends


I just wanna thank you
For the love you gave
I just wanna thank you
For the love we made

I just wanna thank you
Just thank you
Thanks a million, boy
Oh... oh... oh... oh

I just wanna thank you
For the love you gave
I just wanna thank you
For the love we made
(Oh... oh... oh... oh...)

Thank you
Just thank you
Thank you, boy
Oh... oh... oh... oh... oh

I just wanna thank you
For the love you gave
I just wanna thank you
For the love we made
(Oh... oh...)

I just wanna thank you
Just thank you
'Cause even though we're not together
You know that I'll love you forevermore, whoa
