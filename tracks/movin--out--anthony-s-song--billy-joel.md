Anthony works in the grocery store
Savin' his pennies for someday
Mama Leone left a note on the door
She said "Sonny, move out to the country"
Workin' too hard can give you a heart attack-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack
You oughta know by now (you oughta know by now)
Who needs a house out in Hackensack
Is that all you get for your money


And it seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama, if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out
I'm movin' out


Sergeant O'Leary is walkin' the beat
At night he becomes a bartender
He works at Mr. Cacciatore's down on Sullivan Street
Across from the medical center
Yeah, and he's tradin' in his Chevy for a Cadillac-ac-ac-ac-ac-ac
You oughta know by now (you oughta know by now)
And if he can't drive with a broken back
At least he can polish the fenders


And it seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama, if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out
I'm movin' out


You should never argue with a crazy mind
You oughta know by now (you oughta know by now)
You can pay Uncle Sam with the overtime
Is that all you get for your money


And if that's what you have in mind
Yeah, if that's what you're all about
Good luck movin' up, cause I'm movin' out
I'm movin' out
