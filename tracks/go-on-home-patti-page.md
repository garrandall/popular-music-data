I found you today
While I was reading Patti Smith
And she mentioned your name
So I drove to the store
And I bought a copy of
The Wind-Up Bird and let it rain
Town like Japan, sipping sencha
On the train to Kyoto on Saturday
Wondering through the Fushimi gates

Murakami, you paint real life
On a snow white empty page
Like origami, you fold your light
In a brand new ancient away
And I know your pen is mightier
Than a Samurai's sword
It's diamond sharpened
Murakami, your words inspire
From an island far away
You sound like a symphony, yeah
You sound like a symphony, yeah

I chased that sheep
All the way out to Hokkaido
I couldn't find a thing
Anywhere, and I felt so alone
That I traveled back to Tokyo
To walk those neon streets
Weaving like 
That you drew in silence
While your 
And Bernstein vinyl played
Listening to every mark they made

Murakami, you paint real life
On a snow white empty page
Like origami, you fold your light
In a brand new ancient way
And I know your pen is mightier
Than a Samurai's sword
It's diamond sharpened
Murakami, your words inspire
From an island far away
You sound like a symphony, yeah
You sound like a symphony, yeah

And I wonder what would men do without women
Would we live in caves and go for days
Without a shave just watching television
All alone, staring at the phone just wishing
Someone else was home

Murakami, you paint real life
On a snow white empty page
Like origami, you fold your light
In a brand new ancient way
And I know your pen is mightier
Than a Samurai's sword
It's diamond sharpened
Murakami, your words inspire
From an island far away
You sound like a symphony, yeah
You sound like a symphony, yeah
You sound like a symphony, yeah
You sound like a symphony, yeah
