You're watching your watch
And I know what's on your mind
There's someone home waiting
And you're way over time
What could be so right
Is as wrong as can be
Go on home, you don't belong here with me

I love you, I love you, I love only you
But the one home who's waiting
She loves you, too
She's watching and she's wonderin'
Oh where can you be
Go on home, you don't belong here with me

Go on home, you don't belong here with me
Though I want you and I need you desperately
To hide here in the darkness
Is as wrong as can be
Go on home, you don't belong here with me
Go on home, you don't belong here with me
