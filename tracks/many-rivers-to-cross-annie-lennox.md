Many many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering I am lost
As I travel along the white cliffs of Dover
Many rivers to cross
And it's only my will that keeps me alive
I've been licked, washed up for years
And I merely survive because of my pride
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be on your own
Lovers left me and I don't know the reason why
Well, I guess I'll have to cry
Many rivers to cross
But just where to begin, I'm playing for time
There been times when I find myself
Thinking of committing some dreadful crime
Won't you tell me now?
Many rivers, many rivers
Many rivers, many rivers, oh many rivers
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, ooh, many rivers
