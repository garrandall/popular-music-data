Tell it all brother, before we fall
Tell it all brothers and sisters
Tell it all

How much you're holding back on me
When you say you're giving all?
And in the dungeons of your mind
Who you got chained to the wall?

Tell it all brother, before we fall
Tell it all brothers and sisters
Tell it all

Did you plant your feet on higher ground
To avoid life's mud and stone?
Did you ever kick a good man
When he was down, just to make yourself feel strong?

Oh, tell it all brother, before we fall
Tell it all brothers and sisters
Tell it all

Tomorrow just might be too late
Now is the time
To get your jumbled mind straight
And seek a new design

Did you ever walk for a crippled man
Pretending you were lame?
And what made you think one feeble hand to God
Was gonna make Him call your name?

Tell it all brother, before we fall
Tell it all brothers and sisters
Tell

Tell it all brother, before we fall
Tell it all brothers and sisters
Tell

Tell it all brother, before we fall
Tell it all brothers and sisters
Tell

Tell it all brother, before we fall
Tell it all
