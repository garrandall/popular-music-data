Can't think of no one else I would rather be with
Each day you give me a reason to live
Loving you's a natural thing baby
Loving you's a natural thing

Don't need no chains to bind me
Just your sweet love to guide me
Through the day and into the night
Oh loving you seems so right baby
Loving you's a natural thing

I was born when our lips came together
Now I'm a man feeling so much better yeah
Your love baby has got a hold on me
I know I never be free oh
You know this feelings got me
You showed me how it should be
Oh proving with you is so easy to do
Oh loving you's a natural thing baby
Loving you's a natural thing

I was born when our lips came together
Now I'm a man feeling so much better yeah
Your love baby has got a hold on me
I know I'll never be free now
Don't need no chains to bind me
Just your sweet love to guide me
Through the day and into the night
Oh loving you seems so right baby
Loving you's a natural thing
Hah woo you know this feelings got me
You showed me how it should be
Oh proving with you is so easy to do
Oh loving you's a natural thing baby
Loving you's a natural thing
