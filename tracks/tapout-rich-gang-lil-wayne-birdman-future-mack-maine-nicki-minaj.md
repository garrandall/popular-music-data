(Rich Gang!) If you hatin', you just need some pussy
(Rich Girl) She fucked up when she gave me some pussy
I said, "I fuck you better than that other nigga"
She say, "Tune I'm 'bout to cum," I say, "I'm cummin' wit ya"
She don't like them pretty niggas, sidity niggas
She ride this dick, her titties jiggle, that's my pillows
That's because I sleep in that ho, hit it when I wake up
Tell the pigs I say "As-salamu alaykum", uhh
My bitch a choosy lover, never fuck without a rubber
Sweet yellow-bone thing, I call her Honey Mustard
Pussy like a seashell, dick like a V-12
She say I drive her crazy, I say, "Just keep on your seatbelt"
Bend it over, bust it open for me
Baby bend it over, bust it open for me, yeah
She say she love me, she just loves this dick
Come put that million dollar pussy on me, make me rich
Tunechi! (bBatt!)


She got that million dollar
Million dollar oh, oh, oh
She got that million dollar
Million dollar oh, oh, oh
And all I want to do is touch it, touch it, touch it
Oh, oh, oh
Make her tap out, tap out
Tap out, tap out, tap out (yeah)
And I'ma make her tap out, tap out (all day, all night)
Tap out, tap out, tap out (yeah)


Crib made her tap out, sauna made her tap out
Jet made her tap out, pilot with the map out
Million on the diamonds, million on the kitchen
Millions on the Maybach, glass top ceilings
Million dollar pussy, sleepin' on Versace
Sleeping on Fendi, sleepin on Cavalli
Married to the money, millions in the bank
Alexander McQueen, rich in the paint


I got that fuck you if you love me on some nigga shit
She got the million dollar seven figure nigga rich
We switch positions like we doin' yoga in this bitch
She get to shakin' then stiff


She got that million dollar
Million dollar oh, oh, oh

Million dollar oh, oh, oh
And all I want to do is touch it (touch it, touch it)
Oh, oh, oh
Make her tap out, tap out
Tap out, tap out, tap out
And I'ma make her tap out, tap out
Tap out, tap out, tap out


Million dollar pussy, million dollar pussy (mm)
Six inch, pumps, play with his balls, dunks
Bald head, yup, don't want no Forrest, Gumps
Don't let me tell ya, twice, already told ya, once
(Eat that pussy)
Who-who-who-who-who got that baddest pussy on the planet?
D-boys love me, they don't understand it
Ohhhhh, deep throat
M-m-m-m-million dollar pussy might pounce on that ass
Threw them hundreds 'til I lose counts on that ass
Max out all of them accounts on that ass
Million dollar checks don't bounce on that ass
Pull up in that "you can't afford this"
Only rap bitch on the Forbes list
Pussy jewelry make em say "burr man"
*R-r-r-r-rubs hands like Birdman*


She got that million dollar (Rich Gang)
Million dollar oh, oh, oh (Rich Girl)
She got that million dollar
(Sexy Slim, I see you, paradise home, yeah)
Million dollar oh, oh, oh
(Flossing while you're shining, jumping out of Bugattis)
And all I want to do is touch it, touch it, touch it
Touch it and touch it and touch it, touch it
And I'ma make her tap out, tap out (yeah)
Tap out, tap out, tap out (fuck this money game up, wild out)
And I'ma make her tap out, tap out (yeah)
Tap out, tap out, tap out (Sweet D! Love you, baby girl)


I'm in love with your Egyptian skin
And your talk about religion
I'm in prison with the pussy
And I'm ballin', no cushion
