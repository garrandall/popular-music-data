* originally from Jermaine Dupri's "Young Fly & Flashy"


One two three
As it is plain to see
I go by the name of Jermaine Dupri
Dope Man Fresh in the place to be, and uh


Oh I think they like me
Oh I think they like oh I oh I think they like me
Oh I think they like oh I oh I think they like me


Oh I think they like me when they heard me on the other one
So its only right that I hit you with a (imitate record scratching)
Oh I think they like me when they heard me on the other one
So its only right that I hit you with another one


Yeah niggas like me, haters wanna fight me
Yeah these bitches mad cause I came up overnight, B
Yeah I switched it up, I got a 9 cuffed tightly
So you'd better do the right thing like Spike Lee
Yeah I'm super clean, rock jeans with a white tee
Niggas fucking soft but them niggas wanna bite me
If you had 6 figures you'd be just like me
Yeah these niggas mad cause I'm shining like a light beam
Niggas talkin bout YEP in they mother fucking throw back
He ain't real you know that, Muhammad where they sold that
We stepping on these niggas like a mother fucking door mat
When I hit the scene they take pictures, call me Kodak
These ho's goin crazy, yeah I think they need some prozac
We the hottest thing on the market and you know that
Ya bitch chosed up an she don't wanna go back
We stacking big faces cause we still spendin all that


When I do it, its something like the thriller in manilla man
Known as a killer man, fresh from the dealer man
So So niggas, ain't no crew illa than
10 acres of land and I got about a million
Dollars worth of cars in my front yard
I'm from the place in ATL where young niggas sling hard
Oh I think they like me when they heard me on the other one
So its only right that I hit you with another one
Remix, we gets busy over here, no sleep
Niggas stay up on their grizzy over here
We young (young), we fly (fly), we gonna stay flashy till the day that we die


Oh I think they like me
Oh I think they like oh I oh I think they like me
Oh I think they like me
Oh I think they like oh I oh I think they like me


They don't wanna fight me
I'm snatchin ya ass up
First nigga act up, the first nigga get bust
Majestic getting shredded while I'm twirling and switching so
T-shirt stravaganza, (Franchise, dem white tee boyz)
Self made self paid
We lounge around in our white tee
Ashy black shirt well deep down to ya brown tee
My hundred throwback who sport a jersey by Ali
And if he make one, hell naw they dont psych me
I'm all about my cash ride around wit a nice piece
Ear piece ice piece they straight like me
You heard pimping player (yeah they shine so brightly)
Don't stand so close vision blurs when ice blings
Respect my whole squad no you can't even touch us cuz
Role out the red carpet high 5 and show us love
Carry barrettas count cheddar we trendsetters
I'm a franchize nigga have a mil or betta


Check it out, Six 0, six four four, six nine four
Blow 'dro with the windows up on deuce four's
? candy paint, brand new, think I ain't
Same chick, same clique, more bricks in the bank
Know now, no ho round, throw down like Brat
It ain't no showdown for no crown, I'm holding that (thats right)
They saw me on VH, pay great till this day
Been in love with the mic since Run-D.M.C. walked this way
I talk this way cause I'm gangsta a chi-town legend
I'm not ordinary people it's a star in your presence
I'm so icy that my earlobes hurt for what its worth
Don't test me I got the four fifth under the skirt
Thick in the the thighs can't touch that
Stay on my grind, I bust back if I must act and empty a stack
Its B to the R-A-T trust that I'm crazy, JD pays me, I'm such a fucking lady


I'm Bow Weezy, prince of the O-town
Just got the wheels clean, so I'm riding slow now
I'm in a fast car, something like a NASCAR
If you wanna know how much it cost you should ask pa
As far as the watch and chain
I dropped some change, its easy for me to cop them things
And I don't stop, I got rocks and rings, you know
The same size as a boxing ring
Swimming pool in the front and the back yard
I ain't gotta act hard, I'm under 21 with a black card
And yea I know that was kind of a low blow
But the dough for the So So don't come slow


Oh I think they like me when they heard me on the other one
So its only right that I hit you with a (imitate record scratching)
Oh I think they like me when they heard me on the other one
So its only right that I hit you with another one
