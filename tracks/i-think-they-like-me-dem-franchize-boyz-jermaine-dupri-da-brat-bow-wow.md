 YUP!
 1, 2, 3 as this is plain to see
I go by the name of Jermaine Dupri
Dopeman fresh in the place to be
And uhh




Oh I think they like me when they heard me on the other one
So its only right that I hit you with another one



Yea these niggaz like me, haters want to fight me
Yea these niggaz mad cuz I came up over night B
Yea I switched it up I got 9 kuffed tightly
So you betta do the right thing like Spike Lee
Yep I'm super clean rock jeans wit a white tee
Niggaz round here soft but like niggaz want to bite me
If you had some figures you would be just like me
Yea these niggaz mad cuz I shining like a light B
Niggaz talking bout yep in there muthafuckin throwback
It ain't real you know dats muhammadz where dey sold that
We stepping on these niggaz like a muthafuckin door mat
When I hit the scene they take pictures call me Kodak
These hoes goin crazy like think they need some prozac
We the hottest thing in tha market and you no dat
Yo bitch chose us and she don't want to go back
We stackin big faces cuz we still spending throwbacks


Now when I do it its something like thrilla and manilla man
Known as a killa man fresh from the dealer man
So So niggas aint no crew illa than
10 acres of land and I got about a million
Dollars worth of cars in my front yard
I'm from a place in ATL where young niggas stomp hard
Ooo I think they like me when they heard me on the other one
So its only right that I hit you with another one
Remix we get busy over here
No sleep niggas stay up on they grizzie over here
We young (young), we fly (fly)
And we gon stay flashy till the day that we die




They don't want 2 fight me I'm snatching ya ass up
First nigga act up first nigga get bust
Majestic, gettin shredded while I'm twirlin n switchin up
T-shirt stravaganza (franchize the white tee boyz)
Self made self paid we lounge around in our white tee
Ashy black shirt well get down in ya brown tee
Muhammed throwback who'd sport a jersey by Ali
And if he make one (hell naw dat dont excite me!)
I'm all about my cash ride around wit a nice peace
Ear piece icy they straight up like me
You heard pimpin playa (they shine so brightly)
Don't stand so close vision blurs when ice blings
Respect my whole squad kno you can't even touch us cuz
Role out the red carpet high 5 and show us love
Carry barretas count cheddar we transedda
I'm a franchize niggga have a mil or betta


Check it out!
60644694 blow dro with the windows up on duece four's
Purple candy paint brand new think I aint
Same chick same click mo bricks in the bank
No now no hoe rounds no down like brat
It aint no showdown for no crown I'm holding that
Face all over VH paid great till this day
Been in love with the mic since Run DMC walk this way
Talk this way cause I'm gangsta, a chi-town legend
I'm not ordinary people its a star in yo presents
So icy that my earlobes hurt
But what its worth
Dont test me I got the four fitfth under the skirt
Thick in the thighs can tuck that I stay on my grind
I buss back if I must act I empty the sack
Its b to the r-a-t trust that I'm crazy
JD pays me I'm such acting lady


I'm bow weezy prince of the o-town
Just got the wheels clean so I'm riding slow now
I'm in a fast car something like a nascar
If you wanna know how much it cost you should ask pa
As far as the rocks in chain I dropped some change
Its easy for me to copped them thangs
And I dont stop I got rocks in rings
You know the same size as a boxing ring
Swimming pool in the front and the back yard
I aint got to act hard
I'm under 21 with a black card
Yea I know that was kind of a low blow
But the dough for the so so dont come slow




Oh I think they like me when they heard me on the other one
So its only right that I hit you with another one
