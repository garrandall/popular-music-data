He works way too much for way too little 
He drinks way too early till way too late 
He hasn't had a raise since new years day 
In eighty-eight gets trampled on by everyone 
Except when he comes in here 
And he's the product of the Haggard generation 
He's got a redneck side when you get him agitated 
He got the gold toothed look from a stiff right hook 
He's proud he took for his right wing stand on Vietnam 
Says he lost his brother there 

He yells out Johnny Cash 
And the band starts to play 
A ring of fire as he walks up 
And stands there by the stage 
And he says 

Hell yeah! 
Turn it up! 
Right on! 
Hell yeah! 
Sounds good! 
Sing that song! 
Guitar man playin' all night long 
Take me back to where the music hit me 
Life was good and love was easy 

She's got an MBA and a plush corner office 
She's got a don't mess with me attitude 
She'll close a deal she don't reveal that she can feel 
The loneliness the emptiness 
Except when she comes in here 
She's the product of the Me generation 
She's got a rock and roll side when you get her agitated 
She got the tattoo there on her derriere from a spring break dare 
In Panama where love was all she thought she'd ever need 

She yells out to the band 
Know any Bruce Springsteen 
Then she jumps up on the bar 
And she, and she starts to scream 
She says 

Hell yeah! 
Turn it up! 
Right on! 
Hell yeah! 
Sounds good! 
Sing that song! 
Guitar man playin' all night long 
Take me back to where the music hit me 
When life was good and love was easy 

Yeah, yeah 
Can or can't you get my mind off thinkin' 'bout 
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday 
Hey, hell yeah 

Hell yeah 
Turn it up 
Right on 
Hell yeah 
Sounds good 
Sing that song 
Guitar man playin' all night long 
Take me back to where the music hit me 
When life was good 

Hell yeah! 
Turn it up! 
Right on! 
Hell yeah! 
Sounds good! 
Sing that song! 
Guitar man playin' all night long 
Take me back to where the music hit me 
When life was good and love was easy
