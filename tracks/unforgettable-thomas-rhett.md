It was the 14th of October
Had that t-shirt off your shoulder
I was drunk, said I was sober
And you said yeah right
We were talkin' for a minute
Then some guy tried to cut in
You took my hand and we pretended
Like I was your guy

Oh, then I tried to guess your middle name
For 30 minutes bet we played that game

That mango-rita you were drinkin'
And that Coldplay song that you were singin'
And I bet right now you're probably thinkin'
That it's crazy I remember every detail, but I do
From your blue jeans to your shoes
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

We were dancin', we were buzzin'
Takin' shots like it was nothin'
Did the runnin' man, you loved it
Yeah, you laughed out loud
You brushed away your blonde hair
And you kissed me out of nowhere
I can still show you the spot
Where everything went down

Oh, I told you I was gonna marry you
You probably didn't think that it was true

That mango-rita you were drinkin'
And that Coldplay song that you were singin'
And I bet right now you're probably thinkin'
That it's crazy I remember every detail, but I do
I can still smell your perfume
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

Oh, that night was just like you, baby
I can taste the mango-rita you were drinkin'
And it feels just like it was last weekend
That we jumped in
Right off the deep end

That mango-rita you were drinkin'
And that Coldplay song that you were singin'
And I bet right now you're probably thinkin'
That it's crazy I remember every detail, but I do
I can still smell your perfume
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

From your blue jeans to your shoes
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable
