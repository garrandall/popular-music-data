Alright


Akon and MJ


This life don't last forever (hold my hand)
So tell me what we're waiting for (hold my hand)
We're better off being together (hold my hand)
Than being miserable alone (hold my hand)


'Cause I've been there before
And you've been there before
But together we can be alright.
'Cause when it gets dark
And when it gets cold
We hold each other 'til we see the sunlight


So if you just hold my hand
Baby I promise that I'll do all I can
Things will go better if you just hold my hand
Nothing can come between us if you just hold, hold my, hold, hold my, hold, hold my hand.


Hold my hand


The nights are getting darker (hold my hand)
And there's no peace inside (hold my hand)
So why make our lives harder? (hold my hand)
By fighting love tonight, baby! (so)


'Cause I've been there before
And you've been there before
But together we can be alright (alright)
'Cause when it gets dark
And when it gets cold
We hold each other 'til we see the sunlight

'Cause you could just hold my hand
Baby, I promise that I'll do all I can
(If you just, if you just)
Things will go better if you just hold my hand
Nothing can come between us if you just hold, hold my, hold, hold my, hold, hold my hand.


Hold my hand


I can tell that you're tired of being lonely
Take my hand don't let go baby hold me (hold me)
Come to me and let me be your one and only (hold my hand)
So I can make it alright 'til the morning (hold my hand)

I can tell that you're tired of being lonely (hold my hand)
Take my hand don't let go baby hold me (hold me)
Come to me and let me be your one and only (one and only)
'Cause I can make it alright 'til the morning (hold my hand)


Hold my hand
Baby I promise (hold my hand) that I'll do all I can (hold my hand)
Things will go better if you just hold my hand
Nothing can come between us if you just hold, hold my, hold, hold my, hold, hold my hand.

Hold my hand
All I can (hold my hand)
Hold my hand
Nothing can come between us if you just hold my, hold my, hold my hand.


Hold my hand
Hold my hand
