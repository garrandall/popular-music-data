She calls me Goliath and I wear the David mask
I guess the stones are coming too fast for her now
You know I'd like to believe this nervousness will pass
All the stones that are thrown are building up the wall
I have become cumbersome to this world
I have become cumbersome to my girl

I'd like to believe we could reconcile the past
Resurrect those bridges with an ancient glance
But my old stone face can't seem to break her down
She remembers bridges, burns them to the ground.
I have become cumbersome to this world
I have become cumbersome to my girl

Too heavy, too light
Too black or too white
Too wrong or too right
Today or tonight
Cumbersome
Too rich or too poor
She's wanting me less and I'm wanting her more
A bitter taste is cumbersome

There is a balance between two worlds
One with an arrow and a cross
Regardless of the balance
Life has become cumbersome

Too heavy, too light
Too black or too white
Too wrong or too right
Today or tonight
Cumbersome
Too rich or too poor
She's wanting me less and I'm wanting her more
A bitter taste is cumbersome

Your life has become cumbersome
