Come over my head
I'm in too deep
The hours getting late and it's time to leave

I missin' you before you 're gone
Don't understand
What's in my heart
I look at you and don't know where to start
Should I let it show
That something 's changin'
'Cause it's feeling so right and I hear myself saying:

You don't have to go home tonight
Stay until the light of day
Keep your smiling alive

Lay your heart next to mine
You don't have to go home tonight
So hard to go our separate ways
So better stay right here
You don't have to go home

There's a cool breathe blowing in the curtains way
I kiss your lips and you touch my face

Is this real
Or on my dreaming?
I wonder which you're thinkin' I can tell
If it's a found tomorrow we 'll fix itself
'Cause I don't wanna loose this feeling
When I look in your eyes I here myself saying:

You don't have to go home tonight
Stay until the light of day
Keep your smiling alive

Lay your heart next to mine
You don't have to go home tonight
So hard to go our separate ways
So better stay right here
You don't have to go home

There 's no hurry
I only want this moment

Want this moment to last

If you believe in love
Say where I do

Maybe this is a chance:
You don't have to go

You don't have to go home tonight
So hard to go our separate ways
So better stay right here
You don't have to go home

You don't have to go home tonight
Stay until the light of day
Keep your smiling alive

Lay your heart next to mine
You don't have to go home tonight
So hard to go our separate ways
So better stay right here
You don't have to go home

You don't have to go home tonight
Stay until the light of day
Keep your smiling alive

Lay your heart next to mine
You don't have to go home tonight
So hard to go our separate ways
So better stay right here
You don't have to go home
