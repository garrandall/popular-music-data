A full moon shining bright
Edge of the water we were feelin' alright
Back down a country road
The girls are always hot and the beer is ice cold

Cadillac horns on the hood
My buddy Jay had his dad hook him up good
Girls smiled when we rolled by
They'd hop in the back and we'd cruise to the river side

Woah oh, never gonna grow up
Woah oh, never gonna slow down
Woah oh, we were shining like lighters in the dark in the middle of a rock show
Woah oh, we were doing it right
Woah oh, we were comin' to life
Woah oh, caught up in a southern summer barefoot blue jean night

Blue eyes and auburn hair
Sittin' looking pretty by the fire in a lawn chair
New to town and new to me
Her ruby red lips were sippin' on a sweet tea
Shot me a look like a shootin' star
So I grabbed a beer and my old guitar
Then we sat around 'til the break of dawn
Howlin' and singin' our favorite songs

Woah oh, never gonna grow up
Woah oh, never gonna slow down
Woah oh, we were shining like lighters in the dark in the middle of a rock show
Woah oh, we were doing it right
Woah oh, we were comin' to life
Woah oh, caught up in a southern summer barefoot blue jean night

Woah oh, never gonna grow up
Woah oh, never gonna slow down
Woah oh, we were shining like lighters in the dark in the middle of a rock show
Woah oh, we were doing it right
Woah oh, we were comin' to life
Woah oh, caught up in a southern summer barefoot blue jean night

Barefoot blue jean night
Barefoot blue jean night
Barefoot blue jean night

Woah oh
Barefoot blue jean night
Woah oh
Barefoot blue jean night
Woah oh
Barefoot blue jean night
That's right
Barefoot blue jean night
