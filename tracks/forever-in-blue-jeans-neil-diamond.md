Money talks
But it don't sing and dance and it don't walk
Long as I can have you here with me
I'd much rather be
Forever in blue jeans

Honey's sweet
But it ain't nothin' next to baby's treat
And if you pardon me I'd like to say
We'll do ok
Forever In Blue Jeans

Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight, by the fire all alone you and I
Nothing around but the sound of my heart and your sighs

Money talks
But it don't sing and dance and it don't walk
Long as I can have you here with me
I'd much rather be
Forever in blue jeans

Honey's sweet
But it ain't nothin' next to baby's treat
And if you pardon me I'd like to say
We'll do ok
Forever In Blue Jeans

Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight, you and I all alone by the fire
Nothing around but the sound of my heart and your sighs

Money talks
But it don't sing and dance and it don't walk
Long as I can have you here with me
I'd much rather be
Forever in blue jeans

And if you pardon me I'd like to say
We'll do ok
Forever In Blue Jeans

Long as I can have you here with me
I'd much rather be
Forever in blue jeans...
