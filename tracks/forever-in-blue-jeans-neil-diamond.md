Money talks
But it don't sing and dance
And it don't walk
And long as I can have you
Here with me, I'd much rather be
Forever in blue jeans


Honey's sweet
But it ain't nothin' next to baby's treat
And if you pardon me
I'd like to say
We'd do okay
Forever in blue jeans


Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight, by the fire
All alone you and I
Nothing around
But the sound of my heart
And your sighs


Money talks
But it can't sing and dance
And it can't walk
And long as I can have you
Here with me, I'd much rather be
Forever in blue jeans, babe


And honey's sweet
But it ain't nothin' next to baby's treat
And if you pardon me I'd like to say
We'd do okay
Forever in blue jeans


Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight, by the fire
All alone you and I
Nothing around
But the sound of my heart
And your sighs


Money talks
But it don't sing and dance
And it don't walk
And long as I can have you
Here with me
I'd much rather be
Forever in blue jeans


And if you pardon me
I'd like to say
We'd do okay
Forever in blue jeans, babe
And long as I can have you
Here with me
I'd much rather be
Forever in blue jeans, babe
Long as I can have you
Here with me
I'd much rather be...
