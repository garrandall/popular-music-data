(I've no regrets)
No regrets, no regrets
I'm living a life that I chose
(I've no regrets)
Been a lotta places, oh, yeah
And seen a lotta things
(I've no regrets)
Even when I'm sad
You still can hear me sing
If it should be, I say
That he called me today
Well, I've no regrets
For this life I live
(I've no regrets)
No regrets, no regrets
I'm living a life that I chose
(I've no regrets)
Been a lotta places, oh, yeah
And seen a lotta things
(I've no regrets)
Even when I'm sad
You still can hear me sing
If it should be, I say
That he called me today
Well, I've no regrets
For this life I live
(No regrets, no regrets)
(No regrets, no regrets)...
Got a good woman
Good loving
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, I'm so happy
I wanna shout
(I've no regrets)
No regrets, no regrets
I'm living a life that I chose
(I've no regrets)
Been a lotta places, oh, yeah
And seen a lotta things
(I've no regrets)
Even when I'm sad
You still can hear me sing
If it should be, I say
That he called me today
Well, I've no regrets
For this life I live
