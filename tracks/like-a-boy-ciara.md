C-I-A-R-A


Pull up your pants (Just like em')
Take out the trash (Just like em')
Getting ya cash like 'em, fast like 'em
Girl, you outta act like ya dig (What I'm talkin' bout')
Security codes on everything
On vibrate so your phone don't ever ring (Joint account)
And another one he don't know about


Wish we could switch up the roles
And I could be that
Tell you I love you, but when you call, I never get back
Would you ask them questions like me?
Like where you be at?
'Cause I'm out four in the morning
On the corner, rolling, doing my own thing, oh


What if I
Had a thing on the side?
Made ya cry?
Would the rules change up
Or would they still apply?
If I played you like a toy
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy


Can't be getting mad
What you mad?
Can't handle that!
Can't be getting mad
What you mad?
Can't handle that


Girl, go 'head and be (Just like 'em)
Go run the streets (Just like 'em)
Come home and sleep like em'
Creep like em'
Front with ya friends
Act hard when you're with em' like em' (What?)
Keep a straight face when ya tell a lie
Always keep an air-tight alibi (Keep him in the dark)
What he don't know won't break his heart


Wish we could switch up the roles
And I could be that
Tell you I love you, but when you call, I never get back
Would you ask them questions like me?
Like where you be at?
'Cause I'm out four in the morning
On the corner, rolling, doing my own thing, oh


What if I
Had a thing on the side?
Made ya cry?
Would the rules change up
Or would they still apply?
If I played you like a toy
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy


Can't be getting mad
What you mad?
Can't handle that
Can't be getting mad
What you mad?
Can't handle that
Can't be getting mad
What you mad?
Can't handle that
Can't be getting mad
What you mad?
Can't handle that


If I was always gone
With the sun getting home (Would ya like that?)
Told you I was with my crew
When I knew it wasn't true (Would ya like that?)
If I act like you
Walk A mile off in yo shoes (Would ya like that?)
I'm messing with your head again
Dose of your own medicine


What if I
Had a thing on the side? (What if I?)
Made ya cry?
Would the rules change up
Or would they still apply?
If I played you like a toy
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy


Can't be getting mad
What you mad?
Can't handle that
Can't be getting mad
What you mad?
Can't handle that
Can't be getting mad
What you mad?
Can't handle that
Can't be getting mad
What you mad?
Can't handle that


R-A
It's The Clutch
If I played you (It's Ciara, ha ha)
Would yo like that?
Had friends...
Would you like that? (It's Ciara, ha ha)
Never call?
Would you like that? (Another one)
Hell naw
You wouldn't like that
No!


What you mad?
Can't handle that
(What if I made you cry?)
Why you getting mad?
What you mad?
Can't handle that
Would they still apply?


What if I
If I, played you like a toy
Made ya cry?
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy
Can't handle that
