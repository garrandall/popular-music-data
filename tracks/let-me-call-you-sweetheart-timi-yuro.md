Let me call you sweetheart
I'm in love, mmm, with you
Oh, let me hear you whisper
That you love, oh, you love me too

Keep the love light glowing
In your heart so true
C'mon, let me call you sweetheart
I'm in love with you

Yeah, let, c'mon, let me call you sweetheart
I, I'm in love, so in love with you
Let, won't you let me hear
Won't you let me hear you whisper
That you love, that you love, you love me too?

And you've got to keep, keep the love light glowing
In your heart, yeah, in your heart so true
Hey now, let, won't you let me call?
Won't you let me call you my little sweetheart?

I'm in love, everybody knows I'm in love
Yes, I'm in love with you
Now, one more time, I'm in love
Everyone knows I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love with you, yeah, yeah
