There's a dance called the Watusi it's out of sight,
First you slide to the left then to the right.
The Watusi is out of sight,
You slide to the left, then to the right.
Take two steps up and keep it tight.
And do the Watusi, it sure is a sight.
Come, on try, sugar pie,
Keep with the beat and Watusi, Watusi with me.
Shimmy and shoulder and slop with your feet,
And wiggle your hips in time to the beat,
You do the Bow and Arrow, come out on the Horse,
And Pigmy Shuffle, when you take your choice.
Come, on try, sugar pie,
There's a dance called the watusi it's out of sight,
First you slide to the left then to the right.
Two steps forward, keep it tight.
There's a dance called the Watusi it's out of sight.
Don't stop now, I'm really not thru,
There's so many more steps that you can do,
Well the Dish Rag, the Stiff, the Boy Pete,
The Double Watusi, honey, in time with the beat,
Come, on try, sugar pie,
It's easy to do, and Watusi, Watusi with me.
