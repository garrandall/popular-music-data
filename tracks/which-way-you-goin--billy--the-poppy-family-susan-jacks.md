Which way you goin', Billy?
Can I go too?
Which way you goin', Billy?
Can I go with you?

I really love you, Billy
And all this time
I thought you loved me, Billy
And you were mine

I'm gonna miss you, Billy
And though I'm trying
I'm hurtin' so bad, Billy
I can't help cryin'

You are my whole babe
My heart and my soul babe
I'd have nothing to show babe
If you should go away

You are my whole babe
My heart and my soul babe
I'd have nothing to show babe
If you should go

Which way you goin', Billy?
Or need I ask?
'Cause you don't want me, Billy
You're free at last

I won't forget you, Billy
For all my life
I'll always love you, Billy
I'll stay your wife

You are my whole babe
My heart and my soul babe
I'd have nothing to show babe
If you should go away

You are my whole babe
My heart and my soul babe
I'd have nothing to show babe
If you should go

You are my whole babe
My heart and my soul babe
I'd have nothing to show babe
If you should go away
