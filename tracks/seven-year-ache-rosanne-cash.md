You act like you were just born tonight
Face down in a memory but feeling all right
So who does your past belong to today
Baby, you don't say nothing when you're feeling this way

Girls in the bars thinking who is this guy
But they don't think nothing when they're telling you lies
You look so careless when they're shooting that bull
Don't you know heartaches are heroes when their pockets are full

Tell me you're trying to cure a seven year ache
See what else your old heart can take
Boys say, "when is he gonna give us some room"
The girls say, "God, I hope he comes back soon"

And everybody's talking but you don't hear a thing
You're still uptown on your downhill swing
Boulevard's empty, why don't you come around
Baby, what is so great about sleeping downtown

There's plenty of dives to be someone you're not
Just say you're looking for something you might have forgot
Don't bother calling to say you're leaving alone
'Cause there's a fool on every corner when you're trying to get home

Just tell 'em your trying to cure a seven year ache
See what else your old heart can take
Boys say, "when is he gonna give us some room"
The girls say, "God, I hope he comes back soon"

Tell me you're trying to cure a seven year ache
See what else your old heart can take
Boys say, "when is he gonna give us some room"
The girls say, "God, I hope he comes back soon"
