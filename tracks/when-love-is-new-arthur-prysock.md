When love is new, love is new
(When love is new, love is new)

When love is new

Every day is a new sensation

When love is new

You thrill with infatuation

Oh, ho, ho
When love is born
It's so warm, so soft
And, oh, so tender
Everybody's willing to surrender

When love is new (When love is new, love is new)
When love is new (When love is new, love is new)

Don't let our love grow cold
'Cause funny things happen
When that love gets cold
So let's me and you make a pact
A promise to each other

For as long as we live
Long as we love, let's always
Always keep our love brand new
'Cause love is so wonderful

When love is new (When love is new, love is new)
I said when love is new (When love is new, love is new)

Whoa, ho, ho, oh
When love is born
(When love is born)
It's so warm, so soft
And, oh, so tender
Everybody's willing to surrender

When love is new (When love is new, love is new)
When love is new (When love is new, love is new)
It's so wonderful

When love is new (When love is new, love is new)
Al we need is each other
(When love is new, love is new) To keep our love brand new

It's so warm, soft
Sweet and so tender

(When love is new, love is new) It's so soft, so sweet
(When love is new, love is new) And, oh, so tender

(When love is new, love is new)
It's so good to you, baby
(When love is new, love is new)
It makes you feel brand new

(When love is new, love is new)
