Up in the morning, out on the job
And I work like the devil for my pay


I know that a lucky old sun has nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day


I fuss with my woman and I toil with my kids
I sweat till I'm wrinkled and gray




Dear Lord above, don't you see I'm pining
I got tears all in my eyes
Why don't You send down that cloud
With a silver lining, lift me up to paradise
(Lift me up to paradise)


Show me that river, why don't You take me across
And wash all my troubles away
