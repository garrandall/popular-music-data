Yo...
Who's afraid, of the big, bad, BAT
Who issss, the Batman kid?
It's me (heh) (I ain't afraid of NUTTIN)
Word up, let's do it (of NUTTIN)



I got your mind twisted (twisted)
Unrealistic wavelength draining on your brain-strip inflicted
Crossword puzzling your delf
Questioning your own mental health (yeah) it's like a maze within itself
(yeah) Check the grimey, slimey, crimey
Crim-inim-inal indivi-dual I be
Searching for the Dark Knight
Lurking in the shadows of the city, he roll with jiggy
My rhyme committee, robbing every Gotham piggy bank blinnnnnnnd
Take a journey through the mind of a Riddler



Tax free money not a problem
A heist to get the ice not a problem
A body for a price not a problem
Hmmmmmmm.... it's The Riddler



Once again it's the mind bender, three-time felony offender
Demented, brain cemented, mixed in the blender
I lose ya, mass-confusion, question mark clues in
What where why whose-it, QUIZZZ
Time to ask yourself who it is
Sheisty P.L.O. underhanded biz, invading brothers wigs
Can I live
Corrupt and bringing all the misery and suffering
Pain, you couldn't cure with a Bufferin
Rotating, ridiculous, rapid-fire riddles
Bat get trapped in the middle of The Riddler



Murder for the evil not a problem
To the gen there is no sequel not a problem (not a problem)
Big up to all my people not a problem (not a problem)
Hmmmmmmm... it's the Riddler



Observe if you will
I'm in my hide-out in the back of the hill (of the hill)
I crack a wall then I caught about a mil (bout a millll)
Co-defendant Johnny Blaze and Bobby Steels (Bobby Steels)
We was blazing hardware (hardware)
Turn the corner you can hear the wheels squeel 
On that ass fast was the Batmobile (Batmobile)
I could tell by the demon on the grill, this was real
Alley-cat screaming, I hit a trash can
Garbage everywhere, money flying out the bags and
trying to escape, jiggy with the cape
Or else he'd be headed upstate, it's The Riddler



Talkin homicide, not a problem (that's no problem)
You want to talk genocide not a problem (that's no problem)
Now if you're speaking genocide not a problem (that's no problem)
Hmmmmmmm.... for The Riddler



Johnny Blaze, I invest in crime cuz it pays
Mad scams, let me count the ways, a crime wave
I make a killing, on the first one to point his finger at the villian
Who be I, the priiimmmmmme
Suspect, crim-inim-inal intellect
Robbing banks HAH down to grand theft what we want
is it all, every seal on every door, every wallllll
Until the jig is called on The Riddler
