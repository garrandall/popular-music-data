Intro:

Dead crosswords puzzling your delf
See that's what I'm talkin bout
When you take the Johnny Blaze
And you take that game and you plug that here into Bobby Steels
Now, you are playing with power
With power
With power


I got your mind twisted
Unrealistic wavelength draining on your brain-strip inflicted
Crossword puzzling your delf
Questioning your own mental health, yeah, it's like a maze within itself
Yeah, Check the grimey, slimey, crimey
Crim-inim-inal indivi-dual I be
Searching for the Dark Knight
Lurking in the shadows of the city, he roll with jiggy
My crime committee, robbing every Gotham piggy bank blind
Take a journey through the mind of a Riddler



Tax free money not a problem
A heist to get the ice not a problem
A body for a price not a problem
It's The Riddler



Once again it's the mind bender, three-time felony offender
Demented, brain cemented, mixed in the blender
I lose ya, mass-confusion, question mark clues in
What where why whose-it, quiz
Time to ask yourself who it is
Sheisty P.L.O. underhanded biz, invading brothers wigs
Can I live corrupt and bringing all the misery and suffering
Pain, you couldn't cure with a Bufferin
Rotating, ridiculous, rapid-fire riddles
Bat get trapped in the middle of The Riddler



Murder for the evil not a problem
To the gen there is no sequel not a problem
Big up to all my people not a problem
It's the Riddler



Observe if you will
I'm in my hide-out in the back of the hill
I crack a wall then I caught about a mil
Co-defendant Johnny Blaze and Bobby Steels
We was blazing hot wheels
Turn the corner you can hear the wheels squeal
On that ass fast was the Batmobile
I could tell by the demon on the grill, this was real
Alley-cat screaming, I hit a trash can
Garbage everywhere, money flying out the bags and
Trying to escape, code nine with the cape
Or else he'd be headed upstate, it's The Riddler



Talking suicide, not a problem
If you're speaking homicide, not a problem
You want to talk genocide not a problem
That's not a problem, for The Riddler


Word up, that's no problem
Stim-ulim-uli, stim-ulim-uli
Feel good don't it
And you know it
Got the, hotter
You're playing... with... power
