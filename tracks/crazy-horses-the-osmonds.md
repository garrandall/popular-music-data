There's a message floatin' in the air
Come from crazy horses ridin' everywhere
It's a warning, it's in every tongue
Gotta stop them crazy horses on the run

What a show, there they go smokin' up the sky yeah
Crazy horses all got riders, and they're you and I

Crazy horses
Crazy horses

Never stop and they never die
They just keep on puffin' how they multiply
Crazy horses, will they never halt
If they keep on movin' then it's all our fault

What a show, there they go smokin' up the sky yeah
Crazy horses all got riders, and they're you and I

Crazy horses
Crazy horses

So take a good look around
See what they've done
What they've done
They've done
They've done
They've done
They've done...

Crazy horses
Crazy horses

There's a message floatin' in the air
Come from crazy horses ridin' everywhere
It's a warning, it's in every tongue
Gotta stop them crazy horses on the run

What a show, there they go smokin' up the sky yeah
Crazy horses all got riders, and they're you and I

Crazy horses
Crazy horses

Crazy horses
Crazy horses
