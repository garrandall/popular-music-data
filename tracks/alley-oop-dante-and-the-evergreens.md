(Dallas Frazier)

(Oop-oop, oop, oop-oop)
(Alley Oop, oop, oop, oop-oop)
There's a man in the funny papers we all know
(Alley Oop, oop, oop, oop-oop)
He lived 'way back a long time ago
(Alley Oop, oop, oop, oop-oop)
He don't eat nothin' but a bear cat stew
(Alley Oop, oop, oop, oop-oop)
Well, this cat's name is-a Alley Oop
(Alley Oop, oop, oop, oop-oop)
(Alley Oop) He's the toughest man there is alive
(Alley Oop) Wearin' clothes from a wildcat's hide
(Alley Oop) He's the king of the jungle jive
(Look at that cave man go!) (SCREAM)
(Alley Oop, oop, oop, oop-oop)
He got a chauffeur that's a genuwine dinosawruh
(Alley Oop, oop, oop, oop-oop)
And he can knuckle your head before you count to fawruh
(Alley Oop, oop, oop, oop-oop)
He got a big ugly club and a head fulla hairuh
(Alley Oop, oop, oop, oop-oop)
Like great big lions and grizzly bearuhs
(Alley Oop, oop, oop, oop-oop)
(Alley Oop) He's the toughest man there is alive
(Alley Oop) Wearin' clothes from a wildcat's hide
(Alley Oop) He's the king of the jungle jive
(Look at that cave man go!) (SCREAM)
(Alley Oop, oop, oop, oop-oop)
He rides thru the jungle tearin' limbs offa trees
(Alley Oop, oop, oop, oop-oop)
Knockin' great big monstahs dead on their knees
(Alley Oop, oop, oop, oop-oop)
The cats don't bug him cuz they know bettah
(Alley Oop, oop, oop, oop-oop)
Cuz he's a mean motah scootah and a bad go-gettah
(Alley Oop, oop, oop, oop-oop)
(Alley Oop) He's the toughest man there is alive
(Alley Oop) Wearin' clothes from a wildcat's hide
(Alley Oop) He's the hullie-gullie king of jive
(Look at that cave man go!) (SCREAM)
Thair he goes
(Alley Oop, oop, oop, oop-oop)
Look at that cave man go
(Alley Oop, oop, oop, oop-oop)
Ride, Daddy, ride
(Alley Oop, oop, oop, oop-oop)
Hi-yo dinosawruh
