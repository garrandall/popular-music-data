Let it fade to black
Let me run my fingers down your back
Lets whisper, letâs donât talk
Baby, leave my T-shirt in the hall

Like a needle finds a groove,
Baby, weâll remember what to do
To drown out every distraction,
Itâs time we made it happen

Strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Letâs get it found
Strip it down, down, down

I wanna drop this cell phone now
And let it shatter on the ground
They ainât holdinâ nothinâ these two hands
Until theyâre holding you again

Oh, strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Letâs get it found
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down

I donât wanna let you go
No, not tonight
I just wanna love you so bad, baby
So lets close our eyes

And strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Letâs get it found
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down

Strip it down, down, down
