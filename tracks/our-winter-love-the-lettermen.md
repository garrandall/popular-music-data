Love born in winter time warms
This heart of mine with dancing fire
Of sweet desire
We've found our winter love

Eyes cold as fallen tears grow
Be chilling fears of loneliness
How could I guess?
We've found our winter love

Now armed, the world is warm, warm
Through cold and storm, we've found a fire
Of sweet desire
We've found our winter love

We've found our winter love
We've found our winter love
We've found our winter love
We've found our winter love
