I can't disguise the pounding of my heart
It beats so strong
It's in your eyes, what can I say?
They turn me on


I don't care where we go
I don't care what we do
I don't care, pretty baby
Just take me with you


Come on and touch the place in me
That's calling out your name
We want each other oh so much
Why must we play this game?


I don't care where we go
I don't care what we do
I don't care, pretty baby
Just take me with you


I don't care if we spend the night at your mansion
I don't care if we spend the night on the town
All I want is to spend the night together
All I want is to spend the night in your arms


To be around you is so-oh right
You're sheer perfection (thank you)
Drive me crazy, drive me all night
Just don't break up the connection


I don't care where we go
I don't care what we do
I don't care, pretty baby
Just take me with you
I don't care where we go
I don't care what we do
I don't care, pretty baby
Just take me with you


Just take me with you
Won't you take me with you?
Honey, take me with you
Whoo hoo hoo
Oooooo
