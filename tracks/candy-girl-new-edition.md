My girls like candy, a candy treat
She knocks me hot up off me feet
She's so fine as can be
I know this girl is meant for me

Candy Girl
You are my world
You look so sweet
You're a special treat

Candy girl
All I want to say
When you're with me
You brighten up my day

All I know
When I'm with you
You make me feel so good
Through and through
The way you walk
And the way you talk
You always look so good
You make me forget my thoughts

Do you really love me (do you really love me)
Don't you really care (don't you really care)
Do you really need me (do you really need me)
And will you always be there

Every night
And everyday
I'm always thinking of you
In every way

All I know
When I'm with you
You make me feel so good
Through and through

Do you really love me (do you really love me)
Don't you really care (don't you really care)
Do you really need me (do you really need me)
And will you always be there

Candy girl
You are my world
You're everything, everything.
Everything to me

Candy girl
All I want to say
I need your love
Each and everyday

Hey fellas
What
Check out Mike & Bobby's little lady
Oh eeh
Well check out Ricky & Ralph's
Oh eeh
What about Ronnie's
She's bad
She's bad
I know she's bad

She walks so fast she looks so sweet
She makes my heart just skip a beat
My girl the best and that's no lie
She tells me that I'm her only guy
That might be true but my girls a joy
She don't play around, she's right to the point
My girls like candy a candy treat
She knocks me hot up off my feat

Ah candy
You look so sweet

Ah candy
You're a special treat

Candy (you're my candy)
Candy girl (candy)
Candy (you're my candy)
Candy girl (candy)

Candy girl
You are my world
I need your love
Each and everyday

Candy girl
All I want to say
You're everything, everything
Everything to me

Candy girl
You are my world
I need your love
Each and everyday

Candy girl

I need it
Need it
Need it
Need it
Need it everyday

Candy girl
You are my world
I need your love
Each and everyday

Candy girl
All I want to say
You're everything, everything
Everything to me
