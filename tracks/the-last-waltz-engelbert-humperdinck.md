I wondered should I go or should I stay
The band had only one more song to play
And then I saw you out the corner of my eyes
A little girl alone and so shy
I had the last waltz with you
Two lonely people together
I fell in love with you
The last waltz should last forever
But the love we had was goin' strong
Through the good and bad we'd get along
And then the flame of love died in your eye
My heart was broke in two when you said goodbye
I had the last waltz with you
Two lonely people together
I fell in love with you
The last waltz should last forever
It's all over now 
Nothing left to say
Just my tears and the orchestra playing
La la la la la la la la la la,
La la la la la la la la la la. 
I had the last waltz with you
Two lonely people together
I fell in love with you
The last waltz should last forever
La la la la la la la la la la
