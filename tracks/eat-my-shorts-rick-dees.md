If Michael Jackson came alive right now
Heâd ask you to smoke one for him
So in his honorâ¦
(lights)


You niggas Spud Webb, cominâ up short
Think youâre Dee Brown, jump if you want
I put it on my momma and her very last nerve
Ricky made off everything I deserved
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
Do the math, Iâm a muthafuckinâ G nigga


Itâs all on me now, as you can see now
Iâm gonâ get this money and I will not be denied
Been shittinâ on you fucks a long time, time to pee now
When you finish first they hate you worse, startinâ to see now
Iâm at the round table, where your seat at?
Where your plate? where your lobster? where your sea bass?
We ainât never left, actinâ like we back
You should see us now, taking pictures, acting like we rap
This the circle thatâll murk you, blackout, short circuit
Somebody show them square ass niggas the first exit
This here reserved for soldiers most definite
So watch what you say and where you step more carefully
If I fall in the field and ainât no more air for me
Pour some on the ground and put one in the air for me
Tell my enemies âfuck âemâ, they know already but fuck âem
Tell âem again with a middle finger and a chuckle (hahahaa)
You donât know now nigga, nope, uh uh
This famous thatâll still throw copper
Cross so heavy crack the tabernacle
Fire the ganja back up
throw some blow in my tobacco
Then crank the Lac up
One match left
This the last turn, Santeria candles in my sanctuary burn
Iâma earn âtil the last court adjourn
âTil the last gavel drop, we gonâ have it locked
We gonâ have it locked (have it locked)
We gonâ have it locked (have it locked)


Iâm part of the small percentage of niggas who make it out the ghetto
But niggas tried to pull me back cause misery loves company
Itâs funny how they come for me when they see me living comfortably
But when I was broke and sleeping on floors they ainât want nothing from me
My futureâs so bright but my past so ugly
And I just try to correct it all but it all still haunts me
Tried to section off the past but it still haunts me
So I accept what got me here, reflecting in this rocking chair
All this space created, all that hard work it got me here
So what I look like, tellinâ a nigga that I should be here
Power to the people so the people shouldnât live in fear
And Iâll be that raising voice and tell the people treat us fair
Warring in the streets tell them soldiers to meet us there
Out in the open all alone I felt the coldest air
Secluded in my thoughts of fear
No one to talk to, no one there
Not even a voice, not even an ear
No one alive, no one to care
Now I got a power circle, now Iâm on a power trip
And they calling me counterfeit cause I ainât gave a coward shit
Stone me, throw me a pile of shit but you wonât pull me out of it
Itâs funny how it comes full circle
Now they wanna be a part of the power circle
They wanna be a part of the power circle


May the wind be at your back
May the bad be in your past
May the kids take all your good
And your wife have class
And you realize your goals
And whatâs life without grind
Those niggas, yo niggas?
Hope them niggas real as mine


Thereâs a difference between underrated and hasnât made it
Once you successful they relentlessly giving you hatred
Thereâs no applause for ya and success is hard for ya
Thereâs enemies, envy, but green my niggas lawnmower
And Iâm on tour, Jordan 4â²s, Tom Ford
And I ainât thugginâ, they clappinâ at me, a encore
Got a dark heart, bright mind, make women crazy
I give her D, I throw up two, I call that shit a safety
Shit is crazy when entertainment ain't entertaining
And my inner sanctum need real estate Iâm out my cabeza
Jealousyâs for the weak, you ain't happy I made it
I be feeling like brother Malcolm, just added a nation
Allah got us cause if we holla theyâll all snub us
I seen hustlas turn cluckers out niggas grandmothers
So shut the fuck up and listen, fuck all âem stuck up musicians
My circleâs small but regardless, my circumference official
My clothes different like quarterbacks at a closed scrimmage
They gonâ blitz us but ainât no way that they gonâ hit us
Iâm so allusive, some my niggas be going through it
I guess itâs a wrap when your co-defendant makes soul music
Cash rule the world, at least it do with girls
At least it do with Churches, see the truth and true it hurts
If they real, then they real, my niggas deserve it
And we donât deal with weak squares in this power circle
We donât deal with weak squares in this power circle


Iâm like welcome to the power circle
I came a long way, I started with a powdered circle
Clique full of real niggas thatâll probably murk you
Cause they about that murder game you do a lot of verbal
Lotta talking, lotta Tweeting, âtil you hear that chopper speaking
Kill my dog, I kill your dog, we tied even, Iâd believe it
If you see it then you got it, nigga never give up
Cause if you grindinâ you gonâ be rich before you can look up
My cousin Knock told me never teach niggas to cook up
Cause you can sell âem hard for the low and give âem the hookup
And still make the profit
The streets say Iâm the hottest and a nigga still modest
Iâm just being honest
Back to the wall, never let âem get behind us
Mack in my draws fitting right in my designers
Look at my persona, I dreamed it, woke up and conquered
And there was commas after commas, I eat âem like Benihanas
Put the shrimp over the pasta, the pasta over the lobster
And the lobster over the table, power circle a mafia
Just talkinâ money, talkinâ money what you talkinâ bout?
Probably talkinâ bout us, we the only thing to talk about
We the only thing to talk about
We the only thing to talk about


Look inside the highs of the last Mohicans survived
You wonât last a weekend outside
Seen a pastor tweaking, then sunk his teeth in a rock his demise
Later on that evening you heard the grieving of angels that cried
See a demon donât compromise
And so I walk alone with a cross and a diamond stone
Iâm a diamond inside the rough thatâs too mighty for maricons
I might as well put all my killers in YSL
Put my voice on this microphone, put you pussy niggas through hell
Hellâs fire, I never lie, you will never grind
I know the priors they runninâ by us when we do crime
I know that section eight wanna discontinue my Moms
When they heard that Ohio state gave me 30 racks in July
Oh Lord, this canât be life, no it canât be life
When they day breaks and you earned them stripes and you learned that strike
From upstate will adjourn that life and confirm that life
Itâs good bait for the warden that might get awarded and write
Now your fate can record it a reporter replied
The death rate will eventually climb, so eventually Iâm
On a track race for the dough before time get a clock that resigns
So about face if it ainât business, I get offended, I mind
No one fake, Iâm a realist in strive, of a bilion in five
Well a billion cause the limit is the sky and I live on cloud nine
And I recognize my nemesis gonâ try but Iâm finishing my shine
But pussy, where it hurt you
Life in the power circle


Regardless of how it goes down
Life goes on, am I right?
Tried to warn you niggas
I tried to warn you niggas
Itâs too late now
Double M-G
Too much cake
Too much power
Too much respect
Bow down, nigga
UHN!
