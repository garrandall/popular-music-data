Mama raised us all her life
And now it's her turn to live, yeah
Mama gave us everything, boy
Now it's our turn to give

Little brother
Brother, don't you know?
You got the best mother
That the world has ever known
Worked her fingers to the bone
Now you're almost grown
And out on your own
She got the right to be left alone

I'm twenty, you're sixteen
And, brother, that's a-plenty
'Cause when I came on the scene
Mama was only seventeen
So she's still a young woman
If you know what I mean

She got the right
To the man of her dreams, yeah
(Talkin' 'bout mama)
She got the right
To the man of her dreams
Say it again, now
She got the right
To the man of her dreams, oh...

Mama raised us all her life
And now it's her turn to live
Her turn to live

Ooh, mama raised us all her life, oh...
And now it's her turn to live
Oh, brother, now
Mama gave us everything, boy
And now it's you're turn to give
Well, well, well

He loves our mama, loves mama
Mama loves him
And that could never harm her
But what hurts her is when a man comes in
(Yeah)
You know, give him a chance to be your friend

She got the right to be loved again
Talkin' about mama
She got the right to be loved again
She got the right to be loved again

Mama raised us all her life
Now it's her turn to live
(Her turn to live)
Ooh, brother, now
Mama gave us everything
Now it's our turn to give

Her turn to live
And our turn to give
Her turn to live
And our turn to give

Mama got the right
Mama got the right
Mama got the right
Mama got the right to live now
