Alright... 

Well you tell me you want me
You say that you really care
Don't you tell me no lies
When you leave me, honey
You're gonna have a cross to bear

For there's two kinds of people I just can't stand
That's a lyin' woman or a beggin' man
Ain't nobody else gonna take my place
'Cause I'm just a fool for a pretty face


I been kicked, I been had 
But it didn't hurt a little bit
Kicked, pricked, no stick 
Really not my finger?
I've been hurt by love, oh yeah, 
Hurt by love
I've been hurt by love
I've been hurt by love
I'm just a fool for a pretty face, oh yeah

Well I don't have no reason
To?
So why don't you keep your big mouth shut
Why don't you let your love light shine?
I don't wanna hurt ya 
But you can?
I'm just a fool for a pretty face, oh yeah



Alright... 

Listen now 

You seem so oh-so sweet
But how about your after-taste?
I've been hurt by love so many times before
Because I'm a fool for a pretty face



Hurt by love
I tell ya I've been hurt by love
Hurt by love
Hurt by love
I'm just a fool for a... 
For a... 
For a... pretty face

Hurt by love
Hurt by love
I'm just a fool for a pretty face
