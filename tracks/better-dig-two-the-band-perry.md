I told you on the day we wed
I was gonna love you 'til I's dead
Made you wait 'til our wedding night
That's the first and the last time I'll wear white

So if the ties that bind ever do come loose
Tie 'em in a knot like a hangman's noose
Cause I'll go to heaven or I'll go to hell
Before I'll see you with someone else

Put me in the ground
Put me six foot down
And let the stone say,

"Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much."
If you go before I do
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two

Well,
It won't be whiskey, it won't be meth
It'll be your name on my last breath
If divorce or death ever do us part
The coroner will call it a broken heart

So put me in the ground
Put me six foot down
And let the stone say,

"Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much."
If you go before I do
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two

Dig two
Ooh, ooh

I took your name when I took those vows (took those vows)
I meant 'em back then and I mean 'em right now,
Oh, right now

If the ties that bind ever do come loose
If "forever" ever ends for you
If that ring gets a little too tight
You might as well read me my last rites

And let the stone say,

"Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much."
If you go before I do
Gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig, uh!

There'll be a stone right next to mine,
We'll be together 'til the end of time
Don't you go before I do,
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two

I told you on the day we wed
I was gonna love you 'til I's dead
