Keep on dancing
Keep on doin' the jerk
Shake it, shake it, baby

Well, don't you hurry me away
Shake it, shake it till the break of day

Keep on dancin' and a prancin'
Keep on dancin' and a prancin'
Keep on dancin' and a prancin'

Keep on dancing
Keep on doin' the jerk
Shake it, shake it, baby
Come on and show me how you work

Now you're in motion
I'm gonna do the locomotion, yeah
Well, don't you hurry me away
Shake it, shake it till the break of day

Keep on dancin' and a prancin'
Keep on dancin' and a prancin'
Keep on dancin' and a prancin'

All right everybody! We wanna see y'all get up and dance
We wanna see y'all havin' a real good time
And now by popular demand
Keep on dancin', dancin', dancin'

Keep on dancing
Keep on doin' the jerk
Shake it, shake it, baby
Come on and show me how you work

Now you're in motion
I'm gonna do the locomotion, yeah
Well, don't you hurry me away
Shake it, shake it till the break of day

Keep on dancin' and a prancin'
Keep on dancin' and a prancin'
Keep on dancin' and a prancin'
