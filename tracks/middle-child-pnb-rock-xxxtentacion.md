Ohoh-oh
Yeah yeah yeah

Mama had five boys, me, I was the middle child
By the age of 13, bitch, I was young and wild
Caught my first case, then I got kicked out my mama house
Got nowhere to stay, bitch, I'm runnin' in your fuckin' house (Bitch!)
With 'em 30s out (Yeah), fuck you talkin' 'bout? (Yeah)
Yeah, going round the city, that's where I'm lurking out (Lurking out)
Baby I'm high as shit I'm off a Perky now (Perky now)

Huh, nigga run up on me, I'ma blow him down
So much cash, in my jeans, Louis V, pocket wallet
Niggas hate, niggas bitches, niggas bitches pocket watchin'
Uh, now I'm talkin' 'bout no pistol, I'm talkin' 30s now (30s now)
Hey 30s now, 30 bands, 30 now
Pussy nigga always talkin' why the fuck these niggas talkin'
I don't know, pull up slow, sticks out the window, look what you started

Huh yeah, catch an opp better bounce and we go burn him down (Burn him down)
Burn it down, 30 rounds, 30 rounds
Hold up, niggas don't want no smoke
Roll up, dead niggas when I smoke
Bad bitch, she put it all in her throat
She suck my dick while I fuck with a Ghost
New buss down yeah my wrist is on froze
These niggas is hoes I keep me a pole
I swear these new bitches be doin' the most
Slimy like I'm drippin' snot from my nose
You know I came from the mud with this (Mud)
They never showed me no love with this (No love)
I had to jug and finesse, was just standing on corner, was selling them drugs and shit (Drugs)
They used to be on some other shit
Know they see me coming opposite
I tell them leeches to suck a dick
Nowadays they see be doggin' shit

Mama had five boys, me, I was the middle child
By the age of 13, bitch, I was young and wild
Caught my first case, then I got kicked out my mama house
Got nowhere to stay, bitch, I'm runnin' in your fuckin' house (Bitch!)
With 'em 30s out (Yeah), fuck you talkin' 'bout? (Yeah)
Yeah, going round the city, that's where I'm lurking out (Lurking out)
Baby I'm high as shit I'm off a Perky now (Perky now)

Huh, nigga run up on me, I'ma blow him down
So much cash, in my jeans, Louis V, pocket wallet
Niggas hate, niggas bitches, niggas bitches pocket watchin'
Uh, now I'm talkin' 'bout no pistol, I'm talkin' 30s now (30s now)
Hey 30s now, 30 bands, 30 now
