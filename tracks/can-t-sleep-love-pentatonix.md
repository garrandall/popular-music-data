Uh huh
Yeah


Tell me, am I going crazy?
Tell me, have I lost my mind?
Am I just afraid of loving?
Or am I not the loving kind?


Kissing in the moonlight, movies on a late night
Getting old
I've been there, done that
Supposed to be hot but it's just cold
Somebody wake up my heart, light me up
Set fire to my soul, yeah
Cause I can't do it anymore


Gimme that can't sleep love (Gimme that can't sleep)
I want that can't sleep love (Gimme that can't sleep)
The kind I dream about all day
The kind that keeps me up all night
Gimme that can't sleep love


Maybe I'm too picky honey
But I'm not in the world you're in
I'm not in it for the money
I'm here looking for the real thing


Kissin' in the moonlight, movies on a late night
Gettin' old (It's gettin' old!)
I've been there, done that
Supposed to be hot but it's just cold (So, so, so cold!)
Somebody wake up my heart, light me up
Set fire to my soul (to my soul, to my soul, to my soul)
Cause' I can't do it anymore, no


Gimme that can't sleep love (Gimme that can't sleep)
I want that can't sleep love (Gimme that can't sleep)
The kind I dream about all day
The kind that keeps me up all night
Gimme that can't sleep love


I'm tired of dreaming of no one (I'm tired)
I need some body next to mine (I-I'm tired, yeah!)
Cause I'm dyin' to give it to someone (give it to someone)
Because I can't do it anymore


Gimme that can't sleep love (Gimme that can't sleep)
I want that can't sleep love (Gimme that can't sleep)
The kind I dream about all day
The kind that keeps me up all night
Gimme that can't sleep love
