You told me I was the one

The only one who got your head undone
And for a while
I believed the line that you spun
But I've been lookin' at you
Lookin' closely at the things you do
I didn't see you the way you wanted me to
How
How
Howzat?
You messed about

I caught you out

H owzat ?
Now that I've found where you're at

It's good-bye. Well
Howzat?
It's good-bye
You only came for a smile
Even though you're really not my style
I didn't think that you'd run me round like you do
How
How
Howzat?
You messed about

I caught you out

Howzat?
Now that I've found where you're at

It's good-bye. Well
Howzat?
It's good-bye
Oh yeah
Oh
Oh yeah
