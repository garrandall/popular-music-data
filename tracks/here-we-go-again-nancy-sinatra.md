Here we go again
She's back in town again
I'll take her back again
One more time

Here we go again
The phone will ring again
I'll be her fool again
One more time

I've been there before
And I'll try it again
But any fool knows
That there's no way to win

Here we go again
She'll break my heart again
I'll play the part again
One more time

Here we go again
She'll break my heart again
I'll play the part again
One more time

I'll take her back again
One more time, ooh
