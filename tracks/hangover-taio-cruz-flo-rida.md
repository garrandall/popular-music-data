I got a hangover, whoa!
I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, whoa!
I got an empty cup
Pour me some more

So I can go until I blow up, eh
 So I can go until they close up, eh
And I can drink until I throw up, eh
And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it going, ke-keep, keep it going, going, going, going...


I got a little bit trashed last night, night
I got a little bit wasted, yeah yeah
I got a little bit mashed last night, night
I got a little shhh faced it, yeah yeah

Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm on the roof
If you don't know
Well now you know


I got a hangover, whoa!
I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, whoa!
I got an empty cup
Pour me some more

So I can go until I blow up, eh
 So I can go until they close up, eh
And I can drink until I throw up, eh
And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it going, ke-keep, keep it going, come on!


Drink up, 'cause a party ain't a party 'til you ride all through it.
End up on the floor, you can't remember, you clueless.
Officer like what the hell is you doin'
Stumbling, fumbling, you wanna what? Come again?
Give me Henn, give me gin, give me liquor, give me champagne bubbles 'til I'm bent
What happens after that, you inspired, tell a friend
Just like my homie Taio, we can all sip again
Get it and again, and again
Leave evidence
Wasted, so what? Irrelevant.
Beer keg to the head, who selling it?
I got a hangover, that's my medicine
Don't mean to bragg or sound too intelligent
A little Jack can't hurt this veteran
I show up but I never throw up,
So let the drinks go up, pour up


I got a hangover, whoa!
I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, whoa!
I got an empty cup
Pour me some more

So I can go until I blow up, eh
 So I can go until they close up, eh
And I can drink until I throw up, eh
And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it going, ke-keep, keep it going, come on!


I got a hangover, whoa!
I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, whoa!
I got an empty cup
Pour me some more

So I can go until I blow up, eh
 So I can go until they close up, eh
And I can drink until I throw up, eh
And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it going, ke-keep, keep it going, come on!
