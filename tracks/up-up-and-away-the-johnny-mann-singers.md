Would you like to ride
In my beautiful balloon
Would you like to glide
In my beautiful balloon

We could float among
The stars together, you and I
For we can fly, we can fly

Up, up and away
In my beautiful
My beautiful balloon

The world's a nicer place
In my beautiful balloon
It wears a nicer face
In my beautiful balloon

We can sing a song
And sail along the silver sky
For we can fly, we can fly

Up, up and away
In my beautiful
My beautiful balloon

Suspended under
The twilight canopy
We'll search the clouds
For a star to guide us

If by some chance
You find yourself loving me
We'll find a cloud to hide us
We'll keep the moon beside us

Love is waiting there
In my beautiful balloon
Way up in the air
In my beautiful balloon

If you'll hold my hand
We'll chase your dream
Across the sky
For we can fly, we can fly

Up, up and away
In my beautiful
My beautiful balloon
Balloon, up, up, and away
