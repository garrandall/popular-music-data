Livin' is dyin'
'Cause love you've left me cryin'
Now there's no use tryin' to go on

Each night I dream baby, pretendin'
There'll be a happy endin'
Burnin' down deep inside
Got a heartbreak that I can't hide
(Down inside, deep down inside)

I'm not The Proud One, I need you
I'm beggin' to you baby, please
You're The Proud One, believe me
This poor man is down on his knees

Baby, please

Oh baby, remember
The love we shared so tender
Hoping that forever you'd me mine

I wish you could hear me, oh baby
If only you were near me
I didn't know what I had
Don't ya know that I feel so bad
(Didn't know, I didn't know)

I'm not The Proud One, I need you
I'm beggin' to you baby, please
You're The Proud One, believe me
This poor man is down on his knees

I'm not The Proud One, I need you
I'm beggin' to you baby, please
You're The Proud One, believe me
This poor man is down on his knees

I'm not The Proud One, I need you
I'm beggin' to you baby, please
You're The Proud One, believe me
This poor man is down on his knees
