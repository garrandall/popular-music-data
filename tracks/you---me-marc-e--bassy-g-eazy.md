Roll with killers all day
Smoking killa' all day
Smooth us all day
And the radio sounds like the bay

Like it you like it
Girl don't try it, fight it
Like it, you like it
You might as well try it

Roll with killers all day
Smoking killa' all day
Smooth us all day
And the radio sounds like the bay

Show you how, show you how
Show you how, show you how
Show you how, show you how
Show you how this works
If you knew better
You might do better


I know that you think your bad enough
And tell me you don't need to fall in love
But I ain't the one thats to call your bluff
Ooo yeah I don't need your
No, I don't need your

Now itâs four forty-five
Write songs, getting high
Yikin' that thot
Addicted to the life

Like it you like it
You like it you like it
Girl don't try it, fight it
Like it, you like it
You might as well try it

I'm a show you how, show you how
Show you how, show you how
Show you how, show you how
Show you how this works
If you knew better
You might do better


I knew that you think your bad enough
I think that your bad enough
Don't need to fall in love
But I ain't the one that to call your bluff
I don't need your
I don't need your


Ugh, let me show you how this goes
5am marble floors on your tip toes
Pour two drinks then we sip those
Up all night Like a 70's disco's, then I switch flows
Tell me what you trying to get into
I am only in town for one night
So it's simple and you saw that text I sent you
Unless it's something we shouldn't do
Take it somewhere we ain't took it too
You could tell how I look at you
I'mma end up fucking you

Thats five in the morn'
Feel like all alone
Pictures in my phone
Saw that I am taking it home

I like it so, why try and deny it?
I like it, I like it
I could never fight it
I could show you how
Show you how
