Oh, it's merciless the grind
Sometimes we turn to crime
But the sun will always shine, yeah
It's merciless the grind
Sometimes we turn to crime
But the sun will always shine, yeah

Oh father, father can you hear?
Can you hear your children crying? Can you see their tears?
To feed the ones you hold so dear
Somebody dying, and no survive, story of my life right, hey
Look at me, really look at me
Heart of a champion, eyes that have seen
Murder on my street, death on my block
Cops that be more criminal than cop
Daddy a kingpin, mama a hustler
What am I gonna be? Who is it up to?
Me and just me, doing it my way
'Til I see sunrays, hey

The sun will always shine, sun will always shine
Sun will always shine on me
So even if it's crime, I'm taking care of mine
The sun will always shine on me, shine on me


I see 1 shot, 2 shot, 3 shot, 4
Daddy I can't take no more
I'm sick of watching windows 'fore I walk out the door
I know that's not what I'm here for, it's a brighter day
These bars sit with the Lord, he know my story
I'm a tell it all and live large before I'm 40
Frank Gathers, this your daughter, everybody know
I could light this spliff but everybody blow it
The impact, I did that
I'm a take this and sit back
And watch the chips that you digged at
We started from the bottom, you gotta know the sun is always shining


The sun will always shine, sun will always shine
Sun will always shine on me
So even if it's crime, I'm taking care of mine
The sun will always shine on me, shine on me


Sun will always shine on me, yeah, sun will always shine on me
It's merciless the grind, sometimes you turn to crime
But you gotta keep your head up
Don't look down, don't ever give up
Cause the sun gon' shine through any weather
It's merciless the grind, sometimes you turn to crime
But baby keep your head up
Don't look down, don't ever give up
Cause the sun gon' shine through any weather


So even if it's crime, I'm taking care of mine
So the sun will always shine on me, shine on me
The sun will always shine, sun will always shine
Sun will always shine on me
So even if it's crime, I'm taking care of mine
The sun will always shine on me, shine on me
