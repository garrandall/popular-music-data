Ain't shady baby
I'm hot like the prodigal son
Pick a petal, eeny meeny miny mo
And, flower, you're the chosen one

Well, your left hand's free
And your right's in grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun
Oh, no

I tackle, we tussle
And oh my days we're rolling
My right hand's gripped on his 
Colt single-action army 
Oh, no

Well, your left hand's free
And your right's in grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun 
Oh, no

N-E-O OMG
Gee whiz, girl, you're the one for me
Though your man is bigger than I am
All my days he disagrees
Oh, no

Speak easy

Well, my left hand's free 
Oh, no

Ain't shady baby
I'm hot like the prodigal son
Pick a petal, eeny meeny miny mo
And, flower, you're the chosen one

Well, your left hand's free
Well, my left hand's free 
Oh, no
