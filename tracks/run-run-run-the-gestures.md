Now run run baby
Run run run to set you free
Run run run run baby
Run run run run baby run
I'll just set you free

Now did you know
That I didn't love you
And did you know
I'd make a fool of you

Run run run run baby
Run run run run baby run

There I was all alone
Waiting for you to phone
But you were out with another guy
Why oh why oh why

Run run baby
Run run run to set you free
Run run run run baby
Run run run run baby run
I'll just set you free

There I was all alone
Waiting for you to phone
But you were out with another guy
Why oh why oh why

Come on and run run baby
Run run run to set you free
Run run run run baby
Run run run run baby
Run run run run baby run
