Someone just like me
Runnin' into someone just like you
An accidental touch
Turned into a gentle kiss or two
Love has finally come
Somehow found my someone


Close to you, that's how I feel
When the world's asleep and we're sharin' sweet
Solitude, almost gave up
Trying to find someone else in love

Long walk, soft talk
Still can't believe it, what were the odds of




Was that me? Not long ago
No one here to care
No one's dreams to share
You agree, nights can be rough
When you can't find someone else in love

Long walk, soft talk
Hard to believe it, what were the odds of

You and me, all alone
That's my favorite time of night
Nothing for us to do
But finding ways to hold each other tight

Imagine
