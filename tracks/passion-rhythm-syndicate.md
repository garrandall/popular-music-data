Sitting in my bedroom the rain is pouring down
The shade is on the window and loneliness is all around
A little voice I'm hearing says don't you stay inside
But I can't fight this feeling got L.U.S.T. on my mind

I head for the arena where lovers try their fate
Moving through the darkness I take my place and wait
A pretty bird beside me says hello with her eyes
She looks so sweet and lovely but is she N.A.S.T.Y?

CHORUS
P.A.S.S.I.O.N.
Got me in a jam again
There's no way that I can win
P.A.S.S.I.O.N.

Her lips are callin to me no way I can resist
Addicted to the feeling intoxicated by her kiss
I take her to my castle we set our bodies free
And while the music played on she loved me down from A to Z

The night is getting longer I start to realise
Don't know what I've got into the girl is C.R.A.Z.Y.
I try to cool the fire like I oughta should
But there's no way to turn back the S.E.X. is just too good

Chorus

Don't be tempted to touch the fire
I shouldve read all the warning signs
You might get burned by your own desire
I lost my mind I must have been blind

I never knew another lover that was evil under cover
Then I discovered you girl, you're like no other
Doin the time for the crime I was blind
To the games that you were playin
Words that you were sayin
Goin out of my mind, you're like a hurricane
Drive me insane you're like a heart attack
Know it's a fact, you got the knack to drop a man to his knees

Chorus
