We had a love, a kind of love that was so rare
And every day you'd find some way to show me you cared
And in the darkest night when things weren't goin' right
You could turn my night into day?
When rain would start to fall I could hear you call
And the clouds would all blow away?

And it breaks my heart to know that you're gone
Oh, yes, it breaks my heart to know you're never, never coming home
To know you're never, never coming home?
To know you're never, never coming home?
To know you're never, never coming home?

I remember when I fell and I could tell you felt the same
You used to say that one fine day you'd wear my name
I dunno what went wrong I woke and you were gone
Now I don't get along like before now you've left me blue

You found someone new and I can't call on you anymore

And it breaks my heart to know that you're gone
Oh, yes, it breaks my heart to know you're never, never coming home
To know you're never, never coming home?
To know you're never, never coming home?
To know you're never, never coming home?

And it breaks my heart to know that you're gone
Oh, yes, it breaks my heart to know you're never, never coming home
To know you're never, never coming home?
To know you're never, never coming home?
To know you're never, never coming home?
