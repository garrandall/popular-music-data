There's a feeling deep inside me
That I never felt before
And I feel it when I see you
And when I touch you
I feel it even more

And I wonder when I'm with you
Do you feel the way I do
When you put your arms around me
Do you get that feeling too

Can you feel it deep inside
Can you feel it in your heart
Can you feel it deep inside
If you feel it, then we can start

Put our heart together
And there's not a thing to feel
If you've got that loving feeling
Then the time for us is here

So just take a look around you
And then tell me what you see
Is the world a little brighter
And does the sun just seem
To shine for you and me
