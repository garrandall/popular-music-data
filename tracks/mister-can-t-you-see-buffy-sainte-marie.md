I can hear the rivers flowing
And I can see the winds blowing
Since the endless marching of the time

And if you don't know what I'm feeling
Take a look 'cause I'm revealing
Everything that's now
Running through my mind

I'm telling you the time is coming
You're gonna have to start
Your poor legs running
Out of this old world
You refuse to call your own

Hard it's coming and it may be tomorrow
You're gonna have to beg and to borrow
Sanity from a man you've never known

And if you don't know what I'm feeling
Take a look 'cause I'm revealing
Everything that's now
Running through my mind

And I can see the rivers flowing
I can hear the wind blowing
Since the endless marching of the time

Mirrors come from every angle
I'm telling you
You're gonna have to dangle
Your mind from a living while
You're gonna think so small

I swear the day is coming, coming soon
The truth is gonna bust a lot of balloons
There's gonna be a lot of people
Learning to crawl

And if you don't know what I'm feeling
Take a look 'cause I'm revealing
Everything that's now
Running through my mind

And I can see the rivers flowing
I can hear the wind blowing
Since the endless marching of the time
