It donât matter what plans I got, I can break âem.
Yeah, I can turn this thing around at the next red light
And I donât mind telling all the guys I canât meet âem.
Hell, we can all go raise some hell on any other night

Girl, I donât care. Oh I just gotta see what youâre wearing.
Your hair, is it pulled up or falling down?
Oh I just have to see it now.


If you wanna call me, call me, call me.
You donât have to worry âbout it baby.
You can wake me up in the dead of the night;
Wreck my plans, baby thatâs alright.
This is a drop everything kind of thing.
Swing on by I'll pour you a drink.
The doorâs unlocked. Iâll leave on the lights
Baby you can crash my party anytime.

Ainât a spot downtown thatâs rockinâ the way that you rock me.
Ainât a bar that can make me buzz the way that you do.
I could be on the front row of the best show.
And look down and see your face on my phone.
And Iâm gone so long, hang on. Iâll meet you in a minute or two.



If itâs 2 in the morning
And youâre feeling lonely
And wondering what Iâm doing...


Go ahead and call me, call me, call me
You donât have to worry âbout it baby.
You can wake me up in the dead of the night;
Wreck my plans, baby thatâs alright.
This is a drop everything kind of thing.
Swing on by I'll pour you a drink.
The doorâs unlocked. Iâll leave on the lights
Baby you can crash my party anytime.

(Call me, call me, call me)

Baby you can crash my party anytime.
