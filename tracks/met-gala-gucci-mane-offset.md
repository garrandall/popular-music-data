Hey
Southside
Wizop
Offset
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
Woo

Mil' in a week (hey)
I bought a iced out Philippe (ice)
Yeah, playin' for keeps (keeps)
Suck the dick game, she a leech (leech)
Came in the game with a key (key)
My pockets blew up, Monique (Monique)
Oh, she got that perfect physique (oh)
I'll tape a brick to her cheeks (brick)
Now that I'm gettin' this money
I'm fuckin' these thotties, they tryna get commas (come up)
This is good week, we stackin' up Ms
And I'm snatchin' that Wraith in the mornin' (Wraith)
I was that nigga locked up in the cell
And they treated me like I was normal (normal)
Thankin' the Lord for them blessings
I just left the Met Gala dressin' up formal (formal)

Look at my boogers, they big as you (booger)
You could get shot with your nigga too (bow)
This stick make a nigga do boogaloo (brr)
Bentley Mulsanne but the seats masseuse (skrt)
I'm havin' more stripes than Adidas boots (havin' that)
Dick in her mouth like I'm edible (dickin' that)
Nigga stop shootin', you better move (brr)
I fight for my gang, I won't let 'em lose (gang)
Your bitch, she wantin' the pipe, aight
This shit started off likes (huh)
Hopped in my DM and rode me a kite, flight (yeah)
And she on the very first flight (go)
Finesse a nigga then get this shit right (huh)
On sight, right, nigga, goodnight (on sight)
Poppin' that shit 'cause he thinkin' he pipe, pipe
Hunnid rounds drum with the knife (brr)
Me and the Wop, Biggie and Pac (Wop)
But we so different, we keepin' the Glock (bow)
I'm on a yacht and a yacht on my watch (yacht)
Fuckin' a thot on the ocean, Dubai (thot)
I'ma play dumb but that's see out the plot (plot)
She know what I'm 'bout (hey)
You hear this dope and your heart gonna stop (hey)
They callin' the cops (12)
Hop on the jet, this a 20 passenger (jet)
Offset the mania, I'm the massacre (hey)
I take your heart out and shoot your bladder up (agh)
Get to the top and we blew the ladder up (top)
Ran up my money and I'm talkin' lateral (bag)
Had that bitch high off a Perc and Adderall (high)
Pull out the fire and you better grab it all (brrr)
Bitch, I'm Offset and I'm 'bout to set it off (hey, hey)

Mil' in a week (hey)
I bought a iced out Philippe (ice)
Yeah, playin' for keeps (keeps)
Suck up the gang, she a leech (leech)
Came in the game with a key (key)
My pockets blew up, Monique (Monique)
Oh, she got that perfect physique (oh)
I tape a brick to her cheeks (brick)
Now that I'm gettin' this money
I'm fuckin' these thotties, they tryna get come up (come up)
This is good week, we stackin' up Ms
And I'm snatchin' that Wraith in the mornin' (Wraith)
I was that nigga locked up in the cell
And they treated me like I was normal (normal)
Thankin' the Lord for them blessings
I just let the met gala dressin' up formal (formal)


I'm havin' this shit what you hadn't (havin' it)
Showin' respect like your daddy (respect)
Yeah, Gucci the man, cash in the caddy (guwop)
I just woke up in a palace (woo)
I did a walk through, I'm in Dallas, man (walk through)
Flew in two bitches from Cali (pew)
These Bs on me, I can't barely (B)
They drunk and they just walkin' barely
I'm headed to Paris to pick up a bag (go, go, go)
And they treat me like one of the Jacksons
These niggas ain't trippin', they makin' transactions (nah)
A nigga rob you, you be practicing (bow)
Four bitches all tryna swallow this
I feel like I'm fightin' an octopus (woo)
Thought it was killers, camped out in my bushes (brr)
Then come to find out it's photographers (flash)
Feds watch me through binoculars (feds)
Mad 'cause a nigga get popular (grr)
Flex on a hoe wanna lock me up, yo (flex)
Drop Top Wop but the top is up (skrt, skrt)
Negative turn to a positive (woo, woo, woo)
I don't care for no obstacles
I could care less 'bout the bloggers, boy (no)
80K stuffed in my joggers, boy (80 boy)


Mil' in a week (hey)
I bought a iced out Philippe (ice)
Yeah, playin' for keeps (keeps)
Suck the dick game, she a leech (leech)

Now that I'm gettin' this money
I'm fuckin' these thotties, they tryna get come up (come up)
This is good weed, we stackin' up Ms
And I'm snatchin' that Wraith in the mornin' (Wraith)
I was that nigga locked up in the cell
And they treated me like I was normal (normal)
Thankin' the Lord for them blessings
I just left the met gala dress up formal (formal)
