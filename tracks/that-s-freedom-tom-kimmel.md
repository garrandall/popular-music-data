I don't know what you want from me
Or what you think a love ought to be
I want something that's open and strong
As the country this road's moving on

I want something as wild and free
As the rain that swells the streams in springtime
I want something, you understand
To hold in my heart, not in my hand

Chorus
From the mountain to the valley
From the ocean to the alley
From the highway to the river
One emotion to deliver
One heart, one way, one love
To share but not to chain
That's freedom

It's the song of the heart
It's a place in the mind, a light in the dark
That's freedom
It's a reason to live and after the rain
Rekindle the spark
That's freedom
It's a measure of trust
When love is alive it's tender and tough
It's all love is about, this opening up
And letting it out
Let freedom ring

I don't know why it takes so long
To remember what the world's doing wrong
Never wanted to shove my plan on another
Who can't understand

All I want is a fast lane to
Where the road across this plain won't take you
I want something, you understand
To make us stand proud like nothing else can

Repeat Chorus
