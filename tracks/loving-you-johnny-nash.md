Take away the autumn leaves
Take away the summer breeze
But don't take away, don't take away your love
Take away the moonlit'skies
Take the sunshine from my eyes
But don't take away, don't take away your love
Let me touch your lips and know the thrill of all your charms
Then I'll hold the world, the very world within my arms

Take away the kiss of spring
Take away my everything
But don't take away, don't take away your love
No, no, no, don't take away, don't take away your love

I'm begging you, please, don't take away your love

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, darling don't take away your love
Aw, just let me touch your lips and know the thrill of all your charms
Then I'll hold the world, the very world within my arms

Take away the kiss of spring
Take away my everything
But don't take away, don't take away your love
Don't take away, don't take away your love
No, no, no, no, no, no, don't take away your love
