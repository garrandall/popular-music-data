Who knows where your love goes
When he closed the door
We have understanding and that means much more
But I don't have to worry where he goes
'Cause I know that he'll be coming home
You better give up or you'll never win
You better give up hanging on to him
Can't you see
Oh no you're just

Dreamin' dreamin' of him
You're just dreamin' dreamin' of him
You're just dreamin' while he's dreamin' of me
Just dreamin' dreamin' of love you wish you had

I see magic in your eyes when he walks by
But I know you wanna touch him
Honey don't you try
'Cause you don't stand a snowball chance in hell
You'll make up trying to undream of him

Dreamin' dreamin' of him
You're just dreamin' dreamin' of him
You're just dreamin' while he's dreamin' of me
Just dreamin' dreamin' of love you wish you had

Oh you're just gonna spend a lonely night
Dreamin' while he's dreamin' of me you're dreamin' of
Love you wish you had
Dreamin' while he's dreamin' of me
Dreamin' all the time he's dreamin' of me
You wish you had You wish you had
You better give up or you'll never win
You better give up hanging on to him
Can't you see
You wish you had
You wish you had

I know you want my baby
You see I know I got a good thing
Yes I do
You see girls this man is not like other men
And the reason I say this
Is because I know every lady out
There feel the same thing
Every lady feels that her man is special
He's special to her
No matter how he looks baby

It's the inside that counts
It's what's up front that counts
I'm gonna tell it to you anyway
So called best girlfriends
You know the kind laugh in your face and try to take
Your man
Behind your back
You know what I'm talking about
You know where I'm coming from
Well let me tell you something
Let me tell you something
I don't play around girls like that
You know I don't really like to socialize with them
Because I feel like this
What's mine is mine
What's yours is yours
You see I don't want nothing that's yours
I don't want nothing that looks at you
You see I know I got mine
I know I got him
I got every part of him
I got him from his hair to the tip of his toe
I know what I got
But let me tell you this
You see when you got somebody that loves you
You know they love
You can stand up here like me and tell the whole wide
World
That I got my man
That I got my man

Stand up and tell everybody I got him
I can stand up and tell everybody I got him
Everybody say I got him
I like to hear you know
Ain't gonna let nobody take him from me
Oh ain't gonna let nobody take him from me
I know how to love him
How to squeeze him how to tease him
