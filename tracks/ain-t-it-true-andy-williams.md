Ain't it true
No matter what you do
Someday when life is through
They're gonna bury you
Beneath the cold, cold ground, girl

Big or small
Or short or fat or tall
It's gonna get us all
Someday we're gonna fall
Beneath the cold, cold ground, girl

So you best believe it
No matter what you do
Yes, you best believe it
Ain't it true, ain't it true
Ain't it true

My poor heart
Was almost torn apart
Because you played a part
You thought that you were smart
And now you're gone
Gone, gone, girl

All your life
You treated me so bad
You took the love I had
And left me feeling sad
But I'll go on, on, on, girl

Cause I know that someday
Your time will be due
Yes, you'd best believe it
Ain't it true, ain't it true
Ain't it true

I don't want to be the one
To see you in such misery
Not even for the things
You went and done, done, done, girl

There is time for
You to change your mind
And leave your cheating heart behind
And turn the righteous kind
Come back to me, girl

And I will forgive you
Here's what I'll say
On that final day
They lay you away
There was never another like you

Ain't it true, girl
Ain't it true, girl

And I will forgive you
Here's what I'll say
On that final day
They lay you away
There was never another like you

Ain't it true, girl
Ain't it true, girl
