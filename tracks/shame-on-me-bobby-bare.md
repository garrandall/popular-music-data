Shame on me for hurting you
What can I say, what can I do?
Last night I was blind but today I see
I did you wrong, shame on me.

You say you won't be seein' me again
You say we're through
I wouldn't want to see the sunrise tomorrow
If I knew that to be true.

I know that just sayin' sorry
Doesn't sound out a lot
But the girl you saw me with last night
Means no more to me.

Than the thousand stars
To the great clouds that cover the night
The more I look at her
The more I realize how much I love you.

Shame on me for hurting you
What can I say, what can I do?
Last night I was blind but today I see
I did you wrong, shame on me.

I'll admit I shouldn't have
Given into love's wild temptation
With someone I cared nothing for
I was blind and I hurt you.

Can you ever forgive the fool
The fool who really loves you?
Last night I was blind but today I see
I did you wrong, shame on me...
