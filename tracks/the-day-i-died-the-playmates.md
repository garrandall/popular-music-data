(Wah)
(Wah)
Oh I dreamed the jukebox played the day I died (wah)
And a million rock and rollers softly cried (wah)
And they all dropped shiny dimes in my coffin
Remembering the times which were often
They rock and rolled to a big big record of mine (wah)

Oh I dreamed the day I died a jukebox played (wah)
And upon my chest a golden record lay (wah)
They was a-stompin' and a-strollin'
There was a-goin' on
All the cats were wailin'
The gonest is gone

Oh I dreamed the jukebox played the day I died (wah)
And while I lay in state, I could'a flipped my lid
Do you know what I dreamed the jockeys went and did?
They bought up all my records in each and every town
They played them simultaneously (one more song!)

I dreamed the jukebox played the day I died (wah)
And a million rock and rollers softly cried (wah)
And while a-stompin' and a-strollin'
There was a-goin' on
All the cats were wailin'
The gonest is gone

Oh I dreamed the jukebox played the day I died (wah)
And while I lay in state, I could'a flipped my lid
Do you know what I dreamed the jockeys went and did?
They bought up all my records in each and every town
They played them simultaneously (one more song!)

I dreamed a jukebox played the day I died (wah)
And a million rock and rollers softly cried (wah)
And while a-stompin' and a-strollin'
There was a-goin' on
All the cats were wailin'
The gonest is gone

I dreamed the jukebox played the day I died (wah)
Oh I dreamed the jukebox played the day I died (wah)
Oh I dreamed the jukebox played the day I died
