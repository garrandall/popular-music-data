Lip stick junkie
Debunked the all in one, she
Came back wearing a smile
Lookin' like someone drugged me
That wanted to unplug me
No one here is on trial
It's just a turnaround
And we go, oh
And then we go oh oh oh oh

Tick tock I want to 
Rock you like the 80s
Cock blockin' isn't allowed
Tugboat Sheila 
Is into memorabilia
Who said three is a crowd
We better get it on the go


Hey now
We've got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud

I said hey now
We've got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
She knows how to make it loud


Rain dance Maggie
Advances to the final
Who knew that she had the goods
Little did I know her body 
Was warm delicious vinyl
To your neck of the woods
I want to lick a little bit


Hey now
We've got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud


You've got the wrong girl
But not for long girl
It's in the song girl
'Cause I'll be gone girl


Hey now
We've got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud

I said hey now
I want to rock this rowdy crowd
She told me to
And showed me what to do
She knows how to make it loud


But not for long girl
It's in the song girl
'Cause I'll be gone 'bye 'bye 'bye yeah
'Bye 'bye 'bye girl



'Bye 'bye girl
'Bye 'bye girl
'Bye 'bye
