Don't take your love from me
Don't take your love, baby
Ohhh. (Don't take your love from me.)
Don't you ever take it away, baby
Hm, mmm, mmm
(Don't take your love from me.) No, no, no, no

I really don't think I can make it, baby
Girl, if you ever go away
I can't take it, baby, no, no, no
Girl, I build my whole life around you
Never go, never say that we're through
Baby, all I want in life is you, me and you
Me and you

(Don't take your love from me.)
Ohhh, don't you, don't ever take it away, baby, no, no, no
(Don't take your love from me.)
Oh, I got to have your love by my side, baby, baby
(Don't take your love from me.)
Oh, don't you ever take it away, darling, darling

Girl, if you really turn my whole life around
If I see you, baby
My love comes tumbling down
There's no words to express how I feel
You made all of my dreams become real
And together, I know we can feel a love so strong
So strong

(Don't take your love from me.)
Oh, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my baby
Hey. (Don't take your love from me.)
Don't you ever, don't you ever take your love from me
I got to have it
(Don't take your love from me.) I need it
Oh, baby, baby, baby

Look at here, will you just sit down for a minute?
I'm going to turn this light down
What I'm going to ask you, it won't take long
You see, I didn't listen to Mama
Daddy didn't tell me what to do
My sister says I'm crazy
My brother, ha, just laughs at me
All my friends say that I'm a fool
Baby, I feel like I can't have a life if I can't have it with you
I know I couldn't adjust to any other life
Baby, please don't take your love from me
I know a man ain't supposed to cry
Baby, if you leave me, I swear I don't know what I'll do
Please don't take your love from me

Ohhh. (Don't take your love from me.)
Don't you, don't you, don't you take it from me, baby
(Don't take your love from me.)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I got to, I got to have it, baby
(Don't take your love from me.) Yeah, yeah, yeah
