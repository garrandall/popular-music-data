Baby, I know you've got to go
I have no right
To tell you not to go

The road just isn't there for us
There never was a prayer for us
You know how much I want you now
I don't wanna stay here
Give you fits and haunt your mind
And for now, baby
Since you're free to choose again
It's your life to win or lose again

But, hey, just don't forget about me, now, baby
Baby, please, just don't forget about me, now, baby
Today I cannot borrow
A minute of your tomorrow
Don't let it cause you sorrow
Come on baby, please
Just don't forget about me, now, baby
Just don't forget about me

Ah, someday, our paths may cross again
Baby, then we'll find the kind of love
We've lost again
But for now, I've got to let you go
It's ourselves we've got to get to know

Ah, no, don't forget about me, now, baby
Oh, please, don't forget about me, now, baby
Today I cannot borrow
One minute of your tomorrow
Don't let it cause you sorrow
Got to be baby, baby
I want you now
