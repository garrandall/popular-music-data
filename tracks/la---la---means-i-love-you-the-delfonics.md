Many guys have come to you
With a line that wasn't true
And you passed them by
Are you in the center ring
And their lines don't mean a thing
Why don't you let me try
No, I don't wear a diamond ring
I don't even know a song to sing

All I know is la-la la-la la-la la-la la means I love you
Oh, baby, please, now
La-la la-la la-la la-la la means I love you

If I ever saw a girl
That I needed in this world
You are the one for me
Let me hold you in my arms
Girl, and thrill you with my charms
I'm sure you will see
The things I am sayin' are true
And the way I explain them to you
Listen to me

La-la la-la la-la la-la la means I love you
Oh, baby please now
La-la la-la la-la la-la la means I love you
Oh, yeah, yeah

The things I am sayin' are true
And the way I explain them to you
Yes, to you
Listen to me
La-la la-la la-la la-la la means I love you

Oh, you got to understand now
La-la la-la la-la la-la la means I love you
Oh, come on and take my hand now
La-la la-la la-la la-la la means I love you
Come on, and be my only one now
