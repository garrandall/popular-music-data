Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Wish you didn't have to go, baby
Wish you didn't have to rush
Let's not call it a night now, baby
I'm still hungry for your touch

Let's not be practical baby
Let's forget that it's time to go
You can tell your mother, baby
That you went to a late, late show

Wish you didn't have to go, baby
Wish you didn't have to rush
Let's not call it a night now, baby
I'm still hungry for your touch

We just can't stop now, baby
Your kisses done got me this strong, yeah
Oh, and it fills up my need now, baby
You can't interrupt a world of joy

Wish you didn't have to go, baby
Wish you didn't have to rush
Let's not call it a night now, baby
I'm still hungry for your touch

You say your mother will be so mad
She might keep you home for a week
So I guess I better take you home
Or I'll go home and lose a week of sleep

Wish you didn't have to go, baby
Wish you didn't have to rush
(Etc to fade)
