I'mma tell y'all sucka ass niggas somethin'..
First of all nigga, look'a here dawg..


You mighta seen me in the streets but nigga, you don't know me
When you holla when you speak, remember you don't know me
Save all the hatin' and the plottin', nigga you don't know me
Quit tellin' niggas you my partna, nigga you don't know me
Don't be a groupie, keep it movin', nigga you don't know me
Hey I ain't trippin' pimp, the truth is really, you don't know me
Yeah, you know they call me T.I., but you don't know me
You be hatin' and I see why, cuz you don't know me


I think it's time I made a song for niggas who don't know me
I graduated out the streets, I'mma real O.G
I been trappin', shootin' pistols since I stood four feet
So all you niggas actin' bad, you gon have to show me
You gon make me bring this Chevy to a real slow creep
My niggas hangin' out the window, mouth fulla gold teeth
When the guns start poppin' wonder when it's gone cease
Chopper hit you in' the side an' create a slow leak
We can end the speculation cuz today we gone see
What's the future of a pussy nigga hatin' on me
I give a fuck about the FED's investigation on me
I don't care that they at my shows and they waitin' on me
I'mma keep on flossin', poppin' long as Toomp is on the beat
Tell police's I ain't stoppin', I'mma keep it in the streets
Contrary to yo beliefs, I'm as real as you can be
Fuck yo thoughts and yo feelings, nigga you don't know me


You mighta seen me in the streets but nigga, you don't know me
When you holla when you speak, remember you don't know me
Save all the hatin' and the plottin', nigga you don't know me
Quit tellin' niggas you my partna, nigga you don't know me
Don't be a groupie, keep it movin', nigga you don't know me
Hey I ain't trippin' pimp, the truth is really, you don't know me
Yeah, you know they call me T.I., but you don't know me
You be hatin' and I see why, cuz you don't know me


Ay, once again let me remind you nigga, you don't know me
So don't be walkin' up and askin' what's the deal on a key
I don't know if you wearin' wires, you could be the police
If I was slangin' blow you couldn't get a O-Z
See me and the P.$.C. fallin' through at a show deep
Police holdin' up the door, cuz they know we tote heat
I just wanna ride wit C, blow dro' in the Fleet
Or with Clay and bout a dozen different bitches in a week
I just wanna chill wit Kuntry and his daddy Freddie G
Ballin' out at anytime, in any store we spend a G
Wanna ball in the Bahamas, courtesy of K.T
Mac Boney got a mil, as well as Dolla D.P
A.K. house on the hill right next to J.G
Every week meet at Philant's restaurant and eat free
Get Inda paid, lil' Greg and B
That's the only shot we got at gettin' cap back on the streets


You mighta seen me in the streets but nigga, you don't know me
When you holla when you speak, remember you don't know me
Save all the hatin' and the plottin', nigga you don't know me
Quit tellin' niggas you my partna, nigga you don't know me
Don't be a groupie, keep it movin', nigga you don't know me
Hey I ain't trippin' pimp, the truth is really, you don't know me
Yeah, you know they call me T.I., but you don't know me
You be hatin' and I see why, cuz you don't know me


You see a nigga hatin' on a G, ask'em what it's gon be
Whachu lookin' at? Pussy nigga, you don't know me
At the club, in the streets, or wherever we should meet
It's choppas choppin', pistols poppin', nigga you don't know me
Ay, you see a nigga hatin' on a G, ask'em what it's gonna be
Whachu lookin' at? Pussy nigga, you don't know me
At the club, in the streets, or wherever we should meet
It's choppas choppin', pistols poppin', nigga you don't know me


You mighta seen me in the streets but nigga, you don't know me
When you holla when you speak, remember you don't know me
Save all the hatin' and the plottin', nigga you don't know me
Quit tellin' niggas you my partna, nigga you don't know me
Don't be a groupie, keep it movin', nigga you don't know me
Hey I ain't trippin' pimp, the truth is really, you don't know me
Yeah, you know they call me T.I., but you don't know me
You be hatin' and I see why, cuz you don't know me
