Don't try to explain your mind
I know what's happening here
One minute it's love and suddenly
It's like a battlefield
One word turns into a war
Why is it the smallest things that tear us down
My world's nothing when you're gone
I'm out here without a shield
Can't go back now

Both hands tied behind my back for nothing, oh, no
These times when we climb so fast to fall again
Why we gotta fall for it now

I never meant to start a war
You know I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know what we're fighting for

Why does love always feel like
a battlefield (battlefield)
a battlefield (battlefield)
a battlefield (battlefield)

Why does love always feel like

Can't swallow our pride,
Neither of us wanna raise that flag
If we can't surrender
then we both gonna lose what we had, oh no

Both hands tied behind my back for nothing (nothing)
Oh no, these times when we climb so fast to fall again
I don't wanna fall for it now

I never meant to start a war
You know I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know what we're fighting for

Why does love always feel like
a battlefield (battlefield)
a battlefield (battlefield)
a battlefield (battlefield)


I guess you better go and get your armor
(get your armor)
Get your armor (get your armor)
I guess you better go and get your armor
(get your armor)
Get your armor (get your armor)
I guess you better go and get your

We could pretend that we are friends tonight
And in the morning we'll wake up and we'll be alright
Cause baby we don't have to fight
And I don't want this love to feel like

A battlefield (oh), a battlefield (oh), a battlefield,
Why does love always feel like a battlefield (oh),
A battlefield (oh), a battlefield

I guess you better go and get your armor
I never meant to start a war (start a war)
You know I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know what we're fighting for
(fighting, fighting for)

Why does love always feel like
a battlefield (battlefield)
a battlefield (battlefield)
a battlefield (battlefield)


I guess you better go and get your armor
(get your armor)
Get your armor (get your armor)
I guess you better go and get your armor
(get your armor)
Get your armor (get your armor)


Why does love always feel like
(whoa ooow)
Why does love always feel like
(whoa ooow)
A battlefield, a battlefield..


I never meant to start a war
Don't even know what we're fighting for
I never meant to start a war
Don't even know what we're fighting for
(whoa ooow)
