With my eyes wide open I'm dreaming
Can it be true I'm holding you close to my heart?
With my eyes wide open I'm dreaming
You're with me now sharing a vow never to part

I'm so afraid to close my eyes
Afraid that I'll find
This lovely thrill
Is just a silly illusion

With my eyes wide open I'm dreaming
Do I deserve such a break?
Pinch me to prove I'm awake

I can't believe that you're really mine

MONOLOGUE: Darlin' with my eyes wide open I'm dreamin'! Can it be true that I'm holdin' you so close to my heart? Ya know with my eyes wide open I'm dreamin'! You're here with me now make the vow that we'd never part. I'm so afraid to close my eyes! I'm afraid that I'll wake and find that all this dreamin' is just a silly illusion!

With my eyes wide open I'm dreaming
Do I deserve such a break?
Pinch me to prove I'm awake
I can't believe that you're really mine
