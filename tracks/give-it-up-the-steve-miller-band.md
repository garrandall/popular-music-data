Your good loving is what I need
Good loving is what I need
Oh, a little bit of love and some affection
Keep me moving in the right direction
Good loving is what I need


So come on give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it up, give it up
Come on darling give it up
Give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it up, give it up
Come on darling give it up


A little bit of love and some affection
Keep me moving in the right direction
So give it up, give it up
Come on darling give me your love


I am so in love with you
Baby, it's true
Come on darling, we got to be smart
Come on darling, don't play with a heart
Give it up, give it up, come on darling give me your love
Hey, hey baby
Don't do me this way
No, no
Hey, darling
Don't do me this way




So come on give it up, give it up
Come on darling give me your love
Oh, oh give it up, give it up
Come on darling give me your love




So come on give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it up, give it up
Come on darling give it up
Give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it up, give it up
Come on darling give it up
