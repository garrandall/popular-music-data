Lookie here baby
What I say is right
You know I'm gonna love you baby
I'm gonna love you twice

I can't stand up
Baby, you're mine

You know your sweet lovin' baby
Is better than some wine
You know your sweet lovin' baby
Takes all my time

Stay here
Don't leave momma
Know I love you so
Hey, pretty baby
I don't wanna ever see you go
Tell you now momma
I ain't talking no jive
Hey pretty baby
You make me feel good to be alive
Oh-oh, baby you're my woman now

Oh, hey hey hey hey, hey-yeah baby
Honey, you know I mean it right now

One thing momma
That really stays on my mind
The way you cook my food
And you give it to me on time
One thing baby I'm gonna sure always try to do
And never make you blue
Ooh, baby, baby  you're fine
Yeah, yeah

Hey, hey momma, woo!
Hey, hey baby you know you're mine

When I get up in the morning baby
Take the cab to the plane
Take the plane baby to you know where I'm gonna play
I'll never forget you momma
You're with me every day
And when I get lonely baby, what can I say
Some day  on my baby
Been trying to take some rest

Hey, yeah, baby, I swear
Look, girl, you know you the best


That's right
Oh yeah
Hmm, mmh-mmh-mmh
Oh
Oh,  baby
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh!

Hey, hey, yeah baby
You make me wanna say, wow!
Everybody say wow!

You know what, big momma?
I can't lose with the step I use
Can't lose baby 'cause I sure got you
One thing I wanna tell ya
You know you got me
I'd rather 
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa...
Hey-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh babe, I love your soul
