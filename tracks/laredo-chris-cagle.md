You've always been a friend of mine
And that's the way we'll be 'til the day I die
It's good to know you're on my side
'Cause now you know she's leaving me
And I need your help to make her see
So turn on your charm and let it shine
'Cause you've always been the one
Who could make her stay around
So when she gets to the city limit sign
Don't let me down

Oh Laredo, don't let her go
Just take by the heart
And let the wheels turn slow
Oh Laredo, you're my only hope
So get her back to the day we met
'Cause that's as far as she needs to get
But please don't let her go
Oh Laredo

Make her think about the moonlit walks
And the long, long talks by the waters edge
With her feet hanging off the Cane Creek Bridge
And bring to mind the first kiss we shared
At the old town square when she drives down there
'Cause that's a day she said she could never forget
Keep the nights by the candlelight
As an ace in the hole
'Cause those are nights of passion
That I know will bring her home

Oh Laredo, don't let her go
Just take by the heart
And let the wheels turn slow
Oh Laredo, you're my only hope
So get her back to the day we met
'Cause that's as far as she needs to get
But please don't let her go
Oh Laredo
Oh Laredo, don't let her go
Just take by the heart
And let the wheels turn slow
Oh Laredo, you're my only hope
So get her back to the day we met
'Cause that's as far as she needs to get
But please don't let her go
Oh Laredo
