Don't hold back
If it feels good, do it
Don't hold back

Don't hold back
If it feels good
Don't hold back


If you want to shout
And dance all around
Don't hold back

Said if you want to party
Party, party, party
Don't hold back


Don't hold back
If it feels good, do it
Don't hold back

Don't hold back
If it feels good
Don't hold back


If you want to change your mind
And it feels good, do it
Don't hold back

And if the music makes you move
Stand up, do the groove
Don't hold back


Don't hold back
If it feels good, do it
Don't hold back


Don't hold back
If it feels good
Don't hold back


Don't hold back
If it feels good, do it
Don't hold back


Don't hold back
If it feels good
Don't hold back


Don't hold back
If it feels good, do it
Don't hold back
[Don't hold back
Don't hold back, baby, yeah]

Don't hold back
If it feels good
Don't hold back


Don't hold back
If it feels good, do it
Don't hold back
Don't hold back
Don't hold back

Don't hold back
If it feels good
Don't hold back

Baby, don't hold back
If it feels good, do it
Don't hold back

Don't hold back
If it feels...
