Mama's got a squeeze box
She wears on her chest
And when Daddy comes home
He never gets no rest

Cause she's playing all night
And the music's alright
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night

Well the kids don't eat
And the dog can't sleep
There's no escape from the music
In the whole damn street

Cause she's playing all night
And the music's alright
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night

She goes in and out and in and out
And in and out and in and out
She's playin' all night and the music's all right
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night

She goes, squeeze me, come on and squeeze me
Come on and tease me like you do
I'm so in love with you
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night

She goes in and out and in and out
And in and out and in and out
Well, she's playing all night
And the music's alright
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night
