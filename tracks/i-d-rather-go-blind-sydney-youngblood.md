Something told me it was over
When I saw you and her talking
Something deep down in my soul said cry girl
When I saw you and that girl walking

I would rather
I would rather go blind, boy
Than to see you walk away from me, child
So you see, I love you so much
That I don't wanna watch you leave me, baby
Most of all I just don't
I just don't want to be free, no

I was just, I was just
I was just sitting here thinking
Of your kiss and your warm embrace
When the reflection in the glass that I held to my lips, baby
Revealed the tears that was on my face

And
Baby, Baby, I'd rather be blind, boy
Than to see you walk away from me
