Baby you're laughin'
But I'll be around for a while yeah, yeah, yeah
Can't you dig it, honey
While watching my style now, alright
Oh yeah

So many ways that one can play
Do the shing-a-ling or the funky broadway
Too too sad, and it ain't no joke
Different strokes for different folks, now

Mama stroke, papa too
A stroke for me and a stroke for you
Ah yeah
Stroke for a woman, stroke for a man
Stroke for the honey, Ah yeah
Stroke for the game, now
Too too sad, and it ain't no joke
Different strokes for different folks, now
Awww yeah

Watch me do the stroke one time, baby
Watch me do the stroke two times now lady
I wanna do my stroke three times now
Let me do my stroke four times mama
Alright now, watch me
Let me do my stroke baby
Come on mama
