Oh yeah

Do you love me just a little, honey? 
Oh yeah (oh yeah, ooh, ooh) 
My uncertain heart has to know, oh, oh (oh, oh) 
Tell me now (tell me now, tell me now) 
Before I let myself go, boy (let myself go) 
Do you love me? (Do you, do you, do you love me?) 
I've gotta know, oh 
Honey, honey, honey 
Honey, honey, honey, oh honey

Oh... do you care a little for me, sweetheart? 
Uh-huh (oh yeah, ooh, ooh) 
Or do you plan for us to part? Oh yeah 
Tell me now (tell me now) 
Baby, baby before it's too late, girl (before it's too late) 
Oh, should I, should I go, mama? 
Or should I stay? Oh 
Honey, honey, honey 
Honey, honey, honey, oh honey

Oh love, oh love can be a many splendid thing 
Oh what joy, what joy true love can bring 
Oh, and because I want, oh 
I really want a love that's real (want a love that's real) 
Oh honey, I just got to know, oh, just how you feel 
Oh, tell me, baby

Tell me, tell me, tell me should I get ready for a heartbreak? 
Oh yeah, oh yeah 
Or tell me what I saw if I had to wait, yeah 
Tell me now (tell me now, tell me now) 
Oh, am I loving you in vain? (loving you in vain) 
Oh, and if I love you too much more, honey 
Well, I have nothing to gain 
Oh, tell me now 
Honey, honey, honey 
Honey, honey, honey, honey

I declare I love you 
I wanna know do you love me, too, honey 
Hey, hey, hey 
I declare I love you 
I wanna know do you love me, too, honey 
Ooh, hey.. baby, baby 
I declare I love you 
I wanna know do you love me, too, honey
