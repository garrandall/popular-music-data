When the wind blows through your hair
I want you so bad, want you so bad
I see your smile boy everywhere
I want you so bad, want you so bad
I never thought this could happen to me
If I've fallen over you
Would it be so bad, would it be so bad
Every night's an eternity
I want you so bad, want you so bad
I never thought this could happen to me
I want you so bad, bad
When the wind blows through your hair
I want you so bad, want you so bad
Oh I wonder if you're aware
I want you so bad
I wonder if you care
I never thought this would happen to me
I want you so bad, bad
I want you so bad
I want you so bad
I want you so bad
