You better leave my kitten all alone
You better leave my kitten all alone
I done told you, big fat bulldog
You better leave her alone

Don't you know
My kitten is a dream
Don't you know
My kitten is a dream
So get your hands off of her
Cause I'm her loving man

Mr. Dog, I'm gonna hit you
On the top of your head
The fat girl's gonna miss you
And you'll wish that you were dead

If you don't leave my kitten all alone
Yes, I love my little kitten
Like you hound dogs love your bone

Mr. Dog, I'm gonna hit you
On the top of your head
The fat girl's gonna miss you
And you'll wish that you were dead

If you don't leave my kitten all alone
Yes, I love my little kitten
Like all you hound dogs
Love your bone, oh, yeah

You better leave
You better leave
You better leave
