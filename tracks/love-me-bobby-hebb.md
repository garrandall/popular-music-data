Love me
That's all I want you to do
Just as long as your love
For me is true

Want me, baby
Just like a baby boy wants a toy
I'll be your pride and joy
Come on, baby, and love me

Need me, oh, just like I need you
It ain't hard to do as long as you
Really, really love me

Come on, love me
No matter if I'm up or down
No greater love can be found
Come on, darling, shucks
And love me

Just want me, want me
With all your heart and soul
Our love will never grow old
Baby, not if you really want me

Birds will sing
The sun is gonna shine
Don't you know
Happiness, we'll find, oh
When you say you are mine

Love me, oh
That's all I want you to do
Just as long as your love
For me is true, oh baby

Well, I'm gonna
Come on and love me, love me
Wrap your arms around me
Around me

Come on, baby, squeeze me
Tease me, please me, baby
Squeeze me, yeah, baby
