Hello, baby
Yes, it's really me
After all the wrong I've done
I guess you're surprised to see me

Here at your door
Like a sparrow with a broken wing
Who's come back to beg you
Oh, reconsider me

Oh, please reconsider me
I can't make it
Without your love
Can't you see

So, let me, just let me
Love you eternally
Oh, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Reconsider me

I learned the truth
About the so-called good life
It was just a candle too short to burn the night

Now, here in the darkness in my heart
Don't you know I bring to you in plea
Oh, light my way again
Light my way again
And, girl, reconsider me

Oh, please reconsider me
I can't make it
I can't make it
Without you, girl
Can't you see

So, just love me
Love me
Let me love you eternally
Oh, baby, baby, oh, baby
Reconsider me

If you got any feelings for me
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, oh, baby
