Looking back over the years that I've known
If I had made this journey alone
I'd be searching for meaning so empty inside
If not for the love of Christ

I could pretend that I'm satisfied
Make you believe that I'm enjoying the ride
But the smile on my face would be a disguise
If not for the love of Christ

The love of Christ oh the love of Christ
No finer treasure no greater prize
I can't imagine living my life
If not for the love of Christ

No mercy to cover all my mistakes
There'd be no peace through my darkest days
And no hope that I'd ever see paradise
If not for the love of Christ
