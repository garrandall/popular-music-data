So fine, so fine, so fine, yeah
My baby's so doggone fine
And she loves me, come rain, come shine
Woh-oh, yeah, so fine

She thrills me, she thrills me, she thrills me, yeah
My baby thrills me all the time
She sends cold chills up and down my spine
Woh-oh, yeah, so fine

Well, I know, I know she loves me so
Well, I know, I know because my baby tells me so-woh-woh
So fine, so fine, so fine, yeah
My baby's so doggone fine
She sends cold chills up and down my spine
Woh-oh, yeah, so fine
