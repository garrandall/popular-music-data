Just because she feeds me well
and she made me talk dirty in a pink hotel
doesn't mean she's got eyes for me
she might just want my bones you see
hey flathead don't you get mean
she's the second best killer that I have ever seen
they don't come much more sick than you
I could go on if you want me to
it's just so wrong so very nice I told you
once and you killed me twice
I saw you one time at the back of the
club chewing on glass and a ticket stub
I heard they kicked the boy till he bled
then stood and said oh my god till she said
bara bap bara ra ra bara bap bara ra ra ra...
everybody knows you're the one to call
when the girls get ugly at the back of the wall
Josephine says you got a bleeding nose
so taking it with her wherever she goes
hey flathead don't check me in
well hers is a tonic and mine is a gin
they don't come much more slick
than you I'd drive your car if you ask me to
said the boy's not right in the head
so he stood and got a kicking instead till she said
bara bap bara ra ra bara bap bara ra ra ra...

And she said the boy's not right in the head
And you stood and said oh my god till she said
bara bap bara ra ra bara bap bara ra ra ra...
