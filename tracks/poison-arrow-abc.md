If I were to say to you, "can you keep a secret?"
Would you know just what to do or where to keep it?
Then I say, "I love you", foul the situation
Hey girl, I thought we were the right combination

Who broke my heart, you did, you did
Bow to the target, blame Cupid, Cupid
You think you're smart, stupid, stupid

Shoot that poison arrow to my heart
Shoot that poison arrow
Shoot that poison arrow to my heart
Shoot that poison arrow

No rhythm in cymbals, no tempo in drums
Love on arrival, she comes when she comes
Right on the target but wide of the mark
What I thought was fire was only the spark

The sweetest melody is an unheard refrain
So lower your sights, yeah
But raise your aim, raise your aim

Who broke my heart, you did, you did
Bow to the target, blame Cupid, Cupid
You think you're smart, stupid, stupid

Shoot that poison arrow to my heart
Shoot that poison arrow
Shoot that poison arrow to my heart
Shoot that poison arrow

I thought you loved me, but it seems you don't care
 I care enough to know I can never love you

Who broke my heart, you did, you did
Bow to the target, blame Cupid
You think you're smart, that's stupid
Right from the start when you knew we would part

Shoot that poison arrow to my heart
Shoot that poison arrow
Shoot that poison arrow to my heart, heart, heart
Shoot that poison arrow

Heart, shoot that poison arrow
Shoot that poison arrow
