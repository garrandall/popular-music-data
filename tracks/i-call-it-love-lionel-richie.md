I look at you
You look at me
(You can't tell me you ain't feeling butterflies)
It's obvious
We have some chemistry
(I think I know it because it feels so right)
Girl I wanted so long to know
Now you're telling me you gotta let it go
(Don't tell me I have to start all over again)
I never thought that this day would come
(This is something that I've wanted in my life)
I realize that you're the one
(And you're telling me its time to say goodbye)
What's inside of my heart it ain't going to change
So it shouldn't be so easy to walk away
(You feel it, I feel it, let's not pretend)


Baby, I don't know what love Is
Maybe I'm a fool
I just know what I'm Feeling
And it's all because of you
Don't tell me
I don't know
I want the truth
Because they call it
We call it
You call it
I call it love


It's so clear for you to see
(Don't let anybody tell you what to do)
Why they can't they just let us be happy
(I don't want to find somebody new)
If you know whats really in your heart
Then don't let them tear us apart
(Because you feel it, I feel it
Let's think this through)


Baby, I don't know what love Is
Maybe I'm a fool
I just know what I'm Feeling
And it's all because of you (please don't go)
Don't tell me
I don't know
I want the truth
Because they call it
We call it
You call it
I call it love


We have a bond that's unbreakable
And it's not time to let it go (don't let it go)
And now that we know it's real
We are going to let it show
To the whole world
That I'm yours forever
And you're my girl (you're my girl)
You might live with me, oh oh
I don't know


Baby, I don't know what love Is
Maybe I'm a fool (Maybe I'm a fool)
I just know what I'm Feeling
And it's all because of you (it's all because of you)
Don't tell me
I don't know
I want the truth (I want you)
Because they call it
We call it
You call it
I call it love
Baby, I don't know what love Is
Maybe I'm a fool
I just know what I'm Feeling
And it's all because of you
Don't tell me
I don't know
I want the truth
Because they call it
We call it
You call it
I call it love


Love
They call it love
I call it
Love
