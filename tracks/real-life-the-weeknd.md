Tell 'em this boy wasn't meant for lovin'
Tell 'em this heart doesn't stay to one
I'll be the same, never changed for nothin'
It's all I know, never learned much more


Mama called me destructive, oh yeah
Said it'd ruin me one day, yeah
Cause every woman that loved me, oh yeah
I seemed to push them away


That's real life, oh oh oh
Real life, ooh
Mama talking that real life, oh oh oh
That real life, real life, real life, real life


I know you don't really understand it
I'm not allowed to regret my choice
I heard that love is a risk worth taking
I wouldn't know, never been that boy


Mama called me destructive, oh yeah
Said it'd ruin me one day, yeah
Cause every woman that loved me, oh yeah
I seemed to push them away


That's real life, oh oh oh
Real life, ooh
Mama talking that real life, oh oh oh
That real life, real life, real life, real life


Heaven only lets a few in
(Heaven only lets a few in)
It's too late for me to choose it
(It's too late for me to choose it)
Don't waste precious tears on me, I'm not worth the misery
I'm better off when I'm alone


That's real life, oh oh oh
Real life, ooh
Mama talking that real life, oh oh oh
That real life, real life, real life, real life
That's real life, oh oh oh
Real life, ooh
Mama talking that real life, oh oh oh (ooh mama!)
Yeah, yeah, real life, real life, real life, real life
