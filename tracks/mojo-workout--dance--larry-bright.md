I got my mojo working
Well, my mojo working
Well, my mojo working
Well, my mojo working

I'm a mojo wrecking body
Just won't work on you

You grab your little girl
And you spin her around
You grab both hands
And you holler out loud

You turn and your turn
Til you're back to back
You move your feet and
Then you don't look back

You do the mojo workout
Well, the mojo workout
You do the mojo workout
Til you just can't wait no more

Shuffle right and back
And you hold on tight
A bopping and a hopping
From left to right

You snap your fingers
And turn all around
You do a little chicken
Then you holler out loud

You do the mojo workout
Aww, work out now, mm hm
Yeah,? was never like this

There's one more thing
That you've gotta learn to do
Stomp and you romp
And you do the goochie-goo

You wiggle and you turn
And away you go
That's the way you do the mojo

You do the mojo workout
I mean the mojo workout
You do the mojo workout
Til you just can't wait no more

Yeah, the mojo workout
My mojo's working
My mojo's working
Baby, my mojo's working
