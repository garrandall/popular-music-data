Ready to fall in love!
And now you're giving me a

Guess loving you was a waste of time

Never mind what I've been through
If you should go what am I to do?
Remember we met and the Foom was crowded
And I can't forget the way that I found it
Giving it all
Ready to fall in love!
And now you're giving me a

Heartache
Huh Huh Huh Huh Huh
It's a fools game
It's a shame shame
I can feel the heartache
Its a fool game
Its a fool game
Shame shame
Oh it's a heartache
And I feel the pain
Huh Huh Huh Huh Huh
Heartache
Its a heartache
Fools game fools game
Shame shame
I can't take it
I can feel feel feel the heartache
It's a fools game
Shame shame
