Kiss me each morning for a million years
Hold me each evening by your side
Tell me you'll love me for a million years
Then if it don't work out, then if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye

Sweeten my coffee with a morning kiss
Soften my dreams with your sighs
Tell me you'll love me for a million years
Then if it don't work out, then if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye

If you must go, oh no, I won't grieve
If you wait a lifetime before you leave

Then if you must go, I won't tell you, no
Just so that we can say we tried
Tell me you'll love me for a million years
Then if it don't work out, then if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye
