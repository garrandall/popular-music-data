There, there was a time I knew
That no matter, come what may, love
Would prevail
And then inside the dreams I knew
Came the question lovers fear
Can true love fail
Then I would miss the childhood wish
And haven't I sung to you
Of the knight in armor bright
Faithful and true to you


Darling, after all
I will be the one to hold you in my arms
After all
I will be the one to hold you
I will be the one to hold you in my arms
In my arms

I know in my heart and mind
That no matter, come what may, love will survive
And love, the author of space and time
Keeps the galaxies and each sparrow alive
And the love that heals the wound
After the war is through
Is the knight in armor bright
Faithful and true to you
