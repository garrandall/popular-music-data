I'm writing this letter
To say good-bye
I know it will hurt you
Yes you will cry
Baby, baby
Won't you forgive me
I know I am wrong
I kept pretending
And leading you on

I'm writing this letter
With the tears in my eyes
Well now I've been thinking
I made you cry
Baby, baby
Throw in our picture
Darling forgive me
I read your lies
But darling you let me
