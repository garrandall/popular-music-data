Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
And you're the key to my piece of mind


'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
(Woman)


When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for
And if I make you happy, I don't need to do more


'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
(Woman)


Oh baby, what you've done to me (What you've done to me)
You made me feel so good inside (Good inside)
And I just wanna be (Wanna be)
Close to you, you make me feel so alive


You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
(Woman)
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
(Woman)
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
