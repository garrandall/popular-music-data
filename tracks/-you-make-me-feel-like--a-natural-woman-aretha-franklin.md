Looking out in the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you, life was so unkind
And you're the key to my peace of mind

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)

And when my soul was in the lost and found
Oh, you came along to claim it
And I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for
And if I make you happy
Baby, I don't need to do more

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)

Oh, baby, what you've done to me (what you've done to me)
Ooh, you make me feel so good inside (good inside)
And I, oh, I just want to be (I just want to be) close to you
You make me feel so alive

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)
Yeah, you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
Woman...
