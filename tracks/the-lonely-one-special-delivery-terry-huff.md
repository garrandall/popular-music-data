Another day has passed away,
As I watch the old, old, old, old setting sun
Couldn't help but think of you out there somewhere
Probably having so much fun
Here I sit all alone, the, the lonely one
That's what they call
The Lonely One do

Hey, I watched your ship as it sailed,
Couldn't feel anything,
Oh, I was so numb.
Couldn't quite figure out just where I failed
It's left me feeling kind of down, oh yes it has
Empty shell now that your gone
I'm just the lonely one

And every day I watch for you
Lonely, yes, I do
And every night I say a prayer,
A prayer or two
If someone gave me a penny for each thought
I'd, I'd be a rich millionaire, yes, I would
For all I do, do is sit here thinking of you

I'm just the lonely one
Hey, Ooh, Oh yeah, Oh, Baby,
The lonely one, the lonely one, the lonely one
Oh Baby, Oh Baby, Oh Baby, Oh Baby
