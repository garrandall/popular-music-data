Hula hoop, hula hoop, anyone can play the hula hoop
Hula hoop, hula hoop, anyone can play from three to a hundred and ten
Hoop-hoop hoop-hoop
Hoop-hoop hoop-hoop

From LA to New York, from Georgia to Duluth
Everyone is playing with the hula hoop
Ared ones and the green ones, yellow, white, and blue

Young and old, rich or poor, are spinning them, too

Hula hoop, hula hoop, everyone is playin with the hula hoop
Look at them spin, trying to win
Anyone can play from three to a hundred and ten
Hoop-hoop hoop-hoop
Hoop-hoop hoop-hoop

Oh, what fun to see them run and to see them play
Tryin to keep the hula hoop from, ah, slippin away
Now if they flop when they should sway, it would fall to the ground
Then again, once again, the hoop spins around
And round

Hula hoop, hula hoop, everyone is playin with the hula hoop
Look at them spin, trying to win
Anyone can play from three to a hundred and ten
Hoop-hoop hoop-hoop
Hoop-hoop hoop-hoop

Hula hoop, hula hoop, everyone is playin with the hula hoop
Look at them spin, trying to win
Anyone can play from three to a hundred and ten
Hoop-hoop hoop-hoop

Hoop-hoop hoop-hoop
