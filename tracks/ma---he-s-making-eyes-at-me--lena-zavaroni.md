Ma!
Ma, he's making eyes at me
Ma, he's awfully nice to me
Ma, he's almost breaking my heart

He's beside me
Mercy!
Let my conscience guide me!
Ma, he wants to marry me
Oh, be my honey bee

Every minute he gets bolder
Now he's leaning on my shoulder
Ma, he's kissing me

Ma, he's making eyes at me
Ma, he's awfully nice to me
Ma, he's almost breakin' my heart

He's beside me
Mercy!
Let my conscience guide me!
Ma, he wants to marry me
Be my honey bee

Every minute he gets bolder
Now he's leaning on my shoulder
Ma, he's kissing me
Ma, he's kissing me
