You couldn't break me in the end... (oh no) 
And such a freedom I enjoy 
When you're deaf to the sounds you trust 
If that was all you've got, my friend... (oh no) 
Then set yourself to disappoint 
Yeah... 

Feels like I'm strapped down on this table... so tight
You've got me stuck to a razor's edge 
And I'm trapped in a deadbolt glove 
You stand to cut me or enable... oh no 
And such a streak starts steading heads
And I live for the things I love 

Sad, but maybe it's true 
Push you back's what I'll do 
And it's just enough 
To keep you back one second longer 

Take a little more than what I've got 
It's all I have to please you 
Break a little piece of what you want 
Bite back the hand that feeds you 

Remember when things seem so stable... you know that 
I compromise just to appease 
Yeah, you take but you take too much 
If what you need's not seeming able... yeah, right 
Then maybe it works when I leave 
Yeah, you fake what you say you love 

Sad, but maybe it's true 
Push you back's what I'll do 
And it's just enough 
To keep you back one second longer 

Take a little more than what I've got 
It's all I have to please you 
Break a little piece of what you want 
Bite back the hand that feeds you 

Take a little more than what I've got 
It's all I have to please you 
Break a little piece of what you want 
Bite back the hand that feeds you 

Move faster 
I can't move enough 
How much longer? 
Is this long enough? 
We can't be 
And it won't even catch your attention 
And it pains me so to mention 

Sad, but maybe it's true 
Push you back's what I'll do 
And it's just enough 
To keep you back one second longer 

Take a little more than what I've got 
It's all I have to please you 
Break a little piece of what you want 
Bite back the hand that feeds you 

Take a little more than what I've got 
It's all I have to please you 
Break a little piece of what you want 
Bite back the hand that feeds you 

Take what I've got 
It's all I have to please you 
Break what you want 
Bite back the hand that feeds you 

Take what I've got 
It's all I have to please you 
Break what you want 
Bite back the hand that feeds you
