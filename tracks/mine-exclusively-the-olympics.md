Like a sweet thing
You're on to my love
Baby I'm going to share you
Baby said with no one

I love to feel your lips
Pressed to close to mine
Your tender kiss sends chills
Up and down my spine

You're mine exclusively
You're mine exclusively

Sweet thing
Baby you're my love
Don't you know
I'm going to share you
With no one

You know that your embrace
You know sets mys oul on fire
The way you tease me
And tell a line
Fill me with desire

You're mine exclusively
You're mine exclusively

Baby Sweet thing
Baby you're my love
Don't you know
I'm going to share you
Little girl my baby With no one

Listen
I'll never let you go
You've been so good to me
You're special way of loving baby
Makes my life complete
You're mine exclusively
You're mine exclusively

Baby Sweet thing
Baby you're my love
I'm going to share you
Little girl my baby With no one

Sweet thing
Baby you're my love
I'm going to share you
Little girl my baby With no one

Sweet thing
I'm so glad that you're my love
