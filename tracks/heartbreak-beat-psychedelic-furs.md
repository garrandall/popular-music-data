I'm a heartbreak beat
Yeah, all night long
And nobody don't dance on the edge of the dark
We've got the radio on
And it feels like love
But it don't mean a lot
And it feels like love
And it's all that we've got

There's a heartbreak beat playin' all night long
Down on my street
And it feels like love got the radio on
And it's all that we need
There's a heartbreak beat
And it feels like love
There's a heartbreak beat
And it feels like love

Well the beat don't stop
We talk so tough
And there's a perfect kiss, somewhere out in the dark
But a kiss ain't enough
And the world don't stop
Every time that you call
And the world don't stop
Every time that you fall

There's a heartbreak beat playin' all night long
Down on my street
And it feels like love got the radio on
And it's all that we need
There's a heartbreak beat
And it feels like love
There's a heartbreak beat
And it feels like love

I'm a heartbreak beat
Yeah, all night long
And nobody don't dance on the edge of the dark
We've got the radio on
And it feels like love
But it don't mean a lot
And it feels like love
And it's all that we've got

There's a heartbreak beat playin' all night long
Down on my street
And it feels like love got the radio on
And it's all that we need
There's a heartbreak beat
And it feels like love
There's a heartbreak beat
And it feels like love

There's a heartbreak beat
I'm a heartbreak beat
I'm a heartbreak beat
I'm a heartbreak beat
