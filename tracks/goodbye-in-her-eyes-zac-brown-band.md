I could tell that it was over
When her lips met mine
It was an emptiness in her voice
Hesitation when she smiled
She didn't have to say a word
It was just so plain to see
She had found what she'd been looking for
And I knew it wasn't me

I saw goodbye in her eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it

Sometimes I feel like a clown
Who can't wash off his make-up
The life she wanted, it was gone
Prince Charming, I wasn't
But I would trade a thousand Babylons
To be in her arms tomorrow
But like the tide her love has come and gone
And it's time for me to go

I saw goodbye in her eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it
Now she sees right through me
Should I hold on to what we've got
Is it just a waste of time?
One thing that I know for sure
I saw goodbye in her eyes
I saw goodbye in her eyes

I know you got somebody new now
All my candles have burned out
He's gonna love the way you shine
So did I
So don't smile at me if it ain't what you need

(Goodbye)
With that goodbye in your eyes
I know that I can't change it (Now you see right through me)
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it
I saw goodbye in your eyes
I know that I can't change it (Now you see right through me)
Should I hold on (Goodbye in your eyes)
We will never make it (Now you see right through me)
Should I hold on (Goodbye in your eyes)
Is it just a waste of time?
One thing that I know for sure
I saw goodbye in your eyes
I saw goodbye in your eyes
I know that it's over
