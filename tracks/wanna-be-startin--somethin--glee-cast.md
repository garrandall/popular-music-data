I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
Too high to get over ( Yeah, Yeah)
You're too low to get under ( Yeah, Yeah)
You're stuck in the middle ( Yeah, Yeah)
And the pain is thunder ( Yeah, Yeah)
Too high to get over ( Yeah, Yeah)
You're too low to get under ( Yeah, Yeah)
You're stuck in the middle ( Yeah, Yeah)
And the pain is thunder ( Yeah, Yeah)


I took my baby to the doctor
With a fever but nothing he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown!
( Ah) Someone's always trying, to start my baby crying
( Ah) Talkin', squealin', lyin'
Sayin' You just wanna be startin' somethin'


I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
But you got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
But you got to be startin' somethin'
Too high to get over ( Yeah, Yeah)
You're too low to get under ( Yeah, Yeah)
You're stuck in the middle ( Yeah, Yeah)
And the pain is thunder ( Yeah, Yeah)
Too high to get over ( Yeah, Yeah)
You're too low to get under ( Yeah, Yeah)
You're stuck in the middle ( Yeah, Yeah)
And the pain is thunder ( Yeah, Yeah)


You're A Vegetable ( You're A Vegetable)
You're A Vegetable ( You're A Vegetable)
Still They Hate You ( Still They Hate You)
You're A Vegetable ( You're A Vegetable)
You're Just A Buffet ( You're Just A Buffet)
You're A Vegetable ( You're A Vegetable)
They Eat Off Of You ( They Eat Off Of You)
You're A Vegetable ( You're A Vegetable)


Lift your head up high
And scream out to the world!
I know I am someone
And let the truth unfold!
No one can hurt you now
Because you know it's true
Yes, I believe in me
So you believe in you!
Help Me Sing It!

Ma ma se, ma ma se ma ma coo sa!
Ma ma se, ma ma se ma ma coo sa!
Ma ma se, ma ma se ma ma coo sa!
Ma ma se, ma ma se ma ma coo sa!

Help Me Sing It!
