I'm from another country, an alien nation
It's in another world of my own creation
I'm light years away, and nobody's trying to reach me
Despite what I say, nobody knows what I mean

(Chorus)
Turn your radar, radar, radar, radar on
Turn on your radar, radar, radar
I don't want to be alone...

I'd like to get the feeling that someone knew me
But everywhere I go they seem to see right through me
They don't want to hear...How can I get them to listen?
Is it clear....oh I want someone to love

(chorus-solo)
Like an object in space...Does anyone know who I am?

(chorus repeat)
