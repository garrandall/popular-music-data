Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now

Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now

Baby, tonight I need you
And I feel it when I see you
Wherever you wanna go
Whenever, baby, I'm yours

Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now

Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now

'Cause all we got is right now

So close I can taste you
Ain't scared I can take you
Can't fight the feeling
Got me fiending
You got me fiending

Something you wanted to do all your life
There's no more waiting: tonight is the night
And it can't be wrong, not if it feels this right
Turn it up, scream it loud, yeah.

Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now

Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now

'Cause all we got is right now
