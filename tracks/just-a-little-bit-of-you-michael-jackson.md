Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away


I told my mama how I feel about your power
Your love can heal, no doctor's remedy
Ever do what you do for me


Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Eeny weeny teeny bit of your love
Baby it is all I need, it is all I need


Since the day I have been loving you
I cannot catch a cold, I cannot catch the flu
The sweet loving you have been giving me
Has become my daily need


Just a little of your love, every day
It is all I need, that is all I need
Just a little bit baby
That is all I need, that is all I need


So do not send no doctor to my door
Because Doctor John has been here before
Do not you send him, just come yourself
Bring your love and nothing else


Ooh just a, just a
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
