Daytime, night time
Anything I say anytime of day and she's mine
There's no doubt about it
She can't do without my love each and every day

She looks good, feels good
Walkin' down the street everyone we meet says we should
Go a long long way
We should always stay in love each and every day

Got a feelin' goin' for each other yeah
I could never leave her for another girl
Always miles away, we're in another world
And I love her, yes I love her

Daytime, night time
Anything I say anytime of day and she's mine
There's no doubt about
She can't do without my love each and every day

Got a feelin' goin' for each other yeah
I could never leave her for another girl
Always miles away, we're in another world
And I love her, yes I love her

Daytime, night time
Anything I say anytime of day and she's mine
You know she looks good, yeah, she feels good
Walkin' down the street everyone we meet says we should

In the daytime, night time
Oh she looks good and she feels good
Oh daytime, night time
Each and every daytime, night time,
Oh looks good... mmmmmm, she feels good
Ohhhh in the daytime, the night time
Looks good...
(Fade out)
