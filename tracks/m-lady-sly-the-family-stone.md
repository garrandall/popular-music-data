 MLady, MLady
MLady, MLady

 A smile of pleasure, beautiful and kind

 A pretty face, a pretty face
Oh what a gorgeous mind

 Sees me when I, hey, 	
Give her some attention
Just thought I'd mention that

 Give her some time (time, time)

 Give her some time (time, time)

 Give her some time (time, time)

 MLady, MLady
MLady, MLady

 Hoo now now, hoo now
Hoo now now yeah yeah yeah

 MLady, MLady
MLady, MLady
