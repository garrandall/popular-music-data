As the morning casts a thousand bits of sunlight
And they shine like diamonds on the morning dew
I believe that every single one is mine alone to see
And I believe I'm gonna love you

If it seems that there are special stars for lovers
And we see them scattered 'cross midnight blue
I believe that out of all this world, there meant for you and me
I believe I'm gonna love you

I'll take you to a magic place where no one's ever been
Where there's carpets made of flowers, and music in the wind
If you wonder why I'm giving you these treasures
Because you're like no one else I ever knew
I believe that as we walk through time, the best is yet to come
As I believe I'm gonna love you
As I believe I'm gonna love you
