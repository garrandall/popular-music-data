You ready?
Woo! Here we go

Life is just a party so come as you are
Dress it up or dress it down never forget your guitar, yeah
Just be courageous
This style's contagious
Everyone can rock out like a superstar

Let's get crazy!
Get up and dance
Take a swing, do your thing
It's worth taking a chance
Let's get crazy!
Yeah, just kick up your heels
On the south, time to shout
Always keeping it real
Let's get crazy! (crazy!) (crazy)

Our songs, our style, our hair, our smile
Our laughs, our hearts, our grace, our smarts

You see me on the cover of a magazine (remember)
Things are always different then the way that they seem, ha
It's an invitation, to every nation
Meet me on the dance floor and we'll make the scene

Let's get crazy!
Get up and dance
Take a swing, do your thing
It's worth taking a chance
Let's get crazy!
Yeah, just kick up your heels
On the south, time to shout
Always keeping it real
Let's get crazy! (crazy!) (crazy) (crazy)

La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
Oh, oh, oh

Our songs, our style, our hair, our smile
Our laughs, our hearts, our grace, our smarts

Let's get crazy!
Get up and dance
Take a swing, do your thing
It's worth taking a chance
Let's get crazy! (crazy)
Turn the music up loud
Now's the time, to unwind
Get yourself in the crowd
Let's get crazy! (crazy)

Feel the fun, just begun
Come on dance everyone
(Let's get crazy!)
It's an invitation
To every nation

Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah

(Let's get crazy!) Crazy!
(Get up and dance)
Take a swing, do your thing
It's worth taking a chance
Let's get crazy!
Yeah, just kick up your heels
Don't miss out, time to shout
Always keeping it real
Let's get crazy!
