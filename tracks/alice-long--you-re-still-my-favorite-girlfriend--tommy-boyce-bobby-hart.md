Alice Long
You're still my favorite girlfriend
Alicew Long
And I don't forget about you
When you're gone
Even though right now you feel you don't belong
You're still my favorite girlfriend
Alice Long
We both agreed that to get along
To talk things over as they come up
So if you think we don't see each other enough
Then let's talk it over
When we're together
Nothing can keep us apart
But if I ever forget to
But whatever
You're still a part of my heart
Can't you see
Can't you see
Oh you're still my favorite girlfriend
Alice Long
But you can't hold on to love by holding on
When I am with you girl or when I'm gone
Just remember
You're still my favorite girlfriend
Alice Alice Alice Alice Alice Alice
You're still my favorite girlfriend
Alice Long
And I don't forget about you
When you're gone
Even though right now you feel you don't belong
You're still my favorite girlfriend
You're still my favorite girlfriend
You're still my favorite girlfriend
Alice Long
