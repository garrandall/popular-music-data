Some things we don't talk about
Rather do without and just hold the smile
Falling in and out of love
Ashamed and proud of, together all the while


You can never say never
While we don't know when
But time and time again
Younger now than we were before


Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go


Picture, you're the queen of everything
Far as the eye can see under your command
I will be your guardian when all is crumbling
I'll steady your hand


You can never say never
While we don't know when
But time, time, and time again
Younger now than we were before


Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go


We're pulling apart and coming together again and again
We're growing apart, but we pull it together
Pull it together, together again


Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
