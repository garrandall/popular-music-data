It seems it's getting harder
Yeah, it's so hard to find o lover
Okay the boys are getting better
But they still fall down under
Close examination, baby
It used to be essential
But that was purely elemental
Investigations always led to
One way conversations
It took me a little while to get
Myself acquainted
It just about ready for the
Right inspiration...c'mon now

Heart don't fail me now
Could he be the one I've waited for...
Oh yeah
Could he be the one being that
I miss around here
He could be the one...
He could be the one...

I wake up every morning
Inside my private little jewel box
It's not so bad to be alone
Don't want no substitution...
I'd rather be alone than with someone and lonely
It'd take a lot more
Than strong arms to hold me...c'mon now

Heart don't fail me now
Don't mess my mind up
Ooo don't you fail me now
It's no wonder I'm so tough
Heart don't fail me now
