Darling now, you made me change my mind
Can go no further, because you got me chained and bound, oh
Taller than the tallest sky
Sweeter than a grape on a vine, now
Can go no further, because you got me chained and bound, right now, now

So glad, I'm so glad, I'm so glad
Oh, I don't have to worry no more
Oh my my my
Baby, somebody, somebody

What kind of life is this kind I'm trying living
Oh Lord, what kind of love is she trying to give me
I feel like I'm standing up and telling the word
I'm chained to your love

Darling, oh
Don't break this little heart of mine
There's no greater love than this love of yours and mine, oh
You walk with your head in the sky
Darling don't ever pass me by
I ain't going no further, because you got me chained and bound, oh now

So glad, I'm so glad, I'm so glad
Lord, I don't have to worry no more
She got me chained to her love, now
I don't, I don't want to be taken away, baby
I'm chained, I'm chained and a little bound, now, now, now
I'm chained, I'm chained to your love
I don't, I don't know darling I wanna to be taken away, now
Ou, just a little bit of soul
Just a little bit of soul, now
