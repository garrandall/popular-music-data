I never believed in things that I couldn't see
I said if I can't feel it then how could it be?
No, no magic could happen to me
And then I saw you, I couldn't believe it
You took my heart, I couldn't retrieve it
Said to myself, "What's it all about?"
Now I know there can be no doubt


You can do magic
You can have anything that you desire
Magic
And you know you're the one who can put out the fire


You know darn well
When you cast your spell you will get your way
When you hypnotize with your eyes
A heart of stone can turn to clay
De-de-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do-dit
De-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do
De-de-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do-dit
De-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do


And when the rain is beatin' upon the window pane
And when the night, it gets so cold
When I can't sleep again you come to me
I hold you tight, the rain disappears
Who would believe it?
With a word you dry my tears


You can do magic
You can have anything that you desire
Magic
And you know you're the one who can put out the fire


You know darn well
When you cast your spell you will get your way
When you hypnotize with your eyes
A heart of stone can turn to clay
De-de-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do-dit
De-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do


And if I wanted to
I could never be free
I never believed it was so true
But now it's so clear to me


You can do magic
You can have anything that you desire
Magic
And you know you're the one who can put out the fire


You know darn well
When you cast your spell you will get your way
When you hypnotize with your eyes
A heart of stone can turn to clay
De-de-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do-dit
De-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do
De-de-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do-dit
(You're the one who can put out the fire)
De-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do


De-de-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do-dit
(You're the one who can put out the fire)
De-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do
De-de-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do-dit
(You're the one who can put out the fire)
De-de-de-do-dit, do-do-do-do-do
De-de-de-do-dit
