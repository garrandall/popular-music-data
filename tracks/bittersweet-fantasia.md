Every now and then
I still get a flashback
Of the time I spent
Thinking you could be that one
Should I have just kept your love?

As I understand,
We did have some good times
On the other hand,
Got me crying all night
It was too much for my mind

So even though I left you
I can't forget you

'Cause when I think about you
It's bittersweet, it's bittersweet
Guess I'll always love you
It's bittersweet, it's bittersweet

When we were together
You ain't treat me right
Damn I really love you
I ain't gonna lie

'Cause when I think about you
It's bittersweet...

I still have the box
Full of things you gave me
Start to throw it out
Something always stops me, yeah
I'm not as over you as I say
Deep inside my heart
I made the right decision
But it's kinda hard
When your mind is thinking of,
Did I make a big mistake?

Even though I left you
I can't forget you

'Cause when I think about you
It's bittersweet, it's bittersweet
Guess I'll always love you
It's bittersweet, it's bittersweet

When we were together
You ain't treat me right
Damn I really love you
I ain't gonna lie

When I think about you
It's bittersweet...

See I don't understand
Like, somebody is gonna get hurt
Out of this situation
And you just hope it's not you

At times...

Part of me wants you, part of me don't
Part of me is missing you, part of me is gone
Part of me is saying that the love is still strong,
Part of me is letting go

So even though I left you
I can't forget you

'Cause when I think about you
It's bittersweet, it's bittersweet
Guess I'll always love you
It's bittersweet, it's bittersweet

When we were together
You ain't treat me right
Damn I really love you
I ain't gonna lie

When I think about you, it's bittersweet

It's bittersweet...
