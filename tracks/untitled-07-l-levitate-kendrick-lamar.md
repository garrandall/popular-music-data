She wonât get you high like this here, no
âFor Free?â wonât get you high, no, no, no
Two keys wonât get you high, no, no, no

Shut your fuckinâ mouth and get some cash, you bitch, you
You be in your feelings, I be in my bag, you bitch, you
Santaâs reindeer better have some ass, you bitch, you
Everything Iâm working, gotta be the gas, you bitch, you
Shut your fuckinâ mouth and get some cash, you bitch
You be in your feelings, I be in my bag, you bitch
Santaâs reindeer better have some ass, you bitch
Everything Iâm working, gotta be the
Levitate, levitate, levitate, levitate

Me donât want problems (me donât want problems)
Me donât want tricks (me donât want tricks)
Me do want dollars (me do want dollars)
Me want it big (me do want dollars)
Me donât want problems (we ride Impalas)
Me donât want tricks (me donât want tricks)
Me do want dollars (me donât want tricks)

Compton is where Iâm from
Is where Iâm from, is where Iâm from



Yeah, yeah
Young Egypt
Look, look
I feel like Pacino in Godfather, Iâm charged
Our father who art in Heaven, Kendrick at large
Came in the game with a plan of beatinâ the odds
What an accomplishment, broken promises
Kept my focus anonymous till I dealt with the consequence
The greatest and latest mogul, you know what time it is
You niggas fear me like yâall fear God
You sound frantic, I hear panic in your voice
Just know the mechanics of making your choice and writinâ your bars
Before you poke out your chest, loosen your bra
Before you step out of line and dance with the star
I could never end a career if it never start
The murderous capital, avenues lookinâ like evil dead zombies
With batteries to the head
The flattery of watchinâ my stock rise
The salary, the compensation tripled my cock size
I run through these stop signs with no brake fluid
Just premium gas, do it for dolo
Crash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo
Black excellence, pessimist died countinâ my coin
Hope itâs evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better
I blew cheddar on youth centers, buildings and Bimmers and blue leather
Forecasted my future, this is the future
The mastermind until my next album, more power to you
Gunshots



Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on

This is a fifteen minute song
Weâre just jamminâ out, we on stage
Taz, we just jamminâ out
Hundred thousand
Hundred thousand, you gotta see it!
Look, look, look, go back to the down note
They all sing this shit, everybody

Now I donât let you down, and for
You see, you see, you see, you see
But I donât shake you down, dog for you, you, you, you
They say the government ainât the truth, truth, truth, truth
And the politicians always mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth

But head is the answer
Head is the future
Donât second guess yourself
Come on, give me some help
Hey one more time, band, I need yâall to help me out right now
Head is the answer
Head is the future, itâs the future, that nigga said
Donât second guess yourself
Come on, give me some help
Say come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, my background singer
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

I said, girl you make me wanna uh
The ho screaming now
I said baby you make..
You make me wanna just AHHH!
Baby you got me speechless right now
Laughs
I gotta take it there, I ainât even playinâ no more
Said you just make me wanna Drake you down
To the ground, to the ground ground
Like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
You just make me wanna Drake you down
Down, around like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
And baby if your mamaâs around, if your mamaâs around
If your mamaâs around, if your mamaâs around
Tell her, tell her
No discrimination, sheâs young nigga chasinâ
And she can get this dick too!

I said come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Yeah, nigga
You gotta do it, man
We gonna lay that shit
We gonna lay that shit, and watch what itâs gonâ do
