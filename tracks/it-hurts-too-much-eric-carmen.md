A lot of empty words that I've already heard
Ain't gonna work tonight
Don't wanna talk about it anymore
'Cause that ain't gonna make things right
So now you're back again, you say it's not too late
To give it one more try
Well, I don't want to hear your lies
No, I don't want to hear your lies no more

I've got to find a way, I know, to let you go
'Cause it hurts too much
You say you'll never leave
And then, you're gone again
Oh, it hurts too much
It hurts too much, my love
I've heard it all before
I've got to tell you no, no, no
It hurts too much

You know I tried so hard
I spend so many nights
Waitin' for the phone to ring
But it's over now and I'm afraid
I don't feel much of anything
You say you want my love
You've played around enough
But now I can't forget
Well, honey there's nothing left
I ain't got nothin' left at all

I've got to find a way, I know, to let you go
'Cause it hurts too much
You say you'll never leave
And then, you're gone again
Oh, it hurts too much
It hurts too much, my love
I've heard it all before
I've got to tell you no, no, no
It hurts too much

Just when I thought I'd gotten over you
I hear you knockin' at my door
After everything you've put me through, you know
I just can't take it anymore

You say you want my love
You've played around enough
But now I can't forget
Well, honey there's nothing left
I ain't got nothin' left at all

I've got to find a
To find a way, I know, to let you go
'Cause it hurts too much
You say you'll never leave
And then, you're gone again
Oh, it hurts too much
It hurts too much, my love
I've heard it all before
I've got to tell you no, no, no
It hurts too much
Oh, it hurts too much
It hurts too much
Oh, it hurts too much
Listen when I tell you it hurts
Oh, it hurts too much
Oh mama it hurts
Oh, you hurt me so much
