Sometimes a man has to choose
And do something he doesn't wanna do
Do I live my life with you as my wife
Or do I go on and pursue my lifetime dream
I gotta do this for me
Cause if I don't I'll probably regret it
But if I do I'll probably regret it
How do I cope


How do you cope when
The one you love is with somebody else
And there's nothing you could do about it
How do you deal with
The fact that you had a chance
But you chose to turn away for your career
I gotta take it though it's heartbreakin'
It's something that I had to do
But nobody said that it would hurt so bad
So how do I live...how do I deal without you

It's killing me to know
That your heart's with me
But you're with him cause I chose
To be in this industry
Money, shows, and hoes come along with luxury and pain
Is all you see when you think about it
But this is the life that I was given
So I have to live it to the fullest
But how do I deal in the meantime without you



How do you deal when you can't be with
the one you love but the one you love is
with somebody else
What do you do when you know she don't love him
but she love me but she cant stand lovin' you faraway
you just deal with it,deal with it
(I don't wanna have to live with it)
you just deal with it,deal with it
(no,no,no)
you just deal with it,deal with it
(I don't want nobody else lovin' you)
you just deal with it,deal with it
(I don't nobody else lovin' me)



How do you cope when
The one you love is with somebody else
And there's nothing you could do about it.......
