It's going to take some time this time
To get myself in shape
I really feel out-of line this time
I really missed the gate

The birds on the telephone line (next time)
Are cryin' out to me (next time)
And I won't be so blind next time
And I'll find some harmony

But it's going to take some time this time
And I can't make demands
But like the young trees in the wintertime
I'll learn how to bend

After all the tears we've spent
How could we make amends
So it's one more round for experience

And I'm on the road again
And it's going to take some time this time

It's going to take some time this time
No matter what I've planned
But like the young trees in the wintertime
I'll learn how to bend

After all the tears we've spent
How could we make amends
So it's one more round for experience
And I'm on the road again
And it's going to take some time this time
