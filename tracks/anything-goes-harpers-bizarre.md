In olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
Now, Heaven knows
Anything goes

Good authors, too, who once knew better words (Anything goes, go, anything goes, go)
Now only use four-letter words
Writing prose
Anything goes

The world has gone mad today (Anything goes)
And good's bad today
And black's white today
And day's night today
When most guys today
That women prize today
Are just silly gigolos

So though I'm not a great romancer
I know that you're bound to answer
When I propose
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes (Anything will do)

Just think of those shocks you've got
And those knocks you've got
And those blues you've got
From that news you've got
And those pains you've got
If any brains you've got
From those little radios

So though I'm not a great romancer
I know that you're bound to answer
When I propose (When I propose)
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes

(When, when, when, when, when, when)
