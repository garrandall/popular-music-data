She's just teasin' you, though she's pleasin' you
With those smiles she's putting down, you're the jivest cat
In town
Don't you know that my baby loves me ?
Go on and work your show, that's the way things go
But can't you see she belongs to me?
Don't you know that my baby loves me ?


But it's alright, she's with you tonight
But it won't be for long, my baby will be coming
Home
Don't you know that my baby loves me ?
Now, watch what she does.. when it's time to go home
She'll get a cab but she'll be going home alone


Don't you know that my baby loves me ?
You done bought a lot of drinks. She's as high as
She can be
She'll get a cab. She'll be coming home with me
Don't you know that my baby loves me ?


You nothing but a popcorn
Sucker John
They call you the Island Man
'Cause you think you're raising sand
They call you doc
No more like you in stock
