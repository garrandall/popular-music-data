All I need is just one kiss from you
To see me through
Just once more might I look in your eyes
You'd be so surprised
And might I say
I'd love you in every sweet way
All I need is just one kiss from you

For myself if I had just one wish
It would be just this
You my love, for now and forevermore
For that's all I live for
And sometimes at night
I'd dream of you and you're out of sight
Take me in your arms and need me too

I guess we'll always just be good friends
Seems there it will end
You know we're missing such a sweet romance
Our one and only chance
Be with me tonight
And I'll prove how our love can be so right
All I need is just one kiss from you
All I need is just one kiss from you
All I need is just one kiss from you
