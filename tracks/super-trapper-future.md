The top come out the lamb cause I'm a super trapper
My pockets on fat Albert I'm a super trapper

I came up from out the apartments where they trigger happy
Bought my bitch a brand new Rollie and she still ain't happy
Got that Cartier with diamonds and I'm laughing at ya
911 turbo Porshe cause I'm a super trapper
Young Pluto is out the trenches but I'm big and badder
I can't never go back broke and that what really matter
Tryin to sabotage my crew boy you a swagger jacker
911 turbo Porsche cause I'm a super trapper

Rags to riches fuck these snitches I ain't scared
Cold ann shiesty put some prices on your head
I'm a product of da young nigga with dreams
And my left wrist cost a bird
I'm a Tropicana serve
Shorty unsure
Hope we don't do sherm
Came from out da curb
Made myself a don
I got a do payroll
My check go Jose Canseco
First class Saint Tropez hoe
You do whatever I say so

The top come out the lamb cause I'm a super trapper
My pockets on Fat Albert I'm a super trapper
Two door Maybach on the schedule that's the latest
Hard top Rari, Double R, that Mercedes

I came up from out the apartments where they trigger happy
Bought my bitch a brand new Rollie and she still ain't happy
Got that Cartier with diamonds and I'm laughing at ya
911 turbo Porshe cause I'm a super trapper
Young Pluto is out the trenches but I'm big and badder
I can't never go back broke and that what really matter
Tryin to sabotage my crew boy you a swagger jacker
911 turbo Porsche cause I'm a super trapper

All these foreigns got me lookin inconsiderate
All these exotic bitches got me like a racist
I just throw that in the safe and then count it
My tennis bracelets lookin like a water fountain
I got Benjamins, they taller than a mountain
I was pushing dope and then hired an accountant
Lamborgini I say lamb when I pronounce it
The doors go lift up in the air and they so spacious

I came up from out the apartments where they trigger happy
Bought my bitch a brand new Rollie and she still ain't happy
Got that Cartier with diamonds and I'm laughing at ya
911 turbo Porshe cause I'm a super trapper
Young Pluto is out the trenches but I'm big and badder
I can't never go back broke and that what really matter
Tryin to sabotage my crew boy you a swagger jacker
911 turbo Porsche cause I'm a super trapper

I'll raise ya bout that fetticini then some
Told her meet me at the boat I'm in its mad simple
I still up push the line nigga Julius Peppers
Keep money on my mind got a bad temper
Paid cash is very hard for me to do rentals
I can't hate ya cause I faked it til I made it too
Sober lady you betrayed got that faded
I'm trying pick this year who bitch who gon' be my lady
I got bitches different flavor this one Cajun
I'ma pimp her and a sister I'm her favorites
Keep it cordial with these niggas cause they traders
I'm on molly and its pink like it's Ms. Piggy

The top come out the lamb cause I'm a super trapper
My pockets on Fat Albert I'm a super trapper
Two door Maybach on the schedule that's the latest
Hard top Rari, Double R, that Mercedes
The top come out the lamb cause I'm a super trapper
My pockets on Fat Albert I'm a super trapper
Two door Maybach on the schedule that's the latest
