Okay

I was fourteen, she was twelve
Father travelled, hers as well, Europa...
Down the beaches, hand in hand
Twelfth of never on the sand
Then war took her away
We swore a vow that day

We'll be the Pirate Twins again, Europa
Oh my country
Europa
I'll walk beside you in the rain
Europa
Ta rÃ©publique
Europa

Nine years after, who'd I see
On the cover of a magazine? Europa...
Buy her singles and see all her films
Paste her pictures on my windowsill
But that's not quite the same - it isn't, is it?
Europa, my old friend

We'll be the Pirate Twins again, Europa
Oh my country
My country, Europa!
I'll walk beside you in the rain
Europa
Ta rÃ©publique
Europa

Blew in from the hoverport
She was back in London
Pushed past the papermen
Calling her name
She smiled for the cameras
As the bodyguard grabbed me
Her eyes were gone forever
As they drove her away

We'll be the Pirate Twins again, Europa
Oh my country
Europa
I'll walk beside you in the rain
Europa
Ta rÃ©publique
Europa

We'll be the Pirate Twins again
Europa
Oh my country, look at my country now!
I'll stand beside you in the rain
Europa
Ta rÃ©publique
Europa

Down in some bar along the Strand
Europa
Oh my country
Europa
I'll walk beside you in the rain
Europa
Ta rÃ©publique...
