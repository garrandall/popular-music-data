Some dreams live on in time forever
Those dreams, you want with all
Your heart

And I'll do whatever it takes
Follow through with the promise I made
Put it all on the line
What I hoped for at last would be mine

If I could reach, higher
Just for one moment touch the sky
From that one moment
In my life
I'm gonna be stronger
Know that I've tried my
Very best
I'd put my spirit to the test
If I could reach

Some days are meant to be
Remembered
Those days we rise above
The stars

So I'll go the distance
This time
Seeing more the higher
I climb
That the more I believe
All the more that this
Dream will be mine

If I could reach, higher
Just for one moment touch

The sky
From that one moment
In my life
I'm gonna be stronger
Know that I've tried my
Very best
I'd put my spirit to the test
If I could reach

If I could reach, higher
Just for one moment touch the sky
From that one moment
In my life
I'm gonna be stronger
I'm gonna be so much stronger
Yes I am
I put my spirit to the test

If I could reach, higher
If I could, if I could,
If I could reach
Reach, I'd reach, I'd reach
I'd reach, I'd reach so
Much higher
Be stronger
