Sometimes, lonely nights turn into sunny days
I never thought I'd feel this way, I never knew 
That you and I were meant to be in love

Oh darling, you've always been around to see me through
How was I to know you make my dreams come true?
Time and time again we fall, always on our own

But now we're friends in love
Hoping that we always will be friends in love
Strong when we're together
Darling now we've got forever and a day
Don't you go away

Remember, every time I cried you came to me
Oh much to my surprise I found someone who could see
Through the nights of loneliness
You were always there for me

We're friends in love
Hoping that we always will be friends in love
Strong when we're together
Darling now we've got forever and a day
Don't you go away

You turn around, looked my way
I can't say that it hasn't crossed my mind
I'd loved you all along

And now we're leaving yesterday behind
We'll never be alone, oh

Friends in love
Hoping that we always will be friends in love
Strong when we're together
Darling now we've got forever and a day
Don't you go away

You and I are friends in love
Hoping that we always will be friends in love
Strong when we're together
Darling now we've got forever and a day
Don't you go away
