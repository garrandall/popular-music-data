When I get home babe, I'm gonna light your fire
All day I've been thinking about you babe
You're my one desire
Gonna wrap my arms around you
Hold you close to me
Oh babe I wanna taste your lips
I wanna fill your fantasy
I don't know what I'd do without you, babe
Don't know where I'd be
You're not just another love
No, you're everything to me
Every time I'm with you baby
Can't believe it's true
When you're laying in my arms
And you do the things you do
You can see it in my eyes
I can feel it in your touch
You don't have to say a thing
Just let me show how much
I love you, I need you, babe
I wanna kiss you all over
And over again
I wanna kiss you all over
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in
No one else can ever make me feel the way you do
Oh keep on loving me baby
And I keep on loving you
It's easy to see when something's right and something wrong
Well stay with me baby
And hold me all night long
So show me, show me everything you do
Cause baby no one does it quite like you
I love you, I need you, babe
I wanna kiss you all over
And over again
I wanna kiss you all over
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in
Stay with me
Lay with me
Holding me
Loving me, baby
Here with me
Near with me
Feeling you close to me, baby
So show me, show me everything you do
Cause baby no one does it quite like you
I love you, I need you, babe
I wanna kiss you all over
And over again
I wanna kiss you all over
Till the night closes in...
