Rollie, Rollie, Rollie
Steve Aoki

I just want a Rollie, Rollie, Rollie with a dab of ranch
I already got some designer to hold up my pants
I just want some ice on my wrist so I look better when I dance
Have you lookin' at it, put you in a trance
I just want a Rollie, Rollie, Rollie with a dab of ranch
I already got some designer to hold up my pants
I just want some ice on my wrist so I look better when I dance
Have you lookin' at it, put you in a trance
Yeah, yeah, yeah
All I ever wanted was a Rollie, Rollie
All I ever wanted was a Rollie, Rollie
Cooler than a snowman with the ice all on me
All I ever wanted was a Rollie, Rollie...
All I ever wanted was a Rollie, Rollie


I just want a Rollie, Rollie, Rollie with a dab of ranch
I already got some designer to hold up my pants
I just want some ice on my wrist so I look better when I dance
Have you lookin' at it, put you in a trance
Yeah, yeah, yeah
All I ever wanted was a Rollie, Rollie
All I ever wanted was a Rollie, Rollie
Cooler than a snowman with the ice all on me
Now your chick all on me, now your chick all on me


Blue face Rollie, red face Rollie, ayy
Purple face Rollie like some Teletubbies, ayy
Baby diamonds wet, shinin' like some guppies, woah
Your man's hatin', probably 'cause his girl love me, ayy
I pull up to the mall and I'm flexin' on your hoe
Jahleele in the cut, and he got them buffies, ayy (got them buffies)
Whiteskins got me goin' crazy, crazy, ayy
Your girl love me 'cause she prolly want my baby, ayy (woo)


I just want a Rollie, Rollie, Rollie with a dab of ranch
I already got some designer to hold up my pants
I just want some ice on my wrist so I look better when I dance
Have you lookin' at it, put you in a trance
Yeah, yeah, yeah
All I ever wanted was a Rollie, Rollie
All I ever wanted was a Rollie, Rollie
Cooler than a snowman with the ice all on me
All I ever wanted was a Rollie, Rollie...
All I ever wanted was a Rollie, Rollie


All I ever wanted was a Rollie, Rollie
All I ever wanted was a Rollie, Rollie
Cooler than a snowman with the ice all on me
Now your chick all on me, now your chick all on me (she on me)
