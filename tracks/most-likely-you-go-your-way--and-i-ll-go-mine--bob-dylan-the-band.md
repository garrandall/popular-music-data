You say you love me and you're thinkin' of me
But you know you could be wrong
You say you told me that you wanna hold me
But you know you're not that strong

I just can't do what I've done before
And I just can't beg you any more
I'm gonna let you pass
Pass and I'll go last

Then the time will tell
Who has fell
Who's been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine

You say you're shakin' and you are always breakin'
But you know how hard you try
You say you're supernatural
An' I've never heard much of you
I know sometimes you lie

Sometimes it gets so hard to care
It can't be this way everywhere
And I'm gonna let you pass
Yes and I'll go last

Then the time will tell
Who has fell
And who's been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine

The judge, he's holdin' a grudge
And he's about to call on you
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts
Watch out he don't fall on you

You say you're sorry for tellin' me stories
You know I believe are true
Say ya got some other, other kind of lover
And yes, I believe you do

You say my kisses are not like his
Ya, well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is
I'm gonna let you pass
Pass and I'll go last

Then the time will tell
Who has fell
Who's been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine
