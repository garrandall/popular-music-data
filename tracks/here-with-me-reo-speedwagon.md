Maybe it's too late but this feelin is runnin through my soul
I think I learned what love is but I'm afraid I let it go
Maybe it's too late, maybe you've already changed your mind
Turned lovin into leavin and I'm on the outside
You can't take these words to bed with you and hold onto them at night
They can't erase the emptiness and make everything alright
But your laughter and your tenderness will never disappear
No matter where you are tonight a part of you is here with me
Here with me, I don't know where you are, all I know is I need you to be
Here with me, I know it's not to late, to turn around and get it straight
It's not fate to have you here with me
I can hear your voice promising your love will never die
I can feel your golden skin on mine beneath the desert sky
So how can it be true, how can you just turn and let me go
Let the story of your life with mine forever go untold
I can't take these words to bed with me and hold onto them at night
They can't erase the emptiness and make everything alright
Cause your laughter and your tenderness will never disappear
No matter where you are tonight a part of you is here with me
Here with me, I don't know where you are, all I know is I need you to be
Here with me, I know it's not too late, to turn around and get it straight
It's not fate to have you here with me



Here with me, I don't know where you are, all I know is I need you to be
Here with me, I know it's not to late, to turn around and get it straight
It's not fate to have you here with me
