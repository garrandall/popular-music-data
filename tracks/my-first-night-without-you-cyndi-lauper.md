I'm driving home from work
Knowing you're not there
I used to hurry home
Now I don't even care
The sun is in my eyes
So I can't see
But when it sets down behind the
Mountain it's gonna be

My first night without you
My first night without you
My first night without you
Oh... without you

I sit here like a fool
Remembering everything
The way we used to talk
The songs that we used to sing
I've got to try and leave
The past behind
But my memory's so good
I think that I'm losing my mind

My first night without you
My first night without you
And I wonder what I'll do
Oh... without you

Will I be able to sleep
Will I lie in my bed and weep
What if I forget
And reach for you
Will I dream about you
My first night... my first night

My first night without you
My first night without you
And I wonder what I'll do, oh...

My first night without you
My first night without you
And I wonder how I'll get through
Oh... without you
