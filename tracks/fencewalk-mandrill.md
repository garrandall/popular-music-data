Hey, got your 
But it's not what you say
It's what you do
Huh, yeah

Log on
Tellin' folks do it softly
Long steady do
If I know you do

Turn on your fear like a slowman
Not what you think
It's what you feel

About a time we go to be there
Don't think you feel
If it's not for real
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Rocket do
Said you want some
Not what you want
It's what you give

Get what you want, yeah

Oh , 
But she don't want you
