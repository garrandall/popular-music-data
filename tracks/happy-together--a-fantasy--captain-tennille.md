Imagine me and you, I do
I think about you day and night
It's only right

To think about the one you love
And hold her tight
So happy together

If I should call you up
Invest a dime
And you say you belong to me
You'd ease my mind

Imagine how the world
Could be so very fine
So happy together

I can't see me
Loving nobody but you
For all my life
When you're near me
Baby, the skies'll be blue
For all my life

Me and you and you and me
No matter how they
Toss the dice, it had to be

The only one for me is you
And you for me
So happy together

If I should call you up
Invest a dime
And you say you belong to me
You'd ease my mind

Imagine how the world
Could be so very fine
So happy together
Happy together
Happy together

I can't see me
Loving nobody but you
For all my life
When you're near me
Baby, the skies'll be blue
For all my life

I can't see me
Loving nobody but you
For all my life
When you're near me
Baby, the skies'll be blue
For all my life

I can't see me
Loving nobody but you
For all my life
When you're near me
Baby, the skies'll be blue
For all my life

All my life!
