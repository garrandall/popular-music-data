LSD Duckblind
Alright. Wait a minute
(False start ...)
I
(Starting over ...)
One, ... ... Two, ...
One, ... Two,
One, Two, Three, Four

I ... went to a dance, ah, just the other night
Other night, other night, other night
The dance they was doin' there, it was out of sight
Out-a-sight, out-a-sight, out-a-sight
I knew right away, yeah, that there was nothing to it
Nothin' to it, nothin' to it, nothin' to it
I could tell right away, oh boy, even I could do it
Even I could do it, I could do it, I could do it

Well, first step: you got to move to the left
Second step: you got to go for yourself
Third step: well, you're doin' alright
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

Grab yourself a partner, then you start it movin' too
To and fro, to and fro, to and fro
The next thing you know, hey, you want to do it some more
Do it some more, do it some more, do it some more
I knew right away, yeah, that there was nothing to it
Nothin' to it, nothin' to it, nothin' to it
I could tell right away, oh boy, even I could do it
Even I could do it, I could do it, I could do it

Yeah, first step: you got to move to the left
Second step: you got to go for yourself
Third step: well, you're doin' alright
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

You grab yourself a partner, then you start it movin' too
To and fro, to and fro, to and fro
You get out on the floor and start doin' it some more
Do it some more, do it some more, do it some more
I knew right away, yeah, that there was nothing to it
Nothin' to it, nothin' to it, nothin' to it
I could tell right away, oh boy, even I could do it
Even I could do it, I could do it, I could do it

I went to a dance just the other night
Other night, other night, other night
The dance they was doin', yeah, it was out of sight
Out-a-sight, out-a-sight, out-a-sight
I knew right away, yeah, there was nothing to it
Nothin' to it, nothin' to it, nothin' to it
I could tell right away, oh boy, even I could do it
Even I could do it, I could do it, I could do it

I went to the dance
I went to the dance
