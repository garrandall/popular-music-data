I lived in tunnels
Sometimes there was no rice and the water was bad
I was married, and very happy
My husband was just a regular guy, but he was killed
In my room, light from a light bulb
Smoke from fire
I think of Sony and Toyota
I see smiling faces, nights without fear
Holding a man who won't be gone when day comes
I dream too, Yankee

On R&R here comes a walking paycheque
Back from the front, he's going to have some fun
Holding rubbers and a gun
The grunt will grunt & the girl will take a raincheck
He ain't going to be the first
G.I. on a two day pass
A G-string separates the words
Writ in lipstick across her ass

F.M.U.S.A.
F.M.U.S.A.
Pump it up, but first you pay
F.M.U.S.A.
I dream too, Yankee
F.M.U.S.A.
I'm down on my knees, I'm saying

In this freefire zone he wants to be unseen
Acid, junk, and speed help his heart freeze
He wants a woman to do him on her knees
Says "No blue eyed blondes back home believe in me"

He needs the gook girl
While she spills his seed
She says "If I weren't doing you I'd be V.C."

F.M.U.S.A.
F.M.U.S.A.
Pump it up, but first you pay
F.M.U.S.A.
I dream too, Yankee
F.M.U.S.A.
I'm down on my knees, I'm saying

Yo. I come from Detroit. Motor City? Yeah.
I never had nothing.
Shit. Probably won't live that long
It's the Brothers get most combat missions
Putting our asses on the line
While all the rich kids finish college
But we party
Yeah we get R + R.
We party seriously man 
Stoned out of our fucking trees
Hunting that Saigon Poontang,
You know what I mean
Them bitches are fucking wild.

F.M.U.S.A.
F.M.U.S.A.
Pump it up, but first you pay
F.M.U.S.A.
I dream too, Yankee
F.M.U.S.A.
I'm down on my knees, I'm saying

F.M.U.S.A.
F.M.U.S.A.
Pump it up, but first you pay
F.M.U.S.A.
I dream too, Yankee
