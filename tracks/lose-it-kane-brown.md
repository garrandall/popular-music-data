That lit up, ringin', buzzin', good for nothing phone in your hand
The directions to the party that's just started with that cover band
That old school radio station, that's just driving till it's faded, girl
Let's lose it, tonight

Cause when you do that thing right there
Flippin' your hair, baby, I swear

I don't think you know what you're doin' to me, you got
My heart skip-skippin' a beat, you're not
Close enough
So that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

Let's start with them Luchese's, baby, kick 'em to the floor board
Them bobby pins holdin' your hair up, girl, you don't need 'em no more
That dress hangin' off your shoulder as you move a little closer
Yeah, let's lose it (lose it), tonight
Yeah, girl

I don't think you know what you're doin' to me, you got
My heart skip-skippin' a beat, you're now
Close enough 
So that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

Cause when you do that thing right there
Flippin' your hair, baby, I swear

I don't think you know what you're doin' to me, you got
My heart skip-skippin' a beat, you're not
Close enough 
So that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it (I lose it)
Yeah, I lose it
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
