They say in this world
Nothing lasts forever
But I don't believe that’s true

Cause the way that I feel
When we're together
I know that's the way
I'll always feel for you


From now
Until forever
That's how long I'll be true

I'll make you this vow
And promise you now
Until forever
I'll never stop loving you


And there'll come a day
When the world stops turning
And stars would fall from the sky

But this feeling will last
When the sun stops burning
All I wanna do is love you
Till the end of time


From now
Until forever
That's how long I'll be true
I’ll make you this vow
And promise you now
Until forever

I'll never stop
Never stop
I'll never stop loving you


It’s gonna take more than a lifetime
To give you all the love
All the love I feel for you tonight


From now until forever
That's how long I'll be true
I'll make you this vow
And promise you now
Until forever

I'll never stop
Never stop
I'll never stop loving you

From now until forever
Oh, yeah
From now until forever
When the world stops turning
From now until forever
When the sun stops burning

From now until
I'll never stop loving you
From now until
I'll never stop loving you
From now until
I'll never stop loving you
