I bet you'd never guess who I saw tonight
Guess you didn't see me in those low dim lights
I knew who she was
By the ring still on her hand
Sure looked like you still wanted to be her man

So I guess that means that things are better
Must not be so bad at home
I thought it looked like you were leavin'
But it don't
And I heard you tell her you still love her
So it doesn't matter what you say
I saw it all
From a table away

I thought she was pretty
She's nothing like the things you said
The woman you described
Couldn't even turn your head
The two of you look lost inside a world all your own
Like you couldn't wait to get her alone

So I guess that means that things are better
Must not be so bad at home
I thought it looked like you were leavin'
But it don't
And I heard you tell her you still love her
So it doesn't matter what you say
I saw it all
From a table away

And I heard you tell her you still love her
So it doesn't matter what you say
I saw it all
From a table away
Yes you're gonna stay
A table away
