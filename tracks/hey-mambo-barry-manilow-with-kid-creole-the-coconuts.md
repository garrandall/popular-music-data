Barry Manilow F/ Kid Creole And The Coconuts
Miscellaneous
Hey Mambo
BARRY:
Nobody knew who he really was
But they called him Mambo when he played

KID CREOLE:
He became the King
King of Latin Swing

BOTH:
And oh, the music that he made

Hey Mambo
Did your mama teach you that
Hey Mambo
Did she know what she begat

KID CREOLE:
They used to come in their fancy threads
And he always turned them inside out

BARRY:
They would jam the floor

BOTH:
They would beg for more

BARRY:
And when they got it they would shout

BOTH:
Hey Mambo
Did your mama teach you that
Hey Mambo
Did she know what she begat

BOTH:
Take it away
Do it again
Hey Mambo
