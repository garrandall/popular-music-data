Nobody knew who he really was
But they called him Mambo when he played
He became the king, king of Latin swing
And oh, the music that he made

Hey mambo
Did your mama teach you that
Hey mambo
Did she know what she begat

They used to come in their fancy threads
And he always turned them inside out
They would jam the floor, they would beg for more
And when they got it they would shout

Hey mambo
Did your mama teach you that
Hey mambo
Did she know what she begat
Take it away

Hey mambo
Did your mama teach you that
Hey mambo
Did she know what she begat
Take it away [Incomprehensible]
Do it again

Hey mambo, hey mambo
Hey mambo, hey mambo
Hey mambo
