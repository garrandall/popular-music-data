 Keep on lovin' me honey, keep on lovin' me true
 Baby, I'm gonna love you no matter what you do
 Just so long as I can have it all, nothin' but you
 So don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
 'Cause I would stop right where I stand
 I'd just be afraid of a man
 Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause if you leave you might as well take the air I breathe

 Keep on lovin' me honey, don't you go nowhere
 Don't you know I'm satisfied with your tender care?
 And I get my inspiration, darlin', just knowin' you're there
 So don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
 'Cause like a leaf out on a tree
 You've become a part of me
 Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause if you leave you might as well take the air I breathe

 Would you take the heavens out of the sky
Imagine what the world would be like if the rivers ran dry
 Oh Tammi
 What good am I without you
 I can't do without you, darlin'
 Like a sea wihout a shore
Kicking forever more

 Keep on lovin' me honey, don't you change your mind
 Sugar, I can't bear the thought of ever leavin' you behind
 No matter what I do, another you I'll never find
 So don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
 'Cause I would stop right where I stand
 I'd just be afraid of a man
 Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause if you leave you might as well take the air I breathe
If you leave you might as well take the air I breathe
Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause I need your love, I need you so desperately
Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
