It don't come easy
You know it don't come easy
It don't come easy
You know it don't come easy


Got to pay your dues if you wanna sing the blues
And you know it don't come easy
You don't have to shout or leap about
You can even play them easy


Forget about the past and all your sorrows
The future won't last
It will soon be over tomorrow


I don't ask for much, I only want trust
And you know it don't come easy
And this love of mine keeps growing all the time
And you know it just ain't easy


Open up your heart, let's come together
Use a little love
And we will make it work out better


Got to pay your dues if you wanna sing the blues
And you know it don't come easy
You don't have to shout or leap about
You can even play them easy


Peace, remember peace is how we make it
Here within your reach
If you're big enough to take it


I don't ask for much, I only want trust
And you know it don't come easy
And this love of mine keeps growing all the time
And you know it don't come easy
