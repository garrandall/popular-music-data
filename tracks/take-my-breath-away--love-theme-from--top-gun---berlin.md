Watching every motion in my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean, finally lovers know no shame
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say


Take my breath away
Take my breath away


Watching, I keep waiting, still anticipating love
Never hesitating to become the fated ones
Turning and returning to some secret place to find
Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say


My love, take my breath away


Through the hourglass I saw you
In time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you
And turned to hear you say
"If only for today, I am unafraid"


Take my breath away
Take my breath away


Watching every motion in this foolish lover's game
Haunted by the notion, somewhere there's a love in flames
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn my way and say


Take my breath away
My love, take my breath away
My love, take my breath away
My love, take my breath away
My love
