Communication always leaves me incomplete,
The grass is greener, but it's grown beneath my feet...
Love inspiration is a message on a wing,
But I have left it in the words you'll never sing...

Communication let me down,
And I'm left here
Communication let me down,
And I'm left here, I'm left here again!

Telex or tell me, but it's always second-hand,
I'm incognito but no rendezvous's been planned...
Dictate or relay, I could send it to your home,
"Return to Sender" - I could sing it down the phone!

Communication let me down,
But I'm left here
Communication let me down,
But I'm left here, I'm left here, I, I, I...

(Dictate!)
(Relay!)

I'm sitting here, waiting by the telephone,
Waiting for the bell to ring,
Short change, fumble,
Dial-a-heart trouble,
And I ain't got time for searching through the rubble, oh no!
Well, I know-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

Communication let me down,
And I'm left here
Communication let me down
And I'm left here, I'm left here, I, I, I...

(I'm a-left a-here-oh!)
(I'm a-left a-here-oh!)
(I'm a-left a-here-oh!)
(I'm a-left a-here-oh!)
(I'm a-left a-here-oh!)
(I'm a-left a-here-oh!)
(I'm a-left a-here-oh!)
(I'm a-left a-here-oh!)
