I've been meaning to tell you
I've got this feeling
That won't subside

I look at you and I fantasize
You're mine tonight
Now I've got you in my sights


With these hungry eyes
One look at you
And I can't disguise
I've got hungry eyes
I feel the magic between you and I


I want to hold you
So hear me out
I want to show you what love's all about

Darling
Tonight
Now I've got you in my sights


With these hungry eyes
One look at you
And I can't disguise
I've got hungry eyes
I feel the magic between you and I

I've got hungry eyes
Now I've got you in my sights
With the hungry eyes
Now did I take you by surprise?

I need you to see
This love was meant to be


I've got hungry eyes
One look at you
And I can't disguise
I've got hungry eyes
I feel the magic between you and I

I've got hungry eyes
Now I've got you in my sights
With the hungry eyes
Now did I take you by surprise?
With my hungry eyes

I've got hungry eyes
Now I've got you in my sights
With my hungry eyes
