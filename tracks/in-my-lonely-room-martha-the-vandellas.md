Every single time
You take me out with you
You always flirt around
With someone new
But I never criticize
The tearful things you do
'Cause I'm so afraid
Of losing you


But in my lonely room
Tears I don't have to hide
'Cause I just lock my door
And let myself go and
Lay right down and cry


Every place we go
People are whispering
About your flirting ways
And it hurts me so to hear
But in the public's eye
I just push behind
All my hurt inside
And pretend I don't mind


But in my lonely room
Tears I don't have to hide
In my lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely room


I push my pride aside
And lay right down and cry
In my lonely room
In my lonely room
Let myself go
