I am so sick, I'm hoping you notice, yeah baby
So sick of the same old love
Like a dose of the same old drug, yeah baby
Really starting to get under my skin
When you see signs, get with it, yeah baby
Tell me why, love's a lie


I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
Right now, now

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
Iâm so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Iâm so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
Iâm so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)

I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
I know, I've heard it all
So don't you try and change your mind
Cause I won't be changing too, you know

You can't believe, still can't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
Right now, now

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
Iâm so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Iâm so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
Iâm so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)


Swear it drives me crazy
So sick of the same old love baby
And I don't mean to make you cry baby
I thought can be by your side baby
Thought you were my ride or die baby
So sick of the same old love baby
And I don't mean to make you cry baby
Thought you were my ride or die baby


I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
Iâm so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Iâm so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
Iâm so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
