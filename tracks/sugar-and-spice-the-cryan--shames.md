Sugar and spice and all things nice, kisses sweeter than wine
Sugar and spice and all things nice, you know that little girl is mine

Everybody stops and stares at my baby, when she's walking down the street
People passing by just look at my baby, cause my baby looks so sweet

You know she's
Sugar and spice and all things nice, kisses sweeter than wine
Sugar and spice and all things nice, you know that little girl is mine

Every time we kiss I get that feeling, every time we simply meet
When I see her smile I get that feeling, cause my baby looks so sweet

You know she's
Sugar and spice and all things nice, kisses sweeter than wine
Sugar and spice and all things nice, you know that little girl is mine

Sugar and spice and all things nice, kisses sweeter than wine
Sugar and spice and all things nice, you know that little girl is mine

Never eve knew a girl so lovely, sweet enough to want to meet
Everyone's crazy 'bout my baby, cause my baby looks so sweet

You know she's
Sugar and spice and all things nice, kisses sweeter than wine
Sugar and spice and all things nice, you know that little girl is mine
