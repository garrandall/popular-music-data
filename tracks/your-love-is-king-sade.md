Your love is king
Crown you with my heart
Your love is king
Never need to part
Your kisses ring
Round and round and round my head
Touching the very part of me
It's making my soul sing
Tearing the very heart of me
I'm crying out for more 
Your love is king
Crown you with my heart
Your love is king
You're the ruler of my heart
Your kisses ring
Round and round and round my head
Touching the very part of me
It's making my soul sing
I'm crying out for more
Your love is king 

I'm coming on
I'm coming
You're making me dance
Inside 

Your love is king
Crown you with my heart
Your love is king
Never need to part
Your kisses ring
Round and round and round my head
Touching the very part of me
It's making my soul sing
Tearing the very heart of me
I'm crying out for more 

Touching the very part of me
It's making my soul sing
I'm crying out for more
Your love is king 

This is no
Blind faith
This is no
Sad or sorry dream
This is no
Blind faith 

Your love, your love is real
(your love is king)
Gotta crown me with your heart
(your love is king)
Never never need to part
(your love is king)
Touch me
(your love is king)
never letting go
(your love is king)
Your Love is King
never letting go
(your love is king)
never gonna give it up
(your love is king)
I'm comming
(your love is king)
making me dance
