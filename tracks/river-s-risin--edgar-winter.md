See, the river's risin'
See, you're realizin'

The moon is smilin', the stars are shinin'
It's happenin' all again
'Cause time is movin, plainly groovin'
It's just around the bend

See, and the city is growin'
See, and the country's goin'

The wind is sweepin', the rain is weepin'
It's happenin' all again
'Cause time is movin', plainly provin'
It's just around the, just around the
It's just around the bend

See, hey, hey, the Earth is changin'
See, there'll be nothin' remainin'

The world is turnin', the sun is burnin'
It's happenin' all again
'Cause time is movin', plainly provin'
It's just around the, just around the
It's just around the bend

The moon is smilin', the stars are shinin'
It's happenin? all again
'Cause time is movin?, plainly groovin'
It's just around the bend

The wind is sweepin', the rain is weepin'
It's happenin' all again
'Cause time is movin', plainly groovin'
It's just around the bend

No, it's just around the bend
Said, it's just around the bend
It's just around the bend
