Walk slow, don't run
Our love is slow but
We're having so much fun
So walk slow, don't run
Away from love

So walk slow, don't run
Every earthly power
Has ways of having fun
So when the race is won
Walk slow

And don't forget to remember
To take my love wherever you go
We need each other
And I'll always love you so
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Walk slow, don't run
Our love is so slow
But we're having fun
Walk slow, don't run
Away from love

Oh, walk slow
Don't run away from love
