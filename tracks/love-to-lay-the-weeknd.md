It has begun again, my friend
In this room, we are nothing but strangers in a bed
You made me fall again, my friend
How can I forget when you said love was just pretend?


Well I told her I've been thinkin' 'bout her lately
But she told me that to love her is so crazy


'Cause she loves to lay
I learned the hard way
She loves to lay, I'm all to blame
I learned the hard way
She loves to lay
Know I learned the hard way
She loves to lay, it's all a game
I learned the hard way


It has begun again, my friend
In your heart, we are nothing but strangers in the end


Then I told her I've been thinkin' 'bout her lately
But she told me that to love her is so crazy


'Cause she loves to lay
I learned the hard way
She loves to lay, I'm all to blame
I learned the hard way
She loves to lay
Know I learned the hard way
She loves to lay, it's all a game
I learned the hard way


I feel there's someone else
Worth your time, from the start
He's just one call away
From your mind, and your heart
It has begun, begun
Again, again, my friend, hey!


'Cause she loves to lay
I learned the hard way
She loves to lay, I'm all to blame
I learned the hard way
She loves to lay
Know I learned the hard way
She loves to lay, it's all a game
I learned the hard way
