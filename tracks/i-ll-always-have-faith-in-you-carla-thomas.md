I will always have faith in you
Oh, oh, in all you strive to do
People may say you don't want me
And don't need me and don't love me
But I will always have faith in you

Idle gossip is for the weak man
Oh, oh, a man who won't understand
But until I hear you say you don't want me
Don't need me and don't love me
I will always have faith in you

I love you dearest, more than words
Or gifts could ever say
I love you with my heart and soul
In every gentle way

And darling, I love you for each moment
Of each day and night
And for your boundless faith in me
In all I strive to do

I couldn't say sufficient thanks
To really let you know
But please believe me, dearest
I really, I really love you so

For if we keep faith, yes
You're gonna want me
And need me and love me
I will always have faith in you
I will always have faith in you
