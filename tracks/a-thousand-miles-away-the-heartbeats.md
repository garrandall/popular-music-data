I'm all alone
Feeling so blue
Thinking about you
And the love we once knew
And each time I do
It brings back those memories
Of El Monte

Remember the dance
I held you so tight
The Satins were singing
In the still of the night
You gave me your heart
And your love undying
Now I'm alone
I'm sitting here crying

If only they had
Those dances again
I'd know where to find you
And all my old friends
The Shields would sing
"You cheated. You lied..."
And the Heartbeats
"You're a thousand miles away..."
And the Medaillons with "The Letter" and
"Sweet words of his mortality..."
Marvin and Johnny with
"Cherry Pie..."
And then, Tony Allen with
"Night owl..."
And I, Cleve Duncan, along with the Penguins will sing
"Earth angel
Earth angel
Will you be mine?"
At El Monte

If I could go back
To those days of the past
I'd show you a love
A love that would last
Oh, I remember
Those wonderful dances
In El Monte
In El Monte
"Earth angel
Earth angel
Will you be mine?"
At El Monte
