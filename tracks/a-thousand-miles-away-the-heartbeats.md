You're a thousand miles away
But I still have your love to remember you by
Oh, my darling, dry your eyes
Daddy's coming home soon

On my knees every day
All I do is pray, baby, just for you
Hope you always want me too
Daddy's coming home soon

It may be on a Sunday morning
It may be on a Tuesday afternoon
But no matter what the day is
I'm going to make it my business to get home soon

You're a thousand miles away
But I still have your love to remember you by
Oh, my darling, dry your eyes
Daddy's coming home soon
