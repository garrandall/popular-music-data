Da, da, da, da, da,
Jackie Wilson said
It was "Reet-Petite"
Kinda love you got
Knock me off my feet
Let it all hang out
Oh, let it all hang out.
And you know
I'm so wired-up
Don't need no coffee in my cup
Let it all hang out
Let it all hang out.

Watch this:
Ding-a-ling-a-ling
Ding-a-ling-a-ling-ding
Ding-a-ling-a-ling
Ding-a-ling-a-ling-ding
Do-da-do-da
I'm in heaven, I'm in heaven
I'm in heaven, when you smile
When you smile, when you smile
When you smile.
And when you walk
Across the room
You make my heart go
Boom-boom-boom
Let it all hang out
Baby, let it all hang out
And ev'ry time
You look that way
Honey chile, you make my day
Let it all hang out
Like the man said: let it all hang out.

Watch this:
Ding-a-ling-a-ling ... etc.
