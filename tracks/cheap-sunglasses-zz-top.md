When you wake up in the morning and the light is hurt your head
The first thing you do when you get up out of bed
Is hit that streets a-runnin' and try to meet the masses
And go get yourself some cheap sunglasses

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Spied a little thing and I followed her all night
In a funky fine Levi's and her sweater kind of tight
She had a west coast strut that was sweet as molasses
But what really knocked me out was her cheap sunglasses

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Now go out and get yourself some thick black frames
With the glass so dark they won't even know your name
And the choice is up to you 'cause they come in two classes
Rhinestone shades and cheap sunglasses

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
