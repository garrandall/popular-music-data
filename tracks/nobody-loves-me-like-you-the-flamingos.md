Oh my darling I just love you so;
There's one thing that I want you to know
And that's no one can hold me like you
No one can kiss me like you
No one loves me like you do
Every thing that I say I do;
I do and say it baby just for you
Because no one can hold me like you
No one can kiss me like you
No one loves me like you do Whenever I'm with you I feel so divine
There's one thing that you can do for me
And that's tell me that your mine;
Mine all mine Every thing that I say and do;
I do and say it baby just for you
Because no one can hold me like you
No one can kiss me like you
No one love's me like you do
