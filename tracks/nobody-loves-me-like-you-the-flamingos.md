You spun your web back a Sunday or two
I ain't never met nobody
Like the likes of you
You got me preachin' the news
You turned down my road and decided to stay
And I took a shine to your hair
And your hillbillly ways
And how you kiss on my face
I got a bone deep feelin'
You're the start of the good ole days


Well I still remember
You came by my trailer
With chicken and some homemade wine
The dogs got to barkin'
When we got the sparkin'
We almost set the house on fire
Well I got a big heapin' helpin'
Of the stuff I get a hankerin' for
But honey your homespun love
Just keeps me comin' back for more

I like the flamingos you stuck in your yard
And I like the notions you stick in my head and my heart
Yeah and how you fix on my car
Well I reckon I'm lucky you're everything I need so far
