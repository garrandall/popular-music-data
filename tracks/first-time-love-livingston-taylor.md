First time you fall for somebody
The world becomes your lucky star
You wander around like a peacock
With your lover on your arm

Next time you fall
You think you've heard it all
No one could turn your insides out
And your friends hear you say
If your heart slips away
I'll wonder what its all about

And it's first time love, giving you fever
Second time love, cooling your brow
Finally love takes your hand in the dark
And leads you home somehow

So never say never another
Just because somebody broke your heart
Get your chin off the floor
You'll never know what's in store
If you don't give love a chance to start
And if you don't believe in following feelings

It's never too late to start
Cause when you open your eyes
Then you'll realize
I'm the one who's chasing your heart

Well it's first time love, giving you fever
Second time love, cooling your brow
Finally love takes your hand in the dark
And leads you home somehow

And it's first time love making your heart beat
Second time love making it stop
Finally love picks you up from the bottom
And leads you home some how
