Everybody knows you came with him
But another girl caught his eye
(I'll take you home)
Now you're sitting there all alone watching them dance by
(I'll take you home)

And I know you're wondering
What you'll do if he doesn't come back to you
But don't worry, I'll take you home
So, little girl, don't you be blue

Now I know that you wore
That pretty red dress just for him to see
(I'll take you home)
But I wanna tell ya, that red dress looks good to me
(I'll take you home)

Whoa, I know you feel like you wanna die
But try pretending that I'm your guy
And don't worry, I'll take you home
So, little girl, now don't you cry

I'll take you home when the last dance is over
I'll take you home, just wait and see
You're gonna dance the last dance with me
Let me tell you now

I know the way that you feel, I can understand
(I'll take you home)
'Cause I had a date just like you when the dance began
(I'll take you home)

But the girl I came with just wasn't true
She's the girl who took him from you
So you see now, I'll take you home
'Cause, little girl, I'm lonely, too
Oh, let me tell you now

I know the way that you feel, I can understand
(I'll take you home)
'Cause I had a date just like you when the dance began
(I'll take you home)

But the girl I came with just wasn't true
She's the girl who took him from you
So you see now, I'll take you home
'Cause, little girl, I'm lonely, too

Whoa, I'll take you home
'Cause, little girl, I'm lonely, too
Whoa, I'll take you home
'Cause, little girl, I'm lonely, too
