Mustard on the beat, ho


Girl, as long as you, wrap your arms 'round me
Oh baby, I don't care what them people say
I'm givin' you whatever you want
Girl, you know I can provide
Whatever you need
(Whatever you need, babe)
Listen to your heart, baby


Yeah, I'm the only young nigga who's poppin' that
Got it jumpin' out the heat there like who coppin' that?
New G Wagon got her braggin', put a lock on that
Niggas always hit her DM, she don't holla back, woo, woo, copy that
Cuffin', I've been cuffin'
Chanel bags like it's nothin', and she love them
Her last nigga, he was bluffin', she said, "Fuck him"
He let that go, I'm like, "He buggin'," now she thuggin' with a real one
I've been ballin' on you 'cause you smart and loyal
All my homies know me best, they say I'm fallin' for you
And that box be slippery like tryna walk on oil
And I'll be there long as you there when I be callin' for you, facts


Girl, as long as you, wrap your arms 'round me
Oh, baby I don't care what them people say
I'm givin' you whatever you want
Girl, you know I can provide
Whatever you need
(Whatever you need, babe)
Listen to your heart, baby


Yeah, you can get whatever you want, whatever you need
Got a one way flight 'cause I ain't lettin' you leave
We ain't fuck first night, had me beggin' you please
But you love when I'm beggin', you told me get on my knees
And I ate it, we got faded
You said, "Put some Tory Lanez on" and I played it
In Philly, we say you the main joint and we save it
Finally got a rich nigga, baby, you made it
Long as you hold me down, you know that it's goin' down
Be there when I turn around and I'll turn your world around
I had to tone it down 'cause you made me slow it down
But I got you open now, so I'm 'bout to show you now, show you now


What makes you think that I would try to run a game on you?
Just as sure as my name is Dolla, I'll be there for you and I'll
Treat you just like a queen and give you fine things
You'll never have to worry 'bout another in your place, so believe me when I say


Girl, as long as you, wrap your arms 'round me
Oh, baby I don't care what them people say
I'm givin' you whatever you want
Girl, you know I can provide
Whatever you need
(Whatever you need, babe)
Listen to your heart, baby
