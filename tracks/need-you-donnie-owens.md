Need you
Your tenderness, your understanding heart
I hurt for you each minute were apart
I need my angel now

Miss you
I miss the funny little things you do
I miss your sweetness and your sadness too
I miss your every mood

When our flame of love was burning high
We vowed our love would never die
Seems your love for me has gone
I wish I knew
I hope I'm wrong

Come back to me
Come back and help me find the will to live
In this old troubled world of take and give
I need you by my side
