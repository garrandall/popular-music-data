Hey, little girl in the high school sweater
Gee, but I'd like to know you better
A-just a-swingin' yo books and chewin' gum
A-lookin' just like a juicey plum
Hey, hey-hey, hey-hey, hey, hey
Little girl

Hey, little girl in the black silk stockins
Gee, but you've got my heart a-rockin'
A-wearin' that crazy skin-tight skirt
And that crazy ivy league shirt!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, little girl

Hey little girl, can I come along
Carry your books and a-hold your arm?
I'm hopin' that you tell me, yes
Because you're the girl that I love best
Hey, hey-hey-hey

(instrumental)

A-hey-hey

Um-hm, um-hm

Ya-ya
Ya-ya, ya-ya
Ya-ya, ya-ya, ya-ya
Ya-ya, ya-ya, ya

Uuh-huh

Hey, little girl in the high school sweater
Gee, I hope you're feelin' better
Not just like the time before
'Member when you closed that door?
Hey, hey-hey, hey-hey, hey
Little girl

Hey!
A-little girl

A-hey-hey!
A-little girl

Mmm
Mmm-hm-hm
Mmm-hm-hm
Mmm-hm-hm
Yeah!

Goin' t'your house

FADES-

Well
Ya-ya-ya
Ya-ya-ya
Ya-ya-ya

Ya-ya-da-da
