Once I had a secret love
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love
Became, became impatient to be free

So I told, I told a friendly star, yeah
That way that dreamers often do
I said just, just how wonderful you are
And why, and why I'm so in love with you

Now I shout it from
The high, the highest hill
I said I even, even told
The golden daff, daffodils

I said at last, at last, at last
At last my heart's an open door
I said my love is no secret anymore

Now I shout it from
The high, highest hill
Don't you know I even went out
And I told the golden daff, daffodils

I said at last, at last, at last
At last my heart's an open door
And my love is no secret anymore
