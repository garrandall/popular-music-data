Oh little one (oh little one)
Oh little one (oh little one)
I loved her so. Ill never let her go. whoa whoa

Shes true to me (oh little one)
So true to me (oh little one)
Where will I go, if she should know
I was untrue. Oh so untrue
Made to share for every little one (oh little one)

Little one (oh little one) Oh little one (oh little one)

Break

Oh little one (oh little one)
Oh little one (oh little one)
My tears I now cry, as she walks by his side
Bye little one Goodbye little one
Oh I will die without you, little one. (oh little one)
Little one (oh little one)

Fade out
