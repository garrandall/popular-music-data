One night not long ago
I fell for you 
Too easy to let go
She was one from your past 
One of the few
You said it didn't last 

Now Romeo you know I can't believe 
Your tongue would slip so easily 
I know you think I oughta let it be 
But get it right, next time
That's the end of me 


My name is not Susan
So watch what you say 
If you still need her
Then be on your way 
Don't wanna hear about Susan
She's got nothin' on me 
So show some respect for the love you receive 
My name is not Susan 
(No, no, no, no, no -- get it right) 

Last night you were asleep
Deep in a dream 
I heard you call her name
Then you turned to embrace 
I froze in place
Never to be the same 

Now Romeo you know I never knew
My heart would bust so easily 
I know you think I oughta let it go
But get it right next time 
Say good-bye to me boy 



I never want to be the girly that you "call" one and only 
You know the kind of girly that you would call when you get lonely 
I never should have let you in, 
A damn shame -- forgot my name! 
Well, anyway 



Don't want to hear about Susan 
My name ain't Susan 
Ya better get it right!
