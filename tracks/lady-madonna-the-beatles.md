Lady Madonna
Children at your feet
Wonders how you manage to make ends meet

Who finds the money
When you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run

Lady Madonna
Baby at your breast
Ah, wonders how you manage to feed the rest

Ba-ba-ba-baaa ba-ba ba-ba-baaa
Ba-ba-ba-baaa ba-ba baaa ba-baa ba-baa
Ba-ba-ba-baaa ba-ba ba-ba-baaa
See how they run

Lady Madonna
Lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

Cause Tuesday afternoon is never ending (ba-ba-ba-baaa)
(Ba-ba ba-ba-baaa)
And Wednesday morning papers didn't come (ba-ba-ba-baaa)
(Ba-ba baaa ba-baa ba-baa)
Thursday night your stockings needed mending (ba-ba-ba-baaa)
(Ba-ba ba-ba-baaa)
See how they run

Lady Madonna
Children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet

Lady Madonna
Lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

Now, Lady Madonna
I said, baby at your breast
I wonder how you manage to feed
