I heard it on the radio
Somebody reaching out tonight
Another soul that never sleeps
Until the shadows touch the morning lights

I know you well
I've been holding on
Weak and strong
But right or wrong
I had to call your number
I had to know for sure
Whoa-whoa-whoa

Do you really wanna fall in love
Take the chance again
Do you feel inside
The fire never dies
And it burns until the end
Do you really wanna give enough
Talk all night
Make love in the rain
If you really do
All I ask of you
Remember my name
Remember my name, oh

The moment that we said hello
I could almost see your face
Two voices on a midnight phone
With nothing but time to fill the space

I know you well
And I've been holding tight
Day and night
Wrong or right
I had to call your number
I had to know for sure
Whoa-whoa-whoa

Do you really wanna fall in love
Take the chance again
Do you feel inside
The fire never dies
And it burns until the end
Do you really wanna give enough
Talk all night
Make love in the rain
If you really do
All I ask of you
Remember my name
Remember my name

Do you really wanna fall in love
Talk all night
Make love in the rain
If you really do
All I ask of you
Remember my name
Remember my name

(Do you really wanna fall in love)
Yeah, yeah
Remember my name
(Do you really wanna give enough)
Do you really
Do you really wanna fall

(Do you really wanna fall in love)
Talk all night
Make love in the rain
(Do you really wanna give enough)
Do you wanna fall in love, yeah

(Do you really wanna fall in love)
Yeah, remember my name
(Do you really wanna give enough)
Remember my name
