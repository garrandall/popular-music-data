Hey, everybody, everybody

Hey, everybody, a new dance
Has just been born
And I know you

Oh, and I've got it
So, you better get it

Listen, people

Listen to what I say
Listen people to

Cause the music will
Go right through you
And I know that
It's gonna get to you
Cause he's got it
She's got it

Oh, and I've got it
So, you better get it
I mean the Matador
Yeah, cause it's alright
Cause the music will
Go right through you
And I know that
It's gonna get to you
Cause he's got it

Oh, do the Matador
