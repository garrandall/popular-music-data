Went to the fortune teller
Had my fortune read
I didn't know what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head

Then she took a look at my palm
Said, "Son, do you feel kind of warm?"
She looked into her crystal ball
Said, "You're in love"

Said "How could that be so?"
I'm not passionate with the girls I know
She said when the next one arrives
You'll be looking into her eyes

I left there in a hurry
Looking forward to my big surprise
The next day I discovered
That the fortune teller told me lies

I hurried back down to that woman
As mad as I could be
I told her I didn't see nobody
Why'd she make a fool out of me?

Then something struck me
As if it came from up above
While looking at the fortune teller
I fell in love

Now I'm a happy fella
I'm married to the fortune teller
We're happy as we can be
Now I get my fortune told for free

Now I'm a happy fella
I'm married to the fortune teller
We're happy as we can be
Now I get my fortune told for free
