Puttin' my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that
I think I'd have a heart attack

Never put my love out on the line
Never said "Yes" to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you, I'm never good enough

When I don't care
I can play 'em like a Ken doll
Won't wash my hair
Then make 'em bounce like a basketball

But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear high heels
Yes, you make me so nervous
That I just can't hold your hand

You make me glow
But I cover up
Won't let it show
So I'm

Puttin' my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack

Never break a sweat for the other guys
When you come around, I get paralyzed
And every time I try to be myself
It comes out wrong like a cry for help

It's just not fair
Pain's more trouble than love is worth
I gasp for air
It feels so good, but you know it hurts

But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear perfume for you
Make me so nervous
That I just can't hold your hand

You make me glow
But I cover up
Won't let it show
So I'm

Puttin' my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack

The feelings got lost in my lungs
They're burning, I'd rather be numb
And there's no one else to blame (no one else)
So scared I take off and I run
I'm flying too close to the sun
And I burst into flames

You make me glow
But I cover up
Won't let it show
So I'm

Puttin' my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack (heart attack)
I think I'd have a heart attack (-tack)
Oh, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
