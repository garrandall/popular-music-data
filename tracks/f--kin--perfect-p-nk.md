Made a wrong turn
Once or twice
Dug my way out
Blood and fire
Bad decisions
That's alright
Welcome to my silly life

Mistreated
Misplaced, misunderstood
Miss "No way, it's all good"
It didn't slow me down
Mistaken
Always second guessing
Underestimated
Look, I'm still around

Pretty, pretty please
Don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than
Fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please
If you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing
You're fuckin' perfect to me

You're so mean (You're so mean)
When you talk (When you talk)
About yourself
You were wrong
Change the voices (Change the voices)
In your head (In your head)
Make them like you instead

So complicated
Look happy, you'll make it
Filled with so much hatred
Such a tired game
It's enough
I've done all I can think of
Chased down all my demons
I've seen you do the same

Oh, pretty, pretty please
Don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than
Fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please
If you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing
You're fuckin' perfect to me

The whole world's scared
So I swallow the fear
The only thing I should be drinking is an ice cold beer
So cool in line, and we try, try, try
But we try too hard and it's a waste of my time

Done looking for the critics
'Cause they're everywhere
They don't like my jeans
They don't get my hair
Exchange ourselves
And we do it all the time
Why do we do that?
Why do I do that?
Why do I do that?

Yeah
Ooh
Oh, pretty, pretty, pretty
Pretty, pretty please
Don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than
Fuckin' perfect
Pretty pretty please
If you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing
You're fuckin' perfect to me

You're perfect
You're perfect
Pretty, pretty please
If you ever ever feel
Like you're nothing
You're fuckin' perfect to me
