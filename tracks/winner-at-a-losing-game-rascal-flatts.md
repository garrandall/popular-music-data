Baby, look here at me
Have you ever seen me this way
I've been fumblin' for words
Through the tears and the hurt and the
Pain
I'm gonna lay it all out
On the line tonight
And I think that it's time
To tell this uphill fight goodbye


Have you ever had to love someone
That just don't feel the same
Tryin' to make somebody care for you
The way I do
Is like tryin' to catch the rain
And if love is really forever
I'm a winner at a losin' game

I know that baby, you tried
To find me somewhere inside of you
But you know you can't lie
Girl, you can't hide the truth
Sometimes two hearts
Just can't dance to the same beat
So I'll pack up my things
And I'll take what remains of me



I know that I'll never be the man that you need or love
Yeah, baby it's killin' me to stand here and see
I'm not what you've been dreamin' of



Oh, oh, if love is really forever
I'm a winner at a losin' game
Oh, I'm tired of losing
Oh, oh, oh-
