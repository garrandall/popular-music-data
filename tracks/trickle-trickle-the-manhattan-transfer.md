Trickle, trickle, splash, splash
Tell me how long will this rain last
The rain keeps droppin', there ain't no stoppin'
Tell me how long will this rain last

Trickle, trickle, slop, slop
Just got to see my sweet gum drop
She's there waitin' and I'm hesitatin'
Tell me just when this rain will stop

Ronnie, dig my clothes here boy
One button low
Well, you know I'm sharp, as a tack
Say can you lend me your Cadillac
Gotta go, gotta go to a party, yeah
Please lend me your short
Well if I can't take it
You know I can't make it
I won't see my baby no more

Trickle, trickle, splash, splash
Tell me how long will this rain last
The rain keeps droppin', there ain't no stoppin'
Tell me how long will this rain last

Ronnie, she's sweet, she's fine, yeah boy
And I love her so
Well if I don't make the party
Man, she sure to blow
Gotta go, gotta go to the party, yeah
Please lend me your short
Well if I can't take it, you know I can't make it
I won't see my baby no more

Trickle, trickle, splash, splash
Tell me how long will this rain last
The rain keeps droppin', there ain't no stoppin'
Tell me how long will this rain last
Trickle, trickle, slop, slop
Just got to see my sweet gum drop
She's there waitin' and I'm hesitatin'
Tell me how long will this rain last
Tell me how long will it last
