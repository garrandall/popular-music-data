Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do

You feel like summertime
You took this heart of mine
You'll be my valentine in the summer, in the summer
You are my only one
Just dancin'; having fun
Out in the shinin' sun of the summer, of the summer


Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do
I love you
Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do
Put no one else above you
Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do
I need you
Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do
Oh!
Yeah!

Kiki, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want you, and I need you
And I'm down for you always
Do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want you, and I need you
And I'm down for you always

Do love me, do love me, do
Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
Do love me, do love me, do
'Cause I need you
And I'm down for you always
Do love me, do love me, do
Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do

Cause I'm right here, ain't nobody gotta hold you
I'm right here, ain't nobody gon' control you
I'm right here, yeah yeah
Right here, right here, right here, right here, yeah

Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do
'Cause I love you
Do love me, do love me, do
You know right here, so
Kiki, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want you, and I need you
And I'm down for you always, yeah
