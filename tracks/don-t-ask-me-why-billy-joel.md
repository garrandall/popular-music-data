All the waiters in your grand cafe
Leave their tables when you blink
Every dog must have his everyday
Every drunk must have his drink


Don't wait for answers
Just take your chances
Don't ask me why


All your life you had to stand in line
Still you're standing on your feet
All your choices made you change your mind
Now your calendar's complete


Don't wait for answers
Just take your chances
Don't ask me why


You can say the human heart
Is only make-believe
And I am only fighting fire with fire
But you are still a victim
Of the accidents you leave
As sure as I'm a victim of desire


All the servants in your new hotel
Throw their roses at your feet
Fool them all but baby I can tell
You're no stranger to the street


Don't ask for favors
Don't talk to strangers
Don't ask me why


Yesterday you were an only child
Now your ghosts have gone away
You can kill them in the classic style
Now you, "parlez vous francais"


Don't look for answers
You took your chances
Don't ask me why
Don't ask me why
