Now I've been happy lately, thinking about the good things to come 
And I believe it could be, something good has begun 

I've been smiling lately, dreaming about the world as one 
And I believe it could be, something good is bound to come 

For out on the edge of darkness, there rides a peace train 
Peace train take this country, come take me home again 

Peace train sounding louder 
Ride on the peace train  
Come on the peace train 
Peace train is a holy roller 
Everyone jump upon the peace train 
This is the peace train 

Get your bags together, come bring your good friends too 
Because it's getting nearer, soon it will be with you 

Come and join the living, it's not so far from you 
And it's getting nearer, soon it will all be true 

Peace train sounding louder 
Ride on the peace train 
Come on the peace train

I've been crying lately, thinking about the world as it is 
Why must we go on hating, why can't we live in bliss 

For out on the edge of darkness, there rides a peace train 
Peace train take this country, come take me home again 

Peace train sounding louder 
Ride on the peace train
Come on the peace train 
Peace train is a holy roller 
Everyone jump upon the peace train
This is the peace train 
Come on the peace train 
Come on come on, come on 
the peace train
