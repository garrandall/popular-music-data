There's a fire startin' in my heart
Reachin' a fever pitch and it's bringin' me out the dark

Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare

See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reachin' a fever pitch and it's bringin' me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feelin'...


We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)


Baby, I have no story to be told
But I heard one on you and it's gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Makin' a home down there as mine sure won't be shared


The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feelin'...


We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it with a beatin'


Throw your soul through every open door

Count your blessings to find what you look for

Turn my sorrow into treasured gold

You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown


(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Yeah, we could have had it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Yeah, it all, it all, it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands (You're gonna wish you never had met me)

And you played and you played and you played
And you played it to the beat
