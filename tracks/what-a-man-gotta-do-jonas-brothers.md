Cut my heart about one, two times
Don't need to question the reason, I'm yours, I'm yours
I'd move the earth or lose a fight just to see you smile
'Cause you got no flaws, no flaws

I'm not tryna be your part-time lover
Sign me up for the full-time, I'm yours, all yours

So, what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta say?
What a man gotta pray?
To be your last 'Goodnight' and your first 'Good day'
So, what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta do?
What a man gotta prove?
To be totally locked up by you

You ain't tryna be wasting time
On stupid people and cheap lines, I'm sure, I'm sure
So I'd give a million dollars just for you to grab me by the collar
And knock on these doors, these doors

I'm not tryna be your part-time lover
Sign me up for the full-time, I'm yours, I'm yours, woo

So, what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta say?
What a man gotta pray?
To be your last 'Goodnight' and your first 'Good day'
So, what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta do?
What a man gotta prove?
To be totally locked up by you

Oh-ohoohhoh-ohoohhohohoh
Oh-ohoohhoh-ohoohhohohoh
Tell me what a man gotta do?

So, what a man gotta do? (What a man gotta do?)
What a man gotta do? (What a man gotta do, yeah?)
To be totally locked up by you (Totally locked up by you)
What a man gotta say? (What a man gotta say?)
What a man gotta pray? (What a man gotta pray?)
To be your last 'Goodnight' and your first 'Good day'

So, what a man gotta do? (What a man gotta do?)
What a man gotta do? (Whoa)
To be totally locked up by you (Totally locked up by you)
What a man gotta do? (Hey, baby)
What a man gotta prove? (What a man gotta prove?)
To be totally locked up by you (Totally locked up by you)
