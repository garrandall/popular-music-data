There are so many ways to love a man and so many things to understand
And if there ever comes a time you decide to change your mind
I'll need a way to hold you and I can cause I'll know all the ways to love a man
But there's so many ways to lose a man so quickly he can slip through your hands
One little thing goes wrong then all at once he's gone
I'd have no way to hold him like I planned
It takes more than just one way to love a man
With my hands my heart anything I can find my child my home my soul and my mind
I'll know that I can hold him yes I can if I know all the ways to love a man
