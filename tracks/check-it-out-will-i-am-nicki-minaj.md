Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh


St-st-step up in the party like my name was "That Bitch"
All these haters mad because I'm so established
They know I'm a beast, yeah, I'm a fucking savage
Haters, you could kill yourself (uhh)
In my space shuttle and I'm not coming down
I'm a stereo and she's just so monotone
Sometimes it just me and all my bottles all alone
I ain't coming back this time


I can't believe it, it's so amazin'
This club is heated, this party's blazin'
I can't believe it, this beat is bangin'
I can't believe it, I can't believe it
Hey, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out
Check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out
Check it out, check it out, yeah, yeah, I'm feelin' it now
Check it out, check it out, check it out


St-st-step up in the party like my name is Mr. T
All these hating naggers ain't got nat'in' on me
Honestly, I gotta stay as fly as I can be
If you licking Willy, you get super OG
Honey's always rush me 'cause I'm fly, fly, fly
Dummies they can't touch me 'cause I'm floating sky high
I stay niggerific, you don't need to ask why
You just gotta see with your eyes


I can't believe it, it's so amazin'
This club is heated, this party's blazin'
I can't believe it, this beat is bangin'
I can't believe it, I can't believe it
Hey, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out
Check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out
Check it out, check it out, yeah, yeah, I'm feelin' it now
Check it out, check it out, check it out


Check this motherfucker out!
It got me in the club, in the club just rocking like this
Oh, oh


Da-dun-dun
The sun done, yep, the sun done
Came up, but we still up in dungeon
Da-dun-dun, yep, in London
Competition? Why yes, I would love some
How the fuck they get mad 'cause their run done?
Mad 'cause I'm gettin' money in abundance?
Man, I can't even count all of these hundreds
Duffel bag every time I go to SunTrust
I leave the rest just to collect inTRUST
I mean interest, fuck my nemesis
Exclamation, just for emphasis
And I don't sympathize, 'cause you a simple bitch
I just pop up on these hoes on some pimple shit
And put the iron to your face, you old wrinkled bitch!


This, is mega nigga, u-u-ultra enigmatic
Matic, matic, matic, ma-ma-matic


Oh, we just had to kill it
We on the radio hotter than a skillet
We in the club making party people holla
Money in the bank, we be getting top dollar
I'm a big baller, you a lil smaller
Step up to my level, need to grow a lil taller
I'm a shot caller, get up off my collar
You a Chihuahua, I'm a Rottweiler


I can't believe it, it's so amazin' (yeah)
I can't believe it, this beat is bangin' (yeah)
I can't believe it, it's so amazin' (yeah)
I can't believe it, I can't believe it
Hey, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out
Check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out
Check it out, check it out, yeah, yeah I'm feelin' it now
Check it out, check it out, check it out
