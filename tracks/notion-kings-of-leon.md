I got a notion that says it doesn't feel right
Got the answer in your story today
You gave me a sign that didn't feel right

So don't knock it, don't knock it, you been here before
So don't knock it, don't knock it, you been here before

I just wanted to know if I could go home
Been rambling day after day
Everyone says they don't know

So don't knock it, don't knock it, you been there before
So don't knock it, don't knock it, you been there before

I got a notion that says it doesn't feel right
I just wanted to know if I could go home

So don't knock it, don't knock it, you been there before
So don't knock it, don't knock it, you been there before
