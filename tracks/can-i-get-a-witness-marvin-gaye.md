Listen everybody, especially you girls
Is it right to be left alone
While the one you love is never home?
I love too hard, my friends sometimes say
But I believe, I believe
That a woman should be loved that way
But it hurts me so inside
To see her treat me so unkind
Somebody, somewhere tell her it's unfair


Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
Somebody


Is it right to be treated so bad
When you've given everything you had?
Even tossing in my sleep
Because I haven't seen my baby all week


Now, you chicks do agree
That this ain't the way love's supposed to be
Let me hear, let me hear you say yeah, yeah


Up early in the morning with her on my mind
Just to find out all night that I've been crying
But I believe a woman's a man's best friend
So I'm going to stick by her until the very end
But she causes so much misery I forget how
Love is supposed to be
Somebody, somewhere, tell her it ain't fair


Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
Somebody


Everybody knows, especially you girls
Love can be sad
But I have a love that's twice as bad


Now, you chicks do agree
That this ain't the way love's supposed to be
Let me hear, let me hear you say yeah, yeah


I want a witness
I want a witness
I want a witness
I want a witness
I want a witness
