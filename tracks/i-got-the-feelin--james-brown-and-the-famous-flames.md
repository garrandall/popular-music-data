Uh huh, uh uh
I got the feeling
Baby, baby
I got the feeling

You don't know what you do to me
People are heavy, down in misery

Hey, yeah, all right, OW
Hey, hey, ah, good Lord

I got the feeling, all right

Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby

I got the feeling, baby
Baby, sometimes I'm up
Sometimes I'm down
My heart, I'm around the town
I'm level with the ground, baby
I said level with the ground

Well, baby, you treat me
You treat me bad, AH

No, no, I know
Know you don't mean it now
Sometimes I roam
But I'll be coming back home
Sometimes I seem to be fly
I just don't want you to say, "Bye, bye"

Hey, baby, uh uh uh uh...
Waaah, baby
I got that feeling, baby, can't help it
All right

Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby

Come on now
Come on now
Oh, oh, oh oh
