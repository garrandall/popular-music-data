A child can dream, but man must always remember
Drives into the cold of December
World is bittersweet, just painful perfection
And who, who can forget the memory?

Fade away, leavin' L.A.
Tomorrow's waiting, memory's fading
Take me away; don't wanna stay
Must a man always remember?

A child can hope, but a man is always waiting,
Waiting for the rains of next November
World is bittersweet, just cruel cursing
And who, who can forget the memory?

Fade away, leavin' L.A.
Tomorrow's waiting, memory's fading
Take me away; don't wanna stay
Must a man always remember?

Oh-a, fade away, leavin' L.A.
Tomorrow's waiting, memory's fading
Take me away; don't wanna stay
Must a man always remember?

Oh-a, fade away, leaving L.A.
Tomorrow's waiting, memory's fading
Take me away, don't wanna stay
Must a man always remember?
