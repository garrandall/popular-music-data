You pack your bag.
You take control.
You're moving into my heart
and into my soul.
Get out of my way!
Get out of my sight!
I won't be walking on thin
ice to get through the night.

Hey, where's your work?
What's your game?
I know your business
but I don't know your name...
Hold on tight,
you know she's a little bit dangerous.
She's got what it takes to make ends meet
the eyes of a lover that hit like heat.
You know she's a little bit dangerous.

You turn around,
so hot and dry.
You're hiding under a halo,
your mouth is alive.
Get out of my way!
Get out of my sight!
I'm not attracted to go-go deeper tonight.

Hey, what's your word?
What's your game?
I know your business
but I don't know your name...
Hold on tight...
