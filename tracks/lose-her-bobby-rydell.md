You better lose her
She's a loser
Lose her before
You lose your mind
Get a minute and you'll find
She's the aggravating kind
Just lose her
Leave her far behind

You meet a girl
And she's looking good
Stop the world like
A real man should

Just think right
She'll put you down
(Let's go to the
Swingingest club in town)



So, uh, after the club
You take her home
Folks are out
And you're all alone

She whispers
Oh, so tenderly
(You get no kisses
Till you marry me)



So after the wedding
You are settled down
With lots of in-laws
Hanging all round

And every day
She'll so softly say
(You don't love me anymore)
(You never tell me you love me anymore)
(You're nothing but a no good alley cat)

You better lose her
She's a loser
Lose her before
You lose your mind
