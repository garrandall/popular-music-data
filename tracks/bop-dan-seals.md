Put on your bobby socks baby
Roll up your old blue jeans
There's a band playing down at the armory 
That's what rock and roll really means

I wanna to ride in your 55 T-bird
Drive thru some old memories
I ain't after your body baby 
I just want you to dance with me

I wanna bop with you baby all night long
I wanna bop the night away 
I wanna make it a night like it use to be
When our hearts were young 
And our souls were free
I wanna bop with you baby all night long
I wanna be-bop baby til the break of dawn 
I wanna bop with you baby all night long

I got an old photograph in my pocket 
We were still in our teens
Lord, knows I feel a lot older now 
But you still look the same to me 

Honey, you don't ever laugh like you use to
And I don't wanna see you blue
If you may busy tonight and ya think it's all right
This is what I wanna do

I wanna bop with you baby all night long
I wanna bop the night away 
I wanna make it a night like it use to be
Oh when our hearts so young and free
I wanna bop with you baby all night long
I wanna be-bop baby til the break of dawn 
I wanna bop with you baby all night long

Lets twist and shout 
Oh, Just like in the good old days 
Baby, watch out
You know I just can't stand it 
When you look at me that way

I wanna bop with you baby all night long
I wanna be-bop baby til the break of dawn 
I wanna bop with you baby all night 
I wanna bop with you baby all night long
I wanna be-bop baby til the break of dawn 
I wanna make it a night like it use to be 
When our hearts were young 
And our souls were free

I wanna bop with you baby all night long
I wanna be-bop baby til the break of dawn 
I wanna make it a night like it use to be 
When our hearts were young and free
