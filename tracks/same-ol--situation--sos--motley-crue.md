She's got an alligator bag
Top hat to match
Dressed in black on black
She's got a Philipino girlie
She claims is her friend
I tell you boys, you just gotta laugh
Now I used to call her Cindy
She changed her name to "Sin"
I guess that's the name of her game
I really used to love her
Then, the kitty she discovered
It's got to be a sexual thing

(Pre-Chorus)
All around the world
Girls will be girls

(Chorus)
It's the same ol', same ol' situation
It's the same ol', same ol' ball and chain

I say no, no, no
No, no, no

Introduced me to her lover
In a cellophane dress
Then they bid me a sweet farewell
Last time I saw them
They were kissing so softly
To the sound of wedding bells

Well

(Pre-Chorus)


(Chorus)
No, no, no
No, no, no

(Solo)


(Chorus)
You know we just gotta say

(Pre-Chorus)
