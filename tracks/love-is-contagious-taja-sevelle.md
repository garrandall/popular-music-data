Was a girl in the rain
No one else could feel her pain
Was a boy all alone
Nothing left to call his own

Something came along
Secrets of surprise
Force of love was far too strong
Saw it in their eyes

They tried
And they tried
They tried
But they couldn`t play it off

Love is contagious
When it`s alright
Love is contagious
Love is contagious
Yeah, it`s alright
Love is contagious, yeah
Oh, oh, oh

Now they`re standing in the light
Got a love that`s sure enough tight
Kind that stops on the street
Ain`t about being discreet

Our love`s a storm in disguise
It`s alright
I couldn`t keep away if I tried
Understand
It`s in your hands

Cause I tried and I tried
I tried
But there ain`t no playing it off

Love is contagious
When it`s alright
Love is contagious
Love is contagious
Yeah, it`s alright
Love is contagious, yeah, yeah

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh oh, ah

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, ah

I tried
And I tried
I tried
But there ain`t no playing it off

Love is contagious
When it`s alright
Love is contagious
Love is contagious
Yeah, it`s alright
Love is contagious, yeah, hey

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
(Contagious)
Our love`s a storm
You can`t deny

(Contagious)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, yeah
(Contagious)
