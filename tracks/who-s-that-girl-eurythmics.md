Who's that girl?

The language of love
Slips from my lover's tongue
Cooler than ice cream
And warmer than the sun
Dumb hearts get broken
Just like china cups
The language of love
Has left me broken on the rocks

But there's just one thing
(Just one thing)
But there's just one thing
And I really wannna know

Who's that girl
Running around with you?
Tell me
Who's that girl
Running around with you?

The language of love
Has left me stony grey
Tongue tied and twisted
At the price I've had to pay
Your careless notions
Have silenced these emotions
Look at all the foolishness
Your lover's talk has done
