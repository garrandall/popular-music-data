Let's go down by the grapevine
Drink my daddy's wine, get happy
Down by the grapevine
Drink my daddy's wine, get happy

Happy, oh, sweet blindness
A little magic
A little kindness
Oh, sweet blindness
All over me

Four leaves on a clover
I'm just a bit of a shade hungover
Come on, baby, do a slow float
You're a good looking riverboat
And ain't that sweet eyed
Blindness good to me

Let's go down by the grapevine
Drink my daddy's wine, good morning
Down by the grapevine
Drink my daddy's wine, good morning

Morning, oh, sweet blindness
A little magic
A little kindness
Oh, sweet blindness
All over me

Please don't tell my mother
I'm a saloon and a moonshine lover
Come on, baby, do a slow float
You're a good lookin' riverboat
And ain't that sweet eyed
Blindness good to me

Don't ask me cause
I ain't gonna tell you
What I've been drinking
Ain't gonna tell you
What I've been drinking
Ain't gonna tell you
What I've been drinking
Wine, of wonder
Wonder by the way

Oh, sweet blindness
A little magic
A little kindness
Oh, sweet blindness
All over me

Don't let daddy hear it
He don't believe in
The gin mill spirit
Don't let daddy hear it
He don't believe in
The gin mill spirit

Come on, baby, do a slow float
You're a good looking riverboat
And ain't that sweet eyed
Blindness good to me

Blindness, sweet eyed blindness
Now ain't that sweet eyed
Blindness good to me
