Why does all the world pass me by
Why does no one hear when I cry
Why do lonely arms long for you
Why can't I believe that it's true

Now that you've gone
Gone, gone away
Gone, gone, gone away

Why is there a dawn but no day
Why do all the stars fade away
Why are shadows hiding my sun
Why do I have nowhere to run

Now that you've gone
Gone, gone away
Gone, gone, gone away

Where are all the dreams that we knew
Whoever said dreams all come true
Where are they now

Why must life go on anymore
Why do I want you more and more
Why do I go on asking why
When you'll be my love till I die

Why have you gone
Gone, gone away
Gone, gone, gone away

Where are all the dreams that we knew
Whoever said dreams all come true
Where are they now

Why must life go on anymore
Why do I want you more and more
Why do I go on asking why
When you'll be my love till I die

Why have you gone
Gone, gone away
Gone, gone, gone away
From me

Gone, gone, gone away
Gone, gone, gone away
Gone, gone, gone away
Gone, gone, gone away
