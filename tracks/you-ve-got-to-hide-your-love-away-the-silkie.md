Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feelin' two-foot small

Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away
How could I even try
I can never win

Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
Love will find a way

Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say
Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away
