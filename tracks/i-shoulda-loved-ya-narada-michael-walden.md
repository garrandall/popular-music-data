I shoulda loved ya
I shoulda loved ya
Oh when I touched ya
I shoulda loved ya

There you were, I was blinded
After love, swore I couldn't find it
A seduction grabbed my hand
Oh my body screamed but my heart just didn't understand

Life between the sheets is fine
If all you want to make this time
But if you want to make it last
Oh you'll lose control if you drive too fast

I shoulda loved ya
I shoulda loved ya
Oh when I touched ya
I shoulda loved ya

Going down for the count
Now I'm in but you are out
My memories are my obsession
Beggin' for attention, ohyeah

Apprehending all my criminal need
That stole your heart, then left you to bleed
Those days are over, baby, yes, I swear
Just say the word and I'll be there

I shoulda loved ya
I shoulda loved ya
Oh when I touched ya
It made too much of you

I shoulda loved ya
I shoulda loved ya
Oh when I touched ya
I shoulda loved ya

I shoulda loved ya
I shoulda loved ya
Oh when I touched ya
I shoulda loved ya

I shoulda loved ya
I shoulda loved ya
Oh when I touched ya
I shoulda loved ya

I shoulda loved ya
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa)
I shoulda loved ya
(I, I shoulda loved ya)
Oh when I touched ya
It made too much of you
(Yeah, ohooh

I shoulda loved ya
(Oh my baby, baby, baby, baby, babe)
I shoulda loved ya
(Said I, I shoulda loved ya)
Oh when I touched ya
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
I shoulda loved ya
(I shoulda loved ya)
