I thought it was over, baby
We said our goodbyes
But I can't go a day without your face
Going through my mind
In fact, not a single minute
Passes without you in it
Your voice, your touch, memories of your love
Are with me all of the time


Let me let go, baby
Let me let go
If this is for the best, why are you still in my heart?
Are you still in my soul?
Let me let go


I talked to you the other day
Looks like you make your escape
You put us behind, no matter how hard I try
I can't do the same


Let me let go, baby
Let me let go
It just isn't right
I've been two thousand miles
Down a dead-end road


Let me let go, darling, won't you?
I just gotta know, yeah
If this is for the best
Why are you still in my heart?
Are you still in my soul?
Let me let go


The lights of this strange city are shining
But they don't hold no fascination for me
I try to find the bright side, baby
But everywhere I look, everywhere I turn
You're all I see


Let me, let me let go, baby, won't you?
Let me let go
It just isn't right
I've been two thousand miles
Down a dead-end road


Oh, let me let go, darling, won't you?
I just gotta know
If this is for the best
Why are you still in my heart?
Yeah, you're still in my soul
Let me let go
Let me let go
Let me let go
