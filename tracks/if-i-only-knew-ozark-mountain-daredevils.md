If I only knew what wakes me

If I only knew

Then I would be outside walkin'

Through the morning dew with you

It shouldn't be too far

It shouldn't be far away, away, away

If I only knew which road went where

If I only knew

Then I would be outside walkin'

Through the morning air with you

It shouldn't be too hard

It shouldn't be hard to see, to see, to see

Hey you

Put some funny looking clothes on

Me too

Then we can run around and show our happy glow

If I only knew what it would take

If I only knew

Then I wouldn't make the same mistakes

That I usually do with you

It shouldn't be too hard

It shouldn't be hard to do, to do, to do, to do
