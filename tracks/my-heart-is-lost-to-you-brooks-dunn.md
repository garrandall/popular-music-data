Maybe it was the moonlight
The scent of you on the breeze
Maybe it was your shadow that fell over me
Such a beautiful stranger
Eyes darker than coal
Your first look crossed the desert
Into my soul

Mi Corzon perdido en ti
My heart is lost to you
You have captured my love completely
My heart is lost to you
Oh my heart is lost to you

Maybe it was the music
The way it moved with your hair
Or the heat of the moment
That hung in the air
But when I saw you there dancing
Mesmerized by the gaze
There was some kind of magic
That led me away
