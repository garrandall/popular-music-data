Got a guitar
Got a guitar on my back
And I'm standin' on this lonesome railroad track
Train's a comin'
It'll be here 'fore too long
But I don't think I can stop it with a song

Girl that's kind of the way I'm feelin'
Tryin' to stop your leavin'

Got a pebble
Got a pebble in my hand
And I toss it out into the middle of the Rio Grande
But the river keeps a runnin'
Don't even know that I'm around
I could throw in a million more and not slow it down

Girl that's kind of the way I'm feelin'
Tryin' to stop your leavin'

There's nothin' I wouldn't try
If I thought it would change your mind

But you don't love me
You don't love me anymore
And I know as soon as you walk out that door
Train's a comin'
River's runnin'
Train's a comin', river's runnin'
Pain's a comin', tears are runnin'

Yeah that's kind of the way I'm feelin'
Knowin' I couldn't stop your leavin'
