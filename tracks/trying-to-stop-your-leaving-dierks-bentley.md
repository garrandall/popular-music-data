Got a guitar
Got a guitar on my back
And I'm standing on this lonesome railroad track
Train's a-coming
It'll be here 'fore too long
But I don't think I can stop it with a song

Girl, that's kind of the way I'm feelin'
Trying to stop your leaving

Got a pebble
Got a pebble in my hand
And I toss it out into the middle of the Rio Grande
But the river keeps running
Don't even know that I'm around
I could throw in a million more and not slow it down

Girl, that's kind of the way I'm feeling
Trying to stop your leaving

There's nothing I wouldn't try
If I thought it would change your mind

But you don't love me
No, you don't love me anymore
And I know as soon as you walk out that door
Train's a-coming
River's running
Train's a-coming, river's running
Pain's a-coming, tears are running

And that's kind of the way I'm feeling
Knowing I couldn't stop your leaving
