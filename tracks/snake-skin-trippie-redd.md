Ayy
Bitch so bad with the snakeskin, ayy
Foreign do the dash, you know I'm racin'
All my racks the fuckin' same, yeah they adjacent, huh
All them motherfuckers is blue faces
Made a lot of fuckin' millions off the pavement
And it took a lot of patience and waitin', anxious

Ayy, foreign suicide, wrist suicide, neck suicide, car suicide, doors suicide
Don't commit no suicide
Say no to suicide, suicide, suicide
Suicide watch (Watch)
These niggas gon' kill theyselves they see me stuntin' (Stuntin')
These niggas gon' kill theyselves they see me makin' money (Makin' money)
Please nigga don't kill yourself, say no to suicide

Don't, die on me, say no to suicide
Don't, die on me, say no to suicide
Don't, die on me, say no to suicide
Don't try on me (Die on me)

Don't, I'll slide out with you, uh
Slime out with troops, uh
Pussy nigga talk down then we slide I'm like woo, huh
Shine then I grind throw the dime like a hoop, ay
Bad bitch and her ass is obtuse but that stomach is acute, uh
Nigga what it do?
Big red counting blue, huh, we like wonton soup
With your bitch like two, tweety birds in a coupe
Ah wait
Bitch so bad with the snake skin, ay
Foreign do the dash, you know I'm racin' ay
All my racks the same, yeah they adjacent
All them motherfuckers is some blue faces, ay
All my racks I made them off the pavement, patience, waitin'

Ay, foreign suicide, wrist suicide, neck suicide
Car suicide, doors suicide
Don't commit no suicide
Say no to suicide, suicide, suicide
Suicide watch (Watch)
These niggas gon' kill theyselves they see me stuntin' (Stuntin')
These niggas gon' kill theyselves they see me makin' money (Makin' money)
Please nigga don't kill yourself, say no to suicide

Don't, die on me, say no to suicide
Don't, die on me, say no to suicide
Don't, die on me, say no to suicide
Don't try on me (Die on me)
