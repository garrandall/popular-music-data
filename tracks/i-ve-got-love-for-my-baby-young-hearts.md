I,I,I ... I wasnt ready 


Wen u talked about our future 
U would nod ya head and smile
But I didnt understand it 
I was living in denile
I couldnt see tha picture
But now I see it clearer 
Cause I was so young
And now that I could get cha
I wanted ta be wit cha 
What have I become


(I,I .. I wasnt ready)
This is game that ive playin cause (I,I .. I wasnt ready)
I neva gave u ma all wen I had ur trust (I,I .. I wasnt ready)
But I put this on everything that I love
One more chance so we could make up
Wish it coulda worked back then
But the truth is I wasnt ready (I,I .. I wasnt ready) 


Momma told me bout excuses
She'd say that there no use to say
Watchu would have done but did it 
I had to learn the hard way
Now that its over
I wanted to jus hold u 
But I kno I cant
I'm tryna be a soldier
I wanna do it over
Give me one more chance (I,I .. I wasnt ready)


(I,I .. I wasnt ready)
This is game that ive playin cause (I,I .. I wasnt ready)
I neva gave u ma all wen I had ur trust (I,I .. I wasnt ready)
But I put this on everything that I love
One more chance so we could make up
Wish it coulda worked back then
But the truth is I wasnt ready (I,I .. I wasnt ready)


Can I get a re-do baby
Cause u no I need u baby
And now I'm ready for ur love, ur love
I jus wanna see u baby
Jus wanna smell and breathe u baby (your so beautiful mami)
Cause I hate what we`ve become (yeah) 
I wasnt ready for ur love


Yo I waited I contemplated and then I did it
There was room for relationship but pretty had to hit it
We like hand in glove, a head to a yankee fitted
Game is responsibily, its all how u spit it (betta yet live it)
Cause karma is a tru adventure 
Sorta like a ninga or king and all his splender
Remember love can be as cold as decemeber
Unless its in its truest form I could neva end ya
Can break or make u, see my vision cuz I noe eventually
Ull see my vision by the way I'm livin (this is a given)
I'm given u my heart I'm givin u my soul I'm givin u my gold 
I'm sorry for the dirt that I did 
Sneakin broads in and out tha crib
Tha double life I lived
They say a fool sells dreams
But a man makes dreams come tru
Mami I changed all for the love of u


(I,I wasnt ready) 
This is game that ive playin cause (I,I .. I wasnt ready)
I neva gave u ma all wen I had ur trust (I,I .. I wasnt ready)
But I put this on everything that I love
One more chance so we could make up
Wish it coulda worked back then
But the truth is I wasnt ready
(I,I .. I wasnt ready)
(I,I .. I wasnt ready)

(I,I .. I wasnt ready)
(I,I .. I wasnt ready)


Wish it coulda worked back then, damn ...
