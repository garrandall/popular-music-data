Tender was the night
Took an early flight
Rushing' home tonight
Something' wasn't right
I can't believe my eyes
I know I must be dreaming.


Did I come home too late, too son
You in his arms told me the truth
Too late, too soon.

I wish I would have known
I wouldn't have left you all alone
Temptation led you wrong
Tell me how long has this been going on
Cause I thought our love was strong
I guess I must be dreaming.


Did I come home too late, too son
You in his arms told me the truth
Too late, too soon.

What was I supposed to do
You had to see it for yourself
Cause I thought our love was strong
I guess I must be dreaming.
