Them jeans are faded
In all the right places
You got me hanging on tight to your curves like little E races
Girl your funky little back beat has got me
Feel like I'm tipsy
And I ain't even had a drink

I wanna kiss you in the parking lot
Under the moonlight
Kiss you running red lights
Baby set the mood right
Just like everything you're doing to me right now's
Making me crazy
I wanna kiss you on the dance floor
Kiss you like a let's go, come on
Baby let me hear you say oh, oh
I wanna kiss you with the neon lights in your eyes glowing
Then I wanna kiss you in the morning
Yeah I wanna kiss you in the morning

Oh you little outlaw
Stealing my heart and all
When you drop it down low
Touch your toes girl
You know you just show it off
That little tattoo on your tan line, oh my
Pretty little butterfly
What else have you got to hide?

I wanna kiss you in the parking lot
Under the moonlight
Kiss you running red lights
Baby set the mood right
Just like everything you're doing to me right now's
Making me crazy
I wanna kiss you on the dance floor
Kiss you like a let's go, come on
Baby let me hear you say oh, oh
I wanna kiss you with the neon lights in your eyes glowing
Then I wanna kiss you in the morning
Yeah I wanna kiss you in the morning

I wanna kiss you in the parking lot
Under the moonlight
Kiss you running red lights
Baby set the mood right
Just like everything you're doing to me right now's
Making me crazy
I wanna kiss you on the dance floor
Kiss you like a let's go, come on
Baby let me hear you say oh, oh
I wanna kiss you with the neon lights in your eyes glowing
Then I wanna kiss you in the morning
Yeah I wanna kiss you in the morning, morning
Yeah I wanna kiss you in the morning
