I'll be with you in apple blossom time
I'll be with you to change your name to mine
One day in May, I'll come and say
Happy the bride the sun shines on today

What a wonderful wedding there will be
What a wonderful day for you and me
Church bells will chime, you will be mine
In apple blossom time

I'll be with you in apple blossom time
I'll be with you to change your name to mine
One day in May, I'll come and say
Happy the bride the sun shines on today

What a wonderful wedding there will be
What a wonderful day for you and me
Church bells will chime, you will be mine
In apple blossom time
