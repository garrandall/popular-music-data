New Boyz!


Don't say a word just turn around and let me see
Girl you got some'n special, some'n special for me?
It's way too many suckers in the V.I.P.
Tell her got my car out front, tell me do you wanna kick it
in the backseat - I wanna get beside ya
In the backseat - so I can be yo' backseat driver
In the backseat - I-I-I-I wanna get beside ya
In the backseat - so I can be yo' backseat driver


You see them girls with them high heels they got this party poppin
This ain't no country club we 'bout to get this party rockin
You got girls that's with the band let's get on top and let me see it though
Wait not in here we outta here, jump in my vehicle
Camaro long shift, she just tryin to fit comfortably
She like my orange Camaro, she said let's ride up and trick or treat
Like damn girl, damn girl, you fucks'n with the man girl
Like damn girl, damn girl, you fucks'n with the man girl




Yo! Ay girl whassup? All of this dancin gets you off, huh?
I noticed you because yo' friends is freakin star struck
and you got mo' of that, how you say it? Shy swag
Until you get it low, quit playin with yo' fine ass
I said don't try me baby, I'll make you hot trick
Let's do like Fishberg dancin, and shake this spot quick
Oh you a good girl, it's cool I play pretend too
I heard you had a baby, you want a New Boy in you?

I met a group of girls in a Escalade
I met a group of girls in a Escalade
Met a-met a group of girls in a Escalade
They came wit'chu and left with me

Ha!
