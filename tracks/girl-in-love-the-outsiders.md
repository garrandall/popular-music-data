GIRL IN LOVE
The Outsiders

Girl in love dressed in white
Crying crying on her wedding night
The gown of lace hung on a chair
The pretty gown she'll never wear
Never wear
There were no vows no vows today
Her lover her lover is far away
The chapel bells will never ring
Of her love or a wedding ring
Wedding ring
Vows so tender never never said
Only tears to fill her heart instead
Her gown of lace hung on a chair
Her love last night was sitting there
The pretty gown she'll never wear
Her love left her standing there
Standing there

(Instumental interlude and end)
