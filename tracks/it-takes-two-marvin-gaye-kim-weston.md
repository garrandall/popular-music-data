One can have a dream, baby
And two can make that dream so real
One can talk about being in love
Two can say how it really feels

One could wish upon a star
And two can make that wish come true
One can stand alone in the dark
Two can make that light shine through

It takes two, baby
It take two, baby
It takes two
It just takes two

One can have a broken heart
Livin' in misery
Two can really ease the pain
Like a perfect remedy

Oh, one can really be alone in a crowd
Like an island he's all alone
Two can make it just any place
Just like being home

It takes two, baby
It take two, baby
It takes two
It just takes two

Oh, one can go out to a movie
Looking for a special treat
Two can make that single movie
Something kinda, kinda sweet, yeah

One can take a walk in the moonlight
Thinking that it's really nice
Oh but two walking hand in hand
Like adding just a pinch of spice

It takes two, baby
It take two, baby
It takes two
It just takes two
