Ev'ry day I listen to the surging tide,
And I always wonder why the sea's so wide;
Miles of salty water, endless skies above,
Stretch out far between me and the one I love.

Rockin' rollin' ocean,
With your briny foam,
Bring my sweetheart back to me,
Bring my darling home.

Ev'ry night I wander down beside the sea,
Callin' to the wind to blow her back to me;
Now my arms are empty, since she sailed away,
Only stars to hear me when I kneel and pray.

Little drops of water, little grains of sand,
Make a wide, wide ocean in a lonely land;
When a new ship anchors and she don't appear,
I make the ocean wider with another tear.
