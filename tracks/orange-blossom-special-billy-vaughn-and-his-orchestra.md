Look a-yonder comin'
Comin' down that railroad track
Hey, look a-yonder comin'
Comin' down that railroad track

It's the Orange Blossom special
Bringin' my baby back

Well, I'm going down to Florida
And get some sand in my shoes
Or maybe California
And get some sand in my shoes

I'll ride that Orange Blossom special
And lose these New York blues

Hey, talk about a-ramblin'
She's the fastest train on the line
Talk about a-travellin'
She's the fastest train on the line

It's that Orange Blossom special
Rollin' down the seaboard line
