Boy, I've been thinkin' 'bout you, for quite a while
You're on my mind everyday and every night
My every thought is you, the things you do
Seems so satisfying to me, I must confess it, boy


Ooh, and I like it
You send chills up my spine every time I take one look at you
Ooh, and I like it
Boy, you're blowin' my mind with the things you say to me


I like the way you comb your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
It's just the little things you do
That show how much you really care
Like when I'm all alone with you
You know exactly what to do
You put that fire inside of me
And make it more than just a dream


Ooh, and I like it
You send chills up my spine every time I take one look at you
Ooh, and I like it
Ooh, and I like it


Boy, let me run this by you, just one more time
You're on my mind every day and every night
My every thought is you, the things you do
Seems so satisfying to me, I must confess it, girl





 (4)
I like it, I like it, I really, really like it
I'm for it, adore it, so come let me enjoy it


(Ooh, and I like it)
Ooh, I like it, ooh
(Ooh, and I like it)
I'm just tryin' to satisfy you, boy
You know I really like it
Hey babe
I like everything little thing you do
The way you comb your hair
And every little thing you do
It shows how much you care
Sing it babe!
Every time I take one look at you
I get chills up and down my spine

And I like it, I like it, and I like it
And I like it, and I like it
Like it, like it, like it, like it
Like it, like it, like it, baby
