There's a storm across the valley, clouds are rolling in
The afternoon is heavy on your shoulders
There's a truck out on the four lane, a mile or more away
The whining of his wheels just makes it colder

He's an hour away from riding on your prayers up in the sky
And ten days on the road are barely gone
There's a fire softly burning, supper's on the stove
But it's the light in your eyes that makes him warm

Hey, it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again

There's all the news to tell him, how'd you spend your time
And what's the latest thing the neighbors say?
And your mother called last Friday, "Sunshine" made her cry
And you felt the baby move just yesterday

Hey, it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again

Oh, the time that I can lay this tired old body down
And feel your fingers feather soft upon me
The kisses that I live for, the love that lights my way
The happiness that living with you brings me

It's the sweetest thing I know of, just spending time with you
It's the little things that make a house a home
Like a fire softly burning and supper on the stove
The light in your eyes that makes me warm

Hey, it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again

Hey, it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again
I said hey, it's good to be back home again
