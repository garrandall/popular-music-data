Find yourself another girl
Who will love you
True, true, true
Find yourself another girl

Save her love and
Kisses just for you
Save her love and
Kisses just for you

Well, the very first
Time I fell in love
Got my heart broken there

People would say
When I passed their way
There's a hurt young man
Going there, going there
An unhappy lad going there

Well, one day my mother
Called me to her side
Son, why are you so blue
Mother, I've lost
The girl that I love

Why don't you
Tell me what to do
Mother, won't you
Tell what to do

Well, she said
Find yourself another girl
Who will love you
True, true, true
Find yourself another girl

Save her love and
Kisses just for you
Who'll save her love
And kisses just for you

I can imagine
How you feel, my son
But throw it out
Of your mind

I'm gonna tell you
Kind of truthfully
True love is hard
To find sometimes
It's kinda hard to find

But forget about that girl
That broke your heart
And try to start anew

For if there was a guy for her
There's got to be a
Girl somewhere for you
Got to be a girl
Somewhere for you

You just go on and
Find yourself another girl
Who will love you
True, true, true
Find yourself another girl

Who'll save her love
And kisses just for you
Save all her love
For nobody but you

Well, oh oh
Another love
Oh, oh another love...
