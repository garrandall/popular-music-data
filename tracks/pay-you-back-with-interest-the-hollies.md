Too many people need me
I've got so much, So much to do
But when my travelling is over
I'll pay you back with interest
I'll pay you back with interest

It seems unfair to leave you
And sell myself the way I do
But when my wandering is over
I'll pay you back with interest
I'll pay you back with interest

Most of my life I've been moving
And when I tire out I'll come home to you
But until then I'll be waiting
I'll pay you back with interest
I'll pay you back with interest

How cold is my room, (How cold is my room)
Without your love beside me
We look at the same old moon (Looking at the moon)
But you're not here beside me
I'll pay you back with interest
I'll pay you back with interest



Too many people need me
I've got so much, So much to do
But when my travelling is over
I'll pay you back with interest
I'll pay you back with interest
