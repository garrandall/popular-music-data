Life was great,
Wouldn't change a thing,
I had it all but with you I had more,
But out of nowhere out of the blue,
Our love turned into a war
Now you're gone, you moved on
And I hate the way I'm feeling.

Now the only way I know that I can get you off my mind,
To keep a bottle so close, try to leave it all behind.
And I couldn't get enough
Girl, I'm drowning drunk in love
I used to think you'd never say it's over, I used to love you sober
I used to love you sober

I'm on the floor cursing at the door
Broken hearted with a pounding head
And I know I got to let you go
So the liquor helps me forget,
Your name, Your face
This pain I can't erase

Now the only way I know that I can get you off my mind,
To keep a bottle so close, try to leave it all behind.
And I couldn't get enough
Girl, I'm drowning drunk in love
I used to think you'd never say it's over, I used to love you sober
I used to love you sober

Now you're gone, You moved on
And I hate the way I'm feeling
Now the only way I know that I can get you off my mind,
To keep a bottle so close, try to leave it all behind.
And I couldn't get enough
Girl, I'm drowning drunk in love
I used to think you'd never say it's over, I used to love you sober
I used to love you sober
