Can you hear me out there
Have you ever had someone who loved you
Never leave your side
I know you'll be here
Because you love me... yes you do

I'm givin all my life and all my love... if you...
Promise that you'll be here forever
I'll give you all of me I'll give you everything
If you promise you'll never leave me

What my friends say don't matter
You'll be right here from the start
And I'll get on my knees
I'll give you all of me
If you never leave my side
Because

You love me
You complete me
You hold my heart in your hands
And it's okay cause I trust that
You'll be the best man that you can

Baby you love me... oh yes you do... yea...

And no matter what they ever say about you
I'm gonna stay by your side
Promise me no matter what they say about me
That... you're gon' be here til the end of time
Cause you held me down when no body was around
And gave me all the love I need
So give me more don't you ever leave
Cause you complete me

I know...
You love me
You complete me
You hold my heart in your hands
And it's okay cause I trust that
You'll be the best man that you can

Cause you...
Give me my heart back
Give me my love back baby
I want it all
Because it's never enough
Give me my heart
Give me my love back, baby
I want it all
Because
It's never enough

You love me
You complete me
You hold my heart in your hands
And it's okay cause I trust that
You'll be the best man that you can

You love me
You complete me
You hold my heart in your hands
And it's okay cause I trust that
You'll be the best man that you can

And it's okay...
I know you do you... I know you do.
Yes you do... I need you too... yeaahh. I love you baby (ohhh)
