Only you know and I know
All the loving we've got to show
So don't refuse to believe it
By reading too many meanings

'Cause you know that I mean what I say so don't go
And never take me the wrong way
You know you can't go on getting your own way
'Cause if you do, it's gonna get you someday, yeah.

We're both here to be pleasing
Oh no, not deceiving
But it's  hard to believe in, aw yeah
When you've been so mistreated.

'Cause you know that I mean what I say so don't go
And never take me the wrong way
You know you can't go on getting your own way
'Cause if you do, it's gonna get you someday.

If I seem to mislead you
It's just my craziness coming through
But when it comes down to just two
Aw, I ain't no crazier than you

'Cause you know that I mean what I say so don't go
And never take me the wrong way
You know you can't go on getting your own way
'Cause if you do, it's gonna get you someday.

Only you know and I know
Only you know and I know
Only you know and I know, oh yeah
Only you know and I know, oh yeah, get up
