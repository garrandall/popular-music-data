(Hey love...hey love)


Hey love (Hey love)
May I have a word with you? (Hey love)
I'd like to tell you, yeah (Hey love)
Just what I've been going through (Hey love)
My nights are so long
As I watch each hour go by
Hoping and praying
That someday I will be your guy


Hey love
You're my one true soul desire
Hey love, baby
Can you feel this burning fire?


Hey love (Hey love)
There's one thing I find so true (Hey love)
When you are near me (Hey love)
I go through a change or two (Hey love)
Hearing your footsteps
I hurry to catch your eye
And I stand there waiting, yeah
But girl, you just walk on by


Say love
With a cold heart you are dealing
Hey love, yeah yeah
It's an awful hurting feeling


Hey love (Hey love)
Don't pass me without some sign (Hey love)
Just look me over, yeah yeah (Hey love)
You might want to change your mind
