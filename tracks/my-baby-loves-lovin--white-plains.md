My baby love (loves)
My baby loves lovin'
She's got what it takes and she knows how to use it
My baby love (loves)
My baby loves lovin'
She's got what it takes and she knows how to use it

I was lonely once in this great big world
Just a nowhere man without a girl
Came that lucky day when she came my way
But she smiled at me as if to say

Your baby love (loves)
Your baby loves lovin'
She's got what it takes and she knows how to use it
My baby love (loves)
My baby loves lovin'
She's got what it takes and she knows how to use it

She's the only one make me feel so good
Can't believe my luck, so I knock on wood
All my sorrow and fears seem to fly away
When she looks at me as if to say

Your baby love (loves)
Your baby loves lovin'
She's got what it takes for me

No more lonely nights just waiting for the telephone to ring
No more lonely days my baby's taken care of everything
I'm telling you people

Mט נaby love (loves)
My baby loves lovin'
She's got what it takes and she knows how to use it
My baby love (love)
My baby loves lovin'
She's got what it takes and she knows how to use it

She's the only one make me feel so good
Can't believe my luck, so I knock on wood
All my sorrow and fears seem to fly away
When she looks at me as if to say

Your baby love (loves)
My baby loves lovin'
She's got what it takes and she knows how to use it
My baby love (loves)
My baby loves lovin'
She's got what it takes and she knows how to use it

My baby love (loves)

She's got what it takes and she knows how to use it
She's got what it takes
And she know how to use it...
