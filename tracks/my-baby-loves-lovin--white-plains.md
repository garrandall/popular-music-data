You're my sugar sugar
No hooker hooker
But I love how you grind on me
When I pull up pull up
With my hood up hood up
Tell her jump in the ride for free

And I know when I step up in the dance uh
I know you got your eyes on me
And I love the way you're moving up your bumper
I love the way you grind on me

Yeah I think I found my sweet one
And I always move correctly when I see one
I was chillin' with some fakes I had to leave some
Now I got you by my side I'm gonna keep you
Cah I need you, you're a sweet one
And I always move correctly when I see one
I was chillin' with some fakes I had to leave some
Now I got you by my side I'm gonna keep you
Cah I need you

I be thinkin' bout my baby yeah she badder than bad
Got me checkin' up her snap she's in a Addison cab
Her, plain white T got her matchin' the vans
But me, you and beef weren't part of the plan
Don't worry bout these other girls close to me
Straight pick up, pick up when you're phoning me
I ain't seen you in a second got a slow DB
When I'm boppin' through my city they be noticing me, damn
You be stressin' now you vexin' but I know you feel me
When she in pain and she text me "Jay can you just come and heal me"
Always beefin' I said I'm leavin' I told her "we'll see"
Bed sheets all bold and yeah it's looking silky
And I told you you're the one that I like
I know you feel some type of way when I just look in your eyes
And I'll give you couple cuddles when I'm back from my night
When I make more money we'll be catchin' these flights

But you know that I'm tryna make my paper
You know I'm tryna make my bread
And I don't really listen to these haters
And I don't really need new friends
And when I call her I'm telling her to come through
So we can chill on a king size bed
And I'm really loving how the way your bum move
When I touchy, touchy you're vex

You're my sugar sugar
No hooker hooker
But I love how you grind on me
When I pull up pull up
With my hood up hood up
Tell her jump in the ride for free

And I know when I step up in the dance uh
I know you got your eyes on me
And I love the way you're moving up your bumper
I love the way you grind on me

Yeah I think I found my sweet one
And I always move correctly when I see one
I was chillin' with some fakes I had to leave some
Now I got you by my side I'm gonna keep you
Cah I need you, you're a sweet one
And I always move correctly when I see one
I was chillin' with some fakes I had to leave some
Now I got you by my side I'm gonna keep you
Cah I need you

All them baby boys are foolish they ain't touchin' my bae
And if you ever fall apart then they ain't takin' my place
I'm just puffin' on that loud and now she rubbing my waves
My n*ggas always comin' saucy got me uppin' my game
And I like the way you movin' girl I'm lovin' that back
We be chillin' in the crib and now she kissin' my tats
Baby alays lookin' saucy when I'm finna to mash
I be beatin' up her shh cah the kid never lacks

You're my sugar sugar
No hooker hooker
But I love how you grind on me
When I pull up pull up
With my hood up hood up
Tell her jump in the ride for free

And I know when I step up in the dance uh
I know you got your eyes on me
And I love the way you're moving up your bumper
I love the way you grind on me

Yeah I think I found my sweet one
And I always move correctly when I see one
I was chillin' with some fakes I had to leave some
Now I got you by my side I'm gonna keep you
Cah I need you, you're a sweet one
And I always move correctly when I see one
I was chillin' with some fakes I had to leave some
Now I got you by my side I'm gonna keep you
Cah I need you
