Well, you took me for a ride
You beat me to the gun
And from the other side
Well, you came undone

But when you tell me to
I want to give in
Just like you want me to
Oh-oh, I'm falling through

Oh, you better strap me in
All night long
You got to strap me in
All night long
Got to strap me in
All night long
All, all, all night long

Well, you took me by the way
And you showed me what is fun
Just like a ricochet
Uh, back you come

And when you tell me to
I want to give it
Just like you want me to
Oh-oh, I'm falling through

Uh, you better strap me in
All night long
You better strap me in
All night long
You better strap me in
All night long
All, all, all night long

Oh baby

Well, you took me for a ride
Uh, you beat me to the gun
And from the other side
Oh well, you came undone

And when you tell me to
I want to give in
Just like you want me to
Oh-oh, I'm falling through

Oh, better strap me in
All night long
You better strap me in
All night long
Strap me in
All night long
All, all

Well, you better strap me in (strap me in)
Well, strap me in
All night long
Strap me in
All, all

Oh, strap me in
All night long

Strap me in
All, all

Oh, strap me in
All night long
