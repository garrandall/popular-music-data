I like blue eyes, hers are green
Not like the woman of my dreams
And her hair's not quite as long as I had planned
Five foot three isn't tall
She's not the girl I'd pictured at all
In those paint by number
Fantasies I've had

So it took me by complete suprise
When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes
She's not at all what I was lookin for, she's more

No, it wasn't at first sight
But the moment I looked twice
I saw the women I was born to love
Her laughter filled my soul
When I hold her I don't wanna let go
When it comes to her, I can't get enough

So it took me by complete suprise
When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes
She's not at all what I was lookin for, she's more!

More than I dreamed of
More than any man deserves...and I couldn't
Ask for a more than a love like hers

So it took me by complete suprise
When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes
She's not at all what I was lookin for, she's more
