I knew the minute that I picked you up
It was gonna be a wild ride
You kissed me like you couldn't get enough
Barely made it out of your drive
Burn a little rubber at the red light
Got a little warnin' from the blue lights
It's only going on 9 o'clock but
Feels more like midnight

We ain't even turned up the radio
Ain't been two miles down the road
The way you look at me baby I don't know
If we even gonna make it to the party
Yeah we got a whole lotta moonlight left
Already havin' the time of our lives
And we just gettin' started tonight

Girl you already got the window down
And you got your seat laid back
Ain't even make it halfway to town
And you're already talkin' 'bout a six pack
Already got your shoes off
And you're talkin' 'bout slippin' off
Nah we ain't even found your friends
And you already wanna get lost

We ain't even turned up the radio
Ain't been two miles down the road
The way you look at me baby I don't know
If we even gonna make it to the party
Yeah we got a whole lotta moonlight left
Already havin' the time of our lives
And we just gettin' started tonight

Ain't had a drink and I'm tore up
Ain't even had a taste of your love
But girl the crazy thing is
We just gettin' warmed up

We ain't even turned up the radio
Ain't been two miles down the road
The way you look at me baby I don't know
If we even gonna make it to the party
Yeah we got a whole lotta moonlight left
Already havin' the time of our lives
And we just gettin' started tonight
And we just gettin' started tonight
