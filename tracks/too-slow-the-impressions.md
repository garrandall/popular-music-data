You're too slow
Woman, you're too slow
Ain't got much time
Tell me you're mine
Woman, you're too slow

Done messed up my mind
Tryin' to figure on love
From you all I found
You're waiting around
Woman, you're too slow

You're too slow
Woman, you're too slow
Ain't got much time
Tell me you love me
Woman, you're too slow

I got a woman
My woman, she's too slow
Keeps me in pain
And it's a dog-gone shame
A woman can be too slow

Everybody's sayin'
Woman, you're too slow
You're gone dead and buried
Before we get married
Woman, you're too slow

You're too slow!
You're too slow
You're too slow!
You're too slow
You're too slow!
You're too slow
