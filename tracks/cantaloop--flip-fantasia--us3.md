Ladies and Gentlemen, as you know we have something special down here at Birdland this evening
A recording for Blue Note Records

What's that? Yeah...yeah...yeah
Funky, funky
How 'bout a big hand now
Wait, wait a minute

Groovy groovy jazzy funky pounce bounce dance as we
Dip in the melodic sea, the rhythm keeps flowin', and drips to MC
Sweet sugar pop sugar pop rocks it pop
Ya don't stop 'til the sweet beat drops
I show and prove as I stick and move
Vivid poems recited on top of the groove
Smooth, my, floating like a butterfly
Notes set afloat, sung like a lullaby
Brace yourself as the beat hits ya
Dip trip, flip fantasia

(Yeah...yeah...yeah...What's that?)
Itty bitty bop (Yeah)
Itty bitty bop (Funky, funky)

Feel the beat drop, jazz and hip hop
Drippin in your dome, makes you zone and bop
Funk and fusion, a fly illusion
Keeps ya coastin' on the rhythm you're cruisin'
Up down, round and round, rhymes profound
But nevertheless ya gots to get down
Fantasy freak thru the beat so unique
Ya move your feet, the sweat from the heat
Back to the fact I'm the mack and I know that
The way I kick the rhymes, some would call me a poet
Poems steady flowin', growin', showin' sights and sound
Caught in the groove in Fantasia I'm found
Trip the tour upon the rhymes they soar
To an infinite height to the realm of the hardcore
Here we go off I take ya
Dip trip, flip fantasia

(Yeah...yeah...yeah...What's that?)
Itty bitty bop (Yeah)
Itty bitty bop (Funky, funky)

(Yeah...yeah...yeah...What's that?)
(Yeah...yeah...yeah...Funky, funky)

Jump to the jam, boogie woogie jam slam
Bust the dialect, I'm the man in command
Come flow with the sounds of the mighty mic master
Rhyming on the mic, I'm bringing suckas their disaster
Beaucoup ducs but I still rock Nike
With the razzle dazzle, star I might be
Scribble drabble scrabble on the microphone I babble
As I flip the funky words, into a puzzle
Yes yes yes, on and on as I flex
Get with the flow, words manifest
Feel the vibe from here to Asia
Dip trip, flip fantasia
Out
