Life, it appears to be pointless in the hands of the hopeless, oh you got the answers huh.
Indeed, know please find your freedom in the releasing of your mind,
I have food for you to dine and even cheese to go with that wine I am sending you to greater places where their is access to the joys in this world you can find know, please come I can assist you as you unwind.
See, I was told like a ticket to ride that it would be you that would sell you this ticket to life that all that follows you would truly rot and die ...

I'm drifting y'all, I'm losing my patience
I wish He could take it all away, I feel I can't take it,
cause I've been up in it so long, my heart is racing, I wish you could take it all away

Take it all away, Take it all away
Take it all away, Take it all away
Take it all away, Take it all away
Take it all away, Take it all away

I don't know what to do with myself
I'm sick of being frustrated
And I know you want to help
But it ain't nothing you can do to save me
I can't help myself
I'm Sick of being aggravated
I don't know who to tell
Oh Lord, I can't, can't take it

Sometimes I imagine to off me
Drink a bottle of belvedere forgetting what God thinks, What y'all think?
I'm already on it what y'all bring?
I'm just trippen about it, but naw really come on shrink! hate life
I'm tired of eating lemons it ain't nice
I thought I got up and left but abandonment ain't right
Left right left right, I'm sick and I can't quite
Put away the inner heathen in me but I can't fight
I'm weak, vomit all of my food I can't eat
I'm in need of putting rest in the Lord but I can't sleep, I'm falling off of the bed in the night and I can't dream
Ever wake in the middle of night but can't speak? Paralyzed like a paraplegic now a what am I
Possessed depressed sick or just stressed I can't hide it
I tried to cover the heart the on my sleeve but it keeping finding a way to come out and play so bump it just keep riding
Tick-tock tickity hear the tick on my wrist watch, Time is running and gunning
Don't you run off from me punk
Making me take a pill when I wake up bump that Run in the yard with it with the Tims and stump that, So run it
I'm a little emotional with it hoping I finding God any minute
The devil he got me spinning I'm feeling invincible and invisible am I trippen I figured I'm living all in my head but I'm here lifted woah!

I'm drifting y'all, I'm losing my patience
I wish He could take it all away, I feel I can't take it,
cause I've been up in it so long, my heart is racing, I wish you could take it all away. Take it all away

I don't know what to do with myself
I'm sick of being frustrated
And I know you want to help
But it ain't nothing you can do to save me
I can't help myself
I'm sick of being aggravated
I don't know who to tell
Oh lord, I can't, can't take it

Come and catch me at tha Crossroads like Bone Thugs, time is short, he got no love,
it got no favorites, no hugs, so let's converse it that's sho nuff
What you talking bout, what he talking about, picked up the floor mat and now I'm walking out
And my mind slipping dipped while I'm on the couch with
Oxycodon in and out the mouth
I've been sitting up in that bed, and I got this metal off in my leg
Jaw is broken, coming down off a ledge I've been contemplating that I should of been dead
I ain't never been scared to look at my grave, God has already numbered my days
And still try to wonder why was I saved
Could of died below but instead I got raised
Aye look at my face and look what I've faced
Me close to dying was nothing, that's grace
Knowing I believe, that I struggle to have faith
Whether living or dying, man I dying to see his face
All this vanity, thank Adams eve, me trying to save face is insanity
cuz I ain't plan to be without a plan indeed, oh but nothing like is promised I guarantee

I'm drifting y'all, I'm losing my patience
I wish He could take it all away, I feel I can't take it,
cause I've been up in it so long, my heart is racing, I wish you could take it all away

Take it all away, Take it all away
Take it all away, Take it all away
Take it all away, Take it all away
Take it all away, Take it all away
Take it all away, Take it all away
Take it all away, Take it all away
Take it all away, Take it all away
Take it all away, Take it all away
