The city's sleeping now time's standing still
But some aren't sleeping now some never will

The night is watched by sleepless eyes and prowled by sleepless men
Haunted by a yesterday that's filled with what might have been
Vacant windows stare down at them as they search the empty streets
For answers they know they'll never find these men who never sleep

They've tossed and turned and read and smoked and bravely try again
And pray for sleep to simply come and gently cover them
But the nameless pain makes them rise to walk the silent streets
For only love can close the eyes of these men who never sleep

The city's sleeping now time's standing still
But some aren't sleeping now some never will

So we'll leave them there to walk and search with burnin' eyes and souls
The silence of the endless night neath stars of frozen gold
As they wait the touch of the Master's hand to bring them eternal peace
Then with smilin' lips they'll close their eyes these men who never sleep

The city's waking now a new day dawns
But for the sleepless ones the night goes on
