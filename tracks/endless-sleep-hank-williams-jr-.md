The night was black rain falling down look for my baby she's nowhere around
Traced her footsteps down to the shore afraid she's gone for evermore
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say I took your baby from you away
I heard a voice cryin' in deep come join me baby in my endless sleep

Why did we quarrel why did we fight why did I leave her alone tonight
That's why her footsteps ran into the sea that's why my baby has gone from me
I looked at the sea

Ran in the water heart full of fear there in the breakers I saw her near
Reached for my darling held her to me stole her away from the angry sea
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say you took your baby from me away
My heart cried out she's mine to keep I saved my baby from that endless sleep
Endless sleep endless sleep endless sleep
