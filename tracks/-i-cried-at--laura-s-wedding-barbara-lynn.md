I cried at Laura's wedding
I cried but I don't know why
I should have been happy
'Cause Laura was happy
But I felt so bad
I wanted to die

I cried at Laura's wedding
My tears were flowing like wine
It should have been me there
Instead of she there
The boy she had married
Should have been mine

Laura came to me
And quietly embraced me
She made sure that I'd catch
The bride's bouquet

I wondered how she had
The nerve to even face me
After taking
After taking him away

I cried at Laura's wedding
I cried but I don't know why
I cried when he kissed her
My younger sister
But then weddings
Always makes me cry
