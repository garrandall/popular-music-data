Do, do you got a first-aid kit handy?
Do, do you know how to patch up a wound?
Tell me, are, are, are, are you
Are you patient, understanding?
'Cause I might need some time
To clear the hole in my heart
And I, I've tried every remedy
And nothing seems to work for me

Baby, baby,
This situation's driving me crazy, crazy
And I really wanna be your lady, lady
But the one before you left me so

Damaged, damaged
Damaged, damaged
I thought that I should let you know
That my heart is damaged, damaged
So damaged, so damaged
And you can blame the one before

So how you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it
(Baby, I gotta know what you are gonna do?)
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it
(Baby, I gotta know what you are gonna do?)
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it

Do, do you got a first-aid kit handy?
Do, do you know how to patch up a wound?
Tell me, are, are, are, are you
Are you patient, understanding?
'Cause I might need some time
To clear the hole in my heart
And I

You try to gain my trust
Talking is not enough
Actions speak louder than words
You gotta show me something
My heart is missing some pieces
I need this puzzle put together again

Damaged, damaged
Damaged, damaged
I thought that I should let you know
That my heart is damaged, damaged
So damaged, so damaged
And you can blame the one before

So how you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it
(Baby, I gotta know what you are gonna do?)
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it
(Baby, I gotta know what you are gonna do?)
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it

Can you fix my h-e-a-r-t
'Cause it's d-a-m-a-g-e-d?
Can you fix my h-e-a-r-t?
Tell me are you up for the challenge
'Cause my heart is

Damaged, damaged,
Is damaged, damaged
I thought that I should let you know
That my heart is damaged, damaged
Don't you know my heart is damaged
So damaged
And you can blame the one before

Damaged, damaged,
So damaged
Damaged,
I thought that I should let you know
I thought that I should let you know
That my heart is damaged, damaged
So damaged, so damaged
And you can blame the one before

So how you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it

My heart is damaged, damaged, damaged
My heart is damaged, damaged, damaged
My heart is damaged, damaged, damaged
My heart is damaged, damaged, damaged
My heart is damaged
