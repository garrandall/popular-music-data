Yeah, you get off of my back, baby
Can't you tell you're choking me
Oh I ain't no pony, baby
Can't you tell you're choking me
Yeah, you just get off of my back, baby
Can't you see you're hurting me

Well, I don't mind helping you, baby
Every now, now and then
Yes, you ain't helped yourself, baby
Since God knows when
So you just get off of my back now, baby
Can't you see you're hurting me

Yes, I'm standing here telling you, baby
This is the end of the line
Yes, I'm tired of you riding me, baby
I declare I ain't lying
So you just get off of my back, baby
Can't you see you're hurting me

Well, you get off, get off, get off, baby
'Cause you're a heavy, heavy load
Yes, you can catch yourself
Another ride, baby
Somewhere further down the road
You just get off, get off, baby
Can't you see you're hurting me
