I left out in a cloud of taillights and dust
Swore I was not coming back
Said I'd enough
Saw you in the rear view standing
Fading from my life
But I wasn't turning round
No, not this time


But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Do not think I do not wonder about
Could have been, should have been all worked out
I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it


When we make choices we got to live with them
Heard you found a real good man, and you married him
I wonder if sometimes I cross your mind
Where would we be today?
If I never drove that car away


But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Do not think I do not wonder about
Could have been, should have been all worked out
I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't think about it


But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Do not think I do not wonder about
Could have been, should have been all worked out
I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it


No no
Don't think I don't
Don't think I don't
Mmm
