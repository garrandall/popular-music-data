You've got to change your evil ways... baby
Before I stop loving you
You've got to change... baby
And every word that I say is true
You've got me running and hiding
All over town
You've got me sneaking and peeping
And running you down
This can't go on...
Lord knows you got to change... baby

When I come home... baby
My house is dark and my pots are cold
You're hangin' round, baby
With Jean and Joan and-a who knows who
I'm getting tired of waiting and fooling around
I'll find somebody who won't make me feel like a clown
This can't go on...
Lord knows you got to change

When I come home, baby
My house is dark and my pots are cold
You're hangin' round, baby
With Jean and Joan and-a who knows who
I'm gettin' tired of waitin' and foolin' around
I'll find somebody who won't make me feel like a clown
This can't go on

Yeah ... Yeah ... Yeah ...
