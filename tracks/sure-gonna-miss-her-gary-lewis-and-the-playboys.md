I never did too much to make her stay here
And words of love to her I'd never say
I guess I learned a lesson when she walked out to stay
But I'm sure gonna miss her, sure gonna miss her, sure gonna miss her every day

I don't suppose I ever said "I love you"
And I found out too late that wasn't right
I'm just now realizin' what I lost, that's why I'm cryin'
And I'm sure gonna miss her, sure gonna miss her, sure gonna miss her every night

I know I took her love for granted
Guess you could say my love was blind
Thought if she left that I could stand it
Or else it didn't matter at the time

I heard she's found a guy that treats her better
I hope he knows that he's a lucky guy
I know the rumor's true because I saw her today
And I'm sure gonna miss her, he was walking with her, sure gonna miss her, yes I am
