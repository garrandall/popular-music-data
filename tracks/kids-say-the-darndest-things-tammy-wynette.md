Kids say the darndest things
Have you ever listened close to the games they play or the little songs they sing
Last night dressed up in high heel shoes and wearing my old hat
My four-year-old said I wanna divorce now where did she hear that

Kids say the darndest things...
Have you ever listened close to the games they play or the little songs they sing
Last night as I watched TV one rushed through the door
Mommy daddy's telling someone on the phone don't you call me here no more

Kids say the darndest things...
Have you ever listened close to the games they play or the little songs they sing
Bet my daddy can whip your daddy but daddy's never home
And I think mommy's worried bout him cause she cried all night long

Kids say the darndest things...
Have you ever listened close to the games they play or the little songs they sing
You never know what they learn at school or what they're thinking of
My first grader just said a four letter word and it sure wasn't love

Kids say the darndest things...
Have you ever listened close to the games they play or the little songs they sing
Kids say the darndest things...
