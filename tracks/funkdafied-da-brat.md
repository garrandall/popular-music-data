Hard times in the Funk



Yeah, So Funkdafied
So let's take a ride with the Brat, tat, tat tat...on that ass



So, So, So Funkdafied
So, So, So Funkdafied
So, So, So Funkdafied



Open up, open up
And let the funk flow in
From this nigga name J and his new found friend
I'm hittin switches like Eric on the solo creep
For yo jeep it's the B.R.A.T.
Puttin the dip in your hip from right to left
It's the ghetto west bitch and I'm So So Def
Nigga that's my click
Nigga that's who I rolls with
And we kicks nothing but the fat(sh,sh,hhh)

Them calls me the funkdafied, funkalistic, vocalistic
with the real shit, we got the shit you can't funk wit
(Why?!)
Because we so funkdafied
(Why?!)
We make you move from side to side
Well, it's da G H da E T T O, nigga
Brat and J.D. comin' like that big baby
So lay back and listen as I catch up on my pimpin'
And freak this dest just like Ashford and Simpson



Cause I'm so, so, so funkdafied
So, So, So funkdafied
So, So, So funkdafied
So, So, So Funkdafied



Puttin' it down (puttin' it down) ain't no thang to me
And ain't too many hoes that can hang with me
It's like that and as a matter of fact
When it comes the Brat tat tat tat
I make your neck snap back
Meaning I got the hit that a get'cha bent
Tearing the roof off this mutha like Parliament
I'm on a roll In Control like Janet, damnit!
Brat your the funk Bandit and they can't handle it
I know
That's why I keep hittin'em with this grammer
Lettin' all ya'll know that I'm the real mama jama
Straight to the head like a chronic sack
I pass the mic to the Brat and yo I passed it back

Wella sistas and fellas
It's time to get your groove on
I provide the funkdafied sounds that make yo move homes
Breaking these fools off proper like
It's S.O.S.O.D.E.F. dynamite
Hummin, hummin comin up at cha like Ralph K
And since this ain't no Honeymoon, I'm here to stay
And the way we comin' at cha
Baby we can't miss
There's a new tag team in town
Nigga, Whoomp, there it is



Cause I'm so, so, so Funkdafied
So, so, so funkdafied
So, so, so funkadfied
So, so, so funkadfied
So, so, so funkdafied
