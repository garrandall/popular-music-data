Say your prayers, little one, don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within, keep you free from sin
'Til the Sandman he comes


Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight


Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land


Something's wrong, shut the light, heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars, dreams of dragons' fire
And of things that will bite, yeah


Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight


Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land

Now, I lay me down to sleep (Now, I lay me down to sleep)
Pray the Lord my soul to keep (Pray the Lord my soul to keep)
And if I die before I wake (If I die before I wake)
Pray the Lord my soul to take (Pray the Lord my soul to take)
Hush, little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beast under your bed
In your closet, in your head


Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land (yeah, haha haha)


Oh, yeah-yeah, yo
We're off to never never-land
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land
