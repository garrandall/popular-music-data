Salvation, inflation
Depression and recession
Facing you whether it's in
Your home or on your corner

Don't let your separate beliefs
Let a lot of people starve
Orginization

Reality, Godfather
Sing it, James Brown

Reality is the thing for me
Reality is the thing for me
Yeah, yeah

Reality, reality
Reality, Godfather
Sing it, James Brown

I can't be myself
When I know I'm not
Doing no one else
Nobody

Everybody wanna go to Heaven
Nobody wants to die, yeah
Sing it, James Brown

Nobody wants to walk
Everybody wants to fly
Sing it, James Brown

Can't get no reservation
You've got starvation
Cause that's reality
Reality is the thing for me

Now let me read something to you
This is taken from the S&S
Use to be called Shakespeare
But we call it the
Streets of starvation

In the world of exactness
Half-stepping is totally out
You can jive, pride, and bull
Fool yourself but not the people

But if you wanna achieve a
Beautiful lifelong dream
You gotta set your head
In the right direction
You gotta deal with reality
Almighty reality

Reality is the thing for me, yeah
Reality, give me reality
Reality, I'll lie but you might
Not wanna hear what I tell you

Reality is the thing for me
Reality is the thing for me...
