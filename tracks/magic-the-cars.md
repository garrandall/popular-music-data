Summer, it turns me upside down
Summer, summer, summer
It's like a merry-go-round

I see you under the midnight
All shackles and bows
The high shoes
With the cleats a-clicking
A temperamental glow

How could you let me go

Oh, I got a hold on you
Got a hold on you
I've got a hold on you tonight

Oh, I got a hold on you
I got a hold on you
(Got a hold on you)
That's right

(Uh oh, it's magic)
When I'm with you
(Uh oh, it's magic)
Just a little magic
You know it's true
I got a hold on you

Oh, twisted
Under, sideways, down
I know you're getting twisted
And you can't calm down

I see you under the midnight
Love darts in your eyes
How far can you take it
Till you realize
There's magic in your eyes

I got a hold on you
Got a hold on you
Got a hold on you tonight

I got a hold on you
Got a hold on you
(Got a hold on you)
Yeah, oh, yeah, oh

(Uh oh, it's magic)
Uh oh, when I'm with you
(Uh oh, it's magic)
Uh oh, it's magic

Just a little bit of
Magic pulls me through
I got a hold on you

I've got a hold on you
I got a hold on you
(I got a hold on you)
That's right, it's magic

(Uh oh, it's magic)
Uh oh, it's magic
When I'm with you

(Uh oh, it's magic)
Just a little magic
Inside of you

(Uh oh, it's magic)
Takes a little bit of magic
That's true
When I'm with you

(Uh oh, it's magic)
Gotta be magic
Your magic pulls me through
