You take a piece of my heart
With you
Always, baby
You take a piece of my heart
With you
Always, always, baby


Time and time again
My girlfriends ask me
If we're just friends

And when I tell them that it is true
Deep down inside
I just want to be with you




It's long after dark
We're up all night talking
Heart to heart

And when it's time for you to go
I tell myself we're just friends
But we both know




I fall asleep and dream about you
Holding me deep in your soul
I just can't make it

Without you
I love you
More than you'll ever know
