I can't stand to see you sad
I can't bear to hear you cry
If you can't tell me what you need
All I can do is wonder why


Someday, someway aww
Someday, someway, yeah now
Someday, someway
Maybe I'll understand you


After all you've done for me
All I really want to do
Is take the love you brought my way
And give it all right back to you


Someday, someway awww
Someday, someway yeah yeah
Someday, someway
Maybe you'll understand me


You've taken everything from me
I've taken everything from you
I'll love you for my whole life through


Now after all you've done for me
