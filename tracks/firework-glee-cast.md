Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
6 feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you
'Cause there's a spark in you 

You just gotta ignite, the light, and let it shine
Just own the night like the 4th of July 

'Cause baby you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y 
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe 

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced 
If you only knew what the future holds 
After a hurricane comes a rainbow 
Maybe your reason why all the doors are closed 
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road 
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow 
And when it's time, you'll know 

You just gotta ignite, the light, and let it shine 
Just own the night like the 4th of July 

'Cause baby you're a firework 
Come on, show 'em what you're worth 
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh" 
As you shoot across the sky-y-y 
Baby, you're a firework 
Come on, let your colors burst 
Make 'em go "Oh, Oh, Oh" 
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe 

Boom, boom, boom 
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon 
It's always been inside of you, you, you 
And now it's time to let it through-ough-ough 

'Cause baby you're a firework 
Come on, show 'em what you're worth 
Make 'em go "Oh, Oh, Oh" 
As you shoot across the sky-y-y 
Baby, you're a firework 
Come on, let your colors burst 
Make 'em go "Oh, Oh, Oh" 
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe 

Boom, boom, boom 
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon 
Boom, boom, boom 
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
