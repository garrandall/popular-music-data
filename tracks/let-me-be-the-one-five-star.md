Let me be the one
You give your love to

I hear your records on the radio
See you talking on the late, late show
Every girl wants to be your friend

Don't you know you're always on my mind
Oh, how I've missed you since you've hit the big time
Oh, I'm hurting
I just can't pretend

We used to be together
Making dreams, making plans
But you left that world behind
Now I'm asking you
Don't you

Let me be the one (Let me be)
You give your love to
(The one you need, baby, baby)
Let me be the one (let me be)
You give your love to
(The one that turns your lovin' on)

We used to be together
Making dreams, making plans
But you left that world behind
Now I'm asking you
Don't you

Let me be the one (let me be)
You give your love to
(the one you need, baby, baby)
Let me be the one (let me be)
You give your love to
(I go running to you)

Let me be the one
You give your love to
(There's nothing I wouldn't do)
Let me be the one
You give your love to (Baby)
