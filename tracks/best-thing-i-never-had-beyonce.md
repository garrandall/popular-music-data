What goes around, comes back around (Hey, my baby!)
What goes around, comes back around (My, my, my baby!)
I say, what goes around comes back around (Hey, my baby!)
What goes around comes back around


There was a time I thought
That you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy, I must've been out of my mind


So when I think of the time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and I, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
Thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you, so baby, good looking out


I wanted you bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
You turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'm gon' always be the best thing you never had
I bet it sucks to be you right now


So sad, you're hurt
Boo hoo, oh, did you expect me to care?
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there


To I think that there was a time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass, and baby, yes, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
Thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you, baby, good looking out


I wanted you bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
I said, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'll never be the best thing you never had
Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now


I know you want me back
It's time to face the facts
That I'm the one that's got away
Lord knows that it would take another place, another time
Another world, another life
Thank God, I found the good in goodbye


I used to want you so bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oh, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I will always be the best thing you never had
Oh best thing you never had
I used to want you so bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oh, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oh I will never be the best thing you never had
Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now


What goes around, comes back around
What goes around, comes back around
(I bet it sucks to be you right now)
What goes around, comes back around
(I bet it sucks to be you right now)
What goes around, comes back around
(I bet it sucks to be you right now)
What goes around, comes back around
(I bet it sucks to be you right now)
