(Yo, Pierre You wanna come out here?)

In New York I Milly Rock, hide it in my socks
Running from an opp, and I shoot at opp
And I'm on the block, and I'm on the block
In New York I Milly Rock, hide it in my sock
Hide in my socks, selling that rerock

In New York I Milly Rock, hide it in my socks
Used to sell rerock, running from the cops
Shooting at the opps
Yo, Pierre You wanna come out here?
Shooting at the opps, cause I run the block
Gimme top top, in my drop top
All these hoes gon' flock flock, when I drop drop
All these hoes gon' flock flock, when I drop drop
All these hoes gon' flock flock, when I drop

Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo!
All these hoes want cash, all these hoes want bags
Fucking on yo bitch, on her dad
All these niggas sound like cats, sound like cats
I'm sosa, damn I thought I told you
Shootin' like a soldier like I'm from Magnolia
All these niggas, all these folk
Big bank, never fold
Sippin, (ay) feel that shit slow
Bitch um said, she like my clothing
I'm Atlanta, Young Carti global
Designer is on me, Carti dirty laundry
All these bitches want Young Carti
Young Carti, yeah
Young Carti, young Carti what
Young Carti, young Carti yeah
All of your bitches they loose, all of your bitches they loose
All of my bitches they rich
And they stay rockin' that Rick huh
Rich rich
Cash Carti bitch
Rich bitch
Got a rich clique, I'm suckin' on the clit
She's suckin' on the dick
Gave that hoe a tip, told her buy some kicks
Then I brought my team, hopped up in the whip
Rocky in the whip
Rocky in the whip
And I'm cocky, fuckin' on the thotties
She just wanna plot me
Bitch can't stop me
I'm riding in a a Masi, this ain't even my Masi
Oh that's not your thotty? Yo bitch look like a Aunty
Walking with Ashanti
Damn that look like Carti, damn, that look like Shanti
I think dat be Young Carti
Heard he spent a hunnid on a fucking watch yea
That's filthy

In New York I Milly Rock, hide it in my socks
Running from an opp, and I shoot at ops
And I'm on the block, hello and I'm on the block
In New York I Milly Rock, what hide it in my socks
Hide it in my socks, selling that rerock
In New York I Milly Rock, hide it in my socks
Use to sell rerock, running from the cops
Shooting at the opps
Yo, Pierre You wanna come out here?
Bitch ass nigga, fuck that nigga man!
