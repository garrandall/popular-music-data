There was a time not too far gone
When I was changed by just a song
On the radio and in my car
The pounding of an electric guitar

Then the time came to make our stand
We started up a four-piece band
And the heat felt like spotlights
In the heart of a hot summer night

Oh hot summer nights
Oh hot summer nights

Return with me to when times were best
We were friends that could pass any test
Shared our hopes, our dreams, our goals
And the fundamental rolls

As we sang in the dark rooms
Happy just to play our tunes
It felt good when we got it right
It felt good on a hot summer night

Oh hot summer nights
Oh hot summer nights

So it lives and it always will
The songs we sung are in us still
Ringing out with all of their might
In the heat of a hot summer night

Oh hot summer nights
Oh hot summer nights
