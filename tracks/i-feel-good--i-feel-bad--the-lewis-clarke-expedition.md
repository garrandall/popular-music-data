I feel good today
But it's annoying me
Because I've got no one
To be enjoying me

I'm sad to say
That it's annoying me
It's just a sunny day
And it's destroying me


I feel good, I feel bad
I feel bad, I feel good
These are the ones that make me mad
I think of all the good we had
And I feel good, I feel bad

It's just the rainy days
Bring out the best in me
It's only sunny days
That? me
I hear you callin'
And though I'm happy, baby
