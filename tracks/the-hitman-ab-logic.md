Watch out for the Hitman
Watch out - watch out - watch out - watch out
Here we go back to a groove, back and forth to make you move
Get up to the funky music on the dance floor and just swing it
Tonight's the night for you to let it hang out
You get funky while I get the house
Now I know that you got soul, there it is, put the ace in the hole
Feel the vibe while the rhythm control you, I command you to get loose
Yeah, I know you like my style, grab a girl and get buck wild
Show me what you got while the noise is pumpin'
The DJ's spinnin', the crowd is jumpin'
Turn up the music and let's motivate
Do that thing until your body starts to break
Watch out - watch out - watch out - watch out
I won't give it up, baby till you drop
Get down on the bea-eat (Feel the pump from the Hitman)
The Hitman makes you move, get into the groove
Let's turn on the hea-eat (Feel the pump from the Hitman)
Dance all ni-i-i-ight, dance all ni-ight
Dance all ni-i-i-ight, dance all ni-ight
Watch out - watch out - watch out - watch out
Now it's time to prove that you can move
But don't rush too fast, you might miss the last step
To a dance concept, K-Swing, I drop the power
That'll keep you rockin' after hours
Come on y'all, let's turn it up a notch
The bass will vibrate, the dance floor will jump
Up and down when the people start to yell
Yeah, no time to chill, dance all night 'cause you gotta be strong
There it is, you gotta move on, shake and bake your moneymaker
And let me take you to a style
That'll make you get down, get down, to a dope sound
Watch out for the Hitman
Watch out - watch out - watch out - watch out
I won't give it up baby
