Don't you be holding back your love
Don't you be holding back
Don't you be holding back your love
Don't you be holding back

'Cause in the end, girl, you're gonna want another round, another round
Girl, you're gonna want another round, another round
I used to want you, and her, and her, and her, and you, and her, and her
I used to want you, and her, and her, and her
All I want, all I want, all I want is you

Shorty got a mean walk, a mean shoe game
Bitch badder than any bitch that you name
I'm talking Janet, maybe Kim K. I heard Rihanna. She like it kinky
Come on


Quit playing, girl, you know that you want it
I can tell just by the way you push it out and flaunt it you're bad
Something like Dirty Diana. Body dope as heron
The sex is off the handle

Your ex couldn't beat it. I hit it like a free throw
And since I lost some weight you say I got a big ego
It's too strong. You said the drive stick.
Well, baby, just peel off

Loving how it lasts long. Leave the sheets gushy
Fuck you with the mask on. Halloween pussy
Your body shivers and trembles with each and every stroke
Pussy wetter than ever. Enough to sink a boat


Don't you be holding back your love
Don't you be holding back
Don't you be holding back your love
Don't you be holding back

'Cause in the end, girl, you're gonna want another round, another round
Girl, you're gonna want another round, another round
I used to want you, and her, and her, and her, and you, and her, and her
I used to want you, and her, and her, and her
All I want, all I want, all I want is you

Shorty got a mean walk, a mean shoe game
Bitch badder than any bitch that you name
I'm talking Janet, maybe Kim K. I heard Rihanna. She like it kinky
Come on


Never hesitate, purchasing in every state
Transported in foreign cars to large estates
So believe me, you know you wanna come home, girl
As long as we can kick it with your home, girl

Had two on one fast break. That's a slam dunk
I know you want it. I can take you where ya man won't
Champs-ÃlysÃ©es. Think Rolls Royce
Yellow Nuvo and pink boy shorts


Don't you be holding back your love
Don't you be holding back
Don't you be holding back your love
Don't you be holding back

'Cause in the end, girl, you're gonna want another round, another round
Girl, you're gonna want another round, another round
I used to want you, and her, and her, and her, and you, and her, and her
I used to want you, and her, and her, and her
All I want, all I want, all I want is you


Girl, you got the bomb thing. Know I can't resist
I'm 'a light some candles, girl, then tie up your wrists
Then I'm licking chocolate right off of your stomach
Baby, you ain't had no freaky shit like this

And I start dripping ice down ya spine (oh oh)
I'll make you mine
And now you're telling all your girls I done tore it up
So don't be mad that they all want me. There's room for all of us


Don't you be holding back your love
Don't you be holding back
Don't you be holding back your love
Don't you be holding back

'Cause in the end, girl, you're gonna want another round, another round
Girl, you're gonna want another round, another round
I used to want you, and her, and her, and her, and you, and her, and her
I used to want you, and her, and her, and her
All I want, all I want, all I want is you

Shorty got a mean walk, a mean shoe game
Bitch badder than any bitch that you name
Go, girl. Yeah. Just shake it
I want you, baby, naked
