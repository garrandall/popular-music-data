We got the message
I heard it on the airwaves
The politicians
Are now DJs
The broadcast was spreading
Station to station
Like an infection
Across the nation
Though you know you can't stop it
When they start to play
You're gonna get out the way

The politics of dancing
The politics of, oh feeling good
The politics of moving, aha
If this message's understood

The politics of dancing
The politics of, oh feeling good
The politics of moving, aha
If this message's understood

We're under pressure
Yes we're counting on you
Like what you say
Is what you do
It's in the papers
It's on your tv news
Oh, the application
Is just a point of view
Well you know you can't stop it
When they start to play
You're gonna get out the way

The politics of dancing
The politics of, oh feeling good
The politics of moving, aha
If this message's understood

Yeah

The politics of dancing
The politics of, oh feeling good
The politics of moving, aha
If this message's understood

The politics of dancing
The politics of, oh feeling good
The politics of moving, aha
If this message's understood
