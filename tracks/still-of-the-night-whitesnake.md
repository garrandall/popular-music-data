In the Still of the Night
I hear the wolf howl, honey
It sniffing around your door
In the Still of the Night
I hear my heart beating heavy
Telling me I gotta have more

In the shadow of night
I see the full moon rise
Telling me what's in store
My heart start shaking
My body start an aching
And I just can't take no more
No, no

Baby...

Now I just wanna get close to you
And taste your love so sweet
And I just wanna make love to you
Feel your body heat

In the Still of the Night
In the Still of the Night
Over here, baby

In the heat of the day
I hang my head down low
Hide my face from the sun
Through the light of the day
Until the evening time
Waiting for the night to come

Baby...

In the Still of the Night
In the cool moonlight
I feel my heart is aching
In the Still of the Night

Ooh baby...
I can't keep away, no
Can't keep away
I can't keep away
No, no, no...

In the Still of the Night
I hear the wolf howl, honey
It sniffing around your door
In the Still of the Night
I hear my heart beating heavy
Telling me I gotta have more

Ooh, more...

Now I just wanna get close to you
And taste your love so sweet
And I just wanna make love to you
Feel your body heat

In the Still of the Night
In the Still of the Night
I'd be sneaking around your door
Still of the Night, Still of the Night, Still of the Night
Still of the Night, Still of the Night, Still of the Night
Still of the Night, Still of the Night, Still of the Night
