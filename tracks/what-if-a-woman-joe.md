What if a woman
Had a man on the side
And she never spent time with you
What if a woman
Said she's working late
And it's always the same excuse
What if a woman
Took the keys to your whip
Said I'll be right back, don't trip
What if a woman
Left you home with the kids
Changing diapers and shit
What a twist


Could you stand inside her shoes and walk a mile?
(I don't really think so)
Could you hold her down when she doesn't smile?
(I don't know a man who could)
What if a woman, what if a woman
What if a woman was just like you?
What if a woman, what if a woman
What if a woman was just like you?
What if a woman, what if a woman
What if a woman was just like us?
What if a woman, what if a woman
What if a woman
Could you ever wonder if she does?


What if a woman
Started wearing the pants
Would you feel less of a man and more
What if a woman
Never wanna settle down
Always wanna run around on the low
You can beg, you can plead, you can cry
She won't be your wife
But your eyes are full of tears
She'll be running the streets
With girls hanging out tonight
It's the same thing you do to her

If the table were turned around
Would you leave? Would you stay?
Would you drown?
If the cards you were dealt were to change
Would you let your hand go up in flames?


What if a woman, what if a woman
What if a woman was just like you?
What if a woman, what if a woman
What if a woman was just like you?
What if a woman, what if a woman
What if a woman was just like us?
What if a woman, what if a woman
What if a woman
Could you ever wonder if she does?
