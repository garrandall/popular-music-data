So little time, so little time - I'm so frustrated
So little joy, so little joy - It's complicated
So little time, so little time, time to work it on out
Yeah yeah


So little joy, so little joy - It's complicated
I feel I'm stumbling in the dark - Somnambulated
I feel my heart seekin' the sparks, and prayin' for love
Love love
Prayin' for love


So little joy, so little joy - It's complicated
So little time, so little time - when your heart's been faded
So little hope, so little hope - and I'm prayin' again for love
Love love
Is more than enough


Simply being loved loved loved
Simply being loved loved loved
Simply being loved loved loved
Is more than enough, yeah yeah
Simply being loved loved loved
Simply being loved loved loved
Simply being loved loved loved
Is more than enough, yeah yeah

Simply being loved, yeah yeah
Is more than enough, yeah yeah
Simply being loved, yeah (is more than enough)


So little joy, so little joy - It's complicated
So little time, so little time - get acclimated
So little hope, so little hope, and I'm prayin' now for love
Yeah


So little time the pace has changed -but I'm still waiting
A thousand years of timeless days - Somnambulating
I'm stumbling wounded in the dark, but I'm prayin' still for love
Love love
Prayin' for love

Love love love ...Simply be loved (love love)


Simply being loved loved loved
Simply being loved loved loved
Simply being loved loved loved
Is more than enough, yeah yeah

Simply being loved, yeah (is more than enough)


Yeah yeah - I'm in love
Yeah yeah - To simply be -
Yeah yeah -I'm in love, yeah!


Simply being loved loved loved
Simply being loved loved loved
Simply being loved loved loved
Is more than enough, yeah yeah

Simply being loved, yeah yeah
Simply being loved, yeah yeah
Simply being loved, yeah yeah
Simply being loved, yeah


Simply being loved -is more than enough
Simply being loved -is more than enough
Simply being loved -is more than enough
Simply being loved -is more than enough
Yeah
