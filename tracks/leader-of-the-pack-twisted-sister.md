Hey, is he really goin' out with her?
There he is, let's ask him
Hey man, is that your ring she's wearin'?
Man, it must be great ridin' with her
Are you pickin' her up after school today?
By the way where'd you meet her
I met her at the candy store
She turned around and smiled at me
You get the picture?
Yeah, we see
That's when she fell for

The leader of the pack

Her folks were always putting me down
They said I came from the wrong side of town
They told her that I was bad
But she knew I was sad
That's why she fell for

The leader of the pack

One day her dad said find someone new
She had to tell me that we were through
I stood there and asked her why
But all she could do was cry
"I'm sorry I hurt you"

The leader of the pack

She was so small
As she kissed me goodbye,
Her tears were beginning to show
And as she drove away on that rainy night
I begged her to go slow
If she heard I'll never know
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

I felt so helpless what could I do?
Remembering all the things we'd been through
The gang they all stop and stare
I can't hide my tears but I don't care
I'll never forget her

The leader of the pack

Leader of the pack
And now she's gone
...
