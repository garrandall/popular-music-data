My love,
There's only you in my life
the only thing that's right


My first love
You're every breath that I take
you're every step I make


And I


(And I-I-I)


I want to share


All my love with you


No one else will do...


And your eyes


Your eyes, your eyes


They tell me how much you care
Oh yes, you will always be
My endless love

Two hearts,
Two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun


And Forever


(oo)


I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms


And love


oh love


I'll be a fool
For you,
I'm sure


You know I don't mind


Oh, you know I don't mind


'Cause you,
You mean the world to me
Oh


I know


I know


I've found in you
My endless love

do do do do do
do do do do do
do do doo doo

Oh, and love


Oh, love


I'll be that fool
For you,
I'm sure


you know I don't mind


Oh you know-


I don't mind

And, YES
You'll be the only one
'Cause no one no one can deny
This love I have inside
And I'll give it all to you


My love


My love, my love


My endless love
