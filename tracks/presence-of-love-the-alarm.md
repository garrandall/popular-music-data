The first heaven is silver
And you are silver, you shine white light
The second heaven's sacred
And you are sacred of pure soul
The third heaven is pearl
And your name is forever written
Oh, don't walk away
No, don't walk away

I'm walking in the presence of love
I'm walking in the seven heavens
I'm alive with the agony, the ecstasy
Strive for the pleasure and the pain
I'm walking in the presence of love

The fourth heaven is white gold
And you cry white golden tears
The fifth heaven is holy
You are the angel of sweet mercy
The sixth heaven is of ruby
Of the wind and of the earth
Oh, don't walk away
No, don't walk away

I'm walking in the presence of love

I'm walking in the seven heavens
I'm alive with the agony, the ecstasy
Strive for the pleasure and the pain
I'm walking in the presence of love

I don't want to die in a hell on earth
In the valley below in the pain and the hurt
In the sea of danger drowning me
There's a ray of hope

When I'm walking in the presence of love
I'm walking in the seven heavens
I'm alive with the agony, the ecstasy
Strive for the pleasure and the pain
I'm walking in the presence of love

I'm walking in the presence of love
I'm walking in the seven heavens
I'm walking in the presence of love
I'm coming into heaven of love

I'm walking in the presence of love
I'm walking into heaven of love
I'm walking in the presence of love
I'm walking into heaven...
