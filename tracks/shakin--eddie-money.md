Rosanna's daddy had a car she loved to drive
Stole the keys one night and took me for a ride
Turned up the music just as loud as it could go
Blew out the speakers in her daddy's radio

She was shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)
Snappin' her fingers (oh oh ooo oh)
She was movin' round and round (oh oh ooo oh)
That girl was shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)

We started drinkin' wasn't thinkin' too straight
She was doin' 80 and she slammed on the brakes
Got so high we had to pull to the side
Her tits were shakin' 'til the middle of the night

Shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)
Snappin' her fingers (oh oh ooo oh)
She was up and down and round and round
Shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)
Shakin' (oh oh ooo oh) (oh oh ooo oh)
(oh oh ooo oh) (oh oh ooo oh)

I got a little nervous
When she took her coat off
She looked so pretty
Ahh yeah

I'm always talkin' baby talkin' too much
I love that little girl and I just can't get enough
It takes a lonely night with nowhere to go
Just call Rosanna, it's a hell of a show

And she's shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)
Snappin' her fingers (oh oh ooo oh)
She'll be movin' round and round (oh oh ooo oh)
Oh she's shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)

Shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)
Snappin' her fingers (oh oh ooo oh)
She'll be movin' up and down (oh oh oo oh)
Round and round and round (oh oh ooo oh)
And shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)

Sha sha sha sha sha she was shakin'
Sha sha sha sha sha she was shakin'
Sha sha sha sha sha she was shakin'
Sha sha sha sha sha she was shakin'
