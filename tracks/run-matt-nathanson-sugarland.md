I wanna watch you undress
I wanna watch you glow
Let your hair down
All around and cover us both
You come in waves
We crash and we roll
You surround me, pull me, drown me, then swallow me whole


You turn, turn, turn, turning me on
Like a slow fire burn
I know that it's wrong
Still I run, run, run, run right into you
Yeah, I run, run, run, run right into you


Oh, oh, oh


You pull me in close
You buckle my knees
I shake and I shiver just to feel you breathe
You trace my lines
I trace your lines
Stirring my soul
Shoot sparks at the heart of the world and I watch it explode
I watch you, yeah, I watch you


You turn, turn, turn, turning me on
Like a slow fire burn
I know that it's wrong
Still I run, run, run, run right into you
Yeah, I run, run, run, run right into you


Oh, oh, oh


I’m amazing (oh, oh, oh) when you’re beside me
(Oh, oh, oh)
I am so much more
(Oh, oh, oh)
And I feel your fingers
(Oh, oh, oh)
Pound like thunder
(Oh, oh, oh)
And I am so much more
I'm so much more


You turn, turn, turn, turning me on
Like a slow fire burn
I know that it's wrong
Still I run, run, run, run right into you, oh
Oh, you turn, turn, turn, turning me on
Like a slow fire burn
I know that it's wrong
Still I run, run, run, run right into you
(I run)
Still, I run, run, run, run right into you
(Oh love, oh Lord)
Still I run, run, run, run right back to you


Turning me on
Like a slow fire burn
