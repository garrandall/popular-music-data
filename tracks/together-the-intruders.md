(Together, together)
Oh, oh we could be on a desert
Lost without a place (place) to (to) go (go)
And we're so in love, in love with each other
That we wouldn't even (even) know (know)

(Oh, I) don't care (I don't care)
Anyplace, anywhere (anywhere)
(Just as long as) just as long
(We are there) as we are there, baby, baby
(Together) together, baby
(Together) together, baby
(Baby, just you and me) just you and me
(Woah) oh, how (happy) happy (we'll) we'll be (be)

And, oh, oh, oh, we could be in proverty
No one to lend a helping (helping) hand (hand)
But it's alright (alright), alright I know
Because you always under(under)stand(stand)

(Oh, I) and I don't care (I don't care)
Anyplace, anywhere (anywhere)
(Just as long as) just as long
(We can share) as we share them, baby, baby
(Together) together, baby
(Together) together, baby
(Baby, just you and me) just you and me
(Woah) oh, how (happy) happy (we'll) we'll (be) be

(Oh, I) and I don't care (I don't care)
Anyplace, anywhere (anywhere)
(Just as long as) just as long
(We can share) as we share them, baby, baby
(Together) together, baby
(Together) together, baby
(Baby, just you and) just (me) you and me
(Woah) oh, how happy (happy) we'll (we'll) be (be)

(Together) oh, we're together
(Together) we're gonna stay together
(Together) do it all together
(Together) gonna work together
(Together) girl, every day, ever now
(Together) gonna stay together
(Together) oh, we're together
