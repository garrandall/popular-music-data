And so I give her
What she wants, what she needs
Why
'Cause her love is worth more than
Maybachs and diamonds, yeah


You got them big dreams in your eyes
You're thinkin' Hollywood
If I could be your Woody Allen, then I probably would
Write a nice script, make you my lead girl
Put your talent on display for the free world
Liz Taylor, you're lookin' for that right man
I'm black all your ex's they've been white men
But don't that make it more excitin'?
If that's a crime I'm ready for the indictment
Yeah, I think it's way more sexy
When you speak your mind, you check me
And you're color blind you just accept me
Plus you're a smart girl, you know where them checks be
Right here, plus you got your own too
Since I met you, you've been standing on your own two
And so there's nothing that I won't do
Maybach, chrome shoes, every time I come through




We used to argue, I would call you a fuckin' bitch
But we made it through the storm now we're fuckin' rich
You've been a friend to me
You kept it real when others would just pretend to be
I couldn't see it then, I would get mad when you criticized
Told you that you were buggin', you over analyzed
I know I said I didn't care we was breakin' up
Still flew half way around the world to make it up
And all the first-class seats were sold out
But it was Summer where you were and for me was cold out
So, like a champion after defeat
You watched me break down and cry in the passenger seat
You put your arm around me, told me it would be just fine
I'd be yours and you would be just mine
And you wanted the love bracelet, I said you get what you pay for
The black card - we're buying the Cartier store
