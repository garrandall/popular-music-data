Yo it's me Left Eye not about to settle for anybody wit'
A thang about me havin' to pary
My life's havin' fun takin' a reason addin' season makin'
It he's in what is pleasin' cause yo I gots one
I am unordinary the more balls the merry
Not two hangin' hairy wit' dairy airy
Cause to impress me is not to undress me
That's only unless we agree you down wit' O.P.P.
And bein' honestly is what I want you to be 
You wanna control me you need much authority
Understanding the depths of the '90s women
That is the way that I'm livin'


Das da way we like 'em
Das da way we like 'em
Das da way we like 'em (das da way)
Das da way we like 'em

What up what up yo
The way that I like 'em or better 
Yet let's talk about the way I dislike 
The type that's always out to despite
Or what about the ones that's under your feet
Or like to wipe your butt before you're leavin' the dookey seat
But so take your time and you'll find
That is is true I like the ones that
Walk through the parties wit' their pants saggin' down
Spend a little time wit' me and not wit' the crowd
Chillin' in the crib wit' da docs
Or maxin' on the couch to a Babyface song yeah
Understanding the depth of cool women
Unhh cause that's the way T-Boz is livin'



Yo erri uuhh erri erri...
I like a man with romance in his heart
And the ability to chrk-chrk take on the part
Not the kind who be tippin' and tappin' and
Slippin' and slappin' 'em
Cause I'll be comin' wit' a bat and start smackin' him
But wait a minute I ain't dealin' like that no!
I need a man who's gonna venture out at pleasin' yeah dats me hey
Cause I'm the kind who'll be givin' it right back
But in the serious tip he's gotta come with respect
Casue that's where I'm at
Understanding the depths of the good women
Yeah that's me cause that's the way that Chilli's livin'



Yo what's up
It's the 411 on the 911 man
Erri uuhh erri erri
And as Dolomite would say "Can you dig it man?"
What up Damian Dame, Jermaine Jackson
Hello out to LA., Face and Pebbles
DeRock and Kayo's in the house
Marley Marl in the house
I'd like to kick it to Dallas and his crew
H. P. M. Highland Place Mobsters
Jermaine Dupri krisskrossin' Dolemix
So yo how's ya livin'
Raina and Ronald 
Hi Mom
That is oooh on the TLC tip
Oooh on the TLC tip
