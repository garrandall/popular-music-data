Who's that I see walkin' in these woods?
Why it's Little Red Ridin' Hood
Hey there Little Red Riding Hood
You sure are lookin' good
You're everything a big bad wolf could want
Listen to me, Little Red Ridin' Hood
I don't think little big girls should
Go walkin' in these spooky old woods alone

What big eyes you have
The kind of eyes that drive wolves mad
So, just to see that you don't get chased
I think I ought, to walk, with you for a ways

What full lips you have
They're sure to lure, someone bad
So, untill you get to grandma's place
I think you ought, to walk, with me and be safe

I'm gonna keep my sheep suit on
Till I'm sure that you've been shown
That I can be trusted walkin' with you alone

Little Red Ridin' Hood
I'd like to hold you if I could
But you might think I'm a big bad wolf, so I won't

What a big heart I have
The better to love you with
Little Red Ridin' Hood
Even bad wolves can be good
I'll try to keep satisfied
Just to walk close by your side
Maybe you'll see things my way
Before we get to grandma's place

Little Red Ridin' Hood
You sure are lookin' good
You're everything a big bad wolf could want

I mean... Baa... baa... baa
