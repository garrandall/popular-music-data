Runnin' from the feelin'
Can't disguise 
Findin' all your reasons 
Were alibis 
You can say your breezin' 
It's not that way at all... 
You're headed for a fall 

Lookin' for excuses 
To hide your shame 
But all your little loose ends 
Don't change a thing 
You're the one who loses 
By runnin' from it all 
Backs against the wall 
You're headed for a fall 
For a fall 

Starin' out your window 
At the pourin' rain 
Tryin' to hide your sorrow 
In your sweet champagne 
You can't lose your troubles 
In the bubbles of your wine 
Only makes them easier to find 
Easier to find 

All your wasted chances 
How do they feel 
All your sweet romances 
Were never real 
Cause you're the one who dances 
Got to pay the piper's call 
Backs against the wall 
You're headed for a fall 
You're headed for a fall 
You're headed for a fall 

For a fall 
You're headed for a fall 
You're headed for a fall 
You're fallin', I see you fallin' 
For a fall 
You're fallin', I see you fallin' 
You're headed for a fall...
