The deal is on the rise again
The ship comes in to shore
You've been away to somewhere
But life goes on no less

Through the foreign ocean
Underneath the sea

And walls come tumbling down
We'll be forever calm
And you'll be here in my arms
I'll keep you away from harm

I thought about you twice just then
You get me every time
Keeps coming out of nowhere
It cannot be defined

Your colours are magnificent
From magenta to bright blue

And walls come tumbling down
We'll be forever calm
And you'll be here in my arms
I'll keep you away from harm

Through the foreign ocean
Underneath the sea

And walls come tumbling down
We'll be forever calm
And you'll be here in my arms
I'll keep you away from harm
