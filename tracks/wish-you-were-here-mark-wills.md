They kissed goodbye at the terminal gate
She said, "You're gonna be late if you don't go"
He held her tight, said, "I'll be alright
I'll call you tonight to let you know"
He bought a postcard, on the front, it just said "Heaven"
With a picture of the ocean and the beach
And the simple words he wrote her
Said he loved her and they told her
How he'd hold her if his arms would reach


Wish you were here, wish you could see this place
Wish you were near, I wish I could touch your face
The weather's nice, it's paradise
It's summertime all year and there's some folks we know
They say, "Hello," I miss you so, wish you were here


She got a call that night but it wasn't from him
It didn't sink in right away, "Ma'am, the plane went down
Our crews have searched the ground
No survivors found," she heard him say
But somehow she got a postcard in the mail
That just said "Heaven" with a picture of the ocean and the beach
And the simple words he wrote her
Said he loves her and they told her
How he'd hold her if his arms would reach


Wish you were here, wish you could see this place
Wish you were near, I wish I could touch your face
The weather's nice, it's paradise
It's summertime all year and there's some folks we know
They say, "Hello," I miss you so, wish you were here
The weather's nice, in paradise
It's summertime all year and all the folks we know
They say, "Hello," I miss you so, wish you were here
Wish you were here
