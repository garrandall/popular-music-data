Never had the pleasure of loving you
Nothing, girl, can measure what I would do
You're everything that I desire
All of the good thoughts I have, babe, you inspire

All because you're so unique, baby
I can't help but love you, girl
None can compete, girl, with you
You, you're mine, baby, girl, girl, girl

You're so delicious to a taste
Girl, let me hold you tightly around your waist
 you listen to what I say
I'm gonna love you, girl, girl, in a special way

All because you're so unique, baby
I can't help but love you, girl, no
None can compete, girl, with you
You, you're mine, baby

You're so unique, babe
I can't help but love you, girl
None can compete, girl, with you
You, you're mine
