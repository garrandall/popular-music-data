There's something I know I should of told you
Something that's growing everyday
Whether or not
I say it a lot
I'm down with you in every single way
Gonna be days when you are lonely
And people will say they got no time
When you're alone
Call me on the phone
Baby, you always got mine
And when the wind blows
Baby, don't cry, just remember my words


Baby luv
Gentle as raindrops falling in June
Pretty as sunshine
And flowers in bloom
Baby love

As long as you're happy, I'm happy too
It's a delight
You're in my life
You got a glow that just surrounds you
When I'm with you I'm shining bright
Honey, it's true
I love the way you do
And I could tell you every night
You're so lovely when you're laughing
It makes my day just to see you smile
Didn't you know
When you played in the snow
You set my winter on fire
And when the wind blows
Baby, don't cry, just remember my worlds
Baby love
Gentle as raindrops falling in June
Pretty as sunshine and flowers in bloom
Baby love
Long as your happy, I'm happy too
It's a delight
God gave you life
Baby love
Oh, baby luv, baby, baby
