Well, I heard you tell somebody on the telephone
That you'd meet 'em on the corner and you'd be alone
Wouldn't keep him waitin' for too very long
Just to give you one more hour and you'd be right there
Slip right into something, comb and brush your hair
Hit the ground runnin', before I knew it, you were gone

It was a one night stand
That's what you told me
That's what it had to be
Well, you couldn't help it
That you found another man
It was a one night stand
That's what she told me
That's how it had to be
Guess I'll have to change my plans
Just a one night stand

One night stand
One night stand
She said it was a one night stand
One night stand

Said it was your girlfriend, you'd be back at three
You and her were goin' on a shoppin' spree
And for me no to worry, I was your only man
Well, I heard the story many times before
I decided not to take it no more
I know where you're goin', baby, I know you plan

It was a one night stand
That's what you told me
That's what it had to be
She said she was sorry
That she found another man
A one night stand
That's what she told me
That's how it had to be
Guess I'll have to change my plans
Just a one night stand

One night stand
One night stand
She said it was a one night stand
One night stand

I heard the story many times before
Well, I decided not to take it no more
'Cause I know where you're goin' and I know where you'll be
Down at the barroom with you friend
Laughin' and a-singin', drinkin' whiskey and gin
The last thing on your mind, baby, was me

It was a one night stand
That's what you told me
That's what it had to be
She said she couldn't help it
That she found another man
A one night stand
That's what she told me
That's how it had to be
Guess I'll have to change my plans
Just a one night stand

One night stand
One night stand
One night stand
One night stand

She said it was a one night stand
That's what you told me
It was a one night stand
One night stand
She said it was a one night stand
