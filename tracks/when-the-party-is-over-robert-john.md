Packed my suitcase, I racked my brain,
I bought a ticket on the late night train.
Took a taxi through the pourin' rain, 
I'm comin' home to you.

Flew from Boston out to San Jose,
Saw our old friends in Monterey Bay.
When they asked me if I'd like to stay, I said 
I'm comin' home to you.

I'm comin' home, 
Made up my mind that's what I'm gonna do.
Can't love nobody on the telephone, 
I'm comin' home to you.

They threw a party there from dusk till' dawn,
Seems like everybody knows ol' Sleepy John.
He says next time I down here, bring you along,
I'm comin' home to you.

There's fresh caught salmon on the bar-b-q's
There were people jammin' to the all nite blues
Life is good out in Santa Cruz, but
I'm comin' home to you.

I'm comin' home, 
Made up my mind that's what I'm gonna do.
Can't love nobody on the telephone, 
I'm comin' home to you.

I drove wherever -- out to god knows where,
Come 10:30 there was no one there.
They couldn't pay me, but I didn't care,
I'm comin' home to you.

I'm feelin' better since I got your card.
I read it over and over when the road gets hard.
Ain't nothin' better than your own backyard.
I'm comin' home to you.

I'm comin' home, 
Made up my mind that's what I'm gonna do.
Can't love nobody on the telephone, 
I'm comin' home to you.

I'm comin' home, 
Made up my mind that's what I'm gonna do.
Can't love nobody on the telephone, 
I'm comin' home to you.

Packed my suitcase, I racked my brain,
I bought a ticket on the late night train.
Took a taxi through the pourin' rain.
