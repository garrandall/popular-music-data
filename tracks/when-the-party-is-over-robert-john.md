I don't mind you having a good time
Being free
But I don't like you tasting some new wine
Without me

For although I really love you
I still am a man
And my heart is breaking
From all I've been taking
Girl can't you see what you're doing to me

When the party is over
You might find you're alone
When the party is over
There might be no one at home

I find it hard not to be
Close to the door
And each night I find myself weak
I walk the floor

Baby
And though I've had time for thinking
I find I still care
My hear is breaking from what I've been taking
Oh, girl can't you see what you're doing to me

When the party is over
You might find you're alone
When the party is over
There might be no one at home

When the party is over
You might find you're alone
When the party is over
There might be no one at home

When the party is over
You might find you're alone
When the party is over
There might be no one at home
