 Neither of us ever thought, back on the first day that we met
We were both so convinced that the dream would never end
Nobody saw the signs man, it's funny how love is blind man
'Cause it can be over just as fast as it begins

So now I be sitting here, I'm alone trying to stuff my fear
Checkin' out one of the pictures there up on the shelf
The story behind my song, is that you never know what you got 'til it's gone

 What have I gotta do to make you love me?
What have I gotta do to be heard?
What do I do when it's all over?
Sorry seems to be the hardest word

 How can I forget that day, that I got up and walked away?
I can still see the tears and the years fall from your eyes
And now I'm all alone, I got nothin' else to do but pray
For the dream that I might have you back here in my life

I'm hoping that now you can see, between the real and the fantasy
Reality is rough but it always has a key ( So sorry, so so sorry)
The story behind my words... well,
I hope you agree that the truth will set you free



 (So sorry, so so sorry)



 What have I gotta do to make you love me?
 Tell me what I gotta do
 What have I gotta do to be heard?
 Oh, I need you in my life
 What do I do when it's all over?
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry
 What have I gotta do?
What have I gotta do?
Sorry seems to be the hardest word

 Tell me what I gotta do...
Oh, I need you in my life
( So sorry, so so sorry)
