When people say you're not my kind
And that your clothes are out of line
And that your hair isn't combed all the time
You're not real pretty but you're mine

We have a great big old society
That won't make room for folks like you and me
But I got some real bad news for them my friend
They're on the outside looking in

We've got a great thing going
And its gonna keep on growing
And I hope that real soon they'll see the light
But until that time they'll have to blow their mind
Cos it ain't us that's gonna lose this fight

So when we're walking I don't care
When all those people stop and stare
If they'd look in your eyes they'd see
You're not real pretty but you belong to me

Hey hey hey now
Hey hey hey now
When you're lovin' me baby
And when I hold you baby 
I know you love me baby 
You know I'll never leave you 
I know I'll always love you 
You know I love you baby
You know I love you baby
