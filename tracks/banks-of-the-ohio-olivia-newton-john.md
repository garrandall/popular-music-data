I asked my love to take a walk
To take a walk, just a little walk
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others' arms entwine
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio

I held a knife against his breast
As into my arms he pressed
He cried "my love, don't you murder me
I'm not prepared for eternity"

I wandered home 'tween twelve and one
I cried, "My God, what have I done?"
I've killed the only man I love
He would not take me for his bride

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others' arms entwine
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio
