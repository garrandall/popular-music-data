Nicky's in the corner
With a black coat on
Running from a bad home
With some cat inside

Now where did you find her
Among the neon lights
That haunt the streets outside
Stay with me

Beautiful girl (stay with me)
Beautiful girl (stay with me)
She wants to go home

From doorway to doorway
Street corner to corner
With the neon ghosts in the city
And she says

Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me

She's so scared
So very frightened
Anything could happen
Right here tonight

Beautiful girl (stay with me)
Beautiful girl (stay with me)
She wants to go home

Stay with me (beautiful girl)
Stay with me (beautiful girl)
Stay with me (beautiful girl)
Stay with me (beautiful girl)
