Let me tell you about the life
And how live when you a star
Every single place you go
The people run up to your car
Everybody wants to talk
Everybody wants to jive
Everybody wants a hand shake
Or want a high five
And these ugly girls always got a friend that wanna talk to you
Yahhh yahhh trick and your friend yahhh yahhh too

So get up out my face

I'm starting to get mad
Walkin' up
"Soulja boy can I have your autograph"
Snitch yahhh trick
Leave me alone
Let me get some peace
I'm sittin' at the house
Shawty and I can't sleep
Leave me alone folks
Before I have to knock your lights out
"Hey Soulja Boy
When that new Stack On Deck CD come out?"
Snitch yahhh trick snitch yahhh trick
Yahhh Ya yahhh ya yahhh yahhh
