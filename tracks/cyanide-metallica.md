Sleep, and dream of this
Death angel's kiss
Brings final bliss
Come believe me


Empty they say
Death, won't you let me stay
Empty they say
Death, hear me call your name
Oh, call your name


Suicide, I've already died
You're just the funeral I've been waiting for
Cyanide, living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore


Wait, wait patiently
Your death-black wings
Unfolding sleep
Spreading o'er me


Empty they say
Death, won't you let me stay
Empty they say
Death, hear me call your name
Oh, call your name


Suicide, I've already died
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for
Cyanide, living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore


Say, is that rain or are they tears
That stained your concrete face for years?
The crying, weeping, shedding strife
Year after year, life after life

An air of freshly broken ground
A concrete angel laid right down
Upon the grave which swallows fast
It's peace at last
O peace at last


Empty they say
Death, won't you let me stay
Empty they say
Death, hear me call your name
Oh, call your name


Suicide, I've already died
You're just the funeral I've been waiting for
Cyanide, living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore


Forevermore
Forevermore
It's the funeral I've been waiting for
