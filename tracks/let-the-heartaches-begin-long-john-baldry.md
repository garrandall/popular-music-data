Let The Heartaches Begin

I can hear the guitars start to play
And very soon they say
I was a fool to turn my love away
And with each glass of wine I feel a glow
And very soon I know
I was a fool to let my baby go

So let the heartaches begin
I can't help it, I can't win
I've lost that girl for sure
And tears won't help anymore
So let the heartaches begin
I can't help it, I can't win
I've lost that girl for sure
Now she's gone
I can't hold back the tearsÂ
Anymore

I see the couples dancin' through the night
As they dance of love till the morning light
The soft embraces that they seem to share
Just make me feel aware
Of the lonliness I find so hard to bear

So let the heartaches begin
I can't help it, I can't win
I've lost that girl for sure
And tears won't help anymore
Yes let the heartaches, the heartaches begin
I just can't help it, you know that I just can't win

I've lost that girl for sure
And now that she's gone
I can't hold back the tears anymoreÂ
