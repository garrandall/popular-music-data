Put on my blue suede shoes
And I boarded the plane
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
In the middle of the pouring rain
W.C. Handy
Won't you look down over me
Yeah, I got a first class ticket
But I'm as blue as a boy can be

I'm walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet, ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
Do I really feel the way I feel

Saw the ghost of Elvis
On Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
Then I watched him walk right through
Now security they did not see him
They just hovered 'round his tomb
But there's a pretty little thing, waiting for the king
Down in the Jungle Room

Walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet, ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
Do I really feel the way I feel

They've got catfish on the table
They've got gospel in the air
And Reverend Green, be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer
Boy, you got a prayer in Memphis

Now Muriel, plays piano
Every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see her
And they asked me if I would
To do a little number
So I sang with all my might
She said, 'Boy are you a Christian child?"
And I said, "Ma'am, I am tonight'

Walking in Memphis
(Walking in Memphis)
Walking with my feet, ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
(Walking in Memphis)
But do I really feel the way I feel
Walking in Memphis
(Walking in Memphis)
Walking with my feet, ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
(Walking in Memphis)
But do I really feel the way I feel

Put on my blue suede shoes
And I boarded the plane
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
In the middle of the pouring rain
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
In the middle of the pouring rain
In the middle of the pouring rain
In the middle of the pouring rain
