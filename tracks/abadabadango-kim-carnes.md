Abadabadango, can you hear
It's the rhythm of the heart
That beats for a million years

We all have to use
Some kind of magic
Some of the time
Between the laughter and the tears
A place to draw the line

When they say that you can't
Say that you won't
So don't even give it a try

I know, hard as it seems
To take all your dreams
And give 'em just one more time

Abadabadango, can you hear
It's the rhythm of the heart
That beats for a million years

Abadabadango
Getting loud and clear
If you listen close to the voice inside
That you wait to hear

It's the time we spend awake at night
A dream that you've had before
Visions pounding in your head
That you just can't ignore

And are we sometimes blinded by
Stars get in our eyes
Break someone's heart, falling apart
Then start again one more time

Abadabadango, can you hear
It's the rhythm of the heart
That beats for a million years

Abadabadango
Getting loud and clear
If you listen close to the voice inside
That you wait to hear

Abadabadango, can you hear
It's the rhythm of the heart
That beats for a million years

Abadabadango
Getting loud and clear
If you listen close to the
Voice inside that you wait to hear

Abadabadango, can you hear
It's the rhythm of the heart
That beats for a million years
