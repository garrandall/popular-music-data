Let's get together and go for a walk in the park
And while we're walking we can steal a little kiss in the dark
I wanna walk with you
I wanna talk with you
But it's up you to say "Come on baby"
If you don't hurry up I'll go crazy
'Cause a walk in the park all alone is just no fun


What two can easily do, what two can easily do
Is so hard to be done by one


I'm sure that you know that I love you with all of my heart
But a love that's true really takes two to start
I wanna do my share
To show you that I care
'Cause a one-sided love will never do
You gotta show me that you love me too
'Cause falling in love all alone is just no fun


What two can easily do, what two can easily do
Is so hard to be done by one


One can build a love affair slowly
Two can build a love affair fast
One can make a love get started
Two can make it last


Come on and take me by the hand
Lead me up to the preacher man
Together we can do all the things that should be done


What two can easily do, what two can easily do
Is so hard to be done by one
