I never thought I'd try for the love of Ivy;
I never thought I'd cry for the love of Ivy.
Somebody hide me from the love, the love of Ivy.
It takes up all of your time to fall in love with Ivy.
(Here cometh Ivy...Ivy)

If I gathered all my means (all my means)
In a pile beside me (in a pile),
It wouldn't help to fill my dreams (fill my dreams)
For the love of Ivy.
Money cannot buy me -
Buy for me the love of Ivy.
I'm not the kind of guy who falls in love with Ivy.

Ivy...
For the love of (Ivy)...for the love of Ivy, yeah.
For the Love of (Ivy)...for the love of Ivy, yeah.
Yeah, for the love of (Ivy)...for the love of Ivy...
Yeah, yeah...
For the love of Ivy...for the love of Ivy...
For the love of Ivy...for the love of Ivy...

If I gathered all my means
In a pile beside me,
It wouldn't help to fill my dreams
For the love of Ivy.
Somebody hide me,
From the love, the love, the love, the love...
It takes up all of your to fall in love with Ivy.

For the love of (Ivy)...for the love of Ivy, yeah.
(For the love of Ivy...)
For the Love of (Ivy)...for the love of Ivy, yeah, yeah.
(For the love of Ivy...)
Yeah, for the love of (Ivy)...for the love of Ivy...
(For the love of Ivy..)
Yeah, yeah...
For the love of Ivy...
(Ivy, darling, darling...)
For the love of Ivy...
(I would surely die for Ivy;
Darling, darling Ivy...)
Ivy, yeah...
For the love Ivy
(Ivy is the one that I adore..)
For the love of Ivy...
Ivy...
For the love of...
For the love of...
