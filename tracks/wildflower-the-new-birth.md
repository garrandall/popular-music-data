She's faced the hardest times you could imagine
And many times her eyes fought back the tears
And when her youthful world was about to fall in
Each time her slender shoulders bore the weight of all her fears

And a sorrow no one hears
Still rings in midnight silence, in her ears

Let her cry, for she's a lady
Let her dream, she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild

And if by chance that I should hold her
Let me hold her for a time
And if allowed just one possession
I would pick her from the garden, to be mine

Be careful how you touch her, she'll awaken
As sleep's the only freedom all that she knows
And when you walk into her eyes, you won't believe
The way she's always paying for a debt she never owes

And a silent wind still blows
But only she can hear, so she goes

Let her cry, for she's a lady
Let her dream, she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower, growing wild

Let her cry, oh, she's a lady
Let her dream, 'cause she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild
She's a flower growing wild, she's a flower growing wild
