Come at me
Many priests, the good things in there
Change all conditions in Heaven yes, Ae Ae
Black dark day
He made me feel something
You are every night I want to slowly slowly taste
My equality, how much love how to put it
I have only one angle
You seem to have ears, you feel my words
You can spend a long time in a very short time


You, you are a mechanic and made of iron
See how, coming soon
Simply pulse acceleration (Yes)
If you are interested in more than money
My mind is all necessary
I killed without problems


Quickly, I want to get rid of your throat
I will show you something in your ear
If you are not with me you will lose
Quickly, gently shared your clothes locked, I want to
Letâ€™s sign a labyrinth wall
And make plaintiffâ€™s regime (Growing, growing, growing)
Growing, growing plant


I see your chest hair, I want to be your objective
I want to see my face
Favorite Business (Favorite, a favorite child)
Vunerability to secure the Danger Zone
It also provokes your jealousy
A surname here is (Tell me, Dadi Derides)


If I ask to see the kiss gimme, I know your belief converted
Bucket I have sought for some time, mother, until today
I know your heart I decided to be honest
I know that the child is my right
How do you know what comes to my face?
I would, I wish, I want to know down the fullness of I love art
I am in a hurry, I want to go
First of all, surprise


By steps, soft and flabby stage, we are a bit stranded
I blame you for that, I see you are malice with delicacy
By steps, soft and flabby stage, we are a bit weak and needy
And its aesthetic is a conundrum but here I am on the mountain, oh yeah


Quickly
Retro, unknown, coastline, inside, profile, lit
"Or a blessing!" from the howling waves
So that my seal stays with you


Quickly
By steps, soft and flabby stage, we are a bit stranded
I want to see my face, favorite business (Favorite, a favorite child)
By steps, soft and flabby stage, we are a little bit stuck
It also provokes your jealousy, a surname here
Quickly
