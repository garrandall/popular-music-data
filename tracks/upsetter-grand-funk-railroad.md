She's a real upsetter
Least she's tryin' to all of the time, yeah
You know I just won't let her
Break this heart of mine
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ya-yeah

I got hip to her, yeah, right away boys
But my heart just led me along, yeah
I'm gonna' slip right away boys
'Cause I don't want to sing this song
All night long, oh yeah

Upsetter, got me layin' awake all night
Upsetter, like to make me cry, yeah
Upsetter, got me layin' awake all night
Upsetter, I'd be better to die

She'll be sorry when I leave her
She just won't know what to say, yeah
I can't hardly wait to leave her
I guess I'll be on my way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ya-yeah

Upsetter, got me layin' awake all night
Upsetter, like to make me cry, yeah
Upsetter, got me layin' awake all night
Upsetter, I'd be better to die
