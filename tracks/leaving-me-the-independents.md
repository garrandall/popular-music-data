Oh, darling
After all this time
You seem to me, girl
To be changing your mind

We don't talk no more
Like we used to do
What in the world
Has come over you

(Leaving me) oh, baby
(Can't be) tell me
(What you're telling me)
I wanna know (baby)

I heard somebody say
(Leaving me can't be)
You want your clothes back
(What you're telling me)
I want you to know (baby)

Lately, I felt that you
Avoided my conversations
You would turn on the TV
Didn't need the aggravation

I just don't know
I just don't know
What I've done to you
But whatever it is, child
I hope one thing can be true
And that is

(Leaving me can't be) ah
(What you're telling me)
(Can't be)

Sometimes I moan
(Leaving me can't be)
You don't know
(What you're telling me)
Don't know what
You're doing to me, baby
(Can't be) oh, lord

Girl, if you only knew what
Was going through my mind
You'd stop fooling around
And give me all your time

The best years I've had
I spent em all with you
If you left me one day
I'd be through

(Leaving me) I'm sick, baby
(Can't be) somebody, somebody
(What you're telling me)
Somebody know what I'm
Talking about out there (baby)

(Leaving me can't be)
I know it's gonna be like
(What you're telling me)
(Baby) I'm gonna be here
I'm gonna be here
With the neighbors

And you know how
The neighbors talk
Old Tom over there
He want you to
Leave me the house
And old Mary down there
She don't know what
She's talking about

She think I'm cutting
Up on you, baby...
