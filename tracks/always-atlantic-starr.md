Girl, you are to me
All that a woman should be
And I dedicate my life
To you, always

The love like yours is grand
It must have been
Sent from up above
And I know you'll stay this way
For always


And we both know
That our love will grow
And forever
It will be
You and me, hey


Ooh, you're like the sun
Chasing all of the rain away
When you come around
You bring brighter days

You're the perfect one
For me and you
Forever will be
And I will love you so
For always


Come with me, my sweet
Let's go make a family
And they will bring us joy
For always

Oh, boy
I love you so
I can't find enough ways
To let you know
But you can be sure I'm yours
For always


And we both know
That our love will grow
And forever
It will be
You and me, hey


Ooh, you're like the sun
Chasing all of the rain away
When you come around
You bring brighter days

You're the perfect one
For me and you
Forever will be
And I will love you so
For always




Ooh, you're like the sun
Chasing all of the rain away
When you come around
You bring brighter days

You're the perfect one
For me and you
Forever will be
And I will love you so
For always


Ooh, ooh
I will love you so
For always
Ooh, ooh
I will love you so
For always
Ooh, ooh
I will love you so
For always
