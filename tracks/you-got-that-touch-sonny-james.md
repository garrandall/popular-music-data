YOU GOT THAT TOUCH
WRITERS SONNY JAMES, RICHARD HOLLINGSWORTH
A teenage touch
A teenage touch
A teenage touch
Is a touch I love
You, you, you
You, you, you
You, you
You got that touch
A teenage touch
A touch I love
Is a teenage touch
Not too young
Not too old
Oh no, just right
Oh yeah
She got that touch
A teenage touch
Crewcut hair and blue suede shoes
Makes a guy look keen
Seventeen and old blue jeans
Makes a goddess queen
When she got that touch
A touch I love
A touch I love
Is a teenage touch
Stroll baby
Bop baby
Love so much
You got that touch
A teenage touch
A touch I love
Is a teenage touch
Just my style
Not too bold
Love you so
Oh yeah
She got that touch
A teenage touch
Is a touch I love
Crewcut hair and blue suede shoes
Makes a guy look keen
Seventeen and old blue jeans
Makes a goddess queen
When she got that touch
A touch I love
A touch I love
Is a teenage touch
