I thought for the rest of my life
You'd see me through it
Guess all along I knew it
Nothing mattered everything was all right
When you saw to it
Before I knew it you were gone, long gone
You said you would always be there
Well I believed you
I was a fool to need you
Gave my love then I gave you my heart
And then you flew it
Before I knew it
You were gone, long gone


Hard facing another day
Just crying the night away
Said more than I meant to say
When I knew that you were gone


I thought for the rest of my life
You'd see me through it
Yes all along I knew it
Didn't matter and it didn't seem right
And then you flew it
Before I knew it you were gone, long gone
You were gone, long gone
