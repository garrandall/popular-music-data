Oh, yeah, mmm, oh, yeah

Oh, baby, you know
Just what I'm thinking of
And you, baby
You can be my deepest love
So won't you tell me

(Who) who am I thinking of loving
(Who) who am I showing all my love too
(Who) who am I sharing my life with
Tell me what I need to know



1-2-3, this love was meant to be
4-5-6, baby, this is it
You and me, sharing love so easily
Oh, oh, in my heart I know it's real

You, baby, you know exactly
What I'm dreaming of, oh
With you, oh, yeah
There could never be a doubt
So won't you tell me

(Who) who am I thinking of loving
(Who) who am I showing all my love too
(Who) who am I sharing my life with
Tell me what I need to know



You, baby, I cannot resist your touch, oh
For you, there could never be no doubt
So tell me

(Who) who am I thinking of loving
(Who) who am I showing all my love too
(Who) who am I sharing my life with
Tell me what I need to know



1-2-3 (oh, oh, oh, yeah) 4-5-6
You and me sharing love so easily
Oh, yeah, in my heart I know it's real

1-2-3, 4-5-6
