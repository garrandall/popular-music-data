If you feel that you can't go on
'Cause all your hope is gone
And your life is filled with confusion
And hapiness is just an illusion
And your world around is tumblin' down
Darling, reach out
Reach out, reach out

I'll give you all the love you need
I'll be there
You can always depend on me

I can tell by the way you hang your head
Your with out of love, now you're afraid
And through your tears you look around
But there's no peace of mind to be found

I know what you're thinking
You're alone now, no love of your own
Darling, reach out
Reach out for me boy

I'll give you all the love you need
I'll be there
Hey baby, I'm gonna be right there
You can always depend on me

You can always, depend on me
You can always, when things get tough
You can always, cuddle mee, see you through
You can always, depend on me
Whatever else you do

You can always, ring my phone
Yeah, you can always catch me at home
You can always cuddle me
You can always depend on me
You can always depend on me
You can always depend on me
You can always depend on me
You can always depend on me
You can always depend on me
You can always depend on me
You can always depend on me
You can always depend on me

When you're lost and about to give up
'Cause your best ain't good enough
And you feel the world has grown cold
And you're driftin' on your own
When you need a hand to hold
When you need a little love

Reach out, I'll be there
Reach out, I'll be there
Reach out, I'll be there
To give you all the love you need
I'll try ro give you all the love you need
I'll be there to love and shelter you

I'll be there to always see you through
To give you all the love you need
I'm gonna give you all the love you need
I'll be there to love and shelter you
I'll be there to always see you through
To give you all the love you need
I'm gonna give you all the love you need
I'll be there...
