She's my Monica Lewinsky
She gon' bust it right here, 'cause it's whisky
She got a code like DaVinci
Only gotta' text one time that you miss me
She goin' hard to resent me
'Cause me and her best friend got history
She got the walk of the century
Girl you really got some kind of entrance

I don't want no smoke
I don't wanna' learn to drive in a Rarri'
If you gon' tell me to go slow
I don't wanna' think by the life that we could've had
Live in the past of the snowglobe
But you little vent Chanel braids
Make up for the time wasting
Go slow when you hit the Matrix
I don't mind loco, I don't wanna' almost get rich and turn back
Baby girl, nah, nah, I'm only so close
I don't wanna' lay here alone in the mansion
The world feels cold when the door close
Wanna know my open mistaken
Even though I been waitin', girl I'm impatient

She's my Monica Lewinsky
She gon' bust it right here, 'cause it's whisky
She got a code like DaVinci
Only gotta' text one time that you miss me
She goin' hard to resent me
'Cause me and her best friend got history
She got the walk of the century
Girl you really got some...

We're appearing in the cycle
I'm no good at no wifey
She kiss me with her eyes close
That just mean that she likes me
I'm the good in goodbyes though
It's the way that it might be
I'm was tryna go Micheal, she was tryna go Hifey


Yeah, bang loud, yeah
I don't wanna talk about it late at night, nah, I want it right now
Ex nigga tryna hit you up still, tell that nigga "Pipe down"
And I don't wanna be the one to put more guns, but I don't fight now
Yeah, you know that I don't fight now
Just wasn't even my time before, but you're my type now
I ain't gonna lie that you're wrong, kinda dig you right now
Whatever I did in the dark before, is in the light now
Whenever you say you're leaving me, I know you be right back
Whenever I say it baby, I just hope that you don't believe it
I told you that could be a star if you can reach it
I told you that you could tell me all your little secrets
Told you that could tell me all if you needed
If you needed, 'cause-


She's my Monica Lewinsky
She gon' bust it right here, 'cause it's whisky
She got a code like DaVinci
Only gotta' text one time that you miss me
She goin' hard to resent me
'Cause me and her best friend got history
She got the walk of the century
Girl you really got some kind of entrance

We're appearing in the cycle
I'm no good at no wifey
