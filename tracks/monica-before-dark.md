M-O-N-I-C-A
Trying to take my man away from me (ooh)
M-O-N-I-C-A
She trying to take my man away from me, uh

1 - Monica, Monica, Monica,oh Monica
Stalking and hawking and jocking
And she follow ya
What she don't know
Is that I went and followed ya
Somebody gotta let her know
Monica, Monica, Monica,oh Monica
Stalking and hawking and jocking
And she follow ya
What she don't know
Is that I went and followed ya
So I'm about to let her know

First time she paged you
I let it slide, huh
But then he went behind my back
And let her spend the night
I went out of town So she thought
I caught the chicken at the crib with my nuh
They knew that they were caught

2 - What do I do? (Do)
What do I say? (Say)
How should I feel?
I'm ready to blaze
You got me ready to blaze

Repeat 1

He took my car
And went for a drive
Can't believe that he had a girl
Shotgun in my ride
How did I know that she'd been there?
I found her picture and a letter she wrote
And six strands of her hair

Repeat 2

Repeat 1

Yo I won't ever trust my man
He's a dog fa'sure
And what I'll never understand
He wants me to be his girl
And once she punched him in the face
Even tried to play me out
I can not let him get away
Cause I know what she's about

Repeat 1

La, la, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la

Repeat 1

Oh...
