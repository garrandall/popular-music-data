I woke up this morning
With this feeling inside me that I can't explain
Like a weight that I've carried
Been carried away, away
But I know something is coming
I don't know what it is
But I know it's amazing, you save me
My time is coming
And I'll find my way out of this longest drought


It feels like today
I know it feels like today I'm sure
It's the one thing that's missin'
The one thing I'm wishin'
The last sacred blessin'
It feels like today
Feels like today

You treat life like a picture
But its not a moment frozen in time
It's not gonna wait
Til you make up your mind, at all

So while this storm is breaking
While there's light at the end of the tunnel
Keep running towards it
Releasing the pressure, that's my heartache
Soon this dam will break



Feels like, feels like your life changes
Feels like feels like your life changes

It's the one thing that's missin'
The one thing you're wishin'
The last sacred blessin'
Feels like today

Feels like
Feels like your life changes
Feels like
Feels like your life changes
