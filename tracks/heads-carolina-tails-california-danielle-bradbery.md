Baby, what do you say, we just get lost
Leave this one horse town like two rebels without a cause
I've got people in Boston, ain't your daddy still in Des Moines?
We can pack up tomorrow, tonight, let's flip a coin

Heads Carolina, Tails California
Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
Where it don't matter, as long as we're goin'
Somewhere together, I've got a quarter
Heads Carolina, Tails California

We can load what we own in the back of a U-Haul van
Couple of modern day Moses' searchin' for the promised land
We can go four hundred miles before we stop for gas
We can drive for a day and then we'll take a look at the map

Heads Carolina, Tails California
Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
Where it don't matter, as long as we're goin'
Somewhere together, I've got a quarter
Heads Carolina, Tails California

We're gonna get outta here if we gotta ride a Greyhound bus
Boy, we're bound to outrun the bad luck that's tailin' us

Heads Carolina, Tails California
Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
Where it don't matter, as long as we're goin'
Somewhere together, I've got a quarter
Heads Carolina, Tails California

Ohh, California
