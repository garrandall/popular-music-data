Boys talkin' down
On the sidelines watching wishin' they was playin' the game we playin'
But its all good though
Paul Wall Brooke what up baby


What it do Paul Wall
Look who's talkin'


OK I hear the commentators on the side chatter boxing
Paul Wall and Brooke got all the paparazzi watching
I hear them jaw japing bumping guns chasing crones
We ain't concerned with them bums we accumulating funds
Plastic wrist we got the Johnny Dang watch froze 5 kid yellow stone in my earlobe
I'm squashing chatter when the light hit the pinky ring
Starch and clean white puff with the lean
See me in the new Benz cause I'm oh so ballin'
Or a old school slab with the few wheels fallin'
We got em talkin' but really they ain't saying too much
Just speculating the gossip truth is they don't know about us


I see your lips moving but I don't hear nothing
Everybody talking like they really know something about us
But they don't know nothing about us
I see your lips moving but I don't hear nothing
Everybody talking like they really wanna know about us
But they don't know nothing about us

(Talk to 'em Brooke)


I'm just trying to live but your all up in my grill
How's a girl to breathe with all the media starring down my mouth
With a four inch lens I just wanna hit the mall with some of my friends


They talkin' 'bout us so I guess were doing something right
Ballin' in the mix with the camera lights shining bright
They know we caked up but they don't know how much we worth
people clear the ceiling off because we getting work


Picture yourself up in my shoes
Top story in the news
Everyday its something new
Everybody's watching you
But they ain't seen nothing
They Ain't heard nothing
Everybody's just fronting its what they do


I see your lips moving but I don't hear nothing
Everybody talking like they really know something about us
But they don't know nothing about us
I see your lips moving but I don't hear nothing
Everybody talking like they really wanna know about us
But they don't know nothing about us

Stop stop stop
I'm not listening
You can save your breath
I don't wanna hear the rumors people are spreading
Why, why do people go
Out of there way
To try to bring us down
They wanna know about us

I see your lips moving but I don't hear nothing
Everybody talking like they really know something about us
But they don't know nothing about us
I see your lips moving but I don't hear nothing
Everybody talking like they really wanna know about us
But they don't know nothing about us
