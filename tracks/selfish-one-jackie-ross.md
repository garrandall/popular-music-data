Selfish one why keep your love to yourself
Oh oh yeah
It's like a souvenir that just sits on a shelf
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
It seems like you built a fence around your heart and afraid that sharing
Might tear it apart and ya pass up every chance at the start of romance oh
Oh oh oh oh Selfish one why keep your love in store oh oh yeah you think
It's steel that will keep forever more oh oh oh oh oh but steel wears out
Through weather and age and a heart could break down in a lonely stage you
Better let your heart down mate, before it's too late

You let so much time pass by, and I find myself still giving you the eye
Then you must have realized, cause much to my surprise you're making eyes
At me Is it really you?

Now, selfish one you're walking me to my door
Oh oh yeah
Selfish one, you never did this before
Oh oh no
Without a chance to resist, your lips met mine
You begin to let your lovelight shine
And I can see that you're really on the ball, and
You're not selfish at all
No-o-o, not at all
No-o, the way you hold me
Oh oh yeah, the way you squeeze me
No you're not selfish, no no no
You're not selfish at all
Oh oh oh, not at all
No-o the way ya kiss me
Don't ya know that I love the way ya hold me yeah
No-o-o not at all, no-o-o not at all, no-o-o not at all
