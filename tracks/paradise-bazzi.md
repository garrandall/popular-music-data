One, two, three, four

Hands on your body
I'm grabbing your ass
Enjoying the moment
'Cause life move too fast
I'm looking forward, ignoring the past
These are the times that we'll laugh looking back
I'm getting lucky like coins in the well
Goodbye to my haters I'm wishing you well
This is my year man if you couldn't tell
This is our life and we're living it well

Late nights in the city causing hell
Burn this bitch into the ground, oh well
If all we got tonight, let's do this right
Let's do this right

Let's go to (Paradise)
This shit be like Friday nights
This shit make me feel alive
I feel like we in paradise, paradise (Paradise)
Don't know if it's the drink I poured
But I swear I've never loved you more
With you right here I come alive
One more hit and we can fly
This shit feel like (Paradise)

I'm feeling it
My head's where the ceiling is (Oh yeah)
This energy
Turns nights into memories (Oh yeah)
Count up the bands, you've been working all summer
X didn't know what he had, what a bummer
Insecure people turn to insecure lovers
Well my drink is almost out and I'm about to pour another

Just let it out
The night has just begun, we on a level now
If I get too fucked up, promise you'll hold me down
Yeah, this that shit you can't deny
This that shit you feel inside
This our life, our time, we living well

Late nights in the city causing hell
Burn this bitch into the ground, oh well
If all we got tonight, let's do this right
Let's do this right

Let's go to (Paradise)
This shit be like Friday nights (It do, it do)
This shit make me feel alive (Yeah)
I feel like we in paradise, paradise (Paradise)
Don't know if it's the drink I poured
But I swear I've never loved you more
With you right here I come alive
One more hit and we can fly
This shit feel like (Paradise)
