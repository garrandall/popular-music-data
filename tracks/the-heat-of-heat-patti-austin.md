In the heat of heat
The heat is so hot
My body takes control
In the heat of heat
The heat gets so hot
My passion overloads


A lonely room until you walked in
Too positive to ignore
This sensual curiosity
Affecting me like no other has before


I see your face
And chills run up and down my legs
I hear your voice
My passion's pumping through my veins

I feel your touch
The heat is driving me insane
I lose control
I think I wanna love you

And I don't think I'll ever stop
No, I don't


In the heat of heat
The heat is so hot
My body takes control
In the heat of heat
The heat gets so hot
My passion overloads


You're touching me with hands of fire
Just comes naturally
I'm not easily hot
You just hit the spot
Nothing to prove
I know you've got a lot


I see your face
And chills run up and down my legs
I hear your voice
My passion's pumping through my veins

I feel your touch
The heat is driving me insane
I give in
I think I wanna love you

And I don't think I'll ever stop
No, I don't


In the heat of heat
The heat is so hot
My body takes control
In the heat of heat
The heat gets so hot
My passion overloads
(My passion overloads)

In the heat of heat
The heat is so hot
My body takes control
In the heat of heat
The heat gets so hot
My passion overloads
(Oh oh oh )

And I don't think I'll ever stop
No, I don't


Is it love?
(In the heat of heat)

Or is it lust
(In the heat of heat)


Ah ah ah ah
(Ah ah ah ah )

Don't think I'll ever stop

I see your face
Chills run up and down my legs
Baby, yeah, ooh
I hear your voice
My body takes control

In the heat of the heat
I feel your touch
Heat is driving me insane
Hoo, hoo, hey
Yeah, ooh, ooh

I lose control
I think I wanna love you, babe
Mmm mmm
Don't you know
The heat is so hot


In the heat of heat
The heat is so hot
(My body takes control)
My body takes control
(In the heat of the heat)

In the heat of heat
The heat gets so hot
(In the heat of the heat)
My passion overloads
(My passion overloads)

My body takes control in the heat of heat
The heat of heat
(The heat of heat
The heat of heat)
