Honey said she want somebody break her off proper (mhm)
Man, she so relentless so nothing can stop her (woo)
Never left the city (come on, man)
But she swear she's a yardie (hey girl)
It's 'cause it's so awesome how she move her body (ow)

She do the sangria wine (woo), sangria wine (uh-huh)
Moving side to side (woo), front and behind (uh-huh)
Sangria wine (woo), sangria wine (uh-huh)
Sangria wine (woo), do the sangria wine (uh-huh)

Move it, I move it
Move my body like it is a pipe
Tutti Frutti, is all that I got
Counter-clockwise, I'm mixin' it up (mixin' it up)
Sip it, sip it, I'll bet that you'll blush

Yo sé, yo sé, yo sé, yo sé que tú quieres mi cuerpo, eh
Y quieres controlar mi mente, eh
Y todo el mundo quiere ser dueño de ella
Pero nadie puede, ¡ay!

Honey said she want somebody break her off proper
Man, she so relentless so nothing can stop her (woo)
Never left the city (come on, man)
But she swear she's a yardie (yeah!)
It's 'cause it's so awesome how she move her body

She do the sangria wine (woo), sangria wine (uh-huh)
Moving side to side (woo), front and behind (uh-huh)
Sangria wine (woo), sangria wine (uh-huh)
Sangria wine (woo), do the sangria wine (uh-huh)

(Uno) Wait a minute
(Dos) Wait a second
(Tres) ¿Qué, qué?
Total sauce (woo)

Let's float around like the fruit at the top (huh)
In Miami, where winters are hot

Yo sé, yo sé, yo sé, yo sé que tú quieres mi cuerpo, eh
Y quieres controlar mi mente, eh
Y todo el mundo quiere ser dueño de ella
Pero nadie puede, ¡ay! (noo)

Honey said she want somebody break her off proper
Man, she so relentless so nothing can stop her
Never left the city (come on, man)
But she swear she's a yardie (hey darling)
It's 'cause it's so awesome how I move my body

She do the sangria wine (woo), sangria wine (uh-huh)
Moving side to side (woo), front and behind (uh-huh)
Sangria wine (woo), sangria wine (uh-huh)
Sangria wine (woo), do the sangria wine (uh-huh)

¿Qué, qué?
