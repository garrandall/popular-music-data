Without a warning you broke my heart
Takin' it, baby, tore it apart
And you left me standin' in the dark
Said your love for me was dyin'

Come on, baby, baby, please 
Come on, baby, 'cause I'm on my knees
Turn on your lights let it shine on me
Shine on your love light
Let it shine on me 
Let shine, let it shine, let it shine

When I get lonely in the middle of the night
And I need you, darlin', to make things all right

So come on, baby, baby, please 
And I'm beggin' you, baby, 'cause I'm on my knees
Turn on your lights, let it shine on me
Turn on your love light, let it shine on me
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine

Without a warning, you broke my heart
Takin' it, baby, tore it apart
And you left me standin' in the dark
Shine your love for me was dark

Come on, baby, baby, please
Come on, baby, 'cause I'm on my knees
Turn on your lights let it shine on me 
Shine on your love light
Let it shine on me 
Let shine, let it shine, let it shine
