Without a warning
You broke my heart
You took it, darling
And you tore it apart

You left me sitting
In the dark, crying
You said your love
For me was dying

I'm begging you, baby
Baby, please
I'm begging you, baby
Baby, please

Shine on your light
Let it shine on me
Turn on your light
Let it shine on me
Let it shine, shine
Shine, let it shine

I got a little lonely
In the middle of the night
I need you, darling
To make things all right

Come on, baby
Come on, please
Come on, baby
Come on, please

Shine on your light
Let it shine on me
Just a little bit higher
A little bit higher
Just a little bit higher
A little bit higher

I'm begging you, baby
I'm on my knees
I want you to
Turn on your light
Let it shine on me

Come on, baby
I'm begging you
Shine on your light
Let it shine on me

I feel alright
I feel alright
I feel alright
I feel alright

Turn on your love light
Let it shine on me
Turn on your love light
Let it shine on me

Let it shine
Let it shine...
