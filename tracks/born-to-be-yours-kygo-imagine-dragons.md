I know I've given up
A hundred times before
But I know a miracle
Is not something to ignore

You take me for a fool
You take me for a fool

I never knew anybody til' I knew you-ooh
I never knew anybody til' I knew you-ooh
And I know when it rains, oh, it pours
And I know I was born to be yours
I never knew anybody til' I knew you-ooh
I never knew anybody til' I knew you-ooh
And I know when it rains, oh, it pours
And I know I was born to be yours

Are you the only one
Lost in the millions?
Or are you my grain of sand
That's blowing in the wind?

I never knew anybody til' I knew you-ooh
I never knew anybody til' I knew you-ooh
And I know when it rains, oh, it pours
And I know I was born to be yours
I never knew anybody til' I knew you-ooh
I never knew anybody til' I knew you-ooh
And I know when it rains, oh, it pours
And I know I was born to be yours

(I was born to be yours
I was born, born, born, born
I was born to be yours
I was born, born, born
I was born to be yours
I was born, born, born, born
I was born to be yours)

Born to be yours
I was born, born, born, born
I was born to be yours
I was born, born, born
I was born to be yours
I was born, born, born, born
I was born to be yours
I was born
