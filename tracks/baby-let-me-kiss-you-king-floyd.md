Y'all niggas gonna see, y'all niggas gonna see
I kept shit street, ain't nothing to a G
Niggas faked on me, still letting niggas eat
We don't do the same things, everybody ain't kings
Bow down kiss the ring
Fuck nigga, bow down kiss the ring
Cause everybody ain't kings
Y'all ain't fuckin with me, y'all ain't fuckin with me
Everybody ain't kings
Y'all niggas gonna see, y'all niggas gonna see
You ain't fuckin with me, you ain't fuckin with me
You ain't fuckin with me
Bow down kiss the ring
Fuck nigga, bow down kiss the ring
Cause everybody ain't kings


Ugh, I'm Baltimore city in the flesh
40 thousand dollar rolly while I'm sittin in the jet
Thinking damn, I was just a lil nigga in the 'jects
Man they checkin like Beckham cause I kick it with the best
I'm a mess, I could cop it soft, whip it with the left
How you want it nigga, we could front it, bitch we did it best
I'm a rider, I just gotta say this shit, it's on my chest
You ain't living what I'm living man, it's different when we flex
When we flex, you don't get a rest, we don't get impressed
You don't get a chance to talk about it, you don't get it yet
It's a bet, I be bossin', flossin' in Cali, in Gucci, I'm awesome
Often in valley, tell em ship em off to the loft in the valley
We used to pitch raw duck laws in the alley
Now we big boy watchin', big boy's watchin'
Droppin' chips, calling coppin' whips toy shoppin'
PacquiÃ¡o flexin' like its roids we poppin
It's the undefeated Roy, this is Floyd meets Hopkins
Hoppin' out on me, I'm like boy what's poppin'
This is prophecy, properly destroy these mockery's
Moppin' up the floor with these boys, whose stopping me
You need more options I squeeze on niggas
You gon' need more doctors to bring more oxygen
B'more quite and keep on watchin' em


Y'all niggas gonna see, y'all niggas gonna see
I kept shit street, ain't nothing to a G
Niggas faked on me, still letting niggas eat
We don't do the same things, everybody ain't kings
Bow down kiss the ring
Fuck nigga, bow down kiss the ring
Cause everybody ain't kings
Y'all ain't fuckin with me, y'all ain't fuckin with me
Everybody ain't kings
Y'all niggas gonna see, y'all niggas gonna see
You ain't fuckin with me, you ain't fuckin with me
You ain't fuckin with me
Bow down kiss the ring
Fuck nigga, bow down kiss the ring
Cause everybody ain't kings


Ugh, diamond bezel on the rose gold Aude
Fish bowl lenses on the all gold Carty's
Got a hood rat in Harlem and a SoHo Barbie
They love to blow dro in a ocho gnarly
Known to go hard when my foes go hardly
Pull up to the party on a rose gold Harley
Soldier and I'm slim bitch slow-mo for me
Pack a four four to keep a bozo off me
Coffee, couldn't wake these boys up
I'm creative but I couldn't make these stories up
Niggas destroyed, they be on the decoy stuff
Heard your baby mama charge a little fee for a fuck
She a flea, you a mutt, I'm a big dog baby
I'm the reason a lot niggas getting pissed off lately
Pull up in a drop top with a thick dark baby
I've been ballin' ten years, I'm a crystal baby
I've been getting it, where were you
My theory is Theraflu, clearly I bury you
When you hear me, it worry you
Never you ran with the werewolves
I wear wolf, man look
There ain't even shit to compare me too
You barley knew that I was barely new and I'm really not
I rarely do what niggas really do and you really not
Trying to understand one funny little thing
I got four words formed for the twenty fourteen


Y'all niggas gonna see, y'all niggas gonna see
I kept shit street, ain't nothing to a G
Niggas faked on me, still letting niggas eat
We don't do the same things, everybody ain't kings
Bow down kiss the ring
Fuck nigga, bow down kiss the ring
Cause everybody ain't kings
Y'all ain't fuckin with me, y'all ain't fuckin with me
Everybody ain't kings
Y'all niggas gonna see, y'all niggas gonna see
You ain't fuckin with me, you ain't fuckin with me
You ain't fuckin with me
Bow down kiss the ring
Fuck nigga, bow down kiss the ring
Cause everybody ain't kings


Ugh, you now rockin' with a West side nigga
I'm just tryna do it big like the best out nigga
Remember big homie copped the S5 nigga
Never imagined I'd be on private jets my nigga
I was down, bad, stressed my nigga, real shit
I was stuck up in the  my nigga
Looking for any momentum I could catch my nigga
But every moment realizing that I'm blessed my nigga
Why am I so surrounded by death my nigga
Why the fuck the feds have to catch my nigga
But it triggered, something bigger inside of me
Every time these wicked niggas done lied to me
Like I ain't the lottery ticket nigga obviously
I'm the nigga that struggled and hustled and doubled his shit
Until he could get into the mother fuckin driver seat
And now I'm ridin', I dare a nigga collide with me, ugh
I'm climbin peaks, you climb and peek, I'm classic
I'm classified to climb a peak, the points I passed is past the point
The pastor pointed out I'm past the point of rhyming deep
Even options is obsolete and obstacles ain't even
So ours ain't stopping me, this is prophecy
And I ain't talking lifestyles of the rich and famous
When I say these niggas Robin Leach, ugh
I strive to teach, they fail to learn, stomp through hell, the frail gon' burn
Apply your skill, the fire's real, niggas will let it ring like a fire drill
In church last Sunday and I can hear the choir still
In my head while I'm lying still, but fuck lying still
These niggas lie and steal, actin' like this what I ain't build
But my reply is still


Now who gon' hold ya down, yeah
Who gon' hold ya down
If I leave right now, right now
Yeah, yeah, yeah who gon' hold it down
You know I hold it down
Who else gon' roll around
Top down, rep the town, hold it down
So treat me like a fuckin king in this bitch
Tell me I'm the king of this shit
Who else gon' roll around
Top down, rep the town, hold it down
Treat me like a fuckin king in this bitch
Tell me I'm the king of this shit
Treat me like a fuckin king in this bitch
Tell me I'm the king of this shit


I'm experienced now, professional
Jaws been broke, been lost, knocked down a couple of times, I'm bad
Been chopping trees
I done something new for this fight
I done wrestled with an alligator
That's right, I have wrestled with an alligator
I done tussled with a whale
I done handcuffed lightning, thrown thunder in jail, that's bad
Only last week, I murdered a rock, injured a stone, hospitalized a brick
I'm so mean I make medicine sick
Bad dude
Bad, fast, fast, fast
Last night I cut the light off in my bedroom
Hit the switch and was in the bed before the room was dark
Incredible
I'm a show you how great I am
All you chumps are gonna bow
