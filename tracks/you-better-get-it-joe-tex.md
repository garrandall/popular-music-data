You asked me
Do I love you
That's a silly question
Listen

If I didn't love you
Would I call every day
If I didn't love you
Would I act this way

So why do you ask
Do I really love you
When it's really so clear
Even strangers can see that I do

If I didn't love you
Would I worry so
Each and every moon
When you come and you go

So just ask yourself
Would I waste my time
If I didn't love you
Would I hope and pray
You'd be mine

Oh, baby, oh, baby
Oh, oh, oh, mmm

If I didn't love you
Would I miss you this much
Put heart and soul to rot
Just for your touch

Would I be a sling
And a fool for your charm
If I didn't love you
Would I be right here in your arms

(If I didn't love you, love you)
Baby (if I didn't love you, love you)
Sweet (if I didn't love you, love you)
