I hear thunder
Looks like the rain
Is gonna start falling
Rain, falling from the sky

Rain, rain, rain, a wicked rain
Falling from the sky
Down, down, down, pouring down
Upon the night
Well there's just one chance in a million
That someday we'll make it out alive

Rain, rain, rain an evil rain
Falling all the time
Sun, sun, sun, sun
Don't you ever want to shine
Well there'll be no light in the morning
Till some peace at last we find

Like travellers in the darkness
Can't see our way
Trying hard to make it through
Another day

Father, father, father
Why do you let your sons go astray
Brother, brother, brother
Why must we go on this way
There's a storm off in the distance
And it looks like it's here to stay

I was the third brother of five
Doing whatever I had to do to survive
I'm not saying what I did was alright
Tryin' to break out of the ghetto
Was a day to day fight

Bein' down so long
Getting' up didn't cross my mind
But I knew there was a better way of life
And I was just tryin' to find
You don't know what you're doin'
Till you're put under pressure
Across 100 and Tenth Street
Is a hell of a tester

Across 100 and Tenth Street
Pimps tryin' to catch a woman that's weak
Across 100 and Tenth Street
Pushers won't let the junkie go free
Across 100 and Tenth Street
A woman tryin' to catch a trick on the street
Across 100 and Tenth Street
You can find it all

Hey Brother, there's a better way out
Snorting that coke, shooting that dope
Man, you're coppin' out
Take my advice, it's either live or die
You gotta be strong if you wanna survive
The family up on the other side of town
Will catch hell if I don't get around
In ev'ry city you'll find the same thing goin' down
Harlem is the capital of ev'ry ghetto town

Across 100 and Tenth Street
Pimps tryin' to catch a woman that's weak
Across 100 and Tenth Street
Pushers won't let the junkie go free
Across 100 and Tenth Street
You can find it all

Across 100 and Tenth Street
Let the sun, let the sun shine down
Across 100 and Tenth Street
Like travellers in the darkness
Can't see our way
Across 100 and Tenth Street
Trying hard to make it
Make it through another day
Oh, stop the rain
Somebody stop the rain
Across 100 and Tenth Street
A little more love and a little less pain
