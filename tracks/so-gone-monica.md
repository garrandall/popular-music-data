So gone over you, you, you, you
Yeah, new Monica
Woo


Silly of me (Uh huh), devoted so much time
To find you unfaithful, boy
I nearly lost my mind (Oh
Drive past your house every night (Uh)
In an unmarked car (Uh huh)
Wonderin' what she had on me to make you break my heart (Yeah)


You make me feel
You make me feel, I'm so gone
So unreal
You make me feel
You make me feel
Oh, and I love to love you, baby
So unreal


Nights I couldn't sleep
Ah, you let the sun beat you home
I ask myself over again
What am I doin' wrong
To make you stay out all night (Uh uh) and not think to call?
What does she have over me (Uh huh)
To make you not think to call home?


You make me feel
You make me feel, I'm so gone
So unreal
You make me feel
You make me feel
Oh, and I love to love you, baby
So unreal


Listen boy, I'm a rowdy chick
Sometimes I have to fight 'cause my mouth too slick
Baby, why you doin' me like I ain't worth shit?
Make me wanna ride past your house and sit
Kick down your doors and smack your chick
Just to show you Monica not havin' that
So in love with you like a drug habit get
(So unreal)
You treat me so unreal


What she do, I do better
What she did to make you love her?
(What did she do?)
Is it real or forever?
Ohh (Is it real)?
Baby, please can we stay together?
What she do, I do better (Yeah, yeah)
What she did to make you love her?
Is it real or forever?
(Is it real?)
Baby, please, can we stay together?


Whoa and I love to love you, baby
Whoa and I love to love you, baby
Whoa and I love to love you, baby (Ohoh, oh)
Whoa and I love to love you, baby
Whoa and I love to love you, baby
Whoa and I love to love you, baby
Just to show you Monica, not havin' it


You make me feel
You make me feel, I'm so gone
So unreal
You make me feel
You make me feel
Oh, and I love to love you, baby
So unreal


Said that I need you
I don't really need you
Said that I need you (Oh-oh, oh)
Said that I need you
I don't really need you
Said that I need you
You treat me so unreal
