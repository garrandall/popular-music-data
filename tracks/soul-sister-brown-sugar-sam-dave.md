Oh, you're sweeter than the honey that the bees make
Soul sister, you're brown sugar
Sweeter than the icing on the best cake
Soul sister, you're brown sugar

I was in the dark but now I see
What was always in front of me
I was always proud
But now I'm saying it loud
Keep on giving it to me

Love and affection to the bone, to the bone
Soul sister, you're brown sugar
Keep on socking it to me all night long
Soul sister, you're brown sugar

Girl, you're always there with your man
It's 'bout time he took your hand
I wanna show you
'Cause I can't stand the blow
Keep on giving it to me

Somebody said, "What's in the dark
Will surely come to the light"
Now your days are brighter
And your burden's lighter
And the whole world knows you out of sight

Wooh lord
Love and affection to the bone, to the bone
Soul sister, you're brown sugar
Keep on socking it to me all night long
Soul sister, you're brown sugar

Girl, you're always out there with your man
It's about time he took your hand
I wanna show you
'Cause I can't stand the blow
Keep on giving it to me

Keep on giving me brown sugar
I got to have it
I just got to have brown sugar
You know what baby, huh

I can't help but more brown sugar
You're brown to the bone
Don't you know I need brown sugar
Oh lord, yeah

I just got to have brown sugar
You sweeter than icing on a cake
I just got to have brown sugar
