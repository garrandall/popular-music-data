When you see some puddles on the ground
You lay down, so she don't have to walk around
You think that will protect her from the rain
But you'll never ever stop the pain

She walks all over you
You know she can, she knows she can
You're the carpet man, you're the carpet man

You take such care to keep that girl's feet clean
Like she's some kind of figurine
The world's so far below her, it's not her scene
And so she uses you to stand between

She walks all over you
You know she can, she knows she can
You're the carpet man, you're the carpet man

I would think you'd get tired of hurtin'
Every now and then
It's no good down there, that's for certain
And carpets do get thin

And that's when they have to be thrown away
That's what she'll say to herself, some sunny day
And she'll say, "Come to my wedding" and of course you do
And then the groom and her will have a dance on you

She walks all over you
You know she can, she knows she can
You're the carpet man, you're the carpet man

Carpet man
Carpet man
Carpet man
Carpet man
