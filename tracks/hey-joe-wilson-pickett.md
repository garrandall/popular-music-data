Everybody get on your feet
You make me nervous when you in your seat
Take off your shoes and pat your feet
We're doing a dance that can't be beat
We're barefootin' now, yeah
Yeah, all night long now, listen

Went to a party the other night
Long Tall Sally was out of sight
Took off her wig, and high heel sneakers too
She the dance without any shoes

She was barefootin' now
Yeah, baby
Yeah

Hey little girl with your red dress on
Bet you can barefoot all night long
Take off your shoes and throw 'em away
Come back and get them another day

We're barefootin' now
That's what we doin' baby
Yeah
All night long

Only barefootin' tonight
Listen

Lil' Joe Henry he said to Sue
"If I barefoot, would you barefoot too?"
Sue told Joe, "I study too
I was barefootin' ever since I was two"
We're barefootin', yeah
Yeah, yeah
Baby
All night long

Baby
Yeah
Take off your shoes
Oh yeah
Take off your shoes, baby
Get that groove
