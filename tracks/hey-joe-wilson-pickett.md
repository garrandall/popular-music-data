Hey Joe
Where you goin' with that gun in your hand?
Hey Joe
Where you goin' with that gun in your hand?

Goin' down to shot my old lady
You know I caught her mess around with another man
Goin' down to shot my old lady
You know I caught her mess around with another man
That ain't too good

Hey Joe
Heard you shot your woman down
Hey Joe
Heard you shot your lady down

Yes I did, I shot her
You know, I caught that girl mess around town
Yes I did, I shot her
You know, I caught that girl mess around town
I took out my gun, then I shot her

I shot her

Hey Joe
Where you gonna run to now?
Hey Joe
Where you gonna run to now?
Where you gonna go?

Goin' way down south way down to Mexico way
Goin' way down south way down where I can be free
Ain't no hangman gonna get a rope around me
Ain't no hangman gonna get a rope around me
