Yeah, yeah
TK Kravitz
Oh yeah, oh


I'm lying if I said I didn't want it
I can tell by your eyes that you focused
(That you focused, yeah)
Come and hop on this pony
(Come and hop on this pony)
Now can I dive in your ocean?
(Your ocean)
Can I take a dive in your ocean?
(Yeah, yeah)
Can I take a dive in your ocean?


Uh, I swear I'm drowning, yeah, I'm drowning, yeah, I'm drowning, babe
You fuck me good and I mean good 'til I'm lazy, babe
Never had no pussy like yours, it got me crazy, babe
It got me crazy babe, uh
I'm in your ocean, it got me floating, it got you talking shit
It got me slapping on that ass like I'm owning it
And when I'm gone, you call my phone and say I'm wrong for this
That pussy good, they might catch on to this
I'm in my zone for this, might write a song for this
Used to drinking Hennessy but I need Patron for this
Yeah, I gotta be strong for this, my name, she moaning it
And if you feeling like I'm feeling, just admit it, baby, yeah


I'm lying if I said I didn't want it
I can tell by your eyes that you focused
(That you focused, yeah)
Come and hop on this pony
(Come and hop on this pony)
Now can I dive in your ocean?
(Your ocean)
Can I take a dive in your ocean?
(Yeah, yeah)
Can I take a dive in your ocean?


Yeah, I need your attention, yeah, I know the last nigga failed the mission
You like the shower or the kitchen, yeah, I would be a fool if I didn't listen
Uh, hit it from the back, then I hit it from the side in the morning
Yeah, and the way you calling my name, baby, I can tell that you want it (tell that you want)
Am I pleasing you right? Is it me that you like?Only me, in your thighs, waterfalls, I'ma dive
You scratching my back, I'm all in no cap
Only thing I speak is facts, all facts, yeah


I'm lying if I said I didn't want it
I can tell by your eyes that you focused
(That you focused, yeah)
Come and hop on this pony
(Come and hop on this pony)
Now can I dive in your ocean?
(Your ocean, your ocean)
Can I take a dive in your ocean?
(Ocean, yeah, your ocean, yeah, your ocean)
Can I take a dive in your ocean?


I swear I'm drowing, yeah, I'm drowing, yeah, I'm drowing, babe
I swear I'm drowing, yeah, I'm drowing, yeah, I'm drowing, babe


Can I dive in your ocean?
(Ocean, your ocean, your ocean, your ocean)
Can I take a dive in your ocean?
(Ocean, your ocean, your ocean, your ocean)
Can I take a dive in your ocean?
