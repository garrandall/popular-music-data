(The world on drugs)
Ten (Yeah) thousand dollar plates
(Thousand dollar plates)
Thousand dollar plates, fine china
Shorty like it
(Shorty like it)
Wheezy outta here


Shorty like a thousand dollar plate, fine china
Tell her that she beautiful every day, I remind her
Then I jump in her pussy like a lake, I'm a diver
And her last man was a pussy had a vagina
I get lost in her eyes like dust from the sky
It's her body or nobody, I refuse to compromise
So if she leaves, I'ma kill it all, she'a die
Did I say that out loud? I'm so crazy about mine

Goin' insane
Feel you pickin' up and movin' things inside my brain
I know I don't have to argue about everything
But we don't have the same soul
Would've sold it too 'til we got a bigger bankroll
You tell me that you love me, baby, say it again
Repeat it over and over until it's in my brain
Picked up the drugs, so I'll let my brain go
Would've fried yours too, but I'm selfish about my Percs, oh

Shorty like a thousand dollar plate, fine china
Tell her that she beautiful every day, I remind her
Then I jump in her pussy like a lake, I'm a diver
And her last man was a pussy had a vagina
I get lost in her eyes like dust from the sky
It's her body or nobody, I refuse to compromise
So if she leaves, I'ma kill it all, she'a die
Did I say that out loud? I'm so crazy about mine
(Wheezy outta here)


I'm so crazy about mine
I'm goin' to Pluto with my girl (Oh, shorty)
I'm goin' to Jupiter with my girl (Fuck all your exes)
I'm goin' to Mars with my girl (Fuck all your exes)
I'm goin' to Saturn with my girl

I've been feelin' like I'm runnin' outer space
You need to send your location, I can't think
I done fell in love twice but I gotta be lyin'
'Cause I'm livin' ten lives, I go crazy about mine, said


Shorty like a thousand dollar plate, fine china
Tell her that she beautiful every day, I remind her
Then I jump in her pussy like a lake, I'm a diver
And her last man was a pussy had a vagina
I get lost in her eyes like dust from the sky
It's her body or nobody, I refuse to compromise
So if she leaves, I'ma kill it all, she'a die
Did I say that out loud? I'm so crazy about mine

Did I say that out loud? I'm so crazy about mine
