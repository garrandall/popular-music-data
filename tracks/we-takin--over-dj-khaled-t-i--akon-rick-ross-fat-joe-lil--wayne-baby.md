Oh, oh


DJ Khaled!


Konvict Music, yeah


We the best
We takin' over
Listen!


Ay, ay
Started in Atlanta, then I spread out wit' it
South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi
On to North Carolina, Philadelphia and Virginia
From down in Miami where it warm in the winter
On up to Minnesota where it storm in the winter
Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Memphis, Tenn. holla at me
Me in H-Town, Southside, Cloverland daddy
I'm the man out in Dallas, better ask Khaled
Kept me out in Cali with my eyes open barely
Blowin' and spinnin', goin' down Bennett
Drop six-fo', three-wheel then switch it
Red light stop, make it drop for the bitches
Got a glock fo'-fifth, blow your head off wit' it
Anything you hear that I said, I meant it
King got the crown then sped off it wit' it
Say you need bricks, I said I get it


If you want to, we can supply you
Got enough work, to feed the whole town
They won't shoot you, unless you try to
Come around and try to stomp on our ground
'Cause we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time


Triple C, Black Flag
We rich, yeah


Listen!


Boss, it's what I does
I get money everyday, everyday I does
That Benz, is how I ride
Black flag on the left, two hoes and ride
You better, move! Ak all day
Get shot up like Shyne, that's on my neck
I'm (B.I.G.) like Diddy
Damn it, I'm wit' it
Khaled we did it, Biggie of my city
Please no fitted, fuck it, I'm too pretty
The rappers can get brain, stupid, I'm silly
Money that come, runnin' like water
Mami so hot, damn it, she gorgeous
Miami on fire, you better be, cautious
Might get shot on the porch of your fortress
Now they see that you know I'm from Port City
I run in 'cause Rick Ross is boss shit


'Cause we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time


Cribs Mania
Khaled!
BX, TS nigga


Listen!


Blat, when you see Crack, better duck
like the mac gotta ease past, nigga what
Shit, I don't give fuck, I run these streets
Y'all talk that shit, I want that beef
I'm a tell you like a g told me
They'll come back quick if a nigga O.D
Cash Rule Everything Around Me
I'm YSL, Versace
You could see me in that Porsche GT
Comin' down Sunset, sittin' on D's
Feelin' like 'Pac, All Eyes On Me
Fresh bandanna and I'm blowin' mad trees
Nigga please, I spit crack every verse a ki
Some say Khaled, some say Khalid
Twelve years down and I'm finally free, crack!


If you want to, we can supply you
Got enough work, to feed the whole town
They won't shoot you, unless you try to
Come around and try to stomp on our ground
'Cause we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time


Listen!


Birdman daddy, I'm number one
Nigga came at me wrong so we got him done
Fuckin' with the fam', I'm gonna give him some
Spent that corner, he didn't run
Sunday had a whole church singin' a song
"Why'd they have to send my baby home?"
Fuckin' with some nigga, that paper long
Been a g in the game now my son on the throne


I am the beast
Feed me rappers or feed me beats
I am untamed, I need a leash
I am insane, I need a shrink
I love brain, I need a leech
Why complain on easy streets?
I don't even talk, I let the Visa speak
and I like, my sprite easter pink
And my wrist special pah but the Mula's cooler
I have more jewels than your jeweler
Touch and I will bust your medulla
That's a bullethole, it is not a tumor
Red light! Red light! Stop your rumors
I stay on track like a box of Pumas
Now just r-r-rock with Junior
I am the little big Kahuna, y'dig?


'Cause we takin' over, one city at a time
