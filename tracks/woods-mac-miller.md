Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, things like this ain't built to last
I might just fade like those before me
When will you forget my past?
Got questions, ask, you know the stories

And you need to let me know
When you're leaving, where you go
Can I come?
Do you believe me, are you close?
Yeah, even if you don't
That I'll get you sprung

Do I, do I, do I love?
Can I, can I, can I get enough?

Yeah, don't run away, love
Hey love, heartbreak will have you bankrupt
Too many days in a daze, better wake up
I put your face in a place where the space was
Nobody make you feel like you but (Do I?)
And you don't know what you should do
You just looking for someone to make you move, ohtell me (Do I?)

I make this planet feel like home
Miss us, first time the door is closing
So far beyond all our control
You say it's all so close to broken

It's so much better when you wait
Forever and a day, that's all I got
Put it together then it breaks
All the energy it takes, it never stop

Do I, do I, do I love?
Can I, can I, can I get enough?

Yeah, I never slip, I never fall
I tried to tell you 'bout a better life
And get involved, big or small
It's been my fault I keep it safe, it's in the vault
Blindfold her, keep it going till we hit a wall
I'm never going through the motions
I'm just tryna lay your body down slowly
We can only go up, we can only go up

Do I, do I, do I love?
Can I, can I, can I get enough?
