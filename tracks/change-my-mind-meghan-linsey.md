Was it all just pretend back then when
You said you loved me for me?
Cause lately it seems the girl of your dreams
Is someone that I can't be
Oh but I try
And oh I cry


You want me to change
See things your way
It's easy to see, I'm losing me
One little piece at a time
Oh baby I've tried
But this is my life
Boy you want me to change
Baby I'll change, my mind


Well I used to believe you knew better than me
But now I'm the one in control
And I might make mistakes but I'll make 'em my way
I won't pay with a piece of my soul
You made it clear
I had to decide


You want me to change
See things your way
It's easy to see, I'm losing me
One little piece at a time
Oh baby I've tried
But this is my life
Boy you want me to change
Baby I'll change, my mind
