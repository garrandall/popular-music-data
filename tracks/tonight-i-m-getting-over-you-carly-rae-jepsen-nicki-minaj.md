This is the remix, Carlyyyyy


I want to smash your fears
And get drunken off your tears
Don't you share your smile with anyone else but me
I wanna touch your heart
I wanna crush it in my hands
Make you plead and cry, as you give up all the lies


We're not lovers, but more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more crying to get me through
I'll keep dancing 'til the morning with somebody new
Tonight, I'm getting over you


Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Over you, over you


Stuck in a real bad dream
And man, it feels so new to me
Should be in your arms, but I'm begging at your feet
It's been a real hard night and I just hold my pillow tight
It won't love me back, no, it's not you and I


We're not lovers, but more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more crying to get me through
I'll keep dancing 'til the morning with somebody new
Tonight, I'm getting over you


Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Over you, over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Over you, over you


We're not lovers, but more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more crying to get me through
I'll keep dancing 'til the morning with somebody new
Tonight, I'm getting over you


Tonight, I'm getting over
Meditate and do my yo-ger
Then I pull up to the club in a Rover
A celine bag on my shoulder
I said rrrrrr
Cock that, revolver
Rrrr-rrrr that's that nostal-ger
I said I'm number one, I'm a son a gun
And runner up is what they called ya
Ain't trying to be mean but, I am the queen, yuh
Ain't fuckin' with no fuck boys!
Get me get me, should've got me then
Cause I would wear 4 real and you would rock pretend
Yo, can I get another dose of my oxygen
Cause I been breathin' all this motherfuckin' toxin in!


Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Over you, over you


We're not lovers, but more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more crying to get me through
I'll keep dancing 'til the morning with somebody new
Tonight, I'm getting over you
