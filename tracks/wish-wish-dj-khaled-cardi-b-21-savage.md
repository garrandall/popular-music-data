(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up!)

Cardi, Cardi bops, Cardi, Cardi in the spot (We The Best Music)
Cardi from the block, Cardi with the Glock
Cardi, yeah, Cardi, yeah, Cardi(Another one)
(DJ Khaled!)

They say my time is almost up
Tell them bitches, "Wish, wish"
All these hoes looking cold, all these bitches fish sticks
Put a ribbon on my box 'cause this pussy gifted
I ain't got no free time, all my shit expensive
See my ring, my watch, my chain and everything is lit-lit (Ice)
All this gold on a bitch, I feel like I'm Slick Rick
If they love me or they hate me, it don't make no difference (Cardi)
It be hard not to kill a hoe 'cause I be tempted

Now I be countin' money, buyin' jewelry, hoes be riding dick (Dick)
I just make my M's and mind my business, hoes be riding dick (Dick)
"I can see Cardi eat so much" and that's what got 'em sick
But I wonder how they still ain't pregnant, all that riding dick
Y'all better go ahead with that weak shit
I'm certified real street bitch
Won't be a song if I leak shit
We strapped up like defense
Whatever you do sis, keep it cute sis
Leave that beef and shit at Ruth Chris or end up toothless
I been official my whole life
I bought burners, I ain't buy lights
How lil' ol' me gettin' money got everybody all tight
These bitches whack, bitches garb', they diss me, I disregard
Bet you if I had a dick these bitches couldn't get it hard

They say my time is almost up
Tell them bitches, "Wish, wish" (wish)
All these hoes looking cold, all these bitches fish sticks
Put a ribbon on my box 'cause this pussy gifted
I ain't got no free time, all my shit expensive
See my ring, my watch, my chain and everything is lit-lit (Ice)
All this gold on a bitch, I feel like I'm Slick Rick
If they love me or they hate me, it don't make no difference (Cardi)
It be hard not to kill a hoe 'cause I be tempted


Bought a Richard Mille, I could've bought me a house (No joke)
Feel like I'm the greatest rapper came out the South (Who want smoke?)
She keep tryna fuck, I told her, "top me for now" (On God)
She got ass shots, I told her work on her mouth (Straight up)
Everybody talkin' this king talk, nigga we shoot shit up, we don't battle (Bitch)
Quarrel 'bout nigga, ye ain't get no money, we don't give a fuck about your talents (Snitch)
Came from the bottom, I'm a multi-millionaire, I was just sleepin' on pallets (21)
Fuck these rappers, I'm 4L gang, we the best like DJ Khaled (Straight up)
Your bitch got that crazy head like a Kanye tweet (21)
Had a wedding for my Glocks, call 'em J and B (21)
I split the rent with my chopper 'cause it stay with me (On God)
Leave you drunk like a shot of liquor, ain't no chasing me (On God)

He threw in a white flag, but I still want beef (Stupid)
Catch you at your album release, you play with Cardi B (Shoot it)
Made this pistol blow both ways, I call it Hennessy (Bow!)
I know your mamma taught you look both ways 'fore crossing me
Lil' bitch


They say my time is almost up
Tell them bitches, "Wish, wish" (wish)
All these hoes looking cold, all these bitches fish sticks
Put a ribbon on my box 'cause this pussy gifted
I ain't got no free time, all my shit expensive
See my ring, my watch, my chain and everything is lit-lit (Ice)
All this gold on a bitch, I feel like I'm Slick Rick
If they love me or they hate me, it don't make no difference (Cardi)
It be hard not to kill a hoe 'cause I be tempted


(We The Best Music!)
(What's that on your wrist?)
(I call her a chandelier)
(Another one)
