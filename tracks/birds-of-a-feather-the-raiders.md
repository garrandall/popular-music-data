I remember back a long time ago, in the days of my childhood 
In the evenin' when the sun was sinkin' low, walkin' in the wildwood 
Skippin' and flippin' through the flowers, we'd go hand-in-hand 
Lookin' back on all the happy hours, anyone one could understand 
You and me, babe, sure 'nough got to be, babe 

Birds of a feather, na na na na na na na na 
We should be together like 
Birds of a feather, na na na na na na na na 
Got to be together like birds of a feather 

You and I didn't have a lot of friends, didn't have too much to say 
So they never would let us join in all the games they used to play 
Seems like it was only yesterday, all the thinkin's you and I 
I remember what the kids used to say as we'd go strollin' by 
You and me, babe, sure 'nough got to be, babe 

Birds of a feather, na na na na na na na na 
We should be together like 
Birds of a feather, na na na na na na na na 
Got to be together like birds of a feather 

Time goes rollin' by, and they say that you and I 
Must go our separate ways 
But birds of a feather will always be together 

Your folks didn't want me hangin' 'round, said that I was bad for you 
So we'd meet on the other side of town, down a long dark avenue 
But they can't keep the 2 of us apart long as you really love me 
I got a feelin' way down in my heart, that's the way it's gonna be 

Birds of a feather, na na na na na na na na 
We should be together like
