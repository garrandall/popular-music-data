Why cry when she tells you she's leaving?
A teardrop or two won't keep her loving you
Be grateful she's gone, no more to lead you on
Only fools want to try living a li-i-i-ie

You can't change her mind with your grievin'
It's wrong to pretend, let it end
This first love may die but you've still got time, give it one more try
And that's better than living a lie

You don't have to cry when you kiss her goodbye
You can find someone else if you give it a try
Somebody else with a heart so true
That she'll never, never, never stop loving you

Be grateful she's gone, no more to lead you on
Only fools want to try living a li-i-i-ie

I know that you're sad but it's not so bad
When you think of the heartaches you might've had
She's only a flirt with a rovin' eye
Let her go, don't you know you're a lucky guy?

This first love may die but you've still got time, give it one more try
And that's better than living a lie
And that's better than livin' a lie
