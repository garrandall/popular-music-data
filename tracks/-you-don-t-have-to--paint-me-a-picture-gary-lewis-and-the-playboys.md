You don't have to paint me a picture
The handwriting's on the wall
It's very plain to see that you don't love me
No, you never loved me at all

You went out with other fellas
You think that I don't know
Well, you don't have to paint a rose on me
'Cause I knew it long ago

I have tried to make excuses for the things you do
I've tried to be fair in every way
It's no use pretendin' that you haven't been untrue
It's over now, so I'll be on my way

I don't need a fortuneteller
I don't need a crystal ball
It's very plain to see that you don't love me
No, you never loved me at all

I have tried to make excuses for the things you do
I've tried to be fair in every way
It's no use pretendin' that you haven't been untrue
It's over now, so I'll be on my way, hey hey

I don't need a fortuneteller
I don't need a crystal ball
It's very plain to see that you don't love me
No, you never loved me at all

You don't have to paint me a picture
The handwriting's on the wall
It's very plain to see that you don't love me
No, you never loved me at all

You don't have to paint me a picture
The handwriting's on the wall
It's very plain to see that you don't love me
No, you never loved me at all
