Seems this world has got you down
You're feelin' bad vibrations 'round
Well, open your eyes, girl, look at me
I'm gonna show you how it ought to be

We're gonna have a good thing
Such a good thing, baby
And when your world don't seem just right
And life's gettin' you uptight
You can change that wrong to right
'Cause I was there myself last night

Girl, I really had a good thing
Such a good thing, baby
I, I, I won't have no one now
No one around to bring you down
Well it's a groovy world, girl
Let me bring you to a good, good, good, good thing girl

Gotta hear me, you can't please them all, should you try
They don't care if you live or die
'Cause they're losers, what a shame
I'm gonna show you to a brand new game
Girl, we're gonna have a good thing
Such a good thing, baby

I won't tell you no, no, no, no lies
When I threw you realise
For the first time it seems so right
I'm gonna stay right here tonight

We're gonna have a good thing
Such a good thing, baby
I know 'bout it
No one around to bring you down

Well, a groovy world, girl
Let me bring you to a good, good, good, good thing
Such a good thing, girl

Good thing, baby
Good thing, baby
Good thing, baby
Good thing, baby

Good thing, baby
Good thing, baby
Good thing, baby
Good thing, baby

Good thing, baby
Good thing, baby
Good thing, baby
