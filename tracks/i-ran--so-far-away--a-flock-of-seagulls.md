I walk along the avenue
I never thought I'd meet a girl like you
Meet a girl like you
With auburn hair and tawny eyes
The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through
You hypnotize me through


And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day
I couldn't get away


A cloud appears above your head
A beam of light comes shining down on you
Shining down on you
The cloud is moving nearer still
Aurora Borealis comes in view
Aurora comes in view


And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day
I couldn't get away


Reached out a hand to touch your face
You're slowly disappearing from my view
'Appearing from my view
Reached out a hand to try again
I'm floating in a beam of light with you
A beam of light with you


And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day
And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I couldn't get away
