(What would the music be without sounds)


Young Boss, Miss Trina, Pitbull
Let's show them how we keep down

I party like a rockstar,
Look like a movie star,
Play like an all star,
Fuck like a pornstar,
Baby I'm a superstar,
Always posted at the bar
Always with a couple broads
Maybe I'm just that that raw
Dawg check your resume
I hit something everyday
Ask about me n' they say
That chico run M.I.A
Pitbull and young boss
That's fire
Go girl work it out
'Til u tire
Just tryin' to pay your tuition
Liar
My corner is like HBO's wire
So please don't play no games
And baby don't say no names
And we can do this one more again
Next time you can bring your friends

So go get your friends
And I get my friends
And we can be friends
Do this every weekend


We can hit your place
We can hit my place
She's on my top 8
I bagged her off of myspace


Go girl 
Shake them dice and roll them 
When they ask u what's that dance
U say that's the hustle man


Girl I wanna know your name
Girl who u be?
Don't care with who you came
As long as u leave wit' me
What's you sippin' on?
I buy you a drink
Get u one of them shiny things
Your Girl pick pink
I see those Jimmy Choos
Those Vera Wangs
I luv the way u work
Girl do your thing
U see my stunna shades
I'm like a star
My click is full of ballas
We at the bar

So go get your friends
And I get my friends
And we can be friends
Do this every weekend


We can hit your place
We can hit my place
She's on my top 8
I bagged her off of myspace




Diamond princess
I make them bus quick
Man I back it up
Like a Mack Truck

Don't talk about it boy
Be about it boy
I got them girls boy
Turn out your girls boy
I'm talking freak nig
I'm talking freaky shit
Cause I'm a freaky bitch

So go get your friends
And I get my friends
And we can be friends
Do this every weekend



Go girl 
Shake them dice and roll them 
When they ask u what's that dance
You say that's the hustle man
