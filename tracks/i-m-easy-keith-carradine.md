It's not my way to love you
Just when no one's looking
It's not my way to take
Your hand if I'm not sure

It's not my way to let you see
What's going on inside of me
When it's a love you
Won't be needing, you're not free

Please stop pulling at my sleeve
If you're just playing
If you won't take the things
You make me want to give

I never cared too much for games
And this one's driving me insane
You're not half as free
To wander as you claim

But I'm easy, yeah, I'm easy
Give the word, I'll play your game
As though that's how it ought to be
Because I'm easy

Don't lead me on
If there's nowhere
For you to take me
If loving you will have
To be a sometime thing

I can't put bars on my insides
My love is something I can't hide
It still hurts when I recall
The times I've tried

I'm easy, yeah I'm easy
Take my hand and pull me down
I won't put up any fight
Because I'm easy

Don't do me favors
Let me watch you from a distance
Cause when you're near
I find it hard to keep my head

When your eyes throw light at mine
It's enough to change my mind
Make me leave my
Cautious words and ways behind

That's why I'm easy, yeah, I'm easy
Say you want me, I'll come running
Without taking time to think
Because I'm easy

Take my hand and pull me down
I won't put up any fight
Because I'm easy

Yeah, I'm easy
Give the word, I'll play your game
As though that's how it ought to be
Because I'm easy
