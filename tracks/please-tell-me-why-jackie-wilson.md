I tried so hard to make you stay
Now it doesn't matter what happens from day to day
I sit alone with tears in my eyes
Oh, please tell me why
Nights seem so long since youve been gone
I wonder why the feelin still lingers on
I sit alone with tears in my eyes
Please tell me why
Black dirt under my feet
Storm clouds over my head
All I do each and every night is just weep in my lonely bed
I sit alone with tears in my eyes
Please tell me why
