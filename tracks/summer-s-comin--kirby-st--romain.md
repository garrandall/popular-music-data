Summer's really coming
Summer's on it's way
No more hearing that school bell ring
School let out today
Summer's really coming
I got myself a date
Lots of swinging parties and having fun
I think I'm gonna stay out late
Spend all day at the swimming pool
Getting tan and keeping cool

Climb in we're gonna drive all over town
Spend all day at the swimming pool
Getting tan and keeping cool
Spend the whole day messing 'round
Climb in we're gonna drive all over town
Summer's really coming
Summer's on it's way
No more hearing that school bell ring
School let out today
