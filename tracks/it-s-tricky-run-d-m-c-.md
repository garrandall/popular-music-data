This speech is my recital, I think it's very vital
To rock (a rhyme), that's right (on time)
"It's Tricky" is the title, here we go...


It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's Tricky... it's Tricky (Tricky) Tricky (Tricky)
It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's Tricky... Tr-tr-tr-tricky (Tricky) Trrrrrrrrrrricky


I met this little girlie, her hair was kinda curly
Went to her house and bust her out, I had to leave real early
These girls are really sleazy, all they just say is please me
Or spend some time and rock a rhyme, I said "It's not that easy"


It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's Tricky... (How is it D?) It's Tricky (Tricky) Tricky (Trrrrrricky)
It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's Tricky... Tricky (Tricky) Tricky


In New York, the people talk and try to make us rhyme
They really (hawk) but we just (walk) because we have no time
And in the city, it's a pity 'cause we just can't hide
Tinted windows don't mean nothin', they know who's inside


It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's Tricky... (How is it D?) Tricky (Tricky) Tricky (Tricky)
It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's Tricky... Tricky (Tricky) Tricky (Tricky) huh!


When I wake up people take up mostly all of my time
I'm not singin', phone keep ringin' cause I make up a rhyme
I'm not braggin', people naggin' cause they think I'm a star
Always tearin' what I'm wearin', I think they're goin' too far
A girl named Carol follows Darryl every gig we play
Then D dissed her and dismissed her, now she's jockin' Jay
I ain't lyin', girls be cryin' cause I'm on TV
They even bother my poor father cause he's down with me


It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's Tricky... (How is it?) Tricky (Tricky) Tricky (Tricky)
It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's Tricky... Tr-tr-tr-tr-tr-tricky (Tr-Tr-Tr-Tricky) Tr-tr-tr...


We are not thugs (we don't use drugs) but you assume (on your own)
They offer coke (and lots of dope) but we just leave it alone
It's like that y'all (y'all), but we don't quit
You keep on (rock!) shock 'cause this is it...
