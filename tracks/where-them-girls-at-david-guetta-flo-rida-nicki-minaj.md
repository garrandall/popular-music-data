So many girls in here, where do I begin?
I see this one, I'm about to go in
Then she said, I'm here with my friends
She got me thinking and that's when I said
Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
So go get them, we can all be friends


Hey, bring it on baby, all your friends
You're the shit and I love that body
You wanna ball, let's mix it, I swear you're good, I won't tell nobody
You got a BFF, I wanna see that girl, it's all women invited
Hair do's and nails, that Louis, Chanel all up in the body
President's in my wallet, no rules I'm 'bout it
Blow the whistle for the hotties
I got it, shawty, it's never too much, can't be doing too much
10 to one of me, I can handle that love
Outta of my reach, we can all get buzz
Holla 'cause I'm free to whatever, it's no rush


So many boys in here where do I begin?
I see this one, I'm about to go in
Then he said I'm here with my friends
He got to thinking, then that's when he said
Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
So go get them, we can all be friends


Peebe, peebe, who's Peabo Bryson?
Two years ago I renewed my license
Anyway, why'd I start my verse like that?
You can suck on a dick, or you can suck on a ballsack
No no, I don't endorse that
Pause that, abort that
Just the other day mi go London, saw that
Kissing down the street, paparazzi, all that
Hey hey what can I say?
Day day day da-day day
Coming through the club, all the girls in the back of me
This ain't football, why the fuck they tryna tackle me?
Really?
I pick dude at the bar like really?
Looking like he wanna good time like really?
Said he had a friend for my home girl Lilly Lilly, Lilly, Lilly


So many girls in here where do I begin?
I see this one, I'm about to go in
Then she said I'm here with my friends
She got me thinkin', then that's when I said
Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
So go get them, we can all be friends


Day day day da-day day
Where my girls at uhh, hm, uhh
Where my girls at uhh, hm, uhh
Yo, where my girls at uhh, hm, uhh
Yo, where my girls tryna get to jumpin'


So many girls in here, where do I begin?
I seen this one, I'm about to go in
Then she said, I'm here with my friends
She got me thinking and that's when I said
Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
So go get them, we can all be friends
