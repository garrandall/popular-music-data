Feelin' good, can't be real, must be dreamin' 'bout my drivin' wheel.
Rollin' on, drivin' on, come to me and rock me all night long.
We've got a roll goin', too good to stop.
Flyin' high, we've got too far to drop.
Everybody needs somebody to love,
I've got you, and that's love enough.

You're my drivin' wheel - You're my drivin' wheel - You're my drivin' wheel

Powerful love, steady roll, move my body and it rock my soul.
Let me ride, let me slide, got that lovin' feelin', way down inside.
You got me walkin', goin' round and around,
You got me talkin', but I can't hear a sound.
Love comes easy when the going is tough,
May be crazy - I may be in love.

You're my drivin' wheel, yeah - You're my drivin' wheel, yeah -
You're my drivin' wheel, yeah.

Every night feelin' high, flyin' right, can't believe all the love that I feel.
Easy rider, you're a love exciter, you're my love, you're my drivin' wheel.



Feelin' good, can't be real, must be dreamin' 'bout my drivin' wheel.
Rollin' on, drivin' on, come to me and rock me all night long.

We've got a roll goin', too good to stop,
Flyin' high, we've got too far to drop.
Everybody needs somebody to love,
I've got you and that's love enough.

You're my drivin' wheel - You're my drivin' wheel, yeah -
You're my drivin' wheel.
Y-o-u-'r-e my drivin' wheel.

Keep on drivin' me baby - 'cause you're my drivin' wheel,
I love the way I feel - 'cause you're my - 'cause your my drivin' wheel.

Let me ride, let me slide, whoo!
C'mon baby, give it to me baby.
Yea we gotta ride, we gotta ride, we gotta ride, we gotta ride,
We gotta ride, ride, ride, yeah.
