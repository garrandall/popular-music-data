I'll be seeing you in all the old, familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, the chestnut tree
The wishing, wishing well

Well, I'll be seeing you
In every bright and summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the day is through
I'll be looking at the moon
I'll be seeing you

I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you
