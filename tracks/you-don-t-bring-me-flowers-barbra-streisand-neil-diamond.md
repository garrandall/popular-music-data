(Duet with Brabra Streisand)
Written by: Neil Diamond, Alan Bergman and Marilyn Bergman

You don't bring me flowers
You don't sing me love songs
You hardly talk to me anymore
When you come thru the door
At the end of the day

I remember when
You couldn't wait to love me
Used to hate to leave me
Now after lovin' me late at night
When it's good for you
And you're feelin' alright
Well you just roll over
And turn out the light
And you don't bring me flowers anymore

It used to be so natural
To talk about forever
But "used to be's" don't count anymore
They just lay on the floor
'Til we sweep them away

And baby, I remember
All the things you taught me
I learned how to laugh
And I learned how to cry
Well I leared how to love
And I learned how to lie
Well you'd think I could learn
How to tell you goodbye
And you don't bring me flowers anymore

Well you'd think I could learn
How to tell you 'goodbye'
You don't say you need me
You don't sing me love songs
You don't bring me flowers anymore
