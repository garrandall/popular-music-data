I've gotta get away from you fast as I can
Too much for me woman more than my heart could stand
Like a kid behind the wheel
You been reckless with my heart
If I stay around you sure to tear it all apart


Said the road's got to end somewhere, oh
Every road has got to end somewhere
Now is the time for the showdown
So let me give you the low down
We've come to the end of our road


Just think about all the nights you left me at home lonely
You only did it 'cause you know I loved you only
Runnin', 'round with every girl in town
I'm telling you boy no longer will I be your clown


Said the road's got to end somewhere
Said every road has got to end somewhere
Sick and tired of your stuff
Said enough is enough
We've come to the end of our road
Whoa


No, no, no
Somewhere baby I just got to go


You made more sense when you begged and you pleaded
Talkin' 'bout I'm the one you're needing
Said I done had my fill of you
Hurt me some through the years
I just broke up running out of tears
Tell you I couldn't cry if I wanted to


Said he road's got to end somewhere
Every roads got to end somewhere
Time and again I begged you to slow down
So I'm giving you the low down
We've come to the end of our road


(Take us to the end of our road)
I can't take baby
(This is the end of our road)
Oh yes it is yes it is
(This is the end of our road)
Whoa whoa whoa
(This is the end of our road)
I can't take it baby
