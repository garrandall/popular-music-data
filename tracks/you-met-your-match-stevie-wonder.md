Hey you were good at playing the fox girl
When I was good you threw me a bone
But I ain't playing hot for nobody
Girl just you wait 'til I get you home
I'll show you the way to love somebody
Like you've never ever been shown before

Cause my love light's burning
My whole life's yearning for you
Hey Baby you were playing the part with Jimmy and Freddie
You tried to make me look like a fool
But I took care of Cindy and Susie
Just to show you I can be twice as cool Baby

If you want to learn how to love me
I'll teach you in my own private school
Cause my love love lights burning
My whole life's yearning for you

You met you your match
When you play with my affection
You met you your match
When you tried to make me walk the line
When you decided you would hurt me
That's when your grape feel off the vine

Your mama told me that I better be mellow
She said you're just a baby maybe too green
I told her Jimmy, Freddie, Teddy and Victor
They know better
Mama shake off that dream
I told her that you were really cooking
My love is burning for a turn at the steam

Hey, cause
My love light's burning
My whole life's yearning for you
You met your match
When you told me you loved me
You met your match
When you told me that you wouldn't let go

You met your match 
Baby
You met your match 
Baby

You met your match in me..
