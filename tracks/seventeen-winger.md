Yeah, I saw sparks fly
From the corner of my eye
And when I turned
Oh, it was love at first sight

I said, please excuse me
I didn't catch your name
Oh, it'd be a shame
Not to see you again

And just when I thought she was comin' to my door
She whispered sweet and brought me to the floor
She said

I'm only seventeen (seventeen)
But I'll show you love like you've never seen
She's only seventeen
Daddy says she's too young, but she's old enough for me

Mmm, come to my place
We can talk it over
Oh, everything
going down in your head

She said take it easy
I need some time
Time to work it out
To make you mine

And just when I thought she was comin' to my door
She whispered sweet and brought me to the floor
She said

I'm only seventeen (seventeen)
You ain't seen love, ain't seen nothing like me
She's only seventeen
Seventeen

Such a bad girl
Loves to work me overtime
Feels good, ha
Dancing close to that borderline

She's a magic mountain
She's a leather glove
Oh, she's my soul
It must be love

I'm only seventeen (seventeen)
Girl, she gives me love like I've never seen
She's only seventeen (seventeen)
Daddy says she's too young, but she's old enough for me (seventeen)
She's everything I need (seventeen)
Daddy says she's too young, but she's old enough, old enough for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
