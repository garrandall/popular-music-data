I'm feelin' like Tonto
Ridin' a Pinto
Tryin' to chase the Lone Ranger down
I'm a little unravelled
But I'm still in the saddle
Cryin' your name out to the clouds
Hey yaw, Hey yaw!

Why don't you meet me
Back at the tepee?
We'll lay down by the camp fire
There, in the dark night
We'll smoke the peace pipe
Forget about who's wrong or right
Hey yaw, Hey yaw!

Yeah, it was a big showdown
Oh yeah, we stood our ground
Shot out the lights:
It got a little crazy
I don't wanna see us go
The way of the buffalo:
Don't wanna have another wild west show
Hey yaw, Hey yaw!

Only forgiveness
Will finally end this
There won't be a witness if we both fall
There's never a hero
In a battle of egos
There's never a winner of the quick draw
Hey yaw, Hey yaw!

Yeah, it was a big showdown
Oh yeah, we stood our ground
Shot out the lights:
It got a little crazy
Don't wanna see us go
The way of the buffalo:
Don't wanna have another wild west show
Hey yaw, Hey yaw!

Hey yaw, Hey yaw!

It's like a ghost town
Without you around
Why can't we just forget it
Ride off in the sunset?

It was a big showdown
Oh yeah, we stood our ground
Shot out the lights:
It got a little crazy
I don't wanna see us go
The way of the buffalo:
Don't wanna have another wild west show
Hey yaw, Hey yaw!

I'm feelin' like Tonto
Ridin' a Pinto
Tryin' to chase the Lone Ranger down
