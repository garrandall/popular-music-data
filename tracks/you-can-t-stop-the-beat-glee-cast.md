You can't stop an avalanche as it races down the hill
You can try to stop the seasons, but you know you never will
And you can try to stop my dancin' feet, but I just cannot stand still
Cause the world keeps spinnin' 'round and 'round
And my heart's keepin' time to the speed of sound
I was lost 'til I heard the drums, and I found my way
Cause you can't stop the beat...
Five, six, seven, eight!


Ever since this whole world began
A woman found out if she shook it, she could shake up a man
And so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it the best that I can today
Cause you can't stop the motion of the ocean or the sun in the sky
You can wonder, if you wanna, but I'll never ask why
If you try to hold me down, I'm gonna spit in your eye and say
That you can't stop the beat!


You can't stop a river as it rushes to the sea


You can try to stop the hands of time, but you know it just can't be!


And if they try to stop us, Artie, I'll call the NAACP
Cause the world keeps spinnin' 'round and 'round
And my heart's keepin' time to the speed of sound
I was lost 'til I heard the drums, then I found my way
Cause you can't stop the beat!
Ever since we first saw the light
A man and woman like to shake it on a Saturday night
So I'm gonna shake and shimmy it with all of my might today
Cause you can't stop the motion of the ocean or the rain from above
You can try to stop the paradise were dreamin' of
But you cannot stop the rhythm of two hearts in love to stay
Cause you can't stop the beat!


You can't stop today 
As it comes speeding down the track 
Child, yesterday is history 
And it's never comin' back! 
Cause tomorrow is a brand new day, and it don't know white from black 
Cause the world keeps spinning round and round
And my heart's keepin' time to the speed of sound
I was lost 'til I heard the drums, then I found my way
Cause you can't stop the beat!


Aah, aah, aah
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh!

Ever since we first saw the sun
A man and woman like to shake it when the day is done
So I'm gonna shake and shimmy it and have some fun today!
Cause you can't stop the motion of the ocean or the rain from above
You can try to stop the paradise we're dreamin' of
But you cannot stop the rhythm of two hearts in love to stay
You can't stop the beat!
You can't stop the beat
You can't stop the beat
You can't stop the beat
You can't stop the beat!!
