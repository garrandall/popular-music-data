Come on without
Come on within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn

So, come on without
Come on within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn

Everybody's building
Ships and boats
Some are building monuments
And others are jotting down notes
Everybody's in despair
Every girl and boy
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here
Everybody's gonna jump for joy

Come on without
Come on within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn

I like to go just like the rest
I like my sugar sweet
But jumping queues and making haste
Just ain't my cup of meat
Everyone's beneath the trees feeding pigeons on the limb
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here
All the pigeons gonna run to him

Come on without
Come on within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn

Now, come on without
Come on within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn

Let me do what I wanna do
I can't decide at all
Ah, just tell me where to put 'em now
And I'll tell you who to call

Nobody gonna get no sleep on everyone's toes
When Quinn the Eskimo gets here
Everybody's gonna wanna doze

Let me tell ya now
Come on without
Now, come on within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn

Yeah, come on without
Come on within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn

And now, come on without
Come on within
You'll not see
