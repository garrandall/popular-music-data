It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those, who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we could both live

If I were a sculptor, but then again no
Or a man who sells potions in a travelling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody, this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of those verses, you know what, make me cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote down this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting, but these things that I do
You see I've forgotten, if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is, what I, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody, this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
What I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
What I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
While you're in the world
While you're in the world
