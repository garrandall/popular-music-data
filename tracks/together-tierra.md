Oh, we could be on a desert
Lost without a place to go
But we are so in love
In love with each other
That we wouldn't even know
(Oh-oh, I) I don't care (I don't care)
Any place anywhere (anywhere)
(Just as long) just as long
(We are there) as we are there

Baby, baby
(Together) together, baby
(Together) together, baby
(Baby, just)
Baby, just you and me, yeah
Whoooa, how happy we'll be, yeah

Whoooa, we could be in poverty
With no one to lean a helping hand
But it's alright, (alright)
Alright I know
Because you always understand
(Oh-oh, I) I don't care (I don't care)
Any place anywhere (anywhere)
(Just as long) just as long
(We can share) as we share

Baby, baby
(Together) together, baby
(Together) together, baby
(Baby, just)
Baby, just you and me, yeah
Whoooa, how happy we'll be, yeah



(Oh-oh, I) I don't care (I don't care)
Any place anywhere (anywhere)
(Just as long) just as long
(As we are there) as we are there

Baby, baby
(Together) together, baby
(Together) together, baby...
(Together) I want to live my whole life with you
'cause loving you gal was easy (together)
Wanting you gal was easy
(together)
Loving you gal
Loving you gal
Oh, I want you by my side (yeah, yeah)

"Girl I want you to sit back and close your eyes. Think about all those wonderful times that we used to have together. Now I know things aren't the way they used to be right now, but they are going to get better some day and I know that."

And I remember (I remember)
When we used to play shoot'em up
(shoot'em up bang bang baby)

(Together) together, baby
(Together) together, baby
(Together) wanna live, wanna live, wanna live my life with you (baby)
Because I want you to be my wife you see (together)
Now give you everything, everything ...
