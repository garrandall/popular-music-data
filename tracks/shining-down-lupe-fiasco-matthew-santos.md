Look up in the sky 

You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn't around
That I left you alone

But look up in the sky
Just look up in the sky
See that I'm everywhere everywhere
Shining down on you


Well, well
Is that our little author?
Coming back, humming his hymns a little altered
Your attention
Put back on the flow like the department of water
Taking off with the dough like little Walter
Chess? Yes. Baby I'm Jerry Lawler
Rebel with a cause, outlaw with the lawyer
Judge jury like a loop, rap name Lupe
But my daddy named me Warrior
This is his memorial, shoot


You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn't around
That I left you alone

But look up in the sky
Just look up in the sky
See that I'm everywhere everywhere
Shining down on you


No, I ain't that nigga trying
To get a liquor line
When I be scripting lines
Want this petition signed
It says I'm sick of dying
Sick of this prison time
I really love my people
I'm sick of pimping mine

Now if we Auto-Tune that shit
We can hear the songs from that opera groomed fat bitch
Telling us not to pursue it, just to shoe it like a blacksmith
We're trapped, and moving round in circles like it's chapstick
And that's the same encircled way of thinking that we chat with
We'll wrap this around your head, like the bandannas Fabolous used to wrap his hats with
Rather be in F.E.D.S. instead of National Geographics
Well I'm not having it, naw


you thought I was down
you thought I was gone
Thought I wasn't around
That I left you alone

Well look up in the sky
Just look up in the sky
See that I'm everywhere everywhere
Shining down on you


So, I say hello and this is for the third time
To everybody out there who ain't never heard mine
And if you have, then you know you ain't never heard lying
Lu don't move. No cowards, you only heard/herd lines/lions

Not a facade cherisher, I'd rather have the scars
I don't idolize America, I'm dancing with the stars
Uh huh. All of them? Yeah, they are, too
You look up and you see us shining down on you


You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn't around
That I left you alone

But look up in the sky
Just look up in the sky
See that I'm everywhere everywhere
Shining down on you

Shining down on you
