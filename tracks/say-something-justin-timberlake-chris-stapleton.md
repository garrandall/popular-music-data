Oh
Yeah, alright
Oh

Everyone knows all about my direction
And in my heart somewhere
I wanna go there, still I don't go there

Everybody says, "say something that says something"
"Say something that says something", say something that says something
I don't wanna get caught up in the rhythm of it

But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it


Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have


Everyone knows all about my transgressions
Still in my heart somewhere
There's melody and harmony
For you and me, tonight
Whoa, I hear them call my name

Everybody says, "say something that says something"
"Say something that says something", say something that says something
I don't wanna get caught up in the rhythm of it

But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it


Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)


Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing

But I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it


Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)


Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing
