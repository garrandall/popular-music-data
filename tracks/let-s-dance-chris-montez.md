(One, two)
(One, two, three, four)

Hey baby won't you take a chance?
Say that you'll let me have this dance

Well let's dance, well let's dance
We'll do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you want to do
But let's dance, well let's dance

Hey baby, yeah, you thrill me so
Hold me tight, don't you let me go

But let's dance, well let's dance
We'll do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you want to do
But let's dance, well let's dance

OK, wail now. Oh, yeah
Hey, baby, if you're all alone
Maybe you'll let me walk you home

But let's dance, well let's dance
We'll do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you want to do
But let's dance, well let's dance

Hey, baby, things are swingin' right
Yes, I know that this is the night

Well let's dance, well let's dance
We'll do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you want to do
But let's dance, well let's dance

But let's dance
But let's dance
But let's dance
