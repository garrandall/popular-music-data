I wanna spread news all around
About the new love that I found
I found a love that I've been looking for
Now I don't have to look no more

Headline news, headline news
Everybody say
Extra, extra, read all about it
Extra, extra, read all about it

The world is at my feet
There's a halo around my head
I went out searching for gold
I found love instead

She's a wish, a dream come true
I guess you might say that I struck oil too

Headline news, headline news
Everybody say
Extra, extra, read all about it
Extra, extra, read all about it
Read all about it, read all about it

Headline news, headline news
Everybody say
Extra, extra, read all about it
Extra, extra, read all about it

In my neighborhood
They say, what a change in me
People say when I walk by
It's not hard to see

She brings out the best in me
Lights me up like a Christmas tree

Headline news, headline news
Everybody say
Extra, read all about it
Extra, extra, read all about it
Extra, extra, read all about it

One, two, one, two, three, four
