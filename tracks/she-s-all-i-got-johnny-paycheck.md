Well I say friend, don't take her she's all I've got
Please don't take her love away from me
I'm beggin' you friend, don't take her she's all I've got
She's everything in life I'll ever need

She is life when I wanna live
She's everything to me in life that life can give
She's my water when I need to drink
She's the first thought in my mind each time I try to think

Let me tell you now friend, don't take her she's all I've got
Please don't take her love away from me
I'm beggin' you friend, don't take her she's all I've got
She's everything in life I'll ever need

She's my fingers when I want to feel
She's the only thing in life to me that's really real
She is love she's all the love I know
She could kiss the ground in the wintertime and make the flower grow

Let me tell you now friend, don't take her she's all I've got
Please don't take her love away from me
I'm beggin' you friend, don't take her she's all I've got
She's everything in life I'll ever gonna need

Let me tell you now friend, don't take her she's all I've got
I'm beggin' to you friend, don't take her she's all I've got
I'm beggin' to you friend, don't take her she's all I've got
Let me tell you now friend
