Now I've had the time of my life
No, I've never felt like this before
Yes, I swear, it's the truth
And I owe it all to you


'Cause I've had the time of my life
And I owe it all to you


I've been waiting for so long
Now I've finally found someone to stand by me


We saw the writing on the wall
As we felt this magical fantasy


Now with passion in our eyes
There's no way we could disguise it secretly
So we take each other's hand
Cause we seem to understand the urgency


(Oh)


Just remember


You're the one thing


I can't get enough of


(I can't get enough of)


So I'll tell you something


This could be love


(This could be love)


Because


I've had the time of my life


(No, I've)


Never felt this way before


(Never felt this way)


Yes, I swear, it's the truth


(And I)


Owe it all to you


Hey, baby


Hey, baby
With my body and soul
I want you more than you'll ever know


So we'll


(Just let it go)
(Don't be afraid to lose control)


No


Yes, I know what's on your mind
When you say


(Stay with me tonight)


Stay with me
Just remember


(You're the one thing)


(I can't get enough of)


So I'll tell you something


This could be love


(This could be love)


Because


(I've had)


I've had the time of my life


(Yeah, yeah)


(No, I've)


Never felt this way before


(Never felt this way)


Yes, I swear, it's the truth


(And I)


Owe it all to you

Cause I've (*New Directions*: I've)
(Had) the time of my life (Yeah-ah!)
(And I've) searched through every open door (*New Directions*: Every open door)
Til I found the truth (It's the truth)
(And I) owe it all to you


Now I've


(I've)


Had the time of my life
No, I never felt this way before


(Never felt this way)


Yes, I swear, it's the truth
And I owe it all to you


(Oh woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)


I've


(I've had)


The time of my life


(Of my life)


(No, I've)


Never felt this way before


(Never felt this way)


Yes, I swear


(Yes, I swear)


It's the truth


(It's the truth)


(And I)


(Owe it all to you)


Cause I've had the time of my life


(Had the time of my life)


(And I've)


(Searched through every open door)


(Every open door)


Til I found


(Til I found)


The truth


(The truth)


And I owe it all to (you)


Oh woah-oh-oh-woah


Now I've


(I've)


Had


The time of my life
