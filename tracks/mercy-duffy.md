Hit the beat and take it to the bass now

I love you
But I gotta stay true
My morals got me on my knees
I'm beggin' please
Stop playin' games

I don't know what this is
But you got me good
Just like you knew you would

I don't know what you do
But you do it well
I'm under your spell.

You got me beggin' you for mercy
Why won't you release me
You got me beggin' you for mercy
Why won't you release me
I said release me

Now you think that I
Will be somethin' on the side
But you got to understand
That I need a man
Who can take my hand
Yes I do

I don't know what this is
But you got me good
Just like you knew you would

I don't know what you do
But you do it well
I'm under your spell

You got me beggin' you for mercy
Why won't you release me
You got me beggin' you for mercy
Why won't you release me
I said you better release me


You look at me and think we're the same kind
'Cause you don't know what I've got in my mind
I want a bit more than I'm asking for
But I just don't want to waste my time
You think that I'll be the other girl
Just like there's nothing in this world
I wanna have fun, go get me some
I just don't know where you're coming from

I'm beggin' you for mercy
Just why won't you release me
I'm beggin' you for mercy
You got me beggin', you got me beggin', you got me beggin'

Mercy
Why won't you release me
I'm beggin' you for mercy
Why won't you release me

You got me beggin' you for mercy
I'm beggin' you for mercy
I'm beggin' you for mercy
I'm beggin' you for mercy
I'm beggin' you for mercy
Why won't you release me

Break it down

Mercy
Begging you for mercy
You got me begging down on my knees
I said, you got me begging
Begging you for mercy
You got me begging
Begging you for mercy
