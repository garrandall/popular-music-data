Yesterday, I met a boy so fine
Right away I knew
He'd captivate my mind

So strong
The kind you dream about
Baby, together
We could really turn it out

I showed him to
Some friends of mine
They said, girl
Don't waste your time

That boy's no good for you
Listen, girl
I'm telling you
I think it's time you knew that


All that glitters isn't gold
Everything you see isn't what it seems to be
(No, oh, oh)
Oh, no
All that glitters isn't gold


Sometimes we make the mistake
Of thinking everything
That looks good is great

We all seem to go for what shines
And then we leave all of
The other things behind

Some people always give a show
Cause it's the only way they know
But you don't have to play that game
Because the only thing that matters
Is what's inside your heart




So here's my advice to you
Everything you see's
Not always true

Take the time to look inside
And find out for yourself
What's really on their minds



No, oh, oh, oh, it isn't gold
No, oh, oh, oh, it isn't gold
No, oh, oh, oh, it isn't gold...

Oh, no, it isn't gold
No, no, it isn't gold
Everything you see's
Not what it seems to be

Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no
All that glitters isn't gold
No, no, no



All that glitters isn't gold
(No, oh, oh)
No, no
All that glitters isn't gold

No, oh, oh, oh, it isn't gold
No, oh, oh, oh, it isn't gold
No, oh, oh, oh, it isn't gold
