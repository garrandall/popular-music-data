Hello mothafucka, hey hi how ya durrn'?
It's Weezy F Baby come to take a shit and urine
On the toilet bowl bitches, pussy ass niggas
Stomping on this beat like a motherfucking sigma
Bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle
I'm so official all I need is a whistle
Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol
She opened up her mouth and then I blew her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
Riders rolling with me, like 11 wheels
Find out where you living, kill you in the kitchen
The feds trying to clip us but we ain't even tripping

I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard

I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard

First off
You know what it is if you heard Drake
Making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
Never see me out
Cause I live in my workplace
I'll give you the business
So button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed
You would think I planned it
I'm just doing me and you could never understand it
Chicks get hammered
Big dick bandit
Money flowing like a slit wrist no bandage
Blowing purple clouds nigga I'm so sky high
I ain't cutting anybody slices outta my pie
Outta this world though: I'm so sci-fi
And I don't sit still I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth so I'm cool in every hood spot
21 years and I ain't ever met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doing hook shots
Cover me I'm goin' in and bucking when the hook drop

I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard

I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard

Hold up, wait one motherfucking minute
It's the El Capitan
I got motherfucking lieutenants
If I said "I'm goin' in" then I motherfucking meant it
And if I brought it in the club
Then I'mma motherfucking spend it
Cost a few hundred bands
And I'm motherfucking in it
No need for a room
Yea you know I'm fucking in it
She acting like she not, but she know she fucking winning
She said, "I seen it all"
I said, "no you fucking didn't"
You ever bust 10 nuts in a 2-seater?
She said "I can't feel my legs"
I'm like "bitch, me neither"
I'm goin' in
Where should I begin?
I don't even know, maybe where my blunt end
And I'mma be a legend even when my life end
And I'mma be a legend even when this life end
Yea I do my thang, hop up out it like BEM!
Bitch, I said I'm him, so I'm nothing like them
I'm goin' in!

I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard

Bitch,
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
