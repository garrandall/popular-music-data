How can I be sure in a world
That's constantly changing?
How can I be sure where
I stand with you?

Whenever I, whenever I am away from you
I wanna die 'cause you know I wanna stay with you
How do I know?
Maybe you're trying to use me
Flying too high can confuse me
Touch me but don't take me down

Whenever I, whenever I am away from you
My alibi is telling people I don't care for you
Maybe I'm just hanging around
With my head up upside down
It's a pity, I can't seem to find someone
Who's as good to me, baby
It's you

How can I be sure?
I really, really, really wanna know
I really, really, really gotta know. Oh

How's the weather
Whether or not
We're together
Together we'll see
In much better 
I love you, I love you forever
You know where I can be found

How can I be sure in a world
That's constantly changing?
How can I be sure? I'm sure with you
