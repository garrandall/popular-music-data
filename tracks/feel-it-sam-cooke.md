Feel it, feel it

Baby when the band is playing and that solid beat
O, make you wanna move, make you wanna groove
Make you wanna pat your feet
Don't fight it, don't fight, feel it

No, now when we dance close together
With your cheeck close to mine
And you begin to feel, a funny little thrill
Moving up your spine
Don't fight it, don't fight, feel it

Baby, when the swinging music, makes you wanna flip
Don't be in pain, trying to restrain
Go ahead and move your hips

Baby when you're dancing near me
And I feel I wanna tease
And when I do, the feeling gets you
When you feel you wanna squeeze
Don't fight it, don't fight, feel it
Feel it (many times)

Baby, when the swinging music, makes you wanna flip
Don't be in pain, trying to restrain
Go ahead and move your hips
Baby when you're dancing near me
And I feel I wanna tease
And when I do, the feeling gets you
When you feel you wanna squeeze
Don't fight it, don't fight, feel it
