I'm not man or machine 
I'm just something in between
Whoa, oh, whoa, whoa 
I'm all love, a dynamo 
So push the button and let me go
Whoa, oh, whoa, whoa

You want me to come alive 
Flick the switch into overdrive 
You and me can let it be 
Ready (ready), aim (aim), fire 

Touch that dial
Turn me on 
Start me like a motor
Make me run 
Lovin' every minute of it 
Lovin' every minute of it 

Turn that dial all the way 
Shoot me like a rocket into space 
Lovin' every minute of it 
Lovin' every minute of it 
Lovin' every minute of it, c'mon

I got fun, you want some 
I'm ever ready, Dr. Love
Whoa, oh, whoa, whoa
I'm antenna, aerial
I'm tunin' in, I'm outta control
Whoa, oh, whoa, whoa

You got love, you got a deal
You wanna drive then take the wheel 
You and me can let it be 
Ready (ready), aim (aim), fire

Touch that dial
Turn me on 
Start me like a motor
Make me run 
Lovin' every minute of it 
Lovin' every minute of it 

Turn that dial all the way 
Shoot me like a rocket into space 
Lovin' every minute of it 
Lovin' every minute of it 
Lovin' every minute of it, all right

Oh, you want me to come alive 
So flick the switch into overdrive 
You and me can let it be 
Ready (ready), aim (aim), fire 

Touch that dial
Turn me on 
Start me like a motor
Make me run 
(Lovin')
Lovin' every minute of it 
Lovin' every minute of it 

Turn that dial all the way 
Shoot me like a rocket into space 
Lovin' every minute of it 
Lovin' every minute of it 
Lovin' every minute of it 
Lovin' every minute of it 

C'mon and touch that dial
Turn me on 
Start me like a motor
Make me run 
Turn that dial all the way 
Shoot me like a rocket into space 
Lovin' every minute of it 
Lovin' every minute of it 
Whoa, oh, whoa, whoa
