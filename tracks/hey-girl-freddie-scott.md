You took my son away from me
You know how hard it was for me to get him this damn school and graduate?
You know how many black men graduate?
Not many
Because you bring them down to this type of level where they feel like, "I don't got nothing to live for, anyway"
"They gon' try to take me out, anyway"
Rest in peace
To all those we lost
By murder of the police
Damn

Don't shoot me, my nigga, it's just a book
It's probably what keeps everyone's life end up getting took
Wanna put that iron on us because of the way we look
My mama call me every time there's a shooting because she shook, this shit real
Just watch the news, in my city, we goin' crazy
Ain't nobody backin' down, we wildin' like it's the 80's
Why y'all hate the police?
I hate them 'cause they hate me
Why y'all burnin' cop cars?
Why'd the judge put me on probation?
So it y'all don't make no sense to us and we don't make no sense to you
Let's all start using common sense and see what common sense'll do
They went and got the army?
We got ourselves a couple missiles, too
But I'ma use my words, 'cause I'm somebody they gon' listen to
DaBaby, I'm proud of this Charlotte, this city made me
Let one more cop get away and it's gon' get crazy
You probably watchin' CNN, don't listen to it
And you probably shouldn't speak on this shit if you ain't been through it, for real
R.I.P

Today, the FBI entered the case of an officer in Ferguson, Missouri who shot an unarmed black man to death over the weekend (Baby)
That sparked rioting
Fires were set (You're supposed to protect and serve us)
I watched the police chase after the guy full force
He was unarmed, he ran for his life, they shot him and he fell
He put his arms up to let them know he was compliant and he was unarmed, and they shot him twice in the arm, and he fell to the grounnd (You're supposed to protect and serve us)

And, "Murder," was all she wrote
Yeah, and dying was not a choice
Another life lost of murder
Hey, they supposed to protect and serve us
I'm just tryna live right
They just tryna take my life
Another soul lost of murder
They supposed to protect and serve us (They is)
They supposed to protect and serve us
They supposed to protect and serve us
They supposed to protect and serve us
Hey, they supposed to protect and serve us

They shot my daddy
I'm say this one more, I'm tired
My daddy was over there reading a motherfucking book in the car
No, they tased him first, then they shot him four motherfucking times in the chest (Look)

I ain't waitin' for the perfect moment, took the moment and made it perfect
Don't do it for the money, but I know I deserve it
For the people that feel saved by the Zimmerman verdict
Rest in peace Jonathan Ferrell, 'cause you was murdered
By the same people that's supposed to protect and serve us
Now what I'm supposed to tell my kids when they heard it
Uh, crazy world, swear it's a crazy world
As I put this prosthetic leg on my little girl
Lookin' at I, so pure
All of this pain we must endure
They killin' our youth for they 
Can't even send my son to the store if it's secure
I'm so tired of bendin' my hand today
Grab on my pistol and just go blast the way
I might seem ignorant, but I have to say
I don't know if I'ma die because I'm black today

And, "Murder," was all she wrote
Yeah, and dying was not a choice
Another life lost of murder
Hey, they supposed to protect and serve us
I'm just tryna live right
They just tryna take my life
Another soul lost of murder
They supposed to protect and serve us (They is)
They supposed to protect and serve us
They supposed to protect and serve us
They supposed to protect and serve us
Hey, they supposed to protect and serve us

Yeah
Rest in peace
Keith Lamont Scott
Alton Sterling
Philando Castille
Tamir Rice
Freddie Gray
Sandra Bland
John Crawford
And all the other victims
Gunned down by the police
Innocent or not innocent
You ain't have to kill 'em
They supposed to protect and serve us (But they don't)
Hey, they supposed to protect and serve us (But they don't)
They supposed to protect and serve us (But they don't)
Hey, they supposed to protect and serve us (But they don't)
Hey, they supposed to protect and serve us (But they don't)
They supposed to protect and serve us (But they don't)
Hey, they supposed to protect and serve us (But they don't)
