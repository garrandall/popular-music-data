You say you gotta go and find yourself
You say that you're becoming someone else
Don't recognize the face in the mirror looking back at you
You say you're leaving as you look away
I know there's really nothing left to say
Just know I'm here whenever you need me
I'll wait for you


So I'll let you go, I'll set you free
And when you've seen what you need to see
When you find you, come back to me


Take your time, I won't go anywhere
Picture you with the wind in your hair
I'll keep your things right where you left them
I'll be here for you


Oh and I'll let you go, I'll set you free
And when you've seen what you need to see
When you find you, come back to me
And I hope you find everything that you need
I'll be right here waiting to see
You find you, come back to me


I can't get close if you're not there
I can't get inside if there's no soul there
I can't fix you, I can't save you
It's something you'll have to do


So I'll let you go, I'll set you free
And when you've seen what you need to see
When you find you, come back to me
Come back to me


So I'll let you go, I'll set you free
And when you've seen what you need to see
When you find you, come back to me
And I hope you find everything that you need
I'll be right here waiting to see
When you find you, come back to me


Ah, oo
Ah, oo
When you find you, come back to me
Ah, oo
Ah, oo
When you find you, come back to me
When you find you, come back to me
