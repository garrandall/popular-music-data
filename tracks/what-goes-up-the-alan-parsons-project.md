What goes up, must come down
What must rise, must fall
And what goes on in your life
Is writing on the wall

If all things must fall
Why build a miracle at all?
If all things must pass
Even a miracle won't last

What goes up, must come down
What must stand alone?
And what goes on, in your mind
Is turning into stone

If all things must fall
Why build a miracle at all?
If all things must pass
Even a pyramid won't last

How can you be so sure?
How do you know what the earth will endure?
How can you be so sure
That the wonders you've made in you life
Will be seen by the millions
Who'll follow to visit the site of your dream?

What goes up, must come down
What goes round, must come round
What's been lost, must be found
