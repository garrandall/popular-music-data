Your lips, your smile, your tenderness, oh baby
The way you walk, I can't resist your style
When I sleep at night, I dream of you, oh baby
I wake up wet, thinking of you, oh baby
How can a man like me
Convince a girl like you
To be his lover and one and only
How can I make you see
That I'm the one for you
And nobody does it like me


Hey pretty girl
Can I be your man tonight, baby?
Hey pretty mama
Can I sleep with you tonight?
Hey, pretty girl when you come to my room tonight
I'll make you come through the night

Your legs around my waist so tight
I'll slide down south to taste you right
You taste so good to me
How does a man like me
Seduce a girl like you
How can I make you my one and only
How can I make you scream
There's no one else for you
'And nobody does it like me, baby


Hey pretty girl
Can I be your man tonight, baby?
Hey pretty mama
Can I sleep with you tonight?
Hey, pretty girl when you come to my room tonight
I'll make you come through the night


There's a candle that's burning in my heart tonight
And the flame is full of my desire
And I can't help but desire you in my bed tonight
And I'll touch you in the places
Where no one's been before
And I'll kiss you in the places
Where men sometimes ignore
And I'll take you to a level
You've never felt before
And though you won't understand it
You'll cry and ask for more


Hey pretty girl
Can I be your man tonight, baby?
Hey pretty mama
Can I sleep with you tonight?
Hey, pretty girl when you come to my room tonight
I'll make you come through the night
