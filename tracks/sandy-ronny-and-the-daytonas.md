Hey, girl, with sunlight in your hair (wo-o-o-oh)
It hurts me so to see you standing there (wo-o-o-oh)
O-O-Oh Sandy, you laugh and run away
You just don't care

Your kiss was warmer than the sun (wo-o-o-oh)
And I can't forget all the things we've done (wo-o-o-oh)
O-0-Oh Sandy, do you remember when
I was the one?

You've been around since
That new boy who found you
Took you uptown
So far from me

But someday, you're good times will be through (wo-o-o-oh)
And I know just what you're gonna do (wo-o-o-oh):
You'll come back, Sandy; you know I'll still be here
Waiting for you

(Spoken:)
Sandy. Sandy. I love you
