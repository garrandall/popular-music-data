It's just like me
To say to you
Love me do
And I'll be true
And what I'd like
For you to say
Is you'll come home
To me each day

Ah, you'll be my girl
That's what I want
Just you sweet girl
And not a front
It's just like me
To feel so good
And fall so much
In love with you

It's just like me
It's just like me
I'm actin' the fool
That's how I'll be
But it's just like you
To say goodbye
And leave me all
Alone at night, waah!

It's just like me
