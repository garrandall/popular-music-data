Oh, boy
Oh, yeah yeah
Oh yeah

You walked in on the sly
Scopin' for love
In the crowd I caught your eye
You can't hide your stuff

(You came to catch)
You thought I'd be naive and tame
(You met your match)
But I beat you at your own game, oh

(Who's zoomin' who?)
Take another look and tell me, baby
(Who's zoomin who?)
Who's zoomin' who?
(Who's zoomin who?)
Now the fish jumped off the hook, didn't I, baby?
(Who's zoomin who?)
Yeah

(Who's zoomin' who?)
Take another look and tell me, baby
(Who's zoomin who?)
Who's zoomin' who?
(Who's zoomin who?)
The fish jumped off the hook, baby
(Who's zoomin who?)
Yeah, yeah

Guess you believed the world
Played by your rules
Here stands an experienced girl
I ain't nobody's fool, bump you

(Don't speculate)
You thought you had me covered now, boy
(I've got your bait)
But you're bound to be my lover, oh

(Who's zoomin' who?)
Take another look and tell me, baby
(Who's zoomin who?)
Who's zoomin' who?
(Who's zoomin who?)
Now the fish jumped off the hook, didn't I, baby?
(Who's zoomin who?)
Yeah, yeah, oh

(Who's zoomin' who?)
Take another look and tell me, baby
(Who's zoomin who?)
Who's zoomin' who?
(Who's zoomin who?)
Now the fish jumped off the hook, didn't I, baby?
(Who's zoomin who?)
Hoo

You think you're smooth
And you can pick and choose when the time is right
But just look behind, you'll be surprised to find
I'm gonna make you mine tonight, oh yeah

(Who's zoomin' who?)
Take another look and tell me, baby
(Who's zoomin who?)
Now the fish jumped off the hook, didn't I, boy?
(Who's zoomin who?)
Take another look and tell me, baby
(Who's zoomin who?)
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, oh yeah

(Who's zoomin' who?)
Take another look and tell me, baby
(Who's zoomin who?)
Who's zoomin' who?
(Who's zoomin who?)
Take another look and tell me, baby
(Who's zoomin who?)
Yeah

(Who's zoomin' who?)
Fish in the sea within me
(Who's zoomin' who?)
Sure, you're alright, yeah yeah
(Who's zoomin' who?)
Take another look, tell me, boy
(Who's zoomin' who?)
Oh oh

(Who's zoomin' who?)
You'll remember my name
(Who's zoomin' who?)
I'm the one who beat you at your own game

(Who's zoomin' who?)
Take another look and tell me, sweet thing
(Who's zoomin' who?)
Who's zoomin', who's foolin'
Who's zoomin', who's foolin'
(Who's zoomin' who?)
Oh, oh boy
(Who's zoomin' who?)
