Baby, can you hear me?
Girl, you rock my soul
Give me full control
You made my life so happy, now
When you came through the door
But don't come running back with tears in your eyes
I won't be the one to listen to your story
Don't come running back, oh baby
Don't come running back, oh girl
You are my soul and inspiration
My only consolation
But, babe, you hurt my pride - yes you did, now
When you walked through the door, oh
But don't come running back with tears in your eyes
I won't be the one, I can't listen to your pleading no more, now
So don't come running back, oh baby (Don't run back)
Don't come running back, oh girl (No no no no no)
Don't come running back, oh baby (Don't run back)
Don't come running, don't come running
Don't come running back, oh girl
Hey
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Girl, you rock my - baby, now, you rock my soul
Yeah, you do - give me full control
You made my life so happy, now, oh
When you walked through the door
So don't come running back with tears in your eyes
I won't be the one to listen to your story, now
Don't come running back, oh baby (Don't run back)
Don't come running back, oh girl
Don't come running back, oh baby (Don't run back)
Don't come running, don't come, don't come running back
No, girl
(Don't come running back, oh baby - don't run back)
Hey, I'm tired of your crying
(Don't come running back, oh girl)
Go out on me at night
You're cheating, and you're lying
(Don't come running back, oh baby - don't run back)
I can't take it, girl, no-no-no-no-no-no-no
(Don't come running back, oh girl)
Don't come running back, no baby
