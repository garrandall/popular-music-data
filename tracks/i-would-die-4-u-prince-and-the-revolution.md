Last night, I spent another lonely Christmas
Darling, darling, you should've been there
Cause all the ones I dream about
You are the one that makes my love shout
You see, you are the only one I care for

Remember the time we swam naked in your father's pool?
Boy, he was upset that night but boy, was that ever cool
Remember the night we played pokeno for money
And you robbed me blind
Remember how you used to scream so loud
'Cause you hated the number nine

Hey, I saw your sister skating on the lake this afternoon
Good Heaven, how she's grown
She swooned the boy skaters, she is so tall
But of all your father's children
All your father's children, baby
You know, you are the finest of them all
You are brighter than the northern star

Last night, I spent another lonely Christmas
Darling, darling, you should've been there
Cause all the ones I dream about
You are the one that makes my love shout
You see, you are the only one I care for

My mama used to say, "Always trust your lover."
Now I guess that only applies to her
Cause baby you promised me
Baby you promised me you'd never leave
Then you died on the 25th day of December, oh baby

Last night, oh, I spent another lonely, lonely Christmas
Darling, baby, you should've been there
Cause all the ones I dream about
You are the one that makes my love shout
You see, you are the only one I care for, yeah

Your father said it was pneumonia
Your mother said it was strep
But the doctor said you were dead and I
I say its senseless
Every Christmas night for seven years now
I drink banana daiquiris till I'm blind
As long as I can hear you smilin' baby
You won't hear my tears, another lonely Christmas is mine
Yeah, mine, yeah
Another lonely Christmas is mine

Last night, yeah, I spent another lonely, lonely Christmas
Darling, darling, you should've been there
Cause all the ones I dream about
You are the one that makes my love shout
You see, you are the only one I care for, yeah

Another lonely
