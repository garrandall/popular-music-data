Operator
Oh, could you help me place this call?
You see the number on the matchbook
Is old and faded

She's livin' in L. A
With my best old ex-friend Ray
A guy she said she knew well
And sometimes hated

Isn't that the way they say it goes?
But let's forget all that
And give me the number if you can find it
So I can call just to tell 'em
I'm fine and to show I've overcome the blow
I've learned to take it well
I only wish my words could just convince myself
That it just wasn't real
But that's not the way it feels

Operator
Oh. Could you help me place this call?
'Cause I can't read the number
That you just gave me

There's something in my eyes
You know it happens every time
I think about the love
That I thought would save me

Isn't that the way they say it goes?
But let's forget all that
And give me the number if you can find it
So I can call just to tell 'em
I'm fine and to show I've overcome the blow
I've learned to take it well
I only wish my words could just convince myself
That it just wasn't real
But that's not the way it feels

No, no, no, no
That's not the way it feels

Operator
Oh, let's forget about this call
There's no one there I really wanted to talk to
Thank you for your time
Oh, you've been so much more than kind
You can keep the dime

Isn't that the way they say it goes?
But let's forget all that
And give me the number if you can find it
So I can call just to tell 'em
I'm fine and to show I've overcome the blow
I've learned to take it well
I only wish my words could just convince myself
That it just wasn't real
But that's not the way it feels
