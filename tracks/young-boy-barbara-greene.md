Too young to fall in love
My baby, ooh
Too young to fall in love
My baby, ooh

Too young to fall in love
Too young to know her well
Wants to give her heart

Oh, you're such a young boy
Young boy

Too young to realize
There's love for you in my eyes
And I want for only your love
Oh, oh, young boy

(Young boy, young boy)

You're so wrapped up in your schoolbooks
And you won't give me a look
I hope you don't wait too late
And let somebody take me away

Too young to fall in love
My baby, ooh

My can't take it any longer
'Cause my love is steady getting stronger
And I want for only your love
Oh, oh, young boy (young boy)

Young boy (young boy)
(Too young to fall in love)
Why did you have to be so young
