 Put on your yarmulke, it's time for Chanukah...

 Sounds good, guys!

 Give it up for the Drei-Dels, everybody!

 Once again, it's Chanukah. The miracle of Chanukah!

Chanukah is
the festival of lights.
One day of presents? 
Hell no, we get the eight crazy nights! (Oh, boy)
But if you still feel like the only kid in town
without a Christmas tree, 
I guess my first two songs didn't do it for ya,
so here comes number three!

Ross and Phoebe from Friends
say the Chanukah blessing,
So does Lenny's pal Squiggy and Will and Grace's Debra Messing!
Melissa Gilbert and Michael Landon never mixed meat with dairy,
Maybe they shoulda called that show 
Little Kosher House on the Prairie!
We got Jerry Lewis,
Ben Stiller, and Jack Black,
Tom Arnold converted to Judaism, 
but you guys can have him back!

(Just kiddin' Tommy!)

We may not get to kiss 
underneath the mistletoe,
But we can do it all night long 
with Deuce Bigalow!

 I'm Jewish!

 Oh, my God. Sweet Robbie Schneider is here!

 Put on your yarmulke, here comes Chanukah...

 The guy in Willie Nelson's band who plays harmonica celebrates Chanukaaah!

 Ah, good job, Schneider!

 What are you talkin' about?!?

 All right, now.

Osama bin Laden...

 BOO!

Not a big fan of the Jews!
Well maybe that's because he lost a figure skating match 
to gold medalist Sarah Hughes!

(Her mama's Jewish.)

Houdini and David Blaine escape straightjackets 
with such precision, 
but one thing they could not get out of...
Their painful circumcision!

Gwyneth Paltrow's half-Jewish,
But a full-time Oscar winner,
Jennifer Connelly's half-Jewish too,
And I'd like to put some more in her! Whoo!
There's Lou Reed, Perry Farrell, 
Beck, and Paula Abdul,
Joey Ramone invented punk rock music, 
but first came Hebrew school!
Hey!

Natalie Portmanika
It's time to celebrate Chanukah,
I hope I get an Abtronica
On this joyful, toyful Chanukah,
So get a high colonika
And soil your long-johnnakahs
If you really, really wannakah,
Have a happy, happy, happy, happy,
happy, happy, happy, happy Chanukah!

Buckle up for safety, everybody!
