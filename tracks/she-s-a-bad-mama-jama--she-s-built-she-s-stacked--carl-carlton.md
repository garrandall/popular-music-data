She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be
She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be


Her body measurements are perfect in every dimension
She's got a figure
That's sure enough paying attention
She's poetry in motion
A beautiful sight to see
I get so excited viewing her anatomy


She's built, oh, she's stacked
Got all the curves that men like
She's built, oh, she's stacked
Got all the curves that men like


She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be
She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be


Looks like she's poured into the gold
She's bad
The essence of beauty
Oh, such lovely hair
She's foxy, classy
Oh, sexy, sassy
She's heavenly
A treat for the eye to see


She's built, oh, she's stacked
Got all the curves that men like
She's built, oh, she's stacked
Got all the curves that men like


She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be
She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be


Whoo, whoo!
La la la la
La la la la la la
La la
Whoo, whoo!
La la la la
La la la la la la
La la
Whoo, whoo!



She's built, she's stacked
Got all the curves that men like


Her body measurements are perfect in every dimension
She's got a figure
That's sure enough paying attention
She's poetry in motion
A beautiful sight to see
I get so excited viewing her anatomy


She's built, oh, she's stacked
Got all the curves that men like
She's built, oh, she's stacked
Got all the curves that men like


She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be
She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be
