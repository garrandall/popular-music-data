Oh, oh, I love you
Oh, oh, I love you

I'll follow a rainbow
Bring you a pot of gold
Give my coat if you are cold
Why, because I love you

I'll even work a paper route
Buy you things and take you out
Sing how I feel
Why, because I love you

I love you
Put none above you
I need you

Say, little girl
I want to give you
Said now, baby (baby)

Don't you know I love you
(I love you)
I said I love you

Oh, oh, I love you
Oh, oh, I love you

I'll take the sunlight
So we'll have a moon at night
Protect you like a Roman knight
Why, because I love you

I'll hire a big band
Just so we can dance
All night long
I'll hold your hand
Why, because I love you

I love you
Put none above you
Said I need you
I want to please you

Baby (baby)
Baby (baby)
Don't you know I said
Baby (baby)

Don't you know I love you
I said I love you

Oh, oh, I love you
Oh, oh, I love you

La la la la
I said I love you
La la la la
Don't you know I love you

Oh, oh, I love you
Oh, oh, I love you
