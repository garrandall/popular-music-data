I come home, in the mornin' light
My mother says "When you gonna live your life right?"
Oh, mother dear, we're not the fortunate ones
And those girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have fun
The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells "What you gonna do with your life?"
Oh daddy dear, you know you're still number one
But girls, they wanna have fun
Yeah, those girls, they wanna have
That's all they really want
Is some fun
When the workin' day is done
Those girls, they wanna have fun
Yeah, those girls, they wanna have fun
Some boys take a beautiful girl
And they hide her away from the rest of the world
I wanna be the one to walk in the sun
But girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, those girls, they wanna have
That's all they really want
Is some fun
When the workin' day is done
Those girls, they wanna have fun
Yeah, those girls, they wanna have funA
