I play the road, 
And the highway is our song, 
And every city's like the same three chords 
Been helping us along when the story's told 
And the crowd has come and gone 
Shaking off the miles and trying to make it home 

Every exit is a season, 
Every signal is a beacon 
And the wind, it carries me 
And it eases up my load 
Everyday I drag the turns 
Every candle still burns 
And every lesson I have learned 
Brings us closer to the crowd 

I play the road, 
And the highway is our song, 
And every city's like the same three chords 
Been helping us along when the story's told 
And the crowd is done and gone 
Shaking off the miles and trying to make it home 

Well the bus it is our steeple, 
It brings us to the people 
And they will be there waiting, 
Dancing young and old 
And every one of us gets tired, 
But every one remains inspired 
And every one of us require 

To keep picking through our souls 

I play the road, 
And the highway is our song, 
And every city's like the same three chords 
Been helping us along when the story's told 
And the crowd is done and gone 
Shaking off the miles and trying to make it home 

She says, "Daddy where do you go 
When you leave me all these nights 
With a suitcase and guitar in your hand? 
Kissing me and mom goodbye with a tear and a smile, 
Where do you go, 
Daddy where do you go?" 

I play the road, 
And this highway is our song, 
And every city's like the same three chords 
Been helping us along when the story's told 
And the crowd is done and gone 
Shaking off the miles and trying to make it home 
Shaking off the miles 
(Shaking off the miles) 
(Mile after mile) 
Mile after mile 
Baby, I'm coming home
