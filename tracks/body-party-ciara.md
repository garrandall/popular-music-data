Ohh, oooh
Ohh, ohhh
Yeah, right there
No, right there
I was having fun
I hope you're having fun too
I said it


My body is your party, baby
Nobody's invited but you, baby
I can do it slow now tell me what you want
Baby, put your phone down, you should turn it off
'Cause tonight it's going down, tell your boys it's going down
We in the zone now, don't stop
Ooooh, oooh


You can't keep your hands off me
Touch me right there, rock my body
I can't keep my hands off you
Your body is my party
I'm doing this little dance for you
You got me so excited
Now it's just me and you
Your body's my party, let's get it started, ohh
Boy, you should know that
Your love is always on my mind
I'm not gonna fight it
I want it all the time
Boy, you should know that
Your love is always on my mind
And I can't deny it
I want you, I'm on you


I can't lie, I won't lie, it's amazing
My faces go places, you're taking me
Baby, take your time now, there's no need to rush
We can go another round if that's what you want
'Cause tonight it's going down
Yeah, you know it's going down
We in the zone now, don't stop
Oooh, ohh


You can't keep your hands off me
Touch me right there, rock my body
I can't keep my hands off you
Your body is my party
I'm doing this little dance for you
You got me so excited
Now it's just me and you
Your body's my party, let's get it started, ohh
Boy, you should know that
Your love is always on my mind
I'm not gonna fight it
I want it all the time
Boy, you should know that
Your love is always on my mind
And I can't deny it
I want you, I'm on you


The things I wanna do to you
My body's calling you
I'm having so much fun with you
Now it's just me and you
Your body's my party, let's get it started
Ohhh
