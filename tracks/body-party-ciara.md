This is the remix
Gentlemenâs remix
You ready?
Yeah
Where do you want me to start?
Right there


Did you receive my invitation
You did I see that you R.S.V.P. no hesitation
Three letters on the bottom
B.Y.B.: bring ya body
Nothing more and nothing less
Dress code is strictly enforced
But feel free to come under dressed
Ooh girl slow it down a bit
Movinâ that thang like that girl
You gon' end this party quick
Have me apologizing and shit
Talkinâ bout my bad
Give me ten minutes
Round two will be greater
While we are waiting come here baby,
Let me taste your party favors
When I put my mouth on you
Kiss you right there, rock that body
Treat you like good cooked food
Girl your body is my dinner party
I know you like it too
Your legs wonât stop shakinâ
Girl youâre invited to my dinner party
Your bodyâs the entrÃ©e, ooh
Girl you should know that
Your love is my favorite dish
You wanted your mind blown, just lay back
And let me grant your wish
Girl you should know that your love
Is my favorite dish
You wanted your mind blown I love it
Hold on, you like that baby?


I canât lie, I wonât lie, itâs amazing
My faces go places, youâre taking me
Baby take your time now, thereâs no need to rush
We can go another round if thatâs what you want
Cause tonight itâs going down
Yeah, you know itâs going down
We in the zone now, donât stop
Oh oh

You can't keep your hands off me
Touch me right there, rock my body
I canât keep my hands off you
Your body is my party
Iâm doing this little dance for you
You got me so excited
Now itâs just me and you
Your bodyâs my party, letâs get it started, oh
Boy you should know that
Your love is always on my mind
Iâm not gonna fight it
I want it all the time
Boy you should know that
Your love is always on my mind
And I canât deny it
I want you, Iâm on you

The things I wanna do to you
My bodyâs calling you
Iâm having so much fun with you
Now itâs just me and you
Your bodyâs my party,
Letâs get it started, ooh
