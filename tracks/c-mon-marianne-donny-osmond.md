Oh here I am (here I am)
On my knees again (knees again)
I'll do anything (anything)
Just to make it right (make it right)
Say you understand (understand)
Oh I know you can (know you can)
C'mon Marianne, uh-hm

Don't matter what the people say (people say)
It didn't happen that way (happen that way)
She was a passing fling (passing fling)
Not a permanent thing (permanent thing)
Say you understand (understand)
Oh I know you can (know you can)

C'mon Marianne (Marianne)
C'mon Marianne (Marianne)
C'mon Marianne (Marianne)
Say you can understand
My Marianne, Marianne, Marianne, Marianne

Well your big brown eyes (big brown eyes)
Are all full of tears (full of tears)
From the bitterness (bitterness)
Of those lonely years (lonely years)
So I hang my head (hang my head)
Wish that I were dead (I were dead)

C'mon Marianne (Marianne)
C'mon Marianne (Marianne)
C'mon Marianne (Marianne)
Say you can understand
My Marianne (Marianne)
C'mon Marianne (Marianne)
C'mon Marianne (Marianne), oh

Marianne, Marianne, Marianne, oh Marianne

(Repeat and fade)
