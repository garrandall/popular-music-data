Bells will be ringing
The glad, glad news
Oh, what a Christmas
To end the blues
My baby's gone
I have no friends
To wish me greetings
Ooh, once again

Choirs
Will be singing
Silent Night
Christmas carols
By candlelight
Please come home
For Christmas
Please come home
For Christmas
If not for Christmas
By New Year's night

Friends and relations
Send salutations
Sure as the stars
Shine above
This is Christmas
Yeah, Christmas my dear
The time of year
To be with the one
You love

So won't you tell me
You'll never more roam
Christmas and New Years
Will find you home
Please come home
For Christmas
Please come home
For Christmas
If not for Christmas
By New Year's night

There'll be
No more sorrow
No grief and pain
And I'll be happy
Happy once again
