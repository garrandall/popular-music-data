Bells will be ringing the glad, glad news
Oh, what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone, I have no friends
To wish me greetings, mm once again


Choirs will be singing "Silent Night"
Christmas carols by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas, by New Year's night


Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
This is Christmas, yes, Christmas, my dear
The time of year to be with the one you love


Then won't you tell me, you'll never more roam
Christmas and New Year's will find you home
There'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
'Cause I'll be happy, happy, once again


Oh, no more sorrow, no grief and pain
'Cause I'll be happy, Christmas, once again
