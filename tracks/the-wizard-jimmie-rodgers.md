One day I met a wizard, many years ago.
He was very, very old. He was very very wise.
He told me a secret, many years ago:
How to live, how to love, how to win the golden prize.

Tell 'em what the wizard says. Tell 'em what the wizard says.
All you have to do is snap your fingers.
Make a wish and snap your fingers.
That's what you have to do.
And your wishes will all come true.

One day I met a maiden with honey-colored hair.
There never was a maiden so beautiful somewhere.
The first time that I kissed her, I promised her my life.
And I wondered how to win her to win her for my wife.

Remember what the wizard said. Remember what the wizard said.
All you have to do is snap your fingers.
Make a wish and snap your fingers.
That's what you have to do.
And your wishes will all come true.

The day that we were married, I remember it so well.
I remember how I kissed her as the orange blossom fell.
I remember how I whispered as I held her tenderly.
Now that we are married we must raise a family.

Remember what the wizard said. Remember what the wizard said.
All you have to do is snap your fingers.
Make a wish and snap your fingers.
That's what you have to do.
And your wishes will all come true.

Today we're all together, a family of four.
The girl and boy I wished for are playing on the floor.
And one day when they're older, I'll hold 'em on my knee.
And I'll them the secret that the wizard told to me.

Tell 'em what the wizard said. Tell 'em what the wizard said.
All you have to do is snap your fingers.
Make a wish and snap your fingers.
That's what you have to do.
And your wishes... will all come true.
