Sugar babe, Sugar baby
Please say you'll be mine
Sugar babe, Sugar baby
Please say that you'll be mine

Every time I see you
Cold chills run down my spine

Sugar babe, Sugar baby
Really knocks me off my feet
Sugar babe, Sugar baby
Really knocks me off my feet

I love the way you twist when
You're strolling down the street

Well, Sugar baby
Please show me a sign
Sugar baby, come on
Show me a sign

Come on, Sugar baby
Place your lips to mine
Yeah

Oh, Sugar baby
Come on, show me a sign
Oh, Sugar baby
Come on, show me a sign

Come on, Sugar baby
And place your lips to mine
Yeah
