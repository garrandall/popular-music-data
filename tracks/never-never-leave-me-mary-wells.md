I love you more than anyone
Should ever be allowed
To love anyone or anything
(Anyone or anything)

And I need you more than anyone
Should ever be allowed
To need anyone or anything
(Anyone or anything)

So darling, please don't ever break my heart
I beg you, please don't ever make us part
'Cause without you I'd be a little lost sheep
And I'd die

Never, never leave me
Never, never leave me
Never, never leave me
Never, never leave me

I would cry more than anyone
Should ever be allowed
To cry over anyone or anything
(Anyone or anything)

So please love me more than anyone
Should ever be allowed
To love anyone or anything
(Anyone or anything)

Oh darling, on my knees I'm begging you
I'm pleading, please love me as I love you
'Cause without you I'd be a little lost sheep
And I'd die

Never, never leave me
Never, never leave me
Never, never leave me
Never, never leave me
Don't ever make me weep

Oh darling, on my knees I'm begging you
I'm pleading, please love me as I love you
'Cause without you I'd be a little lost sheep
And I'd die

Never, never leave me
Never, never leave me
Never, never leave me
...
