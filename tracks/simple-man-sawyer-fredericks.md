Mama told me when I was young
"Come sit beside me, my only son
Won't you listen to what I say
And if you do this it'll help you some day"

"Oh, take it slowly, don't live too fast
Cause troubles will come and troubles will pass
You'll find a woman and you'll find love
Just remember my son, there is someone up above"

"And be a simple kind of man
Oh, be something you love and understand
Baby be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me, son, if you can"

Don't you worry, you'll find yourself
Follow your heart and nothing else
And you can do this, if you try
All that I want for you, my son, is to be satisfied"

"And be a simple kind of man
Oh, be something you love and understand
Baby be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me, son, if you can"

I'll be a simple kind of man
Oh, I'll be something you love and understand
