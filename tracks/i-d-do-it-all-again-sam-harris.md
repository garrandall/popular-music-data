Sometimes my heart seems to slip away
To yesterday
When your eyes held all the answers
It's easier to keep the pain
And hope
But I can't forget
All the time I stayed inside the laughter

So if you want me
I'll be there
I'll be waiting at the top of the stairs
And if you want me you can call
I will catch you if you stumble and fall

Oh, I'd do it all again
The same thing happens
With the same sad end
Oh, I'd do it all again
I'd do it all again
Oh, oh

Time takes it's toll for the broken heart
But not so smart
I suppose I will always love you
Looking back to what I was before you came
I'm not the same, no
What you gave was what it took to pull through

So if you want me
I'll be there
I'll be waiting at the top of the stairs
And if you want me you can call
I will catch you if you stumble and fall

Oh, I'd do it all again
The same thing happens
With the same sad end
Oh, I'd do it all again
I'd do it all again
Oh, oh

I can forgive you
But I can't forget you
I never let you see
The tears behind my smile

Oh, I'd do it all again
The same thing happens
With the same sad end
Oh, I'd do it all again
I'd do it all again
Oh, oh

Do it all again
Do it all again
Do it all again
Do it all again
Oh, I'd do it all again

So if you want me
I'll be there
I'll be waiting at the top of the stairs
And if you want me you can call
I will catch you if you stumble and fall

So if you want me
I'll be there
I'll be waiting at the top of the stairs
And if you want me you can call
I will catch you if you stumble and fall
