Peter Rabbit and Little Boy Blue
Hidden in the brush with Mr. Magoo
Along came Mcdonald with his trusty gun
And he goes, everybody run

Peter Rabbit
Peter Rabbit
Peter Rabbit
He'll be hopping along

Peter Rabbit and Goldilocks
Out in the toolies
Eating porridge by the pot
Along came Mcdonald with his trusty gun
And he goes, everybody run

Peter Rabbit
Peter Rabbit
Peter Rabbit
He'll be hopping along

Peter Rabbit and the little red hen
Talking things over in the high wired pen
Along came Mcdonald with his trusty gun
And he goes, everybody run

Peter Rabbit
Peter Rabbit
Peter Rabbit
He'll be hopping along

Well, Peter Rabbit
Peter Rabbit
Peter Rabbit
He'll be hopping along

Well, Peter Rabbit
Peter Rabbit
Peter Rabbit...
