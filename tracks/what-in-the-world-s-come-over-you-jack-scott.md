What in the world's come over you?
Seems we never get along
Ev'ry night I reminisce dreaming of your tender kisses
What in the world's come over you?

Could you ever change your mind?
If you do, I'll still be here, dear, waiting, longing for you
All my life I've loved you so
Never dreamed I'd miss you so
Now, alone in my room each night
My heart, it cries "It's just not right"
What in the world's come over you?

Could you ever change your mind?
If you do, I'll still be here, dear, waiting, longing for you
All my life I've loved you so
Never dreamed I'd miss you so
Now, alone in my room each night
My heart, it cries "It's just not right"
What in the world's come over you?

You're still my angel from above
Guess you'll always be my one and only only real love
