Your wardrobe's purchased at the latest boutique
Your place is furnished like the President's suite
Your freezer's filled up with the finest of meat
Somehow you manage on a hundred a week
They say you like to feel white gold on your neck
They say when you make love you like to direct
And that new sports car you proceeded to wreck
They say I ought to ask who picked up the check
I can take care of myself
My friends all say I ought to think twice
I can take care of myself
I don't need nobody's advice
You're so nice
Attempts to charm you met with little success
I never met someone so hard to impress
Until one day by chance you saw my address
The next day you had on your lowest cut dress

(Repeat Chorus)
They could be correct in their judgment of you
Maybe you'll take me and make me a fool
But I'm a big boy and I know what to do
It might be worth it to wake up next to you

(Repeat Chorus)
I can take care of myself
I don't need nobody's advice
Oh I can take care of myself
I don't need nobody's advice
Yeah I can take care of myself
I don't need nobody's advice
