I thought sometime alone
Was what we really needed
You said this time would hurt more than it helps
But I couldn't see that
I thought it was the end
Of a beautiful story
And so I left the one I loved at home to be alone (alone)
And I tried to find
Out if this one thing is true
That I'm nothing without you
I know better now
And I've had a change of heart

I'd rather have bad times with you, than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm, than safe and warm by myself
I'd rather have hard times together, than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
Whoo-oo-oo-oo yeah

And then I met someone
And thought she could replace you
We got a long just fine
We wasted time because he was not you
We had a lot of fun
Though we knew we were faking
Love was not impressed with our connection they were all lies, all lies
So I'm here cause I found this one thing is true
That I'm nothing without you
I know better now
And I've had a change of heart

I'd rather have bad times with you, than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm, than safe and warm by myself
I'd rather have hard times together, than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
Who holds my heart

I can't blame you if you turn away from me, like I've done you
I can only prove the things I say with time
Please be mine

I'd rather have bad times with (please be mine) you
Than good times with someone else (I know)
I'd rather be beside you in a storm (anytime)
Than safe and warm by myself (so sure baby)
I'd rather have hard times to gether
Than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart (my heart)

I'd rather have bad times with you (surely)
Than good times with someone else (surely)
I'd rather be beside you in a storm (oh yeah)
Than safe and warm by myself (all by myself)
I'd rather have hard times together
Than to have it easy apart (you know it)
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart

I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
Whoooo.....who holds my heart
