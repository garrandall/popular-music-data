You know
I don't know what it is (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
But everything about you is so irresistible


Don't you try and tell me that he's not my type
To hide what I feel inside
When he makes me weak with desire
I know that I'm supposed to make him wait
Let him think I like the chase
But I can't stop fanning the fire
I know I meant to say no


But he's irresistible
Up close and personal
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe
More than just physical, deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me
Oh, that I can hardly breathe (Yeah yeah yeah)


Don't you think I'm trying to tell my heart what's right
That I should really say goodnight
But I can't stop myself from falling (Falling)
Maybe I'll tell him that I feel the same
That I don't wanna play no game (No)
'Cause when I feel his arms wrapped around me
I know I meant to say no (I meant to say no)


But he's irresistible (Irresistible)
Up close and personal
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe (I can hardly breathe)
More than just physical, deeper than spiritual (Oh, oh yeah)
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me


Can't you see?
Whenever he's close to me
I really find it hard to breathe
He's so irresistible
Baby, you know it's more than just spiritual
His kisses are powerful
He's so irresistible (He's so irresistible)


But he's irresistible (Yeah yeah)
Up close and personal (Oh yeah)
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe (I can hardly breathe)
More than just physical (Oh yeah), deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me
He's irresistible
Up close and personal (Yeah yeah)
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe (Irresistible to me)
More than just physical, deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me
