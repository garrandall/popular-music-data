There's another world that I can see
Where angels and demons are constantly fighting over me
There's another world inside of me
Where flesh battles spirit, I know, I can feel it
Both comfort me


Tears fall to the floor like TKO
Heartbreak âcause of pain never seen before
Blood spills, I get chills, itâs not even cold
From paradise to the leauges below
They after me, they chasin'
Friday the 13 like Jason
In the dash, my heartâs been racin'
Back and forth, man, I been pacin'
I know thereâs gotta be satan'
I know thereâs gotta be satan'
Or maybe itâs me Iâm facing
God please send me an angel
Or at least the police to arrest the thief
Tryna steal whatâs mine just to mess with me
Feels like Iâm in a trial, are you testinâ me?
Angels and demons, they stressin' me
Yeah, people swear that they blessin' me
Turns out to be the people thatâs vexin' me
Till I rest in peace, I thought you were a friend
But the sin is i begin
To pretend that lifeâs all about me
And these so called friends that take advantage of ya
Hate who you are, but swear they love ya
Itâs rare to get this, but the two are open

Holy Spirit Come, come, come
Holy spirit Come, come, come


This ainât nothin' I ever did
Not really how I ever live
I ainât tryna say I never slip
But I guarantee this, that the devil real
Never claiming that Iâm blameless
Thatâs a fact well known, like famous
Iâm adjusting where my aim is
But off in the dark, Iâm shameless
Tryna drown my sorrow, and make it till tomorrow
It ainât a promise, man, itâs just something I borrowed
Truth hurts most, so we hold a lot close
Side by side with another empty hope
Then the devil keeps on comin'
Iâm tired from the runnin'
It started out small, now this thang is enormous high
And it keeps on callin'
Hard to take a stand when you keep on fallin'
But it feel so good, seem so right
If the dark this good I dont ever want the light
Forever want the night, cause the feels like its fire
Right behind closed doors, no relief in sight
God do for me what I cannot do
What I really donât want, what I need make true
God do for me what I cannot do
What I really donât want, what I need make true

Thereâs another world that I can see
Where angels and demons are constantly fighting over me
Thereâs another world inside of me
Where flesh battles spirit I know I can feel it
Both comfort me
Holy spirit, come, come, come
Holy spirit, come, come, come
