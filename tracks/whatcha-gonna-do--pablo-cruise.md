Whatcha gonna do
When she says goodbye?
Whatcha gonna do
When she is gone?
Whatcha gonna do
When she says goodbye?
Whatcha gonna do
When she is gone?

So you're having trouble
With your romance
Well, you better check it out
Before it goes, yeah

'Cause you might not be seeing
Things just the way you should
And you don't recognize
What everybody knows

Whatcha gonna do
When she says goodbye?
Whatcha gonna do
When she is gone?
Whatcha gonna do
When she says goodbye?
Whatcha gonna do
When she is gone?

And all at once
You're ready to hang it up
'Cause things didn't turn out
The way you planned, no

And all your friends
They calling you a fool
'Cause you don't know
A good thing when you've
Got it in your hand

Whatcha gonna do
When she says goodbye?
Whatcha gonna do
When she is gone?
Whatcha gonna do
When she says goodbye?
Whatcha gonna do
When she is gone?

And all at once
You're ready to hang it up
'Cause things didn't turn out
The way you planned, no

And all your friends
They calling you a fool
'Cause you don't know
A good thing when you've
Got it in your hand

Whatcha gonna do
When she says goodbye?
Whatcha gonna do
When she is gone?
Whatcha gonna do
When she says goodbye?
Whatcha gonna do
When she is gone?

Whatcha gonna do
When she says goodbye?
Whatcha gonna do
When she is gone?
Whatcha gonna do
When she says goodbye?
Whatcha gonna do
When she is gone?
