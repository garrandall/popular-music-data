Don't be afraid, little darlin'
Let yourself fall in love with me
I'm not like that other guy
I'll never make you cry
I'll be as true as can be, you'll see

Don't be afraid, little darlin'
Come on, now don't you turn away
Just you forget your fears
And let me dry your tears
Tell me you'll let me stay

Give me a chance, little darlin'
To show you how sweet a love can be
You're gonna shine and you'll find the world's your valentine
If you just trust in me, come on now

Don't be afraid, little darlin'
Your love is all I'm living for
Yes, I'm livin' for the day I'm gonna hear you say
You're not afraid of me any more

Don't be afraid, little darlin'
Your love is all I'm living for
Yes, I'm livin' for the day I'm gonna hear you say
You're not afraid of me any more

Aww, don't be afraid, little darlin'
Don't be afraid, little darlin'
