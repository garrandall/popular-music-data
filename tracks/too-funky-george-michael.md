Hey, you're just too funky for me
I gotta get inside of you
And I'll show you heaven if you let me
Hey you're just too funky for me
I gotta get inside, (I gotta get inside)
I gotta get inside of you (So when will that be?)
I watch you're fingers working overtime (Overtime)
I've got to thinking that they should be mine. Oh!
I'd love to see you naked baby
I'd like to think that sometime maybe
Tonight, if that's alright. Yeah!

Hey, you're just too funky for me
I gotta get inside of you , (Won't let you go)
I won't let you, no-no
Hey you're just too funky for me
I gotta get inside, (I gotta get inside)
I gotta get inside of you (I'll let you love me)
I watch you drinkin' and I take my time
I watch you sinkin' all over that cheap red wine, Oh!
I've got to see you naked baby
I'd like to think that sometime maybe
Tonight my goal's in sight, Yeah!

Baby, baby, baby, why do you do this to me?
Won't let you go, (Won't let you go)
You're such a, you're such a
Baby, baby, baby, why do you do this to me?

(I'm gonna be the kind of lover that you never had)
Hey you're just too funky
(You're never gonna have another lover in your bed)
You're just too funky for me

(Would you like me to seduce you, is that what you're trying to tell me?)
(Everybody wants a lover like that)
Baby,

(Is that what you are trying to tell me?)
(Everybody wants a lover, everybody wants a lover like that
Everybody wants a lover, everybody wants a lover like that
Everybody wants a lover, everybody wants a lover like that
Everybody wants a lover, everybody wants a lover like that)
