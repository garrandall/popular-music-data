Come in this house, stop all that yackety yack
Come in this house, baby, stop all that yackety yack
Ah, look out my darling, I don't want no talkin' back

You've been runnin' out gossipin', headin' at yackety yack
You've been runnin' out gossipin', headin' at yackety yack
They don't care nothin' 'bout you, they say you're just an alley cat

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on in this house, baby, stop all that yackety yack

If I need you again, baby, I won't be back no more
If I need you again, baby, I won't be back no more
Ah, turn off the waterworks, baby, that don't move me no more

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on in this house, baby, stop all that yackety yack

Come on in, baby, stop all that yackety yack
Come on in this house, baby, stop all that yackety yack
And don't make me nervous, 'cause I'm holdin' up a baseball bat

Come on baby
Come on baby
Come on baby
Come on baby
Come on in this house, baby, stop all that yackety yack

Come on baby
