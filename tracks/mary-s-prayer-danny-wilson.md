Everything is wonderful
Being here is heavenly
Every single day, she says
Everything is free

I used to be so careless
As if I couldn't care less
Did I have to make mistakes
When I was Mary's prayer?

Suddenly, the heavens roared
Suddenly, the rain came down
Suddenly was washed away
The Mary that I knew

So when you find somebody who keep
Think of me and celebrate
I made such a big mistake
When I was Mary's prayer

So if I say save me, save me
Be the light in my eyes
And if I say ten Hail Marys
Leave a light on in Heaven for me

Blessed is the one who shares
Your power and your beauty, Mary
Blessed is the millionaire
Who shares your wedding day

So when you find somebody who keep
Think of me and celebrate
I made such a big mistake
When I was Mary's prayer

So if I say save me, save me
Be the light in my eyes
And if I say ten Hail Marys
Leave a light on in Heaven

Save me, save me
Be the light in my eyes
And if I say ten Hail Marys
Leave a light on in Heaven for me

If you want the fruit to fall
You have to give the tree a shake
But if you shake the tree too hard
The bough is gonna break

And if I can't reach the top of the tree
Oh, Mary, you can pull me up there
What I wouldn't give to be
When I was Mary's prayer

So if I say save me, save me
Be the light in my eyes
And if I say ten Hail Marys
Leave a light on in Heaven

Save me, save me
Be the light in my eyes
And if I say ten Hail Marys
Leave a light on in Heaven

Save me, save me
Be the light in my eyes
What I wouldn't give to be
When I was Mary's prayer

What I wouldn't give to be
When I was Mary's prayer
Save me (What I wouldn't give to be)
When I was Mary's prayer
