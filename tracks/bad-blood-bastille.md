I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna talk about it


Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh


We were young and drinking in the park
There was nowhere else to go
And you said you always had my back
Oh, but how were we to know?


That these are the days that bind you
Together, forever
And these little things define you
Forever, forever


All this bad blood here
Won't you let it dry?
It's been cold for years
Won't you let it lie?


Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh


If we're only ever looking back
We will drive ourselves insane
As the friendship goes, resentment grows
We will walk our different ways


That those are the days that bind us
Together, forever
And those little things define us
Forever, forever


All this bad blood here
Won't you let it dry?
It's been cold for years
Won't you let it lie?


And I don't wanna hear about the bad blood anymore
I don't wanna hear you talk about it anymore
I don't wanna hear about the bad blood anymore
I don't wanna hear you talk about it anymore


All this bad blood here
Won't you let it dry?
It's been cold for years
Won't you let it lie?


Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
