Shouldn't we two be together?
You know what I mean
To be with you is something like a dream (You know what I mean)
And if you want me to
I'll bring sunshine to you only

You better stop, take a look about
You know what I mean
If only you could see the dreams that seem to mean so much to me
Then you'd know the reason why
I would love to say "I do" than say
"Goodbye" and let you go forever
Wouldn't we two be together?

Can't you see that I want you (Why can't you see?)
For me forever
Wouldn't we two be together?
Do you know what I mean? Can't you read in between the lines?
Sometimes I'm talking and it doesn't seem too clear
But, if you have to know (But if you have to know)
I'm in love with only you know what I mean (I'm in love)

Do you know what I mean? (Know what I mean?)
Do you know what I mean? (Do you know what I mean?)
Do you know what I mean? (Know what I mean?)
Do you know what I mean? (Do you know what I mean?)
Do you know what I mean? (Do you know what I mean?)
Do you know what I mean? (Do you know what I mean?)
Do you know what I mean? (Do you know what I mean?)
Do you know what I mean? (Know what I mean?)
