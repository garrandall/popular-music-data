It's gonna be me
(Oh, yeah)


You might've been hurt, babe
That ain't no lie
You've seen them all come and go, oh
I remember you told me
That it made you believe in
No man, no cry
Maybe that's why


Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody
Guess what?
It's gonna be me


You've got no choice, babe
But to move on, and you know
There ain't no time to waste
You're just too blind (Too blind), to see
But in the end, you know it's gonna be me
You can't deny
So just tell me why


Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody
Guess what
It's gonna be me


It's gonna be me
(Oh, yeah)


There comes a day
When I'll be the one, you'll see
It's gonna-gonna-gonna-gonna-gonna
It's gonna be me


All that I do
Is not enough for you
Don't wanna lose it
But I'm not like that
When finally (finally)
You get to love
Guess what (guess what)


Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody
Guess what
It's gonna be me


Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody
Guess what
It's gonna be me
