You got a smile so bright
You know you could have been a candle
I'm holding you so tight
You know you could have been a handle
The way you swept me off my feet
You know you could've been a broom
And babe you smell so sweet
You know you could've been some perfume

Well you could have been anything that you wanted to
I can tell
The way you do the things you do

As pretty as you are
You know you could've been a flower
If good looks were minutes
You know you could have been an hour
The way you stole my heart
You know you could have been a crook
And baby your so smart
You know you could have been a school book

Well you could have been anything that you wanted to
I can tell
The way you do the things you do

Well you could have been

You make my life so rich
You know you could've been some money
And baby you're so sweet
You know you could have been some honey

Well you could have been anything that you wanted to
I can tell
The way you do the things you do

Well you could have been

As pretty as you are
You know you could've been a flower
If good looks were minutes
You know you could have been an hour
The way you stole my heart
You know you could have been a crook
And baby your so smart
You know you could have been a school book

Well you could have been anything that you wanted to
I can tell
The way you do the things you do

Well you could have been
