I stayed up all night
Waiting for you to call
But something ain't right
'Cause night after night I get lonely

It's been awhile
Since I've seen that look in your eyes
Now that you're gone
I can't go on without you

And deep (deep) inside (inside) my heart
I had a feeling right from the start
You didn't love me
And deep (deep) inside (inside) my heart
I had a feeling you tore apart
You didn't want me
Like I wanted you
Like I wanted you

I turned out the light
I tossed and I turned until dawn
I couldn't sleep
I just couldn't keep from cryin'

I'll never learn
Whatever I do, I get burned
You went away
Now I face the day without you

And deep (deep) inside (inside) my heart
I had a feeling right from the start
You didn't love me
And deep (deep) inside (inside) my heart
I had a feeling you tore apart
You didn't want me
Like I wanted you (like I wanted you)
Like I wanted you (like I wanted you)
Like I wanted you (like I wanted you)
Like I wanted you (yeah, like I wanted you)

And deep (deep) inside (inside) my heart
I had a feeling you tore apart
You didn't want me
Like I wanted you (I wanted you)
Like I wanted you (like I wanted you)
Like I wanted you (like I wanted you)
Like I wanted you
