I really can't stay
Baby, it's cold outside
I gotta go away
Baby, it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice

My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to that fire place roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
But maybe just half a drink more
I'll put some records on while I pour

The neighbors might think
Baby, it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell
I'll take your hat (well, thank you), your hair looks swell

I ought to say no, no, no, sir
Mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense of hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
Baby, don't hold out
Baby, it's cold outside

(You're very pushy, you know)
(I'd like to think of it as opportunistic)

I simply must go
Baby, it's cold outside
The answer is "No"
But, baby, it's cold outside
(come on)
The welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm

My sister will be suspicious
Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Gosh, your lips are delicious
But maybe just a cigarette more
(and I don't even smoke)
Never such a blizzard before

I gotta get home
Baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your coat
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I feel when I touch your hand
But don't you see
How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life-long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you got pneumonia and died
I really can't stay
Get over that hold-out
Baby, it's cold
Baby, it's cold outside

(OK, fine, just another drink then
Well, that took a lot of convincing)
