Wasn't the summer short?
Didn't it seem to fly?
Where are the nights we thought we'd find
Our love under summer skies?

Didn't that careless moon
Forget to find us?
Didn't the month of June
Fail utterly to remind us that...

Autumn comes all too soon.
Midsummer madness dies.
Nothing is quite the same when leaves
Turn gold 'neath September skies.
Why did we let this magic time go by?
Wasn't the summer short?
Didn't it fly?
