You know everybody, no matter who they are
And no matter how different they might be
Always runs across the same problem at least once
And that's the problem of love
And maybe just once in your life
You're gonna fall in love with somebody so bad
And it's gonna be somebody that don't need you at all
Somebody that's got everything in the world there is to have
And, and you got nothin'
I, I who have nothing, I, I who have no one
Adore you and love you so
I'm just a no one with nothing to give you, but love
I love you
And then you guys
You're gonna have to tell her something too
So, you walk up to that girl and you say
He, he buys you diamonds, bright sparkling diamonds
But believe me, hear what I say
He can buy you the world but he'll never love the way
I love you
Listen here
He can take you any place he wants
To fancy clubs and restaurants
While I can only watch you with
My nose pressed up against the window pane
And then, just when you think
That everything that you've gone and done
And everything that you've said has worked
And then you find out it didn't work at all
And when you're all alone you're gonna think
About that person that you sought so bad
And you're gonna turn out the lights
And you're gonna cry all to yourself
I, I who have nothing, I, I who have no one
Must watch you go dancing by
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else when darling, it's I
Who loves you, who loves you
Who loves you
