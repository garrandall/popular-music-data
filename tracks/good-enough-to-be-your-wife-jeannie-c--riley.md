You ask me if we con live together
Marriage doesn't fit your way of life
And you say that you'll be with me forever
Well if that's true please make me your wife

Cause if I'm good enough to be your woman good enough to share your life
Good enough to live together I'm good enough to be your wife
Good enough to have your children good enough to give 'em life
Good enough to do your cooking I'm good enough to be your wife

I don't care what people say about us
Loving one another isn't wrong
And I don't care as long as we're together
Right here next to you's where I belong

But if I'm good enough to be your woman...

Darling I'm so glad you want me with you
But sharin' someone's life just ain't the game
So with you really want to live together
Then first of all I've got to have your name

Cause if I'm good enough to be your woman...
