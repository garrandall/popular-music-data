Beachboy in the sun, yeah
Look, I know you
You just wanna fuck me for the fame
Wanna fuck me cause them diamonds on my chain
Girl, don't you? Don't you?
Yeah, oh

Look, I know you
You just wanna fuck me for my fame
Girl, don't you?
You just wanna fuck me for the fame
Yeah, don't you?
You just wanna fuck me for the fame
She wanna fuck me cause them diamonds on my chain
Girl, I know you
You be out here playin' all them games
Girl, don't you?
Out here fuckin' with all of them lames
Don't you? Don't you? I know you


Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Big body she gon' swerve it
Now we went by the surface
Shorty lookin' picture perfect
Say she ready, never nervous
I wanna know like its urgent
Give her good pipe when in person
You want the cars and the purses
Baby girl, tell me is it worth it
I'm in a spaceship
Get ready for takeoff
Can't fuck with lil' shorty
I know that she basic
She makin' my dick soft
These niggas hatin'
Said I wouldn't make it
I shine with a new floss
I got his girl in a room gettin' naked
She fuck with a real boss
When my gang walk in it's lit (it's lit)
Legit (legit)
Give her the D then she dismiss (dismiss)
No kiss (no kiss)
You test me then you getting hit (hit)
Lil' bitch (lil' bitch)
I take my shot and I don't miss (don't miss)
My diamonds piss (piss)
And girl that's funny 'cause I know you
You just come around and make a name
Girl, I know you, gon' tell me that you different and you changed
But I know you-
Are everything you say you ain't
You tried to take me down, I left you in the rain


Look, I know you
You just wanna fuck me for my fame
Girl, don't you?
You just wanna fuck me for the fame
Yeah, don't you?
You just wanna fuck me for the fame
She wanna fuck me cause the diamonds on my chain
Girl, I know you
You be out here playin' all them games
Girl, don't you?
Out here fuckin' with all of them lames
Don't you? Don't you? I know you

Look
She want the money and the fame
Told her you gotta go
I ain't gon' give your ass a thing
She want a pot of gold
Back when I was young I had a lot of hoes
I'm talking back before I got this dough
Now I see how they rockin'
I know how you roll now
Ain't no need for talkin'
That shit gettin' old now
Left me with no option
But to keep knockin' these doors down
Left me with no option
But to keep knockin' these hoes down (hold up, wait)
Gucci down to the socks (ho yeah)
That's a beach boy, baby
Pull up to the party, shawty all up on me
Now she wanna date me
Said she wanna have my baby
I ain't know that was your lady (oh no)
I've been workin' off the clock for this shit
Did a lot for this shit
Please don't expect me just to give it up
Shorty wanna rock with the kid
I gave her cock then I dipped
Told lil mama go ahead and live it up

Look, I know you
You just wanna fuck me for my fame
Girl, don't you?
You just wanna fuck me for the fame
Yeah, don't you?
You just wanna fuck me for the fame
She wanna fuck me cause the diamonds on my chain
Girl, I know you
You be out here playin' all them games
Girl, don't you?
Out here fuckin' with all of them lames
Don't you? Don't you? I know you
