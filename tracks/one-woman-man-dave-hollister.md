Alright, (hm)
It's so funny runnin' into you
It has to be three years
Since we last seen each other
Many flashbacks come to mind
Of the wild and crazy times
We used to have with one another

We absolutely didn't care
We would do it anywhere
Eye contact, and it was over, hm
But that's when I was wild, and now
I couldn't care less about
Someone gettin' hurt
I've done my share of dirt
But I done wised up

Chorus - Seein' you reminds me of
All the nights I used to beat it up
I would do it again, but I can't
Cuz everything is different now
I finally have settled down
And became a one woman man

Oh
There were many others after you
Quite a few one night stands
Some of their names I can't remember
Imagine wakin' up with someone who
You barely even knew
Time and time again

But there's someone for everyone
I've been blessed to find that one
Who makes me feel like no other
You are lookin' good as hell
But I can't go home with you
Because I'm goin' home to her


Long gone, are the days
When I ran the streets
Tryin' to get laid
Oh, and now
(See now that I found the love of my life)
(I don't have to trick no more)
Girl, it was nice seein' you
But I gotta go home to my baby boo

Chorus to fade
