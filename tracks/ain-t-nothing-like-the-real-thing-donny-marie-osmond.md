Ain't nothing like the real thing baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

Oh baby, I got your picture
Hanging on the wall
But it can't see or come to me
When I call your name
I realize it's just a picture
Inside a frame
I read your letters when you're not near me
But they don't move me
And they don't groove me
Like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear

Ain't nothing like the real thing baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

I played the game of fantasy
I pretend I'm not in reality
I need the shelter of your arms
To comfort me
No other sound is quite the same
As your name
No touch can do as half as much
To make me feel better
So let's stay together
I've got some memories to look back on
Though they help when you're gone
I'm well aware
Nothing can take the place of your nearness

So glad we got the real thing baby
So glad we got the real thing
So glad we got the real thing baby
So glad we got the real thing

Repeat last verse and fade.
