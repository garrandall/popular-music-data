Lost, lost as a child's first thought. I must have arms to hold me.
Lost without lovin' care. I must have my fair share.
Fair, fair is a changing word. Fair is an honored promise.
Justice if you're still there. I will have my fair share.
Justice is a lady. Lay me down with justice in a long white gown.
With a breath of love, we can share.
Share, sleep with me if you dare. Celebrate my fair share.

Fair, fair is a changing word. Fair is an honored promise.
Justice if you're still there. I will have my fair share.
Justice is a lady. Lay me down with justice in a long white gown.
With a breath of love, we can share.
Share, sleep with me if you dare. Celebrate my fair share.
