If you were mine
I'd take you on a
Trip around the world
If you were mine
I'd buy you diamonds and pearls

If you were mine
I'd so be so tender
Sweet and kind
If you were mine
I'd make love to you all night
Only if you were mine

Hey, girl, listen up
Cause you know it's true
There's no one more qualified
For me than you

If you were mine
You know things would
Be kinda right
I don't beg, girl
But for you, I just might

Get down upon my knees
And beg and plead
To make you realize
It's you that I need

You're the main reason
I dress to impress
And hope so maybe one day
I will end all this lonlieness

You're on my mind
You're what I think about most
I dream of nights of us alone
Girl, I'm holding you close

I will be yours forever
If you're forever mine
Girl, it's just a matter of time

If you were mine
If you were mine
If you were mine
If you were mine

You know, if you were my girl
I would be so true
I would live just to give
All my love to you

You've been mistreated
By all those guys
Didn't understand
Or even realize

That a lady needs love
Tenderness and care
Someone they can call
And who will always be there

To pick em up when they're done
Make em happy when they're blue
If you were my girl
That's what I'd do

I'd take you out, do you right
Buy you things you like
I'd try not to fuss
And try not to fight

And if things got bad
And push come to shove
I'd still be dedicated
To the girl that I love

If you were mine
If you were mine
If you were mine
If you were mine

Girl, don't waste my time
Cause my love is genuine
I've got to make you mine
Yo, Marlon, get busy one time

If you were mine
I'd take you on a
Trip around the world
If you were mine
I'd buy you diamonds and pearls

If you were mine
I'd so be so tender
Sweet and kind
If you were mine, I'd make
Love to you all the time
Only if you were mine
