Forever, forever, forever
So you're having my baby
And it means so much to me
There's nothing more precious
Than to raise a family
If there's any doubt in your mind
You can count on me
I'll never let you down
Lady believe in me



You and i
Will never fall apart
You and i
We knew right from the start, baby, baby
The day
We fell so far in love
Now our baby is born, healthy and strong
Now our dreams are reality



Forever my lady
It's like a dream
I'm holding you close
You're keeping me warm
If this is ecstacy
Forever my lady
I say just what i mean
Forever and ever
I pray is what i see

Can you picture my lady
This empty scene
There's no me or no you
What will we do
An awful sight to me
If i ever lose you
Tell me where would i go
Life would have no meaning
And i pray that you will always stay with me

You and i
Would never fall apart, baby
You and i
Said we knew right from the start
The day
We fell so far in love
Now our baby is born
Healthy and strong
Now our dreams are reality

Forever my lady
It's like a dream
I'm holding you close
You're keeping me warm
If this is ecstacy
Forever my lady
I say just what i mean
Forever and ever
I pray is what i see

Lady, you and i
Will never fall apart,no no
You and i
I say we made it
And i say we made it from the start
The day
We fell so far in love
Now our baby is born
So healthy and strong
Now my dreams are reality
Yeahhhhhh
Forever my lady
Ah yeah, baby
Forever my lady
Woo oooh
Said i pray every night, baby
Forever my lady
And every day of the week
