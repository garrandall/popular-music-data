Lookin' 'round at all the faces
I can see they're all the same
Drifting shadows on the sidewalk
Slowly walking in the rain

The moon shines down, she sees, she knows
And I follow, through rain and sun

But you see I'm walking in my sleep
(can't you see I'm walking in my sleep?)
And I don't know how I got here
(and I don't know, no)
And when I try to keep the beat
You see I'm walking in my sleep

Didn't know that I was dreaming
Sunny days come out of midnight
In the darkness of the evening
Running softly from the light

The moon shines down, she sees, she knows
The star, the end, the tide, the flow
The night, so black, it looks so real
Am I awake, or am I dreaming still?

But you see I'm walking in my sleep
(can't you see I'm walking in my sleep?)
And I don't know how I got here
(and I don't know, no)
And when I try to keep the beat
You see I'm walking in my sleep

And through this nightmare, the dream unfolds
I'm by a window, the night so cold
My mind, my body, my room, this heat
A drain is pouring into the street

But you see I'm walking in my sleep
(can't you see I'm walking in my sleep?)
And I don't know how I got here
(and I don't know, no)
And when I try to keep the beat
You see I'm walking in my sleep...
