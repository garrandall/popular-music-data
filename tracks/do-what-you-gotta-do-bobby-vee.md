Girl, I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a guy like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know

I've loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start, it's my own
Gault for what happens to my heart
You see, I've always known you'd go

So you just do what you gotta do
My wild, sweet love (sweet, sweet love)
Thought it may mean I'll never
Kiss your sweet lips again

Pay that no mind
Just chase that dappled dream of yours
(Do what you gotta do)
Come on back and see me when you can

Now I know they make you sad
Make you feel so bad
They say that you don't
Treat me like you should
They got ways to make you feel no good
But I guess they've got no way to know

I've had my eyes wide open from the start
Girl, you never lied to me
The part of you they'll never, never see
Is the part you've shown to me

Now you just do what you gotta do
My wild, sweet love (sweet, sweet love)
Thought it may mean I'll never
Kiss your sweet lips again

Pay that no mind
Just chase that dappled dream of yours
(Do what you gotta do)
Come on back and see me when you can

Now you just do what you gotta do
My wild, sweet love (sweet, sweet love)
Thought it may mean I'll never
Kiss your sweet lips again

Pay that no mind
Just chase that dappled dream of yours
(Do what you gotta do)
Come on back and see me when you can
