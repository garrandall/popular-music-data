You go out when you get ready
And you come home when you please
You just love me when you want me baby
And you think it outta be all right with me

When I try to talk to you baby
And let you know just how I feel
You tell me if I don't like it
You know someone else will

Oh, but I done got wise to you baby
You're not the only bird in the sky
Oh so don't ask me no questions now baby
And I, I won't tell you no lies

Because I like to feel arms around me
And lips close, close to mine
So I don't have to beg you to love me
I don't have to beg you all the time

Oh, but I done got wise to you baby
You're not the only bird in the sky
So now don't ask me no questions baby
And you know I won't, I won't tell you no lies

Yes you can love me if you want me
Or you keep on flaying the field
Because I know if you don't love me
I know there's somebody else that will
