I wish I could have met you
In a year or two
Ah, maybe then you could have seen me
What I saw in you

On the day we met
You were still trying to forget someone
You used to know
And there just wasn't enough time
Between her goodbye and my hello

Boy, I want to try for a while
But I could always see
A place I can fill
To love for a memory

'Cause at the mention of her name
I could still see the flame burning
Soft and low
And there just wasn't enough time
Between her goodbye and my hello

Oh, time is the healer, I want you to know
Especially those heartbreaking kind
Lord, it looks like I just came along too soon
'Cause she still takes up too much of your mind

If I pass that on, it cost on a later day
I know we could have made it, baby
We're almost fading it away

But you weren't completely free
'Cause someone else's memory
Just wouldn't let you go
And there just wasn't enough time
Between her goodbye

In between her goodbye and my hello
In between her goodbye and my hello
In between her goodbye and my hello
In between her goodbye and my hello
In between her goodbye and my hello

Baby, all we needed was a little more time
I needed that time to build the thing and make you mine
