Last night, I said these words to my girl
I know you never even try, girl


Come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Please please me, whoa yeah, like I please you


You don't need me to show the way, love
Why do I always have to say, love?


Come on (Come on), Come on (Come on)
Come on (Come on), Come on (Come on)
Please please me, whoa yeah, like I please you


I don't want to sound complaining
But you know there's always rain in my heart (in my heart)
I do all the pleasing with you it's so hard to reason
With you, whoa yeah, why do you make me blue?


Last night, I said these words to my girl
I know you never even try girl


Come on (Come on) Come on (Come on)
Come on (Come on) Come on (Come on)
Please, please me, whoa yeah, like I please you
Me, whoa yeah, like I please you
Me, whoa yeah, like I please you
Me, whoa yeah, like I please you
