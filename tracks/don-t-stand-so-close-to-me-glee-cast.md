Young teacher
The subject of schoolgirl fantasy
She wants him so badly
Knows what she wants to be
With all the charms of a woman
You've kept the secret of your youth
Bookmark it, she's so close now
This girl is half his age

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Young girl, you're out of your mind
Your love for me is way out of line
Better run, girl
You're much too young, girl

Temptation, frustration
So bad it makes him cry
Beneath your perfume and makeup
You're just a baby in disguise
Get out of here
Before you have the time to change your mind
'Cause I'm afraid you'll go too far

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Young girl, you're out of your mind
Your love for me is way out of line
Better run, girl
You're much too young, girl
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
You're much too young, girl
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
You're much too young, girl
