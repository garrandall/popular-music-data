Well she's my woman of gold
And she's not very old, a ha ha
Well she's my woman of gold
And she's not very old, a ha ha
I don't mean to be bold, but may I hold your hand?

Well she ain't not a witch
And I love the way she twitch, a ha ha
Well she ain't not a witch
And I love the way she twitch, a ha ha
I'm a labour of love in my Persian gloves, a ha ha

Well she's faster than most
And she lives on the coast, a ha ha
Well she's faster than most
And she lives on the coast, a ha ha
I'm her two penny prince and I give her hot love, a ha ha

Well she ain't not a witch
And I love the way she twitch, a ha ha
Well she ain't not a witch
And I love the way she twitch, a ha ha
I'm her two penny prince and I give her hot love, a ha ha
