Yo party people in da house
Yo bang that shit
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang that shit
Zhiggy, zhiggy, zhiggy, zhiggy, zhiggy, zhiggy, uh

(Missy)
When I had no dough
And I was low
She didn't want me
(What'cha say T?)
When I didn't buy her clothes
From the store
She wouldn't flaunt me (Uh)
Now I bag up all the hoes and I know
That she digs me
(What'cha say boo?)
She ripped me off like clothes
I suppose
(Yo zhiggy, zhiggy take that)

1 - 
Take that, get back
Dumb chicks tryna take my scratch
Hey trick, get back
Unless you gon let me hit that
Take that, get back
Dumb chicks tryna take my scratch
Hey trick, get back
Cuz I might have to...


Zhiggy, zhiggy, zhiggy uh yo
Bang that shit, bang, bang, bang that shit
Yo uh

(Missy)
When I had no car, no car
She wouldn't call me
(What'cha got boo?)
Now she think I'm a star
I'm a star
Now she follow me (he-he, uh)
Had to change all my codes
To my phones (yo)
Coulda had me first, me first
(Yo, so you tell her, uh)

Repeat 1


Zhiggy, zhiggy, zhiggy uh yo
Bang that shit, nigga bang that shit
Zhiggy uh

(Missy ad-libs in background)
This is for the playa in you
This means I'm not fuckin' wit' you
This means no more money for you
This means you can get the steppin'
This is for the playa in you
This means I'm not fuckin' wit' you
This means no more money for you
This means you can get the steppin'

Repeat 1 (2x)


Bang, bang, bang, bang that shit
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang that shit nigga uh
Bang, bang that shit
Bang, bang, bang, bang that shit
Yo, yo bang that shit
Bang, bang, bang, bang that shit
