I would give my life for you
You mean the world to me
Baby baby baby babe
You know I love you (uh huh Come on yea yea)
And I wanna be together when you runaway (Its NB Ryders)
Just me and you (Same Klick new title)
Just you and me
Will you runaway with me

The day I wrote these words for you I cried
Could of died that day a happy and complete man
Cuz in the palm of my hands
Everything that I dreamed for and more
And you know I'm down for yours
Forever and life the reason why I made you my wife is because
You see me for me the real me and love me unconditionally
And even with the circumstances that I had you still gave me a chance
And that's why I live and breathe for you and the kids
And you give me more than what this thing could ever give to me
And now my life is satisfied and complete visions are coming true
Yea of me and you placing rings on each others fingers saying "I do"
You stuck with me through my thick and my thin to go back and live life over
Again
Nah this is my destiny it was worth the agony to get the ecstasy

(Chorus)
We can runaway and spend some time
I'll always be the one right by your side
Tell the whole world you belong to me
You are my everything
I wanna run away with you
Do do do do do do do do

I never ever met a shorty that was quite like you
And even though it was wrong I fell in love with you
Now we sit here not really knowing what to do
But I'm sure that you know I'll give the world for you
If I could runaway with you I wouldn't even think twice
I promise girl I'll put it all on the line
I know forever seems to be a long time
But thats what I'm seeing when I look into your eyes
And it don't matter what your friends might say
Cuz I know deep inside you feel the same way
You could tell me what u want but I could read your mind
So quit lying to yourself and put ya hand in mine
I get excited everytime you come close
And being right here with you is what I love the most
So any time your feeling lonely inside
We could runaway together and leave this world behind

(Chorus)
We can runaway and spend some time
I'll always be the one right by your side
Tell the whole world you belong to me
You are my everything
I wanna run away with you
Do do do do do do do do

Waking up in the morning and your still not there
Can't we runaway and escape somewhere
Missing your soft touch your lips next to mine
Holdin up your hands as you look in my eyes
What must of happened to the love we both felt inside
Emotions were strong and the feeling was right
Now we don't speak anymore you went your own way
If thats what loves about then I was mislead
Go ahead and take your time if thats what you need
My loves for you forever my heart for you bleeds
Things happen for a reason so I ask my self should I be strong
And wait or move on to someone else
I know you still love me I could feel it inside
You always kept it real no games no lies
If your ever feelin lonely feel the need to get away
Call me up I'll be there together we'll run away girl

(Chorus)
We can runaway and spend some time
I'll always be the one right by your side
Tell the whole world you belong to me
You are my everything
I wanna run away with you
Do do do do do do do do
