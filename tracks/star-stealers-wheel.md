So they made you a star, now your head's in a cloud,
Now you're walking down the street with your feet off the ground
They read in the press all about your success,
They believe every word they've been told.
After all you've been through tell me what will you do,
When you find yourself out in the cold?

When you appear on the stage there's a standing ovation,
You really live out your performance, you're the biggest sensation.
You breeze through the door and when you take the floor
You expect to have it all to yourself.
After all you've been through tell me what will you do
When you find yourself back on the shelf?

You breeze through the door and when you take the floor
You expect to have it all to yourself.
After all you've been through tell me what will you do
When you find yourself back on the shelf?
