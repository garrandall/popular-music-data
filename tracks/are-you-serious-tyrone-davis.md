For years, I've waited
And i'll wait again
I know patience is a virtue
But I'm wearing thin

I've got my fingers crossed
Praying every night
That i'll find someone like you
To treat me right

Oh, oh, girl
Are you serious
Or just having fun
Are you serious
Tell me, are you the one

I know from experience
I've got to play it cool
You're not like the others
Using me like a tool

Is this another trap
Baited full of pain
Can I really trust you, girl
Or are you playing a game

Oh, oh, girl
Are you serious
Or just having fun
Are you serious
Tell me, are you the one

(Are you serious) oh, baby

Are you serious
Or just having fun
Are you serious
Tell me, are you the one

Me for you, you for me
(Serious) oh, baby

Are you serious
Or are you having fun
Are you serious
Tell me, are you the one

Are you serious, baby
Are you having fun
Are you serious

Are you serious
Tell me, are you the one
You and me, you and me

(Are you serious)
You and me, baby
