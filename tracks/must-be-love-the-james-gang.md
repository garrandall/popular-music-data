Lord I'm feelin'
Kinda weak in the knees
Somebody help me if I fall please

My head is spinnin'
But I can't get enough
Got the feelin'
It must be love

You can't see
I ain't got much sleep
Bags under my eyes clear down to my cheeks
My head is spinning but I can't get enough
Got this feelin'
Must be love


Must be love, must be love
Woahh, oohhh, must be love

Now I enjoy the time I spent
A-livin' alone
But I've been thinkin' about
Sharin' my home
My head is spinning but I can't get enough
Got this feelin'
Must be love





I'm not complainin'
Sometimes I'm feelin' so good
I never thought it would
Happen this way
Whole lotta' lightning
Come down from the sky
Hit me so hard it
Take my breath away
