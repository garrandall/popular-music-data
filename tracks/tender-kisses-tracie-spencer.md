I'm so confused
And I think I'm gonna cry tonight
What must I do, babe?
You don't know what you mean, oh
Tell me something
Tell me could this really be

You're so unpredictable
Why must you treat me this way?
I want you to love me
For who I am


Whatever happened to the dream
We used to share?
Where did our love go?
Boy, don't you even care?


Tender kisses
Blown away
Tender kisses
Gone tomorrow, gone today
Tender kisses
Bye baby, bye baby


Don't leave
Leave me here all alone
I want someone I can call my own
I may be young
But I'm ready
Ready to fall in love

Im so confused
You're so unpredictable
Trust in me
As I trust in you
Put our hearts together
There's nothing we can't do

I wonder if you ever loved me
Tell me, was I so blind
That I could not see

Holding on to the memories
Of the way you used to kiss me
All I ever really wanted
Was someone to call my own

I'll never know
You'll never know
We'll never know
All those tender kisses blown away

Bye baby, bye
