Hey, hey, hey
You've seen the world
You went out with every girl
But let me hip you
I won't be your second fiddle girl
All your letters
You said you were true
When I got back
I heard the news
So let me hip you
I won't be your second fiddle girl
Hey, hey, hey
You know I love you
Do anything you ask me to
But in this case
I won't be your second fiddle girl
I packed your things
Now there's the door
Stay out of my life
I don't want you no more
So let me tell you that
I won't be your second fiddle girl
Hey, hey, hey
You know I love you
Do anything you ask me to
But in this case
I won't be your second fiddle girl
I won't be your second fiddle girl
I won't be your second fiddle girl
I won't be your second fiddle girl...
