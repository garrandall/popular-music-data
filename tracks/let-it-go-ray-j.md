Uh huh, yeah
Uh huh, yeah

Come on y'all
Don't stop y'all
Gotta make y'all rock, y'all
Come on y'all
Don't stop y'all
Stevie gotta make ya rock, y'all

Every now and then it invades my mind
Some have missed a place through the hard times
From the 9 to 5 or just a world they see
But get your boogey shoes, there's a remedy

I insist that you relax and let it go
I insist that you believe it's gonna get better
I insist you understand right now you can't do nothin' better
So let it go

(1) - Everybody's out on the floor don't you know
Can't do nothin better so let it go
Set your troubles free
Dance with me
Loose control
Let it go

Every now and then it seems hard to find
Some have lost their way of loving, peace of mind
And if there's any pain or hostility
Well get down on the floor cuz there's a remedy

I insist that you be down and ready to party
I insist that you relax and let it go
I insist that you believe it's gonna get better
I insist you understand right now you can't do nothin' better
So let it go

(Repeat 1)

Let it go
Guess it's time to let it go
Even if your feelings show
It's ok to let it go
Guess it's time to let it

A one-two
A one-two
A one-two

Come on y'all Don't stop y'all

(Repeat 1)

Can't do nothin better so let it go

(Repeat 1)

Come on y'all Don't stop y'all
Stevie's gotta make ya rock y'all
Don't stop y'all

Uh huh
Yeah They won't stop y'all Uh huh, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah
