Evita Festival Disco Version
Boris Midney
Music intro

What's do Buenos Aires?, aha,
I wanna say I'm just a little stuck on you.
Hello, Buenos Aires I wanna say I'm just a little stock on you.
You'll be on me too...
And if ever I go too far
It's because of the things you are
Beautiful town, I love you
And if I need a moment's rest
Give your lover the very best
Beautiful town...
Dumba la Dumba
Dumba la Dumba
Dumba la Dumba (bis)
Beautiful town.
Turut Turut Turut
(Music break 2)
Hello
Hello
What's do Buenos Aires?, aha,
I wanna say I'm just a little stuck on you, you'll be on me too.
I'm just a little stock on you (bis 4)
I'm just a little stock on you.
(Music break 3)
It's seem crazy that you must belive,
It's nothing calculated, nothing planned
Please forgive me if I seen naif
I would never want to false your hand
But please understand I'll be good for you.
I don't always rush in like this
Twenty seconds after saying hello
Telling strangers I'm too good to miss
If I'm wrong I hope you'll tell me so
But you really should know, I'd be good for you.
Good for you,
I'd be surprisingly good for you (bis)
I'd be surprisingly good for you
I'm not talking of a hurried night
A frantic trumble then a shy goodbye
Creeping home before it gets too light
That's not the reason that I caught your eye
Which has to imply, I'd be good for you
Good for you,
Seré buena para ti,
Muy buena para ti,
I'd be surprisingly good for you (bis 2)
Seré buena para ti, yo seré buena para ti.
Buena para ti,
Good for you, I'm good for you,
Good for you I'm good for you (bis 12x)
Don't cry for me Argentina,
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance.

It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel,
That I still need your love after all that I've done,

You won't believe me,
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you.
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun, So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it too .

Don't cry for me Argentina

The truth is I never left you

All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance,
Oh oh oh

Don't cry for me Argentina

The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance.
And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions
They are not the solutions they promised to be

The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me.

Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days

My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance hey hey hey

Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance. Don't keep your distance...
Tango...

Umhh
Tango
Tango?

Tango...

(Repeated 3x to fade)
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance.
