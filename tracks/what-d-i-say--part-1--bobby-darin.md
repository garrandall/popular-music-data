You must have been a beautiful baby
You must have been a wonderful child
When you were only starting to go to kindergarten
I bet you drove the little boys wild
And when it came to winning blue ribboms
You must have shown the other kids how
I can see the judges' eyes as they handed you the prize
You must have made the cutest bow
You must've been a beautiful baby
Cause baby look at you now

Does your mother realize
The stork delivered quite a prize
The day he left you on the family tree?
Does your dad appreciate
That you're merely super great
The miracle of any century?
If they don't just send them both to me

You must have been a beautiful baby
You must have been a wonderful child
When you were only starting to go to kindergarten
I bet you drove the little boys wild
And when it came to winning blue ribboms
You must have shown the other kids how
I can see the judges' eyes as they handed you the prize
You must have made the cutest bow
You must've been a beautiful baby
Cause baby look at you now
