It just flew right by your head
Each move I made, each word I said
You've got everything all wrong
For I am right to love you so strong


What a bad misunderstanding
The trip was wild
But now we're landing

We got close but not inside
You have your youth
I have my pride

Now all's forgotten for a dime
I would explain
But why waste the time
