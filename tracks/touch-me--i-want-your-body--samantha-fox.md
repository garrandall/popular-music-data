Ah, touch me, touch me
This is the night
Touch me, touch me
I wanna feel your body


Full moon in the city and the night was young
I was hungry for love, I was hungry for fun
I was hunting you down, and I was the bait
When I saw you there, I didn't need to hesitate
This is the night, this is the night
This is the time we've got to get it right (this is the night)


Touch me, touch me I wanna feel your body
Your heartbeat next to mine (this is the night)
Touch me, touch me now


Quick as a flash you disappeared into the night
Did I hurt you boy? Didn't I treat you right?
You made me feel so good, made me feel myself
Now I'm alone and you're with somebody else
This is the night, this is the night
This is the time we've got to get it right (this is the night)


Touch me, touch me I wanna feel your body
Your heartbeat next to mine (this is the night)
Touch me, touch me now
Touch me, touch me now
Touch me, touch me now


Hot and cold emotion, confusing my brain
I could not decide, between pleasure and pain
Like a tramp in the night, I was begging for you
To treat my body like you wanted to
Oh, I was begging for you (this is the night)


Touch me, touch me I wanna feel your body
Your heartbeat next to mine (this is the night)
'Cause I want your body all the time (this is the night)
Touch me, touch me I wanna feel your body
Your heartbeat next to mine (this is the night)
'Cause I want your body all the time
Touch me, touch me, touch me (this is the night)
Touch me, touch me, I wanna feel your body
Touch me, touch me, touch me (this is the night)
Touch me, touch me, I wanna feel your body
Touch me, touch me, touch me (this is the night)
