Mmm
Mmm
Can't sleep it's so bad
You got me tossing and turning
Can't sleep I get sad
Loving you
Little things you do
You made me love you
Girl when you passed me by
You left me hypnotized
Baby baby
Can't sleep it's so bad
You got me tossing and turning
Can't sleep I get sad
Loving you
If you love me
Please tell me
So I won't feel the blues
If you love me
Please tell me
So I can go on loving you (loving you)
Loving you baby (loving you)
Said loving you (loving you)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Mmm
Mmm
Other boys you knew
Cheated and most are cruel
You'd better walk away
Misery is all it seemed
Baby baby
Can't sleep it's so bad
You got me tossing and turning
Can't sleep I get sad
Loving you
Can't sleep it's so bad
You got me tossing and turning (you got me tossing)
Can't sleep I get sad
Loving you
Can't sleep it's so bad
You got me tossing and turning (you got me turning)
Can't sleep I get sad
Loving you
'Cause I'm loving you (loving you)
Darling can't you see I'm loving you (loving you)
Loving you baby loving you baby (loving you)
Yeah I'm loving you baby (loving you)
Well you got me turning (loving you)
You got me tossing and turning yeah (loving you)
I'm loving you baby (loving you)
I'm loving you baby (loving you)
