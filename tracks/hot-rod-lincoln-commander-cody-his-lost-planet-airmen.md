My pappy said, "Son, you gonna drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that hot rod Lincoln"

Have you heard the story of the hot rod race
Where the Fords and the Lincolns were settin' the pace
That story's true I'm here to say
'Cause I was a drivin' that Model A

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up
That Model A body makes it look like a pup
It's got eight cylinders and uses them all
It's got overdrive, just won't stall

With a four barrel carb and a dual exhaust
With 4:11 gears you can really get lost
Got safety tubes, but I ain't scared
The brakes are good, the tires fair

Pulled outta San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars were shinin' bright
We was drivin' up Grapevine Hill
Passin' cars like they was standin' still

All of a sudden, in the wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by
I said boys that's the mark for me
By then the taillight was all you could see

Now the fellas ribbed me for bein' behind
So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind
Took my foot off the gas and man alive
I shoved it on down into overdrive

Wound it up to hundred and ten
My speedometer said that I'd hit top end
Had my foot glued like lead to the floor
That's all there is, and there ain't no more

Now the boys all thought that I'd lost my sense
Them telephone poles looked like a picket fence
They said, "Slow down, I see spots"
The lines on the road just looked like dots

Took a corner, sideswiped a truck
Crossed my fingers just for luck
My fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts
The guy beside me was white as a ghost

Smoke was comin' from outta the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac
Knew I could catch him; I thought I could pass
Don't ya know by then we'd be low on gas

We had flames comin' from out of the side
You could feel the tension, man what a ride
I said, "Look out boys, I got a license to fly"
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by

Now all of a sudden a she starts to knockin'
Down in the depths she started to rockin'
I looked in the mirror and a red light was blinkin'
The cops was after my hot rod Lincoln

They arrested me and they put me in jail
And they called my pappy to throw my bail
And he said, "Son, you're gonna drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that hot rod Lincoln"
