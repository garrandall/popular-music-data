U can't touch this
U can't touch this
U can't touch this
U can't touch this

My-my-my-my (U can't touch this) music hits me so hard
Makes me say,'oh my lord thank you for blessing me
With a mind to rhyme and two hyped feet'
It feels good
When you know you're down
A superdope homeboy from the Oaktown
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat-uh!
U can't touch this

I told you homeboy
U can't touch this
Yeah, that's how we livin' and you know
U can't touch this
Look in my eyes,man
U can't touch this
Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics
U can't touch this

Fresh new kicks and pants
You got it like that now you know you wanna dance
So move out of your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rolling
Hold on
Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's going on
Like that
Like that
Cold on a mission so fall on back
Let 'em know that you're too much
And this is a beat
They can't touch

Yo! I told you
U can't touch this
Why you standing there, man?
U can't touch this
Yo,sound the bells, school is in, sucker
U can't touch this
Give me a song or rhythm
Making 'em sweat
That's what I'm giving'em
Now they know
You talk about the Hammer, you're talking about a show
That's hyped and tight
Singers are sweating so pass them a wipe
Or a tape to learn
What it is going to take in the '90s
To burn the charts
Legit either work hard or you might as well quit

That's the word,because you know
U can't touch this
U can't touch this

Break it down

Stop... Hammer time

Go with the flow
It is said
That if you can't groove to this
Then you probably are dead
So wave your hands in the air
Bust a few moves, run your fingers through your hair
This is it for a winter
Dance to this an' you're gonna get thinner
Move slide your rump
Just for a minute, let's all do the bump
Bump bump bump

Yeah, U can't touch this
Look man, U can't touch this
You better get hyped
Boy 'cause you know ya can't
U can't touch this
Ring the bell, school's back in
Break it down

Stop. Hammer time

U can't touch this
U can't touch this
U can't touch this
U can't touch this
Break it down

Stop. Hammer time

Every time you see me
The Hammer's just so hyped
I'm dope on the floor
And I'm magic on the mike
Now why would I ever
Stop doing this?
When others making records
That just don't hit
I've toured around the world
From London to the Bay
It's Hammer, go Hammer, M.C.Hammer, Yo Hammer
And the rest can go and play
Can't touch this

U can't touch this
U can't touch this
U can't touch this
Yeah,U can't touch this
I told you, U can't touch this
Too hype, can't touch this
Yo, we outta here, can't touch this
