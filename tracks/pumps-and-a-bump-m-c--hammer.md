Pumps and a bump, pumps and a bump
We like the girls with the pumps and a bump!
Pumps and a bump, pumps and a bump
We like the girls with the pumps and a bump!
Pumps and a bump, pumps and a bump
We like the girls with the pumps and a bump!
Pumps and a bump, pumps and a bump
We like the girls with the pumps and a bump!


Just when I thought could I hit another one
So up jumps see me with the pumps and a bump
All stiggitty stiggity curves, getting on my good nerves
Looking like ice cream ready to be served
Stretch, bend it, can I get in it
If you wanna kick it with a G baby here's me
Cause I come equipped, I'm a pimp
Slippity slip, out your clothes and take a trip


Pumps and a bump, pumps and a bump
We like the girls with the pumps and a bump!
Pumps and a bump, pumps and a bump
We like the girls with the pumps and a bump!
Pumps and a bump, pumps and a bump
We like the girls with the pumps and a bump!
Pumps and a bump, pumps and a bump
We like the girls with the pumps and a bump!


Pumps and a bump, now many say a big butt
But if you're hip you know that it's a phone crud
It's making the brothers go crazy in the 2-G
Shake like a bottle girl fine as wine G
So when I here I got a step (to a fine thing)
Never been a coward (cause it's a eastside thing)
Just step right up to the girl with the big butt
Tell her what's up you got the pumps and a bump


Men: All that we want
For the rest of our life
Is a girl thick and tight
(Ladies!)
Women:All that we want
Is man who is right
Who can hit it all night!

We gotta bump the pumps!


Pumps and a bump, pumps and a bump
We like the girls with the pumps and a bump!
Pumps and a bump, pumps and a bump
We like the girls with the pumps and a bump!
Pumps and a bump, pumps and a bump
We like the girls with the pumps and a bump!
Pumps and a bump, pumps and a bump
We like the girls with the pumps and a bump!


I don't like 'em figgity fat! (No!)
I like 'em stiggity stacked (Yeah!)
You wiggity wiggity wack if you ain't got biggity back (Awwww!)
Now when you see the rump shaking on the dance floor
You following with your eyes and get hypnotized
But a fella like me will dance up to some chopping and chewing
Keep em bottling you know I keep 'em bobbing
I put my fingerprints all over that rump
I'm guilty as hell but I love the pumps and the bump! (Ow!)


Pumps and a bump, pumps and a bump
We like the girls with the pumps and a bump!
Pumps and a bump, pumps and a bump
We like the girls with the pumps and a bump!
Pumps and a bump, pumps and a bump
We like the girls with the pumps and a bump!
Pumps and a bump, pumps and a bump
We like the girls with the pumps and a bump!


Bring the pumps and flex the rump so I can ride


Bring the pumps, baby
Step on, baby
Bring the pumps, baby
Step on, baby
