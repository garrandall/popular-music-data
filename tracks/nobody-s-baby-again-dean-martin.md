People used to call me nobody's baby
Up until I met you
People used to call me nobody's baby
I was feeling so blue
When you came along my life was a song
I thought that my lonely would end
Then you went away and left me to stay
And I'm nobody's baby again

Nobody's baby again
I keep missing you more and more
Nobody's baby again
You're the one I've been living for

People used to call me nobody's baby
Til they saw me with you
Walking in a day dream
Hoping that maybe all my dreams would come true

I planned every move and I tried hard to prove
That even a loser can win
I don't have a knack
My lonely is back
And I'm nobody's baby again
Nobody's baby again
I keep missing you more and more
Nobody's baby again
You're the one I've been living for I planned every move and I tried hard to prove
That even a loser can win
I don't have a knack
My lonely is back
Nobody's baby
Nobody's baby
