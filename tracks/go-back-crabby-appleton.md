You don't hold me so well and it's not hard to tell
When you know in your heart that it's wrong
'Cause your thoughts are not here and you're making it clear
That the one you love is gone

I can't tell you how to live your life
No, I can't tell you what to do
But you know, yes you know
That it's true

I think you better go back, go back to your lover
Oh, go back, he's the one you really love
Go back, go back to your man
I said go back, he's the one you're thinkin' of
Go back, go back to your man
I said go back girl as fast as you can
Go back!

Now you look good to me, still I can't help but see
You've been thinking of him all the time
And you know it's not right when you kiss me tonight
You pretend his lips are mine

I can't tell you how to live your life
No, I can't tell you what to do
But you know, yes you know
That it's true

I think you better go back, go back to your lover
Oh, go back, he's the one you really love
Go back, go back to your man
I said go back, he's the one you're thinking of

Go back, go back to your man
I said go back girl as fast as you can
Go back!
Go back!
Go back, go back to your lover oh go back
Go back, go back to your man
I said go back
Go back, go back to your man
Go back girl as fast as you can
Go back!
