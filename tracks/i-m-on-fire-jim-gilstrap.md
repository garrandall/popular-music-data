Ooohooo, ooohooo)
(Ooohooo, ooohooo)
If you want a sweet, sweet love tonight
Call me and I'II make you feel alright
When you're out and running around
Playing games all over town
Turn around (Turn around), come on down (Come on down)
I'II be there, yeah, yeah!
If you want a sweet, sweet love form me
Take a chance with someone new you'LL see
I can make your fire burn with the touch or just one kiss
Turn you on (Turn you on), all night long (All night long)
You'LL be gone, gone, gone!
(Honey, now I'm on my way, I'm on fire)
There'LL be something I can't buy her
(Honey, now I'm on my way, I'm on fire)
I can feel no higher
(Honey, now I'm on my way, I'm on fire)
You keep feeding me up higher

If you want a sweet, sweet love form me
Take a chance with someone new you'LL see
I can make your fire burn with the touch or just one kiss
Turn you on (Turn you on), all night long (All night long)
You'LL be gone, gone, gone!
(Honey, now I'm on my way, I'm on fire)
Don't you know, don't you know, you're my fire
(Honey, now I'm on my way, I'm on fire)
I can feel, I can feel when you're getting higher
(Honey, now I'm on my way, I'm on fire)
Burn me, burn me, burn me
(Honey, now I'm on my way, I'm on fire)
I can feel so higher
(Honey, now I'm on my way, I'm on fire)
