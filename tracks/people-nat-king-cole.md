People, people who need people
Are the luckiest people
In the world

We're children
Needing other children
And yet letting a grownup pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like
Children than children

Lovers are very special people
They're the luckiest
People in the world

With one person
One very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half
Now you're whole

No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person
Who needs people

With one person
A very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half
Now you're whole

No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person
Who needs people

People who need people
Are the luckiest people
In the world
