Baretta's Theme (Keep Your Eye on the Sparrow)
Rhythm Heritage

Introduced by Sammy Davis, Jr. in the 1975 television show "Baretta."
Best-selling records by Sammy Davis, Jr. in 1976, Merry Clayton in 1975,
And Rhythm Heritage in 1976.

Don't go to bed with no price on your head,
Don't do it.
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.

(Chorus)
Keep your eye on the sparrow,
When the going gets narrow.

Don't roll the dice if you can't pay the price,
Don't do it.
Don't run your feet down a dead-end street.

(Repeat Chorus)

Don't do me dirt or you're gonna get hurt
Don't do it.
Don't run away till you hear what I say.

(Repeat Chorus)

Ain't gonna fight with no thief in the night
Won't do it.
I'm gonna go where the cold wind don't blow.

(Repeat Chorus)

From: "Montcomags"
