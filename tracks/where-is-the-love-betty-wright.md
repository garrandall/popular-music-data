Where is the love, where is the love you promised me
Where is the love, where is the love you promised me

You said I could have all your loving
And this I wanted it you'd give it to me
Now when it's down to the real needing feeling
You're hiding that love from me

Where is the love, where is the love you promised me (got to know)
Where is the love, where is the love you promised me

You said I'd be the only one
That you'd be giving your sweet love to
But somebody must be getting your love
'Cause loving me you just don't do, no, no

Where is the love, where is the love you promised me (you know I need it babe)
Where is the love, where is the love you promised me

I'm waiting on your love now baby, where is your love?
I'm hurting for your love now baby, where is your love?

Babe, babe, baby, baby, baby, baby, how where is the love?

Where is the love, where is the love you promised me (I gotta know)
Where is the love, where is the love you promised me

Don't tell me you back on your promising baby, I gotta have it, you know I need it
You know I want it, I gotta have it baby...

Where is the love, gotta know... where is the love...

Where is the love you said was mine, I gotta know now, I gotta know now, I gotta know
