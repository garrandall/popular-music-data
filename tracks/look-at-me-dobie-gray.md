Come on and look (look), look (look), look at me
And tell me what (what) what you see
I said look (look) look (look) look at me
And tell me what (what) what you see
You see a broken heart. My baby's about to set me free

I got tears (tears) tears (tears) tears in my eye
And I got pain (pain) pain in my heart
Oh tears (tears) tears (tears) tears in my eye
And I got pain (pain) pain in my heart

You see a broken heart. My baby's about to set me free

You see a broken heart. His baby's about to set me free (she's gonna set him free)

Come on and look (look), look (look), look at me
And tell me what (what) what you see
I said look (look) look (look) look at me
And tell me what (what) what you see
You see a broken heart. My baby's about to set me free (she's gonna set him free)

I got tears (tears) tears (tears) tears in my eye
And I got pain (pain) pain in my heart
Yeah tears (tears) tears (tears) tears in my eye
And I got pain (pain) pain in my heart

You see a broken heart. My baby's about to set me free (she's gonna set him free)

I said look (look) look (look) look at me
And tell me what (what) what you see
