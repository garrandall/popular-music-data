Ladies and gentlemen (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
The most beautiful girl in the world pageant (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Brought to you by (Yeah) (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Frankie J (Yeah) (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Chamillionaire) and Mannie F-f-f-f-fresh
(Hold up, let's go)


My swagger's like a dagger
I want it, I can have her
I pop up and I grab her like abracadabra
Body's picture perfect like she's shaking it for my camera
She introduce Frankie while he moving forward and catch her


Everybody knows when I step in the club (club)
Girls see me and they wanna show me love (love)
I got my chain on, with my shades on
Rocking designer shoes and I sold a million
So many girls, but there's one that caught my eye (eye)
Pretty lady so fine she blew my mind
Oh why
'Cause she's the one for me


I've been around the world
And seen so many girls
But none can compare
'Cause I can't keep my eyes of that girl
she got a grill and a face like a supermodel
And a body built just like a Coke bottle
But none can compare
'Cause I can't keep my eyes of that girl
Shake it Snap
Shake it bring it back
But none can compare
'Cause I can't keep my eyes of that girl


I think she knows that I'm tryna get at her
I'mma go ahead and try to put in words
What's your name, what's your number, can I hit you up?
If you digging what I'm saying
Let me know what's up
So baby let me know if I can take you home (take you home)
I just wanna be somewhere where we're alone, alone
'Cause you're the one for me


I've been around the world (around the world)
And seen so many girls (so many girls)
But none can compare
'Cause I can't keep my eyes of that girl
she got a grill and a face like a supermodel
And a body built just like a coke bottle
But none can compare
'Cause I can't keep my eyes of that girl (none can compare, she's that girl)
Shake it Snap
Shake it bring it back
But none can compare
'Cause I can't keep my eyes of that girl


Welcome to Miami
I've seen so many mammies
over seas, the girls I've seen
But none compare to you baby
I've been around the world and back
And never seen a girl like that
Now it's clear to me that you're that girl for me


And then she looks at me
And then she says "if I ever had breakfast in bed"
Then I say "I'd rather have breakfast in Brazil instead"
Then she says "Stop playing, why you're messing with my head?"
Then I say "I'm not playing, I got a jet and we can check it"

yes I had you tryna find an energizer battery
Keep gone, she know she'll be sweating, loosing calories
You can be the best "B" I bet you couldn't handle me
With money on the bed and I can prove it on my salary


she got a grill and a face like a supermodel
And a body built just like a coke bottle
But none can compare
'Cause I can't keep my eyes of that girl
Shake it Snap
Come on, come on, come on, come on baby
Shake it bring it back
Come on, come on, come on, come on you're so sexy
But none can compare
'Cause I can't keep my eyes of that girl
Shake it Snap
The way your body moves
Shake it bring it back
I love your sexy attitude
But none can compare
'Cause I can't keep my eyes of that girl


That girl

That girl
Shawty you're some exiting to look at
