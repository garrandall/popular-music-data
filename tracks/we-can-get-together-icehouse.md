There must be something we can talk about
And maybe there's something here that we can do
No matter what your friends say, don't go too far
Remember there's just one thing
Whenever you come this way
You know I wouldn't get you down
I just like talking to you

It's raining outside
I shake my shoes, downstairs
You never stop dancing
You don't make much sense
No matter what your friends say
Don't go too far
Remember there's just one thing
Whenever you come this way

Maybe we can get together
We can get together
You know I wouldn't get you down
I just like talking to you
Maybe we can get together
We can get together
Later sometime
You can buckle my shoes
You can pick up my sticks
You can knock on my door

There must be something we can talk about
Maybe there's something here we can do
Don't go back home, babe
Don't go too far
Remember there's just one thing
Whenever you come this way

Maybe we can get together
We can get together
You know I wouldn't get you down
I just like talking to you
Maybe we can get together
We can get together
Later sometime
You can buckle my shoes
You can pick up my sticks
You can knock on my door
You know I walk in the rain
I said it rains in my heart
You ought to be in my shoes
Won't you open that door
We can get together
We can get together
Baby, we can get together
We can get together
Later sometime
You can buckle my shoes
You can pick up my sticks
Why don't you open that door
