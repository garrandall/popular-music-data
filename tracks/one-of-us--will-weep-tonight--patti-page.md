Two men have quarreled, so two men will fight
Oh, stop them before it's too late
Lord, stop them from doing this terrible thing
For the sake of two women who wait.

Or one of us will weep tonight,
One of won't sleep tonight,
One of us will walk forth tomorrow,
Out of a happy life,
Into a lonely life,
Wearing the black dress of sorrow

Out is the street now they reach for their guns,
Please stop them before it's too late
But a bullet rings out and the pain can be felt
In the hearts of two women that wait.

Now one of us will weep tonight,
One of us won't sleep tonight,
One of us will walk forth tomorrow,
One of us a happy life
One of us a lonely life
Wearing the black dress of sorrow.
