One kiss is a dangerous drug
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love

It's the question of the hour
How can I be sure
Of what I don't know
She comes to me with
A poison in her flower
She steals the miracle of life
Right out of my hand

And she takes the
Part of a woman
Most hard to comprehend
And she multiplies by ten

One kiss is a dangerous drug
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love
One look and she
Shot me in cold blood
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love

It's the boundary I desire
There is always room enough to feel
Miles and miles of hilly road ahead
And she's got one hand on my heart
And one hand on the wheel

And she moves me one step
Closer to the deeper end
I may never love again

One kiss is a dangerous drug
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love
One look and she
Shot me in cold blood
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love

One by one
I take the bitter pills
They're hard to swallow
I go round and round, my head
Is spinning out of control

I will know tomorrow
If I care to live or
Face another day of sorrow
Holding onto happy ever after

One kiss is a dangerous drug
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love
One look and she
Shot me in cold blood
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love
