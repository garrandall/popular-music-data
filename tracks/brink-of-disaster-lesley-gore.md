I'm your conscience, listen to me
Don't give in, 'cause it's a conspiracy
I cannot help myself
I just can't stay away from him
If you went back it wouldn't last
How come you won't learn from your past mistakes?
My heart keeps saying yes
But you say to say no to him
I'm sorry I must go to him again

'Cause my heart has played the game before
My head says nevermore
I should know what is right for me
And I know I've lost before I start
But tell that to my heart
It's so hard for me to think
When my heart is on the brink
Of disaster

Pardon me, I must interrupt
You admit that he's not your cup of tea
It doesn't matter 'cause 
When my heart is involved, 
All my problems can't be solved
By what's right

'Cause my heart has played the game before
My head says nevermore
I should know what is right for me
And I know I've lost before I start
But tell that to my heart
It's so hard for me to think
When my heart is on the brink
Of disaster
