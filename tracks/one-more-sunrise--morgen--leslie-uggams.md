(One more sunrise)

One more sunrise
One more day to get through
One more sunrise
One more day without you
And false lips that I knew could never be true

One more (one more) sunrise (sunrise)
Now the heartaches begin
Wond'rin' (wond'rin') wand'rin' (wand'rin')
Through the places we've been
Hopin' that I can keep my sunny-side grin

Though our love is dead and gone
In my heart it still lives on and on
Feel like some poor dyin' swan
Tired of flyin', tryin', day by day I'm dyin'

One more sunrise
One more day we're apart
One more sunrise
One more daybreak for a breakin' heart

One more sunrise
One more daybreak for a breakin' heart
