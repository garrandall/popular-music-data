Bristol twisting Annie
Lay your twisting down
Bristol twisting Annie
Lay your twisting down

She's got a shape like
Ow, Rin Tin Tin
And a face like
My Uncle Ben

When it comes to the
Twist or doing the bop
Everybody calls her
The queen of the hop

Bristol twisting Annie
Lay your twisting down
Bristol twisting Annie
Lay your twisting down

She's got hips
Like big bad John
Legs like short sad Sam

When she starts doing the twist
My knees start knocking
And the whole joint's rocking

The kids all come from
Oh, yeah, miles around
Just to see what
She's putting down

When she's twisting
Everybody digs
The guys and gals
All flip their lids

Bristol twisting Annie
Lay your twisting down
Bristol twisting Annie
Lay your twisting down

Bristol twisting Annie
Lay your twisting down

She's got hips
Like big bad John
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Legs like short sad Sam

When she starts doing the twist
My knees start knocking
And the whole joint's rocking

The kids all come
From miles around
Oh, just to see
What she's putting down

When she's twisting
Everybody digs
The guys and gals
All flip their lids

Bristol twisting Annie
Lay your twisting down
One more time
Bristol twisting Annie
Lay your twisting down

Over again
Bristol twisting Annie
Lay your twisting down...
