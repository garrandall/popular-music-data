Oooh baby I like it raw
Yeah baby I like it rawww (with your MC at the epicenter)
Oooh baby I like it raw (sup boo?  sup?  sup baby?)

Oooh baby I like it raw (it's E-40 man)
Yeah baby I like it rawww (sup baby?)
Oooh baby I like it raw (I see y'all, I see you whassup y'all)
Yeah baby I like it raww (sup?? SUP???)

Shimmy shimmy ya shimmy yeah shimmy yay
Gimme the mic so I can take it away
Off on a natural charge, bon voyage
Yeah from the home of the Dodger, Brooklyn squad
WU-TANG!  Killa beez on the swarm
Reign on your college-aXX disco dorm
For you to even touch my skill
You gotta go the one killa bee and he ain't for the kill



I'm givin you that funky funky aXX-sXXX
(That sXXX) that you gotsa ta fXXX wit
So stand back cause I don't hope my funk
threw a bunk on your silly billy aXX and you too soft
I'm givin that brain a little tickle
I'm thicker than a buXX-lickin indo popsicle (popsicle)
Fool you know I'm too cold
I leave that ass hangin, hangin like a bXXXX on hold
can suck my DING, you bring like static
I shoots like a fXXXXn automatic (automatic)
Classy --- I'm in em
I'm deadly like a m--n snake's, venom
So it's on bad cuz these zaggin come around your block
and we strapped with the Mac
And you get served like a clucker
E four oh and the Eiht, down with that dirty moXXXXXXer
Geyeah



The nigga that discovered electricity
Yo gimee some of that Hurricane SO!



Cookin y'all on the burner inside a Rolex
Clocked, to a fat ass nXXXa clad in black, honk!
Might act my color but now E four oh ain't no dummy though
Might not know how to read and write but I do know how to count money hoe
NXXXa this game ain't wrinkled, hoe I don't need no starsight
to serious aXX nXXXa twenty-first of March
Time's up in this b--h right, East West whoride
BXXXXes don't understand my isht that we be servin

Uhhhh, I'm from the Bed-Stuy, now do or die
I got somethin for your a-- now I'm passin lye
See E-40 Click roll thick like a hoe drippin --
The A-von, isht



Oooh baby I like it raw
Yeah baby I like it rawww
Oooh baby I like it raw
Yeah baby I like it rawww
Oooh baby I like it raw
Yeah baby I like it rawww
Oooh baby I like it raw
Yeah baby I like it rawww



Most MC's get all too hyped
From the tent we'll rhyme and take you out with a tank
It's not MC just an MC bee
Weak on your words you never thought of by freein
positive thoughts that I let come out
Ask the God A-SON I know what it's about
On the mic I'm a leader, school I was a reader
When it come to f--n I'm a strong good breeder
MC max and we worn out wax
Collect the cash money, without ever being taxed
and then I, got your attention
I'd like to mention, DON'T BATTLE ME at any rap convention

Yo I'd like to give a shout out
to all you live zaggin out there
And also like to give a shout out
to all you punk -- out there
I wanna give a shout out
to all the true black women, because I love you
And I also wanna give a shout out
To them fake a-- b-- s out there
YaknowhatI'msayin?
