Heard a promise in the wind
Then I saw you walkin' in
Tell me, baby, where ya been so long
Waited all my life to feel this strong

I love you like I never loved before
And every day I love you so much more
I'm feeling like I've never felt so sure
Love you like I never loved before

Lonely days and lonely nights
Finally gone and out of sight (thanks to you)
I'll do everything within my power
To make your life get sweeter hour by hour

I love you like I never loved before
And every day I love you so much more
I'm feeling like I've never felt so sure
Love you like I never loved before

I'll do everything within my power
To make your life get sweeter hour by hour

I love you like I never loved before
And every day I love you so much more
I'm feeling like I've never felt so sure
Love you like I never loved before

I love you like I never loved before
(No, I never) No, I never (never loved before)
I love you like I never loved before
(No, I never) No, I never, never loved like this before
I love you like I never loved before
(No, I never) No, I never, no, I never
I love you like I never loved before
