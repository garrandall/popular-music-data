We the motherfucking best nigga
Ace Hood
Super, Future

I come looking for you with Haitians
I stay smoking on good Jamaican
I fuck bitches from different races
You get money they started hating
Turn up

I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti


OK, niggas be hating I'm rich as a bitch
One hundred K I spent that on my wrist
Two hundred dollars spent that on your bitch
Do me a model put that on my list
Oh there he go in that foreign again
Killing the scene bring the coroner in
Murder she wrote, swallow or choke
Hit her and go home, I won't call her again
Woke up early morning, crib as big as a college
Smoke me a pound of the loudest
Whipping some shit with no mileage
Diamonds cost me a fortune
Them horses all in them Porsches
You pussies can't hardly afford it
Forty two hundred my mortgage
Balling on niggas like Kobe
Fuck all you haters you bore me
Only the real get a piece of the plate
Repping my city I'm running my state
Give me a pistol then run with the Ks
Niggas want beef then I visit your place
Bang

I come looking for you with Haitians
I stay smoking on good Jamaican
I fuck bitches from different races
You get money they started hating
Turn up

I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti

Yeah, and I'm at it again
There go the flow bringing tragedy in
Copped me a chain your salary spent
Niggas is sweet bring them cavities in
Counting money, hourly trend
Rolling them skinny like Olsen twins
Niggas is squares, cabin and pens
Neck full of Gold Olympian shit
Neimans, I'm blowing the check on they gear
Fall on some pussy then hop on the Lear
Strapped with them choppers back of the rear
Sak pase them killers is here
Woke up early this morning, mind is telling me money
Paper, mula, pockets is fat as a tumor
Millionaire nigga no rumor
Living my life off of tuna
Wanted with me I deliver the beef
Real niggas only enjoying the feast
Pull up a seat, bon appetite
No Louboutins put that red on your sneaks bang

I come looking for you with Haitians
I stay smoking on good Jamaican
I fuck bitches from different races
You get money they started hating
Turn up

I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti


Photographs of dope boys
Is all they taking is finger prints on the Rolls Royce
Is why they hating push a button on these broke boys
It's detonation, walk a road to riches bare feet
I watch mama struggle now she living carefree
That's why I hustle for the half a key that's 12 Gs
I'm tryna bubble every summer a new LP
You gotta love me I got shooters out the D-League
Signin' bonus hit that man that's from thirty feet
Left in a puddle finger prints is on a hundred mill
And what it is? Ricky Rozay and Ace Hood
We hella Trill

I come looking for you with Haitians
I stay smoking on good Jamaican
I fuck bitches from different races
You get money they started hating
Turn up

I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
