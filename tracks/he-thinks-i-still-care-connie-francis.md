He thinks I still care

Just because I asked a friend about him
Just because I spoke his name somewhere
Just because I rang him number
By mistake today
He thinks I still care

Just because I haunt the same old places
Where the mem'rys of him lingers everywhere
Just because I'm not the happy girl
I used to be
He thinks I still care

But if he's happy thinking
I still need him
Then let that silly notion bring him cheer
Oh how could he ever
Be so foolish
Tell me where do you he get's such an idea

And just because I asked a friend about him
And just because I spoke his name somewhere
Just because I saw him then with all to peaces
He thinks I still care
He thinks I still care
