(Johnny loves her)
(Johnny loves her)

Johnny loves me
He just told me so last night (Johnny loves her)
Now, each star I see belongs to me
And they're all shining twice as bright (Johnny loves her)

Johnny loves me
Johnny's heart is really mine (Johnny loves her)
Love is everywhere and I could swear
The world's a great big valentine

I feel so pretty
I'm all aglow
When he says I'm wonderful
He makes me feel it's so (Johnny loves her)

Yes, Johnny loves me
Now, each day is bright and new (Johnny loves her)
And I only pray that I can say
For every day my whole life through
"Johnny loves me and I love my Johnny, too"

(Johnny, Johnny loves me)
Now, each day is bright and new (Johnny loves her)
And I only pray that I can say
For every day my whole life through
"Johnny loves me and I love my Johnny, too"

Johnny loves me (Johnny loves her, Johnny loves her)
Johnny loves me (Johnny loves her, Johnny loves her)
Johnny loves me (Johnny loves her, Johnny loves her)
Johnny loves me (Johnny loves her, Johnny loves her)
Johnny loves me
