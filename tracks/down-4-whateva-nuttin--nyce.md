Straight west coast flava
Um, 1994
Nuttin' Nyce is in the house
Bring it to me!
Hotel Motel
Holiday Inn

Whateva you want
I got it
Whateva you need
I got it

Reach in my backpack
And pick you out a condom
Ain`t got no love
For those who won't wear them
Really
No so

All I wanna know is do you want me?
(Someone to play with)
Down 4 whateva
Be it night or day
(Someone to play with)

Tell me what you need
And I'll make it happen
(Someone to play with)
Whateva it is
I'll be there right away
(Someone to play with)

Set it off with the strip
Up to Strawberry Hill
Then hit the chronic
You know I feel so by.i.onic
Damn it!
And I exhale you like to get deep
So deep
Now you meet the freak of the week, so

All I wanna know is do you want me?
(Someone to play with)
Down 4 whateva
Be it night or day
(Someone to play with)

Tell me what you need
And I'll make it happen
(Someone to play with)
Whateva it is
I'll be there right away
(Someone to play with)

Oh! It`s a shame what you do to me
Let me see you work it babe
A 68
Drive me craze
I just wanna satisfy ya

Lay back
Let me ride you, boy
You know where I go
When ya do what ya doin' to me so

All I wanna know is do you want me?
(Someone to play with)
Down 4 whateva
Be it night or day
(Someone to play with)

Tell me what you need
And I'll make it happen
(Someone to play with)
Whateva it is
I'll be there right away
(Someone to play with)

I heard you wanna come and play
Not a day you could have it your way
Freak show at the door
Here we go
Nuttin' Nyce
Thrown down at the rodeo show
