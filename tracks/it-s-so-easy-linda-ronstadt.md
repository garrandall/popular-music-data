It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love

People tell me love's for fools
Here I go, breaking all the rules
It seems so easy
Yeah, so doggone easy
Oh, it seems so easy
Yeah, where you're concerned
My heart can learn
Oh-oh-oh

It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love

Look into your heart and see
What your love book has set aside for me

It seems so easy
Yeah, so doggone easy
Oh, it seems so easy
Yeah, where you're concerned
My heart can learn
Oh-oh-oh

It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love

It seems so easy
Oh, so doggone easy
Yeah, it seems so easy
Oh, where you're concerned
My heart can learn

It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love (Wa-uh-oh)
It's so easy to fall in love
