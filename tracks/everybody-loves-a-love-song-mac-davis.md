Sometimes it makes me dizzy
Just like cherry wine
Sometimes it makes me tremble
Just to hold your body next to mine

Baby, it's a love song that I'm singing
Girl, there's nothing else I'd rather do
Cause everybody loves a love song
Baby, I love you (baby, I love you)
You know I do

Na na na na...

Baby, brush your lips against me
And whisper soft and low
Honey, tell me that you want me
Lord, it moves me, girl
I think you know

Baby, it's a love song that I'm singing
And there's nothing else I'd rather do
Cause everybody loves a love song
Baby, I love you (baby, I love you)
You know I do

(Everybody loves a love song)
(Everybody loves a love song)
