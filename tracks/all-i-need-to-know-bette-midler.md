Look at my face. I know the years are showin'.
Look at my life. Still don't know where it's goin'.
I don't know much, but I know I love you,
and that may be all I need to know.

Look at these eyes. Oh, they never see what matters.
And look at these dreams, so beaten and so battered.
I don't know much, but I know I love you,
and that may be all I need to know.

So many questions and still no answers.
I climb and climb but never get the view.
But when I hold you near me sometimes I feel so clearly
the only truth I'll ever know is me and you.

In my heart I long for inspiration.
And in my soul I know someday I'll find salvation.
I don't know much, but I know I love you,
and that may be all I need to know.

In my heart you're my inspiration.
And in my soul I know love is our salvation.
I don't kow much, but if I know you love me,
that will be all I need to know.
I don't know much, but if you say you love me,
that will be all I need to know.
