Tip my hat to the sun in the west
Feel the beat right in my chest
At the crossroads, a second time
Make the devil change his mind

It's a pound of flesh, but it's really a ton
99 problems but a bitch ain't one
If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one

Like broken glass under my feet
I could lose my mind in this heat
Looking for the prize but I don't want blood
I order one drink then I drink the flood

Well, you can come inside but your friends can't come
99 Problems but a bitch ain't one
If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one, 99 problems but a bitch ain't one

Said I tip my hat to the sun in the west
Feel the beat right in my chest
At the crossroads, a second time
Make the devil change his mind

It's a pound of flesh, but it's really a ton
99 problems but a bitch ain't one
If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one

99, 99 problems but a bitch ain't one, yeah, 99, 99, problems
But a bitch ain't one, I said 99, 99, 99, 99, I said 99, I said 99
If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, soon
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
