Holding on
Is very hard to do when love is gone
And that's no lie
Holding on
Is very hard to do when love is gone
Hey, hey, hey, yeah


I betcha you’re unhappy
I know you gotta be (I know you gotta be)
‘Cause it can drive you outcha mind
There ain’t no sense in crying
It's time for you to leave (Time for you to leave)
And baby that’s the bottom line
Oh, I betcha lie awake nights, and never rest a bit
And wish it all would disappear
But still the bottom line is you got to deal with it
And to yourself at least be fair


Holding on
Is very hard to do when love is gone
And that's no lie
Holding on
Is very hard to do when love is gone
Hey, hey, hey, yeah


Ha, ha, ha, who are you kidding?
Do do do do do
Ha, ha, ha, who are you kidding?
Do do do do do
Ha, ha, ha, who are you kidding?
Do do do do do
Ha, ha, ha, who are you kidding?


Holding on
Is very hard to do when love is gone
And that's no lie
Holding on
Is very hard to do when love is gone
Hey, hey, hey, yeah

I betcha you’re unhappy
I know you gotta be (I know you gotta be)
‘Cause it can drive you outcha mind
There ain't no sense in crying
It’s time for you to leave (Time for you to leave)
And baby that’s the bottom line
Oh, I betcha lie awake at nights, and never rest a bit
And wish it all would disappear (Hey)
But still the bottom line is you got to deal with it
And to yourself at least be fair


Holding on
Is very hard to do when love is gone
And that's no lie
Holding on
Is very hard to do when love is gone
When love is gone

Holding on...when love is gone
Holding on...when love is gone


So very hard to do, so very hard to do, yeah
Oh, I said
I said, I said, hey, I said
Listen to me now
Well, you know when the feeling's gone
Then you've got to stop holding on
'Cause that makes it twice as bad
You can’t give love that you don’t have
So why drag it on and on and on
And on and on and on and on? Yeah

Holding on...when love is gone
(Yeah, yeah)
Holding on...when love is gone
(Said that holding on is so very hard to do when your love is gone)
Holding on...when love is gone
(Holding on, so very hard to do when your love is gone, yeah yeah)
Holding on...when love is gone
