Let's wake up in the afternoon
Pretend that we got nothing to do
No we don't have to go by any agenda
We can make up our own rules
I see the way you're looking at me
Baby, know I'm feeling it too
We can just light up every candle
Move from room to room


Stopping every minute just because you're in it
Wishing everyday was Sunday, you're right next to me
It's how it's supposed to be
Hanging on every touch
Baby, don't rush (No, no)
Baby, don't rush


Throw the map out the window
Taking the long way around
To a secret place where no one could find us
A little place we can call our own
Come over here and take a picture
Something we can hang on to
We can look back and try to remember
All the crazy things we're gonna do


Stopping every minute just because you're in it
Wishing everyday was Sunday, you're right next to me
It's how it's supposed to be (supposed to be)
Just hanging on every touch
Baby, don't rush
Baby, don't rush


Stopping every minute just because you're in it
Stopping every minute just because you're in it
Stopping every minute


Stopping every minute just because you're in it
Wishing everyday was Sunday, you're right next to me
It's how it's supposed to be
Stopping every minute just because you're in it
Wishing everyday was Sunday, you're right next to me
It's how it's supposed to be (supposed to be)
Just hanging on every touch
Baby, don't rush (No, no)
Baby, don't rush (Baby, don't rush)
Baby, don't rush, no
Baby, don't rush
