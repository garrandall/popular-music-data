You who are on the road
Must have a code
That you can live by
And so become yourself
Because the past
Is just a goodbye.

Teach your children well
Their father's hell
Will slowly go by 
And feed them on your dreams 
The one they picked
The one you'll know by.

Don't you ever ask them why
If they told you, you will cry
So just look at them and sigh
And know they love you.

And you, (can you hear and)
Of tender years (do you care and)
Can't know the fears (can you see we)
That your elders grew by (must be free to)
And so please help (teach your children what)
Them with your youth (you believe in)
They seek the truth (make a world that)
Before they can die (we can live in)

Teach your parents well
Their children's hell
Will slowly go by
And feed them on your dreams
The one they picked
The one you'll know by.

Don't you ever ask them why
If they told you, you will cry
So just look at them and sigh
And know they love you.
