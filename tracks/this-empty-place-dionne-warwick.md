There's an empty place beside me
When I'm walkin' down the street
That's the place where you used to walk
The place where you held my hand
Now I reach and all I touch is space
An empty, empty place

Sadness and tears, that's all you left me
They're such bad souvenirs
Of a love that once was, oh, so very great
The greatest love
Reaching all the way to the stars above

And now there's not a star left in the sky
And if you don't come back to me I'll die
Only your embrace
Can fill this empty place

If I don't fill this emptiness
I know that I'll lose my mind
Looking out and only seeing space
An empty, empty place

Oh, sadness and tears, that's all you left me
They're such bad, bad souvenirs
Of a love that once was, oh, so very great
The greatest love
Reaching all the way to the stars above

But now there's not a star left in the sky
And if you don't come back to me I'll die
Only your embrace
Can fill this empty place

Come back, come back, come back to me
Come back and fill my empty arms
I need your lovin' darling
Your lips are lovin' darling
