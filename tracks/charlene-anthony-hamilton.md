Woke up this morning, found a letter that she wrote.
She said she's tired that I'm always on the road.
Too hard to swallow being alone.
She needs someone at night that she can hold.

She must have told me a thousand times or more.
Silent cries I used to ignore.
God knows I love her.
Didn't mean to hurt her.

Baby, I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again.
I won't leave.
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and to be with you for life.
Come on, home to me, Charlene.

She knows I really love this old music thing.
Since I was a child it's been my dream.
I can support her, treat her and spoil her.
You know: buy her the finer things.

But I forgot about loving her.
Damn the money, diamonds and furs.
What about the hard day she had with the baby?
All she need is for me to love her.

Baby, I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again.
I'll be waiting.
I won't leave.
Promise I'll be here to the very end
(Said, I promise I'll be here.)
By your side
To protect you and to love you and to be with you for life.
Come on, home to me, Charlene.

Promise I can't live without her.
God knows I need her loving.
And it hurts so bad that's she gone away.
I hope and pray she'll come back one day in my life.

Baby, I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again.
I won't leave.
Promise I'll be here to the very end
(I'll be with you for life.)
By your side
To protect you and to love you and to be with you for life.
(Say I won't go nowhere.)
Come on, home to me, Charlene.

Sometimes I cry.
Charlene, if you're listening, would you call on me?
Because my heart is aching without you.
Call me. Say about me.
