I'm not calling you a liar, just don't lie to me
I'm not calling you a thief, just don't steal from me
I'm not calling you a ghost, just stop haunting me
And I love you so much, I'm gonna let you kill me

There's a ghost in my lungs and it sighs in my sleep
Wraps itself around my tongue as it softly speaks
Then it walks, then it walks with my legs
To fall, to fall, to fall at your feet

There but for the grace of God go I
And when you kiss me, I am happy enough to die

I'm not calling you a liar, just don't lie to me
And I love you so much, I'm gonna let you
I'm not calling you a thief, just don't
And I love you so much, I'm gonna let you
I'm not calling you a ghost, just stop

There's a ghost in my mouth and it talks in my sleep
Wraps itself around my tongue as it softly speaks
Then it walks, then it walks, then it walks with my legs
To fall, to fall, to fall, to fall, to fall, to fall
To fall, to fall, to fall, to fall
To fall, to fall at your feet

There but for the grace of God go I
And when you kiss me, I am happy enough
