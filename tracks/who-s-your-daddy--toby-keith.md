Oh, alright

Yeah, here you come knockin' on my door, baby
Tell me what you got on your mind
I guess those college boys all went home for the summertime

Yeah, you're lookin' right, lookin' good
Lookin' like a woman should
So why is it so hard to find
A place to lay your pretty little head down once in a while

You run on a little tough luck, baby
Don't you sweat it
Everything is waiting inside for you
You know I got it
Come and get it

Who's your daddy, who's your baby?
Who's your buddy, who's your friend?

And who's the one guy that you come runnin' to
When your love life starts tumblin'?
I got the money if you got the honey
Let's cut a deal, let's make a plan

Who's your daddy, who's your baby?
Who's your buddy, who's your man?

You might've run on a little tough luck, baby, did you?
Don't you sweat it
Everything is waiting inside for you
You know I got it
So come and get it

Who's your daddy, who's your baby?
Who's your buddy, yeah, who's your friend?

And who's the one guy that you come runnin' to
When your love life starts tumblin'?
I got the money, you got the honey
Let's cut a deal, let's make a plan

Who's your daddy, who's your baby?
Who's your buddy, who's your man?

Who's your daddy, who's your baby?
Who's your buddy, who's your man?
