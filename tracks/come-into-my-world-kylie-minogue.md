Come, come, come into my world
Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your love

Take these arms that were made for lovin'
And this heart that will beat for two
Take these eyes that were meant for watching over you
And I've been such a long time waiting
For someone I can call my own
I've been chasing the life I'm dreaming
Now I'm home

I need your love
Like night needs morning

Come, come, come into my world
Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your love

Na na na na

Take these lips that were made for kissing
And this heart that will see you through
And these hands that were made to touch and
feel you

So free your love
Hear me I'm calling

Oh won't you
Come, come, come into my world
Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your love

I need your love
Like night needs morning

Oh won't you
Come, come, come into my world
Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your love
