When my friends told me you had someone new
I didn't believe a single word was true
I told them all I had faith in you
I, I, I, I just kept on sayin'

Oh no, not my baby
Oh no, not my sweet baby
You're not like those other guys
Who lead you on and tell you lies

My mama told me when rumors spread
There's truth somewhere and I should use my head
But I didn't listen to a-what she said
I, I, I, I kept right on sayin'

Oh no, not my baby
Oh no, not my sweet baby
You're not like those other boys
Who play with hearts like they were toys

Well, you might have had a last-minute fling
But I am sure it didn't mean a thing
'Cause yesterday you gave me your ring
And now I'm glad that I kept on sayin'

Oh no, not my baby
Oh no, not my sweet baby
You're not like those other guys
Who lead you on and tell you lies

Oh no, not my baby, oh no, not my sweet baby
Oh no, not my baby, no, no, no, no, not my sweet baby
Oh no
