Don't cry no more, wipe away your tears
Don't cry no more, baby, wipe away your tears
And I know, I know that your love is real
Don't cry, don't cry, I'm begging you
Don't cry no more, baby, I'm begging you
Every tear you shed tells me that your love is true
You cried me a river, you cried me a sea
Now I believe without a doubt
That you really, really, really love me
You cried me a river, you cried me a sea
Now I believe without a doubt
That you really, really, really love me
Don't cry no more, wipe away your tears
Don't cry no more, baby, wipe away your tears
And I know, I know that your love is real
I don't want you to cry, no, I don't want you to cry
It's summertime and the living is easy
I don't want you to cry, no, please don't cry
