Take me to your place in space
I'm sick and tired of the rat race
On rocket ship no time to wait
I just want to gravitate

It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's gone
It's gone

It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's gone
It's gone

I'll take you out to see the place
Where the man and the moon have a smilin' face
Oh yeah
You don't have to wear no fancy lace
Just a funky feel and a lot of taste

It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's gone
It's gone

It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's gone
It's gone

People movin' to and fro
To a song, a band, and a lazer show
Superman, batman, blowin' all night
Playin' one on one with a meteor light

It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's gone
It's gone

It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's gone
It's gone, gone, gone

Ninth dimension, seventh plane
Our her raising solar cane
The star patrol said keep it down, keep it down, keep it down, keep it down, keep it down, keep it down, keep it down
As long as we're cool we can stay in town
As long as we're cool we can stay around

It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's gone
(In the galaxy)
It's gone
(At the galaxy)
