Can never buy you love
Nah
(You can't buy me
Money can't buy love)
Nah, can't buy you love, baby
Uh huh, never buy you love
Could never buy you love
Nah, could never buy you love


But I need new friends
I wanted to buy a Benz
A trip about the world
Yo, an oyster full of pearls
Racks of new clothes
Hah-choo, Kleenex for my nose
A Rolex full of gold
Man, anything can be sold


(Money can't buy you love)
Money can't buy you love
Can't buy you happiness
True love can bring
Oh, no, money can't buy you love
Can buy you diamond rings
But money can't buy you love

Can't buy you love, can't buy you love
Can't buy you love, can't buy you love
Ah, listen to me now
Can't buy you love, can't buy you love


A burning desire, would you be
Inside my heart
How much will it cost
Ooh, baby
To cool it off?
What do you want?
I'll write good checks to pay the price
My wealth I'd gladly sacrifice
Yeah, baby

I need sneakers for my feet
Plenty of food to eat
A Rolex full of gold
Yo, anything can be sold


(Money can't buy you love)
Money can't buy you love
Can't buy you happiness
True love can bring
Oh, no, money can't buy you love
Can buy you diamond rings
But money can't buy you love

Damn
What if I get you pearls? (No)
What about a new pocketbook? (No)
A sweater? (No)
I thought you liked it like that? (No, I like it like this)
Ohhh, ohhh (And it won't cost you anything)


I can't satisfy
My appetite
I just want you to keep lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me
Hoooo, 'cause you do it right
Please hold me tight
This ride I'll dig to pay the fare
(What kind of ride?) (Up and down, round and round)
Give extra tips, girl, I don't care
Ahhh, baby

Mo', mo', mo', muh-muh-more money, cash, checks
Toll-free phone sex
Rolex full of gold
Yo, anything can be sold


(Money can't buy you love)
Money can't buy you love
Can't buy you happiness
True love can bring
Oh, no, money can't buy you love
Can buy you diamond rings
But money can't buy you love

Can't buy you love, can't buy you love (Repeat 4X)


Listen
Dic-dic-dic-diggity-diggy-diggy-diggy
Diamonds, rubies, pearls, it didn't matter
As long as I'm spendin' dough, yo, I'm gonna have her
I thought, so I bought and I bought 'til it drained me
And then all at once, yo, it came to me
This is no game about me or you
It's about a love that may be or may not be true
'Cause what I really needed is free and sent from up above
I guess money can't buy me love
Hey


(Money can't buy you love)
Money can't buy you love
Can't buy you happiness
True love can bring
Oh, no, money can't buy you love
Can buy you diamond rings
But money can't buy you love

Can we do it again?
