Last time I saw him
He sweetly kissed my lips
Last time I saw him
He said:"I'll be back for more of this"
Last time I saw him
We were crying at the bus
I knew he hated leaving
But he had to set us up

I gave him money
I know I invested well
Mamma doesn't trust him
But he loves me I can tell

Each time the greyhound
Arrives at nine o' clock
But I don't start my crying
'Till that last man's gotten off

Last time I saw him
Last time I saw my honey
Last time I saw him
He was greyhound-bound
But I'm still waiting here
Without a fear
That bus will someday turn around

I had no letter
It's been six months, maybe better
I try forgetting him
But I love him more then ever

I have decided
I've waited long enough
If there was nothing wrong
He would return right on that bus

There must be trouble
So I'm leavin' on the double
If he can't get to me
I know he needs me desperately

Last time I saw him
Last time I saw my honey
Last time I saw him
He was looking fine
And as he waved goodbye
He said don't cry
I'm coming back, no rain or shine

Last time I saw him
Last time I saw my honey
Last time I saw him
He was greyhound-bound
And as he waved goodbye
He said don't cry
I'm coming back, no rain or shine

La de da, la da do
Do la da da, da da da

Last time I saw him
He was looking fine
And as he waved goodbye
He said don't cry
I'm coming back, no rain or shine
