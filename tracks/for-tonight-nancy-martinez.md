Another night
It's getting colder
Just when I thought that it was over
I realized that I can't be denied
Your love
It's taking me over
Many times I've tried to spend to many lies
I've forgiven you

You got your foolish pride
And you know down deep inside
I'm breaking all the rules
What else can I do?

Cause for tonight
A little love and candlelight
For tonight
A little love and candlelight
Can't we be in love for just one night?

I couldn't see that deep inside of me
I couldn't hold on any longer
Can't believe how you get to me
I know
It keeps getting stronger
Many times I've tried to tell you
All the reasons why I'm leaving you

You got your foolish pride
And you know down deep inside
I'm breaking all the rules
What else can I do?

Cause for tonight
A little love and candlelight
For tonight
A little love and candlelight
Can't we be in love for just one night?

Cause for tonight
A little love and candlelight
For tonight
A little love and candlelight
Can't we be in love for just one night?

Cause for tonight
A little love and candlelight
For tonight
A little love and candlelight
Can't we be in love for just one night?
