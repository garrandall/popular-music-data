And I am tellin' you I'm not goin'
You're best man I'll ever know
There's no way I can ever go
No no there's no way
No no no no way I'm livin' without you
I'm not livin' without you
I don't wanna be free
I'm stayin', I'm stayin'
And you, and you
You're gonna love me, yeah oh...
You're gonna love me

And I am telling you I'm not goin'
Even though the rough times are showin'
There's just no way, there's no way
We're part of the same place
We're part of the same time
We both share the same blood
We both have the same mind

And time, and time
We've had so much to share
No no no no no no way
I'm not wakin' up tomorrow morning
And findin' that there's nobody there

Darlin' there's no way
No no no no way
I'm livin' without you
I'm not livin' without you
You see there's just no way, there's no way

Tear down the mountain
Yell, scream and shout
You can say what you want
I'm not walkin' out
Stop all the rivers
Push, strike and kill
I'm not gonna leave ya
There's no way I will

And I am tellin' you I'm not goin'
You're the best man I'll ever know
There's no way I can ever, ever go
No no no no way
No no no no way I'm livin' without you
I'm not livin' without you
Not livin' without you
I don't wanna be free
I'm stayin', I'm stayin'
And you, and you, and you
You're gonna love me, yeah...
You're gonna love me, yes you are
Oh, love me, yeah!
Love me, love me, love me
Love me, love me, love me
You're gonna love me
