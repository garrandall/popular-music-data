I'm a little boy with glasses
The one they call the geek
A little girl who never smiles
'Cause I've got braces on my teeth
And I know how it feels
To cry myself to sleep
I'm that kid on every playground
Who's always chosen last
A single teenage mother
Tryin' to overcome my past
You don't have to be my friend
Is it too much to ask?


Don't laugh at me, don't call me names
Don't get your pleasure from my pain
In God's eyes, we're all the same
Someday we'll all have perfect wings
Don't laugh at me


I'm the cripple on the corner
You pass me on the street
I wouldn't be out here beggin'
If I had enough to eat
And don't think that I don't notice
That our eyes never meet
I lost my wife and little boy
Someone crossed that yellow line
The day we laid 'em in the ground
Is the day I lost my mind
Right now I'm down to holdin'
This little cardboard sign


Don't laugh at me, don't call me names
Don't get your pleasure from my pain
In God's eyes, we're all the same
Someday we'll all have perfect wings
Don't laugh at me


I'm fat, I'm thin, I'm short, I'm tall
I'm deaf, I'm blind, hey, aren't we all?


Don't laugh at me, don't call me names
Don't get your pleasure from my pain
In God's eyes, we're all the same
Someday we'll all have perfect wings
Don't laugh at me
