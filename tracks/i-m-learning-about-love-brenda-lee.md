I'm learning 'bout love
Got the book by my side
I got the moon and the stars
There to be my guide
Yes if you just walk (walk) talk (talk)
In a loving way baby
Love until the break of day

I'm learning 'bout love
Put hand your in mine
We'll learn about love
Till the end of time
Yes if you just walk (walk) talk (talk)
In a loving way baby
Love until the break of day

(Lesson one) Hold me tight
(Lesson two) Lips stay close to mine
(Lesson three) Study as you go
(Lesson four) You'll be mine

I'm learning 'bout love
Got the book by my side
I got the moon and the stars
There to be my guide
Yes if you just walk (walk) talk (talk)
In a loving way baby
Love until the break of day

(Lesson one) Hold me tight
(Lesson two) Lips stay close to mine
(Lesson three) Study as you go
(Lesson four) You'll be mine

I'm learning 'bout love
Got the book by my side
I got the moon and the stars
There to be my guide
Yes if you just walk (walk) talk (talk)
In a loving way baby
Love until the break of day

Oh give me love, love, love
Yeah love, love, love
I said love, love, love
