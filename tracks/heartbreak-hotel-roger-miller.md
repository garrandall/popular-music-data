Since my baby left me I've found new place to dwell
Stand at the end on Lonely Street at Heartbreak Hotel
Well I get so lonely baby I get so lonely I get so lonely I could die

And though it's always crowded you still can find some room
For broken hearted lovers to cry away there in the gloom
Well I get so lonely I get so lonely I get so lonely I could die

Yeah the bellhop's tears keep flowing the deskclerk's dressed in black
They've been so long on Lonely Street they ain't never gonna come back
Well I get so lonely I get so lonely I get so lonely I could die
One more since my baby left me...
