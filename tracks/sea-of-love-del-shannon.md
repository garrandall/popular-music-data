Come with me, my love
To the sea, the sea of love
I want to tell you oh how much I love you

Do you remember when we met?
That's the day I knew you were my pet
I want to tell you how much I love you

Come with me
To the sea
Of
Love

Do you remember when we met?
That's the day I knew you were my pet
I want to tell you oh how much I love you

Come with me
To the sea
Of
Love

Do you remember when we met?
That's the day I knew you were my pet
I want to tell you oh how much I love you
