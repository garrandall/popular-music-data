Where do you go when you're too young?
You found worlds that's just begun
Who's gonna save you're days too long?
Or right from wrong?, Who can lead you on?

Where do you go?
I don't know, ooh

Ask your mom, but right now she's mad
The night before she fought your dad
She'd help you out if she had the time
But your dad is sad and your mother's cryin'
