Everybody wants some
But no one wants to pay
Hey-yeah
And even though you take it when you need it
There's too much in the way
Hey-yeah
The lights go out
And the people get ready
And the music is playin' and playin'
Solid and steady

(Huh)
Love and Rock and Roll
To the bottom of your soul
Two things, two things that don't get old
Love and Rock and Roll
Love and Rock and Roll
Now I don't want desire
And before it goes away
Hey-yeah
Now I'm trying to satisfy my hunger
You know what I say
Hey-yeah
Let the lights go out
Let the people get ready (huh)
Let the music play and play
Solid and steady

(Huh)
Love and Rock and Roll
To the bottom of your soul (rock)
Two things, two things that don't get old
Love and Rock and Roll
Love and Rock and Roll

Two arms to hold me
Two arms to rock me away
Ah hey hey hey
Ah hey hey hey

Love and Rock and Roll
To the bottom of your soul (rock)
Two things, two things that don't get old boy
Love and Rock and Roll boy

Love and Rock and Roll
To the bottom of your soul
Two things, two things that don't get old
To Love and Rock and Roll boy
To Love and Rock and Roll boy
To Love and Rock and Roll boy
