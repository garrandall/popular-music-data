Merry Christmas, baby, you really did treat me nice
Merry Christmas, baby, you really did treat me nice
Bought me a hi-fi for Christmas, now I'm living in paradise
Well, I'm feelin', mighty fine, I got good music on my radio
Well, I feel so fine, I got good music on my radio
Yes, I want to hug and kiss you baby
While you're standing beneath the mistletoe

Santa came down the chimney, 'bout a half past three
Left all these pretty presents that you see before me
Merry Christmas baby, you really been good to me.

I will always love you baby
Now I'm happy as I can be
