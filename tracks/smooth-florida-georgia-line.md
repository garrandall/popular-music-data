Smooth
Like a Tennessee Walker
Just a walking on the water
You're smooth
Like a Sunday morning Elvis
Singing Gospel it's a hell of a groove
Like the lines on her Mercury
Girl you're put together perfectly
Good lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
Cause you wrote the book
There ain't nobody
A do me like you
The way you move that body
Girl, you're so smooth

Like cat daddy driving
A Caddy from Cali baby
You're smooth
Like young love buzzing
Off an Old Camp bottle by the Moon
Blackberry jam, finger-licking
Off your hand flying out the window

Good lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
Cause you wrote the book
There ain't nobody
(There ain't nobody)
A do me like you
(Do me like you)
The way you move that body
(The way you move that body)
Girl, you're so smooth
(So smooth)
Smooth, smooth

You're a stroke on the canvas
A brick road to Kansas
My little summer time jam

Good lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
Cause you wrote the book
There ain't nobody
(There ain't nobody)
A do me like you
(Do me like you)
The way you move that body
(The way you move that body)
Girl, you're so smooth
(So smooth)
Smooth, smooth
(You so smooth)
Smooth
