In the summertime when the weather is high
You can stretch right up and touch the sky
When the weather's fine
You got women, you got women on your mind
When the sun goes down
You can make it, make it good and lay by

If her daddy's rich, take her out for a meal
If her daddy's poor, just do what you feel
Speed along the lane
Do a ton or a ton and twenty-five
When the sun goes down
You can make it, make it good and lay by

We're not bad people, we're not dirty, we're not mean
We love everybody, but we do as we please
When the weather's fine
We go fishing or go swimming in the sea
We're always happy
Life's for living, yeah, that's our philosophy

Sing along with us, dee-dee dee-dee dee
Da doo da-da da, yeah, we're ha-happy
Da da da, dee da doo dee da doo da doo da
Da doo da-da da, dee da da dee da da

When the winter's here, yeah, it's party time
Bring your bottle, wear your bright clothes, it'll soon be summertime
And we'll sing again
We'll go driving or maybe we'll settle down
If she's rich, if she's nice
Bring your friends and we'll all go into town
