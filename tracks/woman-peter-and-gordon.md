If you don't want, you don't have to get into trouble
If you don't want, you don't have to get into trouble
If you don't want, you don't have to get into trouble
You just leave my woman alone

If you don't want, you don't have to get into trouble
If you don't want, you don't have to get into trouble
If you don't want, you don't have to get into trouble
You just leave my woman alone

I know you got the money
And you've got a brand new fifty-seven too
But if I ever see my little girl in your car
I'm gonna do some work on you

If you don't want, you don't have to get into trouble
If you don't want, you don't have to get into trouble
If you don't want, you don't have to get into trouble
You just leave my woman alone

I know you are a playboy
And you've got women all over town
But if I ever see you sweet-talk my little girl
I'm gonna lay your body down

If you don't want, you don't have to get into trouble
If you don't want, you don't have to get into trouble
If you don't want, you don't have to get into trouble
You just leave my woman alone
You just leave my woman alone
