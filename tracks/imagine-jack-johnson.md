Imagine there's no heaven
Its easy if you try
And no hell, below us
And above us, is only sky


Imagine all the people
Livin for today
You-ou-ou
You may say, that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday, you'll join us
And the world will live as one


Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill
Or die for
No religion too


Imagine all the people
Livin the life for peace
You-ou-ou
You may say that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday, you'll join us
And the world will live as one


Imagine no posessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man


Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
You-ou-ou
And you may say that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday, you'll join us
And the world will live as one
