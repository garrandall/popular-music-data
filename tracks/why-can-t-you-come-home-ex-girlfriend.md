Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah

Why can't you come home?
Why can't you come home?
Home, home
Why can't you come home?
Home to my love
Why can't you come home?

You're treating me like a limousine
And you driving me out of my mind, yeah
Why you wanna do that to me, baby?
You telling my friends to cause a scene
And embarassed me all the time, yeah

But what am I supposed to say
What am I supposed to do
When I love someone
I've got to be loving you, oh

You stay out every night
And that just ain't right
You must take me for a fool, yeah

Don't treat me wrong too long
Baby, I just can't not hang on
If you love me like I love you
Why can't you come home?

Why can't you come home?
Home to my love
Why can't you come home?
Home, home
Why can't you come home?
Home to my love
Why can't you come, come ho-o-o-ome?

Yo, check this out
I stay up from night to day
Hoping that you would get home, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
You stay in bed like that's OK (it's OK)
One day, you'll gonna be alone, yeah

But what am I suppose to say?
What am I suppose to do?
When there's love
But I can't find you

You stay out every night
And that just ain't right
You got me singing the blues

Don't treat me wrong too long
(Don't make me wait too long)
Baby, I just may not hang on
('Cause baby, I just may not, may not, may not hang on)
If you love me like I love you
Baby
Oh, yeah, yeah
Why can't you come home?

Why can't you come home?
Home to my love
Why can't you come home? (oh, yeah, yeah)
Home, home
Why can't you come home?
Home to my love
Why can't you come, come ho-o-o-ome?
Oh
Oh

I wash your clothes
I cook your food
But you treat me so damn cruel
Oh
Tisha X on the flex
But not vex
The only time I see you is only when you want sex

Leave me alone
If you can't come home
Or you might catch a frying pan straight to the dome
You know what I'm saying?
'Cause the E-X-Girlfriend ain't playing

Oh, yeah, yeah
Don't treat me wrong too long
(Don't treat me wrong)
Baby, I just may not hang on
(I may not hang on)
If you love me like I love you
Why you wanna do that to me, baby?

Yo, why is you got to be?
Yo, why is you got to be?
Yo-yo-yo
Why is you got to be?
Word
So damn tough?

Oh, yeah, yeah

Why can't you come home?
Home to my love
Why can't you come home?
Home, home
Why can't you come home?

Come home
You know I need your love
Come home
Come ho-o-ome
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-eah-eah
Come on, baby
Come to my-my-my-my-my-my, my love
My love, my love, my love
Oh-oh, my, my, my love, love, love
(Ho-o-o-ome)

Why... can't... you... come... home?

Why can't you come home?
Home, home
Why can't you come home?
Home to my love
Why can't you come, come ho-o-o-ome?

Why can't you come home?
(Oh, yeah, yeah)
Home to my love
Why can't you come home?
(Oh, yeah, yeah)
Home, home
Why can't you come home?
(Oh, yeah, yeah)
Home to my love
Why can't you come, come ho-o-o-ome?
