Everyday is a lifetime without you
Hard to get through, since youâve gone
So I do the only thing I know how to , to get back
Iâm living for the night

Iâve drawn all the curtains in this old house
To keep the sun out, off of my face
Friends stop by to check - in âcause Iâve checked out
I tell them Iâm fine, Iâm just living for the night

I canât hide the tears I cry, the pain that came with your goodbye
The memories that keep me out of sight
Every night I venture out, into those neon arms that hold me tight
Iâm living for the night

Iâm a whole lot easier to talk to, when Iâve had a few, settled down
Whiskey kills the man youâve turned me into
And I come alive
Iâm living for the night

I canât hide the tears I cry, the pain that came with your goodbye
The memories that keep me out of sight
Every night I venture out, into those neon arms that hold me tight
Iâm living for the night
Iâm living for the night

Everyday is a lifetime without you
