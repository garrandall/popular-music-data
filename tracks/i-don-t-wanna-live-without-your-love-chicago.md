What's up baby girl! (Ho!) 
Thought I had to talk to you again, missing you (Hey, ey, ey, ey) 
Tim is missing you Missy's missing you 
Rashad is missing you your mom is missing you (N-n-n-n-no no no) 
Your pop is missing you Dame is missing you damn we missing you...WOO!!! 


All we listen to is all the different yous 
Four page letters in addition to 
Have you ever loved somebody used to get the party poppin 
We used to party alot, we used to be in the Hampton's partied alot 
We was The Breakfast Club you was a part of the ROC 
We used to make up special names for the food we ate 
Remember cerial pie one of your favorite plates (I miss you) 
Well Dame told me tell you he's doin well 
Due to the circumstances, it could've been Bellevue 
But I ain't got to tell you, you lookin over us 
Our little angel, but you know what 


Brooklyn's missing you Detroit is missing you 
New Orleans missing you Philly's missing you 
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you) 
Your uncle's missing you your families missing you 
Your fans is missing you the galleries missing you 
Damn we missing you 
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you) 


Now Star is mad I won't grant him a interview 
Now he's dissing me cause he dissed you 
Can you believe the nerve of this dude? 
Cause of your memory I won't bring in the pistols 
But he got issues enough of that lame 
I never seen pain like your parents pain 
But I know God protecting you 
You used to read Seed Of The soul I know God perfecting you 
All the estrogen the darker texture you are the more intellectual 
You are so professional our little purple star 
Too good for earth you are (I miss you) 


Houston's missng you L.A.'s missing you 
DC's missing you Chicago's missing you 
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you) 
Kidada's missing you Shock is missing you 
Colleen is missing you Tiny is missing you 
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you) 


By the way, Big we missing you Pac we missing you 
We feel your presence just not in the physical 
All across the world, blocks is miserable 
Y'all left a void it's alot of little yous 
But they not original and they not identical 
They just studied your flows and they watched your interviews 
That's when hip hop if it's not ten of you 
Then it gotta be more, y'all left your paws 
Footprints on the game hood ain't been the same 
Feeling ain't been in music hooks ain't been the same 
But I'm doing what I can man and try to follow y'all memory lane man 
Big you be ashamed to see New York gangbang 
Pac you feel the same thing they use your name in vein 
But I guess that's the issue 
And it proves how much, niggas really miss you 


Pun we missing you Big L we missing you 
Left Eye we missing you Jay we missing you 
Jam Master Jay, Freaky Tah, Scott La Rock, the list goes on........ 
The world is missing you the hood is missing you 
(Wondering if your the same and who's been with you) 
Nah mean, miss y'all (I miss you) 
This goes, to the memory of all our fallen soldiers 
Soldiers and soldgettes all across the world (I miss you) 
We gon' hold y'all down, y'all live in our memories forever 
We never gon' let y'all go 


I, can't, breathe, no, more (We not remembering y'all death though!) 
Since you went away (We celebrating your life) 
I dont really feel like talkin, don't wanna hear you love me (Nah mean!) 
Baby (Yes!) do you understand me (Yes!) 
I can't do a thing without you (Damn we missing you) 
Wondering if your the same and who's been with you, I miss you 
Wondering if your the same and who's been with you, I miss you
