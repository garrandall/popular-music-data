Thought it wouldn't matter
If we didn't stay together
And if it was over
Maybe it was for the better
I was thinking I'd be alright
Until I thought it all through
Now I know that I ain't really living
If I have to live without you


I don't want to live without your love
I don't want to face the night alone
I could never make it through my life
If I had to make it on my own
I don't want to love nobody else
I don't want to find somebody new
I don't want to live without your love
I just want to live my life with you


Guess I had to go away
So much I had to go through
Guess I had to lose you
To realize how much I love you
Can we make the fire burn again
Burn a little stronger?
Because I've been alone and baby
I can't be alone now any longer




Oh, if I had to make it on my own
My life would never be the same
My love would never be the same
I don't want to live without your love
