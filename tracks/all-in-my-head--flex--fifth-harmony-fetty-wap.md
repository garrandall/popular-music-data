Flex, time to impress
Come and climb in my bed
Don't be shy, do your thing
It's all in my head


I wanna flex with you, baby
I'm tryna chill with you
Throwin' bands at you
While we flexing boo, baby
Show me some different moves
And I love your groove
'Cause it's meant to be, baby
Ay, make history, baby
And you the one for me
And I'm the one for you
So come flex with me, baby


Curtains like waves closing in all around us
Dimming the lights just so that they don't blind us
So tongue in cheek when we're laying on roses
But you're touching my skin and you're leaving me hopeless


I wanna feel you un—, feel you under my body
I wanna feel you un—, feel you un—


Flex, time to impress
Come and climb in my bed
Don't be shy, do your thing
It's all in my head
Flex, time to impress
Come and climb in my bed
Don't be shy, do your thing
It's all in my head, yeah


Curtains like waves closing in all around us, yeah, yeah, yeah
Dimming the lights just so that they don't blind us, nah, nah
So tongue in cheek when we're laying on roses
But you're touching my skin and you're leaving me hopeless


I wanna feel you un—, feel you under my body
I wanna feel you un—, feel you un—


Flex, time to impress
Come and climb in my bed
Don't be shy, do your thing
It's all in my head
Flex, time to impress
Come and climb in my bed
Don't be shy, do your thing
It's all in my head, yeah


I want you to come flex with me, baby
You got what I want and I need it
Say you're a bad motherfucker and I'm sayin'
They can't play with us and you know it
I take a hundred thousand and blow it
Ay, another hundred thou and I love her
Ay, come flex with Zoo 'til it's over
Ay, come flex with Zoo 'til it's over, yeah babe


I wanna feel you un—, feel you under my body
I wanna feel you un—, feel you un—


Oh, flex, time to impress
Come and climb in my bed
Don't be shy, do your thing
It's all in my head
Flex, time to impress
Come and climb in my bed
Don't be shy, do your thing
It's all in my head, yeah


(I wanna flex with you, baby) Hey, it's all in my head
(Zoovier, baby) It's all in my head
(I wanna flex with you, baby) It's all in my head
(Baby) It's all in my head
