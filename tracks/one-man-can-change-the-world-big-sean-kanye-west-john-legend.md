They used to tell me, used to tell me
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty at everything
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing
That one man could change the world
That one man could change the world

All I, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
Imagined this so much, some nights it felt like that I had it
Back on the mattress
Starin' at the ceilin' tryna connect the dots
But it's hard makin' those attachments
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day, you know?
My, my step brother used to flip them bags outside the crib like it was trash day, no Kim K, but he bagged ye ye
But when you're getting fast money, slow down, don't crash
With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas
Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it
Tell your team about it, go make million dollar schemes about it
Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance
Used to look up at the stars and be like ain't too much that's different
I be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot don't you miss it
What you know 'bout wakin' up every day like you on a mission?
And I


I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty at everything
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing
One man could change the world
One man could change the world


My grandma told me, "If you write your name in stone you'll never get the white out."
I grinded out that black hole then performed up at the White House
Standin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories then laughed
I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks
Where I'm from I swear they're broke, they need way more than the cast
We need more than what you have and then we need more than that
But how am I supposed to say I'm tired
If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions that I couldn't survive
Went to war, came back alive
On top of that became a female black captain
When being black you had to extra extra try
Way before James Brown made us proud
She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye right there on Outer Drive
And she taught me how to drive
And she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right
Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry
When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly
All my life you've been that angel in disguise sayin'


I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty at everything
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing
That one man can change the world
That one man can change the world

 Thank you for callin' me, been thinkin' about me
 It's all good I love you grandma
 Bye
