It's so cold out here
Baby, what's wrong with us?
I feel a storm comin'


When autumn first arrived
You were my lady
And love was written in the winter snow
Then with the change of month, there came October
And now I wonder where our love did go
It was the second rain of autumn
We shared our feelings
And it was such, such a glorious autumn dream, yes it was
But like kids, we were too shy to say to each other
That together we would always like to be...


Someday soon, I know we'll come together
Even though our feelings change as seasons do (yes, babe)
But maybe sweet November will tell us the story
That will bring us back the love
That we both knew


When autumn first arrived, you said you'd be my lady
And you promised me that you would never go, (ooh-hoo)
But with the change of month, there came October
And now I'm wondering where, where did our love go
It was the second rain of autumn (second rain of autumn)
We shared our feelings
And it was such, such a glorious autumn dream, yes it was
But like kids, we were too shy to say to one another
That together we would always like to be....


Someday soon, I know we'll come together
Even though our feelings change as seasons do
But maybe sweet November will tell us the story, babe
That will bring us back the love...oh-oh...

Someday soon, I know we'll come together
(I know we're gonna come together, yes we will, I know)
Even though our feelings change as seasons do
But maybe sweet November will tell us the story, baby, yeah
That will bring us back the love
That we both...

Someday, some way, hey...
