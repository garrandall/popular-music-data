Boys... Get up y'all!
Stand Up!

I woke up to the angels
Singing in my head
You look so good naked next to me
(There's) an angel in my bed

Stand Up!

I feel like a drug is cookin' in my veins
Still I'm so out of my mind
I'll shoot you up again
Stand Up! etc...


Water save my soul

Stand Up! ...

Smell like smoke and fire it's burning in us all.
You dropped me in the water
Lift me up save my soul

Stand Up!

American Baby Intro
She said
A hundred times
She said
A thousand times
Everything...
