Oh, clap your hands, clap your hands
Oh, clap your hands if you can
You've got the rhythm in your feet
Now clap your hands to get the beat
Clap your hands, clap your hands
You've danced the Bop and done the Stroll
The Conga-rock is getting old
Now clap your hands right through the dance
The beat will put you in a trance
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Now gather 'round and listen close
This is the dance that is the most
Oh, face-to-face you gotta stand
And get the big beat from the band
Clap your hands, clap your hands
You've got the beat, you're in the groove
Now grab your chick and start to move
This isn't just-a rock 'n' roll
This is a dance for young and old
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Don't go away
Let's get together once again
This is the way to make a friend
Oh, if you're ever feelin' blue
This is advice I give to you
Clap your hands, clap your hands
