They say we're young and we don't know
Won't find out until we grow
Well I don't know babe if that's true
'Cause you got me and baby I got you

Babe, I got you babe, I got you, babe

They say our love won't pay the rent
Before it's earned our money's always spent
I guess that's so, we don't have a lot
But at least I'm sure of all the things we got

Babe, I got you babe, I got you, babe

I got flowers in the spring
I got you, to wear my ring
And when I'm sad, you're a clown
And when I get scared you're always around

So let them say your hair's too long
I don't care, with you I can't go wrong
Then put your little hand in mine
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb

Babe, I got you babe, I got you, babe

I got you to hold my hand
I got you to understand
I got you to walk with me
I got you to talk with me
I got you to kiss goodnight
I got you to hold me tight
I got you and I won't let go
I got you to love me so


I got you, babe
