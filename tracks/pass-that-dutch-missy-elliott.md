Listen up, everyone!
We have been just informed that there's an unknown virus that's attacking all clubs
Symptoms have been said to be: heaving breathing, wild dancing, coughing
So when you hear the sound "who-di-whoooo!"
Run for cover, motherfucker!
Woooooo! Ah, daddy! Ooooo! Ah! oh, oh!
Pass that dutch (ah), pass that dutch (oh)
Pass that dutch (ah), pass that dutch (ah)
Pass that dutch (ah), pass that dutch (ah)
Pass that dutch (whoo), pass that dutch


Misdemeanor on the flow, pretty boy, here I come
Pumps and a bump make you wanna hurt something
I can take your man, I don't have to sex 'em
Hang 'em out the window, call me Michael Jackson (hehehee!)
I'm a pain in your rectum, I am that bitch y'all slept on
Heavy hitter, rhyme spitter, call me Re-Run
Hey, hey, hey, I'm what's happ'nin
Hpnotiq in my drink (Thatâ€™s right!)
Shake ya ass 'til it stink (That's right!)
Mr. Mos' on the beat (That's right!)
Put it down for the streets (That's right!)


(Who-di-whooooooooooooo!)
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Come on, pass the dutch, baby! (ah!)
Shake-shake shake ya stuff, ladies!
(Who-di-whooooooooooooo!)
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pop that, pop that, jiggle that fat (ah!)
Don't stop, get it 'til ya clothes get wet


Number one; drums go bump, bump, bump
This beat here will make your pum pum jump
If you's a fat one, put your clothes back on
Before you start putting pot holes in my lawn
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh
I'm under attack like my name was Saddam
I am the bomb from New York to Milan
And I can write a song sicker than Jeffrey Dahm'
(Woop woop!) Don't touch my car alarm
Break in my car, you will hear "Viper Armed"
I've been a superstar since Daddy Kane was raw
I'm live on stage, c'mon and give me some applause
"Thank you! Oh, thank you, you all are so wonderful!"


(Who-di-whooooooooooooo!)
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Come on, pass the dutch, baby! (ah!)
Shake-shake shake ya stuff, ladies!
(Who-di-whooooooooooooo!)
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pop that, pop that, jiggle that fat (ah!)
Don't stop, get it 'til ya clothes get wet


Listen up, motherfuckers
You have five seconds to catch your breath
Five, four, three, two, one


Pop that, pop that, make that money
Just keep it going like the Energizer Bunny
Shake that, shake that, move it all around
Spank that, yank that, dutch back now
Freak him, freak her, whatever your choice
Didn't come to judge, I came to get ya moist
Scream "Who-di-whooooooo!", now my voice is lost
Can I get a ride on the white horse?


(Who-di-whooooooooooooo!)
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Come on, pass the dutch, baby! (ah!)
Shake-shake shake ya stuff, ladies!
(Who-di-whooooooooooooo!)
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pass that dutch, pass that dutch
Pop that, pop that, jiggle that fat (ah!)
Don't stop, get it 'til ya clothes get wet


Pop that
Pass that dutch, baby!
Jiggle that fat
