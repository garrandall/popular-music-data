He came ridin' in on the sunrise of a hot west Texas day
A fancy man in a painted wagon with some fancy things to say
Looks like you folks need some water, well water is my game
And for the small price of $100 I betcha I can make it rain

Step back non believers or the rain will never come
Somebody start that fire a-burning somebody beat the drum
You know some may think I'm crazy for making all these claims
But I swear before this day is over you folks are gonna see some rain

They all just stood there a-staring trying to believe
But there was one named Lizzie Cooper who said he was a lying cheat
You say you call yourself a rainman, well you oughta be ashamed
Starting all these people dreamin', thinking you can make it rain

Step back non believers or the rain will never come
Somebody keep that fire a-burning somebody beat the drum
You know some may think I'm crazy for making all these claims
But I swear before this day is over you folks are going see some rain

Hey Lizzie, well a mans got to have a dream
And if you can't walk on the inside with me, I'll meet you in between
Oh come with me Lizzie and the stars will right your name
And if you still think I'm lying to you, look younder there comes the rain

Step back non believers for the rain will never come
Somebody keep that fire a-burning somebody beat the drum
You know some folks think I'm crazy for making all these claims
But I swear before this day is over you folks are going see some rain
