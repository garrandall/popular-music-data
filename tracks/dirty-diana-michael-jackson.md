Oh No ... .
Oh No ... .
Oh No ... .


You'll Never Make Me Stay
So Take Your Weight Off Of Me
I Know Your Every Move
So Won't You Just Let Me Be
I've Been Here Times Before
But I Was Too Blind To See
That You Seduce Every Man
This Time You Won't Seduce Me


Angella That's Ok
Call Police If You Want
Mi Nah Have Nuttn Fi Dem
Cah Mi A No Outlaw
A Nuh Mi Mek You Life
Look Like It Nah Go No Way
A Through You Bite Too Much
Obeah Mek You Brokeee Yeaah


Dirty Diana, Nah
Dirty Diana, Nah


Dutty Angella (oh oh)
Dutty Angella (oh oh)


Mi Born A Night
But Mi Nuh Born Last Night
A Red Eye You Red Eye
Mek You Gih Mi A Fight
As Mi Real Choppin
Police Come Same Time
And A Search Up Every Vehicle
With Some Bright Flash Light


She Likes The Boys In The Band
She Knows When They Come To Town
Every Musician's Fan After
The Curtain Comes Down
She Waits At Backstage Doors
For Those Who Have Prestige
Who Promise Fortune And Fame,
A Life That's So Carefree
She's Saying That's Ok
Hey Baby Do What You Want
I'll Be Your Night Lovin' Thing
I'll Be The Freak You Can Taunt
And I Don't Care What You Say
I Want To Go Too Far
I'll Be Your Everything
If You Make Me A Star


Dirty Diana, Nah
Dirty Diana, Nah
Dirty Diana, No
Dirty Diana ... .


She Gone A Obeah Man
Fi Try Tek Weh Mi Life
She Seh A Mi She Hate
She Mi Wussa No Like
She Use To Beg Mi Mi Things
She A Real Parasite
Now She Siddung Pon Mi Fucking Name Day And Night

Angella That's Ok
Call Police If You Want
Mi Nah Have Nuttn Fi Dem
Cah Mi A No Outlaw
A Nuh Mi Mek You Life
Look Like It Nah Go No Way
A Through You Bite Too Much
Obeah Mek You Brokeee Yeaah


Dutty Angella (oh oh)
Dutty Angella (oh oh)
Dutty Angella (oh oh)
Dutty Angella (oh oh)


She Said I Have To Go Home
'Cause I'm Real Tired You See
But I Hate Sleepin' Alone
Why Don't You Come With Me
I Said My Baby's At Home
She's Probably Worried Tonight
I Didn't Call On The Phone
To Say That I'm Alright

Diana Walked Up To Me,
She Said I'm All Yours Tonight
At That I Ran To The Phone
Sayin' Baby I'm Alright
I Said But Unlock The Door,
Because I Forgot The Key,
She Said He's Not Coming Back
Because He's Sleeping With Me


Dirty Diana, Nah
Dirty Diana, Nah
Dirty Diana, Nah
Dirty Diana, No
Dirty Diana, Nah
Dirty Diana, Nah
Dirty Diana, Nah
Dirty Diana ... .
Come On!
Come On!
Come On!
Come On!...
