Sometimes, yes sometimes
I wish I were a boy

I've been standing by the jukebox
Hoping he'd ask me to dance
How I wish I could run to him and hug him
But a girl musn't make an advance

Oh oh oh oh I'm a girl and it's wonderful
It fills my heart with joy

But sometimes, yes sometimes
I wish I were a boy

Oh he's dancing with another
And he's holding her so tight
Wish I had nerve to cut right in and stop it
But a girl has to be polite

Oh oh oh oh I'm a girl and it's wonderful
It fills my heart with joy
But sometimes, yes sometimes
I wish I were a boy

Now the record hop is over
And I think he caught my eye
Here he comes heading straight in my direction
There he goes, he's passing me by

Oh oh oh oh I'm a girl and it's wonderful
It fills my heart with joy
But sometimes, yes sometimes
I wish I were a boy
Sometimes, yes sometimes
I wish I were a boy
