Sitting in the morning sun
I'll be sitting till the evening come
Watching the ship roll in
And I'll watch em roll away again, yeah

(I'm sitting on the dock of the bay)
Watching the tide (tide roll away)
Ooh, Lord, sitting on the dock of the bay
Wasting time, time

I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the Frisco Bay
I have nothing to live for
Seems like nothing's
Gonna come my way

Let me hear you say
(I'm sitting on the dock of the bay)
Watching the tide (tide roll away)
Ooh, Lord, sitting on the dock of the bay
And I'm just wasting time

Look like nothing's gonna change
Everything remains the same
I can't do what ten people
Wants me to do now
So I guess I'll remain the same

Hey, sitting here resting my bones
Cause this loneliness won't leave me alone
Two thousand miles I roam
Just to make this dock my home

Let me hear you all say now
(Sitting on the dock of the bay)
Watching the tide (tide roll away)
Ooh, Lordy, Lord, now
Sitting on the dock of the bay
And I'm wasting time, ooh
