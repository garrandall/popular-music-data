I don't remember the moment I tried to forget
I lost myself, is it better not said
Now I'm closer to the edge

It was a thousand to one and a million to two
Time to go down in flames and I'm taking you
Closer to the edge


No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day maybe we'll meet again
No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day maybe we'll meet again
No, no, no, no


(Can you, can you, can you, can you)
Can you imagine a time when the truth ran free?
The birth of a sun, the death of a dream
Closer to the edge

This never ending story
Paid for with pride and faith
We all fall short of glory
Lost in our fate


No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day maybe we'll meet again
No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day maybe we'll meet again
No, no, no, no


I will never forget
I will never regret
I will live my life

I will never forget
I will never regret
I will live my life


No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day maybe we'll meet again
No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day maybe we'll meet again
No, no, no, no


Closer to the edge
Closer to the edge
(No, no, no, no)
Closer to the edge
Closer to the edge
(No, no, no, no)
Closer to the edge
