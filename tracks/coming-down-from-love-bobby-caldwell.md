From the beginning
You were my life
And through the seasons
I made the sacrifice
Now I remember
What you did to me before
It keeps bringing me down

And the relation
Tore me apart
You were so clever
Girl it broke my heart
Now I remember
Cause I can't forget the past
It keeps spinning around

Darling somehow
Now that you're gone
I have no one
I write you letters
And throw them away
Only a fool keeps hanging on
When love slips away

Coming down from love
And I wonder why it takes so long
Cause I keep holding on
Coming down from love
And I wonder why it takes so long
Tell me where I went wrong

Through all the changes
Love was so blind
But I continued
Keeping an open mind
Now I remember
Cause I can't forget the past
I keep spinning around
