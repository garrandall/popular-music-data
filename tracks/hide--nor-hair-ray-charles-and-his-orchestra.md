Ohh, I was lying in the bed with fever
And I was burning up inside
My baby walked in my bedroom
And I could hardly open my eyes
She said that she was going to the pawnshop
Just across the track
She started packing some clothes in a hurry
And then she said she would be right back


But I haven't seen hide 'nor hair of my baby since that day, yeah
Well I haven't seen hide 'nor hair of my baby since she went away
I remember so well when she slammed the door
But the girl didn't make it back no more
I ain't seen hide 'nor hair of my baby since that day


Well, I waited for twenty four hours and I was just about to starve to death
It didn't look like she was coming back, so I had to look out for myself
Well, I called the police department to find out what they knew
They said, "No, by heck, but we will get her yet"
Because they was looking for her too




Well, I called my Dr. Foster and when the girl answered the phone
I got a funny feeling, the way she said 'Dr. Foster had gone'
She said, "He left with a lady patient, about twenty four hours ago"
I added two and two and here's what I got
I got I'll never see that girl no more
