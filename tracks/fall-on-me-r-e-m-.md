There's the problem, feathers, iron
Bargain buildings, weights and pulleys
Feathers hit the ground
Before the weight can leave the air


Buy the sky and sell the sky
And tell the sky, and tell the sky


Don't fall on me (What is it up in the air for?)
Fall on me (If it's there for long)
Fall on me (It's over, it's over me)


There's the progress
We have found a way to talk around the problem
Building towers
Foresight isn't anything at all


Buy the sky and sell the sky
And bleed the sky and tell the sky


Don't fall on me (What is it up in the air for?)
Fall on me (If it's there for long)
Fall on me (It's over, it's over me)
Fall on me


Well, I would keep it above
But then it wouldn't be sky anymore
So, if I send it to you
You've got to promise to keep it home


Buy the sky and sell the sky
And lift your arms up to the sky
And ask the sky and ask the sky


Don't fall on me (What is it up in the air for?) (It’s gonna fall)
Fall on me (If it's there for long) (It’s gonna fall)
Fall on me (It's over, it's over me) (It’s gonna fall)
Don't fall on me (What is it up in the air for?) (It’s gonna fall)
Fall on me (If it's there for long) (It’s gonna fall)
Fall on me (It's over, it's over me) (It’s gonna fall)
Fall on me
Don't fall on me (What is it up in the air for?) (It’s gonna fall)
Fall on me (If it's there for long) (It’s gonna fall)
Fall on me (It's over, it's over me) (It’s gonna fall)
Fall on me
