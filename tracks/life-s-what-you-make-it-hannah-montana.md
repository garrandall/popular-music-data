Put your hands together everybody!
Aiaiaaaaaaaaaaaaa...
Yeah!
Don't let no small frustration
Ever bring you down (no, no, no, no)

Just take a situation
And turn it all around
Yeah!
With a new attitude everything can change

Make it how you want it to be
Staying mad, why do that, give yourself a break
Laugh about it and you'll see! (Come on!)
Life's what you make it

So let's make it rock (Make it rock!)
Life's what you make it
So come on (Come on!), come on, (everybody now)!
Aiaiaaaaaaaaaaaaa...

(You can do better of that, oh yeah!)
(Don't stop!)
Why be sad, broken-hearted
There's so much to do (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Life's is hard, or it's party (It's party!)
The choice is up to you!
With a new attitude everything can change
Make it how you want it to be

Staying sad, why do that, give yourself a break
I know you wanna party with me (Woow!)

Life's what you make it
So let's make it rock
Life's what you make it
So come on (Come on!), come on, (everybody now)!

Let's celebrate it
Join in everyone
You decide (You decide!)
Cause life's (Cause life's!)
What you make it (Oh yeah!)

Things are looking up
Anytime you want
All you gotta do is realize that
It's under your control

So let the good times rock and roll! (Auu!)
(Come on everybody!)
D-d-d-do it now!
Ah!
Alright! (Let's get the party started!)
Yeah! yeah! yeah!
(Now thats the party!)
Yeah! yeah!
(Put your hands together!)
Life's what you make it
So let's make it rock (Let's make it rock)
Life's what you make it
So come on (Come on!), come on, (everybody now)!
Let's celebrate it
Join in everyone
You decide (You decide!)
Cause life's (Cause life's)
What you make it
(Oh, yeah!)
Life is what you make it!
