In the Spring of my life, she came to me
She brought sunshine where winter winds had blown
Then I took her for my wife, in the spring of my life
And she brought me a joy I never known

And the years, they went by in the spring of my life
And in summer, she blessed me with a child
Love continued to grow, in the summer of my life
And in every morning sun I saw her smile

But in the autumn of my years, I noticed the tears
And I knew our life was in the past
Though I tried to pretend, I knew it was the end
For the autumn of my life had come at last

Now what, what do you say to a child of ten?
How do you tell him his daddy's going away?
Do I tell him that I reached the autumn of my life
And that he'll understand some winter's day?

Now the rose can't be found on a snow covered ground
And the Sun can not shine through cloudy skies
But I'm richer you see for the years she gave to me
And I'm content in the autumn of my life
