With these hands, I will cling to you,
I'm yours forever and a day.
With these hands, I will bring to you,
A tender love as warm as May.
With this heart I will sing to you,
Long after stars have lost their glow,

And with these hands, I'll provide for you,
Should there be a stormy sea,
I'll turn the tide for you,
And I'll never,
No, I'll never let you go.
