Tell her you care each time you speak
Make it her birthday each day of the week
Bring her nice things, sugar and spice things
Roses and lollipops and lollipops and roses

One day she'll smile, next day she'll cry
Minute to minute you'll never know why
Coax her, pet her, better yet, get her
Roses and lollipops and lollipops and roses

We try acting grown up but as a rule
We're all little children fresh from school
So carry her books that's how it starts
Fourteen or forty they're kids in their hearts

Keep them handy, flowers and candy
Roses and lollipops and lolipops and roses

So carry her books that's how it starts
Fourteen or forty they're kids in their hearts
Keep them handy, flowers and candy
Roses and lollipops and lolipops and roses
