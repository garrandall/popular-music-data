These are the facts of love
These are the facts of love

You've heard about my reputation
You might think that I'm as cold as ice
If you know a secret, I'm not so hard to satisfy
I'll accept no invitations
Men who play the game with foolish lies
There found a dozen
I've got something else in mind
I need more than empty conversation
Only takes me half away

These are the facts of love
Don't waste my time with temporally passion
These are the facts of love
I need more than ordinary satisfaction

I don't want another halfway lover
I've played the game so many times before
I'll open up my heart and love was walking out my door
I need more than empty conversation
Only takes me half away

These are the facts of love
Don't waste my time with temporally passion
These are the facts of love
I need more than ordinary satisfaction
These are the facts of love
Don't waste my time oh baby
I need more than temporally passion
These are the facts of love
I've played the game so many times before

I need more than empty conversation
Only takes me half away

More than temporally passion
I need more than empty love

These are the facts of love
No imitation love
These are the facts of love
I need more, I need more
Than just to have my love
These are the facts of love
Every time I open up my heart
Love on sight I'll be
These are the facts of love
