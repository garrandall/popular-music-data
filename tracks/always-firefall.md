How've you been, say it's me again
It's been a long long time
There's so much to say, where do I begin?
I'll sit down and sing you a line
I'm hoping everything is fine

You've got me thinking of you, always
Every day, every night
And when I'm thinking of you, always
I want you more than life

Time is seasoned with endless love
Memories never fade
All the distance makes it hard to live
But I dream about us everyday
Oh, and missing you, I've just got to say

You've got me thinking of you, always
Every day, every night
And when I'm thinking of you, always
I want you more than life

I see your face in the night when I'm dreaming
I touch your smile far away
Girl without you my life is empty
But I'm hanging on
Sending all my love (sending all my love)

You've got me thinking of you, always
Every day, every night
And when I'm thinking of you, always
I want you more than life

You've got me thinking of you, always
Every day, every night
And when I'm thinking of you, always
I want you more than life

You've got me thinking of you, always
Every day, every night
And when I'm thinking of you, always
I want you more than life

You've got me thinking of you, always
Every day, every night
And when I'm thinking of you, always
I want you more than life

You've got me thinking of you, always
