Never gonna give you up
No matter how you treat me
Never gonna give you up
So don't you think of leavin'


Girl, you treat me bad and I know why
Yeah, I've seen you runnin' around with another guy
And you think if you hurt me that I'll go away
Made it up in my mind that I'm here to stay
So tell him


(Never gonna give you up)
Whisper in his ear
(No matter how you treat me)
(Never gonna give you up)
You tell him that Jerry said he'll never let you go
(So don't you think of leavin')


Hey, don't you understand
What you're doing to the man?


Do you see these tears here in my eyes?
Ain't no use in me lyin' 'cause I really cried
You think you're gonna take me and put me on the shelf
Girl, I'd rather die than see you with somebody else


So throw it out of your mind
(Never gonna give you up)
I'll never leave you
(No matter how you treat me)
Though you grieve me and deceive me, mama yeah
(Never gonna give you up)
(So don't you think of leavin')


Hey, don't you understand
What you're doing to the man?


My friends all say that I'm your fool
And you're using me like a carpenter uses a tool
And I know their intentions are all very good
Some of them would help me if they could


(Never gonna give you up)
But I'll never, never, never, never, never let you go baby
(No matter how you treat me)
(Never gonna give you up) No matter what you say
(So don't you think of leavin')


Babe, don't you understand
That you're killing this man?


(Never gonna give you up)
Never gonna give you up
(No matter how you treat me)
No matter what you do to me, baby now
(Never gonna give you up)
(So don't you think of leavin')
One of these days I'll be standin' around your door
(No matter how you treat me)...
