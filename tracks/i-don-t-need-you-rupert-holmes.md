I don't need you
I don't need you half as much
As you need me
And I thank my lucky stars
That you have freed me

'Cause I'm losing weight at last
Losing weight and losing sleep
And losing my mind fast

I don't need you
I don't miss you in the way
I expected
I have time to clean the sink
And feel neglected

Will I call you up? I won't
I forgot your number 6364831

And I don't need you
I don't need you like my life depended on it
You're gone, you're gone, you're gone
It only affects me in the hours
When I need you, I need you

But I don't want you
I do crosswords
And I'm weaving a basket
And I'd never take you back
Unless you ask it

I don't need you
I don't need you like my life depended on it
You're gone, you're gone, you're gone
It only affects me in the hours
When I need you, I need you

But I don't love you
I don't love you like
With whom you are living
Only twenty times as much
And all's forgiven

If you'd come by today
So that I can have you near forever while I say
That I don't need you, I don't need you
I don't need you

I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you

Need you
Need you
Need you
