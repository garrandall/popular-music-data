Got the news on Friday morning
But a tear I couldn't find
You showed me how I am supposed to live
Now you showed me how to die
I was lost til Sunday morning
I woke up to face my fear
While writing you this good bye song I found a tear

I'm going to miss that smile
I'm going to miss you my friend
Even though it hurts the way it ended up
Id do it all again

So play it sweet in heaven 
Cause that's right where you want to be
I'm not cryin' cause I feel so sorry for you
I am cryin' for me

I got up and dialed your number
Your voice came on the line
That old familiar message
I have heard a thousand times
It just said, sorry that I missed you
Leave a message and god bless
I know that you think I am crazy
But I just had to hear your voice I guess

I'm going to miss that smile
I'm going to miss you my friend
Even though it hurts the way it ended up
Id do it all again

So play it sweet in heaven 
Cause that's right where you want to be
I'm not cryin' cause I feel so sorry for you
I am cryin' for me

Oh

So play your upsidedown, left handed
Backward bass guitar
I'll see you on the other side superstar

I'm going to miss that smile
I'm going to miss you my friend
Even though it hurts the way it ended up
I'd do it all again

So play it sweet in heaven 
Cause that's right where you want to be
I'm not cryin' cause I feel so sorry for you
I am cryin' for me

I'm still cryin'
I'm cryin' for me
Oh
I'm still cryin'
