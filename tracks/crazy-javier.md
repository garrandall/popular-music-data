Hm...hey yea hey...hoooooowhooo...baby,


Kind of like a summer's breeze,
you do exactly as you please,
drop a brother to his knees just for fun.
I think it was the first of May,
girl I can't forget the day,
right then and there I knew you were the one.
Do you think that possibly,
you could spend your life with me,
cause girl this love is growing, and it's hotter than the sun.


I get a little bit crazy baby,
everytime you call my name
my heart beats a little bit faster,
after, you are in my arms again.
Can't try to fight it,
won't even try to hide it,
emotions falling down like the rain,
I can't find the words to explain it,
ain't it, crazy how I fall,
everytime you call my name.


It's kind of like a work of art,
you shot an arrow through my heart,
even though we're worlds apart I can't deny,
it feels like your apart
of me the finish and the start of me,
girl you are the heart of me,
and that's no lie,
did I mention that I love you so,
and I just want the world to know,
if I could you know I would write your name across the sky.



Crazy, crazy...
Evertime that your close to me,
I lose control of my sanity,
everynight, everyday, every word and you say,
girl do you know you put a spell on me.



Crazy,
Everytime you call my name,
I don't know what to do,
I'm so in love with you.
