Ohlook at her standing there
Tight dress and long dark hair
Oh it's good to know
That she's waitin' for me

I always said I'm a one night man
Tease the little girls and away I ran
But her eyes burned a hole in my heart
I don't know what to say

When I saw her I was fascinated
I never even hesitated
When I touched her I went right up in smoke
When I kissed her I was blistered and it's time I spoke

I got to sing it, shout it
Tell the world about it
I can't believe what I'm thinking of
Sing it, shout it
Tell the world about it
I think I'm falling in love

Ohshe looks so good tonight
There's something special about the light
Oh she seems to glow
Like the moon on the sea
I know I'm late for our rendezvous
But I just wanna look for a minute or two
I may never have much in this life
But at least I'll have a memory

'Cause she moves with such a sweet precision
Her arms can hold me like a prison
Her lips are all I need to survive
So she blitz's me with kisses just to keep me alive

-CHORUS-

She moves with such a sweet precision
Her arms can hold me like a prison
Her lips are all I need to survive
So she blitz's me with kisses just to keep me alive

-CHORUS 3X-
