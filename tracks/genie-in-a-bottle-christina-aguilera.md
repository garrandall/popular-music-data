I feel like I've been locked in tight
For a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone to release me

You're thinking you're in
Blowing kisses my way
But that don't mean
I'm gonna hear what you say
Baby, baby

My mind is saying, "Let's go"
But my heart is saying, "No"

If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta ask me the right way
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression
I've gotta like what you do

I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Gotta catch me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out

The music's fading and the light's down low
Just one more dance and then we're good to go
Waiting for someone who gets me

Mind is racing at the speed of light
Let's go and have a little fun tonight
Baby, baby

My mind is saying, "Let's go"
But my heart is saying, "No"

If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta ask me the right way
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
Just come and set me free, baby
And I'll be with you

I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Gotta catch me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out

I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Gotta catch me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out

My mind is saying, "Let's go"
But my heart is saying, "No"

If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta ask me the right way
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
Just come and set me free, baby
And I'll be with you

I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Gotta catch me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out

I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Gotta catch me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out

I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
