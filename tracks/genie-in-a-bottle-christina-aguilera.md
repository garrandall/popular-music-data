Come on, come on
Uh, yeah
Come on, come on, uh


I feel like I've been locked up tight for a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone to release me
You're lickin' your lips and blowing kisses my way
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
Baby, baby, baby (Baby, baby, baby)


Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(My body's sayin' "Let's go")
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(But my heart is sayin' "No, no")


If you wanna be with me, baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle (In a bottle, baby)
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me, I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression (Oh yeah), I gotta like what you do


I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
You gotta rub me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out


The music's banging and the lights down low
Just one more dance and then we're good to go
Waiting for someone who needs me
Hormones racin' at the speed of light
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight
Baby, baby, baby (Baby, baby, baby)


Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(My body's sayin' "Let's go")
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Mmm)
(But my heart is sayin', but my heart is sayin' "No, no")


If you wanna be with me, baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle (I'm a genie in a bottle, oh yeah)
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me (Oh), I can make your wish come true
Just come and set me free, baby, and I'll be with you


I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
You gotta rub me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Gotta rub me the right way, honey
(If you wanna be with me, be with me, be with me)
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out


Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(My body's sayin' "Let's go")
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(But my heart is sayin' "No, no")


If you wanna be with me, baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle (I'm a genie in a bottle)
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me, I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression, gotta like what you do
(Oh, yeah, yeah)
If you wanna be with me, baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle, you gotta rub me the right way
(In a bottle, baby)
If you wanna be with me, I can make your wish come true
Just come and set me free, baby, and I'll be with you


I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out
