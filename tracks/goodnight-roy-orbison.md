My Lovely woman child 
I found you out running wild with someone new 
You've been untrue, And everybody knows we're through 

But I can't say goodbye to you, No matter what you do 
My heart won't let you go, Although I know you go 
With someone new, I think of you 

I think of how you kiss, Your tenderness 
With all of this, I miss the way you say goodnight 

Bittersweet, your kisses, When my heart still misses 
The way that things used to be, But I know you're strong for 
Other arms you long for, And you can never come back to me 

Not just for yesterday, tonight or tomorrow 
Ah, but forever 
I'll hear you say goodnight, goodnight 
Goodnight turned out to be a lie 
And I can't help it if I cry 
Goodnight my love, Sleep tight my love 
Goodnight
