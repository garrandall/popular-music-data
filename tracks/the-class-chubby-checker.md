Yeah school is out
And the weekend's here
(Hey hey the weekend's here)
Wait for the bell
Never thought it would ring yeah
(Hey hey the weekend's here)
Well now you're out
Out on the street
The sound of the music's
Gonna ring in your feet
Come on everybody
The weekend's here
(Hey hey the weekend's here)
Put aside your books
Your pencils, your erasers
(Hey hey the weekend's here)
The music's got a beat
It's gonna send ya
(Hey hey the weekend's here)
(The singer's really hip)
(The record's a groove)

Gonna make you wanna move
Come on everybody
The weekend's here
(The week)
The week's so long
Never thought it would pass
Exams are all over
Couldn't wait to get out of class
So I could dance
So I could dance
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
It's Friday night
And thing's are goin' strong yeah
(Hey hey the weekend's here)
(Sounds like thunder)
Sweepin' cross the floor yeah
(Hey hey the weekend's here)
Saturday night another great dance
Come on baby let's a take a chance
Come on everybody
The weekend's here
(Hey hey the weekend's here)
Come on everybody
The weekend's here
(Hey hey the weekend's here)
Come on everybody
The weekend's here
(Hey hey the weekend's here)
Hey Hey
