I MADE A RESOLUTION
AND A PLAN TO DO MY WORK
BUT I NEED YOU TO MAKE IT WORK
YOU`VE GOT TO READ THE MESSAGE
UNDERSTAND WHAT`S ON MY MIND
CAUSE NOT TO SEE WOULD BE A CRIME
AND WE COULD LOOSE IT ANYTIME


WE`VE GOT TO SHOW SOME RESPECT
WE`VE GOT TO LEARN TO PROTECT
DON`T TAKE IT FOR GRANTED I KNOW
THAT IF YOU WANT TO STAY CLOSE
WE`VE GOT TO SHOW SOME RESPECT

BUT I BELIEVE IN WORKING
THEN I BELIEVE IN A LITTLE HELP
CAUSE I`M NOT LIGHT UNTO MYSELF
WITHOUT A THING OF VALUE
WHY SETTLE FOR SECOND BEST
WE DON`T KNOW WHAT`S UP AHEAD
WE CAN`T LET OURSELVES FORGET



FOR THE THINGS THAT I LOVE ABOUT YOU
FROM THE WOMAN THAT YOU SEE INSIDE
DON`T LET IT WALK OUT THE DOOR
LOVE FOLLOWS EVERY TIME
