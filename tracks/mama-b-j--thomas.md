Who's the one who tied you shoe when you were young
And knew just when to come and see what you had done
Mama oh mama
And whos the one who patched your eye and told you not to cry
Cause he was to big for you to try
Mama mama

And whos the one you didn't need to plead
To give her time to the little leauge
It was mama oh mama
And whos the one who gave her shoulder
When you told her your first love was over
She'd met someone older mama mama

It was mama, my mama, mama, oh mama

Whos the one who taught you obligation then dedication
Results graduation mama mama
And whos the one whos shown the friends you've known
A home away from home whem they were tired and all alone
Mama mama

And whos the one who held a tear inside
When you introduced you future bride
And whos the one that didn't mean to cry
As you walked down the isle through tears you saw her
Smile
Mama oh mama
Mama my mama
It was mama my mama
