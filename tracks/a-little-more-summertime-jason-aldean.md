They're boarding up this water town
Ain't nobody hanging 'round
Another gray September day
Was I crazy to think she'd stay

If that sun would've just hung up in that sky just a little bit yeah just a little bit longer
If those blue water waves could've stayed at her feet on the beach 'stead of going out with the tide
If that wind was a friend it'd still be blowing in like a warm southern whisper on her
She might have stayed forever and never ever left these arms if only I
Had a little more summertime

I brace myself against the cold
Let her memory take hold
Stirring that old fire up
As if I don't miss her enough

If that sun would've just hung up in that sky just a little bit yeah just a little bit longer
If those blue water waves could've stayed at her feet on the beach 'stead of going out with the tide
If that wind was a friend it'd still be blowing in like a warm southern whisper on her
She might have stayed forever and never ever left these arms if only I
Had a little more summertime

Just a little more summertime

If that sun would've just hung up in that sky just a little bit yeah just a little bit longer
She might have stayed forever and never ever left these arms if only I
Had a little more summertime
