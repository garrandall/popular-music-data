(You're the reason I don't sleep at night)
I just lay here at night
Toss and I turn
Loving you so
How my heart yearns
You're the reason I don't sleep at night (don't sleep at night)
Walkin' the floor
Feelin' so blue
Smoke cigarettes
Drink coffee too
Honey, you're the reason I don't sleep at night (don't sleep at night)
I'm bettin' you're not losin' sleep over me
But if I'm wrong, don't fail to call
Come over and keep me company (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Sometimes I go for a walk
Take a look at the moon
Strum my guitar
Sing a love tune
A- honey, you're the reason I don't sleep at night (don't sleep at night)
Walkin' the floor
Feelin' so blue
Smoke cigarettes
Drink coffee too
Strum my guitar
Look at the moon
Losin' sleep over you
I'm bettin' you're not losin' sleep over me
But if I'm wrong, don't fail to call
Come over and keep me company (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Sometimes I go for a walk
Take a look at the moon
Strum my guitar
Sing a love tune
A- honey, you're the reason I don't sleep at night (don't sleep at night)
Walkin' the floor
Feelin' so blue
Smoke cigarettes
Drink coffee too
Strum my guitar
Look at the moon
Losin' sleep over you
You're the reason
You're the reason
You're the reason
I don't sleep at night
