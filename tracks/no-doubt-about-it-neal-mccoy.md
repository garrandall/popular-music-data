Just like every lock's got to have a key
Every river flows looking for the sea
And when you plant a seed, it reaches for the sky
That's just the way it is, nobody wonders why
Like coffee needs a cup you know that it ain't much good without it
We were meant to be together, no doubt about it
Like a hammer and a nail, socks and shoes
We go hand in hand, like a rhythm and blues
What good is a man who hasn't got a dream
Bout as good as a car with no gasoline
You're the one I'm dreaming of got to have your love can't live without it
We were meant to be together, no doubt about it

No there ain't no doubt about it
Something was missing it was making me blue
But all I ever needed was you

Just like every lock's got to have a key
Every river flows lookin' for the sea
And when you plant a seed, it reaches for the sky
That's just the way it is, girl with you and I
Like coffee needs a cup you know that it ain't much good without it
We were meant to be together, no doubt about it
No there ain't no doubt about it

Like a hammer and a nail, socks and shoes
We go hand in hand, like a rhythm and blues
What good is a man who hasn't got a dream
'Bout as good as a car with no gasoline
You're the one I'm dreaming of got to have your love can't live without it
We were meant to be together, no doubt about it
