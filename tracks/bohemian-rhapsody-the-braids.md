Mama, just killed a man,
Put a gun against his head,
Pulled my trigger now he's dead
Mama life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

Mama, ooooh
I ddn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Oh carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late,
My time has come,
Send shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody
I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

Mama, oooh
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I never been born at all

(Oh oh carry on nothing really matters) I didn't mean to make you cry
If i'm not back again this time tomorrow
(Carry on, carry on, as if nothin really matters)

I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I never been born at all,
(Carry on, nothing really matters)

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh, baby
Can't do this baby
Just gotta get right out of here

Oh, baby
Can't do this baby

Just gotta get right out of here

Oh oh carry on nothing really matters
I sometimes wish I never been born at all

(Ooh carry on, nothing really matters)

Nothing really matters
Anyone can feel

Nothing really matters to me
Anyway the wind blows
