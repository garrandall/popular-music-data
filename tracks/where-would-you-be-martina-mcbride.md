I wonder where your heart is
Cause it sure don't feel like it's here
Sometimes I think you wish
That I would just disappear
Have I got it all wrong
Have you felt this way long
Are you already gone

Do you feel lonely
When you're here by my side
Does the sound of freedom
Echo in your mind
Do you wish you were by yourself
Or that I was someone else
Anyone else


Where would you be
If you weren't here with me
Where would you go
If you were single and free
Who would you love
Would it be me
Where would you be

I don't wanna hold you back
No, I don't wanna slow you down
I don't wanna make you feel
Like you are tied up and bound
Cause that's not what love's about
If there's no chance we can work it out
Tell me now
Oh tell me tell me now



Have I become the enemy
Is it hard to be yourself
In my company



Oh tell me tell me now
Where would you be
Where would you go
Who would you love
Would it be me?
