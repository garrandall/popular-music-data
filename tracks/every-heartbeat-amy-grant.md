Hear me speak what's on my mind
Let me give this testimony
To reaffirm that you will find
That you are my one and only
No exception to this rule
I'm simple but I'm no fool
I've got a witness happy to say
Every hour, every day

Every heartbeat bears your name
Loud and clear they stake my claim
My red blood runs true blue
And every heartbeat belongs to you

Classic case of boy meets girl
Moving in the same direction
You're not asking for the world
I'm not asking for perfection
Just a love that's well designed
For passing the test of time
I'm here to tell you
I'm here to stay
Every hour, every day

Every heartbeat bears your name
Loud and clear they stake my claim
Ask anyone and they'll tell you it's true
Every heartbeat belongs to you

Every heartbeat bears your name
Loud and clear they stake my claim
My red blood runs true blue
And every heartbeat belongs to you

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, sure maybe I'm on the edge
But I love you baby and like I said
I'm here to tell you
I'm here to stay
Every hour, every day

Every heartbeat bears your name
Loud and clear they stake my claim
Ask anyone and they'll tell you it's true
Every heartbeat belongs to you

Every heartbeat bears your name
Loud and clear they stake my claim, yeah
My red blood runs true blue
And every heartbeat belongs to you

Every heartbeat bears your name
Loud and clear they stake my claim
And every heartbeat belongs to you

Every heartbeat bears your name
Loud and clear they stake my claim
Ask anyone and they'll tell you it's true
Every heartbeat belongs to you
