Everybody likes a celebration
Happy music and conversation
I'd be lying if I said
I never got the blues

So pardon me for my disposition
You see, I just can't keep
From wishing that I
Was celebrating too

I know (I know)
This night (this night)
Won't last forever
I know (I know)
The sun's (the sun)
Got to shine sometime
I got (I got)
Some hope (some hope)
For a bright tomorrow
I know (I know)
This heart (this heart)
Gonna mend just fine

In the corner there's a couple dancing
From the kitchen I can hear 'em laughing
They're playing the same old songs on the radio
I wish I didn't have to sit and listen
And be reminded of what I'm missing
No I'd rather feel lonesome all alone

I know (I know)
This night (this night)
Won't last forever
I know (I know)
The sun's (the sun)
Got to shine sometime
I got (I got)
Some hope (some hope)
For a bright tomorrow
I know (I know)
This heart (this heart)
Gonna mend just fine

Suddenly, a strange vibration
From my head to my toes
Filling me with a warm sensation
Somebody's letting me know, yeah
It isn't right to be so downhearted
Telling me that the party started
And I (I) got some celebrating to do
Hey, now

I know (I know)
This night (this night)
Won't last
Can't last forever
I know (I know)
The sun's (the sun)
Got to shine sometime
Now I got (I got)
Some hope (some hope)
For a bright
Such a bright tomorrow
I know (I know)
This heart (this heart)
Gonna mend just fine
Now I know (I know)
This night (this night)
Won't last, can't last
I know (I know)...
