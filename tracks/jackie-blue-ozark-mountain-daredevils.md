Oh-hoo, Jackie blue
Lives her life from inside of a room
Hides that smile when she's wearin' a frown
Oh Jackie, you're not so down

You like your life in a free-form style
You'll take an inch but you'd love a mile
There never seems to be quite enough
Floating around to fill your lovin' cup

Oh-hoo, Jackie blue
What's a game, girl, if you never lose
Ask a winner and you'll prob'bly find
Oh Jackie, they've lost at sometime

Don't try to tell me that you're not aware
Of what you're doing and that you don't care
You say it's easy, just a nat'ral thing
Like playing music but you never sing

Oh-hoo, Jackie blue
Making wishes that never come true
Going places that you've never been
Oh Jackie, you're going again

{guitar solo}

Oh-hoo, Jackie blue
Lives a dream that can never come true
Making love is like siftin' through sand
Oh Jackie, it slips through your hand

Every day, in your indigo eyes
I watch the sun set but I don't see it rise
Moonlight and stars in your strawberry wine
You'd take the world but you won't take the time

Oh-hoo, Jackie blue
Lives her life from inside of a room
Makes you think that her life is a drag
Oh Jackie, what fun you have had

Oh Jackie, oh Jackie

Oh Jackie, oh Jackie, oh Jackie

Hey, hey, hey, hey

{guitar solo}
