I walk along those city streets
You used to walk along with me
And every step I take recalls
How much in love we used to be

How can I forget you
When there is always something there to remind me?
Always something there to remind me
I was born to love you
And I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me
Whoa-oo-oh-oh

If you should find you miss
The sweet and tender love
We used to share
Just go back to the places
Where we used to go
And I'll be there

How can I forget you
When there is always something there to remind me?
Always something there to remind me
I was born to love you
And I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me
Whoa-oo-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oo-oh

If you should find you miss
The sweet and tender love
We used to share
Just come back to the places
Where we used to go
And I'll be there

How can I forget you
When there is always something there to remind me?
Always something there to remind me
I was born to love you
And I will never be free
When there is
When there is
When, there, is
Always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
