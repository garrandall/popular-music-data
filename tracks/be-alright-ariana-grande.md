Midnight shadows
When finding love is a battle
But daylight is so close
So don't you worry 'bout a thing


We're gonna be alright
We're gonna be alright
We're gonna be alright


Baby, don't you know?
All of them tears gon' come and go
Baby, you just gotta make up your mind
That every little thing is gonna be alright
Baby, don't you know?
All of them tears gon' come and go
Baby, you just gotta make up your mind
We decide it


We're gonna be alright
We're gonna be alright
We're gonna be alright


In slow motion
Can't seem to get where we're going
But the hard times are golden
'Cause they all lead to better days


We're gonna be alright
We're gonna be alright
We're gonna be alright


Baby, don't you know?
All of them tears gon' come and go
Baby, you just gotta make up your mind
That every little thing is gonna be alright
Baby, don't you know?
All of them tears gon' come and go
Baby, you just gotta make up your mind
We decide it


We're gonna be alright
We're gonna be alright, oh baby
We're gonna be alright
We're gonna be alright
