I've gotten down to my last pair of shoes
Can't even win a nickel bet
Because, ah them that's got are them that gets
And I ain't got nothin' yet

I'm sneakin' in and out duckin' my landlord
All I seem to do is stay in debt
Because, ah them that's got (yeah) are them that gets
And I tell you all I ain't got nothin' yet

That old sayin' them that's got are them that gets
Is somethin' I can't see
If ya gotta have somethin'
Before you can get somethin'
How do ya get your first is still a mystery to me

I see folk with long cars and fine clothes
That's why they're called the smarter set
Because they manage to get
When only them that's got supposed to get
And I ain't got nothin' yet

That old sayin' them that's got are them that gets
Is somethin' I can't see
If ya gotta have somethin'
Before you can get somethin'
How do ya get your first is still a mystery to me

I see folk with long cars and fine clothes
That's why they're called the smarter set
Because they manage to get
When only them that's got supposed to get
And I ain't got nothin' yet

Whoa, I tell you all
I ain't found nothing yet

You know I just don't understand it
I can't seem to get a nickle or a dime for a cup of coffee

I need a hamburguer in fact a hot dog wouldn't be too bad
I would just be grateful if I could get my hands on most anything
