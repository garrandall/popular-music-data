Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom

If you cry, I think my heart would break
That would be much more than I could take
And if I saw a tear fall from your eye
Darling, don't you know that I would die?

True love, true love, true love, true love

Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom

If you cry, I don't know what I'll do
Baby, 'cause I'm so in love with you
And if I knew that I had caused you pain
My tears would fall like the rain

True love, true love, true love, true love

Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom
