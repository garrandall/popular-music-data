Think a little 'bout what you're sayin'
What's another day more or less
Gonna be a waitin' game
And I got the time if you get the message

What you gonna do about it
Got to hear the "go or stay"
Even if you go without me
You could never make me go away

You know it's true, you know you do
I don't know how, but I know you
I don't know how
But I know
I can find a way to get it right, yeah

I need to love you more
That's all I have to do
Think a little bit less of me
And a little bit more of you
I need to see you smile
The way you did before
Don't need to start again
Just need to love you more
Much more, much more
Oh lot more, yeah

Talk a little 'bout where we're goin'
Walk another mile down the road
Another part of life worth knowin'
I got the map if you got the ticket
Wouldn't wanna go without me
Wouldn't be much fun that way
Even if you did without me
You could never make me go away

You know it, too
You know it's true I don't know how
But I know you
I don't know why
But I know
I can find a way to get it right, yeah

I need to love you more
That's all I have to do
Think a little bit less of me
And a little bit more of you
I need to see you smile
The way you did before
Don't need to start again
Just need to love you more
Oh, lot more, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Give a little consideration
Only thing I've got to do
Think of all the implications
I can't think of losin' you
Wouldn't wanna go without you
Wouldn't be much fun that way
No, I couldn't go without you
No, I got to try to make you stay

You know I will, I'll try until
Can't try no more, then I'll try still
There ain't a lot for me to say
Except I got to find a way, yeah

Just need to love you more,
That's all I got to do
Think a little bit less of me
And a little bit more of you
I need to see you smile
The way you did before
Don't need to start again,
Just need to love you more

I need to love you more
That's all I got to do
Think a little bit less of me
And a little bit more of you
I need to see you smile
The way you did before
Don't need to start again,
Just need to love you more
Alright, alright

I need to see you smile
The way you did before
Don't need to start again
Just need to love you more
