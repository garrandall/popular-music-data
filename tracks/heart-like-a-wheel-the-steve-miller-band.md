I've got a heart like a wheel
Feel like I got to roll
Ooohh

Heart like a wheel
I told you so
And I've been loving you for so long
You are the one
Heart so real
I love you so

Well, I can give what I take
And you know I want to give you my love
Babe I ain't faking
You know I want to give you my love

I've been loving you for so long
You are the one
Heart so real
I love you so
Come on and roll

I've been loving you for so long
You are the one
Heart so real
I love you so

It takes two to make love
It takes love to make a family real
I got to know what you need
I got to know what you really feel

And I've been loving you for so long
You are the one
Heart so real
I love you so
Come on and roll

You know it's such a pity
If you're going to get the summertime blues
Lovers everywhere are pairing off two by twos

And I've been loving you for so long
You are the one
Heart so real
I love you so

I've been loving you for so long
You are the one
Heart so real
I love you so

I've got a heart like a wheel
I love you so

I've got a heart like a wheel
I've got to roll
