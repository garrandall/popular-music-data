Hey Tommy
What's the matter, you look down
(Man, I'm most disturbed)
Why (it's my girl)

(What do you mean)
She's involved with another guy
(Another guy)
An international personality (wow)

My baby went and
Fell in love with 007
He's the only one
She's thinking of, 007

Every night, where does she go
Downtown to the picture show
She waits in line for an hour or so
So she can sit in the very first row

Eating popcorn, smelling of perfume
Looking at him making out up there

Remember how she used to dress (yeah)
Sloppy sweaters, shades, boots (uh huh)
Not any more (not any more)
(How does she dress now)

You really want to know (yeah)
Wait til the end of this bar
And I'll tell you (okay)

My baby dresses up
Each night for 007
Wearing dresses that are
Much too tight for 007

Every night, what does she do
She makes up for an hour or two
She combs her hair
Then she teases it
Just so she can go and sit

In the first row of the movie
Eating popcorn, smelling of perfume
Looking at him making out up there

Why did she have
To fall in love with 007
He's the only one
She's thinking of, 007

Some day soon, wait and see
She'll come back to me

He's gonna fade from her memory
And things are gonna be
Like they used to be, I know it

We'll be together back in the balcony
Me and my baby, eating the popcorn

That's right Tommy
She'll get over it.
Hey, but did you see
That girl in his last picture

You mean the pilot
Yeah, what was her name
I don't know
