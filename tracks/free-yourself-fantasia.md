Baby you don't pay me no mind
You act like you don't love me no more
Maybe you need space or some time
Your attitude is uppredictable and I don't want to make you unhappy
If your not happy then your free to go on cuz I don't want you stayin around if I make you so
Miserable


If you don't want me then don't talk to me (if you don't want me then don't talk to me)
Go ahead and free yourself (go ahead and free yourself)
If you don't want me then don't talk to me (if you don't want me then don't talk to me)
Go ahead to someone else (go ahead to someone else)
If you don't want me then don't talk to me (if you don't want me then don't talk to me)
Go ahead and free yourself (go ahead and free yourself)
If you don't want me then don't talk to me (if you don't want me then don't talk to me)
Go ahead to someone else (go ahead to someone else)


Time again and again I tried I tried (baby don't you know I tried) but the love I had inside has
Died has died (but the love I had inside)

Wont you be a man if it's over and just admit that things aint the same instead of making me
Think its all good
Between us which ones the blame
I took a lot of too much to handle until I can't take this game no more this love thing is full
Of scandal so you welcome to walk

I had to take it there I had to take it there because I'm tired oh yeah



You play games if you don't want me don't talk to me
Hey go ahead and free yourself
Baby if you don't want me don't talk to me I'll be alright go ahead to someone else
Yeah yeah...
