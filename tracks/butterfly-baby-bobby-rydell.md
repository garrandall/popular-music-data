Butterfly Baby
Bobby Rydell

#23 in 1963

Butterfly Baby, lookin' around
Flyin' like crazy, all over town
Oh you little Butterfly Baby, I'll hang around
Hopin' that maybe someday you'll settle down
When you're done and there's only one
Who will your honey be?
Hear my plea, won't you let it be:
Me, it better be me!
Butterfly Baby, 'bout time you knew:
I love you like crazy, I love only you
Oh you little Butterfly Baby when will you see
Butterfly Baby, oooo, you've got a trial with me
----------
When you're done and there's only one
Who will your honey be?
Hear my plea won't you let it be
Me, it better be me!
Butterfly Baby, when you are free
You'll be my baby, ya, exclusively
Oh you little Butterfly Baby, then you will see
Butterfly Baby, oooo, you'll only fly with me
Wa-ooooo, wa-ooooo
Wa-ooooo, wa-ooooo
Wa-ooooo, wa-ooooo
Wa-ooooo. . .
