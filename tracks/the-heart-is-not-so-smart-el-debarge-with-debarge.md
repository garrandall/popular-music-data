You know that she is just a heartbreak in disguise
You know that fallin' for the girl is not so wise
But every time your mind wants you to stay away
Your heart just looks the other way

Oh... oh... she's all that you want now
Oh... oh... she's nothin' you need
No... oh... but there you go
Blame it all on love, you know you should know better

But the heart is not so smart
Can't always trust it, no
The heart is not so smart
Goes where it should not go

Always seems to find
It's way to trouble, no
The heart is not so smart
Oh, no, oh, no

The heart's been broken, it's been bruised and it's been burned
So after that you think a lesson might be learned
But it keeps falling for the same lines every time
Sometimes the heart can be so blind

Oh... oh... and when you discover
Oh... oh... she's tellin' you lies
Oh... oh... well, don't you know
That the heart is always last to realize

Because the heart is not so smart
Can't always trust it, no
The heart is not so smart
Goes where it should not go

Always seems to find
It's way to trouble, no
The heart is not so smart
Oh, no

Oh... they say trust your emotions
Oh... oh... your feelings inside
Oh... oh... when it comes to love
Sometimes it's better that the heart is not your guide

Because the heart is not so smart
The heart is not so smart

The heart is not so smart
Can't always trust it, no
The heart is not so smart
Goes where it should not go

Always seems to find
It's way to trouble, no

The heart is not so smart
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh
The heart is not so smart
No, no, no, no

The heart is not so smart
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh
The heart is not so smart, no, no
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa

The heart is not so smart
You can't always trust it, no
The heart is not so smart
No, no, no, no

The heart is not so smart
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh
The heart is not so smart, no, no
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, whoa

The heart is not so smart
Can't always trust it, no
The heart is not so smart
No, no, no, no

The heart is not so smart
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh
The heart is not so smart, no, no
