Another sleepless night, pretending everything's alright
But we know the truth can't hide, yeah
I wonder, could we ever be happy
If we just let it ride

Cause there's something missing
There's too much distance now
It's so confusing
But there's no use in beating round the bush
You should know I never will forget you
But now I think it's time I gotta let you go

I can feel your heart breaking every word that I'm saying
Like a knife just waiting to stop the beating
And I hate the fact I'm making you cry
But it's better than living a lie
And I'm trying but I know that I
Can't find a better way to say goodbye, say goodbye, say goodbye
Is there a better way to say goodbye? Say goodbye, say goodbye

There's so much world out there and I don't wanna be unfair
Cause there's someone for you somewhere, yeah
And I only want you to be happy
Because I really care

It's not the way we planned it
So let's not drag this out
The clock is ticking
You gotta listen, listen to your heart
Baby don't you know you can't control this
I don't wanna hurt you, but you know it's time

I can feel your heart breaking every word that I'm saying
Like a knife just waiting to stop the beating
And I hate the fact I'm making you cry
But it's better than living a lie
And I'm trying but I know that I
Can't find a better way to say goodbye

Maybe in another place
Maybe in another time
When the stars are all aligned
If we're gonna make things right
Then we gotta walk away

I can feel your heart breaking every word that I'm saying
Like a knife just waiting to stop the beating
And I hate the fact I'm making you cry
But it's better than living a lie
And I'm trying but I know that I
Can't find a better way to say goodbye, say goodbye, say goodbye
Is there a better way to say goodbye? Say goodbye, say goodbye
Can't find a better way to say goodbye, say goodbye, say goodbye
Is there a better way to say goodbye? Say goodbye, say goodbye
