You have said as much as you can say
Your heart is just about to overflow
Must be something more I can do
Some new plateau
I'm listening to you
Dying to know
Everything that your feeling
Every change you undergo
Just don't tell me that you love me
Because I do' wanna know
I do' wanna know how much you love me
I do' wanna know how much you care
I do' wanna, I do' wanna, I do' wanna know
I do' wanna do what I'm supposed to
I do' wanna wear what I'm supposed to wear
I do' wanna, I do' wanna, I do' wanna know

You are gonna do what you must do
You are gonna go where you want to go
You are gonna hear what you hear
Fear what you fear
Don't say a word
Don't let it show
You will be what you will be
You will reap everything you sow
Just don't tell me that you love me
Because I do' wanna know
