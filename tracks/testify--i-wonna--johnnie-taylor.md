Let me tell you something about myself
I'm not ashamed to stand up and testify
I think every man oughta
Stand up and testify

Friend, inquisitive friend
I'm asking what's come all over me
I've changed, I've been changed
It's so plain for everybody to see

Then something came over me
It took me by surprise
Happiness is all around me
You can even see it in my eyes
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I just wanna testify
What your love has done for me
Let me say I just wanna testify
What your love has done for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

As for me, I'm running now
Let me say (I'm running now)
Oh, right now (running away)

Once, I was a hard man
In which a lonely heart did dwell
Your love sneak up on me
And brought life to an empty shell

I've heard so many times before
That love can be so bad
I just got to tell you that
It's the best love I ever had

Let me say I just wanna testify
What your love has done for me
Oh, I just wanna testify
What your love has done for me

Luscious
You sure been delicious to me
Baby, can't you see
You sure been delicious to me

Somebody, help me say it
(Luscious, sure been delicious
Sure been delicious)
(Luscious, sure been delicious
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'm not ashamed to
Stand up and testify
And every, every man oughta
Stand up and testify
Every woman oughta
Stand up and testify

Just a little while ago
My life was so incomplete
I forgot, forgot, oh, Lord
I look up at my feet

Let me say
I just got to testify
What your love has done for me
I just got to testify
What your love has done for me
