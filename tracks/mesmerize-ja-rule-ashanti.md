Haha, yeah
Whattup ma? How you been
Yeah I know, I know, hehe
It's all good.. (Murder Inc.)


Girl your stare, those eyes I (love it when you look at me baby)
Your lips, your smile I (love it when you kiss me baby)
Your hips, those thighs, I (love it when you thug me baby)
And I can't, deny I (love it when I'm witchu baby)


I, got a fetish for fuckin you witcha skirt on
On the backstreet in the back seat of the Yukon
What's takin so long? I'm gettin anxious
but patiently waitin for you to tell a nigga to move on
Between me and you, we can find each other
flyin abroad in my private G-2
I ain't tryin to G you, ma I'm tryin to see you
Bend over, you know how we do it, feet to shoulders
Bring heat to coldest night, so ferocious
Now you street promotin the dick game is potent
Cause in the bed a nigga go hard like Jordan
Sweat pourin, lovin the way you be moanin
Grippin the sheets, lookin at me lickin at me
Cause every woman just wanna be happy
And it's CRA-ZAY, but BAY-BAY, I.. (love it when I'm witchu baby)




I wanna get away, cause you know like I know
And there's a better day, a-comin, I'm hooked on your lovin
Believe me, and when you hold my body
I know you need me, wait for me bay-bay
I've been goin half crazy for your love
And I was told that the sex, better than drugs
Then get addicted, boy listen
I'm the only piece of the puzzle you're missin
Like when we kissin - bye bye bye
You got a girl that'll - ride ride ride
So take me, tonight
And do what you do to me baby




Shorty, are you really gettin bored with me, or him?
Cause though I play a lot of games, I play 'em to win
(But then again I'm still young and I'm livin my life)
You know you're right and I'm the type
to pull up to your bumper, get your number
(BABY, I can only help but wonder)
What life would be without (my sweet baby)
And you're my baby (holla if you hear me)



You can understand that my love is pain
And how I feel in vain, it's just a woman thang
(It's a man's world, but I understand)
But there's still nothin different boy, stick to the plan
(You be my down ass, witcha round ass)
I know I'm feelin you (like you feelin me)
The way you're holdin my body, the way you touch me




I love when you touch me baby
All over my body baby
I love when you kiss me baby
All over my body baby
