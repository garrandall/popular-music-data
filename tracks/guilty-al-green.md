Girl I love you
Yeah, yeah, honest I do
And I'm guilty, baby
On being untrue

What you heard
Through the grapevine
Every word it's true
Now the blame's all mine you all

I'm guilty
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm guilty, guilty, guilty
Baby, I'm guilty of this crime

Don't condemn me
Or cast me aside
'Cause I'm gonna be good to you
Love to you is more, more important
Than your foolish pride, oh

Just put me on probation
Loving you is my
Yeah, an infatuation

Guilty, yeah
Oh, I'm guilty
But listen

Don't condemn me, baby, baby, baby
Or cast me aside
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Loving you is more hard
Than your foolish pride

All you got to do is
Just put me on probation
Loving you is more, yeah
Than infatuation

'Cause I'm guilty
Not so guilty, guilty
Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty
Don't condemn me
