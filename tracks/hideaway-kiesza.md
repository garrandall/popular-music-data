Taking me higher than I've ever been before
I'm holding it back, just want to shout out, give me more
You're just a hideaway
You're just a feeling
You let my heart escape
Beyond the meaning
Not even I can find a way to stop the storm
Oh baby, it's out of my control
It's going home
But you're just a chance I take
To keep on dreaming
You're just another day
That keeps me breathing


Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure
Baby, don't stop me
Hideaway with me some more
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh


You send me the shiver and the spine, might overflow
You're bringing me closer to the edge
I'm letting go
You're just a hideaway
You're just a feeling
You let my heart escape
Beyond the meaning
Pulling my head into the clouds
I'm floating off
When you can be going I can't find a way to stop
You're just a chance I take
To keep on dreaming
You're just another day that keeps me breathing
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh


Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure
Baby, don't stop me
Hideaway with me some more
Hideaway with me some more


You're bringing me higher than I've ever been before
I'm holding it back, just want to shout it, give me more
But you're just a hideaway
You're just a feeling
You let my heart escape
Beyond the meaning
Not even I can find a way to stop the storm
Oh baby, its out of my control what's going on
You're just a chance I take
To keep on dreaming
You're just another day, that keeps me breathing
You're a day that keeps me dreaming
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh


Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure
Baby, don't stop me
Hideaway with me some more
Hideaway with me some more
