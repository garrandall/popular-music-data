Taking me high up where I've never been before
I'm holding it back, just one sec, I won't be long
You're just a hideaway, you're just a feeling
You let my heart escape, beyond the meaning
Not even I can't find a way to stop the storm
Oh, baby, it's out of my control, it's going home
You're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming
You're just another day that keeps me breathing
Baby, another week-end, there's nothing sure
Baby, don't stop me, hide away with me some more!


Shawty don't stop, get a Coke Boy
Pull up to the spot in a dope toy (skoot)
If the head good, might spend on it (spend on it)
Got it like shoulda been on it
Keep it goin', don't stop now
Pull up in the winter with the top down
Feelin' like a dolla,  now
Got the club down, hear the cops now
Woot, black toupÃ©e
100 on the watch, not a dime on the skank
Try slide, shawty I ain't with the game (nah)
Woke up, I ain't even know her name
Weak, money y'all be slackin'
Get the benjis and the jacksons
Private islands we relaxin'
Got yo groovin' fingers snappin'


Uh, you send me the shiver and the spine might overflow
You're bringing me closer to the edge, I'm letting go
You're just a hideaway, you're just a feeling
You let my heart escape, beyond the meaning
Cover my head into the clouds I'm falling low
When letting me go and I can't find a way to stop
You're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming
You're just another day that keeps me breathing
Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure
Baby, don't stop me, hide away with me some more
Oh oh ah, hide away with me some more
Taking me high up where I've never been before
I'm holding it back, just one sec, I won't be long
You're just a hideaway, you're just a feeling
You let my heart escape, beyond the meaning
Not even I can't find a way to stop the storm
Oh, baby, it's out of my control, it's going on!
You're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming
You're just another day that keeps me breathing
Baby, another week-end, there's nothing sure
Baby, don't stop me, hide away with me some more!
