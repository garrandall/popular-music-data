Guess who just got back today?
Them wild-eyed boys that'd been away
Haven't changed, had much to say
But man, I still think them cats are crazy
They were askin' if you were around
How you was, where you could be found
Told them you were livin' downtown
Drivin' all the old men crazy

The boys are back in town
(The boys are back in town)
I said, the boys are back in town (The boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town
(The boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town
(The boys are back in town)

You know that chick that used to dance a lot
Every night, she'd be on the floor, shakin' what she's got
Man, when I tell ya she was cool, she was red hot
I mean she was steamin'
And that time over at Johnny's place
Well, this chick got up and she
Slapped Johnny's face
Man, we just fell about the place
If that chick don't wanna know, forget her
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
I said, the boys are back in town
The boys are back in town

The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town

{Instrumental}

Spread the word around guess who's back in town
You spread the word around

Friday night they'll be dressed to kill
Down at Dino's bar and grill
The drink will flow, and blood will spill
And if the boys wanna fight you
Better let 'em
That jukebox in the corner
Blasting out my favorite song
The nights are gettin' warmer
It won't be long
Won't be long 'til summer comes
Now that the boys are here again

The boys are back in town
(The boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town
(The boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town
(The boys are back in town)
Spread the word around

The boys are back in town
(The boys are back in town)
The boys are back, the boys are back
The boys are back in town again
They're hangin' down at Dino's
The boys are back in town again!
