Woah oh baby, yeah yeah
Woah, woah


If I believe in love
And you believe in love
Then we could be in love, somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now


Don’t let this effort go to waste
Put our all in it
Don’t wanna be left with the question, why?
Let’s be honest with ourselves
Did we really come this far
Just to watch it go down the drain?


Sometimes the heart can see
What’s invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don’t ever lie
Giving up is immature
We got so much more to live for
They don’t wanna see us together now
Let's be strong enough to endure, oh


If I believe in love
And you believe in love
Then we can be in love, somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now


Growing pains come along with these changes
Some people get closer
Some people separate, yeah
Don’t think we should separate
When we both adore one another
You’re a dream come true
We should start over brand new
That’s what we oughta do, yeah


Yeah, sometimes the heart can see
What’s invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don’t ever lie
Giving up is immature, oh
We got so much more to live for, oh
They don’t wanna see us together now, oh
Let's be strong enough to endure, oh


If I believe in love
And you believe in love
Then we can be in love, somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now


Trust me right now
Yea, yea, yea
Oh we gotta learn to trust now
Yea, yea, yea
Girl you gotta learn to trust me now
Yea, yea
If I believe in love like you believe in love
Then we could be in love
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
We gotta learn to trust
We gotta learn to trust
Yeah, ohh, ohh
