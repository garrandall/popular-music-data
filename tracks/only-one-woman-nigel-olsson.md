Ten little Indians standing around
I bet there are many but how would I know
As she was only one woman
Only one woman
And I've got a picture
Of the woman I love

Who sees my lonely face, who sees my shame
Nobody in the place can tell me her name
’Cause she was only one woman
Only one woman
And I've got a picture
Of the woman I love

‘Cause she was only one woman
Only one woman
And I've got a picture
Of the woman I love

Ten little Indians, now there are none
I bet there are many, but her love still goes on
She was only one woman
Only one woman
And I’ve got a picture
Of the woman, the woman, the woman
The woman I love

She was only one woman
Only one woman
And I've got a picture
Of the woman I love
She was only one woman
Only one woman
And I've got a picture
Of the woman I love
