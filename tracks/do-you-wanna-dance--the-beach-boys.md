Do you wanna dance and hold my hand?
Tell me, baby, I'm your lover man
Oh baby, do you wanna dance?


Do you wanna dance under the moonlight
Hold me, baby, all through the night
Oh baby, do you wanna dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?


Do you wanna dance under the moonlight
Kiss me, baby, all through the night
Oh baby, do you wanna dance?


Do you want to dance under the moonlight
Squeeze me, squeeze me all through the night
Oh baby, do you wanna dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?


Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?


Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
