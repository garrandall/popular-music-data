It keep rainin' an rainin'
Tears from my eyes
Since you've gone
All I do is cry

Won't somebody help me?
Somebody help me
Can't you see?
That my baby done left me

She left me reelin' and rockin'
Walkin' the floor
She left a note last night
She won't be back no more

It keep rainin' an rainin'
Tears from my eyes
Since you gone
All I do is cry

Won't somebody help me
Somebody help me?
Can't you see?
That my baby done left me

She left me reelin' and rockin'
Walkin' the floor
She left a note last night
She won't be back no more
