Changing Faces, Jay-Z, R. Kelly
Yeah, check her
Uh huh, Changing faces
How we do

Yo, all of my rhymes fall
All of my days I trade
All of my dimes and all of my bad ways I fade
Killing late nights cruisin'
All you see is the brake lights, and hair blowin
You know where we goin'

Or at the club in the rear frontin'
Poppin' droppin'
And E amounts some cats will wear
Ain't trying to hear nothin'
Probaby was wilder than Bobbie
Are you the Whitney to get me
Hold me down and make me slow down be be twizzy

Keep the ice out the club lights changing faces
Get a little wifey on the license plates
Wait, make me think about you even when you not around
Use the bathroom, put the toilet seat back down
Cop you some sprinkles that hand with the wrinkles
If preferred his and her firs to the ankles
Keep your friends buggin', lovin' all my ways
Jigger, keep you jiggy
All of my days


In the middle of the night
You got me thinking 'bout you, babe
Got me dreaming 'bout you, baby


(All that I have) All that I have
(Baby, it's yours) Baby it's yours
Forever and ever, baby


All I want is (All I want)
To be with you
All of my days
All I want, all I need

All I want is (All I want)
To be with you
All of my days (All I want, yeah)

Anything to turn you on
I'll be giving it to you, babe
You don't have to worry, baby

All I want is
To be with you all of my days
(All I want, yeah, hey)


Check it
All I want, all I need
Is you in my life
Loving me

All I want, all I need
Is you in my life (uh huh)
Loving me


Now we going house shoppin
Everybody wanna know the price your spouse droppin'
Keep that on the low R.Kelly style
It's quite shockin'
A year ago, all I did was spend nights hoppin'
In the club in search of pretty faces and nice stockins'
Who woulda thought I'd walk down the isle, rice dropping
Gotchu a nice rock and
Now it's on they poppin', droppin'
Hotter than platinum bracelets
Jigger R. Kelly, Changing Faces, uh


All I want is
To be with you all of my days
All I want, all I need
