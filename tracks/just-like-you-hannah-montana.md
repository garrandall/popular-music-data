So what you see
Is only half the story
There's another side of me
I'm the girl you know
But I'm someone else too
If you only knew

It's a crazy life
But I'm alright
I got everything I've always wanted
Living the dream

So yeah, everything I've always wanted
Isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl
Whose dreams came true

But underneath it all
I'm just like you
(Yeah, yeah)
Don't wanna be treated differently
I wanna keep it all inside

Half the time I've got my name in lights
The other half I'm by your side
It's a crazy life
But I'm just fine

I got everything I've always wanted
Living the dream
So yeah, everything I've always wanted
Isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl

Whose dreams came true
But underneath it all
I'm just like you
Yeah-ee yeah
Can't you see

I'm just an ordinary girl
Living in an extra-ordinary world
Trying to live
Trying to learn

Trying to just be who I am
Who I am
I got everything I've always wanted
Living the dream (the dream)

So yeah, everything I've always wanted (always wanted)
Isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl
Whose dreams came true

But underneath it all
I'm just like you
I got everything I've always wanted
Living the dream (livin' the dream)
So yeah, everything I've always wanted (always wanted)
Isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl
Whose dreams came true
But underneath it all
I'm just like you
