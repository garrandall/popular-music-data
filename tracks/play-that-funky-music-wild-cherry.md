Hey, do it now
Yeah, hey


Hey, once I was a boogie singer
Playin' in a Rock and Roll Band
I never had no problems, yeah
Burnin' down the one night stands
And everything around me, yeah
Got to stop to feelin' so low
And I decided quickly (Yes I did)
To disco down and check out the show


Yeah, they was dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groove
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted:
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music till you die
'Til you die
Oh ya, ya


I tried to understand this
I thought that they were out of their minds
How could I be so foolish (How could I)
To not see I was the one behind
So still I kept on fighting
Well, losing every step of the way
I said, I must go back there (I got to go back)
And check to see if things still the same


Yeah they was dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music till you die
'Til you die, ya
'Til you die

(Gonna play some of that electrified funky music, yeah)



(Hey, wait a minute)


Now first it wasn't easy
Changin' rock and roll and minds
And things were getting shaky
I thought I'd have to leave it behind
But now it's so much better (it's so much better)
I'm funking out in every way
But I'll never lose that feelin' (no I won't)
Of how I learned my lesson that day


When they were dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music till you die
'Til you die
Oh' till you die
They shouted play that funky music
(Play that funky music)
Play that funky music
(You gotta keep on playin' funky music)
Play that funky music
(Play that funky music)
Play that funky music
(Come and take you higher, ya)
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right, yeah
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
