Have I told you
Lately that I love you
If I din't, darlin',
You see, I'm so sorry
Didn't I reach out
And hold you
In these lovin' arms
Well, if I didn't, oh baby.
Well, I'm so sorry

When I realized that you need love too,
Gonna spend my life makin' love to you.
Got to be a lover.
Have mercy.
Forgot to be a lover, babe. (Have mercy)
Forgot to be a lover. (Have mercy)
Forgot to be a lover.
Make it on through to you somehow. (Have mercy, baby)
Got to be a lover, babe. (Forgot to be a lover)
Woo! Woo!

Well, did I ask you,
Yes, would you come and share,
Oh, share,
Oh, the burden and the task
That's at love's command
Didn't I say
All those lovin' special things
That you long to hear
To show how much I care

Well, when I realize
That you need love too,
Gonna spend my life
Makin' love to you
Forgot to be a lover,
Have mercy

Well, well I worked all day
Hard as I can
Worked all night, didn't make me a man. 
(Forgot to be a lover)
Have mercy, Oo,

When I realized
That you need love too,
Gonna spend my life
Makin' love to you. (Forgot to be a lover)
Got to be a lover, babe.
Oo, mercy. (Have mercy)
Have mercy, baby. (Have mercy, baby)

I'm gonna make it on through
To you somehow,
So have mercy. (Have mercy, have mercy, baby)

Have I told you,
Yes, lately that I love you
If I didn't, oh baby,
Yes, I'm so sorry.
Ah, but you know I really love you, baby.(Love you baby)
I really love you baby (Love you baby) 
I really need you baby (Need you baby) 
I really want you baby (Want you baby)

When I realized,
That you need love too,
I'm gonna spend my life
Makin' love,
Makin' love,
Makin' love to you
Well, I worked all day
As hard as I can,
Worked all night,
It didn't make me a man, babe.
(Forgot to be a lover) (Have mercy)
Oo, have mercy baby (Have mercy)
Have mercy baby (Have mercy)
Oo, have mercy baby (Have mercy baby)
Oo, make it through.

Well, when I realized that you need love too,
I'm gonna spend my life,
Gotta spend my life makin' love to you.
