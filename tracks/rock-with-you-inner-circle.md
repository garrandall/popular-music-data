Yeah! All I wanna do is rock with you
Love is me
Love is you
All I wanna do is rock with you
Shout it out an' tell ya friends too
Love is me
Love is you
This is what we wanna do
Yeah


Let's talk a while
My friend
Find out what's on your mind
Drift away in a darkness
We've ben sleepin' much too long

Enough! it's time to get up!
We gotta carry on (carry on)
Let's carry on (carry on)

Like a rose in the summer
In the midst of thorns
Our love must grow
The rivers must flow
We've been sleepin' much too long enough!

It's time to rise!
We gotta carry on (carry on)
We gotta carry on (carry on)



We gotta carry on (carry on)
Let's carry on (carry on)
Love is me
Love is you
Enough!

It's time to rise
