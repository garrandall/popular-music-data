I want security, yeah
Without it I had a great loss, oh now
Security, yeah
And I want it at any cost, oh now

Don't want no money, right muh now, muh now, muh now
I don't want no fame
But security I have all of these things, yeah
All of these things, yeah, now
Security, yeah
That's all I want from you, oh now
Security, yeah
And a little love that will be true, oh

Those sweet tender lips you know they tells me that
You're the one for me

Darling, how can I forget
How can I forget, yeah now

I want security, yeah
I'm telling you, once say again, oh now
Security
And I want it in the end, oh

Those sweet tender lips you know they tells me that
You're the one for me
Darling, how can I forget
How can I forget, yeah now

Alone with just a little bit of soul, right now, now, baby
Darling, everything is gonna be allright
One more time, just one more time, baby...
