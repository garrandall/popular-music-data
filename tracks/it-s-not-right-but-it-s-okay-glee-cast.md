Friday night you and your boys went out to eat
Then they hung out
But you came home around three, yes you did
If six of y'all went out
Then four of you were really cheap
'Cause only two of you had dinner
I found your credit card receipt


It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags, up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me

It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you
Leave your key
I'd rather be alone
Than unhappy

Uh uh uh yeah uh


I'll pack your bags
So you can leave town for a week, yes I am
The phone rings
And then you look at me

You said it was one of your friends
Down on 54th Street, boy
So why did 2-1-3
Show up on your caller ID?


It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags, up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me

It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you
Leave your key
I'd rather be alone
Than unhappy


I have been through all of this before
(I've been through all this before)
So how would you think
(Don't think about, don't think about it)
That I could stand around and take some more?
(Get goin', get goin')
Things are gonna change
(Things are goin' to change baby)
'Cos I don't wanna be a fool anymore
(You don't stand no chance boy)
That's why you have to leave
(I say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahhh)
So don't turn around to see my face
(Don't turn around)


There's no more tears left here
For you to see


Was it really worth you going out like that, tell me
Was it really worth you going out like that
See, I'm moving on
And I refuse to turn back
See all of this time
I thought I had somebody down for me
It turns out


You were making a fool of me

Uh uh uh yeah uh


It's not right, but it's okay
(It's not right, it's okay)
I'm gonna make it anyway
(I'm gonna, I'm gonna, yeahhh)
Pack your bags, up and leave
(Close the door and leave your keys)
Don't you dare come running back to me
(I'd rather be alone than unhappy)
It's not right, but it's okay
(It's not right, it's okay baby)
I'm gonna make it anyway
(I can pay my own rent)
Close the door behind you
(Pay my light bills)
Leave your key
(Take care my business)
I'd rather be alone
(Oh, oh)
Than unhappy
(Woah Ohhh)
