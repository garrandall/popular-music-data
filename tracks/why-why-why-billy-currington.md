I've been your lover, I've been your friend
I've been your faithful one-woman man
I've been your diamond in the rough
Now you say you wanna polish me up


Why, why, why do you wanna change me now?
Ain't I the one you loved everything about?
You might start missin' the old me around
So why, why, why do you wanna change me now

I remember you used to like
Walkin' with me on my wilder side
My kind of crazy turned you on
Do you really want that part of me gone?


Why, why, why do you wanna change me now?
Ain't I the one you loved everything about?
You might start missin' the old me around
So why, why, why do you wanna change me now

Why, why, why
Ain't I the one?
You might start missin'


Why, why, why do you wanna change me now?
Ain't I the one you loved everything about?
You might start missin' the old me around
So why, why, why do you wanna change me now
