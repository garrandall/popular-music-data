Everybody's laughing in my mind
Rumours spreading 'bout this other guy
Do you do what you did when you did with me? Does he love you the way I can?
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me? Cause baby I didn't


That should be me holding your hand
That should be me making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
'Til you believe that that should be me, that should be me


You said you needed a little time for my mistakes
It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced
Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies? What you doing to me, you're taking him where we used to go
Now if you're tryna break my heart, it's working because you know that


That should be me holding your hand
That should be me making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
'Til you believe that that should be me


I need to know should I fight for love or disarm
It's getting harder to shield this pain in my heart
Oh

That should be me holding your hand
That should be me making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
'Til you believe that that should be me
Holding your hand, that should be me
The one making you laugh oh baby, oh that should be me
That should be me giving you flowers, that should be me talking for hours
That should be me, that should be me, that should be me


Never shoulda let you go, I never shoulda let you go
That should be me
I'm never gonna let you go
That should be me
I'm never shoulda let you go
I'm never gonna let you go
That should be me
I'm never gonna let you go
