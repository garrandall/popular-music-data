Friday night, it was late
I was walking you home
We got down to the gate
And I was dreaming of the night
Would it turn out right?

How to tell you, girl
I wanna build my world around you
Tell you that it's true
I wanna make you understand 
I'm talking about a lifetime plan

That's the way it began
We were hand-in-hand
Glenn Miller's band 
Was better than before
We yelled and screamed for more

And the Porter tune (Night and Day)
Made us dance across the room
It ended all too soon
And on the way back home 
I promised you'd never be alone

Hurry, don't be late
I can't hardly wait
I said to myself when we're old
We'll go dancing in the dark
Walking through the park
And reminiscing

Friday night, it was late
I was walking you home
We got down to the gate
And I was dreaming of the night
Would it turn out right?

Now as the years roll on
Each time we hear our favorite song
The memories come along
Older times we're missing
Spending the hours reminiscing

Hurry, don't be late
I can't hardly wait
I said to myself when we're old
We'll go dancing in the dark
Walking through the park
And reminiscing
