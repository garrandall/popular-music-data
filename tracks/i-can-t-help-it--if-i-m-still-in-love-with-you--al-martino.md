(I can't help it if I'm
Still in love with you)

Today, I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm
Still in love with you

Somebody else stood by your side
And he looks so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm
Still in love with you

A picture from the past
Came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm
And walked so close to you

Then suddenly I got
That old time feeling
I can't help it if I'm
Still in love with you

Today, I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm
Still in love with you

Somebody else stood by your side
And he looks so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm
Still in love with you

It's hard to know
Another's lips will kiss you
And hold you just
The way I used to do

Oh, Heaven only knows
How much I miss you
I can't help it if I'm
Still in love with you

I can't help it if I'm
Still in love with you
