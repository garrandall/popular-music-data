Yo, this is MÃ½a
You know the hook
You see the bait
I know you want a bite
So why procrastinate?
Come on, yeah
Yes, you feelin' this
What you doin' over there?
You feel me?
Bring it over here and see what you got?
Listen


Everybody knows that, yeah, I'm kind of shy
And I'm not the kind of girl who could ever approach a guy
But I wanna find a way to get you to notice me
I got a four-wheel drive, 5'5", brown eyes
Then maybe you can handle these
Because I'm free


Free... single, sexy and sweet
Making my own money
Looking for the right party
And if you're free... spit your best game at me
If you like what you see
Maybe I'll let you share my fantasy


Now, I don't need a man in my life tryin' to tie me down
And I don't wanna player who got kids all over town
Don't want his curl juice dripping all over my Mercedes seat
I can't stand a man who thinks he looks better than me
I'm looking for a brother who like to have fun
A fly gentleman who knows how to please a woman
The last thing I need is a man that's soft
He better get it on up and break me off
Some a that fly high rise, 6'5", ain't shy
And that's the kind of man I need
Because I'm free


Free... single, sexy and sweet
Making my own money
Looking for the right party
And if you're free... spit your best game at me
If you like what you see
Maybe I'll let you share (Can you handle me)

Free... single, sexy and sweet
Making my own money
Looking for the right party
And if you're free... spit your best game at me
If you like what you see (Come on, yeah)
Maybe I'll let you share my fantasy


Mmm
If you're having a good time just let go and don't be shy
Come on yeah... oh yeah
If you're down to do whatever
Then let's sing this song together
I'm free, oh come on and be free with me

Free... Uh, that's right


Free... single, sexy and sweet
Making my own money
Looking for the right party (Don't you know I'm free!)
And if you're free... spit your best game at me (Come on)
If you like what you see
Maybe I'll let you share my fantasy


Last chance
Everybody in the house... high rise
All the brothers up in here... 6'5"
Gotta get in on up... Get high
You know you looking good tonight... tonight
All the ladies in the house... 5'5"
Gotta show them what you got... thick thighs
Freak 'em on the floor... Get high
You know you looking good tonight... tonight


Oh boy, you look so good to me
You might get lucky
Cause I feel free tonight
Are you available?
Did you come here alone?
Won't you hang out with me
I'll freak you on the dance floor


If you're having a good time (Freakin' on the dance floor)
I'm sexy and I'm free (Everybody feelin' alright)
I'm free and I'm sexy (Just to let you know, uh huh)
I'm spendin' money tonight (I'm free)
Party over here (Alright, come on)
There's a party over there (6'5, come on)
If you're having a good time (Ain't shy)
Put your hands in the air (I'm tryna have fun)
All the fellas (High rise)
All the hustlers (6'5)
All the ladies (Ain't shy)
Get it up, get it up, get it up (I'm free)
Come dance with me (Thick thighs)
I'm single and I'm sexy and free
