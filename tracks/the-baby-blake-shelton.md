My brother said that I
Was rotten to the core
I was the youngest child
So I got by with more


I guess she was tired by
The time I came along
She'd laugh until she cried
I could do no wrong
She would always save me
Because I was her baby


I worked a factory in Ohio
A shrimp boat in the Bayou
I drove a truck in Birmingham
Turned 21 in Cincinnati
I called home to mom and daddy
I said "Your boy is now a man"
She said "I don't care if you're 80
Youâ€™ll always be my baby"


She loved that photograph
Of our whole family
She'd always point us out
For all her friends to see


That's Greg he's doing great
He really loves his job
And Ronnie with his 2 kids
How about that wife he's got
And that one's kind of crazy
But that one is my baby


I got a call in Alabama
Said come on home to Louisiana
And come as fast as you can fly
Cause your mamma really needs you
And says she's got to see you
She might not make it through the night
The whole way I drove 80
So she could see her baby


She looked like she was sleeping
And my family had been weeping
By the time that I got to her side
And I knew that she'd been taken
And my heart it was breaking
I never got to say goodbye


I softly kissed that lady
And cried just like a baby
