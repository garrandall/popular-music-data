two feet they come a creeping like a black cat do
and two bodies are laying naked the creeper thinks he's got nothing to lose
so he creeps into this house and unlocks the door
and as a man's reaching for his trousers he shoots him full of thirty eight holes
mister saturday night special got a barrel that's blue and cold
it ain't no good for nothing but put a man six feet in a hole
big jim's been drinking whiskey and playing poker on a losing night
and pretty soon old jim starts a thinking somebody been cheating and lying
so big jim commences to fighting i wouldn't tell you no lie
and big jim done pulled his pistol he shot his friend right between the eyes
mister saturday night special got a barrel that's blue and cold
it ain't no good for nothing but put a man six feet in a hole
mister saturday night special for twenty dollars you can buy yourself one too
hand guns are made for killing they ain't no good for nothing else
and if you like to drink your whiskey you might even shoot yourself
so why don't we dump them people to the bottom of the sea
before some old fool comes around here and want to shoot either you or me
mister saturday night special got a barrel that's blue and cold
it ain't no good for nothing but put a man six feet in a hole
mister saturday night special i'd like to tell you what you can do with it too
