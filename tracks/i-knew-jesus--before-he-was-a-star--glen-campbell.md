Well funny it seems as how everyone knows him now
Suddenly they have found someone who's been around
Back to the fold they come seeking his wisdom from a far
I knew Jesus before he was a superstar
Well you know I'm a believer in all that he's ever been
Stories I've read of him things that were said of him
Songs that they glorify I used to play on my guitar yes I did
I knew Jesus before he was a superstar
I've known his goodness and mercy for all my days
I've seen his blessings around me in every way
In times of trouble when I had no hope in view
Who brought the sunlight the one light that I knew
Oh yes I knew he was always there answering every prayer
Fame will not change him much he won't be out of touch
Great as he is today big people stay the way they are yes they do
I knew Jesus before he was a superstar
I've known his goodness...
I knew Jesus before he was a superstar
I knew Jesus before he was a superstar
