Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me

Dance with me
Oh hold me closer, closer and closer
Much closer while the music plays

My little darlin'
Won't you dance with me?
Oh hold me tighter, tighter and tighter
Much tighter while the rhythm sways

Hm put your lips to mine
While the music blends
We're no longer strangers
Now we're more than friends so

Dance with me
Dance with me closer, closer and closer
And maybe we'll be lovers when the music ends

Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me

Dance with me
Dance with me closer, closer and closer
And maybe we'll be lovers when the music ends

Darlin' won't you please, oh?
Darlin' won't you please, oh?
Darlin' won't you please?
Oh yeah?
Oh oh oh
