What dream was I dreaming, darling
When I found you
A dream that wouldn't let me see that
Can't be true
Your hope on me is right
'Cause tomorrow you'll be gone

Don't stop now
You got me where you want me
Don't stop now
You got me where you want me, girl

Just promise me little girl
You won't leave me alone to cry
And I'll try hard to believe
All of your little lies
Your hope on me is right
'Cause tomorrow you'll be gone

Don't stop now
You got me where you want me
Don't stop now
You got me where you want me, girl

Just hold me
A little longer
Just hold me
A little longer

Don't stop now
You got me where you want me
Don't stop now
You got me where you want me, girl

Just hold me
A little longer
And I know our love
Will grow a little stronger

Don't stop now
You got me where you want me
Don't stop now
You got me where you want me, girl
