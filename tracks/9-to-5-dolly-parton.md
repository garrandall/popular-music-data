Tumble out of bed and stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch and try to come to life

Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumping
Out on the streets, the traffic starts jumping
For folks like me on the job from 9 to 5

Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living
Barely getting by, it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind, and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it

They let you dream, just a watch them shatter
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away

In the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waiting to the day your ship'll come in
And the tide's gonna turn
And it's all gonna roll you away

Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living
Barely getting by, it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind, and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it

For service and devotion
You would think that I, would deserve a fat promotion
Want to move ahead, but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is

Tumble out of bed and stumble to the kitchen
