I see you there, a silhouette in the moonlight
Looks like you've given up on love
You used to be the face in the spotlight
Now loneliness fits you like a glove
You walk around in your cloak of darkness
Too blind to see the light
Your wings are broken, now your spirit can't take flight


You're not alone, you're not alone
While your heart's still young and free
You're not alone, pick up the phone
And talk to me, baby, you will see
You're not alone


Pools of sorrow and tears of joy
There's a broken-up girl for every broken-down boy
But you don't want to hear it
You like the rhythm of the blues
Want to be a sad story on the late-night news
I don't mean to burst your bubble
But the world's got troubles worse than you
And everybody else out here gets lonely too


You're not alone, you're not alone
I've been waiting patiently
No, you're not alone, pick up the phone
And talk to me, baby, you will see


Although your heart is in pieces
You can't find a reason to try
You're not alone, while I'm still standing by


You're not alone, you're not alone
While your heart's still young and free
You're not alone, pick up the phone
And talk to me, baby, you will see
You're not alone
