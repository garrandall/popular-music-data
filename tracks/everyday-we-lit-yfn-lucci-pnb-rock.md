I came up from nothing nigga you can't tell me shit yeah
Did it on my own, check out neck check my wrist yeah
I swear I ain't never expected it to be like this
Now a nigga gettin' rich I swear everyday we lit yeah
Everyday we lit yeah, you can't tell me shit yeah
'Member I was broke yeah, now I'm gettin' rich yeah
Yeah when yo' diamonds colder than a bitch, then you know you lit
When you quick to take a nigga bitch, then you know you lit
Everyday we lit yeah everyday we lit yeah
Everyday we lit yeah everyday we lit yeah
Everyday we lit everyday we lit
Everyday we lit yeah, everyday we lit


Can't wait to get that Vodka Ron
Put it on my arm
Just counted a 50 with my mom, the boy gone
All my cars came foreign, my chain glowin'
I ain't goin' man look where we came from
Uh all yo' bangers got my name on it
She want me to put my name on it
I got the hottest '16, one of the best you've ever seen
But she like it when I sing on it


I came up from nothing nigga you can't tell me shit yeah
Did it on my own, check out neck check my wrist yeah
I swear I ain't never expected it to be like this
Now a nigga gettin' rich I swear everyday we lit yeah
Everyday we lit yeah, you can't tell me shit yeah
'Member I was broke yeah, now I'm gettin' rich yeah
Yeah when yo' diamonds colder than a bitch, then you know you lit
When you quick to take a nigga bitch, then you know you lit
Everyday we lit yeah everyday we lit yeah
Everyday we lit yeah everyday we lit yeah
Everyday we lit everyday we lit
Everyday we lit yeah, everyday we lit


Can't wait to get that new drop
Put that on my block
I just copped a new B, put that on my Glock
I done stepped my game up, got my chains up
I swear on my niggas I won't never change up
Rollie all on my wrist, rollie all on my bitch
I ain't goin' back broke, now a nigga gettin' rich
I did it all on my own, and nobody gave me a loan
Now my diamonds on froze, now I'm fuckin' niggas' hoes


I came up from nothing nigga you can't tell me shit yeah
Did it on my own, check out neck check my wrist yeah
I swear I ain't never expected it to be like this
Now a nigga gettin' rich I swear everyday we lit yeah
Everyday we lit yeah, you can't tell me shit yeah
'Member I was broke yeah, now I'm gettin' rich yeah
Yeah when yo' diamonds colder than a bitch, then you know you lit
When you quick to take a nigga bitch, then you know you lit
