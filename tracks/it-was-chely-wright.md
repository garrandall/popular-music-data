I guess we guess our way through life
How many times do we really know for sure
I was just hoping for the best
Then I woke up in those loving arms of yours
What I felt was unmistakable
When I fell for you
Chorus!
It was real, it was magic
It was calm, it was savage
It was cool as a breeze it was warm to the touch
It was never enough, it was always too much
It did all the things love does
That's how I knew it was

Who thought that I could laugh so loud
Then turn around and cry so many tears?
I used to have so many doubts
But one by one you made them disappear
But what I found was unbelievable, I believe it's true

Chorus
It was real, it was magic
It was calm it was savage
It was cool as a breeze, it was warm to the touch
It was never enough, it was always too much
It did all the things love does
That's how I knew it was

You asked what I felt when you walked through the door
Was it fear, was it clear, it was all that and more

Chorus
It was real, it was magic
It was calm, it was savage
It was cool as a breeze it was warm to the touch
It was never enough, it was always too much
It did all the things love does
And that's how I knew it was
That's how I knew it was
It was

Mmmhmmm, it was
