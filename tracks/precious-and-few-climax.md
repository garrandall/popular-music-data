Precious and few are the moments we two can share
Quiet and blue like the sky, I'm hung over you
And if I can't find my way back home
It just wouldn't be fair
Precious and few are the moments we two can share

Baby, it's you on my mind, your love is so rare
Being with you is a feeling I just can't compare
And if I can't hold you in my arms
It just wouldn't be fair
'Cause precious and few are the moments we two can share

And if I can't find my way back home
Oh, it just wouldn't be fair
'Cause precious and few are the moments we two can share

Precious and few are the moments we two can share
Quiet and blue like the sky, I'm hung over you
And if I can't find my way back home
Oh, it just wouldn't be fair
'Cause precious and few are the moments we two can share
