You have a date for half past eight tonight
Some distant bell starts chimin' nine
You wanna see her
You wanna see her. oh yeah
So you wait, you wait and wait
Girl don't come

The time rolls on those minutes fly by
You wanna go but just you try guy
You wanna see her
You wanna see her, oh yeah
So you wait, you wait and wait
Girl don't come

You've been stood up
Tears fill your eyes oh whoa-oh
You hurt inside
You wanna die oh whoa

You have a date for half past eight tonight
Some distant bell starts chimin' nine
You wanna see her
You wanna see her, oh yeah
So you wait, you wait and wait
Girl don't come

You've been stood up
Tears fill your eyes oh whoa-oh
You hurt inside
You wanna die oh whoa
You wanna see her
You wanna see her oh yeah
So you wait, you wait and wait
Girl don't come
Girl don't come
Girl don't come
