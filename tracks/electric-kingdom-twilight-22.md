Huh, deep in the city people live in the streets
You got to be careful of everyone you meet
There's lootin' and shootin', people stabbin' and grabbin'
The innocent bystanders, the police are grabbin'

Ain't it a pity 'cause you hate the city
But the way you feel ain't no big deal
You've got to survive and that the real nitty gritty
You go uptown, downtown, you've got to turn your life around

Back in the jungle a man is free
Free from the street, from captivity
Break out, break in, it doesn't matter where you've been
Snake pit, lion's den, you need someone to be your friend

Come to Electric Kingdom
Truck to Electric Kingdom
Come to Electric Kingdom
Truck to Electric Kingdom

Electric
Electric
Electric
Electric

Give it to me, give it to me
(Give it to me, give it to me)
Give it any way you play
(Give it)

Sign in on the one, huh
Get up, get up, be on your way
On the one, huh

Electric Kingdom

Who you talkin' to?
Who you

Give it, take it
Give it, take it

Electric Kingdom

Who you talkin' to?
Who you?

Electric Kingdom
Electric Kingdom

Come to Electric Kingdom
Truck to Electric Kingdom
Come to Electric Kingdom
Truck to Electric Kingdom

Ain't it a pity 'cause you hate the city
But the way you feel ain't no big deal
You've got to survive and that the real nitty gritty
You go uptown, downtown, you've got to turn your life around, huh

Electric Kingdom
