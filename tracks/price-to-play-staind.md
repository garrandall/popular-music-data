Failed to see,
How destructive we can be.
Taking without giving back,
'Til the damage can be seen,
Can you see?
Can you see?

The more you take,
The more you blame,
But everything still feels the same.
The more you hurt,
The more you strain,
The price you pay to play the game,
Then all you see,
And all you gain,
And all you step on with no shame,
There are no rules,
No one to blame,
The price you pay to play the game.

Apathy, the chosen way to be,
Blindly look the other way,
While you waste away with me,
Can you see?
Can you see?

The more you take,
The more you blame,
But everything still feels the same.
The more you hurt,
The more you strain,
The price you pay to play the game,
Then all you see,
And all you gain,
And all you step on with no shame,
There are no rules,
No one to blame,
The price you pay to play the game.

What you pay to play the game,
What you pay to play the game,
What you pay to play the game,
What you pay to play the game.

The more you take,
The more you blame,
But everything still feels the same.
The more you hurt,
The more you strain,
The price you pay to play the game,
Then all you see,
And all you gain,
And all you step on with no shame,
There are no rules,
No one to blame,
The price you pay to play the game.

What you pay to play the game,
What you pay to play the game,
What you pay to play the game,
What you pay to play the game.
