Secret, I know a secret
A story I'll never tell
About two sweethearts
Who love each other
He is my best friend
She is his girl

The first time I saw her
I couldn't resist her
Her beauty gave me a thrill
She was so lovely
And I adored her
I fell in love with
My best friend's girl

And that's my secret
Yes, it's my secret
Nobody knows it
No one but I
And I will love her
Yes, I will love her
And it's my secret
Until I die
