Heaven ablaze in our eyes
We're standing still in time
The blood on our hands is the wine
We offer as sacrifice


Come on and show them your love
Rip out the wings of a butterfly
For your soul, my love
Rip out the wings of a butterfly
For your soul


This endless mercy mile
We're crawling side by side
With hell freezing over in our eyes
Gods kneel before our crime




(Rip out the wings of a butterfly)
Donâ€™t let go
(Rip out the wings of a butterfly)
For your soul
