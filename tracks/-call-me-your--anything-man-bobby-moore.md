If you want super satisfaction
Well, I'm the one
And I can give and bring on

Quick action and lots of fun

The kind of love

Love that is lasting

Hey, you can have it

If you want it
If you want it
You can keep it, hey, baby


Call me, call me
Your anything man

I'll do anything you want me to
Just call me, call me
Your anything man


(I'll be what you want)
(I'll be what you need)


I'll make you, make you
The main attraction of my life

Yes, I will, girl

And every day

There'll be something different
And something nice
I ain't lying


Just say the word
That you are willing


And then you can have it
If you want it

If you want it
You can keep it, hey, baby


Call me, call me
Your anything man
(I'll be what you want)

(I'll be what you need)
I'll do anything you want me to now


Now call me, call me
Your anything man
(I'll be what you want)

(I'll be what you need)
Call me mister fix it, babe
Now call me, call me (call me)


(Call me, call me)
(I'll be what you want)

(I'll be what you need)

Ooh, baby, call me

And I'll make you the
Main attraction of my life
(I'll be what you want)

Yes, I will, girl
(I'll be what you need)


Hey, baby, call me
Super satisfaction guaranteed
(I'll be what you want)

(I'll be what you need)

Hey, yeah, call me

I want to wrap my love around you
Baby, yeah
(I'll be what you want) ooh, baby

(I'll be what you need)
