We (We) hold the key (Hold the key)
To the world's (The world's) destiny (Destiny)

Have you the feeling to shine your light
Usin' the power, shinin' bright
Years we've been searchin', born to be


All the good thing discovers, we're able to see
Your heart's a fire, create for you, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Love and desire, hearts of two
Mmm mmm mmm ooh hoo ooh ooh ooh

Think it over (Yeah), ooh
Life ain't a four leaf clover, (Oh, no it ain't) ooh
Think it over (Brother), ooh
Life ain't a four leaf clover, ooh (Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh )

Love is a flower, from that a bud
To spread its sunshine and make us love
Beautiful colors shinin' though
 Bless you, brother,  God is watching you, woo

Think it over (Oh, ho, ho), ooh
Life ain't a four leaf clover (No-no-no-no-no-no-no), ooh
Think it over (You better), ooh
Life ain't a four leaf clover (Mmm mmm mmm mmm ), ooh

Love is a flower, let it shine on through
All you know where it's comin' from, God is watchin' you, oh, yes, He is
Oh, listen, this is the tower
Let that flower bloom all over you, you, you, you, ooh ooh

We hold the key (Brothers)
To the world's (Come together and love) destiny
(You see, it's like a flower sent from above)
We (Let that flower bloom) hold the key (All over you and me)
To the world's (All over the world) destiny
(Do you know what I mean, woo, woo, woo, woo, ooh woo )

Woo woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo ooh
Whoa, whoa
