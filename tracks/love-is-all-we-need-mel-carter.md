Love is all we need
So won't you take me
In your arms and love me
Love me

Love is all we need
So, darling, press me
To your heart and love me
Love me

Tell me we'll
Always have each other
Cause that's all I
Ever want to know

Tell me you'll always be my lover
Cause I will always want you so

Love is all we need
So, darling, hold me
Close to you and love me
Love me

All we ever, ever need is love

Love is all we need
So, darling, hold me
Close to you and love me
Love me

All we ever, ever need is love
All we ever need is love
All we ever need is love
