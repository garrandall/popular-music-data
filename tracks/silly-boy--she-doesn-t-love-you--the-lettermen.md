Silly boy, silly boy, she doesn't care
Silly boy, silly boy, she's not playing fair
She doesn't love you, go and find someone new
And don't be a fool, silly boy

It's over and done, so you say
Can't believe our love could end this way
Someone else is playing my part
And here's what I'm telling my heart

Silly boy, silly boy, she doesn't care
Silly boy, silly boy, she's not playing fair
She doesn't love you, go and find someone new
And don't be a fool, silly boy

Be a man and don't lose your pride
Keep the tears and pain locked inside
I keep saying these things, but I know
In my heart I still love her so

Silly boy, silly boy, she doesn't care
Silly boy, silly boy, she's not playing fair
She doesn't love you, go and find someone new
And don't be a fool, silly boy

Silly boy, silly boy, don't be a fool
Silly boy, silly boy, she doesn't care
Silly boy
