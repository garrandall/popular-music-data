You complete me
Like air and water boy, I need thee
And when I'm in your arms I feel free
Fallen
My head’s up in the clouds in love
I'm proud to you say it loud
Like an accident it happened
Out of nowhere it just happened
And I ain’t mad at all
Because I’ve…


Fallen, head over heels
I've fallen in love with you
I've fallen, and I can't get up
Don't wanna get up because of love
Fallen, head over heels
I've fallen in love with you
I've fallen, and I can't get up
Don't wanna get up because of love


Baby
To let you get away is crazy
So I'm doing what it takes
To make you pledge your love to me
You see, cause I'm tryna be your lady
For ever and ever baby
The picture wouldn't be the same
If you weren't standing next to me
Can't you see I'm fallen?


Fallen, head over heels
I've fallen in love with you
I've fallen, and I can't get up
Don't wanna get up because of love
Fallen, head over heels
I've fallen in love with you
I've fallen, and I can't get up
Don't wanna get up because of love


You complement me, not an accessory
You're necessary (you never could speak bad words against me)
Your bare with me (security)
Are you here with me?
You’re my happiness, my joy
And it’s all because of you boy
I look forward to the time I spend with you
Whatever it is we do

Cause I'm fallen for you boy
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Fallen, I've fallen for you
Fallen, head over heels for you
So in love with you, fallen
For you


Touch me (touch me)
Hold me (hold me)
Love me (love me)
Kiss me (in love with you)
Talk to me (talk to me)
Caress me (oh)
Play with me (don't wanna get up)
Explore me (you’re my everything)


Fallen, head over heels
I've fallen in love with you
I've fallen, and I can't get up
Don't wanna get up because of love
Fallen, head over heels
I've fallen in love with you
I've fallen, and I can't get up
Don't wanna get up because of love
Fallen, head over heels
I've fallen in love with you
I've fallen, and I can't get up
Don't wanna get up because of love
Fallen, head over heels
I've fallen in love with you
I've fallen, and I can't get up
Don't wanna get up because of love
