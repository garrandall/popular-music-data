Tell me where does the lovin' go
When it's gone away
Tell me when does the heartache end
Or is it bound to stay

I always thought that we would last forever
A love that never, ever would be ending
But now I see it isn't meant to be
And I've got to stop pretending

Tell me where are all the dreams
That we used to share
Are they lost to some other time
Will they still be there

I can't believe that my place could be taken
My heart so easy breakin' up inside
'Cause after all this time, I thought of you as mine
And it's hard to let go, my heart says no

And I never knew we were losing touch
I didn't think we could change so much
Don't take your leave of me just yet
Smile for me once more, so I won't forget

Tell me where is another chance
Like the one we knew
And tell me where can I find someone
Someone just like you

I can't imagine what I'm gonna do
'Cause I've lived my life for you and all we've planned
And I don't think I'll ever understand
Where does the lovin' go
