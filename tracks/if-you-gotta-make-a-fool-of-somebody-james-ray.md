If you gotta make a fool of somebody
If you gotta make a fool of someone...

Sure you haven't got the wrong number
Sure it's me you want to talk to tonight
Everyone in town's got your number
Everyone's got you pegged right

Is that why (If you gotta make a fool...)
You got in touch with me
(If you gotta make a fool...)
I guess you must be
(Why you hurt me so, hurt me so)
Running out of fools

When you left me there crying (You fool, you fool)
Your goodbyes were ever colder than ice
It didn't bother you I was crying
Now you want to break my heart twice
Is that why (If you gotta make a fool...)
You got in touch with me
(Darling you know)
I guess you must be
Running out, running out of fools

Guess you got back to my name in your little black book
(Daytime, nighttime, any time at all)
Hey, I tell you what, I bet you forgot how I even look
So go ahead with all your sweet talking
Go ahead for all the good it's gonna do
You had yourself a dime's worth of talking
Then I'm gonna hang up on you

Cause this time (If you gotta make a fool...)
You're not getting through to me (Darling you know)
I guess you must be running out of fools
Running out of fools
Even a fool like me

If you gotta make a fool of somebody
If you gotta make a fool of someone
Tell me, tell me why did you hurt me
'Cos I'm the one who loves you
Yes, I am
I'm the one who's gonna be right here when you do me wrong
Yes I am, I ain't goin' nowhere
'Cos I love you and I'm a fool for you, baby
