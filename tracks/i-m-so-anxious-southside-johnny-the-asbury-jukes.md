(B. Rush)

Won't you come to Florida for a vacation?
The tan developer beckons from the television
They know they got me because I'm an insomniac
Records, detergents, here's the latest Pontiac
The got me so conditioned now that
When they talk I just react
Why they throwing it all at me?

I'm so
I'm so
I'm so anxious

Hard sell pressure got to keep the motor running
Stimulate your need to satisfy something
You don't want to be the one who never gets in line
You don't want to be the one who's always left behind
Pick up that phone you're running out of time
Why they throwing it all at me?

I'm so
I'm so
I'm so anxious

I'm so
I'm so
I'm so anxious

I know you're worrying what will the people say?
I know you're worrying you've got bills to pay
Worrying will the backwash get you?
The undertow drag you out?

You don't want to be the one who never gets in line
You don't want to be the one who's always left behind
Pick up that phone, quick you're running out of time
Why they throwing it all at me?
Why they throwing it all at me?
Why they throwing it all at me?

I'm so
I'm so
I'm so anxious

I'm so
I'm so
I'm so anxious
