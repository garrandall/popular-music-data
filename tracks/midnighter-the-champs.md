I was walking down the avenue and my hart wanted something unknown(new)
I felt like saying good day to anybody
To anybody and that was you, and I said something (anything)
It was enough to me to talk to you to make you mine

At Champs ÃlysÃ©es, at Champs ÃlysÃ©es
If it's raining or if sun is shining, if it's noon or midnight
You have anything you want at Champs ÃlysÃ©es

You told me "I have a meeting in the basement with the fools
who live with guitars in their hands from evening till morning"
So I joined you, we sang and we danced
But we never even thought of kissing or hugging.

At Champs ÃlysÃ©es, at Champs ÃlysÃ©es
If it's raining or if sun is shining, if it's noon or midnight
You have anything you want at Champs ÃlysÃ©es
