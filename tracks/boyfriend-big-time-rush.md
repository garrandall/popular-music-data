Your boy boy b-b-boy-b-b-boyfriend
Your boy boy b-b-boy-b-b-boyfriend
Your boy boy b-b-boy-b-b-boyfriend
Your boy boy b-b-boy-b-b-boy...

Have you ever had the feeling you're drawn to someone?
And it isn't anything they could've said or done?
And everyday I see you on your own
And I can't believe that you're alone
But I overheard your girls and this is what they said

Looking for a
Looking for a
That you're looking for a boyfriend
I see that
Give me time, you know I'm gonna be that
Don't be scared to come put your trust in me
Can't you see all I really wanna be
Is your boyfriend
Can't fight that
Let me down you know I'm coming right back
I don't care at all what you've done before
All I really want is to be your

Your boy boy b-b-boy-b-b-boyfriend
Your boy boy b-b-boy-b-b-boyfriend
Your boy boy b-b-boy-b-b-boyfriend
Your boy boy b-b-boy-b-b-boyfriend

Let me take a little moment to find the right words
(To find the right words)
So when I kick it to you it ain't something that you've heard
(Something that you've heard)
I don't know what kind of guy that you prefer
But I know I gotta put myself for worse
See I think you got the kind of love that you deserve
And I heard that

You're looking for a boyfriend
I see that
Give me time, you know I'm gonna be that
Don't be scared to come put your trust in me
Can't you see all I really wanna be
Is your boyfriend
Can't fight that
Let me down you know I'm coming right back
I don't care at all what you've done before
All I really want is to be your

Your boy boy b-b-boy-b-b-boyfriend
Your boy boy b-b-boy-b-b-boyfriend
Your boy boy b-b-boy-b-b-boyfriend
Your boy boy b-b-boy-b-b-boyfriend

If you tell me where, I'm waiting here
Everyday like slum-dog millionaire
Bigger than the twilight love affair
I'll be here girl I swear

Looking for a
Looking for a
That you're looking for a boyfriend
I see that
Give me time, you know I'm gonna be that
Don't be scared to come put your trust in me
Can't you see all I really wanna be
Is your boyfriend
Can't fight that
Let me down you know I'm coming right back
I don't care at all what you've done before
All I really want is to be your

Your boy boy b-b-boy-b-b-boyfriend
Your boy boy b-b-boy-b-b-boyfriend
(Your boyfriend)
Your boy boy b-b-boy-b-b-boyfriend
(Your boyfriend)
Your boy boy b-b-boy-b-b-boyfriend
(All I really want is to be your)

Your boy boy b-b-boy-b-b-boyfriend
Your boy boy b-b-boy-b-b-boyfriend
Your boy boy b-b-boy-b-b-boyfriend
(All I really want is to be your)
Your boy boy b-b-boy-b-b-boyfriend

Your boy boy b-b-boy-b-b-boyfriend
Your boy boy b-b-boy-b-b-boyfriend
Your boy boy b-b-boy-b-b-boyfriend

All I really want is to be your...
