Kentucky woman
She shines with her own kind of light
She'd look at you once
And a day that's all wrong looks all right
And I love her, God knows, I love her

Kentucky woman
If she get to know you
She goin' to own you
Kentucky woman

Well, she ain't the kind makes heads turn
At the drop of her name
But something inside that she's got
Turns you on just the same
And she loves me
God knows, she loves me

Kentucky woman
If she get to know you
She goin' to own you
Kentucky woman

I don't want much
The good Lord's earth beneath my feet
A gentle touch
From that one girl
And life is sweet and good
Ain't no doubt, I'm talkin' about ...

Kentucky woman
If she get to know you
She goin' to own you
Kentucky woman

I don't want much
The good Lord's earth beneath my feet
A gentle touch
From that one girl
And life is sweet and good
Ain't no doubt
I'm talkin' about Kentucky woman
If she get to know you
She goin' to own you
Kentucky woman
Kentucky Woman
Kentucky Woman
