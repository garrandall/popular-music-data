In times when you're troubled
Seems more than you can afford
And you feel you need a friend
Someone to share the load

When your sky grows cloudy
I want you to know
You got a friend that's true

(CHORUS)
Just like a shelter
In the time of storm
I'll see you through
That's what I'll do

If your dreams are scattered
Just like the wind blown sand
And you feel, you feel like
You need a friend, I'll be there
Reach out your hands

And when the rain starts to fall
I'll be there, just to hold on to

(CHORUS)
Just like a shelter
In the time of storm
I'll see you through
That's what I'll do

(I will see you through)
(I will see you through)
(I will see you through)
(I will see you through)
(I will see you through)
(I will see you through)
(I will see you through)
(I will see you through)

I'll see you through your hangups
I'll see you through your fears
I'll see you through sad times
Honey, I'll dry all your tears

And when the tempest is raging
I want you to know
You got a friend that's true

(CHORUS) 4X

(I will see you through)
(I will see you through)
