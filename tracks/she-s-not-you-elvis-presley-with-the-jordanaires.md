Her hair is soft and her eyes are oh so blue
She's all the things a girl should be,
But she's not you.

She knows just how to make me laugh when I feel blue
She's ev'rything a man could want,
But she's not you.

And when we're dancing
It almost feels the same
I've got to stop myself from
Whisp'ring your name

She even kisses me like you used to do.
And it's just breaking my heart
Cause she's not you.

And it's just breaking my heart
Cause she's not you

And when we're dancing
It almost feels the same
I've got to stop myself from
Whisp'ring your name

She even kisses me like you used to do.
And it's just breaking my heart
Cause she's not you.
