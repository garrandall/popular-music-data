In the chilly hours and minutes of uncertainty
I long to be in the warm halls of your love and mine
To feel you all around me
To take your hand and walk along the sand 
Oh, but I may as well try and catch the wind

When sundown pales the sky I want to hide a while behind your smile
And everywhere I look your eyes I find
For me to love you now
Would be the sweetest thing, oh, it would make me sing
Yeah, but I may as well try and catch the wind, oh yeah

I'm gonna catch that wind
Help me catch the wind
All for you, babe
Just for you baby

When rain has hung the leaves with tears, I want you near to kill my fear
Help me to leave my blues behind
For standing inside your heart
Where I want to be, oh, I long to be
Oh, but I may as well try and catch the wind

I'll try and catch the wind
I'm gonna try, oh, to catch the wind
Feel your arms around me
Oh, all around me, all around me, all around me
Oh, but I want you, baby, yeah

Oh, I want to say
Oh, help me catch that wind
I'll catch the wind, I'll catch the wind, I'll catch the wind
Oh, yes I will
Oh, yes I will
