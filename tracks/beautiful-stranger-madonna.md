Haven't we met?
You're some kind of beautiful stranger
You could be good for me
I've had the taste for danger
If I'm smart then I'll run away
But I'm not so I guess I'll stay
Heaven forbid
I'll take my chance on a beautiful stranger


I looked into your eyes
And my world came tumbling down
You're the devil in disguise
That's why I'm singing this song
To know you is to love you


You're everywhere I go
And everybody knows
To love you is to be part of you
I've paid for you with tears
And swallowed all my pride


Da-da-da da-da-da-da da da-da, dum
Beautiful stranger
Da-da-da da-da-da-da da da-da, dum
Beautiful stranger


If I'm smart then I'll run away
But I'm not so I guess I'll stay
Haven't you heard?
I fell in love with a beautiful stranger


I looked into your face
My heart was dancing all over the place
I'd like to change my point of view
If I could just forget about you


To know you is to love you
You're everywhere I go
And everybody knows


I looked into your eyes
And my world came tumbling down
You're the devil in disguise
That's why I'm singing this song to you
To know you is to love you


You're everywhere I go
And everybody knows
I've paid for you with tears
And swallowed all my pride


Da-da-da da-da-da-da da da-da, dum
Beautiful stranger
Da-da-da da-da-da-da da da-da, dum
Beautiful stranger
