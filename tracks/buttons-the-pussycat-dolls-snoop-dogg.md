Yeah, little mama you lookin' good
I see you wanna play with a player from the hood
Come holla at me, you got it like that
Big Snoop Dogg, with the lead Pussycat
I show you how it go down, yeah, I wanna go down
Me and you, one on one, treat you like a shorty
You look at me and I look at you
I'm reachin' for your shirt what you want me to do


I'm telling you to loosen up my buttons baby (Uh huh)
But you keep frontin' (Uh)
Saying what you gon' do to me (Uh Huh)
But I ain't seen nothing (Uh)

I''m telling you to loosen up my buttons baby (Uh huh)
But you keep frontin' (Uh)
Saying what you gon' do to me (Uh huh)


Typical
Hardly the type I fall for
I like when the physical
Don't leave me asking for more
I'm a sexy mama (Mama)
Who knows just how to get what I wanna (Wanna)
What I want to do is spring this on ya (On ya)
Back up all of the things that I told ya (Told ya, told ya, told ya)

You been sayin' all the right things all night long
But I can't seem to get you over here to help take this off
Baby, can't you see? (See)
How these clothes are fittin' on me? (Me)
And the heat coming from this beat (Beat)
I'm about to blow
I don't think you know


I'm tellin' you to loosen up my buttons baby (Uh huh)
But you keep frontin' (Uh)
Saying what you gon' do to me (Uh huh)
But I ain't seen nothing (Uh)

I'm telling you to loosen up my buttons baby (Uh huh)
But you keep frontin' (Uh)
Saying what you gon' do  to me(Uh huh)
But I ain't seen nothing (Uh huh)


You say you're a big boy
But I can't agree
'Cause the love you said you had
Ain't been put on me
I wonder (Wonder)
If I'm just too much for you
Wonder (Wonder)
If my kiss don't make you just
Wonder (Wonder)
What I got next for you
What you want to do? (Do)

Take a chance to recognize that this could be yours
I can see, just like most guys, that your game don't please
Baby, can't you see? (See)
How these clothes are fittin' on me? (Me)
And the heat coming from this beat (Beat)
I'm about to blow
I don't think you know


I'm tellin' you to loosen up my buttons baby (Uh huh)
But you keep frontin' (Uh)
Saying what you gon' do to me (Uh huh)
But I ain't seen nothing (Uh)

I'm tellin' you to loosen up my buttons baby (Uh huh)
But you keep frontin' (Uh)
Saying what you gon' do to me (Uh huh)

But I need what I need
And let me tell you what's crackalackin' before I proceed
Ima show you where to put it at
