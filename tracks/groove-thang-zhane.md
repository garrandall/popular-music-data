Well, its a groove thang, it's gotta funky swing
Well, it's a groove thang, a groove thang

Come on

We're moving on, keeping strong
Don't you let them steer you wrong
It's a groove thang

We're gonna give you what you want
Just as long as you're around
It's a groove thang

We're moving on, keeping strong
Don't you let them steer you wrong
It's a groove thang

We're gonna give you what you want
Just as long as you're around
It's a groove thang

Oh yeah, ah

People, there's really nothing to it
Let your mind rest, my friend, and do it
Remember, it ain't over 'til it's really over
A groove thang, groove thang

Relax your mind, listen to the rhythm
It's got you flowing but it's in precision
Music is life and we are living
Groove thang, groove thang, groove thang

We're moving on, keeping strong
Don't you let them steer you wrong
It's a groove thang

We're gonna give you what you want
Just as long as you're around
It's a groove thang

Oh yeah
Oh yeah

It's gonna make you touch the sky
Your body's moving left to right
You're grooving to the morning light
It's a groove thang

Oh yeah

It takes some time to realize
Your body's moving left to right
The feeling's, oh, so dynamite
It's a groove thang

So whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do
Keep your body move, moving
So whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do
Keep your body move, moving

Party, people, it's a silky fun and groove a thang
Party, people, it's a silky fun and groove a thang

Oh yeah

We're moving on, keeping strong
Don't you let them steer you wrong
It's a groove thang

We're gonna give you what you want
Just as long as you're around
It's a groove thang

We're moving on, keeping strong
Don't you let them steer you wrong
It's a groove thang

We're gonna give you what you want
Just as long as you're around
It's a groove thang, yeah
