Every day, it's a-getting closer, going faster than a roller coaster.
Love like yours will surely come my way.
Every day, it's a-getting faster, everyone says go ahead and ask her.
love like yours will surely come my way.

Every day seems a little longer, in every way my love's a little stronger.
Come what may, do you ever long for true love from me?

Every day, it's a-getting closer, going faster than a roller coaster.
Love like yours will surely come my way.
Every day, it's a-getting faster, everyone says go ahead and ask her.
love like yours will surely come my way.

Every day seems a little longer, in every way my love's a little stronger.
Come what may, do you ever long for true love from me?

Every day, it's a-getting closer, going faster than a roller coaster.
Love like yours will surely come my way.
Love like ours will surely be here to stay.
