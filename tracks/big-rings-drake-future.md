Yeah, I know we just signed a deal but
I need my advance on the next one too
They know I'ma be around
Yeah, I need it


'Cause I got a really big team
And they need some really big rings
They need some really nice things
Better be comin' with no strings
Better be comin' with no strings
We need some really nice things
We need some really big rings
I got a really big team
I got a really big team
They need some really big rings
They need some really nice things
Better be comin' with no strings
Better be comin' with no strings
We need some really nice things
We need some really big rings
I got a really big team


Man, what a time to be alive
You and yours vs. me and mine
Are we talkin' teams? Are we talkin' teams?
Oh, you switchin' sides? Wanna come with me?
Look at the smile on me, look at the owl on me
I do not chase girls, but they run a mile for me
Say she gon' ride for me, I'll buy the tires for you
This game is different
You only get one shot when niggas gon' foul on you
Man, fuck 'em all, man, we want it all
Don't get too involved, we gon' knock ya off
And to top it off, I'm with all the dogs
It's a new season and we still breathin'


And I got a really big team
And they need some really big rings
They need some really nice things
Better be comin' with no strings
Better be comin' with no strings
We need some really nice things
We need some really big rings
I got a really big team
I got a really big team
They need some really big rings
They need some really nice things
Better be comin' with no strings
Better be comin' with no strings
We need some really nice things
We need some really big rings
I got a really big team


Man, what a time to be alive
I'm drinkin' lean, they thought I died
I run with kidnappers, I'm talkin' 'bout kidnappers
I'm talkin' 'bout murderin' niggas, I'm talkin' 'bout carjackers
You just a battle rapper, I'm an official trapper
Niggas be droppin' subliminals, nigga
That just some jibber jabber
We take a Mellow Yellow then fill it with red forever-ever
These niggas so jelly, jealous
Man, these niggas get scared, they telli'-tellin'
I fuck a check up on everything
I bought some ice when the feds came
I bought that bitch new Celine, I got rings, I got racks like Serena
All of my rings Aquafina, my bitch Aquafina
Pluto and Jupiter, I go to Venus
I'm fresh out the store but I'm not out the cleaners
Who keepin' score 'cause these niggas, they losin'


'Cause I got a really big team
And they need some really big rings
They need some really nice things
Better be comin' with no strings
Better be comin' with no strings
We need some really nice things
We need some really big rings
I got a really big team
I got a really big team
They need some really big rings
They need some really nice things
Better be comin' with no strings
Better be comin' with no strings
We need some really nice things
We need some really big rings
I got a really big team


Man, what a time...
