(Day in) Day in
(Day out) Day out
(Stay in) Stay in
(Fade out) Fade out
(Day in) Hoo hoo
(Day out) Oh hoo hoo


She was born in a handbag
Love left
On a doorstep
What she lacks is a backup
Nothing seems to make a dent
Going to find her some money, honey
Try to pay her rent
That's the kind of protection everyone is shouting about
(Hey, hey)


(Day in) Day in
(Day out) Day out
(Stay in) Stay in
(Fade out) Fade out
(Day in) Hoo hoo
(Day out) Oh hoo hoo


First thing she learns is
She's a citizen
Some things they turn out right
When you're under the USA
Someone rings a bell
And it's all over
She's going out of her way
Stealing for that one good rush
(Ah)


(Day in) Day in
(Day out) Day out
(Stay in) Stay in
(Fade out) Fade out
(Day in) Hoo hoo
(Day out) Oh hoo hoo


She could use a little money
She's hanging on his arms
Like a cheap suit
She's got no money, honey
She's on the other side
Oh come on little baby
Late night, big town
Police, shake down


Day in
Day out
Stay in
Fade out
Hoo hoo

(Day in)
(Day out)
(Stay in)
(Fade out)


(Day in) She's got a ticket to nowhere
(Day out) She's going to take a train ride
(Stay in) Nobody knows her, or knows her name
(Stay out) She's in the pocket of a home boy
(Stay in) Oh she's going to take her a shotgun, pow
(Stay out) Spin the grail spin the drug
(Stay in) She's going to make them well aware
(Stay out) She's an angry girl
(All over)


(Day in) Day in
(Day out) Day out
(Stay in) Stay in
(Fade out) (Fade out) Fade out


(Day in) And there's angels everywhere
(Day out) Suddenly shooting her down
(Day in) Shooting her with video, drugs, bullets, and promises
(Day out) Angels in a ton of sound... And it'sâ€”
(Day in) Day in
(Day out) Day out
(Day in) You stay in, or ya...
(Day out) Ya fade out, fade out
(Day in) Fade out
(Day out) Ha, and ya...
(Day in) Fade out
(Day out) Fade out, fade out
(Day in) Hoo hoo
(Day out) Oh hoo hoo
(Day in)
(Day out) (Day out)
(Day in) (Day in)
(Day out) (Day out)
(Day in) Hoo hoo
