I need a saving grace
A hiding place
I don't have forever or time to waste
So don't let me be lonely
I wanna shake this winter coat off my sleeve
Dust off a record and just be free
Oh, don't let me be lonely
No, don't let me be lonely


When you're young
You can fly
But we trip on clouds 'cause we get too high
And we grow up
And then it's gone
Oh God only knows what we'll become


So don't let me be, let me be, let me be lonely tonight
While we're young and alive
Take the keys to my car and the keys to my heart and just drive
Oh, don't let me, let me be lonely
Oh


Well, the night rolls on like a long lost friend
'Til the sunrise bleeds like the bitter end
Don't let me be lonely
Well, there's nothing to hide and nothing to prove
Give me all that you are
You've got nothing to lose
Just don't let me be lonely (Let me be lonely)
No, don't let me be lonely


So don't let me be, let me be, let me be lonely tonight
While we're young and alive
Take the keys to my car and the keys to my heart and just drive
Oh, don't let me, let me be lonely
No, don't let me be


When you're young
Life's a dream
It's a beautiful and a burning thing
We grow up
And then it's gone
But the memory goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on


Don't let me be, let me be, let me be lonely tonight
While we're young and alive
Take the keys to my car and the keys to my heart and just drive
Oh, don't let me, let me be lonely
Don't let me be lonely (Let me be lonely)
Don't, don't let me be lonely (Let me be lonely)
Oh, no, don't let me be
Oh, oh, lonely
