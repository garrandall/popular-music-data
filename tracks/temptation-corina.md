Baby, there's something I think you should know
(Baby)
I don't think I'll be needing you anymore
It's just one of those things
I'm sure you'll understand

We've been together so long
I never meant to do you wrong
But I've found someone new
There's nothing you can say or do
To try and change my mind
Would be a waste of time
Let's go our separate ways
There's nothing more to say

Just try to ease your mind
'Cause I don't mean to hurt you
It's just he's knows to treat me like a special lady
It's time you look away
He's knows just how to touch me
Maybe someday you'll understand

Temptation is a part of life
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
Temptation is a part of life
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
It makes you do what you love

He's knows I can't resist
Ooh, his perfect lips
When he looks in my eyes
I feel like I've been hypnotized
I've wanted him for so long
What I felt was oh so strong
In time feelings changed
Things were not the same

Just try to ease your mind
'Cause I don't mean to hurt you
It's just he's knows to treat me like a special lady
It's time you look away
He's knows just how to touch me
Maybe someday you'll understand

Temptation is a part of life
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
Temptation is a part of life
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
Temptation is a part of life
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
Temptation is a part of life
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
It makes you do what you love

(Temptation)
(Temptation)

Temptation is a part of life
(Temptation, yeah)
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
(It doesn't matter, baby)
Temptation is a part of life
(It doesn't matter, baby, no, no)
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
(If it's wrong or right)
Temptation is a part of life
(Temptation)
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
(It doesn't matter, no)
Temptation is a part of life
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
It makes you do what you love
