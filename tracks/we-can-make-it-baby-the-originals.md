(Oh baby)
Haven't got much to give
(Hey babe)
And don't know what I'll get
(Oh, I know)
All I know
Is if you love me
(Oh, hey)
We can make it babe
(We can make it if we try, we can make it)
Oh darlin'
(Just rely on me, oh baby)

I know things have been rough
(Hey baby)
And sometimes, little girl, the going gets tough
(Oh, I know)
But I know if you stay with me, oh baby
(Oh hey, hey, hey)
We can make it baby
(We can make it if we try, we can make it)
I know we can
(Just rely on me, we can make it, oh yes we can)

One day I'll give you all the things you deserve
You have my word
Just love me
(Love me)
And stay with me
(Love me baby)

Don't let some sweet talkin' guy with his bread turn your head
'Cause girl, without you, love, my soul might as well be dead
(Oh baby)
Sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar
(Hey baby)
For as long as I live
(Oh, I know)
All, all I know is if you love me
(Oh hey, hey, hey)
We can make it baby
(We can make it if we try, we can make it)
Oh, we can make it
(Just rely on me, we can make it)

Oh
(We can make it)
Oh
(We can make it)
Oh
(We can make it)
