Boogie - ah, you sexy, sexy (boogie child)
Boogie - the situation wrecks me
Boogie - I can't stand the way you do it (boogie child)
Boogie - bad girl don't put me through it
Boogie - right to the limit (boogie child)
Boogie - you're a bad girl you got me in it
Boogie - a man could die for the way I'm thinking (boogie child)
Boogie - and I'm in too deep and I just keep sinking

When you move it like you really know how to move me
I follow you wherever you go
I just wanna lay my love on you - that boogie child she can
Boogie - oh, you sexy, sexy (boogie child)
Boogie - the situation wrecks me
Boogie - I can't stand the way you do it (boogie child)
Boogie - bad girl don't put me through it (come on boogie, boogie)

Oh, boogie child, she's honey-sweet
She got a hungry love, it's good enough to eat
You can't touch her cos you know she's mine
Come on boogie child let your love-light shine
I just wanna lay my love on you - that boogie child she can

Boogie - ah, you sexy, sexy (boogie child)
Boogie - the situation wrecks me
Boogie - I can't stand the way you do it (boogie child)
Boogie - bad girl don't put me through it
You can't touch her cos you know she's mine
Come on boogie child let your love light shine
I just wanna lay my love on you - that boogie child she can

Boogie - oh, you sexy, sexy (boogie child)
Boogie - the situation wrecks me
Boogie - I can't stand the way you do it (boogie child)
Boogie - bad girl don't put me through it
Boogie - oh, right to the limit
Boogie - bad girl you got me in it (come on boogie, boogie)
Boogie - a man should die for the way I'm
For the way I'm thinking (boogie child)
Boogie - and I'm in too deep and I just keep sinking

Boogie - boogie child (come on boogie, boogie)
Boogie - boogie child (come on boogie, boogie)
