Oh, I bet you're wond'rin' how I knew
Baby, baby, baby, 'bout your plans to make me blue
With some other girl you knew before
Between the two of us girls ya know I love you more
It took me by surprise I must say
When I found out yesterday

Don't ya know that I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, don't ya know that I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about, just about, just about, to lose my mind
Oh yes, I am, Oh yes, I am, Oh yes, I am

Baby won't you listen to me

Boy take a good look at these tears of mine
Baby, baby these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life you see
Because you mean that much to me
You could've told me yourself
That you love some body else

Instead I heard it through the grapevine
Oh-h, not much longer you be mine
Oh, I heard it, yes, I heard it
Oh, just about, just about, just about, to lose my mind
Oh yes, I am, Oh yes, I am, Oh yes, I am

Go-o-o-o-o, go
Go, I gotta go
Go, go
You gotta let me go
Go, go, go
I gotta go whoa, whoa, whoa

Say believe half of what you see
Oh, ho, and none of what you hear
Baby, but I just can't help bein' confused
If it's true please baby, won't ya tell me dear
Oh-h-h, do you plan to let me go
For the other girl you loved before?
Don't ya know that I heard through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Don't ya know that I heard it, yes I heard it
