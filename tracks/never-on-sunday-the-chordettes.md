Oh, you can kiss me on a Monday
A Monday, a Monday is very very good
Or you can kiss me on a Tuesday
A Tuesday, a Tuesday in fact I wish you would

Or you can kiss me on a Wednesday a Thursday
A Friday and Saturday is best
But never ever on a Sunday, a Sunday, a Sunday
'Cause that's my day of rest

Most any day you can be my guest
Any day you say but my day of rest
Just name the day that you like the best
Only stay away on my day of rest

Oh, you can kiss me on a cool day, a hot day, a wet day
Which ever one you choose
Or try to kiss me on a gray day, a May day, a pay day
And see if I refuse

And if you make it on a bleake day, a freak day, or a week day
Well, you can be my guest
But never ever on a Sunday, a Sunday the one day I need a little rest
Oh, you can kiss me on a week day, a week day, a week day
The day to be my guest
