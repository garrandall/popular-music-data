Because I still get a thrill thinking of you
And I still feel your lips kissing me too
Although our love affair wasn't to be
I wonder if you care care about me

I still remember that night under the moon
I recall that it all ended too soon
I can't believe you're gone memories linger on
'Cause I still get a thrill thinking of you

'Cause I still get a thrill thinking of you
And I still feel your lips kissing me too
I can't believe no I can't believe you're gone memories linger they linger on
'Cause I still get a thrill thinking of you
'Cause I still get a thrill thinking of you
