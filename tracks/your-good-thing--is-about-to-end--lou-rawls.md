I don't have to beg you to hold me
'Cause somebody else will
You don't have to love me, when I want it
'Cause somebody else will

You're so called friends say you don't need it
But all the time they're trying to get it

I said, you better look out
Your good thing's about to come to an end
Yeah, baby, I'm talkin' about your real good thing's
About to come to an end

All those nights I watched the four walls
I didn't have to watch them all alone
Whenever someone said, they wanted me
I didn't have to tell them, I was your very own

You have all the love I've got, baby
And even ice melts to water when gets hot

Hey, you better look out
Your good thing's about to come to an end
Baby, baby, baby, I'm talkin' about your real good thing's
About to come to an end

Getting myself back together
Is gonna be a big problem, I know
But when the right girl says, that she wants me
You can bet, I won't say no, no, no

Look out baby, your good thing's
Your good thing's about to come to an end, baby
I'm talkin' about your real good thing's
About to come to an end, baby

Don't let no one turn you away from me though
Your good thing might to come to an end, baby
You better hold, hold on to what you got girl
You know you got all of my love, baby
