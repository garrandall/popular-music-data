I don't have to beg you to hold me
Cause somebody else will
You don't have to love me when I want it, no
Cause somebody else will

Your so called friends say you don't need it
When all the time they're trying to get it
I said 

You better look out
Your good thing
Is about to come to an end
I'm talking about your real good thing
About to come to an end

All those nights I watched the four walls
I didn't have to watch them all alone
And whenever someone said they wanted me
I didn't have to tell them I was your very own

You have all the love that I've got baby
But even ice melts to water and gets hot

You better look out
Your good thing
Is about to come to an end
I'm talking about your real good thing
About to come to an end

Gettin' myself back together
Is gonna be a big problem I know
But when the right girl says he wants me
You can bet I won't say no, no, no, no

But honey, you better look out
Your good thing
Is about to come to an end
I'm talking about your real good thing
About to come to an end
I'm talking about your real good, real good thing
About to come to an end
You better look out...
