Dear lover
It's been a long long time

So I'm writing this letter to find out if your still mine

Oh I miss you so much

And I wish I can see you some how

Let no others take your heart while your apart from me

Please be faithfull please be true

I'LL NEVER STOP LOVING YOU

Dear lover
I wonder do you fell the same way too

Does this felling in your heart as strong
As the love I have for you

Ohh you must belive me when I say
I never love this way

Ohh I'll be yours till the end of time
IF THERE FOREVER AND A DAY
IF THRERS FOREVER AND A DAY

Ohh dear lover
If you would just answer my letter

A few words from you
Could make me feel so much better

Yeahhh

(Dear lover)oh I need ya
(Dear lover) aim to please ya
(Dear lover)if you would just answer my letter
(Dear lover)it would make me fell so much better
(Dear lover) ohlove ya
(Dear lover)
