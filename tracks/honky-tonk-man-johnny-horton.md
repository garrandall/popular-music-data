I'm a honky tonk man, and I cain't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl to the music of an old jukebox
But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone
Callin' hey moma can you're daddy come home?

I'm livin' fast and dangerously, but I've got plenty of company
When the moon comes up and the sun goes down
That's when I wanna see the lights of town

It takes a purdy little gal and a jug of wine
That's what it takes to make a honky tonk mind
With the jukebox a moanin' a honky tonk sound
That's when I wanna lay my money down
