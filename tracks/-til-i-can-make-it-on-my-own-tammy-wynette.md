I'll need time to get You off my mind
And I may sometimes bother You
Try to be in touch with You
Even ask too much of You, from time to time

Now and then
Lord, You know I'll need a friend
And 'till I get used to losing You
Let me keep on using You
'Til I can make it on my own

I'll get by, but no matter how I try
There'll be times that You'll know I'll call
Chances are my tears will fall
And I'll have no pride at all, from time to time

But they say, oh, there'll be a brighter day
But 'til then I lean on You
That's all I mean to do
'Til I can make it on my own

Surely someday I'll look up and see the morning sun
Without another lonely night behind me
Then I'll know I'm over You and all my cryin's done
No more hurtin' memories can find me

But 'til then
Lord, You know I'm gonna need a friend
'Til I get used to losing You
Let me keep on using You
'Til I can make it on my own
'Til I can make it on my own
