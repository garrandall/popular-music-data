True love had found us and vowed to be around us
till the end of the time (baby baby)
And we were the lovers who once could show the others
how a poem should rhyme (oh didn't we baby)
That love has faded from your touch somehow,
it seems one-sided to me now, I beg you.

Babe let's bring back that once in a lifetime
when we were the ones who took a ride on a rainbow
and kissed in the sun.
Let's try to bring back the time when we had stars in our eyes.
Hey babe, this once in a lifetime, let's fly.
Don't say goodbye,
don't let our love just die.

And though I'm so near you I'm living in the fear 
you will leave soon (baby baby)
And we sang the chorus that love had written for us.
but we fell out of tune (oh didn't we baby)
No doubt this broken heart will never mend.
You know I'll love you to the end, I beg you.

Babe let's bring back that once in a lifetime
when we were the ones who took a ride on a rainbow
and kissed in the sun.
Let's try to bring back the time when we had stars in our eyes.
Hey babe, this once in a lifetime, let's fly.
Don't say goodbye,
don't let our love just die.
Bring back the love of yesterday
that somehow got away
'cause baby I love you,
you know that I love you.
