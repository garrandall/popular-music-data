I kept waiting on a reason
And a call that never came
No, I never saw it coming
Something in you must have changed


All the words unspoken, promises broken
I cried for so long
Wasted too much time, should've seen the signs
Now I know just what went wrong


I guess I wanted you more
And looking back now, I'm sure
I wanted you more
I guess I wanted you more


All the nights we spent, just talking
Of the things we wanted out of life
Making plans and dreams together
I wish I'd seen, I was just too blind


My heart was open, exposed and hoping
For you to lay it on the line
But in the end it seemed
There was no room for me
Still, I tried to change your mind


I guess I wanted you more
And looking back now, I'm sure
I wanted you more
I guess I wanted you more

Oh, I don't need you
I don't need you anymore

I guess I wanted you more
And looking back now, I'm sure
I wanted you more
I guess I wanted you more

I don't need you
I don't need you anymore
