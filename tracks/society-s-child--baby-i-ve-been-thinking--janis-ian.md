Come to my door, baby
Face is clean and shining black as night
My mother went to answer you know
That you looked so fine
Now I could understand your tears and your shame
She called you "boy" instead of your name
When she wouldn't let you inside
When she turned and said
"But honey, he's not our kind."


She says I can't see you any more, baby
Can't see you anymore


Walk me down to school, baby
Everybody's acting deaf and blind
Until they turn and say, "Why don't you stick to your own kind."
My teachers all laugh, their smirking stares
Cutting deep down in our affairs
Preachers of equality
Think they believe it, then why won't they just let us be?


They say I can't see you anymore baby
Can't see you anymore


One of these days I'm gonna stop my listening
Gonna raise my head up high
One of these days I'm gonna raise my glistening wings and fly
But that day will have to wait for a while
Baby I'm only society's child
When we're older things may change
But for now this is the way, they must remain


I say I can't see you anymore baby
Can't see you anymore
No, I won't see you anymore, baby
