Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can’t you see my love shine through dark?
Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can’t you see my love shine through dark?

Can’t you see that you must be apart
Of the beat in my heart
That beat in my heart

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah
My baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah

After all
That we’ve been through
I can’t seem to face the fact that boy, I’m losing you
L threw away all ties
With those venetian blinds
I looked
And saw my heart just overrule my mind

And I’ve tried not to let it show
Now I don’t know what to do
Told myself I’m lying
So let’s not just let it go
My heart does double beats for you
Ooh

Now you know my love won’t come close
All this love will turn to gold
If we stay in love
All my love
My love
My love

Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can’t you see my love shine through dark?
Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can’t you see my love shine through dark?

Can’t you see that you must be apart
Of the beat in my heart
That beat in my heart
That beat

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah
My baby
(Baby)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah

It’s like trying to touch the sky
But overlook the sun
That's why reality keeps telling me
That you’re the one

Just the very thought of you
Gets me aroused
I can feel my heartbeat cry through my blouse

And darling, I’ve tried not to show
Now I don’t know what to do
Told myself I’m dying
So let’s not just let it go
My heart does double beats for you, baby

And I hope you feel the same
Cause I do know for sure, baby
That sure as my name
Oh, baby
I know that you’re the cure

Now you know my love won’t come close
All this love will turn to gold
If we stay in love
All my love
My love
My love

Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can’t you see my love shine through dark?
Can you feel the beat within my heart
Can’t you see my love shine through dark?

Can’t you see that
You must be apart of the beat in my heart?
That beat in my heart
That beat

Th-th-that-that beat
Th-th-that-that beat
Th-th-that-that beat
Th-th-that-that beat
Th-th-that-that beat
Th-th-that-that beat

Can you feel the beat?
Can-can-can you feel?
Can you feel?
Can-can-can you feel?
Can you feel?

Can-can-can you feel
Can you feel?
Can you feel that beat?
That beat

Can you feel the beat?
Can you feel the beat?
Well, can you feel the beat?
Can you feel the beat?
Talk to me

Now you know my love won’t come close
All this love will turn to gold
If we stay in love
All my love
My love, my love

With every beat of my heart
Every beat of my heart, yeah
All my love
With every beat of my heart
Every beat of my heart
And all my love

My love
My love
My love
My love
My love

Don’t stop
One more time

You know my love won’t come close
All this love will turn to gold
If we stay in love
All my love

My love
My love
My love
My love
My love

My love
My love
My love
My love
My love
