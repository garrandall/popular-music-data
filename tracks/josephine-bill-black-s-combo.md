There never was a gal I could love, like I love my Josephine
She's a flirt, she's a scamp, she's the vampiest vamp I've ever seen
It seems to me she's always flirting with the fellows passing by
But when I say she winks, then she tells me she thinks
There's a cinder in her eye
I believe it would be better if I'd leave her and forget
Everybody says it would be wise
But each time that I go out to dance with somebody else
I find myself dancing with tears in my eyes
For there's nobody quite so nice who can be quite so mean
As my gal, what a gal, Josephine
There never was a gal I could love, like I love my Josephine
She's a flirt, she's a scamp, she's the vampiest vamp I've ever seen
It seems to me she's always flirting with the fellows passing by
But when I say she winks, then she tells me she thinks
There's a cinder in her eye
I believe it would be better if I'd leave her and forget
Everybody says it would be wise
But each time that I go out to dance with somebody else
I find myself dancing with tears in my eyes
For there's nobody quite so nice who can be quite so mean
As my gal, what a gal, Josephine
