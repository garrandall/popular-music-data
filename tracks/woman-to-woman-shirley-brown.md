Hello, may I speak to Barbara
Barbara, this is Shirley
You might not know who I am
But the reason I am calling you is because
I was going through my
Old man's pockets this morning
And I just happened to find your name and number

So woman to woman
I don't think it's being anymore than fair
To call you and let you know
Where I'm coming from

Now Barbara
I don't know how you're gonna take this
But whether you be cool
Or come out of a bag on me
You see it doesn't really make any difference

But it's only fair that I let you know that
The man you're in love with
He's mine

From the top of his head
To the bottom of his feet
The bed he sleeps in
And every piece of food he eats

You see, I make it possible
The clothes on his back
Ha ha, I buy them
The car he drives
I pay the note every month

So I'm telling you these things
To let you know how much I love that man
And woman to woman
I think you'll understand
How much I'll do to keep him

Woman to woman
If you've ever been in love
Then you know how I feel
And woman to woman
Now, if you were in my shoes
Wouldn't you have done the same thing too

Oh, oh, woman to woman
Can't you see where I'm coming from
Woman to woman
Ain't that the same thing you would've done

Woman to woman
Now should I just step aside
And let her take what's rightfully mine

Oh, oh, woman to woman
Was I right or was I wrong
I ain't gonna let you break up my happy home

Now woman to woman
Now you see I don't want no trouble now
I hope you understand
I love that man and he's mine

I'm talking to you
Woman to woman
You should be woman enough to understand
That man, I love that man

Woman, woman
Woman to woman, he's mine
And I ain't gonna give him up
My baby, I ain't lying, now
