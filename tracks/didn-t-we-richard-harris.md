Here I am, a tramp shining
A brand new clown

This time we almost made the pieces fit
Didn't we, girl?
This time we almost made some sense of it
Didn't we girl?

This time I had the answer
Right here in my hand
Then I touched it and
It had turned to sand

This time we almost sang our song in tune
Didn't we, girl?
This time we almost made it to the moon
Oh, didn't we, girl?

This time we almost made
Our poem rhyme
This time we almost made
That long, hard climb
Didn't we almost make it
This time?
