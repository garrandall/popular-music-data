Oo-oo-oo Oo oo Oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo Oo
I'm on fire with somebody
Well I just can't believe it's you again
All those lies and they're hurting
It's taking time for all those scars to mend
Girl, since you left me
It's been a long time... a long time
We'll lay it on the line

If you'll just touch me tonight
And give me one more chance to make it right
Baby touch me tonight
If you feel the love in your heart
Then touch me tonight

Oo-oo-oo Oo oo Oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo Oo

Let it out don't take it
With all those words are just in the past
Give it time we can make it
'Cause only truth can ever make it last

No, don't be afraid
You've got to hold on... hold on
We know the feeling is strong
So won't you touch me tonight?
Just give me one more chance to make it right
And baby touch me tonight
If you feel the love in your heart
Then touch me tonight

When it burns itself into that southern sky
There's a voice whispering in my ear
Tonight's gonna be the night

On the street no one's turning
And I've been fighting a losing fight
In the heat something's burning
I need somebody who can make it right
You... you got it all
And if you want to see it through
I won't go far from you

If you'll just touch me tonight
Well it ain't easy
Touch me tonight
Baby... Oh, you've got to touch me tonight

Touch me tonight and it'll be all right
Touch me tonight
If you feel the love in your heart
Then touch me tonight
Oo-oo-oo Oo oo Oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo Oo
Oo-oo-oo Oo oo Oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo Oo
