I have found that one and only love
One my heart has been searching for
Other loves have said a lot, I know
But so unlike the ones I knew before

Baby, you says it all
Baby, you says it all
Baby, you says it all
You says it all, all

I have felt that one and only dream
One I know this heart will always feel

You have made my
Life one endless smile
I got to say I really
I really like your style

Baby, you (baby, you says it all)
Good God almighty, I said you, you
(Baby, you says it all)
My baby says it all
(Baby, you says it all)
You says it all, all

And you have made
My life one endless smile
I got to say I really
I really like your style

Baby, you (you say, you say)
(You says it all)
God almighty, baby, you
(You say, you say)
(You says it all)

My, baby, you
(Baby, you says it all)
Wow, wow, wow
(You say, you say)
(You says it all)

My baby says it all
(You say, you say)
(You says it all)
From her head to her toes
(You say, you say)
(You says it all)

I want everybody to know
(You say, you say)
(You says it all)
Hey, hey, you, you, you
(You say, you say)
(You says it all)...
