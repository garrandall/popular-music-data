(T Romeo)
Poor Baby, something always bringing you down
If you look for it baby, there's so much unhappiness all around
Don't cry, your daddy gonna buy your one-way ticket to sunshine
Cheer up your ... try to clear up your mind
Poor Baby, try to feel better
Nothing's as bad as it may seem
Poor Baby, under the weather
Try to close your eyes and dream
Think of the good times (good times)
Just think of the good times that we're gonna see
Poor Baby, try to feel better
Nothing's as bad as it may seem
Poor Baby, under the weather
Try to close your eyes and dream
Think of the good times (good times)
Just think of the good times that we're gonna see
Don't fret, your daddy gonna fetch your one-way ticket to happy
Cheer up your ... try to clear up your mind
Poor Baby, try to feel better
Nothing's as bad as it may seem
Poor Baby, under the weather
Try to close your eyes and dream
Think of the good times (good times)
Just think of the good times that we're gonna see
Poor Baby, try to feel better
Nothing's as bad as it may seem
Poor Baby, under the weather
Try to close your eyes and dream
Think of the good times (good times)
Just think of the good times that we're gonna see
