Here in the morning light I stand
With a suitcase and a guitar in my hand
One way Sunday
Sitting in the airport bar
And trying to look like a superstar
Waiting for the plane to take me far away
Still she finds a reason to stay (still she finds a way)
Still she finds a reason to see
What I have today
Denver, Oklahoma, San Anton
Another gig a long long way from home
One way Sunday
Where do we play tonight?
I hope that this show will be all right
Maybe I'll phone you tonight
Still she finds a reason to stay (still she finds a way)
Still she finds a reason to see
What I have today
Maybe when my travelling days are through
I'll come on back and stay at home with you
All my Sundays
Sleeping in the early sun
Playing my guitar to no one
Making up to you all the things I've never done
Will you find a reason to stay (Will you find a way)
Will you find a reason to see
What I have today
