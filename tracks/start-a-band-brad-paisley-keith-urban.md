I never was a straight-lace, straight A student
teacher's pet or child prodigy
I wasn't gonna get rich throwin' a football
It take too long to get a law degree

So I sat down with momma and daddy
tried to talk some sense into my big head
But the best advice that I ever got
was from my sister's rock star boyfriend

Just get you a guitar and learn how to play
Cut up some jeans, come up with a name
When you're living in a world that you don't understand
Find a few good buddies, start a band
Start a band, Start a band

And all those girls that were too cool to talk to,
They'll be waiting in the line out back
Might get your picture in the hometown paper
Maybe buy your momma that Cadillac

Just get you a guitar and learn how to play
Cut up some jeans, come up with a name
When you're living in a world that you don't understand
Find a few good buddies, start a band

Start a band, Scrape up some money, buy a van
Learn free bird and ramblin' man
Never buy another beer again

Just get you a guitar and learn how to play
Grow out your hair, come up with a name
With a little bit of luck you'll be packing the stands
Find a few good buddies, start a band

No need to study, start a band
Call up some buddies man, start a band
