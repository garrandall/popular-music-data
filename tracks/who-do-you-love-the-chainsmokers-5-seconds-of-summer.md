Yeah
Found cigarettes in your Fendi coat
Even though you don't even smoke
Always changing your access codes
Yeah, I can tell you no one knew
Yeah you've been acting so conspicuous
You flip it on me, say I think too much
You're moving different when we're making love
Baby, tell me, tell me

Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know the truth (Woah)
Who do you love, do you love now?
I know it's someone new
You ain't gotta make it easy
Where you been sleeping?
This shit is keeping me up at night
Just admit it
Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know, I wanna know who

Now, now, who do you, who do you love, love (Yeah)
Now, now, who do you, who do you love now (Woah)
Now, now, who do you, who do you love, love (Yeah)
I wanna know, I wanna know who

Well, keep switching your alibi
Or stuttering when you reply
You can't ever look me in the eye
I can tell, I know you're lyin'
'Cause you've been acting so conspicuous (Conspicuous)
You flip it on me say I think too much (Too much)
We're movin' different when we're making love
So baby tell me, tell me

Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know the truth (Woah)
Who do you love, do you love now?
I know it's someone new
You ain't gotta make it easy
Where you been sleeping?
This shit is keeping me up at night
Just admit it
Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know, I wanna know who

Now, now, who do you, who do you love, love (Yeah)
Now, now, who do you, who do you love now (Woah)
Now, now, who do you, who do you love, love (Yeah)
I wanna know, I wanna know who

(Who?) You've been acting so conspicuous
(Who?) You flip it on me say I think too much
(Who?) Moving different when we're making love
(Who?) Baby tell me, tell me

Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know the truth (Woah)
Who do you love, do you love now?
I know it's someone new
You ain't gotta make it easy
Where you been sleeping?
This shit is keeping me up at night
Just admit it
Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know, I wanna know who

Now, now, who do you, who do you love, love
Now, now, who do you, who do you love now
Now, now, who do you, who do you love, love
Now, now, who do you, who do you love now

You ain't gotta make it easy
Where you been sleeping?
This shit is keeping me up at night
Just admit it
Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know, I wanna know who

(Who do you, who do you love, love)
(Now, now, who do you, who do you love now)
(Now, now, who do you, who do you love, love)
