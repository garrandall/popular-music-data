Baby, if we cant solve any problems
Why do we lose so many tears? 
Oh, so you go again
When the leading man appears
Always the same theme
But cant you see weve got everything going on and on and on

Everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you
Everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you

( Everytime You Go..)

Go on and go free
Maybe youre too close to me
I can feel your body move
But does it mean that much to me
I cant go on singing the same theme
Cant see we've got everything
Baby, even though you know

Everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you
Everytime you go away 
You take a piece of me with you
Ohhhhhhh oooohhhh,
Everytime you go away

I cant go on singing the same theme
Baby, can't you see eve got everything going on

Everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you 
Everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you
Ohhh,
Everytime you go away
Yeah,
You take a piece of me with you
Oooooh,
Everytime you go away
Yeah,
You take a piece of me with you
Ohhhhhhh oooohhhh,

( Everytime You Go..)
Everytime You Go
