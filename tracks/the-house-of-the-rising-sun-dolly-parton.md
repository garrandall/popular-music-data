There is a house in New Orleans
Down in the Vieux Carr'e
A house they call the rising sun
Where love and money are made

My father he was a gambler
Mother died when I was young
And I've worked since then
To pleasure the men
At the house of the rising sun

There is a house
In New Orleans
They call the rising sun
It's been the ruin of many a good girl
And oh God, you know I'm one

So mothers you go telling all your daughters
Not to do what I have done
To live a life of sin, shame and strife
In the house of the rising sun

There is a house down in New Orleans
They call the rising sun
It's been the ruin of many a good girl
And oh God, you know I'm one
Oh God, you know I'm one
