Seven weeks have passed now since she left me
She shows her face to ask me how I am
She says the kids are fine and that they miss me
Maybe I could come and baby sit sometime

She says, "Are you ok
I was worried about you
Can you forgive me?
I hope that you'll be happy"

I'm so happy that I can't stop crying
I'm so happy I'm laughing through my tears

I saw a friend of mine
He said, "I was worried about you
I heard she had another man
I wondered how you felt about it?"

I'm so happy that I can't stop crying
I'm so happy I'm laughing though my tears

Saw my lawyer
Mr Good News
He got me joint custody
And legal separation

I'm so happy that I can't stop crying
I'm laughing through my tears, I'm laughing through my tears

I took a walk alone last night, I looked up at the stars
To try and find an answer in my life
I chose a star for me, I chose a star for him
I chose two stars for my kids and one star for my wife

Something made me smile
Something seemed to ease the pain
Something about the Universe
And how it's all connected

The park is full of Sunday fathers and melted ice cream
We try to do the best within the given time
A kid should be with his mother, everybody knows that
What can a father do but baby sit sometimes?

I saw that friend of mine he said
"You look different somehow"
I said, "Everybody's got to
Leave the darkness sometime"

I'm so happy that I can't stop crying
I'm laughing through my tears, I'm laughing through my tears

I'm so happy that I can't stop crying
I'm laughing through my tears, I'm laughing through my tears
