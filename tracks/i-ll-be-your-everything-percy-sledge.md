Paroles de la chanson I'll Be Your Everything :
You can call me when you want me, if you need a friend you got me
I'll be your everything, fulfill your every dream
We can do it automatic, I'll just call out go go gadget
I'll be your everything
You'll see I'm everything you want and more

I knew the moment that we met
I had to be a part of you, someone you won't forget
So don't say I'm like the other few
No matter what is going down, you'll find me next to you

Girl, I'll be your superman, I'll do what no one can
You'll find that I'm the everything that you need
Deep down inside of you
No matter what you do
You'll see I'm everything you want and more

You can call me when you want me, if you need a friend you got me
I'll be your everything, fulfill your every dream
We can do it automatic, I just call out go go gadget
I'll be your everything
You'll see I'm everything you want and more

No sweat, when the claw is on his way
Don't worry 'bout him catching you, don't even be afraid
Some how some way, I'll find out what's the deal
And I'll be there to rescue you, you'll see that I'm for real

Girl, I'll be your superman, I'll do what no one can
You'll find that I'm the everything that you need
Deep down inside of you
No matter what you do
You'll see I'm everything you want and more

You can call me when you want me
If you need a friend you got me I'll be your everything, fulfill your every dream
We can do it automatic, I just call out go go gadget
I'll be your everything
You'll see I'm everything you want and more

You can call me when you want me
If you need a friend you got me I'll be your everything, fulfill your every dream
We can do it automatic, I just call out go go gadget
I'll be your everything
You'll see I'm everything you want and more

You can call me when you want me
If you need a friend you got me I'll be your everything, fulfill your every dream
We can do it automatic, I just call out go go gadget
I'll be your everything
You'll see I'm everything you want and more
