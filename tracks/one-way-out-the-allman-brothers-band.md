Ain't but one way out, baby, Lord I just can't go out the door
Ain't but one way out, baby and Lord, I just can't go out the door
'Cause there's a man down there - might be your man, I don't know


Lord, you got me trapped, woman, up on the second floor
If I get by this time I won't be trapped no more
So raise your window, baby and I can ease out soft and slow
And Lord, your neighbors, no they won't be
Talking that stuff that they don't know




Lord, I'm foolish to be here on the first place
I know some man gonna walk in and take my place, and
Ain't no way in the world I'm going out that front door
'Cause there's a man down there - might be your man, I don't know


'Cause there's a man down there - might be your man, I don't know
'Cause there's a man down there
Lord, it just might happen to be your man
Oh, it just-a might be your man
Mmm-mm-mmm-mm
Lord, it just-a might be your man
Oh baby, I just don't know
