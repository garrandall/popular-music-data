Do ya wanna get rocked?

Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get
Rocked...

I'm your average, ordinary, everyday kid,
Happy to do nothin'
In fact that's what I did.
Got a million ways to make my day, but daddy don't agree
'Cos when I try to get away he says
He get plans for me

Get your butt right out of bed - Stop buggin' me
Get up and move your sleepy head - Don't shake my tree.

He said
Mow the lawn - Who, me?
Walk the dog - Not my style, man!
Take out the trash - No way!
Tidy your room - C'mon get real!
Sorry dad, gotta disappear,
Let's get the rock outta here.

Seven-day weekend,
Up all night,
In at the deep end,
Hang on tight
Won't take a minute,
Won't take long,
So get on in it,
Come on, come on, come on

Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's go all the way, get it night'n'day
C'mon let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked.

I'm your average, ordinary, everyday dude
Drivin' with my baby, To get her in the mood
She's dialin'through my radio and I'm ready to make my move,
But what she got ain't rock'n'roll and it really blew my groove

It was - Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven
It makes me wanna scream - Bach, Tchaikovsky, violins
Turn it off! - That ain't my scene
Well I'm sorry girl, here's my confession
I suppose a rock's out of the question?




Oh, all I wanna do is take a ride into the blue
Every time I want to love you I get stuck inside my room
Heaven knows I'm sick'n'tired of dancin' with this broom
I feel lucky today
Hey, look at that man!
Do ya wanna get rocked?
Do ya wanna get rocked?

It won't take you a minute,
It won't take that long,
So get on, get with it,
Oh, c'mon
Everybody!

Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Get on top, baby
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Do ya wanna?
Do ya wanna?
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Get on top of it
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Love to rock your body, baby
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's go all the way,
Let's do it night and day,
Let's get out and play,
Rock the night away
C'mon
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get (rocked)
Oh,
Do ya wanna get rocked?
