(Oh)
Turn up the music
Let's get out on the floor
I like to move it
Come and give me some more

Watch me getting physical
Out of control, ah
There's people watching me, ah
I never miss a beat

Still the night, kill the lights
Feel it under your skin
Time is right, keep it tight
'Cause it's pulling you in

Wrap it up you can't stop
'Cause it feels like an overdose
(Feels like an overdose)

Oh, oh
Evacuate the dancefloor
Oh, oh
I'm infected by the sound
Oh, oh
Stop this beat is killing me
Hey Mr. DJ let the music take me underground

(Everybody in the club)
Oh, oh
Evacuate the dancefloor
Oh, oh
I'm infected by the sound
(Everybody in the club)
Oh, oh
Stop this beat is killing me
Hey Mr. DJ come burn this place right down to the ground

(Oh)
My body's aching
System overload
Temperature's rising
I'm about to explode

Watch me I'm intoxicated
Taking the show, ah
It's got me hypnotized, ah
Everybody step aside

Still the night, kill the lights
Feel it under your skin
Time is right, keep it tight
'Cause it's pulling you in

Wrap it up you can't stop
'Cause it feels like an overdose
(Feels like an overdose)

Oh, oh
Evacuate the dancefloor
Oh, oh
I'm infected by the sound
Oh, oh
Stop this beat is killing me
Hey Mr. DJ let the music take me underground

(Everybody in the club)
Oh, oh
Evacuate the dancefloor
Oh, oh
I'm infected by the sound
(Everybody in the club)
Oh, oh
Stop this beat is killing me
Hey Mr. DJ come burn this place right down to the ground

Come on and evacuate
Feel the club is heating up
Move on and accelerate
Push it to the top
Come on and evacuate
Feel the club is heating up
Move on and accelerate
You don't have to be afraid

Now guess who's back with a brand new track?
They got everybody in the club going mad
So everybody in the back
Get your back up off the wall and just shake that thang

Go crazy
Yo lady
Yo baby
Let me see you wreck that thang
Now drop it down low, low
Let me see you take it to the dancefloor, yo

Everybody in the club
(Evacuate the dancefloor)
Everybody in the club
(I'm infected by the sound)

Everybody in the club
(Stop this beat is killing me)
Hey Mr. DJ let the music take me underground

Oh, oh
Evacuate the dancefloor
Oh, oh
I'm infected by the sound
Oh, oh
Stop this beat is killing me
Hey Mr. DJ let the music take me underground

(Everybody in the club)
Oh, oh
Evacuate the dancefloor
Oh, oh
I'm infected by the sound
(Everybody in the club)
Oh, oh
Stop this beat is killing me
Hey Mr. DJ come burn this place right down to the ground
