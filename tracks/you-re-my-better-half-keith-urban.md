Car door slams, it's been a long day at work
I'm out on the freeway and I'm wondering if it's all worth
The price that I pay, sometimes it doesn't seem fair
I pull into the drive and you're standing there
And you look at me
And give me that come-here-baby smile
It's all going to be alright
You take my hand
You pull me close and you hold me tight


And it's the sweet love that you give to me
That makes me believe we can make it through anything
Because when it all comes down
And I'm feeling like I'll never last
I just lean on you because baby
You're my better half


They say behind every man is a good woman
But I think that's a lie
Because when it comes to you I'd rather have you by my side
You don't know how much I count on you to help me win
When I've given everything I got and I just feel like giving in
And you look at me
And give me that come-here-baby smile
It's all going to be alright
You take my hand
Yeah you pull me close and you hold me tight


And it's the sweet love that you give to me
That makes me believe we can make it through anything
Because when it all comes down
And I'm feeling like I'll never last
I just lean on you because baby
You're my better half
Uuuuh I need your love

Well, you take my hand
Yeah you pull me close and I understand
It's the sweet love that you give to me
That makes me believe that we can make it through anything


Baby it's the sweet love that you give to me
That makes me believe we can make it through anything
Because when it all comes down
And I'm feeling like I'll never last
I just lean on you because baby
You're my better half

Oh oh baby you're my better half
Oooh, hey baby you're my better half
