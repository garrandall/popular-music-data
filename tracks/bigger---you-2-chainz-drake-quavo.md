Yeah, VIP my squad (yeah)
Drop off all the gang (yeah)
VIP, the lane (skrrt)
VIP, the chain (squad)
(Murda on the beat so it's not nice)
VIP, my squad (yeah, squad)
Drop off all the gang (yeah)
VIP, the lane (skrrt, yeah)
VIP, the chain

Uh, yeah, baller alert
Lil biddy bitch on caller alert (brrrrp)
Uh, yeah, follow alert
Go get the fire when I'm callin' 'em merked
Uh, yeah, have to come first
I whip the baby, the baby gon' birth (whip it)
Uh, yeah, I bought a Claren (woo)
I bought a 'Claren, didn't wanna buy percs, uh
This shit bigger than you (hey)
I'm taking on a new path (uh)
Making the bitch take a bath (woo)
Lil biddy bitch, do the math (yeah)
Lil nigga, who are you? (who you, yeah)
Must be bulletproof (brrrp)
This shit bigger than you (it big)
This shit bigger than you


Chain so big, should have came with a kick stand
Fuck with me, I got a retain on a hit man (bop)
Barely came up out the mud like quicksand (barely)
I show you how to get millions, nigga, that's a mil plan, now
Uh, yeah, ring the alarm
Cartier bracelets on all of my arms
Uh, yeah, halo my son
In the wheelchair, and I still perform
(Uh) I don't make excuses, you know that I'm hungry, I still got the juice
Uh, you settle down like a Cleo, I settle down like a boost


Uh, yeah, baller alert
Lil biddy bitch on caller alert (brrrrp)
Uh, yeah, follow alert
Go get the fire when I'm callin' 'em merked
Uh, yeah, have to come first
I whip the baby, the baby gon' birth (whip it)
Uh, yeah, I bought a Claren (woo)
I bought a 'Claren, didn't wanna buy percs, uh
This shit bigger than you (hey)
I'm taking on a new path (uh)
Making the bitch take a bath (woo)
Lil biddy bitch, do the math (yeah)
Lil nigga, who are you? (who you?)
Must be bulletproof (brrrp) (bye)
This shit bigger than you (it big)
This shit bigger than you


Young champagne checkin' in, man, Tity Boi shit ringin' off
'Member I was on pre-paid, I would act like my shit was ringin' off
'Member shorty told me she thought the raps good but the singing's off
Watch on Young Dro now, man, boioing shit blingin' off
Where the racks at? (racks)
All I know is they keep comin' to me like a flashback, nigga, what? (what?)
Half a million out in Vegas, it ain't no blackjack, nigga, naw (naw)
Quavo Sinatra, but we could never be the ratpack, nigga, naw


Uh, yeah, baller alert
Lil biddy bitch on caller alert (brrrrp)
Uh, yeah, follow alert

Uh, yeah, I bought a Claren (woo)
I bought a 'Claren, didn't wanna buy percs, uh

Making the bitch take a bath (woo, tell 'em)
Lil biddy bitch, do the math (yeah)
Lil nigga, who are you? (Who you?)
Must be bulletproof (brrrp) (bye)
This shit bigger than you (it big)
This shit bigger than you


Touchscreen on my cars, vintage one to two
I just bought a watch that's plain like a Dickie suit (plain)
I sip some red wine, and chased it with the '42
They asked me what I call millions, comin' soon
Yeah, I just cashed out (yeah)
(Uh) Ain't got time for a beef from a cash cow (tell 'em)
When I was in juvie, I made 'em back out (back that ass up)
It was 400 degrees, you would have passed out


Uh, yeah, baller alert
Lil biddy bitch on caller alert (brrrrp)
Uh, yeah, follow alert
Go get the fire when I'm callin' 'em merked (yeaaaah)
Uh, yeah, have to come first
I whip the baby, the baby gon' birth (whip it)
Uh, yeah, I bought a Claren (woo)
I bought a 'Claren, didn't wanna buy percs, uh
This shit bigger than you (hey)
I'm taking on a new path (uh)
Making the bitch take a bath (woo)
Lil biddy bitch, do the math (yeah)
Lil nigga, who are you? (who you?)
Must be bulletproof (brrrp) (bye)
This shit bigger than you (it big)
This shit bigger than you

VIP my squad (yeah)
Drop off all the gang (yeah)
