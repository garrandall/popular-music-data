Somebody said every day was gon' be sunny skies,
Only Marvin Gaye and lingerie, I guess somebody lied
We started discussin' it to fightin' then "Don't touch me, please"
Then it's "Let's stop the madness, just come lay with me"
And truth be told I'm wavin' my flag before it goes bad

'Cause we made it this far for better or worse
I wanna feel it even if it hurts
If I gotta cry
To get to the other side,
Let's go 'cause we're gon' survive

We stay on the front lines
Yeah but we're still here after the bomb drops
We go so hard we lose control
The fire starts then we explode
When the smoke clears we dry our tears
Only at love and war

Sometimes you're my general,
You quarterback all these plays
Sometimes you're my enemy
And I'm throwin' grenades

We'll just be chillin' and laughin',
I'm layin' on your chest
Don't know what happened
'Cause things just went left

But here we go back down that road
That's just the way that it goes

'Cause we made it this far on for better or worse
I wanna feel it even if it hurts
If I gotta cry
To get to the other side,
As long as you're there I'll survive

We stay on the front lines
Yeah but we're still here after the bomb drops
We go so hard we lose control
The fire starts then we explode
When the smoke clears we dry our tears
Only at love and war

As long as we make up after every fight when it's over
You know I'm comin' home
Right there where I belong
I'm takin' off this armor

And we stay on the front lines
Yeah but we're still here after the bomb drops
We go so hard we lose control
The fire starts then we explode baby
When the smoke clears we dry our tears
Only at love and war
Only at love and war
Only at love and war
