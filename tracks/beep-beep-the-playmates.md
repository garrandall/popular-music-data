While riding in my Cadillac
What to my surprise
A little Nash Rambler was following me -
About one third my size
The guy must've wanted to pass me up
As he kept on tooting his horn. Beep! Beep!
I'll show him that a Cadillac
Is not a car to scorn
Beep beep. Beep! Beep! Beep beep. Beep! Beep!
His horn went beep beep beep. Beep! Beep!

I pushed my foot down to the floor
To give the guy the shake
But the little Nash Rambler stayed right behind;
He still had on his brake
He must have thought his car had more guts
As he kept on tooting his horn. Beep! Beep!
I'll show him that a Cadillac
Is not a car to scorn
Beep beep. Beep! Beep! Beep beep. Beep! Beep!
His horn went beep beep beep. Beep! Beep!

My car went into passing gear
And we took off with gust
Soon we were doing ninety -
Must've left him in the dust
When I peeked in the mirror of my car
I couldn't believe my eyes:
The little Nash Rambler was right behind -
I think that guy could fly
Beep beep. Beep! Beep! Beep beep. Beep! Beep!
His horn went beep beep beep

Now we're doing a hundred and ten -
This certainly was a race
For a Rambler to pass a Caddy
Would be a big disgrace
The guy must've wanted to pass me up
As he kept on tooting his horn
I'll show him that a Cadillac
Is not a car to scorn
Beep beep. Beep! Beep! Beep beep. Beep! Beep!
His horn went beep beep beep

Now we're doing a hundred and twenty -
As fast as I could go
The Rambler pulled along side of me
As if we were going slow
The fellow rolled down his window
And yelled for me to hear
"Hey, Buddy, how can I get this car
Out of second gear!"
Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep!
