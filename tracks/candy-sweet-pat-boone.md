Your lips are cherry pink
Your eyes are apple green
You are picture pretty
As a movie queen

Oh, my darling
You're such a treat
Mmm, best of all
Your love is candy sweet

Your heart is diamond precious
Pure and orchid red
Soft as baby tender
Warm as summer air

Oh, my darling
You can't be beat
Mmm, best of all
Your love is candy sweet

Every kiss you give me
Thrills me through and through
Well, I just want to hold and
Squeeze all your love from me

You're so lovey dovey
You're my hearts delight
I just want to love you
Every day and night

Oh, my darling
You're such a treat
Mmm, best of all
Your love is candy sweet

Mmm, best of all
Your love is candy sweet
Mmm, best of all
Your love is candy sweet
