I've been watching you for days, now baby
I just love your sexy ways, now baby
You know my love will never stop, now baby
Just put your loving in my box, now baby

Wrap it up, I'll take it
Wrap it up, I'll take it

Well, no more will I shop around, now baby
I know I got the best thing in town, now baby
I've seen all I want to see, now baby
Bring your loving straight to me, now baby

Wrap it up, I'll take it
Wrap it up, I'll take it
Wrap it up, I'll take it
Wrap it up, I'll take it

Well, I'm gonna treat you like the queen you are
Bring you sweet things from my candy jar
You've got tricks you ain't never used
Give it, give it to me, it won't be abused

I've been watching you for days, now baby
I just love your sexy ways, now baby
You know my love will never stop, now baby
Just put your loving in my box, now baby

Wrap it up, I'll take it
Wrap it up, I'll take it
Wrap it up, I'll take it
Wrap it up, I'll take it

Wrap, wrap
Wrap, wrap, wrap
Wrap it up, I'll take it...
