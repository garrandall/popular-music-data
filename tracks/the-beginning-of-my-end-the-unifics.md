Up drove the Hearse, Cadillac
A crowd of people gathered round all dressed in black
And as they removed her body from the car
Such pain I never knew, did fill my heart

I lost the only one I've ever loved
The Lord has returned her up above
Life will never be the same again
It was the beginning of my end


It happened on a Saturday night
My love and I had just had a silly fight
She got into her car and angrily drove away
Neither of us knew then that she'd never see another day

What have I done Lord to deserve this misery
All my life and all my world has come falling down on me


I was a home watching my TV
When the noise of the phone rudely disturbed me
I wasn't too sure at first, just what the doctor meant
When he informed me that there had been an accident

"Why, oh why?" I heard her mother cry
As I rushed to the scene with the tears in my eyes
Somebody asked, somebody asked who was the next of kin
And oh Lord, it was the beginning of my end
