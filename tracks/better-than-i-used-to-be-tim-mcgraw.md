I know how to hold a grudge
I can send a bridge up in smoke
And I can't count the people I've let down, the hearts I've broke
You ain't gotta dig too deep
If you wanna find some dirt on me
I'm learning who you've been
Ain't who you've got to be
It's gonna be an uphill climb
Aww honey I won't lie

I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
Iâm cleaning up my act little by little
Iâm getting there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see
I ainât as good as Iâm gonna get
But Iâm better than I used to be

Iâve pinned a lot of demons to the ground
Iâve got a few old habits left
But thereâs still one or two I might need you to help me get
Standing in the rain so long has left me with a little rust
But put some faith in me
And someday youâll see
Thereâs a diamond under all this dust

I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
Iâm cleaning up my act little by little
Iâm getting there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see
I ainât as good as Iâm gonna get
But Iâm better than I used to be

I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
But Iâm cleaning up my act little by little
Iâm getting there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see
I ainât as good as Iâm gonna get
But Iâm better than I used to be
