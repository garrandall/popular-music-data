I know you're not just a pretty face, you've got style, you've got grace
But I do need to know you a little more
I've seen your picture as a little girl, before the woman in you uncurled
But I do need to show you a little more
This love will last us forever, this love is gonna stay true
I know you've got what it's gonna take
And you've got a heart and it won't break
But I do need to show you a little more
And I've got this feelin', it's so much like pain
You've got me reelin', but I still can't explain
I wanna show you, baby, just a little more

This love will last us forever, this love is gonna stay true
This love will keep us together, this love, it's long overdue
Yeah!

This child, this girl, this woman that I dream about
She knows that I know, this love I couldn't live without

This love will last us forever, this love is gonna stay true
This love will keep us together, this love, it's long overdue
Yeah!
This love
