Take my hand, take a breath
Pull me close and take one step
Keep your eyes locked on mine
And let the music be your guide

Won't you promise me (now won't you promise me, that you'll never forget)
We'll keep dancing (to keep dancing)
Wherever we go next

It's like catching lightning, the chances of finding someone like you
It's one in a million, the chances of feeling the way we do
And with every step together, we just keep on getting better
So can I have this dance? (Can I have this dance?)
Can I have this dance?

Take my hand, I'll take the lead
And every turn will be safe with me
Don't be afraid, afraid to fall
You know I'll catch you through it all

And you can't keep us apart (even a thousand miles can't keep us apart)
Cause my heart is (cause my heart is) wherever you are

It's like catching lightning the chances of finding someone like you
It's one in a million, the chances of feeling the way we do
And with every step together, we just keep on getting better
So can I have this dance? (Can I have this dance?)
Can I have this dance?

Oh no mountains too high and no oceans too wide
Cause together or not, our dance won't stop
Let it rain, let it pour
What we have is worth fighting for
You know I believe, that we were meant to be

It's like catching lightning, the chances of finding
Someone like you (like you)
It's one in a million, the chances of feeling the way we do (way we do)
And with every step together, we just keep on getting better

So can I have this dance? (Can I have this dance?)
Can I have this dance?
And can I have this dance?
Can I have this dance?
