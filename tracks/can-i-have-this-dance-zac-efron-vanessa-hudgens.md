Take my hand, take a breath
Pull me close
And take one step
Keep your eyes locked on mine
And let the music be your guide

Won't you promise me (now won't you promise me)
That you'll never forget (we'll keep dancing)
To keep dancing
Wherever we go next

It's like catching lightning
The chances of finding someone like you
It's one in a million
The chances of feeling the way we do
And with every step together
We just keep on getting better

So can I have this dance? (can I have this dance?)
Can I have this dance?

Take my hand, I'll take the lead
And every turn
Will be safe with me
Don't be afraid
Afraid to fall
You know I'll catch you through it all

And you can't keep us apart (even a thousand miles can't keep us apart)
Cause my heart is where ever you are

It's like catching lightning
The chances of finding someone like you
It's one in a million
The chances of feeling the way we do
And with every step together
We just keep on getting better

So can I have this dance? (can I have this dance?)
Can I have this dance?

Oh
No mountain's too high
And no ocean's too wide
Cause together or not
Our dance won't stop

Let it rain, let it pour
What we have is worth fighting for
You know I believe
That we were meant to be
Yeah

It's like catching lightning
The chances of finding someone
Like you (like you)
It's one in a million
The chances of feeling the way
Way we do
And with every step together
We just keep on getting better

So can I have this dance? (can I have this dance?)
Can I have this dance?
Can I have this dance?
Can I have this dance?
