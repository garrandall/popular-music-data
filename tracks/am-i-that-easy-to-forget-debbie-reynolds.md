They say you've found somebody new
But that won't stop my loving you
I just can't let you walk away
Forget the love I had for you
Guess I could find somebody, too
But I don't want no one but you
How could you leave without regret?
Am I that easy to forget?
Before you leave be sure you find
You want her (his) love much more than mine
'Cause I'll just say we've never met
If I'm that easy to forget
Before you leave be sure you find
You want her (his) love much more than mine
'Cause I'll just say we've never met
If I'm that easy to forget
If I'm that easy to forget
