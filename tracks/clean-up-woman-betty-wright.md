Yeah, well alright
Oh, oh, oh yeah
Sisters better you'll sing your best
And we goin' take it back a little bit

The clean up woman is a woman who
Gets all the love we girls leave behind
The reason I know so much about her
Is because she picked up a man of mine

Chumpin' Slick was my ruin, I found out all I was doin'
Was makin' it easy, girl, for the clean up woman
To get my man's love, oh, yeah
Yeah, I made it easy for the clean up woman
To get my baby's love, uh huh

I took this man and I put him on the shelf
And like a fool I thought I had him all to myself
When he needed love, I was out havin' fun
And you know what he did?
He was not the guy, he was somebody else

Chumpin' Slick was my ruin, I found out all I was doin'
Was makin' it easy, yeah, for the clean up woman
To get my man's love, oh yeah
Yeah, I made it easy for the clean up woman
To get my baby's love, oh yeah

The clean up woman will wipe his blues away
(Wipe his blues away)
She'll give him plenty lovin' 24 hours a day
The clean up woman will sweep him off his feet
(Sweep him off his feet)
And she's the one that'll take him in when you dump him on the street

So take a tip, you better get hip
To the clean up woman 'cause she's tough
You know you better clean up

Oh, clean up, yeah, just clean it up
Yeah, I just clean it up, I just clean it up
Talk about clean it up
Oh, I'll talk it sweet with my broom
I found out, oh, 

Makin' it easy, yeah, for the clean up woman
To get my man's love, oh yeah
Yeah, I made it easy for the clean up woman
To get my baby's love, oh yeah
Yeah, I made it easy for the clean up woman
To get my man's love, oh
Yeah, I made it easy for the clean up woman

Just clean it up, just clean it up
Talk about clean it up, yeah
Clean it up, talk about
I'm not talkin' about clean it up
I'm just talkin' about clean it up
I'm not talkin' about clean it up
Not talkin' about clean it up

I'm not talkin' about clean it up
Not talkin' about clean it up
I'm not talkin' about clean it up
I'm not talkin' about clean it up
