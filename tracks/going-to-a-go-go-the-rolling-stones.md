(Robinson/Moore/Rogers/Tarplin)

Going to a go go, everybody
Going to a go go, c'mon now
Going to a go go, everybody
Going to a go go, c'mon now

Well there's a brand new place I found
People coming from miles around
They come from everywhere
If you drop in there
You see everyone in town

Going to a go go, everybody
Going to a go go, c'mon now
Don't you wanna go
And that's alright tell me

Going to a go go, everybody
Going to a go go

It doesn't matter if you're black
It doesn't matter if you're white
Take a dollar fifty
A six pack of beer
And we goin' dance all night

Going to a go go, everybody
Going to a go go, c'mon now
Don't you wanna go
And that's alright, tell me

Yeah, don't you wanna go, and that's alright, tell me

Going to a go go, everybody
Going to a go go

It doesn't matter you come in drag
It doesn't matter you come in stag
I'm telling everyone to get down here
Every taxi that you flag

Is going to a go go, everybody
Going to a go go
Don't you wanna go
And that's alright, tell me, yeah
That's alright, yeah
