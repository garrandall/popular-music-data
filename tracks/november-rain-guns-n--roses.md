When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But, darlin', when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same? Yeah...


'Cause nothing lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain


We've been through this such a long, long time
Just tryna kill the pain, oh yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head, just knowin' that you were mine, all mine


So, if you want to love me
Then, darlin', don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain


Do you need some time on your own?
Do you need some time all alone?
Oh, everybody needs some time on their own
Oh, don't you know you need some time all alone?


I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you, woah-woah




Sometimes, I need some time on my own
Sometimes, I need some time all alone
Oh, everybody needs some time on their own
Oh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, oh yeah
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame


So, never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain

Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one, you're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one, you're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one, you're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
