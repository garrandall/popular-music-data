Return to sender
Return to sender
I gave a letter to the postman
He put it his sack
Bright and early next morning
He brought my letter back

(She wrote upon it:)
Return to sender, address unknown
No such number, no such zone
We had a quarrel, a lover's spat

I write I'm sorry but my letter keeps coming back
So then I dropped it in the mailbox
And sent it special D
Bright and early next morning it came right back to me

(She wrote upon it:)
Return to sender, address unknown
No such person, no such zone

This time I'm gonna take it myself and put it right in her hand
And if it comes back the very next day then I'll understand

(The writing on it)

Return to sender, address unknown
No such number, no such zone
Return to sender
Return to sender
Return to sender
