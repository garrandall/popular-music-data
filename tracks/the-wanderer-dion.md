Oh well, I'm the type of guy who will never settle down
Where pretty girls are, well you know that I'm around
I kiss 'em and I love 'em cause to me they're all the same
I hug 'em and I squeeze 'em; they don't even know my name


They call me the wanderer
Yeah, the wanderer
I roam around, around, around


Oh well, there's Flo on my left arm and there's Mary on my right
And Janie is the girl well that I’ll be with tonight
And when she asks me which one I love the best
I tear open my shirt and I show her "Rosie" on my chest


Cause I'm the wanderer
Yeah, the wanderer
I roam around, around, around


Oh well, I roam from town to town
I go through life without a care
And I'm as happy as a clown
I with my two fists of iron but I'm going nowhere


Oh yeah, I’m the type of guy that likes to roam around
I’m never in one place, I roam from town to town
And when I find myself a-fallin' for some girl
Yeah, I hop right into that car of mine and drive around the world


Yeah I'm the wanderer
Yeah, the wanderer
I roam around, around, around


Oh yeah, I'm the type of guy that likes to roam around
I'm never in one place, I roam from town to town
And when I find myself a-fallin' for some girl
I hop right into that car of mine and drive around the world


Yeah, cause I'm a wanderer
Yeah, a wanderer
I roam around, around, around, around, around, around
Cause I'm a wanderer
Yeah, a wanderer
I roam around, around, around, around, around, around, around
Cause I'm a wanderer
I'm, a wanderer
I roam around, around, around, around
