Time, time, time, see what's become of me
While I looked around for my possibilities
I was so hard to please

But look around, the leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

Hear the Salvation Army band
Down by the riverside, it's bound to be a better ride
Than what you've got planned
Carry your cup in your hand

And look around you, leaves are brown now
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

Hang on to your hopes, my friend
That's an easy thing to say, but if your hopes should pass away
Simply pretend that you can build them again

Look around, the grass is high
The fields are ripe
It's the springtime of my life

Ah, seasons change with the scenery
Weaving time in a tapestry
Won't you stop and remember me
At any convenient time?
Funny how my memory skips
While looking over manuscripts of unpublished rhyme
Drinking my vodka and lime

I look around, leaves are brown now
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

Look around, leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground
Look around, leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground
Look around, leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground
