Girl you cut those jeans just right
I know you didn't buy 'em like that
So baby don't even try that
You dance, Oh you move
Like there ain't nobody watchin'
But girl you know I'm watchin'


Don't lie, you've got it all figured out
That smile has got me spinnin' around
Don't even try actin' like it ain't no thing
Cause I can see you move a little closer, closer
Girl I gotta get to get to know ya, know ya
Everything about ya makes me want ya, want ya
Know what you're doin baby don't ya, don't ya


You've been lookin' over here all night
And When I look, you look away
Oh I love the little games you play
Yea I bet you didn't mean to brush my hand when you walked by me
Like you didn't mean to drive me crazy


Don't lie, you've got it all figured out
That smile has got me spinnin' around
Don't even try actin' like it ain't no thing
Cause I can see you move a little closer, closer
Girl I gotta get to get to know ya, know ya
Everything about ya makes me want ya, want ya
Know what you're doin baby don't ya, don't ya


Wanna get outta here and let me show ya
How good it would feel to hold ya
Put your pretty little head on my shoulder
Oh yea


Don't lie, you've got it all figured out
That smile has got me spinnin' around
Don't even try actin' like it ain't no thing
Cause I can see you move a little closer, closer
Girl I gotta get to get to know ya, know ya
Everything about ya makes me want ya, want ya
Know what you're doin baby don't ya, don't ya
