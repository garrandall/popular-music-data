Rachel:
We could just go home right now
Or maybe we could stick around
For just one more drink, oh yeah
Get another bottle out
Let's shoot the breeze
Sit back down
For just one more drink, oh yeah

Here's to us
Here's to love
All the times
That we messed up
Here's to you
Fill the glass
Cause the last few days
Have gone too fast
So lets give em hell
Wish everybody well
Here's to us
Here's to us

We stuck it out this far together
Put our dreams through the shredder
Let's toast cause things got better
And everything could change like that
And all these years go by so fast
But nothing lasts forever

Rachel with New Directions Girls:
Here's to us
Here's to love
All the times
That we messed up
Here's to you
Fill the glass

Rachel:
Cause the last few nights
Have gone too fast

Rachel with New Directions Girls:
If they give you hell
Tell em to forget themselves
Here's to us
Here's to us

Rachel with New Directions Boys harmonizing:
Here's to all that we kissed
And to all that we missed
To the biggest mistakes
That we just wouldn't trade

Rachel with New Directions Girls:
To us breaking up
Without us breaking down
To whatever's comin' our way

Rachel:
Here's to us
Here's to us!

New Directions Girls:
Here's to us
Here's to love
All the times
That we messed up

Rachel with New Directions Girls:
Here's to you
Fill the glass

Rachel:
Cause the last few days
Have gone too fast

Rachel with New Directions Girls:
So let's give em hell
Wish everybody well

Rachel:
Well!

New Directions Girls:
Here's to us
Here's to love

Rachel with New Directions Girls:
All the times
That we messed up
Here's to you
Fill the glass
Cause the last few nights
Have gone too fast
If they give you hell
Tell em forget themselves

Rachel:
Here's to us

New Directions Girls:
Here's to us

Rachel:
Oh here's to us

New Directions Girls:
Here's to us

Rachel with New Directions Girls:
Here's to us
Here's to love
(New Directions: Here's to us)

Rachel:
Wish everybody well

Rachel with New Directions Girls:
Here's to us
Here's to love
Here's to us

Rachel:
Here's to us
