Gee, I saw the sweetest girl last night
I wonder if she even noticed me
Gee, I wish I hadn't been so shy
I guess I missed the chance of a lifetime
Oh Gee-ee
I only saw her for a little while
I held my breath as she passed so close to me
Gee, I wanted to catch her with a smile
All I could do was stand there
Oh Gee-ee
One brief moment was all I had
I tingled with excitement for more
But one precious moment was all I had
To find just what I'd been searchin' for
Gee, I hardly closed my eyes last night
With her on my mind, I just couldn't fall asleep
Why did I ever let her out of sight
I guess I missed the chance of a lifetime
Oh Gee-ee
I guess I missed the chance of a lifetime
Oh Gee-ee
