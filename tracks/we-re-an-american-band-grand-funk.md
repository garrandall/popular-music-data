Like this...

On the road for forty days,
Last night in little rock put me in a haze.
Sweet, sweet connie -- doin her act,
She stole the whole show and thats a natural fact.
Up all night with freddy king,
I got to tell you pokers his thing.
A-booze n ladies treat me right,
As long as we can make it to the show tonight.

Were an american band.
Were an american band.
Were coming to your town, well help you party it down.
Were an american band.

Four young chaquitas in omaha,
Was waitin for the band to return from the show.
Feelin good, feelin right, its saturday night,
The hotel detective -- he was out-a-sight.
Now, these fine ladies, they had a plan,
They was out to hang with me and the band.
They said, come on, dudes, lets get it on,
And Poison tore that hotel down.

Were an american band.
Were an american band.
Were coming to your town, well help you party it down.
Were an american band.

Were an american band.
Were an american band.
Were coming to your town, well help you party it down.
Were an american band.

Come on C.C. play that thing.

Were an american band.
Were an american band.
Were coming to your town, were gonna party down.
Were an american band.

Were an american band.
Were an american band.
Were coming to your town, were gonna party down.
Were an american band.

Were an american band, ooo-ooo.
Were an american band, ooo-ooo.
Were an american band, ooo-ooo.
