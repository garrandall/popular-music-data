Mercedes:
There's a boy I know
He's the one I dream of, ooh-ooh
Looks into my eyes
Takes me to the clouds above, mmm

Oh, I lose control (Santana: Ooh-ooh)
Can't seem to (with Santana: get enough, uh huh)
When I wake from dreaming (Kurt and Santana: Ooh-ooh)
Tell me is it (with Kurt and Santana: really love, aha)

Rachel (Kurt, Mercedes, and Santana):
(Ooh) How will I know (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I (with Kurt, Mercedes, and Santana: know)
(Ooh) How will I know (Love can be deceiving)
How will I (with Kurt, Mercedes, and Santana: know)

Kurt, Mercedes, Rachel, and Santana (Mercedes and Santana):
How will I know (if he really loves me?)
I say a prayer (with every) heart beat
I fall in love (whenever we meet)
I'm asking you ('cause you know about these things)
How will I know (if he's thinking of me?)
I try to phone (but I'm too shy) (Kurt and Rachel: Can't speak)
Falling in love (is all bitter sweet)
This love is strong (why do I feel weak, oh, wake me)

Mercedes (with Kurt, Rachel, and Santana):
I'm shaking (Santana: Ooh-ooh)
I wish I had you (with Santana: near me now, uh huh)
(Said there's no) mistaking (Kurt, Rachel, and Santana: Ooh-ooh)
What I feel is (really love) (Kurt, Rachel, and Santana: Aha)
Oh, tell me

Kurt and Rachel:
If he loves me (Mercedes and Santana: If he loves me)
If he loves me

Kurt, Mercedes, Rachel, and Santana:
If he loves me not (Mercedes: Oh-oh, yeah)

Kurt and Rachel:
If he loves me (Mercedes and Santana: If he loves me)
If he loves me

Kurt, Mercedes, Rachel, and Santana:
If he loves me not

Rachel:
Oh! How will I know!

Kurt, Mercedes, and Santana:
How will I know

Mercedes and Santana:
If he's thinking of me

Kurt, Mercedes, Rachel, and Santana (Mercedes and Santana):
I try to phone (but I'm too shy) (Kurt and Rachel: Can't speak)
Falling in love (is all bitter sweet)
This love is strong (why do I feel weak?)

Mercedes:
How will I know

Kurt, Rachel, and Santana (Mercedes):
How will I know if he really loves me? (How will I know, hey, how will I know)
I say a prayer with every heart beat (How will I know, ooh, how will I know)
I fall in love whenever we meet (How will I know, yeah, how will I know)
I'm asking you cause you know about these things (How will I know, yeah)

Kurt, Mercedes, Rachel, and Santana:
How will I know
