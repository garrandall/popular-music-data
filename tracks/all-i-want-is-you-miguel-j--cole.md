Damn, cold world
I never thought I'd see that day that youâre my old girl
Now Iâm stuck here hollering at old girl
Got one, got two, three four girls
Shotgun in the drop made a right
Hut one, hut two, told them niggas take a hike
Then itâs on to the next one, on, on to the next one
Hard to move on when you always regret one


I wonder sometimes
I wonder if I was wrong
Tryna do right by you got me here
Now all I am is alone

'Cause her eyes
And those hips
And that (ass)
Donât compare, at all (no)
And at best, all they do is distract me
But now, deep down, when I face it


All I want is you
All I want is you (now)
All I want is you now
Now that youâre gone, gone, gone


'Cause being your friend was killing me softly
Hear voices
Wonder where I went wrong
It was my fault, in the wrong time,
I wonder so often, regret gets exhausting

'Cause her eyes
And those hips
And that (ass)
Donât compare, at all (no)
And at best, all they do is distract me
But now, deep down, when I face it


All I want is you (mhm)
All I want is you (now)
All I want is you now (sugar)
Now that youâre gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
All I want is you (mhm)
All I want is you (now)
All I want is you now (baby)
Now that youâre gone, gone, gone, gone, gone


'Cause they don't smile
Or smell like you
And they don't make me laugh
Or even cook like you
And they don't photograph
Nah, they don't sex like you
Let's face it, I can't replace it
That's why all I want is you now...


I hit the club when you left me thinking that could heal shit
Trying to celebrate my Independence Day, Will Smith
Baby girl who Iâm kidding
Still sick, real shit
All my new bitches seem to get old real quick
And could it be, you everything that these plain bitches couldnât be
Is it a sign from the Lord that I shouldnât be
Lost in the Player way sorta get old to me
Got me on layaway, girl you gotta a hold on me
I say Iâm wrong, you say come again
Damn, said I was wrong look donât rub it in
I got a lot on my mind
Got a flock full of dimes
Like a line full of hoes,
Look how they coming in
Just saying
Donât wanna have me then somebody will
Iâm playing
Weight on my chest like I body build
Iâm praying
You ainât content with trying to do your thang
Hey come back baby boomerang


That's why
All I want is you now (mhhm)
All I want is you now (yeah)
All I want is you now (sugar)
Now that youâre gone, gone, gone, gone
You know that you're gone (I want you back)
