Damn
Damn
Heheheh
Ugh


Damn, Cole World
I never thought I see that day that you my old girl
Now I’m stuck here hollerin' at ol' girl
Got one, got two, three, four girls
Shotgun in the drop made a right
Hut-one, hut-two, told them hoes take a hike
Then it’s on to the next—on—on to the next one
Hard to move on when you always regret one


I wonder sometimes
I wonder if I was wrong
Tryna do right by you got me here
Now all I am is alone


Cause her eyes, and those hips
And that ass, don’t compare, at all, no
And at best, all they do is distract me but now
Deep down, when I face it


All I want is you
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now
Now that you’re gone, gone, gone


'Cause being your friend is killin' me softly
Hear voices, wonder where I went wrong
It was my fault and the wrong time
I wonder so often, regret gets exhaustin'


Cause her eyes, and those hips
And that ass, don’t compare, at all, no
And at best, all they do is distract me but now
Deep down, when I face it


All I want is you, mmh
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now, sugar
Now that you’re gone, gone, gone
All I want is you, oh-oh, oh
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now, baby
Now that you’re gone, gone, gone, gone, gone


Cause they don’t smile, huh, or smell like you
And they don’t make me laugh, or even cook like you
And they don’t photograph, nah, they don't sex like you
Let's face it (yeah) I can’t replace it (yeah)
That's why all I want is you now


I hit the club when you left me thinking that could heal shit
Tryna celebrate my Independence Day, Will Smith
Baby girl, who I’m kidding? Still sick, real shit
All my new hoes seem to get old real quick
And could it be, you everything that these plain bitches couldn’t be?
Is it a sign from the Lord that I shouldn’t be?
Lost in the player way, sorta get old to me
Got me on layaway, girl you got a hold on me
I say, "I’m wrong", you say, "Come again?"
Damn, said I was wrong, look don’t rub it in
I got a lot on my mind, got a flock full of dimes
Like a line full of hoes, how they coming in
Just sayin', don’t wanna have me then somebody will
I’m playin', weight on my chest like I body build
I’m prayin', you ain’t content with tryna do your thang
And come back baby, boomerang, 'rang, huh


That's why all I want is you now
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now, sugar
Now that you’re gone, gone, gone, gone, gone


Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, now that you're gone, gone, gone
I want you back
