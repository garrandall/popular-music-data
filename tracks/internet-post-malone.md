I just seen lil mama on Instagram and she flashin'
Don't care about your puppy, just that ass and them breasts
Oh girl, you a model? Damn, I never would've guessed it
And if you tryna throw out all them vibes, I'ma catch 'em

The lifestyle we live is just too dangerous
Paranoid, since I been leakin' my shit
Wonder if it'll come out on the web
And I can't help all these bitches on my dick
Taking the photo and posting that shit
Coming home late and I crawl into bed
She always be askin' me, "Where have you been?"
Whoa

The world has gone to shit and we all know that
People freakin' out like, "Hit the Prozac"
Leon DeChino shorts got all the blogs mad
Well, fuck the internet and you can quote that, whoa

Instalove, well if ignorance is bliss, then don't wake me up
And I'll probably be the last to know
'Cause I don't get on the internet no more
Instalove, well if ignorance is bliss, then don't wake me up
And I'll probably be the last to know
'Cause I don't get on the internet no more
