Hard days I'm travelling
Alone for too long
Oh, I'm missing you
I'm always somewhere
That I never belong
Oh, I'm missing you
I'm moving so fast now
It doesn't seem true
Oh, I'm missing you
I'm getting closer
But I don't know what to
Oh, I'm missing you.

Oho, If I had you beside me
Then I just might sleep through the night
Your love is the promise that guides me
All of the days of my life.

This life I'm living's
Getting so hard to feel
Oh, I'm missing you
The days are empty
And the nights are unreal
Oh, I'm missing you

Oho, If I had you beside me
Then I just might sleep through the night
Your love is the promise that guides me
All of the days of my life
All of the days of my life.

Hard days I'm travelling
Alone for too long
Oh, I'm missing you
I'm always somewhere
That I never belong
Oh, I'm missing you.

Oho, If I had you beside me
Then I just might sleep through the night
Your love is the promise that guides me
All of the days of my life
All of the days of my life.
All of the days of my life.
