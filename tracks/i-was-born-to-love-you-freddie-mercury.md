An amazing feeling coming through...

I was born to love you with every single beat of my heart
Yes I was born to take care of you
Every single day of my life

You are the one for me, I am the man for you
You were made for me, you're my ecstasy
If I was given every opportunity, I'd kill for your love
So take a chance with me, let me romance with you
I'm caught in a dream and my dreams come true
Its so hard to believe this is happening to me
An amazing feeling coming through

I was born to love you with every single beat of my heart
Yes I was born to take care of you
Every single day of my life

I wanna love you, I love every little thing about you
I wanna love you love you love you
(Born) to love you (born) to love you yes (Born) I was born to love you
(Born) to love you (born) to love you every single day of my life
I was born to take care of you, every single day of my life

Alright! hey! hey!
Every single day of my life

I was born to love you with every single beat of my heart
Yeah I was born to take care of you honey, every single day of my life
