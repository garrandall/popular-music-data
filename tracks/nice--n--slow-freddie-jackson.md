Hey, girl, we're gonna take it nice and slow
Hey, girl, we're gonna take it nice and slow
Oh, girl, let it flow


I'm so glad we took the time
To look into each other's mind
We didn't grow too far too fast
And now we know each other well
The things that only time can tell
We've got a love that's gonna last


'Cause we were friends
Before we were lovers
And isn't that the way it should be? Uh-huh
Baby, don't change a single thing


Let's take it nice and slow, steady as we go
From now on it's gonna be smooth, smooth sailing
Nice and slow, let it flow
And hold on tight to love


So much we have to overcome
And it looked like love was on the run
But we held on, our heads were clear
(We held on to the feelin')
And then just like a flash of light
We knew that the time was right (Time was right)
We made our move and love was there


'Cause we were friends, mmm
Before we were lovers
And what we have is so good, uh-huh
I wouldn't change it if I could


Let's take it nice and slow (Nice and slow), steady as we go (Whoa-oh)
From now on it's gonna be smooth, smooth sailing
Nice and slow, let it flow
And hold on tight to love


So much we learned from talking
Before we danced in the night
And only then can love take flight
Baby, let's take our time
Ooh, oh yeah
Mmm, yeah, yeah


'Cause we were friends, oh, yes
Before we were lovers
And isn't that the way it should be? Uh-huh, girl
Baby, don't change a single thing


Let's take it nice and slow (Whoa, whoa), steady as we go (Oh)
From now on it's gonna be smooth, smooth sailing
Nice and slow (Oh), let it flow (Oh)
And hold on tight to love
Nice and slow (Oh baby), steady as we go (Oh girl)
From now on it's gonna be smooth, smooth sailing
Nice and slow (Oh girl), let it flow (Oh yeah)
And hold on tight to love


Come on, girl
(Take our time) Can we take our time lovin' each other?
Just take our time
(Take our time) I wanna hear you say, ha, oh
There's nothing like the love we share
(Take our time) Oh, hoo, yeah
We've got a lifetime together, take our time
(Take our time) Let's take it nice and slow
Oh, take our time (Take our time)
