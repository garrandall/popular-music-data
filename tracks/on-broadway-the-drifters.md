They say the neon lights are bright on Broadway (on Broadway)
They say there's always magic in the air (on Broadway)
But when you're walkin' down the street
And you ain't had enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere (on Broadway)

They say the chicks are somethin' else on Broadway (on Broadway)
But lookin' at them just gives me the blues (on Broadway)
'Cause how you gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes (on Broadway)

They say that I won't last too long on Broadway (on Broadway)
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home they say (on Broadway)
But they're dead wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this here guitar
And I won't quit till I'm a star on Broadway (on Broadway)

But they're dead wrong I know they are
'Cause I can play this here guitar
And I won't quit till I'm a star on Broadway (on Broadway)
On Broadway (on Broadway)
On Broadway (on Broadway)
On Broadway (on Broadway)
