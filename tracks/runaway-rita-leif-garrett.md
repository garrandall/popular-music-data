See how I'm walking
See how I'm talking
Notice everything in me
Feel the need
Oh feel, feel the need in me
I need you by my side
To be my guide
Can't you see my arms are open wide
Feel the need
Oh feel, feel the need in me

I need your love
Everyday I need
Love
Everyday I want
Love
Without your sweet, sweet love I'd rather die
I need your love
I need it constantly
Love
Your love takes care of me
Love
Your love is better to me than apple pie

Just put your hand in mine
Love me all the time
The proof you will plainly see
Feel the need
Oh feel, feel the need in me
I need your only kiss
To my heart in bliss
You make me what I need to be
Feel the need
Oh feel, feel the need in me

I need you by my side
To be my guide
Can't you see my arms are open wide
Feel the need
Oh feel, feel the need in me

I need your love
Everyday I need
Love
Everyday I want
Love
With out your sweet, sweet love I'd rather die
I need your love
I need it constantly
Love
Your love takes care of me
Love
Your love is better to me than cherry pie

See how I'm walking
See how I'm talking
Notice everything in me
Feel the need
Oh feel, feel the need in me
