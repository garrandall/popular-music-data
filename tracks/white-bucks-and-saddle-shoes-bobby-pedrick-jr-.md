White bucks and saddle shoes
That's what the kids all choose
Jeanos and slacks of course
Oh, yes, they sure look boss
Gettin' ready to, go steady are
White bucks and saddle shoes

Button down shirt and a crew neck sweater
Lets all the kids look so much better
Crewcut and a ponytail
Do the crawl just like a snail
Gettin' ready to, go steady are
White bucks and saddle shoes

Two straws and a bottle of pop
Winning first prize doing the bop
Ten kids piled into Daddy's car
Everybody's chewin' a candy bar
Well, their white bucks and saddle shoes
That's the style that's makin' the news
Ivy league at all at best
In the north and the south
And the east and the west
Gettin' ready to, go steady are
White bucks and saddle shoes

Two straws and a bottle of pop
Winning first prize doing the bop
Ten kids piled into Daddy's car
Everybody's chewing a candy bar
Well, their white bucks and saddle shoes
That's the style that's makin' the news
Ivy league at all at best
In the north and the south
And the east and the west

Gettin' ready to, go steady are
White bucks and saddle shoes
Gettin' ready to, go steady are
Joe's white bucks and Mary's saddle shoes
