All that I have is all that you've given me
Did you never worry that I'd come to depend on you?
I gave you all the love I had in me
Now I find you've lied and I can't believe it's true

Wrapped in her arms I see you across the street
(I see you across the street)
And I can't help but wonder if she knows what's going on
You talk of love but you don't know how it feels
When you realize that you're not the only one

Oh you'd better stop
Before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop
Before you go and break my heart
Oh you'd better stop

Time after time I've tried to walk away
But it's not that easy when your soul is torn in two
So I just resign myself to it every day
Now all I can do is to leave it up to you

Oh you'd better stop
Before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop
Before you go and break my heart
Oh you'd better stop
If you love me
(You will remember)
Now's the time to be sorry
(That day forever)
I won't believe that you'd walk out on me

Oh you'd better stop
Before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop
Before you go and break my heart

Oh you'd better stop
Baby stop
Oh you'd better stop
Oh stop
Baby stop
Baby stop
You'd better stop
Stop, stop stop
Stop
You'd better stop
