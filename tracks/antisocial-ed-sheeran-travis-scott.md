All you cool people, you better leave now 'cause it's about to happen

Friday night and I'm riding solo (Yeah)
When I touch down, keep it on the low-low (It's lit)
I don't mess with your energy (No)

No photos, so antisocial but I don't care
Don't give a damn, I'm gonna smoke here
Got a bottle in my hand, bring more though
Got my hat low, don't talk to me (Straight up)

I've been down, give me some space
You don't know what's in my brain
Music loud, easing my pain
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something, on something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night (Straight up)

Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something, on something I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night

I need room, I need room, where you standing way too close
You might catch fumes, might catch fumes when I zoom, when I zoom past
I wake up by myself right past noon, right past noon, then I'm doomed
(Hit the ground, I'm movin' through ya)

Hennessy's drowning all of my issues
Right before I leave she give me more than just a "Miss you" (Yeah)
That thing got more back just like my engine, I can't hit it (No more)
Seen a vision and oh boy did we commit (It's lit)

I've been lost out inner space
You left me right in my place
I put you down on my name
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something, on something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night (Straight up)

Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something, on something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night

(Don't touch me, yeah)
