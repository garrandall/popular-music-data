Do you wanna dance under the moon light;
Squeeze me all through the night?
Oh, baby, do you wanna dance?

Do you wanna dance and hold my hand;
Tell me I'm your lover man?
Oh, baby, do you wanna dance?

Do you wanna dance and make romance?
C'mon pretty baby and take a chance.
Hey, baby, baby, do you wanna dance?

(Do you...) Do you wanna dance?
(Do you...) Do you wanna dance?
(Do you...) Do you, do you wanna dance?

Do you wanna dance under the moon light;
Squeeze me all through the night?
Oh, baby, do you wanna dance?

(Do you...) Do you wanna dance?
(Do you...) Do you wanna dance?
(Do you...) Do you do you wanna dance?
(Do you...) Do you wanna dance?

Do you wanna dance? (Do you wanna dance?)
Will you take a chance?(Do you wanna dance?)
Will hold my hand? (Do you wanna dance?)
At least let me be your lover man! (Do you wanna dance?)
Can I hold your hand? (Do you wanna dance?)
Let me be your lover man! (Do you wanna dance?)
Can I hold your hand? (Do you wanna dance?)
