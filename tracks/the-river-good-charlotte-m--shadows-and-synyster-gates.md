As I walk through the valley
Of the shadow of L.A
The footsteps that were next to me
Have gone their separate ways
I've seen enough now to know that beautiful things
Don't always stay that way
I've done enough now to know this beautiful place
Isn't everything they say


I heard that evil comes disguised
Like the city of angels
I'm walking towards the light


Baptized in the river
I've seen a vision of my life and I want to be delivered
In the city was a sinner
I've done a lot of things wrong but I swear I'm a believer
Like the prodigal son, I was out on my own
Now I'm trying to find my way back home
Baptized in the river
I'm delivered, I'm delivered


You're from a small town, you're going to grow up fast
Underneath these lights
Down in Hollywood, on the boulevard
The dead come back to life
To the praying Mother and the worried Father
Let your children go
If they come back they'll come home stronger
And if they don't you'll know


They say that evil comes disguised
Like the city of angels
I'm walking towards the light


Baptized in the river
I've seen a vision of my life and I want to be delivered
In the city was a sinner
I've done a lot of things wrong but I swear I'm a believer
Like the prodigal son, I was out on my own
Now I'm trying to find my way back home
Baptized in the river
I'm delivered, I'm delivered


Baptized in the river (On my own)
Baptized in the river (On my own)
I wanna be delivered
On my own
On my own
Baptized in the river (On my own)
I wanna be delivered
Baptized in the river (On my own)
I wanna be delivered
Baptized in the river (On my own)
I wanna be delivered
I confess I'm a sinner
I've seen a vision of my life and I want to be delivered
