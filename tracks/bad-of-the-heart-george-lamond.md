Because you're bad of the heart

How could you be so cruel
You treat me like a fool
After all I did for you
You cut me like a blade
My trust is slowly fading
Now I don't know what to do
I thought that when you gave me love
My life would start to change
Instead I saw that I was wrong
My life was re-aranged
How I wonder why
You just put my love aside
You threw me in the gutter and you left me there to lie

Bad of the heart
You never wanted to start
Cause your just bad of the heart
You never played the game to smart
Cause you know your bad

When I was by your side
You kissed and told me lies
You hurt me each and everyday

I made it through the night
Lying to myself, why did it have to be this way
I thought that when you gave me love
My life would start to change
Instead I saw that I was wrong
My life was re-aranged
How I wonder why
You just put my love aside
You threw me in the gutter and you left me there to lie

Bad of the heart
You never wanted to start
Cause your just bad of the heart
Now your tearing me apart

Bad of the heart
You never wanted to start
Cause your just bad of the heart
You really didn't want me baby, oh girl

Bad of the heart
You didn't really want me baby
You never really needed me
Cause your just bad of the heart
Repeat
