Between a rock
Between a rock and a hard place
There's a beating heart
Watching the lights go down on my world
Stoney faced
Letting the rope slip though my fingers
Ain't nothin' straight, always a riddle
Caught up in the middle of the party line
I got a brick but I can't find a window
Take me to your shelter...
Between a rock
Between a rock and a hard place (you better lay your money down)
You'll never stop
What you started in the first place
Between a rock
You gotta roll with the punches baby
Between a rock and a hard place...
There's so many words
You place your bet you take your chances
The dealer pays
But he'll never let you leave the table
They're gonna take you lock, stock and barrel
Down to the knuckle, down on your luck
And when they've stripped you of all resistance
You can take you place...
Between a rock
Between a rock and a hard place (you gotta lay your money down)
You'll never stop
What you started in the first place
Between a rock
You gotta roll with the punches baby
Between a rock and a hard place...

It'll take all your money
We think we like it here
Between a rock (you gotta roll with the punches baby)
Between a rock and a hard place
