Do do do
Down dooby doo down down, comma comma
Down dooby doo down down, comma comma
Down dooby doo down down
Breaking up is hard to do

Don't take your love away from me
Don't you leave my heart in misery
If you go then I'll be blue
'Cause breaking up is hard to do

Remember when you held me tight
And you kissed me all through the night
Think of all that we've been through
And breaking up is hard to do

They say that breaking up is hard to do
Now I know, I know that it's true
Don't say that this is the end
Instead of breaking up I wish that we were making up again

I beg of you don't say goodbye
Can't we give our love another try?
Come on baby, let's start anew
'Cause breaking up is hard to do

(They say that breaking up is hard to do)
Now I know I know that it's true
(Don't say that this is the end)
Instead of breaking up I wish that we were making up again

I beg of you don't say goodbye
Can't we give our love another try?
Come on baby, let's start anew
Since breaking up is hard to do

Down dooby doo down down, comma comma
Down dooby doo down down, comma comma
Down dooby doo down down
