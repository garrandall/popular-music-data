Shawty, I'mma only tell you this once, you the illest
(ba, ba-da, da, doh)
And for your loving, I'mma die hard like Bruce Willis
(ba, ba-da, da, doh)
You got spark, you, you got spunk
You, you got something all the girls want
You're like a candy store and I'm a toddler
You got me wanting more and m-m-more of
Your love, your love (yeah)
Your love, your love (yeah)
Your love, your love (yeah)
Your love, your love (yeah)
Your love, your love
Your love, your love
Your love, your love
Your love, your love


Uh, uh, yo, he the type to pop tags and be cockin' the brim
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym
And he keep a doo-rag, keep the wave on swim
W-w-waves on swim so they hate on him
Anyway, I think I met him sometime before
In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree
'S-s-s' on my chest 'cause I'm ready to save him
Ready to give up on anybody that plays him
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him
When he call me mama, lil mama, I call him baby


Shawty, I'mma only tell you this once, you the illest
(ba, ba-da, da, doh)
And for your loving, I'mma die hard like Bruce Willis
(ba, ba-da, da, doh)
You got spark, you, you got spunk
You, you got something all the girls want
You're like a candy store and I'm a toddler
You got me wanting more and m-m-more of
Your love, your love (yeah)
Your love, your love (yeah)
Your love, your love (yeah)
Your love, your love (yeah)
Your love, your love
Your love, your love
Your love, your love
Your love, your love


He the type to keep a couple hundred grand in a rubber band
Just left Money Gram in the lemon Lam'
Hot damn, make me scream like Summer Jam
I mean that nigga must be from the motherland
Anyway, I think I met him in the sky
When I was a Geisha he was a Samurai
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly
'S-s-s' on my chest let me get my cape on
He's so thugged out - Ghostface and Raekwon
"Konvict" just like Akon
'Cause you know the Snitches be putting the Jake on


Shawty, I'mma only tell you this once, you the illest
(ba, ba-da, da, doh)
And for your loving, I'mma die hard like Bruce Willis
(ba, ba-da, da, doh)
You got spark, you, you got spunk
You, you got something all the girls want
You're like a candy store and I'm a toddler
You got me wanting more and m-m-more of
Your love, your love (yeah)
Your love, your love (yeah)
Your love, your love (yeah)
Your love, your love (yeah)
Your love, your love
Your love, your love
Your love, your love
Your love, your love


Find me in the dark
I'll be in the stars
Find me in your heart
I'm in need of your love
Your love, your love
Your love
Baby, you're the illest
Your love
Your love
