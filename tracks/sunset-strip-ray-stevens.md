Sunset Strip
Sunset Strip
My soul trip
Sunset Strip

Some people say you're plastic
Well, I guess my soul's elastic
'Cause I bend with every curve in your sidewalk
Just groovin' along
Feeling right at home
Listening to the music of your children talk

Sunset Strip
(Something I dream about you)
Sunset Strip
(Something I dream about you)
My soul trip
(You got a way about you)
Sunset Strip
(What can I say about you?)

Well, you see more friendly faces
Than any other places
And the warm glow of your night lights cast a spell on me
All the happy hearts are here
With their minds all free and clear
And the whole idea seems to fit so well on me

Sunset Strip
(Something I dream about you)
Sunset Strip
(Something I dream about you)
My soul trip
(You got a way about you)
Sunset Strip
(What can I say about you?)

Sunset Strip
