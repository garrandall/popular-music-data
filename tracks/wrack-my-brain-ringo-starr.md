Wrack my brain, wrack my brain,
Till my head's filled with pain,
Wrack my brain.

All dried up, I'm all dried up,
All I have's this empty cup,
All dried up.

What I have, you don't want,
What you want, I can't give.
I got out of touch with you and yours,
The way that you live.

I try to do my best for you,
While the sky pours down the rain,
Wrack my brain.

With a will there's a way,
But there's no way I can see,
Coming up with something you'd enjoy
As much as tv

All the same, I play the game,
Up and down old memory lane,
Wrack my brain, (wrack my brain)
Till my head is filled with pain,
Wrack my brain, (wrack my brain)
While I slowly go insane,
Wrack my brain. (wrack my brain)
