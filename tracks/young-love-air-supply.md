Lately all my thoughts have gone to you
You know that's true
Sometimes I feel just a word away
You'll say oh how I miss you too I do

Time is tight I'm lost for words
That's not like me
Only your eyes could know the way that I feel
And how much I need you now with me


Young love so strong has never been a part of me
Young love hold on we're feeling it now is this the way it's meant to be

I know I'll be the one to lose if I'm so wrong
Don't be afraid to put your heart on the line
I'll take you where I know you belong

Take my thoughts away beyond the things we see
Sometimes it seems just a word away
You'll say oh how I really feel it should be
