Well the times are getting hard for you, little girl
I'm a humming and a strumming all over god's world
You can't remember when you got your last meal
And you don't know just how a woman feels

You didn't know what rock and roll was
Until you met my drummer on a grey tour bus
I got there in the nick of time
Before he got his hands across your state line

Now it's the middle of the night on the open road
And the heater don't work and it's oh so cold
You're looking tired, you're looking kind of beat
The rhythm of the street sure knocks you off your feet

You didn't know how rock and roll looked
Until you caught your sister with the guys from the group
Half way home in the parking lot
By the look in her eye she was giving what she got

My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby

Woman you're a mess going to die in your sleep
There's blood on my amp and my Les Paul's beat
Can't keep you home, you're messing around
My best friend told me you're the best lick in town

You didn't know that rock and roll burned
So you bought a candle and you lived and you learned
You got the rhythm you got the speed
Mama's little baby likes it short and sweet

My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby

I didn't know you had a rock and roll record
Until i saw your picture on another guy's jacket
You told me I was the only one
But look at you now, it's dark and you're gone

My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby

So shy, so shy, so shy, so shy
So shy, so shy, so shy, so shy
