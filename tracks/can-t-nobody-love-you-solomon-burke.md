Can't nobody love you, baby
Like I'm loving you right now
'Cause they don't know how to love you like I do
And can't nobody talk to you, babe
Like I'm talking to you right now
I just don't know how to talk to you like I said I do

I'm gonna love you in the morning
I'm gonna love you through the night
And I won't stop loving you, baby
'Cause this way everything's alright

Can't nobody love you
Like I'm loving you right now
They just don't know how to love you like I do

And, oh love
Can't nobody kiss you, baby
Like I'm kissing you right now
I just don't know how to kiss you like I said I do

And can't nobody
Oh, can't nobody love you
Can't nobody squeeze you
Can't nobody kiss you like I do
I just don't know how to talk to you like I said I do

Now some guys make eyes at you
But they don't do it all the time
Believe me
I'd never do it, baby
But, you know
No one's on my mind

Can't nobody love you
Like I'm loving you right now
'Cause they don't know how to love you like I do

Yeah
Children speak to me
Talk

I'm gonna love you in the morning, baby
And I'm gonna love you through the night
I won't stop
I won't stop loving you, babe
'Til everything's alright

Can't nobody love you
Like I'm loving you right now
'Cause they don't know how to love you
Don't know how to love you like I do

Oh baby, yeah
Yeah, 'cause they don;t know how
They don't know how to love you
Like I said I'll do
Oh yeah
