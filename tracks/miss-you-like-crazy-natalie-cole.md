Even though it's been so long
My love for you keeps going strong
I remember the things that we used to do
A kiss in the rain till the sun shines through
I tried to deny it, but I'm still in love with you

I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy
Ever since you went away, every hour of everyday
I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy
No matter what I say or do
There's just no getting over you

I can see the love shinning in your eyes
And it comes in such a sweet surprise
If seeing is believing, it's worth the wait
So hold on and tell me it's not too late
We're so good together
We're starting forever now

And I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy
Ever since you went away, every hour of everyday
I miss you like crazy, I miss you baby
A love like ours will never end
Just touch me and we're there again

Just one night
And we'll have the magic feeling like we used to do
Hold on tight
And whatever comes our way we're gonna make it through

If seeing is believing, it's worth the wait
So hold on and tell me it's not too late
We're so good together
We're starting forever now

And I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy
No matter what I say or do
There's just no getting over you
And I miss you, baby
I miss you baby

All the tender love you gave me
When a feeling gets this strong
I know the real thing will come along
And I miss you
I miss you like crazy baby
Only your sweet love can make me
I miss you like crazy
A love like ours will never end
Just touch me and we're there again
I miss you like crazy
I miss you like crazy
