If my love won't pull you up
And my kisses won't shake your stuff
Don't be afraid to let me know
There's other places, baby that I can go
If you don't like it, don't knock it
Somebody else, might wanna rock it
If you don't need it, don't waste it
Somebody else, might wanna taste it
Oh baby, oh baby
If my thrill, don't turn you on
And my will, is just too strong
Don't waste my time with your foolish ways
I got other things to do with my days
If you don't like it, don't knock it
Somebody else, might wanna rock it
Oh if you don't need it, don't waste it
Somebody else, might wanna taste it
Hey! Oh Lord Lord Hey!
I'm going up, I'm going down
I'm going all the way around town
I'm the one that turned you on
I'm the same one to leave you alone
Don't knock my love, don't knock my love
Don't knock it, don't knock my love
AWWW Good God almighty, it's alright
Don't knock it, don't knock my love
