Down in New Orleans...
New Orleans...

What can I tell ya
Hard for me to say
I got my mind on Louisiana
Everybody hustle now...

Sweet Louisiana...

Sho' nuff like to talk about it
Baby how you turn me out
Got to the real nitty gritty
In this fine funky city

Guess you may not believe
That mama don't wanna leave
Just the way I wanna be
New Orleans, you and me

Man so sweet, fine on his feet
And I love sweet Louisiana

Sweet Louisiana...
New Orleans...

Oh Louisiana...
Sweet Louisiana...

Beans and rice
Sho' nuff go nice
Down home in New Orleans

Sweet Louisiana...
New Orleans...
