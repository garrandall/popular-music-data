Too young to be in love they say
Too young to know the score
When will we come to the age for love
That's what we're waiting for

We know our love would pass the test
If we could have the chance
Well, any age is the age for love
The age for sweet romance

Can we explain the true way we feel
How can we show them our love is real

Someday we'll find a way to prove
We're not too young at all
They'll realize that the age for love
Is ageless after all

They'll realize that the age for love
Is ageless after all
(This is the age for love)
