Black was white, the day was night
If you said it was true
Yeah world was square
I didn't care with sweet impossible you
You changed everything about me
Now you look for some one new.

You say you can live without me
You make me love you now
Your gonna change that too
But you go on, I'll find someone
Though I don't know who
Could ever be the things I do
Sweet impossible you.

Yes, I'm the reason, for your leaving
You say that we are through
Well let it be, ah you'll never see
Sweet impossible you
You think it's right that I'm left,
Yes with my little world upside down.

You say it's easy to forget, ah but it's not easy
That's just the way it sounds
But you go on, and I'll find someone
Though I don't know who
Ah, I'd could ever be
The things I see in sweet impossible you
In sweet impossible you.

In sweet impossible you...
