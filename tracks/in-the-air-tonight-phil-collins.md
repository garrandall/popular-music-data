I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight? oh Lord, oh Lord


Well, if you told me you were drowning
I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before, my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am
Well, I was there and I saw what you did
I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin, I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies


And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Well, Iâ€™ve been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord


Well, I remember!
I remember, don't worry
How could I ever forget?
It's the first time, the last time we ever met
But I know the reason why you keep your silence up
No, you don't fool me
Well, the hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows
It's no stranger to you and me




And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord


I can feel it coming in the air tonight! Oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life! Oh Lord!
I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord!
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life! Oh Lord, Oh Lord!
I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord!
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life! Oh Lord, Oh Lord!
I can feel it in the air tonight...
