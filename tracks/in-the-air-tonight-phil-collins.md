I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord
I've been waiting for this moment all my life, oh lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord, oh lord

Well, if you told me you were drowning
I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am
Well, I was there and I saw what you did
I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off the grin, I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies, oh

I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord
I've been waiting for this moment all my life, oh lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord
I've been waiting for this moment all of my life, oh lord

Well I remember, I remember don't worry
How could I ever forget
It's the first time, the last time we ever met
But I know the reason why you keep your silence up
No you don't fool me
The hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows
It's no stranger to you or me

I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord
I've been waiting for this moment all of my life, oh lord

I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord
I've been waiting for this moment all of my life, oh lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord, oh lord, ohhh
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord, oh lord
Oh, I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord, oh lord
