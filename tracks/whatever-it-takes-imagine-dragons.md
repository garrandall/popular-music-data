First thing's first I'mma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been
Just a young gun
With a quick fuse
I was uptight
Wanna let loose

Second thing second don't you tell me what you think that I can be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea
In the foyer
Take a number
I was lightning
Before the thunder (thunder)

Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Hold me like a rip cord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the
Slip, slip
Word upon your
Lip, lip
Letter that you
Rip, rip
Break me down and build me up
Whatever it takes!

(Pain!)
You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Whatever it takes!
You broke me down, you build me up
Believer, believer
Whatever it takes!
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
Whatever it takes
You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Whatever it takes

Third things third, set a prayer for the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove
Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses

Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Hold me like a rip cord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the
Slip, slip
Word upon your
Lip, lip
Letter that you
Rip, rip
Break me down and build me up
Whatever it takes!

(Pain!)
You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Whatever it takes!
You broke me down, you build me up
Believer, believer
Whatever it takes!
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
Whatever it takes!
You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Whatever it takes!
You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Whatever it takes!
You break me down, you build me up
Believer, believer
Whatever it takes!
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
Whatever it takes!
You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Whatever it takes
