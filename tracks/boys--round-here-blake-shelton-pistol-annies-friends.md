Well the boys 'round here don't listen to The Beatles
Run ole Bocephus through a jukebox needle
At a honky-tonk, where their boots stomp
All night; what? (that's right)
Yeah, and what they call work, digging in the dirt
Gotta get it in the ground 'fore the rain come down
To get paid, to get the girl
In your four wheel drive (a country boy can survive)

Yea the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sending up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no shi-
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit

Aw heck
Red red, red, red, red, red, redneck

Well the boys 'round here, they're keeping it country
Ain't a damn one know how to do the dougie
(You don't do the dougie?) no, not in Kentucky
But these girls 'round here yep, they still love me
Yeah, the girls 'round here, they all deserve a whistle
Shakin' that sugar, sweet as Dixie crystal
They like that y'all and southern drawl
And just can't help it cause they just keep fallin'

For the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sending up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no shi-
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit

(Oh... let's ride) to the country side
(Oh, let's ride)
Down to the river side

Hey now girl, hop inside, (oh... let's ride)
Me and you gonna take a little ride to the river
Let's ride (that's right)
Lay a blanket on the ground
Kissing and the crickets is the only sound

We out of town
Have you ever got down with a
Red red, red, red, red, red, redneck?
And do you wanna get down with a
Red red, red, red, red, red, redneck?
Girl you gotta get down

With the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sending up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no shi-
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit

(Oh, let's ride)
Red red, red, red, red, red, redneck
(Oh, let's ride)
I'm one of them boys 'round here
(Oh, let's ride)
Red, red, red, red, red, red, redneck
(Oh, let's ride)

Well all I'm thinkin' 'bout is you and me, how we'll be
(Oh, let's ride)
So come on girl, hop inside
Me and you, we're gonna take a little ride
Lay a blanket on the ground
Kissing and the crickets is the only sound
We out of town (oh, let's ride)
(Oh, let's ride)
Girl you gotta get down with a
(Oh, let's ride, oh, let's ride)
Come on through the country side
(Oh, les't ride)
Down to the river side
