Raindrops falling 
Winter feels so gloomy 
Hear a knock upon my door 
Stranger calling 
Eyes that look like mine 
He said you know I've called before 

What is veiled now soon will be shown 
Come walk with me through the unknown 

Familiar stranger 
Should I know your name 
Did we meet some time ago 
I feel uncertain 
Shadows whisper to me now 
Sudden wind begins to blow 

What is veiled now soon will be shown 
Come walk with me through the unknown 
Stranger

Darkened doorways 
Strangest things can happen 
Don't know who you're talking to 
Find yourself 
When lightning strikes you now 
You could be looking back at you 

What is veiled now soon will be shown 
Come walk with me through the unknown 
What is veiled now soon will be shown 
Come walk with me through the unknown 
Stranger

Familiar stranger 
Should I know your name 
Did we meet some time ago 
Are you someone I should know 
Did we meet some time ago
