Once there was time
Just drinking country wine
We'd all sit up on the back porch
With a good ole harp of mine

Won't you bring it on back
Bring it on back
Won't you bring it on back
To this heart of mine
Bring it on back
Bring it on back
Won't you bring me some country wine

Neighbors passing by
Just bringing friendly hi's
We don't sing out in the night
Drinking sweet old apple wine

Won't you bring it on back
Bring it on back
Won't you bring it on back
To this heart of mine
Bring it on back
Bring it on back
Won't you bring me some country wine

Skies so full of stars
It doesn't matter who you are
We're gonna have us a real good good time
If'n you just bring the wine

Won't you bring it on back
Bring it on back
Won't you bring it on back
To this heart of mine
Bring it on back
Bring it on back
Won't you bring me some bring me some
Bring me some
Bring me some country wine
Bring it on back
Bring it on back
Won't you bring it on back
To this heart of mine
Bring it on back
Bring it on back
Won't you bring me some bring me some
Bring me some
Bring me some country wine
