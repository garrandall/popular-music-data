You threw me out
The night before last
And now you want me back
In your arms again
You think I'm a fool,
You treat me like dirt,
You pull the string and
Hope I will be your friend
But I know what's
On your mind,
And I'd rather be
Out in the street,
Without a dime

And I'd rather Beg, Borrow and Steal,
I'd rather Beg Borrow and Steal,
I'd rather Beg, Borrow and Steal,
Than go back to you, go back to you,
Than go back to you, go back to you,
Than go back to you, go back to you...

How long 'dja think
I'd hang around
Pretending not to see
The tricks you pulled on me
There's only so much
A man can take before
His life turns
Into a tragedy
So I'm gettin' out now
While I can,
Cause I don't want to crawl
I want to walk out like a man...

And I'd rather Beg, Borrow and Steal,
I'd rather Beg Borrow and Steal,
I'd rather Beg, Borrow and Steal,
Than go back to you, go back to you,
Than go back to you, go back to you,
Than go back to you, go back to you...
