Hanging 'round downtown by myself
And I had so much time to sit and think about myself
And there she was like double cherry pie
Yeah, there she was like disco Super Fly

I smell sex and candy hey
Who's that loungin' in my chair?
Who's that castin' devious stares in my direction?
Mama, this surely is a dream, yeah
See, mama, this surely is a dream, yeah

Hangin' 'round downtown by myself
And I've had too much caffeine and I was thinkin' 'bout myself
And there she was, she wearin' that platform double suede
There she was like disco lemonade

I smell sex and candy hey
Who's that loungin' in my chair?
Who's that castin' devious stares in my direction?
Mama, this surely is a dream, yeah
See, mama, this surely is a dream, yeah

I smell sex and candy hey
Who's that loungin' in my chair?
Who's that castin' devious stares in my direction?
Mama, this surely is a dream, yeah
See, mama, this surely is a dream, dig it
This surely is a dream, yeah
See, mama, this must be my dream
