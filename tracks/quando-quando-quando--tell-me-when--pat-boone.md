Dimmi quando tu verrai
Dimmi quando quando quando
L'anno, il giorno e l'ora in cui
Forse tu mi bacerai

Tell me when will you be mine
Tell me, quando, quando, quando
We can share a love divine
Please don't make me wait again

Every moment's a day
Every day seems a lifetime
Let me show you the way
To a joy beyond compare

I can't wait a moment more
Tell me, quando, quando, quando
Say it's me that you adore
And then, darling, tell me when

Every moment's a day
Every day seems a lifetime
Let me show you the way
To a joy beyond compare

I can't wait a moment more
Tell me, quando, quando, quando
Say it's me that you adore
And then, darling, tell me when

Oh, my darling, tell me when
Dimmi quando, tell me when
