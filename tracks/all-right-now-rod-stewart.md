There she stood in the street
Smiling from her head to her feet
I said hey what is this
Now maybe baby
Maybe you're in need for a kiss
I said hey what's your name
Maybe we can see things the same
Now don't you wait or hesitate
Let's move before they raise the parking rate

I took her home to my place
Watching every move on her face
She said look what's your game
Are you trying to put me in shame
I said slow don't talk so fast
Don't you think that love can last
She said love Lord above
Now you're trying to trick me in love

All right now
Baby it's all right now
All right now
Baby it's all right now

Who's that girl, watch that girl
Look at that girl
She lives down my street
Who's that girl, w-w-w-watch that girl
Well look at that girl
She lives down my street

I took her home to my place
Watching every move on her face
She said look what's your game
Are you trying to put me in shame
I said slow don't talk so fast
Don't you think that love can last
She said love Lord above
Now you're tryin' to trick me in love

All right now
Baby it's all right now

Baby, baby, baby it's all right
Baby, baby, baby it's all right

Took me home to her place
And I watched the smile on her face
When she moves me
I just watch that girl, watch that girl
And she said, "Love, you tryin' to trick me in love"
What's this now baby that's no good
Tryin' to trick me in love
Don't do that, no don't do that
Don't do that oh baby
All right now
Don't do, don't do that
You can't do that, can't do that
All right now baby
