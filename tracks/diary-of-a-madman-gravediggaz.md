​​​They killed my baby, oh God they killed my baby
Order in the court, order in the court
​​I will make you pay for this you murderers
I said order in the court now
Now, before this court passes judgement
Will the four defendants please rise and approach the bench
Trust me guys, it's all under control
The judge is my uncle, he'll take the insanity plea
Oh yeah, don't forget my retainer balance
Okay, I understand you guys are pleading insanity claiming
Demonic spirits possessed you to do these hideous murders
(Yeah, word)
Can you please explain to the court how these so called spirits made you into these raving madmen


Bear witness as I exercise my exorcism
The evil that lurks within the sin, the terrorism
Possessed by evil spirits, voices from the dead
I come forth with Gravediggaz in a head full of dread
I've been examined ever since I was semen
They took a sonogram and seen the image of a demon
At birth nurses surrounded me with needles
And drugged me all up with the diseases of evil
Grew up in Hell, now I dwell in an Islamic temple
I’m fighting a holy war in the mental
Look deep into my eyes you'll see visions of death
Possessed by homicide is what I am obsessed
Giving niggas brain dimples
Dragging their asses on my hook by their temples
The cause of death is unknown to the cops
Cause when I kill 'em, I’m not leaving one element to autops'
First I'll assassinate him, and them I'll cremate him
Then take all of his fucking ashes and evaporate him
I'll creep through the graveyard and hunt down your tombstone
Dig up your skeleton and stomp all your fucking bones
You try to haunt me nigga, I ain't tryna hear it
Buck buck buck, I'll give your ass a holy spirit


(Stressful, try to avoid all my impure thoughts, I am losing my mind
And it seems I don’t know what’s true or dream)
[Can you please explain to the court
When these problems first began?]


The year '84, November, day 10
Overwhelmed by the wicked inspirations of an evil djinn
I realize my ideas have spawned for 400 years
Of blood sweat and tears
I saw the torture, brutal murder of my father
So my brain became stained with the horror
I'm having reoccurring nightmares
Of being soaking wet, strapped down to the electric chair
I got tackled with handcuffs and shackled in restraint
At the bottom of a holy tabernacle
They gave me nothing to eat for two weeks
And sewed my eye lids open so I couldn't sleep
About to die from thirst, that's when the minister
Quenched my jaws with a cold glass of vinegar
Upon my wounds they seasoned me with salt
And nailed my hands feet to the form of a cross
Ah! I cry
As the blood drips inside of my eye refusing to die
Visions of Hell tormented my faith
So I chewed my fucking arm off and made an escape


(Your arm?! No way God dammit)
(Oh no, me mataron mi amigo, hijo de la gran puta
Esos cogines me mataron mi amigo que voy a cerca carajo, cono)
[Calm down people, please calm down
Let us please proceed with the defendants' explanation]


Enter the realms of understanding
And take good heed or you could bleed while I’m scanning
Three stages of pure Hell, 16 pages of red cells
*Shh* rain drops hits the pails
Path is dull and narrow, you're stalked by a shadow
I'll pierce your skull with the fucking arrow
So narrow, only one could enter at a time
Stuck in the center, read the signs
A thousand doors to choose, you better hurry
Don’t stop, shit is getting hot as a pot of curry
On your right side there’s fire, your left, deep waters
Watch your step, it's deep waters
What's that coming through the floor? It's a claw
*pssh* took his fucking ass to the fucking core
(ah!)


Stroll through the dark conditions
I stone you till I see sparks of friction
I chop ya like a coal miner
Then combine the drug and mix it with your blood
Some more, I give you some more and watch you crawl
Guts hit the floor, worms exit your pores
I trick ya, ha, then I'm quick to syringe
Deep into my thoughts and bust out your skin
You scream, portraits of inflictable pain, you can't stand
You're up to your hands in quicksand
You're sinking and sinking deep into the earth
Thoughts was possessed since the first day of birth
My mental says it's my turn to possess the matter
Stab you with a dagger up Jacob's ladder
Thoughts become shattered, confused and tragic
Fiery thoughts of Gravediggaz


Guilty, next case
