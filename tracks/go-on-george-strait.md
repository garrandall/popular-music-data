I'm so sorry, I keep interrupting, what were you gonna say?
You caught him cheatin', I don't blame you for walkin' away.
I know where you're comin' from, it sounds like where I've been
Oh, there I go interrupting your story once again

Go on, go on, you were sayin' how a fool can only fool you so long
It's true, it's so true when they do you like that
What else you can do but go on.

Our conversation won't change nothin', but it's sure nice to talk
With somebody who's been cut out of the same ol' cloth
You know how you said happiness can't be found lookin' back
If you don't mind, maybe we can talk a little more about that.

Go on, go on, you were sayin' this is better than sittin' at home
It's true, it's so true when they do you like that
What else can you do but go on...

Even when you see no reason to
Don't wait to live life 'cause it won't wait for you

Go on, please go on, you were sayin' what don't kill us only makes us strong
It's true, that's so true when they do you like that
What else can you do but go on.

Just go on.
Life goes on... and on.
