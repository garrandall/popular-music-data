Way back home
All alone
Just thinking about you
Wondering where you are
And what you did today
Did you ever think about
The love inside of me
Cause our loves a miracle
Just like a summer breeze
Late last night
When I was dreaming about you
I felt you by my side
Don't wanna live here without you
And oh, how I need you now

I can believe in miracles in the summertime
My tear drops fall in the pouring rain
And I don't wanna live without your love
I can believe in miracles in the summertime
And livin' here without you my sun don't shine
And I don't wanna live without you

I can believe in
Oh can u believe
I I I can I I
All alone
Live at home
I know its kinda hard to settle down
Just hold on
Won't be long
I'll be back to lay your burdens down
Come back and save me now
If you can find a way
If love is forever girl
Then let forever start today
Late last night
I was dreaming about you
The sparkle in your eyes
I can't stop thinking about you
To make you realize

I can believe in miracles in the summertime
My tear drops fall like the pouring rain
Cause everyday I'm living without your love
I can believe in miracles in the summertime
And livin' here without you my sun don't shine
And I don't wanna live without you

Everyday I sit alone
Waiting for your return
I still love you
And I still
Believe in miracles

I can believe in miracles in the summertime
I'm standing out stuck in the pouring rain
Cause every day without you my sun won't shine
I can believe in miracles in the summertime
(litto quevay que ai nasta kaywise)
Come back and save the love that you left behind

I can believe in miracles in the summertime
I'm living here without you my sun won't shine
Come back and say you love me and ill be fine
I can believe in miracles in the summertime

I can believe in miracles in the summertime
I can believe in miracles in the summertime
I can believe in miracles in the summertime
