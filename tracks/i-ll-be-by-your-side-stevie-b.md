When you look inside yourself
You will discover you'll learn to appreciate the only one
Who truly cares for you
Soon you'll see in life as you get older
You'll learn to understand I'm the only one
Who'll truly die for you

And you know when we go through these changes
Nothing can separate our love
When you feel that we are being strangers
Know this is coming from my heart

And I'll be by your side, baby
When you need shelter from the storm
When you need someone to keep you warm
'Cause I'll be by your side

I'll be by your side, baby
When you feel that no one cares for you
Let all my love come shining through
'Cause I'll be there for you

When I look back on the way we grew as lovers
Your tender touch
I love so much
It seems you've always been that way

My, oh, my
As friends, we grew as lovers
If you should ever doubt what I'm all about
These words I say to you

And you know when we go through these changes
Nothing can separate our love
When you feel that we are being strangers
Know this is coming from my heart

And I'll be by your side, baby
When you need shelter from the storm
When you need someone to keep you warm
'Cause I'll be by your side

And I'll be by your side, baby
When you feel that no one cares for you
Let all my love come shining through
'Cause I'll be there

When you feel that no one cares for you
And you need someone to pull you through
When you feel that life's too much to bear
I want you to know
I'll be there

And I'll be by your side, baby
When you need shelter from the storm
When you need someone to keep you warm
'Cause I'll be by your side

I'll be by your side, baby
When you feel that no one cares for you
Let all my love come shining through
'Cause I'll be there

I'll be by your side, baby
When you need shelter from the storm
When you need someone to keep you warm
'Cause I'll be by your side

I'll be by your side, baby
When you feel that no one cares for you
Let all my love come shining through
'Cause I'll be there for you

I'll be by your side
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
