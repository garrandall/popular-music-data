I know you
Don't know what I'm goin' through
Standing here
Looking at you

Well, let me tell you that it
(Hurt) Hurts so bad (Hurts so bad)
It makes me feel so sad (Hurts so bad)
It makes me hurt so bad
To see you again

Like needles and pins, people say
You've been making out okay
She's in love, don't stand in her way

But let me tell you that it
(Hurt) Hurts so bad (Hurts so bad)
It makes me feel so sad (Hurts so bad)
It's gonna hurt so bad
If you walk away

Why don't you stay and let me make it up to you
(Stay) I'll do anything you want me to
You loved me before
Please love me again
I can't let you go back to him

Please don't go, please don't go
Ohhhh, hurts so bad
Come back, it hurts so bad
Don't make it hurt so bad
I'm beggin' you please

Please don't go, please don't go
Ohhhh, hurts so bad
Come back, it hurts so bad
Don't make it hurt so bad
I'm beggin' you please

Please don't go, please don't go
Ohhhh, hurts so bad
Come back, it hurts so bad
