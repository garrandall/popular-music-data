I’m imagining a lot of happy people
And most of you are with someone you love
Well you are the lucky ones
All over the world there are
Lots of people who are alone tonight
I imagine most of us have been in that situation
At some time or another
I know I have
Recently I heard a most beautiful song, with a
Dynamic lyric that really expresses
This feeling of loneliness
It means a lot to me personally
And I’d like to share it with you
I think you’ll see what I mean


Take the ribbon from my hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Layin' soft against your skin
Like the shadows on the wall


Come and lay down by my side
'Til the early morning light
All I'm taking is your time
Help me make it through the night


I don't care what's right or wrong
And I won't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
For tonight I need a friend


Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's so sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night



Lord it's so sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night
Oh-oh
Lead me through the night
Oh-oh
Come on and take me through the night
Oh-oh
Through the night
