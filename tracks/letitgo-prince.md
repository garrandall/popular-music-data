Ready or not, here I come
(Come on)
(Come on)
All my life I've kept my feelings deep inside
Never was a reason 2 let somebody know
Lover here, lover there - Who cried? Who cared? Foolish pride
Never was a good seat at any of this man's shows

Until now all I wanted 2 do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

But now I've got 2 letitgo (letitgo)
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
I wanna just letitgo (letitgo)
Lay back and let my feelings show
(letitgo)
I'm ready 4 the real
Give me something I can feel

All my life this heart's been under lock and key
My curtains were drawn there wasn't nobody home
Trigger here, Trigger there - everybody's high except 4 me
Better off dead if I couldn't be alone

Until now all I wanted 2 do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

But now I've got 2 letitgo (letitgo)
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
I wanna just letitgo (letitgo)
Lay back and let my feelings show
I, I'm ready 4 the real
Give me something I can feel

4teen years and tears I've longed 2 sing my song
But a horse couldn't drag your ass 2 put me on
But now I've got an army and we're three million strong
This song will ring in your ears when we are gone

Until now all I wanted 2 do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

But now I want 2 letitgo (letitgo)
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
Said I want 2 letitgo (letitgo)
Lay back and let the feelings show

I am ready 4 the real (Come a little closer)

(letitgo)
(Lay back and let the vibe just flow)
