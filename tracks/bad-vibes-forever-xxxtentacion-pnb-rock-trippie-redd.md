Ohohoohgot you grindin' all on that
Ridin' all on that thing, make a young nigga eyes roll in my brain
What we gon' do? I can barely keep control
Catch the vibe of me, get the feel of me, vibe with me
Ohohoohgot you grindin' all on that
Ridin' all on that thing, make a young nigga eyes roll in my brain
What we gon' do? I can barely keep control
Catch the vibe of me, get the feel of me, vibe with me


I said, hey, put your pride right to the side (Yeah)
I can waste your time
Or I can change your life, I said now
Oh, shawty, where you goin'?
I just need one moment
So baby, keep your focus
I said stay, stay, babe
Stay, stay with me
Stay, stay, babe
Please don't run away
Please don't stray away


Ohohoohgot you grindin' all on that
Ridin' all on that thing, make a young nigga eyes roll in my brain
What we gon' do? I can barely keep control
Catch the vibe of me, get the feel of me, vibe with me
(Oh, yeah)


OhohoohI can barely keep control
When you're grindin' all on me
Ridin' all on me, girl, you take my soul, yeah (Yeah)
Ohohoohyou look like the girl of my dreams (Dreams)
My heart is on lock, need a key (Key)
It's right in your pocket', you see
All sex, no stress (Stress)
I ain't tryna hold you back (Back)
Ice on, who bought you that? (Ice)
Don't want you to go out sad
Girl, you know I'm fallin' for you (Yeah)
And girl, you know I'm all in' for you (Yeah)
And I'm in love with you, everything you do


Ohohoohgot you grindin' all on that
Ridin' all on that thing, make a young nigga eyes roll in my brain
What we gon' do? I can barely keep control
Catch the vibe of me, get the feel of me, vibe with me
