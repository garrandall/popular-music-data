Mama doesn't like when I sin so well
Heaven's kinda far
But I swear that when I'm coming it's close
Cuz we sin so well
Lead us not into temptation
Oh but what a way to go

My flesh has got control of me
I'm human and by nature weak
Cuz humans make it hard to be so holy
Angels close your eyes to this
My conscience can't compete with him
Yes I'm losing please forgive me

Mama doesn't like when I sin so well
Heaven's kinda far
But I swear that when I'm coming it's close
Cuz we sin so well
Lead us not into temptation
Oh but what a way to go

Heaven help this tendency
It's not the way I learned to be
But being bad is such a guilty pleasure
What shall be the consequence
When all they've taught I've gone against
And knowing all this still I go again

Mama doesn't like when I sin so well
Heaven's kinda far
But I swear that when I'm coming it's close
Cuz we sin so well
Lead us not into temptation
Oh but what a way to go

Where do I land if I fall from grace
Will I be redeemed if I seal my fate
I'll do my penance and rosary
But will you pray for my purity

Mama doesn't like when I sin so well
Heaven's kinda far
But I swear that when I'm coming it's close
Cuz we sin so well
Lead us not into temptation
Oh but what a way to go
