Shut up about politics
Ain't nothin' but a big pile of dirty tricks
I'm tired of all the fighting and the pitchin' fits
So shut up about politics

You punch left, I punch right
We're caught up in the middle of a deep swamp fight
Some people lie, and some people steal
But everybody's talking 'bout the Green New Deal

Shut up about politics
Ain't nothin' but a big pile of dirty tricks
I'm tired of all the fighting and the pitchin' fits
So shut up about politics

All this fussin' and carryin' on
It's been going on a little too long
But I got something to fix us all up
Take a shot of my whiskey from a big red cup

Shut up about politics
Ain't nothin' but a big pile of dirty tricks
I'm tired of all the fighting and the pitchin' fits
So shut up about politics

Shut up about politics
Ain't nothin' but a big pile of dirty tricks
I'm tired of all the fighting and the pitchin' fits
So shut up about politics

Shut up about politics
Ain't nothin' but a big pile of dirty tricks
I'm tired of all the fighting and the pitchin' fits
So shut up about politics

Shut up about politics
So shut up about politics
