Gonna sing it to ya time and time again...

Every man deserves a good woman
And I want you to be my wife

With a woman just like you in my life
So let me love ya
Fill you up inside I want to hold ya babe
So let me squeeze ya
Don'tcha know I'll get down on my knees for ya baby

Every time I wanna see ya
I can't find the words to tell ya so
But I love, I love, I love, I love, I love you babe
And I just got to let ya know
How much I need ya
Show you what you mean to me each day baby
So let me hold you
Keep ya safe and warm I'll be your sweetheart babe
Baby, baby, baby
And when I told ya
Girl, I'm an average guy
You seem to know just how I really feel
Cause I'm givin it all
I need you, I want you to stay right here with me
But baby, I never knew love...till you came along...


Casanova

I wanna make sweet love to you
I wanna be there when ya feel alone
Never letcha go, no
Casanova

And I want to love you, love you, love you, love you baby
Ohhh Casanova
