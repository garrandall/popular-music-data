How come you look so sad
You got me feeling bad
'Cause I know that I can make you happy
Don't want to see you blue
But you won't give me a chance

The guys that you hang around
Just try to bring you down
And I don't like it at all
Girl give my love a try 
I'll keep you satisfied I promise you

Girl I adore you I'll do anything for you
You oughta be with me
Girl I need you I'll try my best to please you
Can't you see you oughta be with me

When you come home at night
I'll make you feel so right
See this is what I'll do
I'll run your bubble bath

Massage you with these big strong hands
Wouldn't you like that Baby
Kiss you from head to toe
Because I want you so

I'm telling you the truth Baby
And after all of the above
We'll make real serious love
Can't you see you wanna be with me



Check this out nobody would do you like I
would do
I got a special kind of whip appeal
Kiss it rub it flip it over
Remember Baby I'm your Casanova

So forget the other brother he's nothing but
a zero
And dial my number let me be a hero
Girl Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder could tell
That you really oughta be with G.

You see you oughta be with me
The G.E.R. and the A.L.D.
The L.E.V.E.R. and the T.
You really oughta be with me
