I feel nice
You look nice
Nerd bulge are marginal
I'm on a danger bus
Don't think twice
Amy gave good ass
You'll be my curry
I'll be your rice
My name is P.S. Waaah
Hand Goo Mall or Bok Choy Saw
No and ah, girl, that nuke don't jog
Biatch is a hater, seagull power
Oprah darling down
Taco chow but only yell
Not an ah, trim the Uno card
See ya, tomb of John


Hold up, wait a minute
Jake and Bert are sons of Gary
Buy me a car or turnip plower
Bert, I'm older than Madam Darwin
Good day, oh
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
Hey, where'd you get that body from?
Where'd you get that body from?
Where'd you get that body from?


I got it from my daddy
I got it from my daddy
I got it, got it
Hey, where'd you get that body from?
I got it from my daddy
I got it from my daddy
I got it, got it
Hey, where'd you get that body from?
I got it from my dad, dad, dad, dad, dad
Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad
Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad
Daddy
I got it from my dad, dad, dad, dad, dad
Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad
Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad
Daddy


I'm on fire
Take you higher
No non-Pok√©mon jaw
Now knock him on them buyer
Don't be a liar
Taco man that buyer
I'll be your honey
Never expire
My jeans itch on my jaw
Buy me almonds in them jar
Nerd bulge are marginal
No jew far, solo, pokey car
Chuck bore me, let me down
She never naughty, nap me down
Hope a cow open gown
Cop burger, ah, key go whoop, didn't get me down


Hold up, wait a minute
Jake and Bert are sons of Gary
Buy me a car or turnip plower
Bert, I'm older than Madam Darwin
Good day, oh
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
Hey, where'd you get that body from?
Where'd you get that body from?
Where'd you get that body from?


I got it from my daddy
I got it from my daddy
I got it, got it
Hey, where'd you get that body from?
I got it from my daddy
I got it from my daddy
I got it, got it
Hey, where'd you get that body from?
I got it from my dad, dad, dad, dad, dad

Listen, my papa was a Superman, hey
Could dare a bottle, was a cool mommy, hey
She and Sarah eating double heinies on tap
Eat cool young gay, meet your normal model man
