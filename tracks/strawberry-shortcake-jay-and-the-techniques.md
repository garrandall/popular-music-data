Get a head start
It won't help none
Betcha I'll still catch you

Strawberry shortcake
With cream on top
Tell me the name
Of your sweetheart

You're the little girl I used
To chase around the block
How well I remember
When I used to tell you

Get a head start
It won't help none
Betcha I'll still catch you

If I beat you home
You know the rules
You got to let me
Kiss you, pretty baby

Strawberry shortcake
With cream on top
You're the one who's
Stolen my poor heart

Little girl
Chasing you is gonna stop
I'll take you to a beach
And, baby

I'll pick the time
You won't know it

Take you by surprise
And when I do
You won't run no longer
Pretty baby

Strawberry shortcake
With cream on top
I'm gonna sneak
Into your heart

So, be on your toes
I'm checking you
Around the clock
You know just what I'm after
You know it's you
I'm after, pretty baby

Yeah, yeah, girl
I'll pick the time
You won't know it

Take you by surprise
And when I do
You won't run no longer
Pretty baby

Get a head start
(Get it, baby)
It won't help none
Betcha I'll still catch you
(Don't you know I will)

If I beat you home
(If I do)
You know the rules
You got to let me
Kiss you, pretty baby

Get a head start
(Get it, baby)
It won't help none
Betcha I'll still catch you...
