Trailer for sale or rent
Rooms to let, fifty cents
No phone, no pool, no pets
I ain't got no cigarettes

Ah but two hours of pushing broom
Buys a eight by twelve four-bit room
I'm a man of means, by no means
King of the road

Third boxcar, midnight train
Destination: Bangor, Maine
Old worn out suit and shoes
I don't pay no union dues

I smoke, old stogies I have found
Short, but not too big around
I'm a man of means, by no means
King of the road

I know every engineer on every train
All of the children and all of their names
Every handout in every town
Every lock that ain't locked when no one's around

I sing, trailers for sale or rent
Rooms to let, fifty cents
No phone, no pool, no pets
I ain't got no cigarettes

Ah but, two hours of pushing broom
Buys an eight by twelve four-bit room
I'm a man of means, by no means
King of the road

Trailer for sale or rent
Rooms to let, fifty cents
No phone, no pool, no pets
I ain't got no cigarettes

Ah but, two hours of pushing broom
Buys an eight by twelve four-bit room
