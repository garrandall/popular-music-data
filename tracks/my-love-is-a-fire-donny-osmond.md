Oh-oh Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh

BASS!

It's quarter to two,
And I've still got you on my mind, oh baby.
I'm just a prisoner,
Trapped in the chains of your love.
It cuts like a knife, imagining life without you,
Oh darling.
I'm up to the challenge, and I'm willing to fight.
I'd do anything to have you with me tonight...
Oh baby...

I'd swim a river if the river was wide,
I'd climb a mountain if the mountain was high.
I'd do anything, girl, just to be by your side.
I'm out of my mind, my love is a fire.

It's heaven on earth, and we don't need words
To describe it.
I'm lost in forever,
I don't ever wanna come down.
I was a fool, I broke every rule before you, girl.
Searching for answers and I've looked high and low.
Now that I've found you, girl, I can't let you go.
Oh baby...

Id swim a river if the river was wide,
Id climb a mountain if the mountain was high
Id do anything, girl, just to be by your side.
Im out of my mind, my love is a fire.

Oh-oh Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh

I'm burning up,
Can't cool down.
Flames getting higher,
Burning down to the ground.

I'd swim a river if the river was wide,
I'd climb a mountain if the mountain was high.
I'd do anything, girl, just to be by your side.
I'm out of my mind, my love is a fire.

I'd swim a river if the river was wide,
I'd climb a mountain if the mountain was high.
I'd do anything, girl, just to be by your side.
I'm out of my mind, my love is a fire.

I'd swim a river if the river was wide,
I'd climb a mountain if the mountain was high.
I'd do anything, girl, just to be by your side.
I'm out of my mind, my love is a fire.

Oh-oh Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh
