When my body's feenin' for you, baby
Gotta call you up and let you know
It's what I'm feelin', baby

Nine one one zero zero twenty-four
Baby, it's an emergency

Would you like it if I was to sex you down

I can't think about nothing else
You sentulate me with your love

Oh, it's your body babe
All over my body, girl

Wanna fill you up till your river flows all over me
Wanna feel your precious treasure
Wrapped around me, oh, so tightly
In, out, I wanna hear you shout

Won't you come on, baby, let me break you off
I guarantee I'll turn you out
How would you like if I lay you down
Would you like it if I was to sex you down

Baby, girl stop fighting you know
You want me just like I want you
Never had a lover that would do
The things that Johnny can do

My body all over your body, babe
