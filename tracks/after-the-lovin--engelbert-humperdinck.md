So I sing you to sleep 
After the lovin'
With a song I just wrote yesterday
And I hope you can hear
What the words and the music have to say

It's so hard to explain 
Everything that I'm feelin'
Face to face, I just seem to go dry
But I love you so much
That the sound of your voice can get me high

Thanks for taking me (thanks for taking me)
On a one way trip to the sun (one way trip to the sun)
And thanks for turning me (turning me)
Into a someone (someone)

So I sing you to sleep
After the lovin'
I brush back the hair from your eyes
And the love on your face
Is so real that it makes me want to cry

And I know that my song isn't saying anything new
Oh, but after the lovin'
I'm still in love with you

So I sing you to sleep 
After the lovin'
I brush back the hair from your eyes (after the lovin')
And the love on your face
Is so real that it makes me want to cry (your love is real, it makes me cry)

And I know that my song isn't saying anything new
Oh, but after the lovin' (after the lovin')
I'm still in love with you
Yes, after the lovin' (after the lovin')
I'm still in love with you
Hmm, after the lovin'
I'm still in love with you
