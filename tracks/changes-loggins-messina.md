You are a young man and you're eager to seek
A way to let the world know what you think
The lesson learned is not taught in a school
You have to start out first by being a fool

But I seen changes, they happen every day
And I see change coming your way

You give your life away
For what in return
One chance to see your name in lights
While you learn

Your manager is home
And working a way
To keep you on the road
And moving day to day

But I seen changes, they happen every day
And I see change coming your way

You work yourself to death
So you can have a home
You put your money aside
To call it all your own

You finally save enough
And you think you're gonna advance
Turn around, there's Uncle Sam
He's got his hand down your pants

And I seen changes, they happen every day
And I see change coming your way

Maybe some change is all that we need
Change is coming to help us succeed
Change happens every day
Change happens every day
Change happens every day
