I sometimes wonder why all the flowers have to die
I dream about you and now summer's come and gone
And the nights they seem so long
Come on over tonight, come on over

It's gonna be a cool night
Just let me hold you by the firelight
If it don't feel right, you can go
Oh, when the cool night
Brings back memories of a good life
When this love was not so old

I won't talk about the past
How love's supposed to last forever
And you, don't have to take a stand, lay out any plans
Come on over tonight, come on over

It's gonna be a cool night
Just let me hold you by the firelight
If it don't feel right, you can go
Oh, when the cool night
Brings back memories of a good life
When this love was not so old

Come on over tonight, come on over
It's gonna be a cool night
Just let me hold you by the firelight
If it don't feel right you can go

On a cool night, let me hold you
On a cool, just let me hold you by the firelight
If it don't feel right you can go
