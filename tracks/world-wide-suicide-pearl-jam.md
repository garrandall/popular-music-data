I felt the earth on Monday. It moved beneath my feet. 
In the form of a morning paper. Laid out for me to see. 

Saw his face in a corner picture. I recognized the name. 
Could not stop staring at the. Face I'd never see again. 

It's a shame to awake in a world of pain 
What does it mean when a war has taken over 

It's the same everyday in a hell manmade 
What can be saved, and who will be left to hold her? 

The whole world...World over. 
It's a worldwide suicide. 

Medals on a wooden mantle. Next to a handsome face. 
That the president took for granted. 
Writing checks that others pay. 

And in all the madness. Thought becomes numb and naive. 
So much to talk about. Nothing for to say. 

It's the same everyday and the wave won't break 
Tell you to pray, while the devils on their shoulder 

Laying claim to the take that our soldiers save 
Does not equate, and the truth's already out there 

The whole world,... World over. 
It's a worldwide suicide. 

The whole world,... World over. 
It's a worldwide suicide. 

Looking in the eyes of the fallen 
You got to know there's another, another, another, another 
Another way 

It's a shame to awake in a world of pain 
What does it mean when a war has taken over 

It's the same everyday and the wave won't break 
Tell you to pray, while the devils on their shoulder 

The whole world,... World over. 
It's a worldwide suicide. 

The whole world,... World over. 
It's a worldwide suicide.
