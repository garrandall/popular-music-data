As an only child of seventeen
It hurt when my momma died
When my daddy got home
Just a few days later
Well, he broke right down and cried

But after a year
He up and wed
A girl that was half his age
Then the family was my daddy
And me and Judy Mae

Well, my daddy did a lot of traveling around
And before he would say goodbye
He'd tell me to take care of my new mama
She's the apple of his eye

And as he kissed his brand new wife goodbye
I always used to hear him say
Look after my boy
Won't you please, now, Judy Mae

Judy Mae
Oh, she sure had a way of looking after me
Yes, her eyes would sparkle and shine
Every time Papa got ready to leave

Well, one night while my daddy was gone
She tiptoed into my room
She said that she had to talk to me
Cause my dad was gonna be home soon

She said, you know
I get so lonely and cold
When your daddy is gone for days
What a boy like you could do to Judy Mae

Well, I told her that I'd never done this before
And then she took my hand
And showed me all of the secret things
That turned a boy into a man

And as I lay there by her side
I heard a noise at the window pane
I think that's just the wind
Said Judy Mae

Judy Mae
Oh, she sure had a way of looking after me
Yes, her eyes would sparkle and shine
Every time Papa got ready to leave

Well, the next day
Daddy had an accident
And two days later, he died
The sheriff said my Daddy
Could drive too good to even
Try to take a turn that wide

But thinking back now
I begin to wonder
To this very day
If it was him, not the wind
That saw me with Judy Mae
If it was him, not the wind
That saw me with Judy Mae
