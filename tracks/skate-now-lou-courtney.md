They're doing it in the street
Doing it with folks they meet
They're doing it in the hall
They're doing it up on the wall

They're doing it in the air now
They're doing it everywhere

Come on, skate now, children
Come on, skate now, children
Come on, skate now, children
Do the skate now, children

I say the mamas and the papas are doing it
Sisters and brothers are doing it
The kids in the block now, now, now
Are doing it around the clock

Hey, the hippies from the city, y'all
Getting down to the nitty gritty

Come on, skate now, children
I said, skate now, children
Come on, skate now, hey, children
Do the skate now, hey, children

I said oooh...
There ain't nothing, nothing to it
You can do it

If you got soul, yeah
Said if you got soul now
I said you got the beat now
Children, get up, get up
Move your feet now

Come on, baby
I said skate now
Now, now, children
Come on, skate now
Now, now, children
Come on, skate now
Now, now, children
Come on, skate now
Now, now, children

Get to the groove
Get lost, get lost and move
All right, said
Move your feet now
Now, now, baby...
