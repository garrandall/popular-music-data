You remind me of something
I just can't think of what it is

 - You remind me of my jeep, I wanna ride it
Something like my sound, I wanna pump it
Girl you look just like my cars, I wanna wax it
And something like my bank account
I wanna spend it, baby

It's something about your love that's got me going crazy
Baby, you know I want you real bad
And girl I really like your freaky style
How can I be down with you?
So get a little closer to my ride
I wanna get to know you lady
And hip me up on how to get inside you
Listen, pretty baby

 - I wanna roll it, roll it, roll it, roll it
Is all I wanna do for you baby
Girl, it's something kind of sexy
Goin' on about you babe


Now I would like to take you on a ride tonight
Girl, you know we'll have so much fun
And give you everything your body needs
Satisfaction guaranteed
So pull up to my bumper and let the system sound
Girl, I bet cha' I can drive you crazy
And let me be the one to drop you off
Babe, listen to me


Don't be alone, don't be alone
I'm comin' through your door
Turn off the lights, turn off the lights, baby
It's something about this moment
