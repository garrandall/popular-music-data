Out of sight out of mind
So the story goes
You forgot I exist
My broken heart knows

Out of sight out of mind
You found someone new
But I can't change my love
The way that you do

I sit around a wondering
About your new affair
I should forget to remember
And remember not to care

I'd forget if I could
But my heart is so blind
You are gone out of sight
But not out of my mind

You are gone out of sight
But not out of my mind
