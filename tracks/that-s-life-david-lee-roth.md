When that evenin'
Sun go down
You won't find me
Hangin' 'round

'Cause I know the night life
Ain't no good life
Yeah, but it's my life

Listen, all the people
Just like you and me
They all just dreamin'
'Bout some old used to be

They know the night life
Ain't no good life
Yeah, but it's my life

Wait a minute
What's that I think I hear, I say

Baby, listen to the blues
And hear what they say
I said, listen to the blues, baby
Hear the guitar play

Don't tell me life
Life is just an empty thing
Nothing but people
A whole boulevard of broken dreams

I know the night life
Ain't no good life
Yeah, but it's my life
Woah

Give it soul, yeah

I know the night life
Ain't no good life
Oh, baby
Oh, it's my life

Yeah, I know the night life
It's my life, yeah
