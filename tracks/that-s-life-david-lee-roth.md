That's life (that's life)
That's what all the people say
You're riding high on Monday
Shot down in May
But-a, I ain't never gonna change my tune
When I'm back on top in the month of June

I said, that's life (that's life)
Ain't as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks
Stompin' on a dream
But-a, I don't never let it get me down
'cause that big ol' world keeps spinnin' 'round

Been a puppet, pirate, a poet, a pauper, a pawn and a king
Been up and down and over and out and I know one thing
Each time that I find myself flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race

That's life (that's life)
And I can't deny it
Many times I thought of quitting, babe
But my heart wouldn't buy it
If I didn't think it was worth one try
I'd jump right on a big bird and I'd fly

Been a puppet, poet, pirate, pauper, now I'm a king
Been up, down, I know one thing
Each time that I find myself flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race

That's life (that's life)
And I can't deny it
Many times I thought of quitting, babe
But my heart wouldn't buy it
If I didn't think it was worth one try
I'd just roll myself up in a big ball and fly

Zop-pop-dup-shoo-be-doo-be-doo
