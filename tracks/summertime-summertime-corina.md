Take me away, llevame contigo
I wanna play, querio jugar a la playa, en la tierra
La brisa que el mar trae
Querio estar contigo in the summertime (summertime)

Summertime, summertime... take me away
We can fall in love (summertime)

I'm looking at the rain outside
Please come and take me for a ride
I really want you
To come and take me far away (I want to say)

Take me, take me to the water,
Summertime, summertime
Maybe, we can fall in love,
Summertime, summertime

Summertime...
Summertime...
Summertime...
Summertime...

I'm dreaming, lying on the sand
You come to me and take my hand
I can't believe it's true
But you called me out today, 

Take me, take me to the water,
Summertime, summertime
Maybe, we can fall in love,
Summertime, summertime

Take me, take me to the water,
Summertime, summertime
Maybe, we can fall in love,
Summertime, summertime

Take me, take me to the water,
Summertime, summertime
Maybe, we can fall in love,
Summertime, summertime

Take me, take me to the water,
Summertime, summertime
Maybe, we can fall in love,
Summertime, summertime

We can fall in love, summertime, summertime
