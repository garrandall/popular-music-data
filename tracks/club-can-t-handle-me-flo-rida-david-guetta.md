You know I know how
To make 'em stop and stare as I zone out
The club can't even handle me right now
Watchin' you watchin' me, I go all out
The club can't even handle me right now
(Eh, yea-ei-yeah, eh, yea-ei-yeah, eh, yea-yeah)
The club can't even handle me right now
(Eh, yea-ei-yeah, eh, yea-ei-yeah, eh, yea-yeah)
Haha! Can't nothin' handle me right now!
I see you, D. Guetta, let's get 'em!


Hey
I own the night and I don't need no help
Gotta be the feeling that Scarface felt
Stuntin' gone wild, can't handle this playa
Life of the club arrogant like, yeah
Talk like money, all the girls just melt
One too many, all on me like twelve
Look like cash and they all just stare
Bottles, models, standin' on chairs
Ball out 'cause that's the business
All out, it's so ridiculous
Zone out, so much attention
Scream out, I'm in the building - hey!
They watchin', I know this
I'm rockin', I'm rollin'
I'm holdin', I know it, you know it


You know I know how
To make 'em stop and stare as I zone out
The club can't even handle me right now
Watchin' you watchin' me, I go all out
The club can't even handle me right now
(Eh, yea-ei-yeah, eh, yea-ei-yeah, eh, yea-yeah)
The club can't even handle me right now
(Eh, yea-ei-yeah, eh, yea-ei-yeah, eh, yea-yeah)


Hey
Still feelin' myself, I'm like outta control
Can't stop now, more shots, let's go
Ten more rounds, can I get a K.O.?
Paparazzi tryna make me pose
Came to party 'til I can't no more
Celebrate 'cause that's all I know
Tip the groupies takin' off they clothes
Grand finale like Super Bowl
Go hard, I run the show
That's right, wild out, got money to blow
More lights, more ice, when I walk in the door
No hype, do it big all over the globe
Yeah! I said it, go tell it
Confetti, who ready?
I'm ready! You ready? Let's get it!


You know I know how
To make 'em stop and stare as I zone out
The club can't even handle me right now
Watchin' you watchin' me, I go all out
The club can't even handle me right now
(Eh, yea-ei-yeah, eh, yea-ei-yeah, eh, yea-yeah)
(Put your hands up!)
(Put your hands up!)
(Put your hands up!)
The club can't even handle me right now
(Eh, yea-ei-yeah, eh, yea-ei-yeah, eh, yea-yeah)
(Put your hands up!)
(Put your hands up!)
(Put your hands up!)


You got me watchin' now (yeah)
Got my attention now (yeah)
Got everybody in the club wantin' to know now
I am a ladies' man, come and be my lady and
We can ball, so, ah!
Bring ya body here, let me switch up ya atmosphere
Take you out of the club and up in my new Lear (yeah)
Fly you all around the world
Whatchu want, baby girl?
Are you ready to go, now?


You know I know how
To make 'em stop and stare as I zone out
The club can't even handle me right now
Watchin' you watchin' me, I go all out
The club can't even handle me right now
(Eh, yea-ei-yeah, eh, yea-ei-yeah, eh, yea-yeah)
(Put your hands up!)
(Put your hands up!)
