Oh yeah
Work

Somebody told me
"Boy, everything she wants is everything she sees"
I guess I must have loved you
'Cause I said you were the perfect girl for me, baby

But now we're six months older
And everything you want and everything you see
Is out of reach, not good enough
I don't know what the hell you want from me but boy

Somebody tell me, won't you tell me
Why I work so hard for you?
Give you money
All to give you money

Some people work for a living
Some people work for fun, girl, I just work for you
They told me marriage was a give and take
Well, show me you can take you've got some giving to do

And now you tell me that you're having my baby
I'll tell you that I'm happy if you want me to
But one step further and my back will break
If my best isn't good enough
Than how can it be good enough for two?
I can't work any harder than I do

Somebody tell me, won't you tell me?
Why I work so hard for you?
Give you money
All to give you money

Why do I do the things I do? I'd tell you if I knew
My God, I don't even think that I love you

Won't you tell me?
Give you money
All to give you money

Somebody tell me, won't you tell me?
Why I work so hard for you?
Give you money
All to give you money

Somebody tell me, won't you tell me?
Why I work so hard for you?
Give you money
All to give you money

Somebody tell me, won't you tell me?
Why I do the things that I do?
Give you money
All to give you money
