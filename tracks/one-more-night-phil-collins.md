One more night
One more night
One more night

I've been trying oh so long
To let you know
Let you know how I feel, mm
If I stumble, if I fall
Just help me back
So I can make you see
Please give me

One more night
Give me just one more night
Oh, one more night
'Cause I can't wait forever
One more night
One more night
Oh, one more night
'Cause I can't wait forever

I've been sitting here so long, wasting time
Just staring at the phone
And I was wondering should I call you
Then I thought
Maybe you're not alone
Give me

One more night
Give me just one more night
Oh, one more night
'Cause I can't wait forever
One more night
One more night
Oh, one more night
'Cause I can't wait forever
One more night
Give me just one more night
Oh, one more night
'Cause I can't wait forever

Like a river to the sea
I will always be with you
And if you should sail away
I will follow you, you (yeah)

I know there'll never be a time
When we feel the same
And I know it's only words
But if, if you change your mind
You know that I'll be here
And maybe, maybe we both can learn
Oh, give me, just give me one

One more night
Give me just one more night
Oh, one more night
'Cause I can't wait forever
One more night
One more night
Oh, one more night
'Cause I can't wait forever
...
