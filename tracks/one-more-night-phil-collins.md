One more night, one more night
One more night
I've been trying ooh so long to let you know
Let you know how I feel
And if I stumble, if I fall, just help me back
So I can make you see


Please give me one more night, give me one more night
One more night 'cause I can't wait forever
Give me just one more night, uh, just one more night
Oh, one more night 'cause I can't wait forever


I've been sitting here so long
Wasting time, just staring at the phone
And I was wondering should I call you
Then I thought maybe you're not alone


Please give me one more night, give me just one more night
Oh, one more night, 'cause I can't wait forever
Please give me one more night, uh^, just one more night
Oh, one more night, 'cause I can't wait forever
Give me one more night, give me just one more night
Ooh, one more night, 'cause I can't wait forever


Like a river to the sea
I will always be with you
And if you sail away
I will follow you


Give me one more night, give me just one more night
Oh, one more night, 'cause I can't wait forever


I know there'll never be a time you'll ever feel the same
And I know it's only words
But if you change your mind, you know that I'll be here
And maybe we both can learn


Give me just one more night, give me just one more night
Ooh, one more night, 'cause I can't wait forever
Give me just one more night, give me just one more night
Ooh one more night, 'cause I can't wait forever
