Push, push, push, push, push
Push, push, push, push, push


Push, push
You got to give a lover some
Push, push
You know what I'm talking of
Push, push, come on and
Baby, don't be a fool
You gotta push
Yada yada yada ya

Hey, pretty baby
Don't be so shy
Come on and show me
That I'm your guy

Hold my hand
We're gonna take a walk
Don't be bashful
Talk that talk



See that little robin
Sitting on that branch
Push that other robin
Into sweet romance

Look at that hummingbird
Kiss that bee
Don't be bashful
Come and kiss me



Ooh, look at that moon
Hugging that old sky
Look at the star
Winking it's eye

Come on, baby, can't you see
That old star's telling
You and me to



Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Push, push, push...
