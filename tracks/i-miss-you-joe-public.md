Is this what itâs about baby?
(ohh)
Fuck in the champagne lets 
Toast to the cocaine
Put me in the g4 plane
Now we in g5 to go with these eyes
Rolling a 1000 niggers deep
You use to love it
Now itâs about just you and me
Bitch you bluffing
I ain't playing
Iâm just saying
Let a nigger live
I was fucking them hoes
I put you where I live

(Oooo)
You had the keys to the panorama
Always tryna blame me
You need to blame the mirror
I blame myself for fucking with you girl but
Couldnât help but love the way the Spanish fit you girl
All that ass, slim waist
Nice walk, cute face, sick taste 
Bell Harvard gone miss you boo
And the condo security guards they gonna miss you too


Letâs take a trip, letâs take a trip, letâs take a trip arooooound the world 
Oooh 


Got killers on the private
No need for public defenders 
When you get the kind of Gâs that I get
Watch the sunset from up above
I swear to God I seen a trials fall from up above
Letâs take a trip somewhere special where thereâs water
Then weâll take a dip 
You can order you some diamonds with a side of grits
Sip mimosa; get fucked to sounds of Vandross, Luther
You know listening might lose ya
Donât diss him, he might shoot ya
Paradise is just step away 
Look in my eyes I take your breath away


Letâs take a trip, letâs take a trip, letâs take a trip arooooound the world
Ohhhh 

You donât have to run no further baby
âCause Iâma keeps on doing my thing,
Yeaaaa
Ohhhhhhh

Ooooooooo
Lets take a trip, lets take a trip, lets take a trip arooooound the world
Ohhh 

All around the world we go
London & Tokyo
Where ever this long journey takes us weâll gooo
If you donât, then I donât care
âCause Iâm gone fuck
Every bitch around the world
