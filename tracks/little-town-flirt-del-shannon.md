Here she comes, that little town flirt
You're falling for her and your gonna get hurt
Yeah, I know it's so hard to resist
The temptation of her tender red lips
But you can get hurt, hur-hur-hurt
Yeah, you can get hur-hur-hur-hur-hurt
Foolin' around with that little town flirt

Here she comes with that look in her eye
She plays around with every guy that goes by
Yeah, I know she's gonna treat you wrong
So your heart just better be strong
'Cause you can get hurt, hur-hur-hurt
Yeah, you can get hur-hur-hur-hur-hurt
Foolin' around with that little town flirt

I know how you feel, you think her love is real
You think this time she'll be sincere
But you'll think you've got a paper heart
When she starts to tear it apart
That's when she'll let you go
Whoa whoa whoa

Here she comes, just look at that style
She's looking at you, giving you that smile
But I know she's gonna treat you wrong
So your heart just better be strong
'Cause you can get hurt, hur-hur-hurt
Yeah, you can get hur-hur-hur-hur-hurt
Foolin' around with that little town flirt

You better run and hide now, boy
You better pass her by now, yeah boy
You better run away now, yeah
