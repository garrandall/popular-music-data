My bitch drive a all white Range
Couldn't hit it if you nigga's had aim
Lames can't call and you a lame
You had it then you lost it, hall of shame
I can buy a Bentley, don't talk to me
For a show 150, don't talk to me
You ain't never helped your mans, don't talk to me
You just follow all the trends, don't talk to me
I set the bar, I'm the fuckin' bar
In the sky, I'm a fuckin' star
I don't fall in love 'cause I be lovin' hard
Do everything like my shirt, extra large
I don't care how I crash a Ghost
Got two cribs in two states I be through the most
I got white folks money that I won't blow
If you ask why 'cause the white folks don't

Big bank take lil' bank, bank
Big bank take lil' bank, bank
Type of money you gon' need a safe
Type of money you gon' need a bank
From the hood, it's type of money make you stay awake
Type of money she gon' let you put it in her face
Big bank take lil' bank, bank
Big bank take lil' bank, bank


Everything proper, no propaganda
Choppa count a Goyard bandana
Big sack, a lotta hoes like Santa
Threw a birthday party in a Phantom
Big shit like a dinosaur did it
And you know Tity shinin' like acrylic
Yeah I sold dope, I had cornrows
I can you see niggas hang with the door close
Now I'm lookin' for a glove with the sparkle on it
And my CBD got chocolate on it
Big bank take small ass shit
Bank account on some tall ass shit
Attitude on some fuck you too
Bankroll on what it do, boo?
Meet me at the room at Vibe, and if I ain't did it yet, I'll try


Big bank take lil' bank, bank
Big bank take lil' bank, bank
Type of money you gon' need a safe
Type of money you gon' need a bank
From the hood, it's type of money make you stay awake
Type of money she gon' let you put it in her face
Big bank take lil' bank, bank
Big bank take lil' bank, bank


She said whatchu' gon do if I leave?
I said bitch, I'ma do me
B.I.G., bitch everything zoomed in
Big bag on me lookin' like I'm movin' in
Got my foot in the door and we still here
I'm a first generation millionaire
I broke the curse in my family not having shit
I'm passionate, like girls that's after more than just cash and dick
Feed me to the wolves now I lead the pack and shit
You boys all cap, I'm more Colin Kaepernick
I'm rare as affordable health care or going to wealth from welfare
I turn my Ws to M's, yeah I flip those
I might buy her red bottoms with the crypto
3 coins, that'll pay ya whole semester
But you gotta ride it better than a Tesla


Big bank take lil' bank, bank (lil' bitch)
Big bank take lil' bank, bank
Type of money you gon' need a safe
Type of money you gon' need a bank
From the hood, it's type of money make you stay awake
Type of money she gon' let you put it in her face
Big bank take lil' bank, bank
Big bank take lil' bank, bank


Uh oh
Back again
Back to back Maybach, stack the M's
Told em' I met Slim Shady, bag the M
Once he go black, he'll be back again
Tell them hoes that it's crunch time, abdomen
Yes I cop mad Chanel and mad Given'
She did it again, imagine them
Bout to make these bum bitches mad again
Uh oh
Back to them, I lead the pack so my backs to them
Yep, the queens back, what's happenin'?
Rerun bout to make these bitches rap again
Diamond chains on my ankle
Young Money in the cut like a shank though
Tell T.I.P. rubber band's in my bankroll
Show my ass like a stank hoe


Big bank take lil' bank
Big bank take lil' bank
Type of money you gon' need a safe
Type of money you gon' need a bank
From the hood, it's type of money make you stay awake
Type of money she gon' let you put it in her face
Big bank take lil' bank, bank
Big bank take lil' bank, bank
