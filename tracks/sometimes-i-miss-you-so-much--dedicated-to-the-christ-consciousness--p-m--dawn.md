There are only whispers and shadows for me
The way things are and the way things are
And with this I blow a kiss to disaster
Because I wish to perfect my heart...
I gotta check my mind...
Am I in tune with you?
Do we connect within the realm of the gods?
Electric word "life" that means forever
and that's a mighty long time when you've kissed divine
So divine...as with you
The Christ within will come in the clouds
Trusting "divinity is always with me"
Trusting "this is the here and now"
Mercy's right...I gotta check my love
and I'm trying to do as such
I don't let the demons get me down
it's just that sometimes I miss you so much...

I can envision all things to life
I can understand realistic ways
But I invent the next phase in forever
I like you, rewrite the next page
It's so pristine...it's so untouched
I'm an emmaculate sign of devotion
Still unseen...I'm thinking so what
Bless me cursed with colorful emotions
God said "I guess you don't know I'm you
because you know the entire 360"
A Christ that's me
A Christ that's you
Regardless...constantly within me
I'm so not responsible for this
I'm just a man in love with so much
I know love...you'll always be with me
It's just sometimes I miss you so much
