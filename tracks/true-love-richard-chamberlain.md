I give to you and you give to me
True love, true love
So on and on, it will always be
True love, true love

For you and I have
A guardian angel on high
With nothing to do

But to give to you
And to give to me
Love, forever true

(For you and I have
A guardian angel on high
With nothing to do)

But to give to you
And to give to me
Love, forever true
Love, forever true
