Oh, hold me tight
Won't you be my woman tonight?
Oh, hold me tight
Won't you be my woman tonight?

I get the shivers up and down my spine
The only time I'm happy's when I know she's mine
So hold, hold me tight

Treat me right
Won't you be my woman tonight?
So treat me right
Won't you be my woman tonight?

First I see you
And then you let me go
The only time I touch you's when you don't wanna know
So hold, hold me tight, all right

Hold me tight
Hold me tight
Won't you be my woman tonight
Hold me tight
Won't you be my woman tonight

I get the shivers up and down my spine
The only time I'm happy's when I know she's mine
So, hold, hold me tight
Hold me tight, woman tonight
