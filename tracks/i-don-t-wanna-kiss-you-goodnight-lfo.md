Ohhhh...
I can't believe the night is gone
And now it's time to take you home
Girl as you come in close to give me one last kiss
You're making it hard to be so near ya
Don't wanna leave you like this no, Cause...
Chorus
I don't wanna kiss you goodnight
If a kiss means this night is over
I don't wanna have to say goodbye
No no no
Girl don't leave me standing at your door
When this night could lead to so much more
I wanna hold you (hold you)
I wanna touch you (touch you)
So when I kiss you
Don't wanna kiss you good night
I used to see you in my dreams (hoping one day they'd come true)
And then you gave yourself to me
But now we're standing here
And I'm holding you
And it's never felt so right
Don't wanna leave it here
Wanna come inside
And kiss you where you like
Chorus
I don't wanna kiss you goodnight
If a kiss means this night is over
I don't wanna have to say goodbye
No no no
Girl don't leave me standing at your door
When this night could lead to so much more
I wanna hold you (hold you)
I wanna touch you (touch you)
So when I kiss you
Don't wanna kiss you good night
I wish this night could be endless
Baby feeling your skin on my skin
I take my time to make you breathless
Girl we can do it again and again
