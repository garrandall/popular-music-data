Can't think of any reason
Don't know exactly why
Must be it's out of season
Give it another try

I'm out here in the meadow
Part of an old stone wall
Stand here because he said so
Waitin' around to fall

Some things are left unspoken
Some things are handme down
The circle stands unbroken
Sendin' it back around

I've seen you roll in clover
Dressed for a scarecrow wall
Too bad the dance is over
Nothin' to show at all

Can't help but feel uncertain
Knowing which way to turn
They want to raise the curtain
And you're holdin' the words to learn

I'm out here in the meadow
Part of an old stone wall
Stand here because he said so
Waitin' around to fall
