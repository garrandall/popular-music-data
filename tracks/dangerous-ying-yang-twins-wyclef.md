Lets Go
I like the
the way she dance
she take the thug
put them in the trance
She shake her ass
like an avalanche
Look into her eyes
And you taking the chance
I see the fire in her eyes
Fire in her eyes
The way she moves
She got the fire in her eyes
Fire on her waist
Fire in her thighs
I love the scandal
She so dangerous (dangerous)
She's so dangerous (dangerous)
She's so scandolous (scandolous)
I love the scandal
Hear me sing

Wohoo Hear she comes
Watch out boy she'll chew you up
She's dangerous (dangerous)
Dangerous (dangerous)
I love the scandal

She's fine She's fine
She heals She mine
Black barbie
I'm ken
She got hundred men and boosting?
I ain't really trying to let you in
But you can spend your Benjamins
Make no mistake thanking she your friend
disses all about divedens

Wait she like to play games
And she don't care who she play wit'
She do what she do
And she gon' get what she gon' get
She hit the strip club
And she gon' make her money quick
Shaking ass
On the pole
And bets ta believe lil momma thick

I like the way
the way she dance
She take the thug
Put 'em in her trance
She shake her ass
Like an avalanche
Lookin to her eyes
And you takin' a chance
I see the fire in her eyes
Fire in here eyes
The way she moves
She got the fire in her eyes
Fire on her waist
Fire on her thighs
I love the scandal
She's so dangerous (dangerous)
She's so dangerous (dangerous)
She's so scandolous (scandolous)
I love the scandal
Hear me sing

Woohoo hear she ocmes
Watch out boys
She'll chew you up
She's dangerous (dangerous)
She's dangerous (dangerous)
I love the scandal

Get crunk lil momma
Lemme see your move
dirty dancing all in the nude
Get crunk and shit
She about 5'6
So I spend the money to see it
I love them girls that belly dance
Drop it down low
And shake that ass
like whoa
Shorty look like a model
Remind me of a coke cola bottle

She a bad ass problem
With her mind on the riches
So bad she pimp bitches
All about that mighty dollah, you
aint talking bread boy
she ain't gonna hollah
seven fo'ty five
She gon' get it
Then you go high
She'll get it
Tell 'em why
She already did it
Her brain
Allright rotate em digits

Black baby
Ramalam
Whoa Black baby
Ramalam

Yeah Black baby
Ramalam

Wow Black Baby
Ramalam
