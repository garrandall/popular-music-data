Baby when the sun is out it's like I'm by myself
Xanax doin' damage make it nice so I can handle it
Baby when the moon is out I'm finally myself
Xanny pills, then I feel my body starving for you

I only call you when I'm faded
Your arms around me, come and save me
I only want you to have my baby
When I'm drunk and I'm down and depressed I just need to confess to you

Baby if I want you, then I know there's something wrong
I don't mean to ruin all the times we had alone
But I'm not my best with you, I'm too depressed with you
But it's so hard, I don't think I can't exist without you

I only call you when I'm faded
Your arms around me, come and save me
I only want you to have my baby
When I'm drunk and I'm down and depressed I just need to confess to you

Baby when the sun is out it's like I'm by myself
Xanax doin' damage make it nice so I can handle it
Baby when the moon is out I'm finally myself
Xanny pills, then I feel my body starving for you
