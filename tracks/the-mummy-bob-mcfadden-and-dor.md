I'm a mummy
I scare people
Watch what happens when I walk up to somebody
I'm a mummy


I was born one thousand nine hundred and fifty-nine years ago
My daddy was a mummy, too
Watch what happens when I walk up to somebody
I'm a mummy


I don't try to scare people
I really came back to life to buy a copy of "Kookie, Kookie, Lend Me Your Comb"
But people run from me
Watch what happens when I walk up to somebody
I'm a mummy


I wish there was somebody somewhere who wasn't afraid of me Oh, well
Watch what happens when I walk up to somebody
I'm a mummy
"That's cool."
I'm a mummy
"You mean you're a mother."
No, I'm a mummy
"I'm a beatnik."
Well, people are afraid of me
"Yeah, I'm hip."
I was born one thousand nine hundred and fifty-nine years ago
"Oh, yeah? Like, that's a long gig."
Where can I buy a copy of "Kookie, Kookie, Lend Me Your Comb"?
"Oooh, man, I don't dig that trash
You know, Brubeck, Shearing, Modern Jazz Quartet?"
I'm a mummy!
"Man, you got a warped groove."
Aren't you afraid of me? Aren't you gonna scream?
"Oh, yeah. Like, 'help.' "
