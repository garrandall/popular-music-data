I'll follow the boys, wherever they go
I'll follow the boys, 'cause in my heart I know
I know that somewhere, somewhere along the way
I'll find my love, my own true love, someday
And there'll be no place too far, no ocean too wide
Wherever he goes, I'll be right by his side
I'll follow the boys, and wait until the time
Till that boy that I'm following is mine
There'll be no place too far, no ocean too wide
Wherever he goes, I'll be right by his side
So I'll follow the boys, and wait until the time
Till that wonderful boy that I'm following is mine
