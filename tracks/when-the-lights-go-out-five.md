Yeah
I like that
You know what I mean
You're looking kinda fly tonight girl
What's up

Check it
Baby when the lights go out
I'll show you what it's all about
Coming at you girl
You know you I like this girl
Here we go
Check it

I ain't sorry for the way I feel
I know you think I'm being insincere
From the way I'm treating you
I never wanted to be so unkind
The only one thing on my mind
Is just kicking it with you girl

Baby it's not the way I feel
You know you must believe me
Baby it's not part of the deal
Oh, no, no
Baby when the lights go out

Every single word cannot express
The love and tenderness
I'll show you what it's all about
Babe I swear you will succumb to me
So baby come to me
When the lights go out
Uh, yeah, check it, check it out
Second verse girl

I know you think it may be just a lie
Ain't no use in putting up a fight
'Cause my heart is set on you

I see the truth its in your eyes
I ain't fooled by your thin disguise
I can see I'm getting through babe
Girl don't deny the way you feel
You know you've gotta trust me
Give a chance to prove I'm real

Oh, yeah, yeah
Baby when the lights go out
Every single word cannot express
The love and tenderness
I'll show you what it's all about

Babe I swear you will succumb to me

So baby come to me
When the lights go out (Baby when the lights go out)
Every single word cannot express
The love and tenderness
I'll show you what it's all about
Babe I swear you will succumb to me
So baby come to me
When the lights go out
When I flick da switch make ya hips want to dip now
I can get you off 'cause I'm ready and equipped now
Swing for me baby give me all that you got

Never want to stop 'cause ya make me feel hot
I know what you want to do and that I feel the same way too
Give me what ya want through the days and the nights

Yeah its about time that we turned out the lights

Yeah
I like that
What's up
Check it
Baby when the lights go out
Every single word cannot express
The love and tenderness
I'll show you what it's all about
Babe I swear you will succumb to me
So baby come to me
When the lights go out (Baby when the lights go out)
Every single word cannot express
The love and tenderness
I'll show you what it's all about
Babe I swear you will succumb to me
So baby come to me
When the lights go out...
