You're all around me, your sweet love surrounds me
And your gentle voice still lingers on and on and on
You're everywhere, your tender love and care
Still remain on everything you touched

Hear you're gone, but your goodness still stays on
And I thank you for these precious memories
For without them it ain't worth living
And I think about the love you've given
And it's almost as if you were here
Right here in my room

Oh, you're all around me
And can't nothing ever, ever bring me down
'Coz you're all around me, all around me
All around me

Whoa, you're all around me, girl
Your tender love is all around me, yeah
Your pretty smile is all, all around me, yeah
Your tender love is all around me, oh
