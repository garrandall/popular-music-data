I found a woman
I felt a true love
She was everything
I'd ever been dreaming of
But she was bad, I didn't know it
Her pretty smile never did show it
All I knew is what I could see
And I knew I wanted her for me
Took her home to mama
Mama, wanna see my future bride
Well she looked at us both
Then she called me to her side
She said
