I got up this morning
While I was having my coffee
My woman came in, sat down by my side
With tears in her eyes
She said Ive a confession to make
I said Woman, speak whats on your mind
She said Ive found somebody new
To take your place
I said don't feel so all alone
Ive found someone of my own
All those lonely nights
You left me all alone
My true love would call
And talk to me on the phone
I said Woman, if thats the way its gotta be
Then darlin, don't you worry about me
She said Ive found somebody new
To take your place
I said don't feel so all alone
Ive found someone of my own
I got up from the table
Reached down and wiped the tears
From her face
I put out my cigarette
Turned and walked away
She said Ive found somebody new
To take your place
I said don't feel so all alone
Ive found someone of my own
