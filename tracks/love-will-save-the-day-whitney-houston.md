Sometimes life can make you crazy 
It can really put your body to the test 
You try so hard to make sure everything goes right 
And you find you've only wound up with a mess 
It's a common situation 
Even though you feel abandoned and alone 
Child, you ain't the first to experience the hurt 
So don't panic when you hit the danger zone 



What you need's a little change of heart 
Forget this fear and frustration 
Love will always play the greater part 
When your battles wear you down 
Here's my advice - 
When you're feeling down and out 
And you've got troubles on you mind 
Love will save the day 
When you're feeling full of doubt 
And fear has got you in a bind 
Love will save the day 
When your worlds falling apart 
All you have to do is say a prayer 
And love will save the day 
There's an answer in your heart 
So let your light shine on my dear 
And love will save the day 
Love will save the day 

Many things in this world bring you down 
It's a wonder you can make it through the day 
Well, you can't sleep cause your problems are to deep 
And there's always something getting in the way 
And when you turn on the evening news 
Mass confusion is the only thing you see 
Well there's no question that we need a new direction 
Cause we all could use some peace and harmony 



Love is gonna save the day 
You've gotta believe it
