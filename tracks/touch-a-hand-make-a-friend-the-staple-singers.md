Can't you feel it in your bones?
The change is coming on
From every walk of life

People seeing the light
Can't you feel it in your heart, now?
A new thing is taking shape
Reach out and touch a hand
Make a friend if you can

Reach out and touch a hand
Make a friend if you can
Reach out and touch a hand
Make a friend if you can

I've read of how to my friends
Any time come on in
We can find a better way
Why don't you join us today?
Can't you feel it in your heart, now?
A new thing is taking shape
Reach out and touch a hand
Make a friend if you can

Reach out and touch a hand
Make a friend if you can
Reach out and touch a hand
Make a friend if you can

It can be effective in the attitude
Of other people just like you
Reach out and touch a hand
Make a friend if you can
Can't you feel it in your heart, now
A new thing is taking shape
Reach out and touch a hand
Make a friend if you can

Reach out and touch a hand
Make a friend if you can
Reach out and touch a hand
Make a friend if you can
