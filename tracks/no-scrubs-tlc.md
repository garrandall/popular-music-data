A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly
He's also known as a busta (Busta, busta)
Always talkin' about what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass


So no, I don't want your number (Uh, uh)
No, I don't want to give you mine and
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere (No, no)
No, I don't want none of your time and (Uh)


No, I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me (Whoo)
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me


Well a scrub checkin' me, but his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
'Cause I'm looking like class and he's looking like trash
Can't get wit' a deadbeat ass (Yeah)


So no, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine and (Said no)
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of your time and (Check it)


No, I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me (Uh uh, come on)
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs (No scrubs)
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me (Uh uh, no love)
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me


If you don't have a car and you're walking
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
If you live at home with your momma
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
If you have a shorty that you don't show love
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
Wanna get me with no money
Oh no, I don't want no
No scrub, love
No scrub, love


No, I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me


See, if you can't spatially expand my horizons
Then that leaves you in the class with scrubs, never rising
I don't find it surprising and if you don't have the G's
To please me and bounce me here to the coast of overseas
So, let me give you something to think about
Inundate your mind with intentions to turn you out
Can't forget the focus on the picture in front of me
You as clear as DVD on digital TV screens
Satisfy my appetite with something spectacular
Check your vernacular, and then I get back to ya
With diamond-like precision, insatiable is what I envision
Can't detect acquisition from your friend's Expedition
Mr. Big Willy, if you really wanna know
Ask Chilli, could I be a silly ho?
Not really, T-Boz and all my se√±oritas
Are steppin' on your FILA's, but you don't hear me, though


No, I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
