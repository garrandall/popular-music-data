'Yo put the kids to bed
Yo Shawty...I know you aint scared


B2k and Nick Cannon..
Trackmasters...the Pied Piper


Yo' the freaks come out at night
I'm like Houdini with the magic stick
When you turn out the lights
Shawty grippin' my stomach tighter
When I burn out on the bike
Holla at the young thugs
What we doing tonight
I'm in the O.J. throwback jersey
Dressed to kill,Bridget won't get it
But Vanessa will,Vanessa's real
Shawty got sex appeal
You can hear this beat bangin from the exit still
Pied Piper, we need something for these chicks to dance
So look Mami Im trying to grind
I'm not trying to romance you
I'm just trying to get them pants loose
Lets get private, 2 way text me
T-Mobile sidekick
One-on-One lets talk and neglect the gossip
I'm as real as they come,Baby girl I got this
My wrist all numb, you can watch the watch gliss
We already bubbly we aint gotta pop Cris'


I come through
My style is powder blue
T's and nike shoes
Plus chicks by the deuce (uh huh)
Ain't no tellin what this man might do
'Cause tonight this man aint playing by the rules
So tell me...
Anybody feelin' freeeeaky?
Anybody feelin' freeeeaky?
Anybody feelin' freeeeaky?
Anybody feelin' freeeeaky?


We tearin' the club like them boys did in the roxy
Million dollar thug like I'm Ted DiBiase
Crack game on the plain
Probably think its Yahtzee
Wrist on rocky, How you gone stop me
Shawty like, "Papi", Crib like "Ozzy's"
Imma show you how to ball girl just watch me
Imma never quit like Whitney & Bobby
Tell them chicks,either wanna get wit me or rob me
Either way I let them strip me, 'cause this is my hobby
After tonight, Shawty will you miss me? Probably
But now I wanna see you shake your little body
Lookin' for a shawty thats freaky & naughty
'Cause after the party you don't have to call me
'Cause Cannon is the prodigy and I mobs deep
If you rollin wit a playa, Mami c'mon
Cause Imma keep it goin 'til 6 o'clock in the morning
OOOH!


I come through
My style is powder blue
T's and nike shoes
Plus chicks by the deuce (uh huh)
Ain't no tellin what this man might do
'Cause tonight this man aint playing by the rules
So tell me...
Anybody feelin' freeeeaky?
Anybody feelin' freeeeaky?
Anybody feelin' freeeeaky?
Anybody feelin' freeeeaky?


We make hits like the mafia (mafia)
After the club hit the lobby, oh (lobby, oh)
Girls always say "Nick you so cute,
How you flippin rappin & actin too?"
Well I do, what I can do, what I can do, when I can do it
It aint algebra baby, its pimpin in my fluid
Why them cats saying that Cannon should stick to acting
Kill you in two bars, Daddy its quick to happen
Wont know what caused it, But Nick will get you dancing
You dudes in the closet, you know you think I'm handsome
Yeah, the kid's real attractive
Even pull hella chicks in a thriller jacket
Now, Thriller's back, And Imma make you clap
Oh that spot yall had? Yeah Im taking that
And them chicks yall dreaming about
We cleaning them out,One on the block
Two in the car, three in the house
Now thats a real six pack, daddy even it out
UH!


Aiiyo...B2k..


I come through
My style is powder blue
T's and nike shoes
Plus chicks by the deuce (uh huh)
Ain't no tellin what this man might do
'Cause tonight this man aint playing by the rules
So tell me...
Anybody feelin' freeeeaky?
Anybody feelin' freeeeaky? (uh huh)
Anybody feelin' freeeeaky?
Anybody feelin' freeeeaky? (uh huh)
