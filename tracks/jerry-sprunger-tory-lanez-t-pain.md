She used to work at King Of Diamonds on a Monday
Only hit the club on Saturday and Sunday
I used to pull up every weekend should've seen her
The way she did it nobody could do it cleaner
I seen her in the suit from her birthday
And I could tell you the reason these niggas thirsty
Lil mama gettin it in on the worst day
Lil mama gettin it in, she fit the school and the gym into her work day
I'm sprung she got me doing the dishes
Held a nigga down with the clippers to an extension
You so bad yeah, you so vicious
I'm so glad that, you not his chick
She wanted a nigga and got the right one
I'm holding it back she looking like fun
Pull up with me baby and spend the night I-
Face it I'm sprung and I-

I can't let you go without me
Shorty got me
Waiting on lil mama tryna lock me
It can't be nobody if it's not me
I'm in the same spot that you dropped me

I can't let you go without me
Shorty got me
Waiting on lil mama tryna lock me
It can't be nobody if it's not me
I'm in the same spot that you dropped me

You, you, you, you, you
You sprung me baby I sprung you too
Too, too, too, too, too
You outdone me baby Imma outdo
You, do, do, do, do
I like a bust it baby Imma bust you too
Too, too, too, too, too
I'm sprung and that's true cause

Ooh, you did it, ooh, didn't you?
I already knew what it takes to get into you
Ooh, bring it back
She put that pussy on me she know how to make it clap, make it clap
I make it clap yo, I make it clap yo
I have them haters asking how you open that Rolls
And have them umbrellas coming out of that door
Have the front doors open up like the back doors I be like
You ain't rich enough
You ain't got my bitch in a Lamborghini, bikini, on a beach sitting up
Now you bitching up, now your bitch with us
She said that champagne nasty, spit it up
Tory took one line and made a hot song
Now the chicks wants tapes I am not y'all
But it's been five times you ain't get yours
Maybe on the next song

I can't let you go without me
Shorty got me
Waiting on lil mama tryna lock me
It can't be nobody if it's not me
I'm in the same spot that you dropped me

I can't let you go without me
Shorty got me
Waiting on lil mama tryna lock me
It can't be nobody if it's not me
I'm in the same spot that you dropped me

You, you, you, you, you
You sprung me baby I sprung you too
Too, too, too, too, too
You outdone me baby Imma outdo
You, do, do, do, do
I like a bust it baby Imma bust you too
Too, too, too, too, too
I'm sprung and that's true cause

I'm sprung, dog she got me
Got me doing things I never do, if you ain't been I'm telling you

I'm sprung, dog she got me
Got me doing things I never do, if you ain't been I'm telling you

You're so sexier to me
Sexier to me
Give a damn who your ex be
I'll be flying to you jet speed
You sexy, make me wanna get messy
Make me wanna give it to you all day all night
In the broad light give a damn who catch me
You sexy, sprung girl you get me
Got me doing things I'd never do, and it's true
