Riding along my pushbike honey
When I noticed you
Riding down town in a hurry honey
Down South Avenue
You looked so pretty
As you were riding along
You looked so pretty
As you were singing this song

Put on the speed
And I tried catching up
But you were pedaling harder too
Riding along like a hurricane honey
Spinning out of view
You looked so pretty
As you were riding along
You looked so pretty
As you were singing this song
Sing this song

Round round wheels going
Round round round
Down up Pedals going
Down up down
But I got to get across to
The other side of town
Before the sun goes down

Now we're riding along on our bicycle honey
That's a bicycle built for two
I'm looking at my honey in the rear view mirror
Now I got a better view
You looked so pretty
As you were riding along
You looked so pretty
As you were singing this song
Sing this song

Round round wheels going
Round round round
Down up Pedals going
Down up down
But I got to get across to
The other side of town
Before the sun goes down
