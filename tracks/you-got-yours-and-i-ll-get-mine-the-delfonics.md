If by chance you feel
That you don't need me
Whoa, oh baby, whoa, oh baby

And if by chance you find
That you can't love me
Whoa, oh baby, whoa, oh baby

Well, now, I'd give the world
To keep you happy
And I'd worry, not a day about me

Because I'll get mine
Hey girl, I'll get mine

And if by chance
You feel you love another
Whoa, oh baby, whoa, oh baby

And I can't give
The love you need, dear
Whoa, oh baby, whoa, oh baby

I would suggest that you be happy
And I'd worry not a day about me

Because I'll get mine
Hey girl, I'll get mine
Every night I dream about you
Hey girl, I'll get mine
Hey girl, I'll get mine

I'll get mine
(You got yours and I'll get mine)
Hey girl, I'll get mine

I'll get mine
(You got yours and I'll get mine)
Hey girl, I'll get mine

I'll get mine
(You got yours and I'll get mine)
Hey girl, I'll get mine
