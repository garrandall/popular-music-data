Trap, TrapMoneyBenny
This shit got me in my feelings
Gotta be real with it, yeah


Kiki, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
KB, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always


Look, the new me is really still the real me
I swear you gotta feel me before they try and kill me
They gotta make some choices, they runnin' out of options
'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin'
And when you get to toppin', I see that you've been learnin'
And when you get to shoppin', you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump that confirmed it

I buy you Champagne but you love some Henny
From the block like you Jenny
I know you special, girl, 'cause I know too many


'Resha, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
J.T., do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always


Two bad bitches and we kissin' in the Wraith
Kissin'-kissin' in the Wraith, kiss-kissin' in the Wraith
I need that black card and the code to the safe
Code to the safe, code-code to the safe-safe
I show him how that neck work
Fuck that Netflix and chill—what's your net-net-net worth?
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, he bad
And I'm down for you always
Yeah, yeah, yeah, guess who's back
And I'm down for you always
D-down for you al–
Black biggy biggy black biggy black blake
D-d-down for you always
I got a new boy, and that nigga trade!


Kiki, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want you, and I need you
And I'm down for you always
KB, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I–


Skate and Smoke and Rap
Now let me see you
Bring that ass, bring that ass, bring that ass back!
B-bring that ass, bring that ass, bring that ass back!
Shawty say the nigga that she with can't hit
But shawty, I'ma hit it, hit it like I can't miss
Now let me see you
Clap that ass, you're the only one I love
Clap that ass, clap-clap that ass!
Bring that ass back!
Clap-clap-clap that ass, you're the only one I love
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Bring that ass back!
