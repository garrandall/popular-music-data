Oh, oh, take me there
Sing

I know a place, y'all
Ain't nobody crying, no
Ain't nobody worried
Ain't no smiling faces
Lying to the races

I said ain't no smiling faces
No smiling faces
Lying to the races
Ain't nobody crying
No more crying

If you're ready now, oh
(Hey) come on
(I'll take you there)
Lord, have mercy
Say if you're ready
(I'll take you there)

Oh, oh (help me, help me)
(I'll take you there)
Come on (hey, hey, yeah)
I said come on
(I'll take you) play it

(Oh, Lord) play on it
Play on the keyboard (yeah)

If you're ready now (I'm ready)
I could use some guitar (me too)
Sounds good

Help me now

If you're ready now
Come on

Mavis

Oh, I, oh, I
I know a place, y'all
Ain't nobody crying
Said there ain't no
Ain't nobody crying
(Help me, help me)

I said, I said ain't no
(Ain't nobody worried)
Nobody worried
(Ain't no smiling faces)
No smiling faces
Lying to the races

Help me now
(I'll take you there)
I said if you're ready (hey)
(I'll take you there)

I said (mercy, y'all)
(I'll take you there)
Come on if you're ready
(Mercy, y'all)
(I'll take you there)

Come on
Ain't nobody crying
(Lord, have mercy)
(Come, go with me)

Let me take you there
(Lord, have mercy)
(Come, go with me)
Help me, Lord
Said mercy, mercy now
(Help me, help me)
(Let them lead the way)

Come, go, come, go with me
Are you ready now
(I'll take you there)
If you think you're ready now
(I'll take you there)

What good times, happy times
(I'll take you there)
Just take my hand and come on
(I'll take you there)

BeBe, CeCe
(I'll take you there)
Can you see it
(I'll take you there)

(Hey, hey)
Wipe the tears from your eyes
(I'm gonna take you there)
(I'll take you there...)
