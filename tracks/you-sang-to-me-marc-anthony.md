I just wanted you to comfort me
When I called you late last night you see
I was fallin' into love
Yes, I was crashin' into love

Oh, of all the words you sang to me
About life, the truth and bein' free
Yeah, you sang to me,
Oh, how you sang to me 

Girl, I live off how you make me feel
So I question all this bein' real
'Cause I'm not afraid to love
For the first time I'm not afraid to love 

Oh, this day seems made for you and me
And you showed me what life needs to be
Yeah, you sang to me,
Oh, you sang to me 

All the while you were in front of me I never realized
I just can't believe I didn't see it in your eyes
I didn't see it,
I can't believe it
Oh, but I feel it
When you sing to me

How I long to hear you sing beneath the clear blue skies
And I promise you this time I'll see it in your eyes
I didn't see it,
I can't believe it
Oh, but I feel it
When you sing to me 

Just to think you live inside of me
I had no idea how this could be
Now I'm crazy for your love
Can't believe I'm crazy for your love

The words you said, you sang to me
And you showed me where I wanna be
Yeah, you sang to me,
Oh, you sang to me

All the while you were in front of me I never realized
I just can't believe I didn't see it in your eyes
I didn't see it,
I can't believe it
Oh, but I feel it
When you sing to me

How I long to hear you sing beneath the clear blue skies
And I promise you this time I'll see it in your eyes
I didn't see it,
I can't believe it
Oh, but I feel it
When you sing to me 

All the while you were in front of me I never realized
I just can't believe I didn't see it in your eyes
I didn't see it,
I can't believe it
Oh, but I feel it
When you sing to me

How I long to hear you sing beneath the clear blue skies
And I promise you this time I'll see it in your eyes
I didn't see it,
I can't believe it
Oh, but I feel it
When you sing to me 

All the while you were in front of me I never realized
I just can't believe I didn't see it in your eyes
I didn't see it,
I can't believe it
Oh, but I feel it
When you sing to me

How I long to hear you sing beneath the clear blue skies
And I promise you this time I'll see it in your eyes
I didn't see it,
I can't believe it
Oh, but I feel it
When you sing to me
