Whose face did I see beside me
When I looked into the mirror, yesterday
Who has tried to keep my spirits
Oh, so high … through yesterday

Who now shares my life and tears
Whenever I cry
Who becomes my wife
And fears the day I die
Who knows all my thoughts
And every word I say

She's the girl who stood beside me
As I looked into the mirror, yesterday

Who then gave a hand to me
When I was tremblin' in the dark, just yesterday
Who then showed me all the nights and all the sights
And all the lights, just yesterday

Who now shares my time
And who now makes my bed
Who now lies beside me
Who now holds my head
Who knows all my thoughts
And every word I say

She's the girl who stood beside me
As I looked into the mirror, yesterday

Whose voice did I hear when bells where ringin'
Silent bird that started singin' … yesterday
Who then said, "Come sit beside me
Oh, my darlin, don't deny me." Yesterday

Who now shares my time
And who now makes my bed
Who now lies beside me
When I hold my head
Who knows all my thoughts
And every word I say

She's the girl who stood beside me
As I looked into the mirror, yesterday

Yes, the girl who stood beside me
As I looked into the mirror, yesterday …
