Whose face did I see beside me
When I looked into
The mirror yesterday?

Whose eyes opened wide
And who has tried
To keep my spirits high
Through yesterday

Who now shares my life?
And tears whenever I cry?
Who becomes my wife?
And fears the day I die?

Who now knows my thoughts
And every word I say?
She's the girl who stood beside me
When I looked into the mirror yesterday

Who then gave her hand to me
When I was trembling in the dark
Just yesterday?

Who then showed me all
The nights and all the sights
And all the lights, just yesterday?

Who now shares my time?
And who now makes my bed?
Who now lies beside me?
Who now holds my head?

Who knows all my thoughts
And every word I say?

She's the girl who stood beside me
When I looked into the mirror yesterday

Whose voice did I hear
When bells where ringing?
Silent birds that started
Singing yesterday

Who then said: "Come sit beside me"
Oh, my darling, don't deny me
Yesterday

Who now shares my time?
And who now makes my bed?
Who now lies beside me?
Who now holds my head?

Who knows all my thoughts
And every word I say?

She's the girl who stood beside me
When I looked into the mirror yesterday

Yes, the girl who stood beside me
As I looked into the mirror yesterday
