Oh, I'm about to dive in, woah
I was thinking about taking a couple laps, I just wanna dive in
Yeah, dive in, yeah


Splash, baby girl, that's your waterfall
Feel it coming down on me, so crazy
Yeah, girl, I love the way your body talk
Come a little closer just like that, keep on talking girl you got me


Wanting to go deeper than you'll ever know
Wanting to feel, the way you flow
Oh, you got that look up in your eyes
What we 'bout to do ain't no surprise


I'm about to dive in
Baby girl, hold your breath
We about to get so wet
Swimming in your body, let me dive in
You know ain't no running 'round this pool
Going under just for you, baby you
Watch me stroke left stroke, right stroke, back stroke
Girl, there ain't no running 'round this pool
Oh, I'm about to dive in
Baby girl, hold your breath
We about to get so wet
Put me to the test girl when I dive


Drip, baby we don't need no towel
I'ma be the one who rub your body now
Won't drown, ain't even coming up for air now
I'll just keep my head down, down, down
Swim for days, I can doggy paddle all kind of ways
Girl you got me


Wanting to go deeper than you'll ever know
Wanting to feel, the way you flow
Oh, you got that look up in your eyes
What we 'bout to do ain't no surprise


I'm about to dive in
Baby girl, hold your breath
We about to get so wet
Swimming in your body, let me dive in
You know ain't no running 'round this pool
Going under just for you, baby you
Watch me stroke left stroke, right stroke, back stroke
Girl, there ain't no running 'round this pool
Oh, I'm about to dive in
Baby girl, hold your breath
We about to get so wet
Put me to the test girl when I dive


Submerged inside your world
So deep inside you girl
Beautiful place to be
So soaking wet and girl, it's made for me


I'm 'bout to dive in
Baby girl, hold your breath
We about to get so wet
Swimming in your body, let me dive in
You know ain't no running 'round this pool
Going under just for you, baby you
Watch me stroke left stroke, right stroke, back stroke
Read the signs, there ain't no running
I'm about to dive in
Baby girl, hold your breath
We about to get so wet
Put me to the test girl when I dive
Oh girl, when I dive
Dive
