One, two, three!
Good lovin', good lovin'
Good lovin', good lovin'


I was feelin' so bad
I asked my family doctor just what I had
I said "Doctor (Doctor), Mr. M.D. (Doctor)
Now can you tell me what's ailin' me?" (Doctor)


He said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
Yes indeed, all I, I really need


Good lovin', now gimme that good, good lovin'
Good lovin', all I need is lovin'
Good lovin', good, good lovin', baby
Good lovin'


Honey, please squeeze me tight (squeeze me tight)
Don't you want your baby to be all right? (be all right)
I said baby (baby), "Now it's for sure (it's for sure)
I got the fever, yeah, and you got the cure"


Everybody, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yes indeed, all I really need


Good lovin', come on, now gimme that lovin'
Good lovin', all I need is lovin'
Good lovin', good, good lovin', baby
Good lovin'


Good lovin', good lovin'
Good lovin', all I need is lovin'
Good lovin', all I want is lovin'
Good lovin', lovin' early in the morning
Good lovin', lovin' late at night
Good lovin', love is love
Good lovin', love, love, love, love, love
