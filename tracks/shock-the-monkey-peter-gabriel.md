Cover me when I run
Cover me through the fire
Something knocked me out ' the trees
Now I'm on my knees
Cover me, darling please
Monkey, monkey, monkey
Don't you know you're going to shock the monkey

Fox the fox
Rat on the rat
You can ape the ape
I know about that
There is one thing you must be sure of
I can't take any more
Darling, don't you monkey with the monkey
Monkey, monkey, monkey
Don't you know you're going to shock the monkey
Shock the monkey

Monkey, Wheels keep turning
Monkey, Something's burning
Monkey, Don't like it but I guess I'm learning
Shock! Shock! Shock! - watch the monkey get hurt, monkey

Monkey, Wheels keep turning
Monkey, Something's burning
Monkey, Don't like it but I guess I'm learning
Shock! Shock! Shock! - watch the monkey get hurt, monkey

Monkey, Too much at stake 
Monkey, Ground beneath me shake
Monkey, And the news is breaking
Shock! Shock! Shock! - watch the monkey get hurt, monkey

Shock the monkey, shock the monkey
Shock the monkey, shock the monkey
Shock the monkey to life
