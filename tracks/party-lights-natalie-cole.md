I see the party lights
Shining in the night
Make me feel all right

I see the party lights
Shining in the night
Really out of sight

I see reflections going in the air
Telling me the way to move
I feel the spirit and it's everywhere
Telling me it's time to groove

I see the party lights
Shining in the night
Make me feel all right
Mm, yeah

I see the party lights
Shining in the night
Really out of sight

I must get out
I'm going crazy here
The time has come for me to say

Goodbye to all the
Things I used to fear
So long to lonely yesterday

I see the party lights
Shining in the night
Make me feel all right

Oh, I see the party lights
Shining in the night
Really out of sight

Whoa, oh, come on
Party with me, children
Come on, party with me
Down, get down, get down
Come on, party with me
Down, get down

I see the party lights
They're shining in the night
Oh, make me feel all right
Oh, really feel right, yeah

I see the party lights
They're shining in the night
Can't you see them, out of sight

Whoa, oh
I've got to leave here
And I won't look back, no, no
I'll sing tomorrow with the sky

Yes, I have, I've got the
Sunshine in a paper sack
Would you believe
I've got new wings and I can fly

I see the party lights
They're shining in the night
Oh, make me feel all right
I feel all right

I see the party lights
Shining in the night
Really out of sight
Let's get away, let's go

Come on, party with me, children
Hey, come on, party with me
Down, get down, get down
Come on, party with me, children
Yeah, yeah, come on, party with me
Down, get down, get down

Come on, party with me, children
Yeah, yeah, come on, party with me
Down, get down, get down, get down
Come on, party with me, children
Yeah, yeah, come on, party with me
Oh, oh, oh, ho ha

Party, party, party
Party hard, party, oh

I see the party lights
Shining in the night
Oh, make me feel all right
Can't you see them
Can't you see them

I see the party lights
Shining in the night
Oh, yeah, out of sight

I see the party lights
Shining in the night
Oh, feel all right
Let's go, come on

Party lights, let's go, yeah
In the night out of sight
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, yeah

Party lights
Shining in the night
Just for me, feel all right
Well, oh, oh

Party lights
Shining in the night
Out of sight
