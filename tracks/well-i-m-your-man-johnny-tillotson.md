Rocking queen with eyes of blue
Looking for a love that's true
A boy to kiss and hold your hand
Oh believe me girl, well I'm your man
Well I'm your man

Tight blue jeans that fit so snug
You're the girl I wanna hug
And I'm the boy who thinks you're grand
Oh believe me girl, well I'm your man
Well I'm your man

Well, everything you say and do
Suits me to a T
And I'd be very set for life
You'd go steady with me

Well rocking queen, my heart's a-whirl
Won't you be my steady girl
No one loves you like I can
And believe me girl, well I'm your man
Well I'm your man

Well, now everything you say and do
Suits me to a T
And I'd be very set for life
You'd go steady with me

Well rocking queen, my heart's a-whirl
Won't you be my steady girl
No one loves you like I can
And believe me girl, well I'm your man
Well I'm your man
Well I'm your man
Well...
