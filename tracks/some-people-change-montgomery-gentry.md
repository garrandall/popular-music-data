His old man was a rebel yeller...
Bad boy to the bone.
He'd say: "Can't trust that other fella,"
He'd judge 'em by the tone of their skin.
He was raised to think like his Dad...
Narrow mind full of hate.
On the road to no-where fast,
Till the Grace of God got in the way.
Then he saw the Light and hit his knees and cried and said a prayer...
Rose up a brand new man; left the old one right there.

Here's to the strong; thanks to the brave.
Don't give up hope... some people change.
Against all odds, against the grain,
Love finds a way... some people change.

She was born with her mother's habit...
You could say: "It's in her blood."
She hates that she's gotta have it...
As she fills her glass up.
An she'd love to kill that bottle,
But all she can think about,
Is a, a better life, a second chance,
An' everyone she's letting down.
She throws that bottle down.

Here's to the strong; thanks to the brave.
Don't give up hope... some people change.
Against all odds, against the grain,
Love finds a way... some people change.

Thank God for those who make it...
Let them be the Light.

(Let them be the light)
(Some people change.)
Here's to the strong; thanks to the brave.
Don't give up hope... some people change.
Against all odds, against the grain,
Love finds a way... some people change.
Some people change.

(Some people change)
