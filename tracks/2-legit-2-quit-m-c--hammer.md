Too legit... Too legit to quit
Sweat running all over my chest
I don't quit no!
I just press harder
Than I ever did before going for
The dreams that I have in store
In my mind (mind) and I know
That I'm makin it I gotta
Get mine and nobody's takin it away
(No!) cause Hammer don't play that
You try to get mine
Boy you better step back freeze (freeze) cause
You don't want none I hustle
For my muscle and you look
Weak son (real weak) yea!...
I'm goin for all that I can get
Kickin at the top cause I'm too legit to quit...sing!..


Too legit... Too legit to quit
(Hey...hey...)
Too legit, too legit to quit..


When I feel high post don't
You play me close a dig 'em smack
A get you back and i'll
Hit with a dose of Oaktown power
And charge you by the hour
I'm shakin like a quake and funks
Get devoured I choose to abuse, misuse and confuse
Competitors who think
They're makin up all the rules, fools
In the game lame and insane
It's a shame I gotta do this but
I remain the same unchanged
Gettin better never known
As a sweater kickin it at the
Top cause I got myself together
So roll with a guy who's
Physical and fit knows the time
And too legit to quit...sang!


Too legit... Too legit to quit
(Hey...hey...)
Too legit, too legit to quit..


Step to the rhythm of a
Sho-nuff winner (winner) I been
Here before (yo!) I ain't no
Beginner (word) but I been new
Tried and true survival of the fittest
Yo!..it brought me through
My crew (talk) we're ready to
Strike trained for the mission
So believe the hype and sweat it
Cause you're gonna
Regret it the day that you dissed us
You'll wish you never met us
You remind me of a real short
Story one hit record and you
Star to bore me get ready
Cause this is it your crew is
Through and we too legit to quit...sang!..


Too legit... Too legit to quit
(Hey...hey...)
Too legit, too legit to quit..


My people we don't know defeat
We crush the strong and
Percolate the weak daily
(Everyday) we make our moves to
Improve our groove because we love to rule where we
Lay yo!..(Yo!) work and play
We started at the bottom and
Now we're leading the way and yea!
I'm havin a fit kickin it
At the top because I'm too legit to quit - sing!
