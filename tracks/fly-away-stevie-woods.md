You're an anchor, I'm a kite
You're what gets me through the night
You keep me steady and on course
Until I found you, I was lost
But you're the up, I'm the sky
And sometimes if I go too high
Then pull the string
That pulls me back
If not for you, I might lose track
And I might fly away
Oh, I might fly away
And go my own way
To places that
We've never been together
I might fly away
Take to the sky someday
But not for now, not today
Nobody here is flying away
Away
You have reasons, I have dreams
So we're perfect so it seems
You tell fortunes, I tell the truth
Kept me from my crazy youth
When you're near me, I feel whole
I don't have to rock and roll
I don't worry, I don't think
But baby, hold me
'Cause I might break
I just might fly away
Oh, I might fly away
And go my own way
To places that we've
Never been together
I might fly away
Take to the sky someday
But not for now, not today
Nobody here is flying
Flying away
Oh, I might fly away
I might fly away
But not for now, not today
Nobody here is flying
Oh, I might fly away
I might fly away
Take to the sky someday
But not for now
