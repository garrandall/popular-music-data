All my life I wanted to fly
Like the birds that you see way up in the sky
Making circles in the morning sun
Flying high in the sky 'til the day is done
(I can't break away)
Like a child in his fantasy
Punching holes in the walls of reality
All my life I wanted to fly
But I don't have the wings and I wonder why
(I can't breakaway)

Woah, well mama told me
When I was young
Stand tall girl
Your number one
(she said)
But you can't be what you wanna be
But you can shake the course of your destiny
I can't break away
(omina, doke doe, onimea)
Well no, no ,no ,no, no
I can't break away
(omina, doke doe, ominea)
Oh yeah

One is one
(one)
And two is two
(two)
You want me
And I hang you
Black is Black (black is black)
And white is white (white is white)
So come out in the middle
'Till midnight
I can't break away
(omina, doke doe, ominea)
Well no, no ,no ,no, no
I can't break away
(omina, doke doe, ominea)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah-heh-heh

Well mama told me
When I was young
Stand tall girl (stand tall girl)
Your number one (your number one)
(she said)
You can't be what you wanna be
But you can change the course of your destiny
I can't break away
(omina, doke doe, ominea)
No, no, no ,no, no
I can't break away
(omina, doke doe, ominea)
I can't, I can't, I can't break away
(omina, doke doe, ominea)
No, no, no., no, no
I can't breakaway
(omina, doke doe, ominea)
Woo ooo ooo oh oh
I can't break away (I can't break away)
