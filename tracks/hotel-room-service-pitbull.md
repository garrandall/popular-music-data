I want everybody to stop what they're doing.
Now if you know you're with somebody you're gonna take the hotel room tonight, make some noise...

Meet me at the hotel room


Forget about your boyfriend and meet me at the hotel room,
You can bring your girlfriends and meet me at the hotel room

We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn

She like that freaky stuff
2 in the O, 1 in the eye,
That kinky stuff, you nasty,
But I like your type
And like T.I. it's whatever you like.
Bring your girls,
It's whatever tonight,
Your man just left,
I'm the plumber tonight,
I'll check your pipes,
Oh, you're the healthy type.
Well, here goes some egg whites.
Now gimme that sweet, that nasty, that gooshy stuff,
Let me tell you what we gon' do.

2 + 2, I'm gonna undress you.
Then we're gonna go 3 and 3 you gon' undress me.
Then we're gon' go 4 and 4,
We gon' freak some more, but first...


Forget about your boyfriend and meet me at the hotel room,
You can bring your girlfriends and meet me at the hotel room

We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn

After party in hotel lobby,
Then we off to the room like vroom,
With them fingers in yo mouth or open up yo blouse,
And pull that g-sting down south (oh)
OK shawty, 1's company, 2's a crowd, and 3's a party.
If your girl ain't with it, I got somebody,
And by nature she's naughty.
Now gimme that sweet, that nasty that gooshy stuff.
Ima tell you what we gon' do,

2 + 2, I'm gon' undress you.
Then we gon' go 3 and 3, you gon' undress me.
Then we gonna go 4 and 4,
We gon' freak some more, but first...


Forget about your boyfriend and meet me at the hotel room,
You can bring your girlfriends and meet me at the hotel room

We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
