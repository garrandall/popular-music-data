Feat. The Notorious B.I.G. & 2Pac

Check it, I grew up a fuckin screwup
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin blew up
Choppin rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryin ta turn into the black Frank White

It's a red light
How many homies got to die tonight
Stop the gunfight
I can feel it
Somebodys tryin' to start up a fight
Come on and peep game
But ya cannot cease the blame
And if u ask me
It's a damn shame
We be takin' lives that we can't replace
Over B.S. that don't make sense
We gotta get better than this
We started fightin' at our own risk
It was something we could resist
It's a red light
How many homied got to die tonight

We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops on the milk box missin
Show they toes you know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police picture that, nigga I'm too fat
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack (heavy breathing)
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he drop, take his Glock, and I'm Swayze
Summer break, my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Laid back, I got some money to make, motherfucker

From tha 5-0
Duckin and dodgin in my survival
The Benzo and I let off with my nine
I'm movin swifter than the next nigga, no time for sex
Cause in my mind all I wonder is who's next
Nigga, my homey slipped and now he pays the price
He did a driveby, sixteen, now he's doin triple life
Tell me is it me or my upbringin
I split that dove shit
Nigga motherfuck singin, I hope you got your Timberlands
On tight, cause I ain't givin up
I'd rather duck these motherfuckers all night
I'm runnin' through the projects, beyotch
They'll never catch me
Cause I'm lock and trigger happy on the, seotch
Don't say you never heard of me, til they murder me, I'm a legend
Do Thug Niggas go to heaven?
I'm rollin with the thorough heads
We gettin ghost on them hoes and yo
I got no love for the 5-0 I'm runnin' from the police

Stop the gunfight
I can feel it
Somebodys tryin' to start up a fight
Come on and peep game
But ya cannot cease the blame
And if you ask me
It's a damn shame
We be takin' lives that we can't replace
You got swishers in your system
Juice up in you
Now you're ready to get lose
Over what he said
Over what she said
Now somebody gotta end up dead
