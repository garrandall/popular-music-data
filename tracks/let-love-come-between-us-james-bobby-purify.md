Baby I found a way to stop all this fussin', yeah
It's just not right darling
The way that we fight
Girl, if you would listen to what we have to say
We could stop all this fussin'
And we could do it this way
We could let love come between us
And let love bring us together
And let love be born today
And let love, let love live forever
I don't believe that you realize
How much I need you darling
And the way my heart cries
It's so hard for us to get alone
And if you'd only listen to the words of our song
And let love come between us
And let love bring us together
And let love be born today
And let love, let love live forever
