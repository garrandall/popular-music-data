One look at you
One night with you
Suddenly I fell in love with you
Oh my darling, my darling
You're my dream come true

The night is young and I believe
That destiny brought you to me
Oh my darling, my darling
You're my dream come true

I shall always love you
I will always care
And should you love somebody new
I'll always picture you there

I misty blue
While you're away
I'll love you, my darling
Until my dying day
Oh my darling, my darling
You're my dream come true

Oh my darling, my darling
You're my dream come true
