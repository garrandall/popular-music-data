Hey Jack you better get right
Or Jill won't be impressed
Hey Jill you better get right
'Cause Jack expects the best

The temperature is risin' and exitement's in the air
Girls buy new bikinis and beauticians dye their hair
Health clubs are overcrowded with young men
Concerned and unhappy with conditions that they're in

So hey Jack you better get right
Or Jill won't be impressed
Hey Jill you better get right
'Cause Jack expects the best

Sports cars, hot rods, Cadillacs and Jeeps
Pretty girls sittin' on the beach admiring men's physiques
Bands of motorcyclists are riding through the parks
Diggin' girls in mini skirts, and try'n to win their hearts

So hey Jack you better get right
Or Jill won't be impressed
Hey Jill you better get right
'Cause Jack expects the best

Summer nights and city lights create an atmosphere
Girls and boys begin to dance to the music that they hear
Jack you better look your best 'cause competition's tough
Jill you better wear a mini skirt that's short enough

So hey Jack you better get right
Or Jill won't be impressed
Hey Jill you better get right
'Cause Jack expects the best

Hey Jack you better get right
Or Jill won't be impressed
Hey Jill you better get right
Cause Jack expects the best
