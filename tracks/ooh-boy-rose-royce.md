Ooh boy, I love you so
Never ever, ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh boy, I love you so
Never ever, ever gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way too

I watch you walk by my window
And I don't even know your name
But my heart skips a beat and I feel weak
When my eyes tell my heart here he comes again

So many things I want to say
But each time I see you, boy, the words just seem to fade away
Infatuation, love at first sight
I don't know, I just know the feeling is right

Ooh boy, I love you so
Never ever, ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh boy, I love you so
Never ever, ever gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way too

Talk going around town
They say you love a girl and then you put her down
I hope with all my heart that it's not true
Cause, boy, I'd wanna share my love with you

I know that's it not right, nor is it ladylike
For a girl to come right out and tell a guy how she feels
But I want you to know that deep down in my soul
I'm experiencing something wonderful and new

And it's you, boy, I love you so
Never ever, ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh boy, I love you so
Never ever, ever gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way too

Oh, when I go to bed at night
I hold my pillow tight
Pretending that it's you
If I had one wish, and wishes came true
I'd wish to be able to say these words to you

Ooh boy, I love you so
Never ever, ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh boy, I hope with all my might
You feel the same way too

Ooh boy, I love you so
Never ever, ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh boy, I wish I could make
This dream come true

Ooh boy, I love you so
Never ever, ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh boy, I hope with all my might
You feel the same way too
