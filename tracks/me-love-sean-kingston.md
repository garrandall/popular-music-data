Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Why do you have to go?
Away from all
Me love.


See the first time me looking at your eyes
Me be tell you want a guy like me (Guy like me)
We use to have good times on the evening
Me and you chilling on the beach (On the beach)
We use to kiss and caress an chess me
Girl it feels so sweet (Feels so sweet)
Then one day you move
Now I'm feeling kinda blue
Cause we had to see you leave (You leave)


I feel like I'm drowning in the ocean
Somebody come and take me away
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Why do you have to go?
Away from all
Me love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Why do you have to go?
Away from all
Me love


Now I'm sittin' in a chair with no one here
And I'm feelin all alone (All alone)
Thinkin to myself like
Damn, why my baby up and gone (Up and gone)
It's like I'm missin' her and I know she's missin' me (Missin' me)
It's been two years an a half in july will make it three. (Make it three)




Why you leave me, w-why you leave me?
Baby tell me, b-baby tell me
Why you leave me, w-why you leave me?
Why you leave me?

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
(Why you leave me, w-why you leave me)
(Baby tell me, b-baby tell me)
Why'd you have to go?
(Why you leave me, w-why you leave me)
(Baby tell me, b-baby tell me)
Away from all
Me love
