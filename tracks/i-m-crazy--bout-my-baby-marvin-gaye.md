It takes a real good woman to know how to love a good man
It takes some hugging and kissing, but most of all some understanding
And I've got all of the hugging and kissing and understanding I want


That's why I'm crazy 'bout my baby
Crazy about my baby
Mad about my baby
And I know for sure she crazy 'bout me


Now you can talk about your real fine chicks, say they're nice and sweet as they can be
But I've got a woman suits me to a T
Now she may not look like Venus, she's good enough for me


And I'm crazy 'bout my baby
Crazy about my baby
Wild about my baby
And it's plain to see she crazy 'bout me


Now me and my baby, yeah, yeah, we're doing all right
We love one another, vow to treat each other right
Now I've got enough woman to last me for the rest of my life


I'm crazy 'bout my baby
Mad about my baby
Wild about my baby
So wild about my baby
And I know for sure she crazy 'bout me
I'm crazy 'bout my baby
I'm crazy 'bout my baby
