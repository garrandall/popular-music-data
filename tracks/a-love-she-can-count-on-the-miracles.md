Everyday, I'm gonna love become what may
'Cause I know that there is nothing that means more
To a woman than a love that she can count on
Yeah oh oh oh oh oh

Darling dear yeah (ohooh
Whenever when you need me I'll be here (ohooh
'Cause I know that there is nothing that means more
To a woman than a love that she can count on

Repeat after me now

I remember one day it come to me (I remember one day it come to me)
The guy next door has money you see (the guy next door has money you see)
Oh you know he buys his woman everything yeah (he buys his woman everything)
Oh he buys her cars and clothes and diamond rings (cars and clothes and diamond rings)
And although she may want the things he's buying (tho she accepts the things he's buying)
What she needs is his love sometimes (really needs his love sometime)
So baby I want you to see yeah (baby I want you to see)
Oh that you can always count on me
Yeah count on me to comfort you yeah (comfort you)
When you start to feeling sad and blue (sad and blue)
'Cause I know that there is nothing that means more (Yeah I'm here to tell ya)
To a woman than a love that she can count on
(Nothing that means more to a woman)
Yeah ask any woman about it
(Nothing that means more to a woman)
Yeah yeah tell you they can't do without it
(Nothing that means more to a woman)
I know that you know how precious this girl is
And you know that I know my darling that there is
(Nothing that means more to a woman)
Yeah not in the whole wide world
(Nothing that means more to a woman)
