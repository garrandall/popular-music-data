Early mornin' lookin' tired and worn
And lookin' out for the enemy
You made all the way to Hudson Bay
But you're right back here with me
Tryin' to run away
Your lips are sealed

A runaway
So tell me baby
What you're wantin' me to do
Givin' my love to you
Mama don't you know
Now you're livin' like a runaway
Sunday dawn you met a Gypsy woman
On a road to Tennessee
She told you a lot about the world to come
But did she tell you
Why you couldn't tell me
Like a runaway
How one by one you run away
Now tell me baby
What you want me to do
Givin' all my love to you
Mama don't you know

It's gonna be a hard leavin'
You're gonna need a strong reason
'Cause I ain't gonna start believin'
That you're out of my life
You bet you better do your fast talkin'
Before you do your last walkin'
It's gonna be a hard hard leavin' (talk to me)
Vox humana
I wanta feel the power of speech
Vox humana
Sounds so right so real to me
Vox humana
You gotta say
What you oughtta say
Don't try to run away
Darlin' I'm lettin' you know
