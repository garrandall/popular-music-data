I saw you in the supermarket, looking like a worker department
Everyone had told me you were dead
Radiating happiness while I spilled chocolate on my dress
Then I turned to pretty shade of red

On the trail of who I was
You fit me like a pair of gloves
Years went by, what was it that was said

I can't remember why
Do you remember why?
I can't remember why
I was ever mad at you?

I'm feeling like an idiot, 'cause I forget what you went and did
I'm certain it was some kinda mistake
I was young and broke your heart, I was needy
Was it smart for me to break it up and run way

Is this a well learned lesson
Doesn't makes me a better person than I was
Even if to have you, it's too late

I can't remember why
Do you remember why?
I can't remember why
I was ever mad at you?

Post traumatic suicide
We kill the love we keep inside
Now I know I should have had more faith

I can't remember why
Do you remember why?
I can't remember why
I was ever mad at you?

I can't remember why
I can't remember why

I can't remember why
I can't remember why
I can't remember why
I can't remember
