It's an ill wind
That blows no good
And it's a sad heart
That won't love like it should
Oh, how lonesome
I know you must be
And it's a shame
If you don't share
Your love with me

It's a heartache
(It's a heartache)
When love is gone
(When the love is gone)
And it's bad (and it's bad)
And you know it's even sad
(You know it's even sad)
Later on (later on)
There's no one blinder
Than he who just won't see
And it's a shame (it's a shame)
If you don't share
(If you don't share)
Your love with me

I can't help it (I can't help it)
Oh, no (I can't help it)
If he is gone
(I can't help it if he's gone)
You must try to forget
You must live on (you must live on)
And whoooooa, how lonesome
I know you must be
And it's a shame (it's a shame)
If you don't share
(If you don't share)
Your love with me
Whooooa, yeah
Well, it's a shame (it's a shame)
You don't share
Your love with me
(Share your love with me)
It's a shame
