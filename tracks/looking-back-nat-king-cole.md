Guess I'll go back home this summer
Should have gone there long ago
I wonder who I'll meet
When I walk up Main Street
Who'll yell the first "Hello!"?

Guess I'll go back home this summer
Mum will cry when I walk in
She'll brush away a tear
As Dad says, "Look who's here!
We're glad you're home again!"

After we've talked of everything
Then I'll get a restless spell
I'll walk by the house
Where she used to live
I hope she married well

Guess I'll go back home this summer
Leave this daily grind behind
There's nothing wrong I'm sure
That going home won't cure
I'll find my peace of mind!
