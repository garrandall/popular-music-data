Real dope dealers forreal!
Haha! Hahaha

Young nigga move that dope They move that dope, they move that dope
Young nigga move that dope
Young nigga, young nigga move that dope
Young nigga move that dope
They move that dope, they move that dope
Young nigga move that dope

Whippin' the yam, whippin and flippin' the yam
Turn the whole brick to a Lam
Been rockin' the dope, soon as it get off the boat
Keepin' it soft like a mink
Gold on my link, coke in the sink
Choppin' that work like karate
Servin' a new Maserati, in a brand new Maserati
That's a whole lot of new money
Snatch it, then hide it from 12
Movin' and squashin' them bells, servin' the rawest of yayo
Beating that china like Kunta Kinte
Whippin' it, whippin' that fish and Parkay
Drinkin' on syrup, I'm rollin' up haze
Made myself a boss, a boss or a plug
Either way you put it, nigga, I'm good
Triple salute, nigga, straight out the hood
Bakin' soda water splash the scales
Fork in my right and my pot in my left
Leanin' over, over to the side, I whip me a four way to a nine
The dirty, the money is homicide and my recipe can't be televised

Young enough to still sell dope, but old enough that I knows better
When they sayin' it's 42 for that white powder, I knows better
Get it nigga? I nose better, put a smile on the devil's face
Who don't wanna sell dope forever and flood their Rollie 'til the bezel break?
Woo! Fish scale in the two-door that I fish-tails
Fiberglass, Ferrari leather, in designer shit that I misspell
YUGHH! Look at the clues, the J's, the jewels, I'm actin' a monkey
From sixteen years old, I'm whippin' in kitchens, fuckin' my junkies
Pablo, Versace way before Migos
My dinner plates, no silverware, all you niggas my E-hoes
Toss a kilo like a free throw, crack house, it had the peephole
Made it through to the other side, now nothing's big as my ego, Push

Me, I try to leave the best for later
But Pusha tried to put me on the respirator
The old Skateboard P, that's your favorite
Me and twenty girls doin' yoga naked
Frequency high, like a spaceship
She say that she like it and she's been exposed
The Gandalf hat and the weird ass clothes
That's Comme des Gar√ßons and the Buffalo
I know guerrillas with the triggers that's on a banana clip
And packin' with the biggest missiles
These niggas is knocking over vehicles
These niggas ain't waitin' just to see niggas
These niggas ain't tryna hear plea niggas
These niggas like choppin' down trees, niggas
These niggas 1-2-3 and they squeeze, niggas
These niggas hit the weed then they leave niggas, gee, nigga
If you got two hoes, you need to let one go
Two Lambos, you need to let one go
All these drones while y'all smoke dro
There's an eye in the sky, I'm tryna let y'all know
Ain't no standards, I'ma set one though
Big ass bag but no man sandals
All that war, we need to let that go
That boom business, I'ma get that ho

Young nigga got that coke, whip that dope like a batter
How you think about that coupe, with no roof? Young nigga cashed out
Pass me the purp, pass me the zan, young nigga 'bout to pass out
12 jump from behind her, I got some in the car, young nigga 'bout to smash out
Migo hit that line, say he got some bricks, young fresh, 'bout to buy 'em out
QuikTrip 'round the corner, dropped a nine
Got the J's in the hood tryna smoke a line
Cocaine, cocaine cowboy, like Mickey Munday
Take over the project, whip a line, me no wait
I keep a 45 in my coat, while I'm servin' dope
J's in my hood smoke that crack, say it give 'em hope
Serve a nigga whole brick, he hopin' that it come and go
Young nigga turnt up, spend that money with Casino!
