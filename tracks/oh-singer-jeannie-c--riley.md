Oh singer sing me an old song yeah
Oh singer sing me an old song sing me an old song about cotton bales
Tell me how the good earth feels down in the high white cotton yeah
Cause in my life I'll never get to walk on my knees in the fields

Oh singer sing about the railroad
Sing about a coal shovellin' fireman on the L&N rail
Let me gather 'round the fire with all the people in the depot
Cause in my life singer I'll never ride those coal fired trains

Take me back oh singer take me back
I'm livin' a life I can't slow down cept with a song
And I wanna know how the people made it without the big corporations
And I wanna feel how the people lived when life was slow

Oh singer take me to the river
Let me ride the big river boat down to New Orleans
Let me lean overboard and wash my hands in the Mississipi water
Cause singer I can only ride that boat in a song you sing

Take me back oh singer take me back...
I'm Livin a life I can't slow down cept with a song
And I wanta know how the people made it without a big corporation
And I wanta feel how the people lived when life was slow
Oh singer sing me an old song yeah
Sing me an old song about cotton bales
Tell me how the good earth feels down in the high white cotton yeah
Cause in my life I'll never get to walk on my knees in the fields
In the fields
