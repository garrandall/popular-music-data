That's my girl


Yeah, who's been working so damn hard?
You got that head on overload?
Got yourself this flawless body
Aching now from head to toe


Ain't nothing, ain't nothing
All my ladies 'round the world
Ain't nothing, ain't nothing
(Good girls better get bad)


You've been down before
You've been hurt before
You got up before
You'll be good to go, good to go


Destiny said it, you got to get up and get it
Get mad independent and don't you ever forget it
Got some dirt on your shoulder, then let me brush it off for ya
If you're feeling me, put your five high
That's my girl


That's my girl
That's my girl
That's my girl
Get up, what you waiting for?
That's my girl
That's my girl
That's my girl
Oh


Nod if you been played by every boo
Just tryna show you off
Thought he was the best you ever had
Until he cut you off


Ain't nothing, ain't nothing
Bet you bet you know your worth
Ain't nothing, ain't nothing
(Good girls better get bad)


You've been down before
You've been hurt before
You got up before
You'll be good to go, good to go


Destiny said it, you got to get up and get it (get up and get it)
Get mad independent and don't you ever forget it (don't you ever forget it)
Got some dirt on your shoulder, then let me brush it off for ya
If you're feeling me, put your five high
That's my girl


That's my girl
That's my girl
That's my girl
What you wait, what you wait
What you waiting for?
That's my girl (Oh) (Oh!)
That's my girl (Oh) (That's my girl)
That's my girl


You've been down before
You've been hurt before
You got up before
You'll be good to go, good to go
(Don't ever give up, no, no woah)


Destiny said it, you got to get up and get it
Get mad independent and don't you ever forget it
Got some dirt on your shoulder, then let me brush it off for ya
If you're feeling me, put your five high


That's my girl


That's my girl
That's my girl
That's my girl
What you wait, what you wait
What you waiting for?
That's my girl (Oh)
That's my girl (Oh)
That's my girl (Oh)
(That's my girl, that's my girl, that's my girl...)


Ain't nothing, ain't nothing, ain't nothing
Put your heart and your soul in it
Ain't nothing, ain't nothing, ain't nothing (Ain't nothing)
Now put your heart and your soul in it


That's my girl
That's my girl
(That's my girl)


That's my girl
That's my girl
That's my girl
That's my girl
