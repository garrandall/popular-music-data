The sun is hot and that old clock is movin' slow
An' so am I
Work day passes like molasses in wintertime
But it's July
I'm gettin' paid by the hour, and older by the minute
My boss just pushed me over the limit
I'd like to call him somethin'
I think I'll just call it a day


Pour me somethin' tall and strong
Make it a "Hurricane" before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere


Oh, this lunch break is gonna take all afternoon
An' half the night
Tomorrow mornin', I know there'll be hell to pay
Hey, but that's all right
I ain't had a day off now in over a year
Our Jamaican vacation's gonna start right here
If the phoneâ€™s for me
You can tell 'em I just sailed away


And pour me somethin' tall and strong
Make it a "Hurricane" before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere


I could pay off my tab, pour myself in a cab
An' be back to work before two
At a moment like this, I can't help but wonder
What would Jimmy Buffett do?
Funny you should ask Alan I'd say
"Pour me somethin' tall and strong
Make it a "Hurricane" before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care"
Pour me somethin' tall and strong
Make it a "Hurricane" before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care
He don't care
I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere


What time zone am I on? What country am I in?
It doesn't matter, it's five o'clock somewhere
It's always on five in Margaritaville, come to think of it
Yeah, I heard that
You been there haven't you
Yessir
I seen your boat there
I've been to Margaritaville a few times
All right, that's good
Stumbled all the way back
Okay, just wanna make sure you can keep it between the navigational beacons
Ha ha ha, between the buoys, I tell you
All right. Well, it's five o'clock. Let's go somewhere
I'm ready, crank it up
Let's get out of here
I'm gone
