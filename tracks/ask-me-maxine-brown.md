Y'all got the last 
Y'all 
Asking me questions
Like who is this girl right here?
I don't need the pressure
Getting you faded
Let me explain it


I wish it was easy to love me
I wish it was easy to love
I wish it was easy to love me
I ain't the one, I ain't the one
I wish it was easy to love me
I wish it was easy to love me babe
I wish it was easy to love me
I ain't the one, I ain't the one


Met a pretty girl like Maxine
Brown skin, beautiful black queen
So thick man, you know she got them mad genes
Just sick of the bullshit, you need a vacine
And you ride or die, you'll dance with fire
Them parts I admire
You've got a little backchat
'Cause you smart like 
Yeah, I know this ain't what you're used to
Got you whipped on a voodoo
You said I'm not the one
Well pass me the spliff, let me twos you
Attention from the girls, you don't rate that
I'm not easy to love and you hate that
You know it comes with the game, I can't change that
It's a shame 'cause I just...

I wish it was easy to love me
I wish it was easy to love
I wish it was easy to love me
I ain't the one, I ain't the one
I wish it was easy to love me
I wish it was easy to love me babe
I wish it was easy to love me
I ain't the one, I ain't the one


Yeah, just cool nuh
Your ex-boyfriend was a warmup
Your group chat convos are all us
You just wanna  love
Soon as you enter the scene
Gucci, Fendi, McQueen
But it ain't love because she ain't up
Late nights sending you memes
Wait, gym workouts when you so stressed
Now it's all squats and meal preps
But I don't know why you still get
All up in your feelings, tell me that you leaving
Then you storm out in your slippers
Like, go talk to your bitches
'Cause I don't know what you think this is
Who's that girl and why she keep liking your pictures?

I wish it was easy to love me
I wish it was easy to love
I wish it was easy to love me
I ain't the one, I ain't the one
I wish it was easy to love me
I wish it was easy to love me babe
I wish it was easy to love me
I ain't the one, I ain't the one


I wish it was easy to love me
I wish it was easy to love
I wish it was easy to love me
I ain't the one
