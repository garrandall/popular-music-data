Lovers may come
Lovers may go
Steal your heart
And hurt you so

I find it's no disgrace
When the tears in your eyes
Roll down your eyes

What if, what if
What if I wipe your eyes
What if, what if
What if I share in your sighs

Would it be the same
Would it ease your pain
If I hurt inside, would it
Build your pride

And would you ask me
Oh, would you ask me
To please be your girl

(Come on, come on)
(Come on, come on)
Come on and ask me
(Come on, come on)
(Come on, come on)
Come on and ask me

Just because she
Broke your heart
Let me help you get
A brand new start

If I gave you my shoulder
To do all your crying on
If I stand by your side
Promise to never, never
Never leave you alone

Then would you ask me
Oh, would you ask me
To please be your girl

If I, if I wipe your eyes
If I, if I share in your sighs

Would it feel the same
Would it ease your pain
If I hurt inside
Would it build your pride

Oh, then would you ask me
Oh, would you ask me
To please be your girl

(Come on, come on)
(Come on, come on)
Come on and ask me
(Come on, come on)
(Come on, come on)
Come on and ask me...
