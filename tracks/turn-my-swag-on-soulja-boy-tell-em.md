Soulja Boy Tellem!

Turn ma swag on,
Took a look in tha mirror said wassup
Yeeeeea I'm gettin money (ohh)

Turn ma swag on,

I ain't did nuthin to em,
But count this money
And put my team on, now my
Whole clic stunnin

When I was 9 years old, I
Put it in ma head
That ima die for this gold
(Soulja Boy tellem)
Boy wassup, yeeeea
Hopped up off tha bed

Took a look in tha mirror said wassup
Yeeeeea I'm gettin money (ooh)

Hopped up off tha bed
Turn ma swag on
Took a look in tha mirror said wassup
Yeeeeea I'm gettin money (ooh)

I'm back again,
I know a lot of yall thought I
Wasn't coming back...
Yeeeeea, yeeeea
I had to prove them wrong,
Got back in the studio and
Came up with another hit
Yeeeeea, yeeeea
I told the world my story, the
World where I'm from
Souljaboy X L dot com, boy wassup
Yeeeeea, yeeeea

Now everytime you see me spit
Every time you hear me rhyme
Everytime you see me in
Your state of town
Say wassup
Yeeeeea, yeeeea

Hopped up off tha bed
Turn ma swag on
Took a look in tha mirror said wassup
Yeeeeea I'm gettin money (ooh)

Hopped up off tha bed
Turn ma swag on
Took a look in tha mirror said wassup
Yeeeeea I'm gettin money (ooh)
