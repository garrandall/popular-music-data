She walks up, velvet rope unhooks
She snaps her fingers and a drink comes
She locks you down with just one look
She's got this whole club undone

If she's on the rebound, you ain't gonna know it
Coming off a heartbreak, she ain't gonna show it
She's eyes caught, red dot, locked on me, yeah

She wants my hands on her body
She wants to burn like she's made of fire
Said, she ain't going home till we
Drink every drop of Kentucky dry
Don't even know what she'll do when she does it
Palm of her hand, I'm hers in the blink of an eye
She don't take no and I love
She gets what she wants
And I get to be what she wants tonight
And I get to be what she wants tonight

I get to catch all her secrets
Sequins bouncing off flashing lights
If she wants it then we're leaving
Get me home, park the truck, cut the tires

I get to be where she goes when she's lonely
The last door of the night she's closing
Oh, I know she could have anything but

She wants my hands on her body
She wants to burn like she's made of fire
Said she ain't going home till we
Drink every drop of Kentucky dry
Don't even know what she'll do when she does it
Palm of her hand, I'm hers in the blink of an eye
She don't take no and I love
She gets what she wants
And I get to be what she wants tonight
And I get to be what she wants tonight

And I don't know how I got to be the only thing she needs right now

She wants my hands on her body
She wants to burn like she's made of fire
Said she ain't going home till we
Drink every drop of Kentucky dry
Don't even know what she'll do when she does it
Palm of her hand, I'm hers in the blink of an eye
She don't take no and I love
She gets what she wants
And I get to be what she wants tonight
And I get to be what she wants tonight

And I get to be what she wants tonight, tonight
