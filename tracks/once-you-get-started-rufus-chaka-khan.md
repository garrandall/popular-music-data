Once you get started, oh it's hard to stop
You can't stop you just can't stop
When you get down y'all
When you get down ain't no turnin' back no
Everybody party hearty
To get back in the groove
I like the way you do it... way you do it
I like the way you move
It's a good thing
Hear a funky sound
Everybody let's get on down
You gon do it like you never done before
Hey... hey
I just want you to know that
Once you get started, oh it's hard to stop
You can't stop you just can't stop
When you get down y'all
When you get down ain't no turnin' back no
Everybody party hearty
To get right in the groove
I love the way you do it... way you do it
I like the way you move
It's the new thing
When ya know that ya getting' on down, yeah
Everybody come on y'all and get down with me
You can do it like you never done before, yeah
Once you get started, oh it's hard to stop
You can't stop you just can't stop
When you get down y'all
When you get down ain't no turnin' back no
Now that ya got down
We just wanna say
If you dig the funky, funky music
Come on and move it this way
Come on and move, come on and groove
