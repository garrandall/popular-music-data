What you gona do
When you're feelin' blue
You think you're lookin'
At some river run dry
Well, it's nothing new
Still the same old dues
There ain't no reason for asking why.


'Cause it's a power play
Just like yesterday
There ain't no second-guessing now
Well, you had your way
So what can you say
One shot is all you're allowed.

There's a catch-22
Just waitin' on you
Try talkin' your way out of this
For all those lies
There behind your eyes
I'll know it's something
I'll never miss.


'Cause it's a power play
Did you know your way
Did you burn all your bridges behind
Is there another way back
To that good old track
Or are we just wasting our time.

What you gona do
When you're feelin' blue
You think you're lookin'
At some river run dry
Well, it's nothing new
Still the same old dues
There ain't no reason for asking why.


'Cause it's a power play
Just like yesterday
There ain't no second-guessing now
Well, you had your way
So what can you say
One shot is all you're allowed.


'Cause it's a power play
Did you know your way
Did you burn all your bridges behind
Is there another way back
To that good old track
Or are we just wasting our time.


'Cause it's a power play
Just like yesterday
There ain't no second-guessing now
Well, you had your way
So what can you say
One shot is all you're allowed.


'Cause it's a power play
Did you know your way
Did you burn all your bridges behind
Is there another way back
To that good old track
Or are we just wasting our time.
