In a little town, many years ago
Lived a puppet maker who would give a puppet show
And his lifetime wish, for which he used to pray
Was to hear his puppets sing and play

In his world of dreams, he began to feel
That his little puppets, to him were very real
Every night, he dreamed that soon would come the day
He'd hear his little puppets, sing and play

My name Pancho
My name Pedro
My name Cisco
My name Jingo
Won't you listen to us as we play?

With his faith and love
He believed somewhere, someone up above
Would grant his little prayer
The miracle occurred before his ending day
The old man heard his puppets sing and play

My name Pancho
My name Pedro
My name Cisco
My name Jingo
Won't you listen to us as we play?
