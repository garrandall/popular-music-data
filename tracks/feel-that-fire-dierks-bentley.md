She wants her nails painted black
She wants the toy in the Cracker Jack
She wants to ride the bull at the rodeo
She wants to wear my shirt to bed
She wants to make every stray a pet
And drive around in my truck with no place to go

But she needs to feel that fire
The one that lets her know for sure
She's everything I want and more
Her real desire
Is to know I'd walk alone out on the wire
To make her feel that fire

She wants a cabin in the woods
She wants to stand where nobody's stood
Someday she wants a couple kids of her own
She wants to make love on a train
Some days she only wants a break
Hey she wants what she wants but man I know, I know, I know

She needs to feel that fire
The one that lets her know for sure
She's everything I want and more
Her real desire
Is to know I'd walk alone out on the wire
To make her feel that fire, yeah, feel that fire

So as long as there's a breath to take
A smile to share a prayer to pray
A chance to hold her hand and fan the flame

She's gonna feel that fire
The one that lets her know for sure
She's everything I want and more
Her real desire
Is to know I'd walk alone out on the wire
Yeah to make her feel that fire, oh, oh, oh
Feel that fire

She wants her nails painted black
She wants the toy in the Cracker Jack
She wants to ride the bull at the rodeo
