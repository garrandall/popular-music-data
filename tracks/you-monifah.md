 It's been a long time... Yeah, since I looked in a mirror... and liked what I see

 It was a hard climb... Yeah, things are much clearer... in my reality and how people see me, yeah

 Always feeling ashamed, (Hey), because of what I was told... Now I'm taking the ugly, and made it beautiful, yeah


I found me a place, where I ain't doin' nothin', but lovin' myself, and everything about me, yeah...
Said I found me a place, and it don't even matter, what nobody else thinks, 'cause I'm lovin' me, (yeah)


 It's been a long time... since I sang on a song... They said my voice was right, but my curves were all wrong

 It's such a hard time... when the media chooses... who wins or who loses, but I gotta fix what your illusions

 Oh, no, no longer feelin' the pain... I'm more than good enough... Gave my power away... But now I back and stronger


I found me a place, where I ain't doin' nothin', but lovin' myself, and everything about me, yeah...
I found me a place, and it don't even matter, what nobody else thinks, 'cause I'm lovin' me, (yeah)

 If I'm not a size 2, it don't fit you, it's okay, 
 I refuse to be dismissed because my skin is darker than yours, 
 all that power when say "You're pretty in the face", if only I could lose some weight, 
 anything you can do, I can do better, 
 made up my mind, won't stop never...


I found me a place, where I ain't doin' nothin', but lovin' myself, and everything about me, yeah...
I found me a place, and it don't even matter, what nobody else thinks, 'cause I'm lovin' me, (yeah)


Let me see you put your hands in the air if you love yourself 

'Cause I'm lovin' me 
 Me!
