Catch a rainbow
Make the rain go 'way
Hello sunshine
Ain't this one fine day

I'm connected so low I can hear the grass growin'
Under my feet
Doing some walkin' an' solitary talkin'
To folks on the street

And as they're passin', they see me laughin'
That's okay
Hello sunshine
Ain't this one fine day

Grab a sunbeam, turn that one dream on
I got the feelin' that the ceiling's gone
Nothin' wasteful about a tasteful
Walk in the sun

The puddin' in proofin' life is just groovin'
On everyone
It may be my ruin, but that's what I'm doin'
When I say
Hello sunshine
Ain't this one fine day

Ain't nothin' wasteful about a tasteful
Walk in the sun
The puddin' in proofin' life is just groovin'
On everyone
It may be my ruin, but that's what I'm doin'
When I say
Hello sunshine
Ain't this one fine
Hello sunshine
Ain't this one fine
Hello sunshine
Ain't this one fine day
