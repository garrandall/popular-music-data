It looked like a twist
It moved like a slop
And everytime I see it, boy
I nearly blow my top

She got a walk (what a walk)
(What a walk, what a walk)
Oh, what a walk (what a walk)
(What a walk, what a walk)

She gotta catch your eye
When you see her passing by
What a walk

She don't have to dance
The pony or the bop
She cross against the light
And bring the traffic to a stop

She got a walk (what a walk)
(What a walk, what a walk)
Oh, what a walk (what a walk)
(What a walk, what a walk)

She doesn't have a notion
What she doing with that motion
What a walk

Yeah, yeah
She really is a big sensation
I'm telling you, she's the most
Oh, the biggest thing to hit the nation
Anywhere from coast to coast

Oh, she wiggle to the left
She wiggle to the right
And you forget the time and place
And everything in sight

She got a walk (what a walk)
(What a walk, what a walk)
Oh, what a walk (what a walk)
(What a walk, what a walk)

No one can entertain her
Boy, there isn't any greater
What a walk

Oh, she wiggle to the left
She wiggle to the right
And you forget the time and place
And everything in sight

She got a walk (what a walk)
(What a walk, what a walk)
Yeah, what a walk (what a walk)
(What a walk, what a walk)

But if there's any doubt
What I'm talking about
It's very clear to see

That the girl, the crazy little girl
(What a crazy little girl)
Is a tiny little puppy dog
Walking with me

(What a walk, what a walk)
(What a walk) ruff, ruff
