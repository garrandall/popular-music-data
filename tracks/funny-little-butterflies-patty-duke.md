I must be growing up
I'd like to run and hide
There's something going on
I'm all mixed up inside

Tonight, he held my hand
And when our fingers touched
I felt butterflies
Funny little butterflies

I wonder if it shows
This strange new way I feel
This strange new feeling
That I simply can't conceal

Tonight, he held me tight
And all the while we danced
I felt butterflies
Funny little butterflies

I'm still a little scared
It happens much too fast
I'm still a little lost
Between what's coming
And what's past

I know it's not a dream
It's lasted much too long
Each time I close my eyes
The feeling's still so strong

Tonight, I found it nice
Just to be a girl
I feel butterflies
Funny little butterflies inside

(Those funny butterflies)
(Those funny butterflies)...
