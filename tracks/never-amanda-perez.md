(yea, OoOo OoOo OoOo)

You walked into my life, when I was down and out
Took away my pain and gave me your smile
And at the time, still lovin someone else
Not knowin'why kus they were the reason why I felt the way I felt
And then one day I realized
That you were the one for me
I was sooo blind, but baby now I see

Chorus:
And I'll never let you go, no, no, no
I love you so
And I'll get on both my knees and I'll beg you please
Would you spend the rest of your life with me?
Cause I'll never play
Wanna let you go
No, I'll never play
No, no, no ,no, no, no, no

I wish that I could turn back the hands of time
Cause if I would've knew your love was like this
Back then I would've made you mine, oh yeah
If I had to die a thousand times a day
I would do it for you, just to take
The pain that I have given you away
Cause I love you and I never want to let you go


Bridge:
I'm sorry (oh yes I am)
I'm sorry (I'm so sorry baby)

Chorus 2x

Oooooooooooo Ooooooooooo
