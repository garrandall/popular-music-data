I stand on my ground when we fight
No matter where we are
I am the sad clown with tear eyes
So happy on your own
We get some strange looks when we shout
Clowning at the bar
It seems that I've hoped
Now I found a match from my own heart

Just give me one good reason baby
One good reason now
One good reason, I should
I should hang around

I often wonder how we look
In other people's eyes
Wild lovers, explosive
And right above these eyes
She stands on her own ground when we kiss
Poisoning my mind
I bet that I found my match
To strike it up tonight

Just give me one good reason baby
One good reason now
One good reason, I should
I should hang around

One good reason baby
One good reason now
One good reason, I should
I should hang around
I should hang around
(One good reason)
