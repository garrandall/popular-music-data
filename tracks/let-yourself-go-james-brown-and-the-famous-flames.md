Hey, everybody
Let me tell the news
Hey, everybody
Let me tell the news
Hey, everybody
Let me tell the news

It ain't just soul
It ain't just soul, uh uh
It's just rhythm and
Just rhythm and blues

Looka here
Uh, uh

Hey, baby, let yourself go
Hey, baby, let yourself go

You're too sharp
You ain't too sharp, uh uh
Ain't too sharp, looka here
One more time, uh uh uh
Ain't too sharp, ain't too sharp
You're just too...
I wanna dance, I've got to prance
I wanna feel love is real
You've got to feel, touch it, got to, got to
I've got to feel, give it to me
You've got to feel, let me, uh
Uh uh, let me, let me have it
Uh, uh uh uh uh, uh uh
I've got to...got to...I've got to, uh
I've got to, uh uh, I've got to, uh uh
Let me, OH, I've got to, tell me
I've got to...
