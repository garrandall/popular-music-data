It's just like heaven
Being here with you
You're like an Angel
Too good to be true

But after all
I love you, I do
Angel Baby
My Angel Baby

When you are near me
My heart skips a beat
I can hardly stand on
My own two feet

Because I love you
I love you, I do
Angel Baby
My Angel baby

Whoo who, I love you
Whoo, I do
No one could love you
Like, I do

Wooo Whooo whoo whoo whoo
Woo Whooo Whoo

Please never leave me
Blue and alone
If you ever go
I'm sure you'll come back home

Because I love you
I love you, I do
Angel baby
My Angel baby

It's just like heaven
Being with you, dear
I could never stay
Away without you near

Because I love you
I love you, I do
Angel Baby
My Angel baby

Wooohoo I love you
Whooohoo I do
No one could love you
Like I do

Woooo whooo whooo
Woooooo whoo whoo
