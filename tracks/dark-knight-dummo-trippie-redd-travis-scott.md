Oh my God
Honorable C.N.O.T.E
Oh my God
Yeah, Big 14 know what the fuck goin' on
Aye

Hold up
Take a moment, count my guap, count my guap
All these racks bomin' in, they bomin' in (hold up)
Aye, count my guap, count my guap
Cannot stop comin' in, comin' in
Pull up in a drop top, she drop dead
I pulled up in a drop top, she drop dead
My diamonds dancing, hopscotch, they holding hands
My diamonds dancing, hopscotch, they holding hands

Yeah, hold up
I don't know what planet I'm on
I'm a king, lil bitch watch the throne
I feel like Bono, I'll chop off your arms (off your arms, yuh)
Steady causing havoc, yeah
Bitch I'm ballin' hard just like a Maverick
Money stretch long lil bitch, like elastic
Now that bitch steady calling me Mr Fantastic, yeah, ayy
Know I keep a ratchet (alright)
If you play, boy I'll turn your ass to ashes, yeah
Automatic, doo, doo, doo, doo, bitch, I'm blasting yeah
Oh put you in a casket, yeah
Money stretch long, it's elastic
I don't know what planet I'm on (I'm on Mars)
I'm a king, lil bitch watch the throne
I feel like Bono I'll chop off your arms (yuh)


Hold up
Take a moment, count my guap, count my guap (yeah)
All these racks bomin' in, they bomin' in (hold up, it's lit)
Ayy, count my guap, count my guap (straight up)
Cannot stop comin' in, comin' in (yeah)
Pull up in a drop top, she drop dead (alright)
I pulled up in a drop top, she drop dead (yeah)
My diamond's dancing, hopscotch, they holding hands (yeah)
My diamond's dancing, hopscotch, they holding hands (yeah)


Astroworld's my planet, my home (yeah)
Car's too hot, the fumes too strong (yeah, yeah, it's lit)
Mixed this cup for way too long (yeah, yeah, alright)
Add it up, don't subtract it (yeah, yeah)
Pour this eighth with me and let's get blasted (straight up)
Lambo drive like a dragon (skrrt, skrrt)
Can't fall asleep at night 'cause they attacking, yeah
I, hop in the coupe, go insane
I, disappear, go David Blaine
We, don't do the same
I, feed all my bitches the cane (white)
I, double cup to drown the pain (drank)
Like a octane (gas)
I'ma put six in the Lambo and jet to the plane (skrrt, skrrt)
Move for this chain with your elbow, I hope you got aim
Don't need no more stains, or get hot like my name (La Flame)
Yeah, hide out in the trees with the bumblebees
Please say the name three times, we gon' pop up on you
Like I'm Bloody Mary, man


Hold up
Take a moment, count my guap, count my guap
All these racks bomin' in, they bomin' in (hold up)
Aye, count my guap, count my guap
Cannot stop comin' in, comin' in
Pull up in a drop top, she drop dead
I pulled up in a drop top, she drop dead
My diamonds dancing, hopscotch, they holding hands
My diamonds dancing, hopscotch, they holding hands
Yeah
