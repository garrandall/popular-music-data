I dance around this empty house
Tear us down, throw you out
Screaming down the halls
Spinnin' all around and now we fall


Pictures framing up the past
You're taunting smirk behind the glass
This museum full of ash
Once a tickle, now a rash


This used to be our funhouse
But now it's full of evil clowns
It's time to start the countdown
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down
I'm gonna burn it down
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, fun!


Echoes knockin' on locked doors
All the laughter from before
I'd rather live out on the street
Than in this haunted memory


I've called the movers
Called the maids
We'll try to exorcise this place
Drag my mattress to the yard
Crumble, tumble, house of cards


This used to be our funhouse
But now it's full of evil clowns
It's time to start the countdown
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down
This used to be our funhouse
But now it's full of evil clowns
It's time to start the countdown
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down
I'm gonna burn it down
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, fun!


Oh
I'm crawling through the doggy door
My key don't fit my lock no more
I'll change the drapes
I'll break the plates
I'll find a new place
Burn this fucker down


Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, da, da, da, da
Do-do-do-do, do-do, do (9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do


This used to be our funhouse
But now it's full of evil clowns
It's time to start the countdown
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down
This used to be our funhouse
But now it's full of evil clowns
It's time to start the countdown
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down
I'm gonna burn it down
