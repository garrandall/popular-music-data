{And I don't believe you love me anymore} (anymore)

Lately you've been acting strange to me
Somehow it's not the way it used to be
You're doing things you never dared to do before

{And I don't believe you love me anymore} (anymore)

I've felt your love grow colder day by day
When I try to hold you close you turn away
There must be someone else you're running for

{And I don't believe you love me anymore} (anymore)

{And I don't believe you love me anymore} (anymore)

I've felt your love grow colder day by day
When I try to hold you close you turn away
There must be someone else you're running for

{And I don't believe you love me anymore} (anymore)
{I don't believe you love me anymore}
