Oh baby, you know I've waited, waited so long 
To sing...to sing this song

Whatever, whatever, babe I'll do it 
Forever and ever, yeah. yeah, yeah, yeah, 
I'll see you through it

I've got to keep you pleased in every way I can 
Gonna give you all of me, as much or you can stand 
Make love to you right now, that's all I want to do 
I know you need it boy and you know
I need it too, cause

I've found what the world is searchin' for
Here, right here my dear I don't have to look no more 
And all of my days I hoped and I prayed
For someone just like you to makes me feel the way you do

Never Never gonna give you up,
I'm never ever gonna stop
Not the way I feel about you babe
I just can't live without you 
I'm never ever gonna quit 'cause quiting just ain't my schtick 
I'm gonna lay right here with you and do all the 
things you want me to

Whatever you want, boy you got it 
And whatever you need
I don't want to see you without it

You've given me much more than words could ever say 
Oh my dear I'll be right here until my dying day 
I don't know just how to say all the things I feel
I just know that I love you so and it gives me
such a thrill 'cause

I've found what the world is lookin' for
Here, right here my dear I don't have to search no more 
And all of my days I hoped and I prayed
For someone just like you to makes me feel the way you do

Never Never gonna give you up,
I'm never ever gonna stop
Not the way I feel about you babe
I just can't live without you 
I'm never ever gonna quit 'cause quiting just ain't my schtick 
I'm gonna lay right here with you and do all the 
things you want me to

Never Never gonna give you up,
I'm never ever gonna stop
Not the way I feel about you babe
I just can't live without you 
I'm never ever gonna quit 'cause quiting just ain't my schtick 
I'm gonna lay right here with you and do all the 
things you want me to
