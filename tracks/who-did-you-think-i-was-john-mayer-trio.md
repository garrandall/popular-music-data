I got half a smile and zero shame
I got a reflection with a different name


Got a brand new blues that I can't explain


Who did you think I was?


Every mornin', when the day begins
I make up my mind, then change it back, again


I've been a shifter of the shape I'm in


Who did you think I was?


You got my number, but I always knew the score


Who did you think I was?


Am I the one who plays the quiet songs?
Or is he the one who turns the ladies on?


Will I keep shining 'til my light is gone?


Who did you think I was?


You got my number, but I always knew the score


Who did you think I was?

Here is a line that you won't understand:
I'm half of a boy, but I'm twice the man
Carry the weight of the world in the palm of my hand


Who did you think I was?
Who did you think I was?
