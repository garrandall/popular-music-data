Once again we sit in silence
After all is said and done
Only emptiness inside us
Baby, look what we've become
We can make a million promises
But we still won't change
It isn't right to stay together
When you only bring each other pain


I don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry


Too far apart to bridge the distance
But something keeps us hanging on and on
Pretending not to know the difference
Denying what we had is gone
Every moment we're together
It's just breaking me down
I know we swore it was forever
But it hurts too much to stay around


I don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry, no, no


All the magic's gone
There's just a shadow of a memory
Something just went wrong
We can't go on make-believing
On make-believing


'Cause I don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)
Said I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry, cry
I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry
