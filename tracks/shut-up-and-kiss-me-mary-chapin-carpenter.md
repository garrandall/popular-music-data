Don't mean to get a little forward with you, don't mean to get ahead of where we are
Don't mean to act a little nervous around you, I'm just a little nervous about my heart 'cause
It's been awhile since I felt this feeling that everything that you do gives me
It's been so long since somebody whispered
Shut up and kiss me

Didn't expect to be in this position, didn't expect to have to rise above
My reputation for cynicism, I've been a jaded lady when it comes to love but
Oh baby just to feel this feeling that everything that you do gives me
It's been too long since somebody whispered
Shut up and kiss me

There's something about the silent type attracting me to you
All business baby none of the hype
That no talker can live up to

Come closer baby I can't hear you, just another whisper if you please
Don't worry 'bout the details darlin', you've got the kind of mind I love to read
Talk is cheap and baby time's expensive, so why waste another minute more
Life's too short to be so apprehensive, love's as much the symptom darlin' as the cure
Oh baby when I feel this feeling, it's like genuine voodoo hits me
It's been too long since somebody whispered...
Oh baby I can feel this feeling that everything that you do gives me
It's been too long since somebody whispered
Shut up and kiss me
Shut up and kiss me
