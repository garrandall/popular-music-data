Verse 1
Well, I can wash out forty-four pairs of socks
And hang them  on the line
I can starch and iron two dozen shirts
Before you can count from one to nine
I can scoop up a great big dipper
Full of lard from the drippin's can
Throw it in the skillet, do my shopping
And be back before it melts in the pan

Chorus
Cause I'm a woman
W-O-M-A-N
Let me tell you again
I'm a woman
W-O-M-A-N

Verse 2
Well, I can rub and scrub till this house
Shines just like a dime
Feed the baby, grease the car and
Powder my nose  at the same time
I can get all dressed up
Go out and swing till five a.m. and then
Jump in bed at five, get up at six
And start all over again

Chorus
Cause I'm a woman
W-O-M-A-N
Let me tell you again
I'm a woman
W-O-M-A-N

Verse 3
If you come to me sick, you know
I'm gonna make you well
If you come to me all hexed up
You know I'm gonna break the spell
If you come to me hungry
You know I'll feed you full o' my grits
If it's lovin' you want, I can kiss
And give you the shiverin fits

Verse 4
I got a twenty dollar gold piece says
There ain't nothin I can't do
I can make a dress out of a feed bag
And make a man out of you

Chorus
Cause I'm a woman
W-O-M-A-N
Let me tell you again
I'm a woman
W-O-M-A-N
And that's all
That's all

Outro
What more do you want
What more do you need
I'm a woman
Satisfaction guaranteed
