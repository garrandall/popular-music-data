Look at how I do it with the Babouche
Under 16, street Babouche
Kimono on a suit, lookin' like a cape
So ahead of my time, I should probably wait
Lady on my arm, lady on her own
Flip a condom wit' the lucky charm
Takin' out your whole team like I'm 
They ain't got no D like a strap-on
Yeah, they probably got a hundred failures
Yeah, I probably got a hundred tailors
Chiefin' like I'm Bobby and The Wailers
I don't force it, I finesse it
 at the hood at dressers
I be blessed
You can tell a lie from appearance
You can really spot what you fearin'
I heard Morgan Freeman got a hearing
See, I never trusted that earring

Ay, uncle, tell 'em what they're talkin' 'bout
Ooh, you slimy too, you sleazy, ooh
Auntie, tell me what the message is
Uh, in the midst of all, I swank on you
Midst of all, I swank on you
In the midst of all, I swank on you (Oh yeah)
Uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
In the midst of all, I swank on you

Yeah, ya heard the accent, yeah, I get it from the east
Flow ridiculous so they find it so hard to beat
I be dancin' on the beat like I got two left feet
And I shoot at anything, so don't you think it's sweet (Think it's sweet)
Fuckin' different flavours, she be askin' "Who the neighbours?"
Rappers always copy me, they owe a hundred favours
All my partners talkin' crazy like they wanna date ya
And my favourite bitch in Cali really love The Raiders
I don't need nobody, I just need my wealth
And my baby mama, and my mental health
Keep it gangster, twistin' fingers, shit, that get you dealt
And I got a couple notches, I don't need no belt
 know we better than the rest
I don't need no rest, and I'll never wear no vest
If you got a problem, you should share it with your chest
And if I ever get her number, she gon' be undressed, huh

Ay, uncle, tell 'em what they're talkin' 'bout
Ooh, you slimy too, you sleazy, ooh
Auntie, tell me what the message is
Uh, in the midst of all, I swank on you
Midst of all, I swank on you
In the midst of all, I swank on you (Oh yeah)
Uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
In the midst of all, I swank on you
