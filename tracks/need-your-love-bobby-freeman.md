Oh, oh, oh...
Won't you give your love to me
I've been waiting so patiently
Because I need your love so bad
Mmm, I come to thee
On my bending knees
Because I need your love so bad
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm gonna tell you
Just how I feel
I'm gonna tell you
That this love is real
Baby, baby, baby
You don't understand
That I want to be your lover man
Oh, say you'll give your love to me
I've been waiting so patiently
Because I need your love so bad
Mmm, so bad
Oh, oh, oh, oh, so bad
Oh, so bad, so bad
