Let's talk of peace,
Sounds so cliche
A novelty, catch phrase of the day
Middle, index,
Sign of the time
Just as complex,
As water to...

Someone said give peace a chance
And, that's all that we're saying
While we're sitting on the fence
Pretending,
Our hearts are in the right place
But, your face
Shows a trace of,

Hypocrisy,
Don't tread on me,
Now you can see

MAKE LOVE NOT WAR, SOUNDS SO ABSURD, TO ME
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO SAY THESE WORDS, LIGHTLY
OR ELSE OUR WORLD, WILL TRULY, REST IN PEACE

Let's not pretend,
to justify
Rather amend,
Where treasures lie
Straight through the heart,
Peace can be found
That's where you start,
Not all around

Someone said give peace a chance
And, that's all that we're saying
While we're sitting on the fence
Pretending,
Our hearts are in the right place
But, your face
Shows a trace of,

Hypocrisy,
Don't tread on me, boy
Now you can see
