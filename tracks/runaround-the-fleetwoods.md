I'll never be the one to part
You've found a place here in my heart
Go have your fun (I'll have my fun)
Runaround

I'll never leave you
I'm forever bound
The streets are noisy
I'm all alone
I sit and wait, dear, for you to phone
Go have your fun (I'll have my fun)
Go have your fun
Runaround

I've waited so long it seems
You're running out of my dreams
Maybe a new love you've found
Settle down
Runaround

Oh oh oohohoh
Oh oh oohohoh
Oh oh oohohoh
Oh oh oohohoh

Go have your fun (I'll have my fun)
Go have your fun
Runaroud

I've waited so long it seems
You're running out of my dreams
Maybe a new love you've found
Settle down
Runaround

I'll never be the one to part
You've found a place here in my heart
Go have your fun (I'll have my fun)
Go have your fun
Runaround
