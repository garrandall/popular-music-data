How many times
Have you heard someone say
If I had his money
I would do things my way
But little they know
That it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten
With a satisfied mind
Once I was winning
In fortune and fame
Everything that I dreamed for
To get a start in life's game
But suddenly it happened
(Oh, so suddenly)
I lost every dime
(Oh, so suddenly)
But I'm richer by far
With a satisfied mind
'Cause money can't buy back
Your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely
Or a love that's grown cold
Why, the wealthiest person
Is a poor man at times
Compared to the man
With a satisfied mind
Don't you know you can't buy back
Your youth when you're old
Not a friend when you're lonely
And what about that love
That love you know that's grown cold
Now you take the wealthiest person
He ain't nothing but a poor man at times
Compared to the man
With a satisfied mind
