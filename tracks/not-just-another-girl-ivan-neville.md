The place was jammed, the music loud
I could see her face standing out in the crowd as she winked at me
Feeling good I didn't care
All I could see was her standing there
See the crowd got up, the band was playing
And in my mind I could hear her saying, I love you

She could have been from anywhere
She could have had most anyone
I bet the girls in another world
Not just another girl

When I met her folks there was no surprise
Had her old mans ways and her mothers eyes
Silver spoons, she had everything
She'd leave it all just to hear me sing

I say, the crowd got up, the band was playing
And in my mind I could hear her saying, I love you

She could have been from anywhere
She could have had most anything
I bet the girls in another world
Not just another girl

I gotta find a way inside her lovely world
I gotta see the day when I can really be sure shell be my girl

Her royal blood didn't mean a thing Even though I first thought I might be a king
I say, the crowd got up, the band was playing
And in my mind, I could hear her saying, I love you

She could have been from anywhere
She could have had most anyone
I think the girls in another world
Not just another girl

She could have been from anywhere
Place was jammed, music loud
She could have had most anything
I could see her face
I bet the girls in another world
Hey, woman when you getting home tonight?
Not just another girl
