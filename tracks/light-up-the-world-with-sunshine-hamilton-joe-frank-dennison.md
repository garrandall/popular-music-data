Light up the world with sunshine
Turn on a brand new day
Give a little love to someone
Take a little hate away

Hold on to one another
Put out your helping hand
Light up the world with sunshine
Shine it on a new born day

Walking close together
Feeling like I do
If only everybody
Could love each other too

We should all be neighbors
Joining hand in hand
Peace with one another
Tryin to build up a better land

We could Light up the world with sunshine
Turn it on a brand new day
Give a little love to someone
Take a little hate away

Hold on to one another
Put out your helping hand
Light up the world with sunshine
Shine it on a new born day

If we could see tomorrow
Through a crystal ball
Use a little magic
Try to change it all
All the nation's children
Sitting by the sun
We're learning it together
So come on everyone

And we can Light up the world with sunshine
Turn it on a brand new day
Give a little love to someone
Take a little hate away

Hold on to one another
Put out your helping hand
Light up the world with sunshine
Shine it on a new born day

Light up the world with sunshine
Turn it on a brand new day
Give a little love to someone
Take a little hate away
