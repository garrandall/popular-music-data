If you ask me, I'm ready...


Ugh, Tez keeps tellin' me he just turned 30
Havin' dreams of bein' single forever, he's gettin' worried
And I'm scared too, 'cause I'm in the same boat
Good women are rare too, none of them have came close
Me I haven't changed much, you know how I play it
Better safe than sorry
'Stead of searchin' for substance at every single party
Baby, bein' part of this life
I feel like I'm bound to end up with somebody that's been with everybody
I need you to rescue me from my destiny
I'm tryna live right and give you whatever's left of me (yeah)
'Cause you know life is what we make it
And a chance is like a picture, it'd be nice if you just take it
Or let me take it for you, I'm just down to ride
Or we can roll around the city 'til you finally decide
I've got more than a thing for you, tattoo and an ink for you
Right over my heart, girl, I'll do the unthinkable


Moment of honesty
Someone's gotta take the lead tonight
Who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here
And tell you all that comes to me
If you have somethin' to say
You should say it right now
You should say it right now
You ready?


You give me a feelin' that I've never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
I deserve it, I think I deserve it, let it go
It's becoming somethin' that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it
I can't take it


I was wonderin', maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)


I know you once said to me
"This is exactly how it should feel when it's meant to be"
Time is only wastin', so why wait for eventually?
If we gon' do somethin' 'bout it
We should do it right now
We should do it right now
Baby, uh


You give me a feelin' that I've never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
I deserve it, I know I deserve it, let it go
It's becoming somethin' that's impossible to ignore
It is what we make it


I was wonderin', maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful? Either way, I'm sayin'...
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)


Yeah, yeah
Sing...
Why give up before we try?
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away (fly away)
I can't say I came prepared
I'm suspended in the air
Won't you come be in the sky with me?


I was wonderin', maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful? Either way, I'm sayin'...
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready, I'm ready)
