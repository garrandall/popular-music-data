I'll be alone each and every night
While you're away, don't forget to write

See you in September
See you when the summer's through
If you are saying goodbye at the station
Summer vacation is taking you away

Have a good time but remember
There is danger in the summer moon above
Will I see you in September
Or lose you to a summer love?

Counting the days 'til I'll be with you
Counting the hours and the minutes too

Have a good time but remember
There is danger in the summer moon above
Will I see you in September
Or lose you to a summer love?
