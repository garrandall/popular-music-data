Run, running all the time
Running to the future
With you right by my side
Me, I’m the one you chose
Out of all the people
You wanted me the most
And I’m so sorry that I’ve fallen
Help me up, let’s keep on running
Don’t let me fall out of love


Running, running, as fast as we can
Do you think we’ll make it?
We’re running, keep holding my hand
So we don’t get separated


Be, be the one I need
Be the one I trust most
Don’t stop inspiring me
Sometimes it’s hard to keep on running
We work so much to keep it going
Don’t make me want to give up


Running, running, as fast as we can
Do you think we’ll make it?
We’re running, keep holding my hand
So we don’t get separated


Running as fast as we can
I really hope we make it
We’re running as fast as we can
I really hope we make it
We’re running, keep holding my hand
So we don’t get separated

The future…


Running, running, as fast as we can
Do you think we’ll make it?
We’re running, keep holding my hand
So we don’t get separated


Running as fast as we can
I really hope we make it
We’re running, running, keep holding my hand
So we don’t get separated
