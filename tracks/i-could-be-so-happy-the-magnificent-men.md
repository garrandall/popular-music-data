Ohh, I'm here!
So open up the door for me
(Who is it?)
It's Hopsin
I'm Here
So open up the door for me
Hurry up and let me in
(Na Na Na Na Na)
Give me my dinner
(Na Na Na Na Na)
Then pass me the dessert

Yo, H-izzo P
Stepped in the dizzo
With a mean mug and a magnificent flizzo
I'm gotta get my swag on nigga ye know
I'm tryna leave the club with a freaky ass HOEEEE!
My penis is all I'm feenin to give her
Hopsin is sicker than a nigga who sobbin
From hiccups and vomit his liver (what?)
You wanna blow up?
Stop gobblin liquor and probly consider
Plottin some shit up to get popular quicker
Phonies get to many plays on the station
And leave me assed out of a deal
While they on vacation
Shit I'll leave these rappers face on the pavement!
This games filled with more whack niggas
Then a slave owners basement
But I'm a freth of bresh air
I mean a breath of fresh air
Mcs are next to catch hell
I leave em wrecked and then scared
Cause that's just what I do
I'm the lyrical bugaboo
Wait on me for a subsitute
I be tearing shit up so move!

Ohh, I'm here!
So open up the door for me
(Who is it?)
It's Hopsin
I'm Here
So open up the door for me
Hurry up and let me in
(Na Na Na Na Na)
Give me my dinner
(Na Na Na Na Na)
Then pass me the dessert

Hey shorty, if I buy you a 40
You think that you can gimme some tang?
I'm feelin horny, or we can have an orgy
With you and your friends, Ill be the man
Have a nigga yellin out, YEAH!
My label tryna make me switch the flow
Just because Oprah,
Don't want me sayin bitch no more
I'm like Oprah why you doin this?
Come on this is Ludacris
That just hypes my ass up even more
To call YOU a bitch!
This is my life, and this is my urge
This is my mic, and these are my words
You can't stop Hopsin
Forget it, it's not poppin
I kick the shit that niggas love
When they hot boxin
Right when you was bout to retire
From listenin rap music,
I reversered and turned you back to it
It was a close call
I was even thinkin all hope was lost
But most of all!
Be happy

Ohh, I'm here!
So open up the door for me
(Who is it?)
It's Hopsin
I'm Here
So open up the door for me
Hurry up and let me in
(Na Na Na Na Na)
Give me my dinner
(Na Na Na Na Na)
Then pass me the dessert

I go to rap concerts, and post in the back
Don't even clap,
I'm knowin that to show or be whack
After performin
They be lookin like they supposed to get dap
I'm like,
Man you got murdered by your openin act!
Get outta here!
You ain't fuckin with what I brought to the table
You just a tax write-off for your label
You outside flossin you Range Rove
Hoes eyeballin your bankroll
Till you floppin all the money back
Am I watchin the same show?
I think so
I'm the invincible, unpredictable
Mr. Ripper flow
Yes it's pitiful, gimme some nipples to nibble on
Lyrical general, suck on my genitals
Fore you get shitted on
Understand me or ye never gon get along
He best be, the hottest since the PS3
Straight out the W.E.S.T
Of course!
What other rappers you know
Reppin it iller?
You other nigggas pretty hot
But I'm a definite killer

Ohh, I'm here!
So open up the door for me
(Who is it?)
It's Hopsin
I'm Here
So open up the door for me
Hurry up and let me in
(Na Na Na Na Na)
Give me my dinner
(Na Na Na Na Na)
Then pass me the dessert


Hopsin! 
Hopsin!
