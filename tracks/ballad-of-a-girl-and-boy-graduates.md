This is the story of a girl and a boy
Whose hearts were once filled with love and with joy
Though they were young their hearts always knew
Theirs was a love, a love which was true

Then one day, well she went away
Well her love and her hopes, they were there to stay
They knew that some day she would return
Theirs was a love, a love which would burn

This was a story of a girl and a boy
Whose hearts were once filled with love and with joy
And now they live a happy life
'Cause they are joined as man and...
