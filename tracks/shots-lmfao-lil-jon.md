If you not drunk ladies & gentlemen
Get ready to get fucked up
Let's do it, Ha Ha
LMFAO
You know what
Lil Jon
Yeah
All of the alcoholics
Where you at
Let's go

When I walk in the club
All eyes on me
I'm with the party rock crew
All drinks are free
We like ciroc
We love patrone
We came to party rock
Everybody it's on
Shots shots shots shots shots shots
Shots shots shots shots shots
Shots shots shots shots shots
Everybody 
The ladies love us
When we pour shots
They need an excuse
To suck our cocks
We came to get crunk
How 'bout you?
Bottles up
Let's go round two
Shots shots shots shots shots shots
Shots shots shots shots shots
Shots shots shots shots shots
Everybody 
If you ain't getting drunk get the fuck out the club
If you ain't takin' shots get the fuck out the club
If you ain't come to party get the fuck out the club
Now where my alcoholics let me see ya hands up
What you drinkin on?
Jaegerbombs
Lemondrops
Buttery Nipples
Jello Shots
Kamikaze
Three Wise Men
Fuck all that shit
Get me some Gin

Patrone's on the rocks and I'm ready for some shots
The women come around everytime I'm pourin' shots
Their panties hit the ground everytime I give em shots
So cups in the air, everybody let's take shots.
If you feelin' drunk put ya hands in the air
And If you tryin' to fuck put ya hands in the air
Now say "I'm fucked up" (I'm fucked up)
I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up)
I'm tryna fuck (I'm tryna fuck)
I'm tryna fuck (I'm tryna fuck)
Shots
Patrone's on the rocks and I'm ready for some shots
The women come around everytime I'm pourin' shots
Their panties hit the ground everytime I give em shots
So cups in the air, everybody let's take shots.
I'm fucked up
La dad a da
La dad a dad a da
