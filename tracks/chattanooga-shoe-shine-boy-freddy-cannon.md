Have you ever passed the corner of Fourth and Grand
Where a little ball of rhythm has a shoe shine stand?
People gather round and they clap their hands

He's a great big bundle of joy
He pops the boogie woogie rag
The Chattanooga shoe shine boy

Yeah, he charges you a nickel just to shine one shoe
He makes the oldest kind of leather look like new
You feel as though you wanna dance when he gets through

He's a great big bundle of joy
He pops the boogie woogie rag
The Chattanooga shoe shine boy

It's a wonder that the rag don't tear
The way he makes it pop
You ought to see him fan the air
With his hoppity hippity
Hoppity hippity hop hop hop

He opens up for business when the clock strikes nine
He likes to get 'em early when they're feelin' fine
Everybody gets a little rise and shine

With the great big bundle of joy
He pops the boogie woogie rag
The Chattanooga shoe shine boy

Yeah, whoa
Whoa, do it, do it, do it

It's a wonder that the rag don't tear
The way he makes it pop
You ought to see him fan the air
With his hoppity hippity
Hippity hippity hop hop hop

He opens up for business when the clock strikes nine
He likes to get 'em early when they're feelin' fine
Everybody gets a little rise and shine

With the great big bundle of joy
He pops the boogie woogie rag
The Chattanooga shoe shine boy

Yeah, whoa
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
