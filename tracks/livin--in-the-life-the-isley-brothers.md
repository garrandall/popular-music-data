Somebody said, I was living in the life
Somebody told me, I was living in the life
Think that you might know, you find that you're really wrong
My pictures come and go but my living has got to go on

And if you think it's easy it's only 'cause
You ain't me and I ain't you
Check out the difference between the two

Somebody said, it was easy in my life
Somebody told me, I had made it in my life
Try to understand my determination win
You can't only stand on the outside looking in

And if you think it's easy it's only 'cause
You ain't me and I ain't you
Check out the difference between the two

Somebody said, I was living in the life
Somebody told me, I was living in the life
Try to understand my determination win
You can't only stand on the outside looking in

You ain't me and I ain't you
That's the horrible difference between the two
