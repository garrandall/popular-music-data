Really thought that I could live without you
Really thought that I could make it on my own
Sent you away yeah I said I didn't need you
I let you go I let you go I let you go
Now I'm so lost without you
Now you're not here and now I know


Lonely is the night when I'm not with you
Lonely is the night ain't no light shining through
Till you're in my arms till you're here by my side
Lonely am I

Never thought that I that I would need you
Never thought that I that I'd be missing you
Gotta get you back
I just got to find a way now
To let you know to let you know to let you know
That I'm so lost without you
And now this world it ain't just right



I can make it through the day
I can fake it okay
I just smile and pretend
And I tell myself I'll be alright

But lonely is the night
Lonely is the night
