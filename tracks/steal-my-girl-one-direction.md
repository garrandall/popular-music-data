She's been my queen since we were sixteen
We want the same things, we dream the same dreams, alright, alright
I got it all 'cause she is the one
Her mum calls me love, her dad calls me son, alright, alright


I know, I know, I know for sure


Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Na na na na na na na
Oh yeah
Na na na na na na na
Alright
Na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na
She belongs to me


Kisses like cream, her walk is so mean
And every jaw drops when she's in those jeans, alright, alright
I don't exist, if I don't have her
The sun doesn't shine, the world doesn't turn, alright, alright


But I know, I know, I know for sure


Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Na na na na na na na
Oh yeah
Na na na na na na na
Alright
Na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na


She know, she knows
That I never let her down before
Oh, she know, she knows
That I'm never gonna let another take her love from me now


Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Everybody wanna take her love away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Well, find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Na na na na na na na, oh yeah
Oh yeah, alright yeah
Na na na na na na na
Alright
Na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na
She belongs to me
