Told me that you loved me
Said that your love was true
How in the world can love you me, baby
While loving my best friend, too?
It ain't no good, it ain't no good


Oh, it ain't no good
No good, no good, no good


You ain't got no best friend
That is plain to see
I ain't never try to make love to him
He tried to make love to me
Now, that ain't no good, that ain't no good


Yeah, it ain't no good
Yeah, it ain't no good
Look-a hear, baby


Early in the morning I think about you
Late at night, I think about you, too
We were meant for each other
I'm in love with you (Uh huh!)
Ah, that's some good (I know it's good!)
That's really some good (Really, really some good)


Oh, that's really some good (Some good, oh)
Really, really some good (Really, really some good)
Really, really some good (Really, really some good)
You know that's good! (You know that's good)
You know that's good! (You know that's good)
Oh! (Oh, yeah!)
Oh! (Oh, yeah!)
Oh! (Oh, yeah!)
Oh, baby! (Really, really some good)
Really, really some good (Really, really some good)
You know that's good! (Yeah...)
You know that's good! (Yeah...)
