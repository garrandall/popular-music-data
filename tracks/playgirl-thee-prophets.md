PLAYGIRL
THEE PROPHETS

Playgirl everybody's knowing but me
Stray girl you're making it very plain
Running around on me
Turning out to be
Such a playgirl
You're not the same girl
Playgirl I used to be nothing but wine
But hey girl you had to go and have your fun
Oh what took over you
What did you go and do
You're such a playgirl
Oh what a shame girl
Someday you'll come running back to me
When you find how lonely it can be
To be a playgirl
You're such a playgirl
Playgirl everybody's knowing but me
But hey girl you know I love you just the same
Yeah someday you will see
How lonely it can be
To be a playgirl
And you'll come back to me, playgirl
And you'll come back to me, playgirl
And you'll come back to me, playgirl
