I never wanted another
Come over to me and discover
How I want to be near you
And you need to be far away
You always seem to make me feel at home
Hey you

People like
I never knew, I never knew, I never knew why
You make me wanna cry
I never knew, I never knew, I never knew why
Forever live and die

I look at all of the people
Doing it over and over
You never get any older
I wish that you could be here
I look at you and I
Make the same mistakes
Hey you

People like
I never knew, I never knew, I never knew why
You make me wanna cry
I never knew, I never knew, I never knew why
Forever Live and Die

I never knew, I never knew, I never knew why
You make me wanna cry
I never knew, I never knew, I never knew why
Forever Live and Die
