Today I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

Sombody else stood by your side
And he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
Then suddenly I got that old time feeling
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Still in love with you

Today I passed you on the street
Today I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

Sombody else stood by your side
Sombody else stood by your side
And he looked so satisfied
And you know he looked so satisfied
I can' help it if I'm still in love with you

It hurts to know another's lips will kiss you
And hold you just the way I used to do
Ohh heaven only knows how much I miss
How much that I miss yea
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Still in love with you
