Hey, little girl

Sun is shining in your hair

Hey, little girl
Don't you move
Hey, my heart and l approve

Whoa, whoa, whoa

Shine your love on me
Shine your sunshine
By the stars above you
I love you, truly love you

Hey, little girl
Hold me tight
Fall in love
On a summer night

Hey, let me
Walk you by the sea
What's good for you

And I just wanna tell you
That you're super fine
Whoa-oh

I do believe it's you that
Makes the sun to shine
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh

Hey, little girl
Let it show
Want the whole wide world to know

Let it show
So they can see
Just bow easy
Love can be, yeah

You're my sunshine
You 're my sunshine
Don't you know I love you?
(Girl, I love you)
Love you, shine
Your love on me

Ooo

And l love you, oh

Ooo
You're my sunshine
Shine, shine, shine, shine
You're my sunshine

Don't you know I love you
Love you, shine your love on me
Sunshine, by the stars above you
L love you, truly love you

Sunshine, sunshine
