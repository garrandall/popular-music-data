Did you forget
That I was even alive?
Did you forget
Everything we ever had?
Did you forget?
Did you forget
About me?
Ooohh 




Don't surrender, surrender, surrender
Please remember, remember December
We were so in love back then
Are you listening
To what they say
Don't go that way
Remember, remember, remember




I got no excuses
For all of these goodbyes
Call me when it's over
'Cause I'm dying inside


Wake me when the shakes are gone
And the cold sweats disappear
Call me when it's over
And myself has reappeared


I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I do it every, every, every time
It's only when I'm lonely


Sometimes I just wanna cave and I don't wanna fight
I try and I try and I try and I try and I try
Just hold me, I'm lonely




Oh, tell me you love me
I need someone on days like this, I do
On days like this


Oh, tell me you love me
I need someone on days like this, I do
On days like this
Oh, can you hear my heart say




Stone cold
Stone cold
You see me standing
But I'm dyin' on the floor
Stone cold
Baby
You know I try to feel
Happy for you


Know that I am
Even if I can't understand
I'll take the pain
Give me the truth
Me and my heart
We'll make it through


If happy is her
I'm happy for you




Now I've got thicker skin
I'm a warrior
I'm stronger than I've ever been


And my armor, is made of steel
You can't get in, I'm a warrior
And you can never hurt me again




Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper




You did your best or did you?
Sometimes I think I hate you (I hate you)
I'm sorry, dad, for feelin' this
I can't believe I'm sayin' it
I know you were a troubled man (a troubled man)
I know you never got the chance
To be yourself, to be your best
I hope that Heaven's given you


A second chance
