Skies are crying, I am watching
Catching tear drops in my hands
Only silence as it's ending
Like we never had a chance
Do you have to make me feel like there's nothing left of me?


You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper


As the smoke clears
I awaken and untangle you from me
Would it make you feel better to watch me while I bleed?
All my windows still are broken, but I'm standing on my feet


You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper


Go run, run, run
I'm gonna stay right here
Watch you disappear
Yeah, oh
Go run, run, run
Yeah, it's a long way down
But I am closer to the clouds up here


You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper, oh oh
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
