The time has come for us to stop messin' around
'Cause don't you know that I like havin' you around
In my life
Oh, baby

So many times I want to hold you, oh, so near
I want to say I love you softly in your ear
Oh, baby
Don't keep running

My heart is yearning for your love
'Cause my heart is yearning for your love

You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life
I need to have you as my lover and my wife
Oh, baby
Be my lover

So many times I need to have you by my side
To be my friend, my lover and my guide
Oh, baby
Don't keep runnin'

My heart is yearning for your love
My heart is yearning for your love

My heart is yearning for you
Let me inside your love
Whoa...my heart is yearning for you
Let me inside your love
Your only

(Keep runnin')

(Keep runnin')
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life
(Keep runnin')
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life

(Keep on runnin')
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life
(Keep runnin')
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life

Oh, girl

(Keep runnin')
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life

(Keep runnin')
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life

(Keep on runnin')
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life
(Keep runnin')
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life

(Keep runnin')
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life
(Keep runnin')
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life

(Keep on runnin')
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life
(Keep runnin')
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life

(Keep on runnin')
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life
(Keep runnin')
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life

(Keep on runnin')
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life
(Keep runnin')
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life
