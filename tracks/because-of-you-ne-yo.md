Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh


Want to, but I can’t help it, I love the way it feels
It’s got me stuck between my fantasy and what is real
I need it when I want it, I want it when I don’t
Tell myself I’ll stop everyday, knowin’ that I won't
I got a problem and I don’t know what to do about it
Even if I did, I don’t know if I would quit but I doubt it
I’m taken by the thought of it


And I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction
I’m so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it


And it’s all because of you (All because of you)
And it’s all because of you (All because of you)
And it’s all because of you (All because of you)
And it’s all because
Never get enough
She’s the sweetest drug


Oh-oh-oh
Think of it every second, I can't get nothing done
Only concern is the next time I’m gon' get me some
Know I should stay away from, 'cause it's no good for me
I try and try, but my obsession won't let me leave
I got a problem and I don’t know what to do about it
Oh, even if I did, I don’t know if I would quit but I doubt it
I’m taken by the thought of it, hey


And I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction
I’m so strung out on you (Strung out on you)
I can barely move but I like it (I like it)


And it’s all because of you (Oh, all because of you)
And it’s all because of you (All because of you)
And it’s all because of you (All because of you)
And it’s all because
Never get enough (Never get enough)
She’s the sweetest drug


Oh-oh-oh
Ain’t no doubt (No doubt, hey), so strung out (Strung out)
Ain’t no doubt (There's ain't no grain of doubt, oh), so strung out (Hey)
Over you, over you (You), over you (You)
Oh-oh-oh
Because of you
And it’s all because of you
Never get enough
She’s the sweetest drug


And I know this much is true
Baby, you (Baby, you, you, you) have become my addiction (My addiction)
I’m so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it (Oh I like it, yeah)


And it’s all because of you (All because of you)
And it’s all because of you (All because of you)
And it’s all because of you (All because of you)
And it’s all because
Never get enough (Oh never get enough)
She’s the sweetest drug


She's the sweetest drug
