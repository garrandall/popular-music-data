I see them coming, yeah
They try to bring me down, but I won't stop (No!)
They want me in the ground, but I won't stop (No!)
âTil I'm gone man, I won't stop (No!) No
I, I see them coming, coming
They try to bring me down, but I won't stop (No!)
They want me in the ground, but I won't stop (No!)
Until I'm dead man, I won't stop (No!) No


Yeah, I think they mad 'cause I'm driving in the fast lane
But I've been grindin' for years, ask hype game
It's funny how stuff doesn't change
From sleepin' in the car to coppin' me that Range
I'm all world star
And all them other blogs
All them haters hatin' cause I am a heart throb
But do I want it all?
All the negativity is not gonna get rid of me
I'm here to make history
I'm speakin' it real
Back track to the days when I ain't have me a deal, yeah
So I'ma show the world that I'm ill
Every beat that I get on best believe I'ma kill
So you can have all the jewelry
Have all the cars
Have all the fame
Have all the broads
You can have the fact that I'm a star
Just so you can listen to these bars


I see them coming. Yeah
They try to bring me down, but I won't stop (No!)
They want me in the ground, but I won't stop (No!)
Until I'm dead, man, I won't stop (No!) No
I, I see them coming, coming
They try to bring me down, but I won't stop (No!)
They want me in the ground, but I won't stop (No!)
Until I'm dead man, I won't stop. (No!) No

Yeah, they talk. Yeah, they talk
They don't walk the walk I walk
I won't stop, 'til I drop
Until then I reach the top
I'ma rock to where I need to be
Walk the path of destiny
Definitely been neglected, but God is always testin' me
Rest in peace to all the men that died that were protecting me
Objectively, I need to tell you what just gets the best of me
Essentially, people in this world just wanna let it be
A lot of men ain't different though, just let it be. Set it free
Never be scared to make change, effectively
Always look at things from different ways, perspectively
Every person in this world can do good
I just want this message understood
Alright... Stop!
Everybody's gotta listen make the decision to envision a better place with no division
Religion. Everybody needs a mission
Haters need to stop it, just listen


I see them coming, yeah
They try to bring me down, but I won't stop (No!)
They want me in the ground, but I won't stop (No!)
âTil I'm gone man, I won't stop (No!) No


I, I see them coming, coming
They try to bring me down, but I won't stop (No!)
They want me in the ground, but I won't stop (No!)
Until I'm dead man, I won't stop (No!) No
