In Hawaii there's a place known as Waimea Bay
Where the best surfers in the world come to stay
And ride the wild surf they come to try
To conquer those waves some 30 feet high

Ride, ride, ride the wild surf
Ride, ride, ride the wild surf
Ride, ride, ride the wild surf
Gotta take that one last ride

Surf fever brings them here to meet the test
And hanging round the beach you'll see the best
They're waxed up and ready just waiting for
The surf to build up on the northern shore

Ride, ride, ride the wild surf
Ride, ride, ride the wild surf
Ride, ride, ride the wild surf
Gotta take that one last ride

Lined up and waiting for that next big set outside
Nothing can stop it 'cause you've just gotta ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
The heavies at the pipeline are okay
But they can't match the savage surf at Waimea Bay
It takes a lot of skill and courage unknown
To catch the last wave and ride it in alone

Ride ride ride the wild surf
Ride ride ride the wild surf
Ride ride ride the wild surf
Gotta take that one last
Gotta take that one last ride

Ride, ride, ride the wild surf
Ride, ride, ride the wild surf
Ride, ride, ride the wild surf
Gotta take that one last ride
