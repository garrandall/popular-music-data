Like sailin' on a sailin' ship to nowhere
Love took over my heart like an ocean breeze
As seagulls fly I knew that I was losin'
Love was washed away with the driftin' tide

Oh it's a dirty old shame
When all you get from love is a love song
That's got you layin' up nights just waitin'
for the music to start
It's such a dirty old shame when you got to
take the blame for a love song
Because the best love songs are written

with a broken heart

And now the tears in my eyes are ever blinding
The future that lies before me I cannot see
Although tomorrow I know the sun is rising
Lighting up the world for everyone, but not for me
