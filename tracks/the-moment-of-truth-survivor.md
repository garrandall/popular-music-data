When you're alone you ask yourself
What are you searching for
Deep in the night a dream is born
One that you can't ignore
If you think you can find the passion
And you're ready to take a chance
If you really believe you can make it
Then the power is in your own hands

It's the moment of truth
You're giving it all
Standing alone, willing to fall
If you can do it
Get up and prove it
Get up and show them who you are
It's the moment of truth
It's all on the line
This is the place
This is the time
Waited forever, it's now or it's never
Nothing can stop you now

Once in your life you make a choice
Ready to risk it all
Deep in your soul you hear a voice
Answering to the call
Though yea know that it won't be easy
It's a promise you make for love
For the people that keep believing
And the one that you're thinking of

It's the moment of truth
You're giving it all
Standing alone, willing to fall
If you can do it
Get up and prove it
Get up and show them who you are
It's the moment of truth
It's all on the line
This is the place
This is the time
Waited forever, it's now or it's never
Nothing can stop you now
...
