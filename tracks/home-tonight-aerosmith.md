Now it's time 
To say good night to you 
Now it's time 
To bid you sweet adieu 

And maybe, drink a cheers to yesterday 
And maybe, you'll drink those tears away 

So baby, don't let go 
Hold on real tight 
'Cause i'll be home tonight 
Tonight 

So baby, don't let go
Hold on real tight
'Cause i'll be home tonight
Tonight
Tonight
