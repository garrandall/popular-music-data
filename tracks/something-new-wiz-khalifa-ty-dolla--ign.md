Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)


Left my heart and my soul, you see that I ran
Rings of gold and awards sit on my nightstand
I've got something they want, but it's mine to give (Yeah)
Free my struggles, detach me from this island (Free)
Bleed my knuckles, attack me for my finance
I'm dealing with this pain, I just can't let you come throw it away
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy


So I run (Yeah, yeah), keep me up
Creep on me, they speak on me
They slow down when they bring me up like (Huh)
Speed me up (Speed, yeah)
So I run (Yeah), keep me up
Creep on me, they speak on me
They slow down when they bring me up like (Yeah, huh)
Speed me up (It's Boat, speed, speed, it's Boat, yeah, ayy)


Takin' off quick, too fast, on my tippy toes
Undefeated, bro, no L's, still (Go)
Takin' off quick, too fast, on my tippy toes
Undefeated, bro, no L's, still six and oh
Run around town, profound mentality
Bad young ting, six rings sittin' under me
These dudes actin' like we ain't who they wanna be
Got me tickled, tryna act so selfishly
Pocket full of green stacked up like a pot of peas
Big boy dawg, walkin' 'round with a lot of fleas
Zoom quick, go too fast (Ayy)
Every day, I gotta make it count
Every second, gotta make it last
Roll around, do the double dash
Big glow on my skin, takin' off them tints (Hey)
Lambo (Hey)
Hold up, wait, got a date
Ladies love my speed, quick to run up trees (Yeah)
Who you seen like me? Nobody (It's Boat)
Stayin' in my lane, best friend named Tails
Balance runnin' on rails, I can never fail


So I run (Yeah), keep me up
Creep on me, they speak on me
They slow down when they bring me up like (Huh)
Speed me up (Speed, yeah)
So I run (Yeah), keep me up
Creep on me, they speak on me
They slow down when they bring me up like (Huh)
Speed me up (Speed, speed, yeah, ayy)


Speed me up, ayy, speed me up
Don't turn down the bass, someone tell the DJ leave me up
They was sleepin' on me, now they see me up, beam me up
Rings on me like LeBron, rings on me like 23
New 911, it gon' speed fast
He was talkin' down, I level up on his...
Tell lil' baby I might hit her up, 'cause she bad
Money hit my phone and now I'm runnin' to the cash, yeah, yeah
Marathon, just like Nipsey the great (Yeah)
Spin and dash to the safe, do the dash like Tay K
(I'm dealing with this pain, I just can't let you come throw it away
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)


Don't crash, really go fast
Press on the gas, four hundred my dash
Never come last
Came a long way from the back of my dad's
Since I got racks, I'ma never look back
I'm goin' fast on my way to the bank
Level up, I'm movin' up on my rank
Pedal to metal, I'm winnin' the race, yeah


So I run (Yeah), keep me up
Creep on me, they speak on me
They slow down when they bring me up like (Huh)
Speed me up (Speed, yeah)
So I run (Yeah), keep me up
Creep on me, they speak on me
They slow down when they bring me up like (Huh)
Speed me up (Speed, speed, yeah)


Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)
