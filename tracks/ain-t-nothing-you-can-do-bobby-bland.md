A-when you got a headache
A-headache powder soothe the pain
When you try to rest
Lord, you feel alright again

When you got a backache
A little rubbin' will see you through
But when you got a heartache
There ain't nothin' you can do

A man can't break a stone
So he tries another lick
An iceman can't cut his ice, no Lord
So he buys another pick

Electric lights go out
But a candle light will see you through
But when you got a heartache
There ain't nothing you can do

There ain't nothing you can do
I said there ain't nothing you can do
When you got a heartache
There ain't nothing you can do

A-when you a meet a friend
You smile because you glad
When a friend deceive you
It makes you feel so bad

When you lose your love one
It makes you feel so blue
And then you've got a heartache
And there ain't nothing you can do

Well, there ain't nothing you can do
I said, there ain't nothing you can do
Lordy!
Ev'ry time I think about it

I said, ev'rytime I get a li'l lonely, sometime
There ain't nothin' you can do, baby, no Lord

There ain't nothin' you can do
Sometimes I get so lonely
