(He's tossing and turning)
My b-b-b-baby got me
Tossin' and turnin' again

I keep on pacing the floor
Tossin' and turnin' again
Up all night, just like before
Tossin' and turnin' again

After the summer of '61
You told me your running around was done
But you've been sneaking, been having fun
That's why I'm tossin' and turnin' again

My baby got me tossin'
She got me turnin'
My baby got me
Tossin' and turnin' again

My baby got me tossin'
She got me turnin'
Babe, you got me
Tossin' and turnin' again

I'm sick and tired of this silly game
Tossin' and turnin' again
Every summer is just the same
Tossin' and turnin' again

Once a year, you make me weep
Night after night, I'm losing sleep
And I'm telling you, baby
It ain't the heat that make me
Toss and turn again

My baby got me tossin'
Well, she got me turnin'
My baby got me
Tossin' and turnin' again

Tossin' and turnin' again
Tossin' and turnin' again

Once a year, you make me weep
Night after night, I'm losing sleep
And I'm telling you, baby
It ain't the heat that's got me
Tossin' and turnin' again

My baby got me tossin'
Well, she got me turnin'
My baby got me
Tossin' and turnin' again

I couldn't sleep at all last night
(Tossin') yeah, yeah
She got me turnin'
You got me tossin' and turnin' again

I keep the blankets on the floor
(Tossin') yes, I did, I did
(Turnin') well, you got me
Tossin' and turnin' again

B-b-b-baby got me tossin'
Well, she got me turnin'
My baby got me tossin' and turnin' again
