Is this a dream
Or could it be that I'm just imagining
Is there some chance for our romance
To become reality

Did I hear you say
There was a chance for our love
A chance for us to play the game
Oh, to play the game

All night long I tried to remember
What is some thing that you said
Did you say that to me, baby

Oh, just one touch from you (One touch from you)
Little girl, I come unglued
I lose all trace of time
And everything seems to slip my mind

Got to find the right solution (The right solution)
Got to find a way to end all this confusion
In my mind
Oh, in my mind

This is a brand new feelin'
A strange sensation
I just seem to lose my head
Over you, baby

Amnesia
I can't remember what you said
What made me go and lose my head
Please understand the things I did, oh

Amnesia
The way you made sweet love to me
Oh, the price you pay for ecstasy
Girl, don't you know what you're doin' to me

The say love is blind
The say that love can make you lose your mind (Lose your mind)
No matter what they say
Sweet darlin', I know our love will shine

All night long, I'll lay beside you
Holdin' you closer, holdin' you tighter
Lovin' you
Touchin' you, and squeezin' you, baby

This is a brand new feelin'
A strange sensation
Your kiss makes me lose my head
Oh, I lost it for you, baby

Amnesia
I can't remember what you said
What made me go and lose my head
Please understand the things I did, ho

Amnesia
The way you made sweet love to me
Oh, the price you pay is ecstasy
Oh, girl, don't you know what you're doin' to me, hoo, oh

Amnesia
I can't remember what you said
What made me go and lose my head
Please understand the things I did, ho

Amnesia
The way you made sweet love to me
Oh, the price you pay for ecstasy
Girl, don't you know what you're doin' to me, oh

Amnesia
The way you made sweet love to me
Oh, the price you pay is ecstasy
