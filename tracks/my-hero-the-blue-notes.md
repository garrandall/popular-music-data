Oh come, come
I love you true

Come, come
I love you only
My heart is true
Come, come
My life is lonely
I long for you

Come, come
None can replace you
My arms are aching
Long to embrace you
My love divine

Come, come
I love you truly
My hero, mine

Come, come
None can replace you
My arms are aching
Long to embrace you
My love divine

Come, come
I love you truly
My hero, my hero, mine
