America, I love you
Even after everything you put my blood through
Every descendant of a slave ought to cuss you
Throw a middle finger up and say...
America, my love's true
Even after everything you put my blood through
Every descendant of a slave ought to cut you
Pull out an AK and spray
But that ain't love


And on this long road to perdition
You might wanna use my navigation system-my wisdom
Shine light through this black prism
My rhythm let it guide you through baptism
Word to Shirley Chisolm, I'm truly tryna blaze trails
Write back senders of the hate mail, that keeps comin'
Caged bird still singing, chain gang still drummin'
100 miles and we still runnin' 400 years
Give me a pound of Bob Marley
American flags strapped to the back of black Harleys
And if we burn you down it's to begin anew
Let's pull the sheet off of our history and bid adieu


America, I love you
Even after everything you put my blood through
Every descendant of a slave ought to cuss you
Throw a middle finger up and say...
America, my love's true
Even after everything you put my blood through
Every descendant of a slave ought to cut you
Pull out an AK and spray
But that ain't love


Banner in the sky, the U.S. is alive
Everything before it absorb it or let it die
Daughter of four fathers, no momma to get it right
Raised and became a beauty with something ugly inside
Growing up abused with bruises of different hues
Read, white lies now our lady sings the blues
Over C notes while we broke and see votes for people
Both villain and hero, competing stroking her ego
That talk the talk come time to walk do absolutely zero
Cheer us on the court but when it's foul we get no free throw
But we go hard off hope and for the love
With all my heart still covered in blood


Like a beauty from the heavens up above
But hold her tight you 'bout to see close up
Past smooth skin you'll find something so rough
Can we keep her true?
I don't know (I don't know)
What to do (What to do)
(I don't know what to do)
And she don't either (She don't either)
Red, white, blues (Red, white, blues)
Red, white, blues
Red, white and blues
