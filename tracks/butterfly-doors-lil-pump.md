CB on the beat, ho
Butterfly doors (Brr)
Jetski, Jetski
Yeah

Butterfly doors (Oh)
Space coupe look like a UFO (Whoa)
Smokin' on dope (Damn)
They call me Yao **** 'cause my eyes real low (Low)
Pourin' up fours (Whoa)
Baby mama whip a pot on the stove (Whip it)
Ain't no joke (No)
You the type of nigga go cry to a ho (Ho)
Butterfly doors (Doors)
Space coupe look like a UFO (Whoa)
Smokin' on dope (Damn)
They call me Yao **** 'cause my eyes real low (Low)
Pourin' up fours (Whoa)
Baby mama whip a pot on the stove (Mama)
Ain't no joke (Brr)
You the type of nigga go cry to a ho (Ho)

If I go broke, I'ma kick doors (Kick doors)
I'ma go back to sellin' nicks at the Citgo (Citgo)
I can't go, no
Hop on a flight if I ain't got my pole (Pole)
Smellin' like gas through the border patrol (Patrol)
I ran outta drank so I canceled my show, whoa
I piss on these racks on the floor (Brr), oh
I got a Glock in my trenchcoat (Uh-huh)
Canceled the show, lost a 100K (100K)
Made that shit back in like half a day (Half a day)
Just got outta jail, got another case (Whoa)
Jack a nigga car and his license plate (Goddamn)
Two Lamborghinis with the butterfly doors (Butterfly)
I feel like the old Gucci, bitch, I'm burnt and I'm froze (I'm burnt, yeah)

Butterfly doors (Oh)
Space coupe look like a UFO (Whoa)
Smokin' on dope (Damn)
They call me Yao **** 'cause my eyes real low (Low)
Pourin' up fours (Whoa)
Baby mama whip a pot on the stove (Whip it)
Ain't no joke (No)
You the type of nigga go cry to a ho (Ho)
Butterfly doors (Doors)
Space coupe look like a UFO (Whoa)
Smokin' on dope (Damn)
They call me Yao **** 'cause my eyes real low (Low)
Pourin' up fours (Whoa)
Baby mama whip a pot on the stove (Mama)
Ain't no joke (Brr)
You the type of nigga go cry to a ho (Ho)
