Oh, look at you
I hate to see you cry
Hey, come here
I know you're kind of blue
Cause love ain't been good to you

Well, dry your pretty eyes
Those days are through
Cause you're in good hands now

All the love you gave
Gone to waste
All the heartache
He made you face

Things will be different now
With me in his place
You're in good hands now

If trouble ever comes to you
I'll see you through, me and you
And whenever you are down
I'll be around

You will never have
A need for anything
And I mean that, baby

I would always bring
True happiness to you
Cause I realize, I realize
It's your heart I have here
So delicate, and, oh, so rare
I promise I will handle it
With tender loving care

Hey, you're in good hands now
Baby, you're in good hands now
Don't worry 'bout a thing, girl
Baby you're in good hands now

Baby, kiss my shoulder
Baby, you're in good hands now
You're in good hands now
