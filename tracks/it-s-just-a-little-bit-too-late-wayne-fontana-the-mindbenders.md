What good does it do
To worry about the past
I know I can't undo
The wrong I've done
But please baby please
I'm begging on my knees
Please take me back
And give me one more chance

No, no, no, no
It's just a little bit too late
A little bit too late now
It's just a little bit too late

Oh, girl
Can't you see?
There's been a change in me
My eyes are closed
But now I see the light
This lone loneliness
Is tearing me apart
I did you wrong
But now I'll make it right

No, no, no, no
It's just a little bit too late
A little bit too late now
It's just a little bit too late.
