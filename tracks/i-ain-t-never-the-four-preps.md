Well, I ain't never
I ain't never
A-seen nobody like you
No no no
Never, have I ever

You call me up to say you'll meet me at nine
I have to hurry hurry that I'm there on time
I walk right up and knock on your door
The landlord says she ain't here no more,
Oh darling

Boo-hoo but I love you
Yeah I love you

You tell me sweet things that you don't mean
You got me a-livin' in a honey dream
You make me do things I don't wanna do
My friends'll say, "Webb what's wrong with you?"
Oh darling

Boo-hoo but I love you
Yeah I love you
I love you just the same
I love you just the same
I love you just the same
