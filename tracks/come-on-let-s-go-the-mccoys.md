Well, come on, let's go, let's go, little darlin'
Tell me that you'll never leave me
Come on, come on, let's go again
Go again and again

Well, now, swing me, swing me, swing me, little darlin'
Come on, let's go, little darlin'
Let's go, let's go again once more

Well, I love you, babe
And I'll never let you go
Come on, baby, so, oh, pretty baby, I love you so

Well, let's go, let's go, let's go, little sweetheart
Forever we can always be together
Come on, come on, let's go again

Oh, well, I love you, babe
And I'll never let you go
Come on, baby, so, oh, pretty baby, I love you so

Well, come on, let's go, let's go, little darlin'
Tell me that you'll never leave me
Come on, come on, let's go again
Again, again, and again
Again, again, and again
Again, again, and again
