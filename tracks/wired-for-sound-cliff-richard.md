I like small speakers - I like tall speakers
If they've music - they've wired for sound

Walkin' about with a head full of music
Cassette in my pocket and I'm gonna use it-stereo
- out on the street you know - woh oh woh...

Into the car go to work I'm cruisin'
I never think that I'll blow all my fuses
Traffic flows-into the breakfast show - woh oh woh...

Power from the needle to the plastic
A.M. - F.M. I feel so ecstatic now
It's music I've found
And I'm wired for sound

I was small boy who don't like his toys
I could not wait to get wired for sound

I met a girl and she told me she loved me
I said you love me then love means you must like what I like-
My music is dynamite - woh oh woh...

She said - I'm not a girl you put on at a stand by
I am a girl who demands that her love is amplified
Switch in to overdrive-woh oh woh

Power from the needle to the plastic
A.M. - F.M. I feel so ecstatic now
It's music I've found
And I'm wired for sound
