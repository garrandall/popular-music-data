I don't want my arms around you, no not much
I don't bless the day I found you, no not much
I don't need you like the stars don't need the sky
I won't love you longer than the day I die

You don't please me when you squeeze me, no not much
My heads the lightest from your very slightest touch
Baby, if you ever go could I take it maybe so
Oh but would I like it, no not much

Like the song I'm singing doesn't mean a rhyme
I don't want you near me only all time

You don't thrill me when you hold me, no not much
My heads the lightest from your very slightest touch
Baby if you ever go could I take it maybe so
Oh but would I like it, no not much
No not much
