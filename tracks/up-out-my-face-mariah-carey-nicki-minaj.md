It's not chipped (No), we're not cracked (Uh-uh)
Oh, we're shattered
Mariah... Hey-ey
Young Money! (Young Money!) hey-ey
Nicki Minaj! (Minaj), hey-ey
You're such a Barbie!


Yo, Mariah, I was in them million dollar meetings, he was cheatin'
All up in the church, he was sneaking with the deacon
Cats away, well, the mice'll play
LOL, smiley face, have a nicer day
'Cause pop, pop, pop, there goes my rubber band
So stop, stop, stop sniffing that contraband
'Cause you was penny pinching, my accounts laced
Attention! About face


I thought we had something special, like we had something good
But I shoulda had another mechanic under my hood
If you see me walking by you, boy, don't you even speak
Pretend you on the sofa and I'm on the TV
Might see me on a poster, see me at a show
But you won't see me for free, boy, this ain't no promo


In all shame now (Shame now)
Where ever you been laying, you can stay now (Stay now)
Gotta board the BBJ and pull the shades down (Shades down)
I'm on the plane now
And don't keep calling from your mama's house


When I break, I break, boy
Up out my face, boy (Up out my face)
Up out my face, boy (Up out my face)
Up out my face, boy (Up out my face)
When I break
Up out my face, boy (Up out my face)
Up out my face, boy (Up out my face)
Up out my face, boy (Up out my face)
When I break


You ain't never gonna feel this thing again (Uh-uh)
You gon' get alot of calls 'cause I CC-ed all your friends
(When I break, I break)
I ain't walking 'round no more
Feeling sad, that ain't even my bag, baby
I break, when I break, I break
Mariah


So look who's crying now, boo-hoo-hoo
Talking 'bout you missing your boo, hoo-hoo
Oh no, you ain't gettin' it
I know you ain't hittin' it
No, you ain't a rapper, so you need to stop spittin' it
Ha ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
You wondering who I'm messing while you ain't next to me
Go ha ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
So pay the consequences 'cause you acted all ignorant


You ashamed now
Where ever you been laying, you can stay now
Gotta board the BBJ and pull the shades down
I'm on the plane now (Mmm-hmm)
And don't keep calling from your mama's house (Yo, yo)
When I break, I


Yo, styling on them big B's, bought the Benz out
Elevator, press P for the penthouse
Top doe's, then we break like tacos
Roscoe's, on his knees with a snot-nose
They be like, "She next!", Kawasaki T-Rex
Give em' some Kleenex, match his little V-Necks (V-Necks)
Oh, that's what he left? Let his mama pick it up (Pick it up)
Might back up on it, VROOM VROOM, with the pick-up truck
That blue and yellow, yeah, that's the Carmelo Jag
I bob and weave em', hit em' wit that Mayweather jab
I get the thumbs up like I'm hailing a yellow cab
(Hailing a yellow cab)
My flow nuts like M&M's in the yellow bag (Mariah)


When I break, I break, I break
And no super glue can fix this shit
When I break, I break, I break (Break on 'em, girl)
Not even a welder and a builder could rebuild this shit
When I break, I break, I break
Not even a nail technician with a whole lot of gel and acrylic
Can fix this when I break, I break
If we were two Lego blocks
Even the Harvard University graduating class of 2010
Couldn't put us back together again
When I break, boy
Up out my face, boy (Up out my face)
Up out my face, boy (Up out my face)
Up out my face, boy (Up out my face)
No, no, no (When I break, I break)
Up out my face, boy (Up out my face)
Up out my face, boy (Up out my face)
Up out my face, boy (Up out my face)


Better go back to you mama's house
I told you, I put, I put his stuff on the sidewalk
I will roll over every nook and cranny with a pickup truck like
Like straight up and down
I am Nicki Minaj, can't say "ask about me"
Young Money
Up out my face, boy...
