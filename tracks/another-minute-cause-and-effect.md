Let's not wait another minute

Would you lie to me
And tell me that it isn't true?
Take the life from me
With the special little things you do
Once again I feel
It's time to to get down and kneel
Time to pray once more
That you'll give me what I came here for

Let's not wait another minute
This is love with nothing in it
Let me come and kneel before you
It's time to be what we want to be

Could you talk to me
And tell me what I want to hear?
Deep inside of me
Is a special little thing called fear
Take me in your arms
Don't tell me it's a false alarm
Give me just once more
The act that both of us came here for

Let's not wait another minute
This is love with nothing in it
Let me come and kneel before you
It's time to be what we want to be

(Could this be what I'm waiting for?)
Let's not wait another minute
(Allowing you to be with me?)
This is love with nothing in it
(So stay with me and close your eyes)
Let me come and kneel before you
(It's time to be what we want to be)
It's time to be what we want to be
