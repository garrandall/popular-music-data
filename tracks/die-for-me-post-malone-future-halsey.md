(Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
You'd die for me
(Said you'd die, said you'd die, but you lied, you lied to me)

Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me
When it's past 11, that's a different side, I see
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me

It was love at first sight, felt like you were chosen
But that blood in your veins, yeah, I know it's frozen (It's so cold)
Got no patience no more, been waiting too long
You hid that shit away and I was the last one to know
Bitch, aye, I heard you comin' in I was lying there, awake
Didn't know that it was you, got the gun right out the safe (Damn)
Remember when you got my ass arrested? (Wow)
At least when I was in jail, I got some rest in
Oh, I surrender, time to forget you
I'm too tired to forgive you, it's too hard on my liver
And you know it's all over now
All your friends, you know, they sold you out

Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me (Die for me)
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me (Lying to me)
We were on the low but you were getting high with me (High with me)
When it's past 11, that's a different side, I see
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Die, die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me (Lie, lie, lie, lie)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Die, die, die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me, yeah

It was a V.I.P., happened to be one of my best nights
9 A.M., I came from out the club, it was daylight (Daylight)
Got a bad girl, I was treatin' her too nice (I was treating her too nice)
Caught you bein' vulnerable, that ain't what I need (That ain't what I need)
You just sold your soul, girl, quit cryin' (Sold your soul)
From your passport, it looks like you lyin' (You know you cold)
You broken down by your past, don't deny it (You know I know)
Your ex called, you was vulnerable, you was flyin', nah (Flyin')
Wasn't on the best of terms, girl, I was tryin' (I was tryin')
I did everything to reach out to you (I was reachin' out)
Said you never had me caught up in no drama (No drama)
I done ran into my karma (I done ran into)

Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
I had a really bad feeling you been lying to me
We've been on the low but you been getting high with me
When it's past 11, that's a different side, I see
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me

Settle down, I'll spell it out, it's simple enough
I came around, I figured out, should follow my gut
I don't play anymore, I went through your phone
And called the girls in your DMs and took all them home
And I know it's been a while since the last time you heard from me
Grew into a savage and that's why they gave this verse to me
Turns out it shows, 'cause they turn out at shows
I sold fifteen million copies of a break-up note
Brought some strangers in our bed so now you lost your right to privacy
Spilling all our secrets when you thought they'd probably die with me
Know you fuckin' love it on the low
And you don't have to say I'm crazy, 'cause I know
Nothing's changed, though

Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
(You lied, you lied, you lied)
