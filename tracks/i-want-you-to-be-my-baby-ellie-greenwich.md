(CHORUS)
I (I) I want (I want)
I want you (I want you)
I want you to (I want you to)
I want you to be (what)
I want you to be my baby

Will (will)
Will you (will you)
Now will you please
(Will you please)
Will you please tell
(Will you please tell)
Will you please tell me (what)
If you're going to be my baby

Listen to your mama
And you never will forget it
And if anybody wonders
You can tell them that I said it

The only thing I know is
That I never can forget you
I've been longing for you, baby
Ever since the day I met you

I got you where I want you
I'm never gonna let you
Get away from me

Do what I tell you
I'm the girl for you and so
You'd better start to face it
If you ever lose my love
You know you never can replace it

I think it's time for you to
Start to give me some loving
Carrying a torch for you
That's hotter than an oven

It's time for you to give me
A little bit of loving, baby
Hold me tight and do
What I tell you

(CHORUS)

Will (will)
Will you (will you)
Will you please
(Will you please)
Will you please tell
(Will you please tell)
Will you please tell me (what)
If you're going to be my baby

(CHORUS)

Come on, baby
And hold me tight
Come on, baby
Let's dim the lights
And tell me you'll be mine
