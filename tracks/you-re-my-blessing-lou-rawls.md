My, my my my my my my
Aren't you overdue for a compliment?
And can I say that You're heaven sent?
These are the words I heard in my head
But I've never said
You defy description
And I've seen a vision of you
In a vision of my dreams

I wanna say it loud and clear
Loud and clear

I feel like I just woke up
And now the fog is gone
You're all I see
And there isn't a place in my soul except for you and me
We are coupled, kindred and free
We are coupled, kindred and free

I wanna say it loud and clear
Loud and clear
You're my blessing
You're my blessing
You're my blessing
You're my blessing

Would you blush if I stated the obvious?
With regards to your perfection,
They broke the mold,
I told them to
These are the words I heard in my head,
But I've never said
You defy description,
And I've seen a vision of you in a vision of my dreams

I wanna say it loud and clear,
Loud and clear
You're my blessing
