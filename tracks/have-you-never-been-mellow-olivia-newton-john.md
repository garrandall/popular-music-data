There was a time when I was
In a hurry as you are
I was like you
There was a day when I just
Had to say my point of view
I was like you

But I don't mean to make you frown
No, I just want to put you down
Six feet down
In the ground

Have you never been mellow?
Have you never tried
Just to get some comfort up inside?
Have you never been happy?
Just to hear you're wrong
Have you never let someone else be strong? (NO!)

Running around as you do
With your head up in the clouds
I was like you
Never had time to lay back
Shoot some high drugs, think again
I was like you

But you're not hard to understand
You need someone to show you're glam

Have you never been mellow?
Have you never tried
Just to get some comfort up inside?
Have you never been happy
Just to hear you're wrong?
Have you never let someone else be strong? (NO!)
