You were a problem child
Been grounded your whole life
So now you running wild
Playing with them good girls
No, that ain't your style

You think you're hot shit
Oh I love it, I love it, I love it
Yeah, yeah
Stumbling but yeah, you're still looking hella fine
Keep doing what you're doing and I'ma make you mine

Well, you're a hot mess and I'm falling for you
And I'm like, "Hot damn! let me make you my boo"
Cause you can shake it shake it shake it
Yeah you know what to do
You're a hot mess
I'm loving it, hell yes!

Got me hypnotized
The city's your playground
I watch you take a bite
At 5am roaming the streets
Drunk all night

You think you're hot shit
and ohI looooove it, I love it, I love it
Yeah, yeah
Stumbling but yeah, you're still looking hella fine
Keep doing what you're doing and I'ma make you mine

Well, you're a hot mess and I'm falling for you
And I'm like, "Hot damn! let me make you my boo"
Cause you can shake it shake it shake it
Yeah you know what to do
You're a hot mess
I'm loving it, hell yes!

You're a hot mess and I'm falling for you
And I'm like, "Hot damn! let me make you my boo"
Cause you can shake it shake it shake it
Yeah you know what to do
You're a hot mess
I'm loving it, hell yes!

If you're dancin' up on tables you go, you go, you got it, girl
Say that you're unstable, you go, go, go, you got it, girl
Dancin' up on tables, say that you're unstable
You're a ha-ha-ha-ha-hot, yeah, you're a hot mess
Ha-ha-ha-ha-hot, we're sayin', hell yes

Well, you're a hot mess and I'm falling for you
And I'm like, "Hot damn! let me make you my boo"
Cause you can shake it shake it shake it
Yeah you know what to do
You're a hot mess
I'm loving it, hell yes!

You're a hot mess and I'm falling for you
And I'm like, "Hot damn! let me make you my boo"
Cause you can shake it shake it shake it
Yeah you know what to do
You're a hot mess
I'm loving it, hell yes!

(Hell yes)
Hot mess, I'm lovin' it, hell yes
(Hell yes)
Hot mess, I'm lovin' it, hell yes, oh
