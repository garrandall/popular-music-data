City nights, summer breeze makes you feel alright
Neon lights, shining brightly make your brain ignite
See the girls with the dresses so tight
Give you love if the price is right
Black or white, in the streets there's no wrong and no right, no

Outta site, buy your kicks from the man in the white
Feels alright, powder pleasure in your nose tonight
See the men paint their faces and cry 
Like some girl it makes you wonder why 
City life, sure is cool but it cuts like a knife, it's your life

So forget all that you see
It's not reality 
It's just a fantasy 

Can't you see what this crazy life is doing to me
Life is just a fantasy, can you live this fantasy life
Life is just a fantasy, can you live this fantasy life

So forget all that you see
It's not reality 
It's just a fantasy 

Can't you see what this crazy life is doing to me, yeah
Life is just a fantasy, can you live this fantasy life
Life is just a fantasy, can you live this fantasy life
Life is just a fantasy, can you live this fantasy life
Life is just a fantasy, can you live this fantasy life
I know
I know
