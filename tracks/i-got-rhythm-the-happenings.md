In this vast and troubled world
We sometimes lose our way
But I am never lost
I feel this way because

Dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit
Dit-dit-rhythm, dit-dit-rhythm
Dit-dit-rhythm, dit-dit-rhythm

I've got rhythm
I've got music
I got my girl
Who could ask for anything more?

I've got good times
No more bad times
I've got my girl
Who could ask for anything more?

Old man trouble (Old man trouble)
I don't mind him (I don't mind him)
You won't find him
Round my door

I've got starlight (I've got starlight)
I've got sweet dreams (I've got sweet dreams)
I've got my girl
Who could ask for, who could ask for more?

Dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit
Dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit

Old man trouble (Old man trouble)
I don't mind him (I don't mind him)
You won't find, you're never gonna find him
Round my door

I've got rhythm (Hey, I've got rhythm)
And I've got music (Hey, I've got music)
And I've got my girl
Who could ask for anything more?

In this vast and troubled world
Dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit (Rhythm, rhythm)
Dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit (Rhythm, rhythm)
Dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit (I've got rhythm)
Dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit (I've got rhythm)
Dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit (I've got rhythm)
Dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit (I've got rhythm)
