Chico, don't get discouraged
The Man he ain't so hard to understand
Chico, if you try now
I know that you can lend a helping hand

Because there's good in everyone
And a new day has begun
You can see the morning sun if you try

And I know, things will be better
Oh yes they will for Chico and the Man
Yes they will for Chico and the Man
