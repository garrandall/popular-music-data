I, I've got it all together Cause I want someone here forever Cause you, you make me feel so right When I hold you near I only get what she feels Won't you tell me somethin Who's gonna give me lovin All I want is one thing And I need your lovin It seems that I won't get much closer My dreams are pushed off like a feather Cause she, shes the only thing that's real If I can survive I will redeem in her eyes I, I've got it all together Cause I want someone here forever Cause she, shes the only thing that's real If I can survive I will redeem in her eyes
