This is some of the lingua-fringa of da funk business,
And people come from miles around with an almost religious
devotion to get on down...


1 2 3 4 get your woman on the floor
Gotta Gotta get up to get down
Gotta Gotta get up to get down


What up everybody, so glad you're here
it's Coolio wit' the flow back in your ear
this ain't the fantastic voyage, but I'm still on a mission,
to see if I can get your attention

Now I want to drop some information
just a little additive to your education
I live my life by the code of the funk
600 watt amps, 18's in the trunk

When I'm on the street, you gotta feel my beat, so
throw your hands up if you're down with the C
double O, L, I, O with the flow
I'm lookin' for the party, so betta nigga know

1 2 3, it's like A B C
if hip hop didn't pay, I'd rap for free
slide, slide, but that's that past
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass




If you got beefed, then nigga eat a porkchop
once I get it goin', you know it don't stop
I break like antilocks, panties drop,
from hood to hood, block to block

Help, I need somebody
to get it goin' on in this party
baby you can do it, take your time do it right,
we can drink some liqua and do it all damn night

My name ain't Wanda, but I'll rock your world
get more bounce than a gherry curl
too many looky loos be lookin' for clues
there's a party goin' on, now whatcha gonna do, so

Grab your partner, do se do,
if you don't know who it is, it's Coolio,
slide, slide, but that's the past,
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass

Push, push, in the bush
but don't step on no toes cuz you might get smushed
it's the brother from around the way
and what I say I been comin' on three like Dr. Dre

Comin' at 'em with pattern an' a fresh pair of atoms
I hope you don't trip cuz I don't want to have to gat 'em
so move your body baby, drive the homeys crazy,
the way you shake that ass, always amaze me

Ain't no party like a west coast party
cuz a west coast party don't stop
so when you see a young nigga
in a Chevy hittin' switches, then you gotta give the nigga his props

I got size in my rise and the motion for your ocean
Coolio got the potion to kick the party open
slide, slide, but that's the past
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass.
