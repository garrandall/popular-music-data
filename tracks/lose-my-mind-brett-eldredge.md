You put me on a roller coaster, fly me on a plane
You send me to another planet, get inside my brain
I knew right when I met you, I would never be the same
But I let you take me over, girl, so I'm the one to blame


You make all my screws come loose
Got me perfectly confused
Always find a way to mess me up and drive me wild
I love the way you make me lose my mind
Lose my mind


You make me crazy and I kinda like it
You show that apple, girl, and I wanna bite it
So crazy that I gotta have it
And I never wanna get outta this straight jacket


You make all my screws come loose
Got me perfectly confused
Always find a way to mess me up and drive me wild
I love the way you make me lose my mind
Lose my mind


I feel the walls closing in inside this padded room
Only good thing about it is I'm locked in here with you
I'm always watching you, wondering what you'll do next
But my favorite part about it is, is I always have to guess
(you know I do)


You make all my screws come loose
Got me perfectly confused
Always find a way to mess me up and drive me wild
I love the way you make me lose my mind
Make me lose my mind
Lose my mind
Make me lose my mind
Make me lose my mind
Lose my mind
