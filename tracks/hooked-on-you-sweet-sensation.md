I can't explain what I'm going through
Wish I could find the right words to say
Losing control and it's over you
Nobody else could make me feel this way
Could it just be that I'm curious
And I want to make you play my game
But something tells me that its serious
Because I go insane when I hear your name

I'm hooked on you
I'm hooked on you, what can I do
It's over you

I try to hide it but I know its true
My body trembles when I look in your eyes
I'm so turned on, I don't know what to do
It seems a touch can make my temperature rise
Could it just be that I'm curious
And I want to make you play my game
But something tells me that its serious
Because I go insane when I hear your name

I'm hooked on you
I'm hooked on you, you make me feel so good, what can I do
It's over you
I'm hooked on you
I'm needing you baby
I'm hooked on you, I'm needing you baby, what can I do
Won't you say you love me

What can I do, it's over you

Days go warm, and nights go cold
You are the one I need to hold
Try decide, this love is made
Loving you can set me free
I'm hooked on you can't you see
Hearts on fire
Higher, higher
Nobody else can make me feel the way that you do

Could it be that this time love has taken all control
Your the one who's touch I need, the one I need to hold
Could it be that this time love has taken all control
I'm hooked on you, your the one I need to hold
What can I do, it's over you
