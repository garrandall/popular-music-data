So I guess it's over baby
DéjÃ  vu again
Who'd have thought that time don't stop
And somehow girl, the world keeps spinning
I guess I've turned myself into a solitary man
Ain't like I'm the only one
That's in the shoes that I am

Do you hear that
I'm right back
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that
It's where I'm at
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn

I know that it might sound jaded
And I have to say
I think love is overrated
But I don't like throwing it away

I know you could probably tell me
Right where I went wrong
Some guys can't have all the luck
If others don't sing sad songs

Do you hear that
I'm right back
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that
It's where I'm at
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn

That's right
Another lover
Another lover crash and burn
Oh yeah

Do you hear that
I'm right back
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that
It's where I'm at
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn
Yeah, I let another lover crash and burn

Mhhhmm

Mhhhmm
