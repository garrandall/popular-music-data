I've never been wrong
But you're the the only one I trust to show me the way
I always hear your voice
And in my dreams I hear you calling my name
What is it about you?
Some kind of light shines from your face
And I can't turn away
I'm like a prisoner
Captured by your eyes
I've been taken
And I've been hypnotized
I'm like a prisoner
Captured by your eyes
I've been taken
And I've been hypnotized
And your eyes say everything
You want to keep me here forever, I can't escape
One minute's so sincere
Then you completely turn against me and I'm afraid
You don't have to say you love me
'cause if you want me, i'll stay
'cause I can't turn away
I'm like a prisoner
Captured by your eyes
I've been taken
Taken by surprise
I'm like a prisoner
Captured by your eyes
I've been taken
And I've been hypnotized
I'm like a prisoner
