Oh I fall apart
Oh yeah, mmm, yeah


She told me that I'm not enough (Yeah)
And she left me with a broken heart (Yeah)
She fooled me twice and it's all my fault (Yeah)
She cut too deep, now she left me scarred (Yeah)
Now there's so many thoughts goin' through my brain (Yeah)
And now I'm takin' these shots like it's Novocaine, yeah


Oh I fall apart
Down to my core
Oh I fall apart
Down to my core
Oh didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought


Never caught a feelin' this hard
Harder than the liquor I pour
Tell me you don't want me no more
But I can't let go, everybody told me so
Feelin' like I sold my soul
Devil in the form of a whore
Devil in the form of a whore
You said it, no, you said it
No, you said that shit, we'd be together, oh


Oh I fall apart
Down to my core
Oh I fall apart
Down to my core
Oh didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought


Ice keep pourin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
Covered in scars and I can't help showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep rollin'
Ice keep droppin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
All these scars, can't help from showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep blowin', yeah


Oh I fall apart
Down to my core
Oh I fall apart
Down to my core
Oh didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought
