Ooh, I fall apart
Ooh, I fall apart

She told me that I'm not enough (Yeah)
And she left me with a broken heart (Yeah)
She fooled me twice and it's all my fault (Yeah)
She cut too deep, now she left me scarred (Yeah)
Now there's so many thoughts goin' through my brain
And now I'm takin' these shots like it's Novocaine

Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

I never caught a feelin' this hard
Harder than the liquor I pour
Tell me you don't want me no more
But I can't let go
Everybody told me so, everybody told me so
I'm feelin' like I sold my soul
Feelin' like I sold my soul

You said it, no, you said it
No, you said it, we'd be together, oh

Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

Ice keep pourin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
Covered in scars and I can't help showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep rollin'
Ice keep pourin' and the drink keep flowin'
I try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
I'm covered in scars and I can't help showin'

Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

Ooh, I fall apart
I fall apart
I'm falling apart
I fall apart
