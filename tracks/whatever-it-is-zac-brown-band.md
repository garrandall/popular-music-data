She got eyes that cut you like a
Knife and lips that taste like sweet red wine
And her pretty legs go to heaven every time
She got a gentle way that puts me at ease
And when she walks in a room I can hardly breathe
Got a devastating smile knock a grown man to his knees

She got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I want to say to a woman
But I couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out "I love you"
You got whatever it is

You know I've never been the type that would ever want to stay
Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day
But that all changed when she walked into my life
And people ask me why it is
Tell them I don't know
There's just something 'bout the woman makes my heart go haywire
She's gonna be my wife

She got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I want to say to a woman
But I couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out "I love you"
You got whatever it is

'Cause when she loves me
Girl that's how I feel
'Cause when she loves me
I'm on top of the world
'Cause when she loves me
No, I can live forever
And when she loves me
I am untouchable

She's got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman
But couldn't find the words to say
She's got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out "I love you" (I do)
You got whatever it is
Oh, you got whatever it is
