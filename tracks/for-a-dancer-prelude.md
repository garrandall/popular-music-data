A night like this
You were wasted
Like a teenager in love
I felt your touch, it was naked
And I could not give you up.

Suddenly the room started spinning around
Oh, I couldnât wait for an answer
Fireworks and strobes bring our knees to the ground
Oh, I never thought you were a dancer

Lean in close
And donât let go

Well you started out a stranger
Foolish behavior brought us together
Tonight
Could have ran away scared
But somewhere out there
Foolish behavior seems right
I donât know if itâs good
Iâm misunderstood
Most of my whole damn life
Well you started out a stranger
Foolish behavior brought us together
Tonight
Tonight
Oh, Tonight

A night like this
Every minute is a prelude to the show
Face to face
Get lost in it
Your eyes can tell me where to go

Suddenly the room is a big black and white
Just like a scene from a movie
Everythingâs in slow motion, flashing with light
Yeah, you know how to rule me

Lean in close
And donât let go

Well you started out a stranger
Foolish behavior brought us together
Tonight
Could have ran away scared
But somewhere out there
Foolish behavior seems right
I donât know if itâs good
Iâm misunderstood
Most of my whole damn life
Well you started out a stranger
Foolish behavior brought us together
Tonight
Tonight

Think of the moment
Everythingâs on
Now set it in motion
Before itâs gone, gone, gone

Well you started out a stranger

Well you started out a stranger

Well you started out a stranger
Foolish behavior brought us together
Tonight
Could have ran away scared
But somewhere out there
Foolish behavior seems right

Tonight
Think of the moment
Everythingâs on
Oh, Tonight

Hmm, Tonight
Now set it in motion
Before itâs gone 
Oh, Tonight
