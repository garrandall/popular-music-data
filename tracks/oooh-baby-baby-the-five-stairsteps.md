Oh la la la la
Oh la la la la

I did you wrong, my heart wend out to play
But in the game I lost you, what a price to pay
I'm cryin'

(Incomprehensible)
Oh baby, baby
(Incomprehensible)

Mistakes, I know I've made a few
But I'm only human, You've made mistakes too
I'm cryin'

Ohoh oh baby, baby
Ohoh oh baby, baby

I'm just about at the end of my rope
But I'll keep on tryin', I can't give up hope

That I'll someday I'll hold you near
Whisper, I still love you until the day is here
I'm cryin'

Ohoh oh baby, baby
Ohoh oh baby, baby

Ohoh oh oh
