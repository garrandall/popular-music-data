Ooh, la la la la
Ooh, la la la la

I did you wrong, my heart wend out to play
But in the game I lost you, what a price to pay
I'm cryin'

(Incomprehensible)
Ooh baby, baby
(Incomprehensible)

Mistakes, I know I've made a few
But I'm only human, You've made mistakes too
I'm cryin'

Ooh oh oh baby, baby
Ooh oh oh baby, baby

I'm just about at the end of my rope
But I'll keep on tryin', I can't give up hope

That I'll someday I'll hold you near
Whisper, I still love you until the day is here
I'm cryin'

Ooh oh oh baby, baby
Ooh oh oh baby, baby

Ooh oh oh ohh
