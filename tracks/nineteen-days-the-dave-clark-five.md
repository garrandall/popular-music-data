In nineteen days
In nineteen days

Nineteen days before I get to see my lovin' girl again
Nineteen days, been away too long, I can't stand the pain
I'm gonna be movin' on home (baby!)
I'm gonna be movin' on home
Movin' on home, I hope I find you waiting there

Nineteen days, each town I go to brings me nearer home
Nineteen days, been workin' too hard every finger to the bone

I'm gonna be movin' on home (baby!)
Gonna be movin' on home
Movin' on home, I hope I find you waiting there

In nineteen days

I'm gonna be movin' on home (baby!)
Gonna be movin' on home
Movin' on home, I hope I find you waiting there

In nineteen days
In nineteen days
In nineteen days
