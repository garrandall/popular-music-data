When we first met on the rooftop of that hotel
Everyone around us could see, we got on well
So we took the elevator straight up to the forty second floor
When we kissed in your doorway, it's like we never kissed before

I was in love again, and I knew that you were too
We spent every night together, nothing was kaboom
And early in the morning with the sunlight in your hair
I knew we'd stick together, you were the answer to my prayers

How could I be so wrong (so wrong) for so long (so long)
How could I be so wrong (so wrong) for so long (so long)
How could I (how could I) be so wrong (so wrong) for so long (so long)

All the time we spent together so close and true
Living for each other together thru the blues
Two stars like lovers beneath the Tennessee moon
We near as we could be to Johnny Cash and June

How could I be so wrong (so wrong) for so long (so long)
How could I be so wrong (so wrong) for so long (so long)
How could I (how could I) be so wrong (so wrong) for so long (so long)
For so long (for so long)
For so long

Then I heard a rumor, from an old friend of mine
He been seeing someone else, I never saw the signs
I hope he makes you happy and that he is happy too
And just like all the others, I'll get over you

But how could I be so wrong (so wrong) for so long (so long)
How could I be so wrong (so wrong) for so long (so long)
How could I (how could I) be so wrong (so wrong) for so long (so long)
How could I be so wrong for so long
