Wonder who is waiting for me
At the end of Heartbreak Road
Hope that she'll be tender
Someone I can know

Heartaches just don't, don't last forever
But it's a lonely road
A road we all must travel
Once before we go

I believe that love's a good teacher
When you're in it
And darling even if it don't work out
You ain't gone never understand it
'Til you been all down in it
And find out what it's all about
But that's all right because

Heartaches just don't, don't last forever
But it's a lonely road
A road we all must travel
Once before we go

I believe that love's a good teacher
When you're in it
And even if it don't work out
You ain't gone never understand it
'Til you been all down in it
And find out what it's all about
But that's all right because

Heartaches just don't, don't last forever
But it's a lonely road
A road we all must travel
Once before we go
