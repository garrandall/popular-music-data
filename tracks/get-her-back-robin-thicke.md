(All I wanna do)
Is keep it light, keep it light
(Keep her satisfied)
(All I wanna do)
Is make it right, make it right
(Is make you smile all night)
(All I wanna do)
Is give you that thing
Play you that song you and your girlfriends sing
(All I wanna do)
Is get you back tonight

I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her back
I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her back
I gotta treat her right, whoa I gotta cherish her for life
I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her tonight


I never should’ve raised my voice, or made you feel so small
I never should’ve asked you to do anything at all
I should’ve kissed you longer
I should’ve held you stronger
And I’ll wait for forever for you love me again


(All I wanna do)
Is keep it light, keep it light
(Keep her satisfied)
(All I wanna do)
Is make it right, make it right
(Is make you smile all night)
(All I wanna do)
Is give you that thing
Play you that song you and your girlfriends sing
(All I wanna do)
Is get you back tonight


Oh it’s so hard (it’s so hard)
Oh it’s so hard (Oh it’s so hard)
But it doesn’t have to be

Cause ...


(All I wanna do)
Is keep it light, keep it light
(Keep her satisfied)
(All I wanna do)
Is make it right, make it right
(Is make you smile all night)
(All I wanna do)
Is give you that thing
Play you that song you and your girlfriends sing
(All I wanna do)
Is get you back tonight
(All I wanna do)
Is keep it light, keep it light
(Keep her satisfied)
(All I wanna do)
Is make it right, make it right
(Is make you smile all night)
(All I wanna do)
Is give you that thing
Play you that song you and your girlfriends sing
(All I wanna do)
Is get you back tonight
