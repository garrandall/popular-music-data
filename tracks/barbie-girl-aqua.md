Hi, Barbie
Hi, Ken!
Do you wanna go for a ride?
Sure, Ken!
Jump in...

I'm a Barbie girl in the Barbie world
Life in plastic, it's fantastic!
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation
Come on, Barbie, let's go party!

I'm a Barbie girl in the Barbie world
Life in plastic, it's fantastic!
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation

I'm a blond bimbo girl in a fantasy world
Dress me up, make it tight, I'm your dolly
You're my doll, rock'n'roll, feel the glamour in pink,
Kiss me here, touch me there, hanky panky...
You can touch, you can play, if you say, "I'm always yours."

(uu-oh-u)

I'm a Barbie girl in the Barbie world
Life in plastic, it's fantastic!
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation

Come on, Barbie, let's go party!

Come on, Barbie, let's go party!
(uu-oh-u)
Come on, Barbie, let's go party!
(ah-ah-ah-yeah)
Come on, Barbie, let's go party!
(uu-oh-u)

Make me walk, make me talk, do whatever you please
I can act like a star, I can beg on my knees
Come jump in, bimbo friend, let us do it again,
Hit the town, fool around, let's go party
You can touch, you can play, if you say, "I'm always yours."
You can touch, you can play, if you say, "I'm always yours."

Come on, Barbie, let's go party!
(ah-ah-ah-yeah)
Come on, Barbie, let's go party!
(uu-oh-u)
Come on, Barbie, let's go party!

Oh, I love you, Ken!
