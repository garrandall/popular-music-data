La da da da da da
Hey hey hey goodbye (good riddens)
Hold up

Only rapper to rewrite history without a pen
No ID on the track let the story begin
Begin, begin

This is anti-AutoTune, death of the ringtone
This is ain't for Itunes, this ain't for sing alongs
This is Sinatra at the opera, bring a blonde
Preferably with a fat ass who can sing a song

Wrong, this ain't politically correct
This might offend my political connects
My raps don't have melodies
This shit make niggas wanna go and commit felonies

Ah, get your chain tooken
I may do it myself, I'm so Brooklyn
I know we facin' a recession
But the music y'all makin' gon' make it the great depression

Ah, or your lack of aggression
Pull your skirt back down, grow a set men
Ah, ah... nigga this shit violent
This is death of AutoTune, ah moment of silence

La da da da, hey hey hey goodbye (Hold up)

Only rapper to rewrite history without a pen
No ID on the track let the story begin
Begin, begin

Hold up, this ain't a number one record
This is practically assault with a deadly weapon
I made this just for Flex and Mr. C
I want niggas to feel threatened

Stop your blood clot crying
The kid, the dog, everybody dying
No lyin', your niggas' jeans too tight
Your colors too bright, your voice too light

I might wear black four years straight
I might bring back Versace shades
This ain't for Z100
Ye told me to kill y'all to keep it 100

This is for Hot 9-7
The shit for clue for Khaled, for we the best and
Nigga this shit violent
This is death of AutoTune, moment of silence

La da da da, hey hey hey goodbye (Hold up)

Only rapper to rewrite history without a pen
No ID on the track let the story begin
Begin, begin

Hold up, this shit need a verse from Jeezy, ay!
I might send this to the mixtape Weezy
Get somebody from BMF to talk on this
Give this to a Blood, let a Crip walk on it

Get me Pharrell to style on this
I just don't need nobody to smile on this
Y'all niggas singin' too much
Get back to rap, you T-Pain'n too much
Ah, I'm a multi-millionaire
So, how is it I'm still the hardest nigga here?
I don't be in the project hallway
Talkin' 'bout how I be in the project all day
That sounds stupid to me
If you a gangsta, this is how you prove it to me
Nigga, just get violent
This is death of AutoTune, moment of silence

La da da da, hey hey hey goodbye
