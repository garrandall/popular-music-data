Talk about love, talk about trust
Talkin' 'bout forever baby
When I'm talkin' 'bout us
I give you my word, stick to my guns
Believe when I tell ya baby
That we've just begun

You don't understand, no
The full intent of my plan


I wanna be your soul provider
I wanna stay that way
For the longest time
I wanna be, your soul provider
Just say you'll let me
And darlin' I will

I know you've been hurt, I know you're love shy
You don't have to say it baby
It's gonna take some time
Ya got my heart, in the palm of your hand
Swear it's gonna stay there baby
Give me half a chance

You don't understand
The full intent of my plan

I've been waitin' for a long time for somebody like you
To give my love, all my love day and night
Just say you'll be mine for the rest of your life
Baby I'll show you why
