Been out on the road
'Bout six months too long
I want you so bad
I can hardly stand it

I'm so tired
And I'm all alone
We'll soon be together

And that's it
I'm comin' home
To your love

Hitchhiking on the turnpike
All day long
Nobody seemed to notice
They just pass me on by

To keep from going crazy
I got to sing my song
Got a whole lot of lovin'

And baby that's why
I'm comin' home
To your love
Comin' home, yeah

Comin' home
Comin' home
Comin' home
