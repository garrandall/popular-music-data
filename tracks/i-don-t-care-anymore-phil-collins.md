Well you can tell everyone I'm a down disgrace
Drag my name all over the place
I don't care anymore
You can tell ev'rybody 'bout the state I'm in
You won't catch me crying 'cos I just can't win
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore, d'you hear?


I don't care what you say
I don't play the same games you play


'Cos I've been talking to the people that you call your friends
And it seems to me there's a means to an end
They don't care anymore
And as for me I can sit here and bide my time
I got nothing to lose if I speak my mind
I don't care anymore
I don't care no more


I don't care what you say
We never played by the same rules anyway


I won't be there anymore
Get out of my way
Let me by
I got better things to do with my time
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore


Well, I don't care now what you say
'Cos every day I'm feeling fine with myself
And I don't care now what you say
Hey, I'll do alright by myself
'Cos I don't


'Cos I remember all the times I tried so hard
And you laughed in my face 'cos you held all the cards
I don't care anymore
And I really ain't bothered what you think of me
'Cos all I want of you is just a let me be!
I don't care anymore!
D'you hear?! I don't care no more!


I don't care what you say
I never did believe you much anyway


I won't be there no more
So get out of my way
Let me by
I got better things to do with my time
I don't care anymore
D'you hear? I don't care anymore
I don't care no more
You listening? I don't care no more
No more!

You know I don't care no more!


No more, No more
No more, No more
No more, No more
No more, No more
No more, No more
No more, No more
