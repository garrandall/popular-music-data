You feel like summertime
You took this heart of mine
You be my valentine in the summer
In the summer
You are my only one
Just dance and having fun
Out in the shining sun of the summer
Of the summer

Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do
I love you
Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do
Put no one else above you
Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do
I need you
Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do

Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do
I love you
Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do
Put no one else above you
Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do
I need you
Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do

Is it summertime magic
That makes me wanna dance all night long?
It's just summertime magic
Make me feel this way
Got me hold up girl
Oh, don't mind world
Baby girl
My whole world
You feel like summertime
(Oh yes you do)
You took this heart of mine
(You know you did)
You be my valentine in the summer
In the summer

Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do
I love you
Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do
Put no one else above you
Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do
I need you
Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do
All I wanna do is let you
Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do
I love you
Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do
Put no one else above you
Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do
It's just summertime, it's just summertime magic
