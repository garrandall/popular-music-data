If I could write a letter to me
And send it back in time to myself at 17
First I'd prove it's me by saying, "Look under your bed:
There's a Skoal can and a Playboy no one else would know you hid."

And then I'd say, "I know it's tough
When you break up after seven months.
And yeah I know you really liked her and it just don't seem fair,
But all I can say is pain like that is fast and it's rare."

And oh you've got so much going for you going right
But I know at 17 it's hard to see past Friday night
She wasn't right for you
And still you feel like there's a knife
Sticking out of your back
And you're wondering if you'll survive
But you'll make it through this and you'll see
You're still around to write this letter to me

"At the stop sign at Tomlinson and Eighth
Always stop completely, don't just tap your brakes.
And when you get a date with Bridgett make sure the tank is full.
On second thought forget it. That one turns out kinda cool.

Each and every time you have a fight
Just assume you're wrong and dad is right.
And you should really thank Mrs. Brinkman:
She spends so much extra time.
It's like she sees the diamond underneath,
And she's polishing you 'til you shine."

And oh you've got so much going for you going right
But I know at 17 it's hard to see past Friday night
Tonight's the bonfire rally
But you're staying home instead
Because if you fail Algebra
Mom and dad'll kill you dead
But trust me you'll squeak by and get a C
And you're still around to write this letter to me

"You've got so much up ahead
You'll make new friends
You should see your kids and wife
And I'd end by saying have no fear
These are nowhere near the best years of your life

I guess I'll see you in the mirror
When you're a grown man
P.S. Go hug Aunt Rita every chance you can."

And oh you've got so much going for you going right
But I know at 17 it's hard to see past Friday night
I wish you'd study Spanish
I wish you'd take a typing class
I wish you wouldn't worry, let it be
I'd say have a little faith and you'll see

If I could write a letter to me
To me
