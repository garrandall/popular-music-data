If you promise me a rose
I'd go out and buy a pot
My imagination grows into roses by the plot

I've got roses on my doors
On my ceiling and my floors
And if you forget to keep your promise
For some reason or another, you fail

How can the dreamer
Of such sweet roses
Be bothered by a slight detail

If you promise me a bird
One to sing about my chair
Then a dream in me is stirred
And one bird becomes a pair

Then my room is full of song
Cause the pair becomes a throng
And if you forget to keep your promise
For a reason or another, you fail

How can the dreamer
Of such sweet music
Be bothered by a slight detail

If you even brush my hand
Absent mindedly as this
Just your touch upon my hand
I can dream into a kiss

Then the kiss begins to soar
Into love forever more
And tho your little boat has no anchor
And my little boat has no sail

How can the dreamer
On love's blue ocean
Be bothered by a slight detail
Detail, detail
