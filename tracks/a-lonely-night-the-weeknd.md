Gangster, yeah, yeah
Hey, na-na-na-na-na-na, hey

Why would you wanna bring somethin' between us
There's nothin' between us, oh, ay
Why would you wanna use a life to keep us
To keep us together, uh, oh-oh

Better when we're both apart, better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other, no good for each other
Better when we're both apart, better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other

A lonely night, baby girl I loved you on a lonely night, oh
It was the only time and if I led you on then I apologize, oh

How can I make you rethink your decision?
Unruly decision, oh
Hey, what's gonna make you rethink your position?
I know your intentions, oh-oh

Better when we're both apart, better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other, no good for each other
Better when we're both apart, better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other

A lonely night, baby girl I loved you on a lonely night, oh
It was the only time and if I led you on then I apologize, oh

Baw-baw-baw-baw-baw-baw-baw

Better when we're both apart, better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other, no good for each other
Better when we're both apart, better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other

Hey, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, oh-oh

A lonely night, baby girl I loved you on a lonely night, hey
It was the only time and if I led you on then I apologize, oh
A lonely night, baby girl I loved you on a lonely night, oh
It was the only time and if I led you on then I apologize, oh

Baby girl I loved you
Know I loved you
Know I loved you
Baby, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, ay
