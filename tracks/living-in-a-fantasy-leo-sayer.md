You, you are my reason to live
You make me shine, with all the love that you give
And when I think of you, I keep driftin' away, yeah
Little by little, I love you more every day
I lay in bed but I just can't sleep
I close my eyes and you're all that I see
I can't believe that it's happening to me
Living in a fantasy
Ever since you came to me
Yes I'm living in a fantasy
Drowning, drowning in this luxury
Ever since, Ever since you came to me
Oh I'm living in a dream
Oh, I know, there'll be storms up ahead
We'll blow them away, bring back the sun again
For love conquers all, the gloom and despair
Nothin' can go wrong, just as long as you're there
Yeah, I see a light on the path up ahead
I know you'll wait on the cliff where you said
I'll hold you close 'til we're right on the edge
Living in a fantasy
Ever since, ever since you came, you came to me
I'm just living in a fantasy
Drowning, drowning in this luxury
Ever since, ever since you came to me
Find me living in a dream
Oh you're too much, too soon, you're too strong
And I wanna drown in your touch
Don't keep me floating too long
Living in a fantasy, living in a fantasy
Ever since you came to me, ever since you came along
Living in a fantasy
Drowning in this luxury
Ever since you came to me, ever since you came to me
I'm just living in a dream
Living in a fantasy
Ever since you came to me
Living in a fantasy
Drowning in this luxury, drowning in this luxury
Ever since, ever since you came to me
Living in a dream
Well it happens every day
Love has got a hold on me
I'm drowning
Ever since you came to me
Living in a dream
