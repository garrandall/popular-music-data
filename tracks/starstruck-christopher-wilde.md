Oh Oh, yeah,
Oh Oh, yeah,
Oh Oh, yeah,
Oh Oh

Every girl every boy
They got your posters on their wall,
Yeah.
Photographs, autographs
The minute you step out the door
You will need the applause
Papparazzi's hiding in the bushes
Trying to make a dollar

Wanna be you,
When they see you,
They scream out loud!

Starstruck!
Camera flashes,
Cover of magazines
(Whoa Oh Oh)
Starstruck!
Designer sunglasses,
Livin' the dream as a teen,
All the fancy cars,
Hollywood Blvd
Hear the crowd calling your name
Yeah.
Starstruck!
Prepare to get
Starstruck!
Oh yeah

Climbing life, lookin' fly
Perfect smiles,
On the way to the limousine
Yeah
Everywhere first in line, VIP,
Hanging out with celebrities
Yeah

And all the pretty girls,
They wanna date ya
Trying to make you holler
Holler

Wanna be you,
When they see you,
They scream out loud!

Starstruck!
Camera flashes,
Cover of magazines
(Whoa Oh Oh)
Starstruck!

Livin' the dream as a teen,
All the fancy cars,
Hollywood blvd
Hear the crowd calling your name

Prepare to get.

As soon as you move
They gonna talk about it.
In the pic or the news
They gonna talk about it.
'Cause your on the A-list
You better believe it,
You better believe it.

Whatever you do
(Whatever you do)
Doesn't matter if is true
'Cause your on the top 5
And nothing can stop ya
And nothing can stop ya!
