Willie was a son of an old man
He never ever had a dime
Makin his living off of black land
But he always seemed to make out fine
Laying down all of his sweet talk
You know he was a ladies man
He was doing all right until he got caught stealing money off another man

So tell em Willie Boy's A'Comin
Tell em he's coming home
To the year and the beers oh lordy he's gone so long
Tell em Willie Boy's A'Comin
Tell em that he's on his way
If the old chatham line makes it in on time
Tell Willie's coming home to stay

Well the preacher man was preachin on a Sunday
But Willie Boy couldn't be found
Because the law came and took him away
Seen him riding out of town
Four gray walls and a bunk bed
Now Willie had to pay his dues
Now two to five years and a hard head got Willie back his walkin shoes

So tell em Willie Boy's A'Comin
Tell em he's coming home
To the year and the beers oh lordy he's gone so long
Tell em Willie Boy's A'Comin
Tell em that he's on his way
If the old chatham line makes it in on time
Tell Willie's coming home to stay

So tell em Willie Boy's A'Comin
Tell em he's coming home
To the year and the beers oh lordy he's gone so long
Tell em Willie Boy's A'Comin
Tell em that he's on his way
If the old chatham line makes it in on time
Tell Willie's coming home to stay

If the old chatham line makes it in on time
Tell Willie's coming home to stay
