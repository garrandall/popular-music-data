(Andrea)
Sei hai paura
Piangera'
E dentro gli'occhi tuoi
La ...
Il correrera'
E' l'asiugero'...
Il sole rivertrai
Like a bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down
(Mary)
When you're down and out, when you're on the street
When evening falls, when it falls so hard I will comfort you
I'll take your part
When darkness comes, oh yeah, and pain is all, all around
Like a bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down
(Andrea) I will lay me down, (Mary) I will lay me down
(Both)
Sail on silver girl, sail on by
Your time has come to shine
(Andrea) All you dreams, (Mary) All those dreams are on their way
(Both) See how they shine
(Mary) Oh-oh
If you need a friend, if you need a friend...
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down, I will lay me down
(Both) Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
I will ease your mind
I will ease your mind
I will ease your mind
I will ease your mind
I will ease your mind
