Gonna find my baby, gonna hold her tight
Gonna grab some afternoon delight
My motto's always been "When it's right, it's right"
Why wait until the middle of a cold dark night
When everything's a little clearer in the light of day
And we know the night is always gonna be here any way

Thinkin' of you's workin' up my appetite
Looking forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbin' sticks and stones together make the sparks ignite
And the thought of loving you is getting so exciting

Sky rockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight

Started out this morning feeling so polite
I always thought a fish could not be caught who didn't bite
But you've got some bait a waitin' and I think I might
Like nibblin' in a little afternoon delight

Sky rockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight

Please' be waiting for me baby when I come around
We could make a lot of lovin' 'fore the sun goes down

Thinkin' of you's workin' up an appetite
Looking forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbin' sticks and stones together make the sparks ignite
And the thought of loving you is getting so exciting

Sky rockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
