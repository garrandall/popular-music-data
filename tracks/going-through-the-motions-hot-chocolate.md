Just goin' through the motions
Goin' through the motions
Goin' through the motions
Just goin' through the motions

Your heart is not in it, baby
You're kissin' me, but your lips are cold
Your heart is not in it, baby
Your eyes are closed, but you're not here with me

Goin' through the motions
Just goin' through the motions
Goin' through the motions
Just goin' through the motions

I can feel your love
Feel it flowing away, flowing away, flowing away, flowing away
I can feel your love
I can feel it flowing away, flowing away, flowing away, flowing away

I can feel your love, baby
Flowing away, flowing away, flowing away, flowing away
I can feel your love
I can feel it flowing away, flowing away, flowing away, flowing away

Just goin' through the motions
Goin' through the motions
Just goin' through the motions
Goin' through the motions

Your heart is not in it, baby
You're trying hard, but you're not foolin' me
Your heart is not in it, baby
A different person is lying here with me

Goin' through the motions
You're just goin' through the motions
Goin' through the motions
Just goin' through the motions

I can feel your love
Feel it flowing away, flowing away, flowing away, flowing away
I can feel your love, babe
Feel it flowing away, flowing away, flowing away, flowing away

I can feel your love
I can feel it flowing away, flowing away, flowing away, flowing away
I can feel your love, baby
Flowing away, flowing away, flowing away, flowing away

Goin' through the motions
Just goin' through the motions
Goin' through the motions
Goin' through the motions

I can feel your love
Feel it flowing away, flowing away, flowing away, flowing away
I can feel your love, baby
I can feel it flowing away, flowing away, flowing away, flowing away

I can feel your love, baby
Flowing away, flowing away, flowing away, flowing away
Feel your love, baby
Flowing away, flowing away, flowing away, flowing away

I can feel your love, baby
Feel it flowing away, flowing away, flowing away, flowing away
I can feel your love, baby
Feel it flowing away, flowing away, flowing away, flowing away
