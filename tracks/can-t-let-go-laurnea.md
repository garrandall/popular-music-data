In the middle of the night
I tried to cry myself to sleep but I
Can't even close my eyes
Just thinkin bout you
What would I do without you?
Cause I wanna be there
Always there, and

Chorus
I, can't let go
Deep inside I wanna let it show
Cuz I know I gotta let you go
But i, don't even know
Don't wanna know what I'd do
If I were ever without you

Bending lies
Avoiding it for a while
But i, I can't hide it
The fact we need to be apart
I want so much to be with you
What am i, supposed to do?
When I looOOove you!

Chorus
I, can't let go
Deep inside I wanna let it show
Gotta let you go
But i, don't even know
Don't wanna know what I'd do
If I were ever without you

Chorus:
I can't let go(i can't let go, no no)
Wanna let it show (i wanna let it show)
Gotta let you go (go)
But I don't even know
Don't wanna know what I'd do
If I were ever without you

Shum dum dum no
Shum dum dum no
Shum dum dum no
Shum dum dum no

Baby won't you help me say
I always thought
This would be a perfect kind of love for me
But now I know it's plain to see
Things will work out just for me
But I need to know
Please let me know
If you're gonna be alright,(if you're gonna be alright)
Cuz I luhve you!, yea

Chorus:
I can't let go(i can't let go, no no)
Wanna let it show (i've got to let it show, yea, yea, yea)
Gotta let you go (oh no)
But I don't even know, (but I don't, know know know)
Don't wanna know what I'd do,(oh)
If I were ever without you, (baby)

Chorus:
I can't let go(i can't let go, I can't let go)
Wanna let it show (oh honey, don't you see the tears in my eyes?)
Gotta let you go (i've been crying)
But I don't even know
Don't wanna know what I'd do
If I were ever without you
