Would you like to live in Houston
Where the cowboys come to town
Or maybe Pensacola
Where the sun shines all year 'round
Or even New York City
Where the city never sleeps
I'm offering you the option
Before you get in too deep

If you can anything else,
Baby, be good to yourself
You can find a nice place, have a good life
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm gonna be alright
You can make a new start,
You can see yourself clear
If you can do anything else, do it
But if you can't,
Baby, you can you stay right here

There's work up in Seattle,
If you don't mind the rain
San Diego to Savannah,
They'd all be glad you came
But life with me would always be
A roller coaster ride
You won't hurt my feelings,
Whatever you decide

If you can anything else,
Baby, be good to yourself
You can find a nice place, have a good life
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm gonna be alright
You can make a new start,
You can see yourself clear
If you can do anything else, do it
But if you can't,
Baby, you can you stay right here

This place might look real good right now,
But lookin' good don't last
But if you choose it, anyhow,
I'll give you all I have

If you can anything else,
Baby, be good to yourself
You can find a nice place, have a good life
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm gonna be alright
You can make a new start,
You can see yourself clear
If you can do anything else, do it
But if you can't,
Baby, you can you stay right here
