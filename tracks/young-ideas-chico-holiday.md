Oh, oh, oh, oh...

Now we're gonna make love
Well-a, well-a, well-a, well

Young ideas
Young ideas
Young ideas
Come, we're gonna make love
Well-a, well-a, well-a, well

Hug me close
Whisper low
I love you so
Yes we're gonna make love
Well-a, well-a, well-a, well

Young ideas

Young ideas
Come, we're gonna make love
Well-a, well-a, well-a, well

Diamond ring
Engagement ring
You're the prettiest thing
And I need your love

Making plans
Future plans
Hand in hand
And we're gonna make love

Oh, oh, oh, oh...

And we're gonna make love
Well-a, well-a, well-a, well

Wedding vows
Truest spouse
We're married now
And we're gonna make love
Well-a, well-a, well-a, well

You and me
Then a family
Maybe two or three
Yes, we're gonna make love
Well-a, well-a, well-a, well

Come, we're gonna make love

Oh, oh, oh, oh...
