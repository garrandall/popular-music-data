I think I'm going back to the things that I learned so well in my youth
I think I'm returning to those days when I was young enough to know the truth
Now there are no games to only pass the time
No more electric trains, no more trees to climb
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall the time when I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend
Now I think I've got a lot more than just my toys to lend
Now there's more to do than watch my sailboat glide
And every day can be a magic carpet ride
A little bit of courage is all we lack
So catch me if you can, I'm goin' back

Now there's more to do than watch my sailboat glide
But every day can be a magic carpet ride
A little bit of courage is all we lack
So catch me if you can, I'm goin' back
