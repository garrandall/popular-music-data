Stranger than the sunrise
Darker than the night
Fiercer than a rainstorm
This is man's delight
This is man's delight

Weaker than a moment
And hot as any fire
Blinder than the blind eye
This is man's desire
This is man's desire

I ran to a place in the open sea

Where I pledged
My life to the sun
It was good for a while
I could laugh, I could smile
But when I woke up one day
The sun had gone

So what of my meaning
What am I trying to say
What of my caution
I'm a man anyway
I'm a man anyway
