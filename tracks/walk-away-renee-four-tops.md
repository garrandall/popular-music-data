And when I see the sign that points one way
The lot we used to pass by every day

Just walk away, RenÃ©e
You won't see me follow you back home
The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same
You're not to blame

From deep inside the tears
I'm forced to cry
From deep inside the pain
That I chose to hide

Just walk away, RenÃ©e
You won't see me follow you back home
Now as the rain burns down upon my weary eyes
For me it cries

Just walk away, RenÃ©e
You won't see me follow you back home
Now as the rain burns down upon my weary eyes
For me it cries

Your name and mine inside
A heart on a wall
Still finds a way to haunt me
Though they're so small

Just walk away, RenÃ©e
You won't see me follow you back home
The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same
You're not to blame
