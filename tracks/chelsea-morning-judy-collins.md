I woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I heard
Was a song outside my window
The traffic wrote the words
It came ringing up like Christmas bells
Rapping up like pipes and drums

Oh, won't you stay we'll put on the day
And we'll wear it 'till the night comes

I woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I saw
Was the sun through yellow curtains
And a rainbow on my wall
Blue, red, green and gold to welcome you
Crimson crystal beads to beckon

Oh, won't you stay we'll put on the day
There's a sun show every second

Now the curtain opens on a portrait of today
And the streets are paved with passersby
Pigeons fly, and papers lie
Waiting to blow away

I woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I knew
There was milk and toast and honey
And a bowl of orange juice too
And the light poured in like butterscotch
Stuck to all my senses

Oh, won't you stay we'll put on the day
And we'll talk in present tenses

When the contain closes
And the rainbow runs away
I will bring you incense owls by night
By jewel light, by candlelight, if only you will stay
Oh my darling won't you wake up, it is a Chelsea morning
