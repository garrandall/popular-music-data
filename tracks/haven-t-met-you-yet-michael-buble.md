I'm not surprised, not everything lasts
I've broken my heart so many times I stopped keeping track
Talk myself in, I talk myself out
I get all worked up then I let myself down


I tried so very hard not to lose it
I came up with a million excuses
I thought I'd thought of every possibility


And I know some day that it’ll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you kid that I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet


I might have to wait, I'll never give up
I guess it's half timing and the other half's luck
Wherever you are, whenever it's right
You'll come out of nowhere and into my life


And I know that we can be so amazing
And baby your love is gonna change me
And now I can see every possibility


And somehow I know that it’ll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And promise you kid I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet


They say all’s fair in love and war
But I won’t need to fight it
We'll get it right and we'll be united


And I know that we can be so amazing
And being in your life is gonna change me
And now I can see every single possibility


And someday I know it'll all turn out
And I'll work to work it out
Promise you kid I'll give more than I get, than I get, than I get, than I get


Oh you know it'll all turn out
And you'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And promise you kid to give so much more than I get yeah
I just haven't met you yet


I just haven't met you yet
Oh promise you kid to give so much more than I get
I said love love love love love love love
I just haven't met you yet
Yeah, I just haven't met you yet
