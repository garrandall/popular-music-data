I got a baby that I call my Little Donna
Well, she knows just what I wanna
She's got a shape that’s really keener
And she come from Pasadena
Oh well, I love my Little Donna
Pretty little girl of mine

I have no problem with other guys
They seem to know that Little Donna's mine
And when we're on the Santa Barbara shore
I feel our love will be forever more
We love to go down to the Palisades
And hear the rhythm of the surfers’ waves
And as we listen to the melody
I really know that she's the girl for me

I got a baby that I call my little Donna
Well, she knows just what I wanna
She got a shape that's really keener
And she come from Pasadena
Oh well, I love my Little Donna
Pretty little girl of mine

Well, we were driving round Riviera
And we went up to the Sierras
Oh well, the fragrant flowers smelled so fine
And Donna said she was forever mine
One starry night we were near oceanside
And I asked Donna if she'd be my bride
And so we settled down by Mission Bay
And I will love her till our final day

I got a baby that I call my little Donna
Well, she knows just what I wanna
She got a shape that's really keener
And she come from Pasadena
Oh well, I love my Little Donna
Pretty little girl of mine
Pretty little girl of mine
Pretty little girl of mine
