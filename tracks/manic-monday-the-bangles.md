Six o'clock already I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissin' Valentino by a crystal blue Italian stream
And I can't be late 'cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days when you wish your bed was already made.

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my Funday
My I don't have to runday
It's just another manic Monday.

Have to catch an early train, got to be to work by nine
And if I had an air-o-plane, I still couldn't make it on time
'Cause it takes me so long just to figure out what I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train but the boss is already there.

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my Funday (oh-woe-oh-oh)
My I don't have to runday
It's just another manic Monday.

All of my nights why did my lover have to pick last night to get down (last night, last night)
Doesn't it matter that I have to feed the both of us, employment's down
He said to me in his quiet riot voice:
"C'mon feel the noise" (bum bum bum bummm)
Time, it goes so fast (when you're having fun).

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my Funday
My I don't have to runday
It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my funday
My I don't have to runday
It's just another manic Monday.
