Bill, I love you so, I always will
I look at you and see the passion eyes of May (eyes of May)
Oh, but am I ever gonna see my wedding day (wedding day)
I was on your side, Bill, when you were losing
I'd never scheme or lie, Bill, there's been no fooling
But kisses and love won't carry me till you marry me Bill

I love you so, I always will
And in your voice I hear a choir of carousels (carousels)
Oh, but am I ever gonna hear my wedding bells (wedding bells)
I was the one who came running when you were lonely
I haven't lived one day not loving you only
But kisses and love won't carry me till you marry me Bill

I love you so, I always will
And, though devotion rules my heart, I take no bows
Oh, but Bill you're never gonna take those wedding vows (wedding vows)
Oh, come on Bill (come on Bill)
Oh, come on Bill (come on Bill)

Come on and marry me, Bill
I got the wedding bell blues
Please marry me, Bill
I got the wedding bell blues
Wedding bell blues
Wedding bell blues

Yeah, yeah, marry me, Bill
I got the wedding bell blues
