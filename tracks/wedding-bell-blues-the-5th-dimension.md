Bill, I love you so, I always will
I look at you and see the passion eyes of May
Oh, but am I ever gonna see my wedding day

Oh, I was on your side Bill when you were losin'
I'd never scheme or lie Bill, there'd been no foolin'
But kisses and love won't carry me until you marry me Bill
I love you so, I always will

And in your voice I hear a choir of carousels
Ah, but am I ever gonna hear my wedding bells
I was the one who came runnin' when you were lonely
I haven't lived one day not lovin' you only

But kisses and love won't carry me until you marry me Bill
I love you so, I always will
And though devotion rules my heart I take no bows
Ah, but Bill you know I wanna take those wedding vows

Come on, Bill, come on, Bill
Kisses and love won't carry me until you marry me Bill
I love you so, I always will
Come on, Bill

Wont'cha marry me, Bill?
I love you so, I always will
Come on, Bill
Wont'cha marry me Bill
