No arms can ever hold you
Like these arms of mine

No arms can ever hold you
Like these arms of mine (like these arms of mine)
No heart can ever love you
Like this heart of mine (like this heart of mine)

My dreams can all come true
If you care for me
Ah, this feelin' that I feel
Was just meant to be

No lips can ever kiss you
Like these lips of mine (like these lips of mine)
No one can ever offer
What I offer you

My heart, my arms are yours
Till the end of time
No arms can ever hold you
Like these arms of mine

My heart, my arms are yours
Till the end of time
No arms can ever hold you
Like these arms of mine
