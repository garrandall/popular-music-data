You can have this dance with me
You can hold my hand and whisper
In my ear sweet words, that I
Love to hear

 Don't be shy, just take your time
I'd like to get to know you
I'd like to make you mine

I've been waiting, sitting here so patiently
For you to come over
And have this dance with me

 And my number is Beechwood 4-5789
You can call me up and have a date
Any old time



Beechwood 4-5789
You can call me up and have a date
Any old time

Beechwood 4-5789
You can call me up and have a date
Any old time
