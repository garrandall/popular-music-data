I had a one night stand with my best friend's baby sister
And to this day he still won't speak to me
I pawned my grandpa's old guitar in college
For a case of beer and a tank of gasoline

I took a swing at my old man one Christmas
I never dreamed that it would be his last
I wish mom had rung my neck when she caught me with those cigarettes
Which reminds me, I'm down to my last pack

If I had a dime for half the things I did
That didn't make no sense at all, I'd be living a little higher on the hog
If only I'd've known that later on down the road
I'd look back and not like what I see
I'd've changed a lot of things... Startin' with me

I called my brother everything I could think of
The night he wouldn't bail me out of jail
I lost a job most folks 'round here would die for
By laying out all night and raising hell

And I let a woman that I love slip through my fingers
Chalk another dumb move up to my foolish pride
I wasn't there standin' by the bed when the preacher bowed his head
With the family, the day my grandma died

If I had a dime for half the things I did
That didn't make no sense at all, I'd be living a little higher on the hog
If only I'd've known that later on down the road
I'd look back and not like what I see

Ohh, I'd've changed a lot of things... Startin' with me

If only I'd've known that later on down the road
I'd look back and not like what I see
Ohh, I'd've changed a lot of things... Startin' with me
Startin' with me...
