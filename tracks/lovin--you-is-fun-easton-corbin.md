Youâve got a cousin whoâs telling you somethinâ
That doesnât have nothinâ to do with the lovinâ that weâre in, baby
I hear sheâs sayinâ this game weâre playinâ should be complicated
If you wonât, Iâll say it, I think sheâs crazy, cause

Love donât have to be a bunch of drama
A bunch of knock-down, drag-outs, crying in the rain
Itâs all right to keep it light now mama, donât you think
Weâre having such a good time together and itâs only just begun
My heartâs never smiled so hard
Baby, lovinâ you is fun
Itâs fun

Iâm walking around all over this town, ten feet off the ground
So happy I found you, baby, I love it
Thereâs no self-help book on your shelf, you know too well
Theyâre trying to sell you somethinâ for nothinâ, cause

Love donât have to be a bunch of drama
A bunch of knock-down, drag-outs, crying in the rain
Itâs all right to keep it light now mama, donât you think
Weâre having such a good time together and itâs only just begun
My heartâs never smiled so hard
Baby, lovinâ you is fun

Love donât have to be a bunch of drama
A bunch of knock-down, drag-outs, crying in the rain
Itâs all right to keep it light now mama, donât you think
Weâre having such a good time together and itâs only just begun
My heartâs never smiled so hard
Baby, lovinâ you is fun

This ole heartâs never smiled so hard
Lovinâ you is fun
Yeah itâs fun
Yeah itâs fun
Lovinâ you is fun
