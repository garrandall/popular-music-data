Smiling faces sometimes pretend to be your friend
Smiling faces show no traces of the evil that lurks within
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
They don't tell the truth, uh
Smiling faces, smiling faces
Tell lies and I got proof

The truth is in the eyes
Cause the eyes don't lie, amen
Remember a smile is just
A frown turned upside down
My friend, ah-ha, so give me when I tell you
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
They don't tell the truth, listen
Smiling faces, smiling faces
Tell lies and I got proof
Beware of the handshake
That hides the snake
I'm telling you of the pat on the back
It just might hold you back
Jealousy (jealousy)
Misery (misery)
Envy

You can't see behind smiling faces
Smiling faces sometimes they don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces
Tell lies and I got proof

Yeah-eh, yeah

Um
Eh
Two, three, eh

Smiling faces (smiling)
Show no traces (show)
Of the evil that lurks within (oh ohh)

Smiling faces (smiling faces)
Smiling faces tell lies (say that lie)
They don't tell the truth

Smiling faces (smiling faces)
Smiling faces tell lies (tell lies)
And I got proof (I got proof)

Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
They don't tell the truth

Listen
Smiling faces, smiling faces
Tell lies and I got proof

Smiling faces, smiling faces...
