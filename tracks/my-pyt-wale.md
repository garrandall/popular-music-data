She a couple couple, couple years younger
But she badder than a motherfucker
Ass fatter than a motherfucker
She got her own she don't need no ticket
She get it yeah she got it so you know I'm going to get it
You my M-Y-P-Y-T

And I'll do anything for her
I want to love you
Pretty young thing
You need some loving
From a real one
I want to love you
Pretty young thing
You need some loving
And I'm a real one


I'm sayin' hold up what's up what it do
I ain't trying to do too much but come through
Cartier frames too much but it's cool
The only thing strange they won't get off you
Say you want a rider
Well I got a ticket
And later we can hide out
You trying to get Missing
Now I'm all up in your mind now
Cool , that's how I get you
But you can't figure mine out
See I'm quite different
A James Bond nigga with a Saint Laurent fetish
And thank god I never had a baby mother either
Snapchat shortie
Flash that for me
Clap back from niggas like that's not for you
Give her 50 feet fell in love in a week
She penetrating my mind
I penetrate that physique
Bitches I would delete
Digging our chemistry
No limit to me and she
Come give me kiss on the cheek
Pretty Thang


She a couple couple couple years younger
But she badder than a motherfucker
Ass fatter than a motherfucker
She got her own she don't need no ticket

This ones for you
Hold the set down
This ones for you
Suppose to get the crown
Pretty young girl
Toast for you and I
This ones for you
I just wanna see you shine
Nothing make a man feel better than a woman
Queen with the crown but for now it's a Birkin
Theres a few things that for certain
My lady
We can make war or make babies
I'm a rider and a ticket
That's comes with good planning and channeling your ambition
I know this fat nigga that properly seen the vision
He use to move keys he Khaled a little different
Another one
Another one
Another one
When she put it down on me I put them numbers up (facts)
I love that jawn
She 21
Ok she old enough to drink might gotta be my lunch
Stay low and build with her
Coachella chill with her
I got colorful lyrics
We twinning
Cause every other color Kylie come out wit I get them
Real nigga what
