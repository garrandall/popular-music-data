And if you don't like that, then send it right back
But I just gotta say, I just gotta say

Come get get get it, the business, I hi hit it, whose is it
The Benz with the windows tinted, oh I get dirty south
Showing, like them grown men, Goose, Patron, Gin
Let let me go in, sexy moaning, ca catch me jonesin
Let no not ever with this little mama off schedule
Got me achy, call me papi, hot as saki, fly as feathers

Deserve an encore, the definition of a shone

My sister swagger should tell it more than anything can vouch
Little mama you are what's inside ghetto, fine I'll make you proud
So stuntalicious, I love it, lets at least work something out
Miss thing, million dollar game, coke bottle frame
Make my wall of fame let me know your name
I control the rain I could make it better, matter of fact

All because you hot as ever, if you may lady,

You're a keeper, touch of diva, give me a fever
If I could freak ya, give me the word and I'll be along
