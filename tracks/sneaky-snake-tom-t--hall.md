Boys and girls take warning, if you go near the lake
Keep your eyes wide open, and look for sneaky snake
Now maybe you won't see him, and maybe you won't hear
But he'll sneak up behind you, and drink all of your root beer

And then sneaky snake goes dancing, wigglin' and a-hissin'
Sneaky snake goes dancin', a-gigglin' and a-kissin'
I don't like old sneaky snake; he laughs too much you see
When he goes wigglin' through the grass, it tickles his underneath

Well, sneaky snake drinks root beer, and he just makes me sick
When he is not dancing, he looks just like a stick
he doesn't have any arms or legs, you cannot see his ears
And while we are not lookin', he's stealin' all of our root beer

And then sneaky snake goes dancing, wigglin' and a-hissin'
Sneaky snake goes dancin', a-gigglin' and a-kissin'
I don't like old sneaky snake; he laughs too much you see
When he goes wigglin' through the grass, it tickles his underneath
