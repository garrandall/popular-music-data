Jealous, jealous (We The Best Music)
Oh, don't want us together-gether (Another one)
You need somebody babe, you need somebody babe (DJ Khaled)

I pick you up in my ride
Make sure you waiting outside when I pull up
I told my niggas I can't slide
Just to be right by your side
I could've been anywhere, but I'm right here
I want you all to myself, I grab your hips and I
Tell you you're the one for me, tell you I got all I need
'Cause I want your body, yeah, yeah
All over my body
And I know that they hate it (They say I'm no good)
But I know that they watchin', no, no, no

Girl, I can tell you need some love in your life (Let's ride)
And I'm the one, don't let no one change your mind (Fuck what they say)
(Fuck 'em)
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Let's go)
Don't want us together-gether-gether
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous
Don't want us together-gether-gether
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous
Don't want us together-gether-gether
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous
Don't want us together-gether-gether

You mad or you jealous
You sad or you settle
The brighter the rainbow, the badder the weather
The good with the bad, but the badder the better
Bring my sand to the beach nigga and to the desert
We fell from the heavens, we landed like feathers
The rose in the rubble, keep your nose out of petals
Your hoes know my schedule and my hoes know I'm special
They know not to question, bitch, you know I'm not Alexa
She post a pic of me and her from off her iPad
You know them hoes don't like that, where the likes at
Jealousy is a disease, you can die mad
Tunechi, Sean, C.B., Khaled hi there (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Girl, I can tell you need some love in your life (Let's ride)
And I'm the one, don't let no one change your mind (Fuck what they say)
(Fuck 'em)
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Let's go)
Don't want us together-gether-gether
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous
Don't want us together-gether-gether
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous
Don't want us together-gether-gether
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous
Don't want us together-gether-gether

Dog, it's these jealous-ass hoes I can't relate to
The type to follow you but hardly follow through
You say I'm on your mind, I'm wondering why I'm not on you
Girl, you're fresh out the shower
Towel around your head like you're Erykah Badu
It's lookin' like a spa day
I rearrange your chakras, listenin' to Sade
Let's take a road trip and get high on the highway
Migrate, spend time laid back, watch the sky change
Whoa
And I hear the jealousy, but look, I never listen
The quickest way to let something die is lack of attention
And you got it all, you lookin' good as my intentions
We on an ascension, straight up

Girl, I can tell you need some love in your life (Let's ride)
And I'm the one, don't let no one change your mind (Fuck what they say)
(Fuck 'em)
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Let's go)
Don't want us together-gether-gether
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous
Don't want us together-gether-gether
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous
Don't want us together-gether-gether
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous
Don't want us together-gether-gether

These boys scared I'ma take they chick (They chick)
Must be the money, 'cause a young boy rich (Real rich)
You could drop a dime, but I make it make sense
Girl, you coming home with me
You the last number on my call list (Call list)
Pull up on me, girl, let's get lit (Get lit)
I think I hit a lick
I think I hit a lick, yeah (Another one)

Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Let's go)
Don't want us together-gether-gether
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous
Don't want us together-gether-gether
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous
Don't want us together-gether-gether
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous
Don't want us together-gether-gether

We The Best Music
They jealous
They don't want us together
They played themselves
Baby, I got an idea
Let's be together forever (Forever)
