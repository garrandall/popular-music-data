Well my baby wants mansion, diamond ring
Big fine car and everything
But I'm a natural born lover

Hey, I'm a natural born lover
Well now tell me baby
Which one of us would you rather

Well now all those luxuries don't mean a thing
You should get yourself a real good man
And I'm a real gone lover
Hey, I'm a natural born lover
Well now tell me baby
Which one of us would you rather

I ain't got no mansion, no diamond ring
Big fine car, I don't have a thing
But I'm a natural born lover
Hey, I'm a real good lover
Well now tell me baby
Which one of us would you rather
