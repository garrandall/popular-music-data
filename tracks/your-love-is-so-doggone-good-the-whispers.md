Take me in your arms
And never let me go
Whisper to me softly
While the moon is low
Hold me close and tell me
What I wanna know
Say it to me gently
Let the sweet talk flow
Come a little closer
Make love to me

Kiss me once again
Before we say good-night
Take me in your loving arms
And squeeze me tight
Put me in a mood
So I can dream all night
Everybody's sleeping
So it's quite all right
Come a little closer
Make love to me

When you're near
So help me, dear
Chills run
Up and down my spine
Don't you know
I love you so
I won't be happy
Till you're mine
When I'm in your arms
You give my heart a treat
Everything about you
So doggone sweet
Every time we kiss
You make my life complete
Baby don't you know
You swept me off my feet
Now's it's time to tell you
Make love to me

When you're near
So help me, dear
Chills run
Up and down my spine
Don't you know
I love you so
I won't be happy
Till you're mine
When I'm in your arms
You give my heart a treat
Everything about you
So doggone sweet
Every time we kiss
You make my life complete
Baby don't you know
You swept me off my feet
Now's it's time to tell you
Make love to me
