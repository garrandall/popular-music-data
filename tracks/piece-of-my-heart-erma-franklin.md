Didn't I make you feel
Like you were the only man?
Didn't I give you everything that a woman possibly can?
(Ohhhh oh oh)


But with all the love I give you
It's never enough
But I'm gonna show you, baby
That a woman can be tough
So come on
Come on
Come on
Come on


And
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
(Break it!)
Break another little bit of my heart now, honey
(Have a)
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
(You know you got it if it makes you feel good)


You're out on the streets (looking good)
And you know deep down in your heart that it ain't right
And oh you never never hear me when I cry at night
Ohhhhhhhh


I tell myself
That I can't stand the pain
But when you hold me in your arms
I'll say it again
So come on
Come on
Come on
Come on


And take it
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Heyyyy!
(Break it!)
Break another little bit of my heart now, baby
You can
(Have a)
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
(You know you got it if it makes you feel good)


Hey heyyyyy!
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Ohhhh
(Break it!)
Break another little bit of my heart now, honey
Heyyyyyy!
(Have a)
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby
Come on
(Take it!)
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby
