Ooh, ah 
Come on, come on, come on, come on 

Didnât I make you feel like you were the only one, yeah 
Didnât I give you nearly everything 
That a man possibly could 
Honey, you know I did 
And each time I tell myself that 
Well, I think I had enough 
Iâm gonna show you, baby 
How a man sure can be tough 
I want you to 

Come on, come on, come on, come on and 
Take it 
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby 
Oh, break it 
Break another little bit of my heart 
Now, baby, baby, baby 
Oh, have a 
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby 

You know you got it 
If it makes you feel good 
Oh, yes indeed 
Oh, yes indeed 

Yeah, youâre out on the streets lookinâ good 
And baby, deep down in your heart 
I guess you know that it ainât right 
Never, never, never hear me when I cry at night 
Yeah, I cry all the time 
But each time I tell myself that 
Well, I canât stand the pain 
But when you hold me in your arms, baby 
Iâll sing it once again 
Oh, wonât you 

Come on, come on, come on, come on and 
Take it 
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby 
Oh, break it 
Break another little bit of my heart 
Now, baby, baby, baby 
Oh, have a 
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby 

You know you got it, child 
If it makes you feel good, yeah 

Come on, come on, come on, come on and 
Take it 
Take another little piece of my heart now, baby 
Oh, break it 
Break another little bit of my heart 
Now, baby, baby, baby 
Oh, have a 
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby 

You know you got it, oh, yeah, yeah 

Take another little piece of my heart now, baby 
Oh, break it 
Break another little bit of my heart 
Now baby, baby, baby 
Oh, have a 
Have another little piece of my heart now, baby 
You know you got it 
If it makes you feel good, yeah
