All we need is a July hot Saturday night
A couple cans on cool and the needle on full and a countryside
Yeah, a hot little playlist of your favorite songs
And when I get you climbing up in the cab of this truck
Yeah you know it's on, know it's on

Show you a side of these two lanes you've never seen
Heatin' it up behind the high beams
Oh, baby you and me, just runnin' down crazy
Flyin' high, living careless, on the edge of wild and reckless
Hold on tight, I'm 'bout to show you one hell of a night

So gimme that aww yeah, and take me there look
I'm a sucker for your kiss, wanna steal 'em from your lips baby, like a crook
Foot heavy on the floorboard, everywhere we go
I'm talking once in a lifetime, blowin' your mind
Burnin' down these back roads

Show you a side of these two lanes you've never seen
Heatin' it up behind the high beams
Oh, baby you and me, just runnin' down crazy
Flyin' high, livin' careless, on the edge of wild and reckless
Hold on tight, I'm 'bout to show you one hell of a night

So gimme that aww yeah, and I'll give you that all night
Girl, gimme that "let's go", and I'll give you that good good time

Show you a side of these two lanes you've never seen
Heatin' it up behind a high beams
Oh, baby you and me, just runnin' down crazy
Flyin' high, livin' careless, on the edge of wild and reckless
Hold on tight, I'm 'bout to show you one hell of a night
Yeah, a once in a lifetime night
Mmm girl, if you're down to ride one hell of a night
I'm 'bout to show you one hell of a night
