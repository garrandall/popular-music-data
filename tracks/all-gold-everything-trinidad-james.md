Yeah this shit Explainsound like 007 on N64 and shit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
James

Gold all in my chain, gold all in my ring
Gold all in my watch
Don't believe me, just watch
Nigga nigga nigga
Don't believe me, just watch
Don't believe me, just watch
Nigga nigga nigga
Don't believe me, just watch
Don't believe me, just watch
Gold all in my chain, gold all in my ring
Gold all in my watch, don't believe me just watch

This ain't for no fuck nigga
If you a real nigga then fuck with me
This one for the hood niggas
Hipster bitches that shop at Lenox
Dark skinned, light skinned, Asian and White women
Hypebeasts we know aboutchea'
Don't buy shoes unless they popula'
For the hoes, my nigga
That's pussy popping that Magic City
Got that strong, my nigga
Then come match that shit with me
Smoking mid, my nigga
Then don't pass that shit to me
This one for my niggas
And bitches bout that money, Cash Out
Gotta love, Chesire Bridge
Them bad hoes at Onyx
I don't fuck with no snitches
So don't tell me who telling
This one for them colleges
Them bad hoes at Spelman
Shout out to them freshmen
On Instagram straight flexin'
Popped a molly, I'm sweating woo
Popped a molly, I'm sweating woo
Momma always told me, boy count your blessings
In God I Trust, so I kept counting them Franklins
I'm too fly, you know this
Lemme give your ass a checklist
One gold watch, two gold chains
Six gold rings, it's nothing, God Dayum
OG Jordans, them high socks
No shirt on, I'm stunting, okay
And this song for them fuck niggas
Who hating on you this summer, fuck em
Talk shit behind your back
But won't say shit in public, fuck em

Gold all in my chain, gold all in my ring
Gold all in my watch
Don't believe me, just watch
Nigga nigga nigga
Don't believe me, just watch
Don't believe me, just watch
Nigga nigga nigga
Don't believe me, just watch
Don't believe me, just watch
Gold all in my chain, gold all in my ring
Gold all in my watch, don't believe me just watch
