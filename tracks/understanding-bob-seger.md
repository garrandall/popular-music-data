It seems like only yesterday
I didn't have a clue
I stood alone not knowing where to turn
Now suddenly I look around
Everything looks new
I don't know why, but I think I'm startin' to learn
They call it understanding
A willingness to grow

I'm finally understanding
There's so much I can know
Until the day you came along
I used to just get lost
I only heard the things I wanted to hear
Always seemed like no one cared
Then you took the time
And now I look and everything seems clear
You've got me understanding
You've really helped me see

I'm finally understanding
It's meant so much to me
You've got me understanding
You've given me some pride
I'm finally understanding
You're really on my side

You're really on my side
Yeah, yeah

Got me understanding
Understanding
You've got me understanding
Oh yeah
Understanding
Understanding
You've got me understanding

For the first time
You've got me understanding
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You've got me understanding
