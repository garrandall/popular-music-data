Oh, the good life, full of fun
Seems to be the ideal
Mm, the good life lets you hide
All the sadness you feel


You won't really fall in love
For you can't take the chance
So please be honest with yourself
Don't try to fake romance


It's the good life to be free
And explore the unknown
Like the heartaches when you learn
You must face them alone


Please remember, I still want you
And in case you wonder why
Well, just wake up
Kiss the good life, goodbye
