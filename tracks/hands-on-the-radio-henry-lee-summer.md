Yeah...

When everything's getting me down
Oh, yeah, you seem to always be around
Lift me up and drive my blues away
Make it feel just like the good old days

I'm closing my eyes and I
Can feel your rock and roll

I got my hands on the radio, oh, oh
I got my hands on the radio

Well, I tried the movies
They made me feel okay, yeah
It's only you who makes
The empty go away, yeah, yeah

Electricity through my bones
Feel it lessen in my headphones
I need it now
More than you'll ever know

I got my hands on the radio, yeah
I got my hands on the radio

The newspaper
It always leaves me cold
The TV just don't ? to my soul

Yeah, yeah, yeah
I got my hands on the radio, oh, oh
I got my hands on the radio
Make me feel so good

I got my hands on the radio, oh, oh
I got my hands on the ra
Hands on the ra, hands on the radio

(Hands on the radio)
(Hands on the radio)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
(Hands on the radio)
