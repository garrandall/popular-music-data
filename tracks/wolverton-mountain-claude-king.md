They say don't go on Wolverton Mountain
If you're looking for a wife
Cause Clifton Clowers has a pretty young daughter
He's mighty handy with a gun and a knife

Her tender lips are sweeter than honey
And Wolverton Mountain protects her there
The bears and the birds tell Clifton Clowers
If a stranger should enter there

All of my dreams are on Wolverton Mountain
I want his daughter for my wife
I'll take my chances and climb that mountain
Though Clifton Clowers, he might take my life

Her tender lips are sweeter than honey
And Wolverton Mountain protects her there
The bears and the birds tell Clifton Clowers
If a stranger should wander there

I'm going up on Wolverton Mountain
It's too lonesome down here below
It's just not right to hide his daughter
From the one who loves her so

Her tender lips are sweeter than honey
And Wolverton Mountain protects her there
The bears and the birds tell Clifton Clowers
If a stranger should wander there

I don't care about Clifton Clowers
I'm gonna climb up on his mountain
I'm gonna take the girl I love

I don't care about Clifton Clowers
I'm a gonna climb up on that mountain
And I'll get the one I love
