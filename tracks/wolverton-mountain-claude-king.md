Now they say don't go on Wolverton Mountain 
If you're looking for a wife
Cause Clifton Clovers has got a pretty young daughter
And he's mighty handy with a gun and a knife

Her tender lips are sweeter than honey 
And Wolverton Mountain protects her there
The bears and the birds tell Clifton Clovers 
If a stranger should wander there

All of my dreams are on Wolverton Mountain 
I want his daughter for my wife
I'll take my chances and I'll climb his mountain
Though Clifton Clovers he may take my life

Her tender lips are sweeter than honey 
And Wolverton Mountain protects her there
The bears and the birds tell Clifton Clovers 
If a stranger should wander there

I'm goin' up on Wolverton Mountain 
'Cause it's too lonesome down here below
It's just ain't right to hide his daughter 
From the one that loves her so

Her tender lips are sweeter than honey 
And Wolverton Mountain protects her there
The bears and the birds tell Clifton Clovers 
If a stranger should wander there

I don't care about Clifton Clovers 
I'm gonna climb up on that mountain
I wanna just the one I love 
I don't care about Clifton Clovers
I'm gonna climb up on that mountain
