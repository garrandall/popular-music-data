Ain't got no trouble in my life
No foolish dream to make me cry
I'm never frightened or worried
I know I'll always get by
I heat up
I cool down
When something gets in my way I go round it
Don't let life get me down
Gonna take it the way that I found it


I got the music in me
I got the music in me
I got the music in me

They say that life is a circle
But that ain't the way that I found it
Gonna move in a straight line
Keeping my feet firmly on the ground
I heat up
I cool down
I got words in my head so I say them
Don't let life get me down
Catch a hold of my blues, gonna play them



Feel funky
Feel good
Gonna tell ya
I'm in the neighborhood
Gonna fly like a bird on the wing
Hold on to your hat honey
Sing, sing, sing, sing
Heat up, cool down
I got words in my head so I say them
Don't let life get me down
Catch a hold of my blues, gonna play them



Ain't got no trouble in my life
No foolish dream to make me cry
I'm never frightened I'm never worried
I know, I know I'll always get by

(Extended Chorus)
