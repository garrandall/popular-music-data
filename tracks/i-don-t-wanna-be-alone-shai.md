Lady, I hope we can be together soon
Lately, I'm waking up every day at noon
And maybe, all the meaning is just a minute or two
With you, alone with you
And I know we said we wouldn't
Ever overcrowd each other
But now that we are lovers
I just want you here with me

I don't wanna be alone tonight
I don't wanna be alone 'cuz I don't feel like it's right
I don't wanna be alone, tonight
I want you to come, come and be with me
Let's discover ecstasy

Honey, don't worry you're all I'm thinking of
Funny, how silly we get when we're in love
Money can never be worth a minute or two
With you, alone with you
I know we said we wouldn't
Ever overcrowd each other
But now that we are lovers
I want you here with me

I don't wanna be alone tonight
I don't wanna be alone 'cuz I don't feel like it's right
I don't wanna be alone, tonight
(Don't wanna be alone, baby)
I want you to come, come and be with me
(Oh baby)
Let's discover ecstasy

Sometime, when I be working hard all day
I can't seem to get you out my mind
And my heart has really nothing left to see
I think I'm in love

I don't wanna be alone tonight
I don't wanna be alone 'cuz I don't feel like it's right
I don't wanna be alone, tonight, oh baby
I want you to come, come and be with me
(Sure baby)
Let's discover ecstasy
I don't want to be alone, to be alone
I don't want to be alone, to be alone
I don't want to be alone, to be alone
I want you to come, come and be with me
Let's discover ecstasy
I don't wanna be alone tonight
I don't wanna be alone 'cuz I don't feel like it's right
I don't want, want to be alone, tonight
I want you to come, come, oh
I don't wanna be alone tonight
I don't wanna be alone 'cuz I don't feel like it's right
