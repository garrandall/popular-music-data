If you want it, better come and get it
I'll be so glad to see you wit' it
My love, it's a lovey dovey kinda lovin'
And if you choose it, don't you misuse it
If you do, you're sure gonna lose it
My love, a smoothie groovy kinda lovin'

I've been savin' myself for a long time
Waitin' for the right girl to come my way
I've got the type of lovin' for someone that's gonna get
Groovier, smoothier, lovelier day by day
And if you can dig it, don't act livid
Baby, come on strong, baby get with it
My love, it's a mellow yellow kinda lovin'
My love, it's so tight and outta sight, alright

Ah, hah
And if you choose it, don't you misuse it
If you do, you're sure gonna lose it
My love, it's a lovey dovey kinda lovin'
My love, it's a mellow yellow kinda lovin'

Get it, get it, get it, get it, my love
Come on and get it, get it, get it, get it, my love
Come on and get it, get it, get it, get it
