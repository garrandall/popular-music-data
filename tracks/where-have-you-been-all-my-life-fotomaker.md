It used to be
My life was like a puzzle in a million pieces
And it seemed
My purpose and my destiny were mysteries then

Girl you came
Into my life
And you brought my heart a one way ticket
Straight to paradise

And just where have you been all my life?
Tell me where have you been all my life?
Girl just where have you been all my life?

Once I believed
My life was like a story book of empty pages
But now I see
All the years I spent in waiting were preparing me for you

And it's true
Love can make someone brand new
'Cause I feel just like a newborn child
Whenever I'm with you

And just where have you been all my life?
Tell me where have you been all my life?

All my life I've been waiting
All my life I've been waiting
All my life I've been waiting
Just for you

Where were you all my life?

All my life I've been waiting
All my life I've been waiting
All my life I've been waiting
Just for you

Where were you all my life?
Tell me where have you been all my life?
Girl just where have you been all my life?
Tell me where have you been all my life?
Girl just where have you been all my life?
