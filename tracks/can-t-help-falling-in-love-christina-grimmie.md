Wise men say only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay? Would it be a sin?
If I can’t help falling in love with you


Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be


Take my hand, take my whole life, too
For I can't help falling in love with you


Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be


Take my hand, take my whole life, too
For I can't help falling in love with you
For I can’t help falling in love with you
