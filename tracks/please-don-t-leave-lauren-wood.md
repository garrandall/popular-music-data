Please Don't Leave
Lauren Wood
Backing vocals: Michael McDonald
(Lauren Wood)

Oh, you have won
Take my heart
I think about you night and day
Am I wrong in this game
Sometimes you seem so far away
And I'm longing for your touch

Darlin' don't leave me this way
Darlin' don't leave me at all

Ohyou're here
And you're there, everywhere
But I never know just where you're at
Do your eyes tell me lies
I thought that they were saying that
You were longing for my touch

Darlin' don't leave me this way
Darlin' don't leave me at all

You are the sweetest thing I found
In New York City (sweetest thing I found)
You are the sweetest thing I found
In my life
You are the sweetest thing
I really think you're pretty (sweetest thing I found)
You are the finest thing that's happened to my life

Oh, you have won
Take my heart
I think about you night and day
Am I wrong (am I wrong) in this game
Sometimes you seem so far away
And I'm longing for your touch

Darlin' don't leave me (don't leave me) this way
Darlin' don't leave me at all

(Instrumental break)

Please don't leave me now

Darlin' don't leave me (don't leave me) this way
Darlin' don't leave me at all
Don't leave me oh, don't leave me
Darlin', Darlin'
Please don't leave me
Darlin' don't leave me at all
Ah, ha ah, ha
(Repeat and fade)
