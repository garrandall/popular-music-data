Lies, lies
Your telling me that you'll be true
Lies, lies
That's all I get from you
Tears, tears
I shed a million tears for you
Tears, tears
And now you're loving someone new
Someday I'm gonna be happy
But I don't know when just now
Lies, breakin' my heart

You think that you're such a smart girl
And I'll believe what you say
But who do you think you are girl
To lead me on this way, hey
Lies, lies
I can't believe a word you say
Lies, lies
I'm gonna make you sad someday
Someday you're gonna be lonely
But you won't find me around
Lies, breakin' my heart

Someday I'm gonna be happy
But I don't know when just now
Lies, breakin' my heart
You think that you're such a smart girl
And I'll believe what you say
But who do you think you are girl
To lead me on this way, hey
Lies, lies
I can't believe a word you say
Lies, lies
I'm gonna make you sad someday
Someday you're gonna be lonely
But you won't find me around
Lies, breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart
