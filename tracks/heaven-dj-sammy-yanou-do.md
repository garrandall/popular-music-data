Baby, you're all that I want
When you're lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe
We're in heaven
We're in heaven!


Oh, thinking about our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free
Now nothing can take you away from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now
You keep me coming back for more


Baby, you're all that I want
When you're lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe
We're in Heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven (We're in heaven)


Now, nothing could change what you mean to me
There's a lot that I could say
But just hold me now
'Cause our love will light the way


Baby, you're all that I want
When you're lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe
We're in Heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven (Heaven)


Now our dreams are coming true
Through the good times and the bad
I'll be standing there by you (We're in heaven)


Love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven!


Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh
We're in heaven!
