Oh, hey
Yeah, it's Breezy
Yeah, yeah, yeah


Pulled up on your bitch, tell your man I'm sorry
Hundred on my wrist, jumpin' out the 'rari
Oh she hit the splits, she know how to party
When I'm with my clique, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party


Bitches dancin' naked in my livin' room
She straight out of college, just turned 22
Girl, get your money up, I ain't even mad at you
Got you all on me, makin' these niggas catchin' attitudes
Tell 'em don't start it, my niggas retarded
Fuck the judge and the sentence, huh, I got a good lawyer
I got a few girls on the way, baby girl, you ain't leavin'
It's my birthday with the cake, fuck it up, then let me eat it


Pulled up on your bitch, tell your man I'm sorry
Hundred on my wrist, jumpin' out the 'rari
Oh she hit the splits, she know how to party
When I'm with my clique, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party


Yeah, I just got the ring, I think I deserve a toast
Shout out to my team, we be out there doin' the most
Girl, come to my place, but don't bring no clothes
Let's be dirty babe, baby, drop it low
Pop rubber bands all on her ass, baby been eating her wheaties
All in the back, dishin' the cash, make me if you need it
I got a few girls on the way, baby girl, you ain't leavin'
It's my birthday with the cake, lick it all, let me eat it


Pulled up on your bitch, tell your man I'm sorry
Hundred on my wrist, jumpin' out the 'rari
Oh she hit the splits, she know how to party
When I'm with my clique, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party


It's party, party, party like a nigga just got out of jail
Flyin' in my 'rari like a bat that just flew outta hell
I'm from the east of ATL, but ballin' in the Cali hills
Lil mama booty boomin', that bitch movin' and she standin' still
I know these bitches choosin' me, but I got 80 on me still
I'm tryna fuck, who tryna chill? 'Cause I'm just tryna pay some bills
I'm multi millionare LaFlare, this watch here cost a quarter M
Just look at me and look at them, I smashed her on my first attempt
Like Scarface bitch, the world is mine, you should read the blimp
So either you gon' take a ride, or you gon' stay with him
'Cause I got places I can be, I get yo ass on the scene
Gucci, CB VIP, so fuck them niggas, look at me, Wop


Pull up on your bitch, tell your man I'm sorry
Hundred on my wrist, jumpin' out the 'rari
Oh she hit the splits, she know how to party
When I'm with my clique, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party
