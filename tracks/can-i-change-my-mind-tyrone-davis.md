She didn't bat an eye, as I packed my bags to leave
I thought she would cry, or sit around my room and grieve
But oh the girl she fooled me this time
Acting like I was the last thing on her mind
Now I'd like to start all over again
I just want to change my mind

As I took those steps, toward that open door
Knowing all the time, oh Lord I just didn't wanna go
She didn't give me no sign
Nothing that would make me wanna change my mind
And I would like to start all over again
Baby, can I change my mind
Cause I would like to change my mind

(You know, I was confused, sitting here by myself thinking,
watching you walk to the door and walk away,
what was I supposed to say "change your mind")

Oh I've played my game so many times before
But people let me tell y'all, that I never reached the door
Oh the wind it is high tonight
I keep lookin' for my baby but she's not in sight
And I would like to start all over again

Baby can I change my mind
Cause I would like to start all over again
Baby can I change my...my mind
Cause I would like to start all over again with you girl
