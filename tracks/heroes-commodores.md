Lookin' back through time we are in debt to the leaders
Angels of mercy everyone
Good folks who believe there is no good and evil
Fought long and hard until the battles are were won

Heroes make the sun rise in the mornin'
Heroes make the moon shine bright at night
Heroes make our lives a little stronger
In the soul of everyone he can be found

Give us an anchor or a rock to lean on
A captain to take us through the storm
What makes a soldier ride alone into battle
Can anybody tell me where he's coming from

He's that stranger on the street
He's that child who's at your feet
Searching for freedom and justice
You've seen him time and again, you know they only fight to win
They're the challengers evil and I'm glad we know them

Heroes make the sun rise in the mornin'
Heroes make the moon shine bright at night
Heroes make our lives a little stronger
All our fears go away when he's around

Ooh...
Ooh...
Ooh...ooh...yeah

Whoa, heroes make our lives a little stronger
If you look you'll surely see there's you and me

Ooh, heroes
I played on people
