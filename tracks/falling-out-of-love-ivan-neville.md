Don't know why it seems like a long,
Long time
Since I've been on the move
I'm just tryin' to find my way
Don't know my name
Livin' day to day

Just a little boy who wants to have his way
I just can't keep still, and I'm
Falling out of love
Falling out of love

Sometimes it feels like I'm running out
Of time
Sand slippin' through my fingers
Like rivers through my mind

On the corner hangin' with the boys
I always will be
Falling out of love
Falling out of love
In and out of love
Out of love

Just foolin' around, can't slow down
Shoulda listened to what my Daddy said
Just wanna be cool, another fool
I can't keep still, and I'm

Feelin' kinda blue, my eyes are red
But something keeps telling me
That I know just what's gonna become
Of this little boy inside this heart of mine
I keep on falling out of love
Falling out of love

Just another child with a story to tell
I can't keep still, and I'm
Falling out of love
Falling out of love

Just enough time to live my life
I can't keep still, and I'm
Falling out of love
Falling out of love
In and out of love
