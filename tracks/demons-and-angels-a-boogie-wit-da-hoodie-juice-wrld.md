Huh, woke up in a new car
Chopper on my hip, it shoot a movie like a porn star, uh
I might fuck a porn star, uh
Woke up in Mercedes, yeah, let's ride up in a foreign car


Don't get on my bad side, I'm dangerous
Demons and angels hang with us
Treat it like a phone, baby, hang it up, uh
Throw your side up, go 'head, bang it up
Don't fuck with me, no, I'm dangerous, uh
I'm from where they hang 'em, oh
Throw your side up, go 'head, bang it up
Throw your side up, go 'head, bang it up


Don't gangbang when this shit get dangerous
I'm from the West Side, know not to play with us, yeah
If you thinkin' that it's sweet, it's not okay with us
Right now I'm in the A, we got the K with us (Bang)
All my chains heavy, and they bright as fuck
She only give me head 'cause she don't like to fuck
So much Balmain on, I feel like I'm a biker boy
I been missin' you but you don't call my line no more
And I swear I get all up in my feelings when you're not around, yeah
I get in my feelings when you're not around, yeah
I get in my feelings when you're not around me
I think I'm addicted to this lifestyle, I swear
I hope you don't just want me for my lifestyle, I swear
Don't you only fuck me for my lifestyle, I swear
I've been tryna show you for a long time, I care
But you came around just at the right time, I get
Jealous when you try come around all my friends
Type of shit that make me wanna fuck with your friends
Make you wanna break the fucking door off my Benz, yeah


Don't get on my bad side, I'm dangerous
Demons and angels hang with us
Treat it like a phone, baby, hang it up, uh
Throw your side up, go 'head, bang it up
Don't fuck with me, no, I'm dangerous, uh
I'm from where they hang 'em, oh
Throw your side up, go 'head, bang it up
Throw your side up, go 'head, bang it up


Ayy, you heard of me? (Heard of me, yeah)
Fuck a Perc-10, need a 30 (I need a 30)
In my FN 'cause they lurking
And a Smith & Wesson's with the broski, no worries
All these other niggas bitch niggas, they get disfigured
Balling, yeah, I swish, nigga, I'ma swish, nigga
Own lane, never switch, nigga, never switch, nigga
Tryna fuck the world, they can suck a dick, nigga (Real shit)
Fuck telling stories, I'ma make one
This is real life shit, niggas make one
I don't care about none of y'all
Need to go and get your money up (Ya dig?)


Don't get on my bad side, I'm dangerous
Demons and angels hang with us
Treat it like a phone, baby, hang it up, uh
Throw your side up, go 'head, bang it up
Don't fuck with me, no, I'm dangerous, uh
I'm from where they hang 'em, oh
Throw your side up, go 'head, bang it up
Throw your side up, go 'head, bang it up
