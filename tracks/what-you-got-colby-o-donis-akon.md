Konvict, Konvict
Ooo ooo, ooo ooo
Ooo ooo, ooo ooo
I peeped you on the phone
Just showin' off ya stones
And notice that that pinky ring
Is bright enough baby
I know you're not alone
But I could just be wrong
The way them fellas houndin'
And sizin' you up baby
And I like the way you take advantage of
Every man you love
I see it, and I know your game girl
But I don't mind if ya come and play with us
Just don't talk too much
I see, you're so cute you don't have to say a word
See all those guys wanna come treat you right
'Cause you're sweeter than apple pie
Everything that you want you got
Girl you know that you need to stop
Most beautiful thing in sight
Always takin' on the spotlight
Always in the club lookin' hot
Girl you know that you need to stop
Always talkin' bout what you got, eh
Always talkin' bout what you got, eh
Always talkin' bout what you got, eh
Girl you know that you need to stop, eh
Always talkin' bout what you got, eh
Always talkin' bout what you got, eh
Always talkin' bout what you got, eh
Girl you know that you need to stop, eh
Girl I can tell you want something to love
That's why you hold on to everything that pass you by
Can't resist girl and I can't lie
Or tell if you are here for me
Or everybody watchin' you shake from left to right
The way you move got me hypnotized
And I like the way you take advantage of
Every man you love
I see it, and I know your game girl
But I don't mind if ya come and play with us
Just don't talk too much
I see, you're so cute you don't have to say a word
See all those guys wanna come treat you right
'Cause you're sweeter than apple pie
Everything that you want you got
Girl you know that you need to stop
Most beautiful thing in sight
Always takin' on the spotlight
Always in the club lookin' hot
Girl you know that you need to stop
Always talkin' bout what you got, eh
Always talkin' bout what you got, eh
Always talkin' bout what you got, eh
Girl you know that you need to stop, eh
Always talkin' bout what you got, ooo, eh
Always talkin' bout what you got, ooo, eh
Always talkin' bout what you got, ooo, eh
Girl you know that you need to stop, eh
I can't keep my eyes away from you girl
When you get on the floor and do what you do
And er'ybody wanna come back to that body
The kind of that remind them of something like you
Be sure that type drive a man crazy
Will snatch him away from his lady
No matter how hard the man hold back
He'll end up callin' you baby
And they never really know what to do
Once you expose that thang you do
Ya had him crawlin' on hands and knees
And ya find a way to get him out that cheese
And while ya thinkin' that you the only dude
She off in the mall livin' off of you
Lettin' er'ybody know she got you
But now you feel like a fool
See all those guys wanna come treat you right
'Cause you're sweeter than apple pie
Everything that you want you got
Girl you know that you need to stop
Most beautiful thing in sight
Always takin' on the spotlight
Always in the club lookin' hot
Girl you know that you need to stop
Always talkin' bout what you got, eh
Always talkin' bout what you got, eh
Always talkin' bout what you got, eh
Girl you know that you need to stop, eh
Always talkin' bout what you got, eh
Always talkin' bout what you got, eh
Always talkin' bout what you got, eh
Girl you know that you need to stop, eh
