Wake up baby, smile at me
The sun is shinin' and the wind's blowin' free
I got to thinkin' oo yesterday
That silver bird can take us away
Get it on now

Single boys, they're out on the town
Lookin' for them pretty girls hangin' around
Man on the radio is tellin' us the news
Summertime's here, kick the mud off your
shoes, yeah


Fly away, fly away
That silver bird can take us away
Fly away, do it today
Come on, woman, now let's get away

I'm tired or workin', feels like for nothin'
Well, I ain't gettin' any younger
Why can't I live for today

Are you tired of workin', feels like nothin'
Well, you ain't gettin' any younger
Why can't we all live for today?

Friends of mine want'a'buy me a drink
So loaded now, hell, I can't even think
Went on home, I put my lady in the car
Jumped on that bird just to see how far we could...
