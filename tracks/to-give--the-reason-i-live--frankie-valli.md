To give is the reason I live
To give all I can give
In return for the life that I earn

I was born as a part of the plan
With the heart of a man
With a will to survive

And I believe
Everything on this earth
Having meaning and worth

Made of concrete and air
Is to share and to feel
Justify, I exist

To describe on the list
Of someone
With a place in the sun

Here I stand
Reaching out for the sky
Till the day that I die

I must give all I can
When I go
I'll go out empty hand

Leaving dust to the land
Just the soul I have found
Leaves the ground
