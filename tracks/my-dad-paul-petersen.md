He isn't much in the eyes of the world; He'll never make history
No, he isn't much in the eyes of the world, But he is the world to me

My dad, now here is a man
To me he is ev'rything strong; no he can't do wrong, my dad
My dad, now he understands when I bring him troubles to share;
Oh, he's always there, my dad
When I was small I felt ten feet tall
When I walked by his side
And ev'ry one would say, "that's his son,"
And my heart would burst with pride
My dad, oh, I love him so
And I only hope that some day my own son will say
"My dad, now here is a man."

My dad, now here is a man
To me he is ev'rything strong; no he can't do wrong, my dad
My dad, now he understands when I bring him troubles to share;
Oh, he's always there, my dad
When I was small I felt ten feet tall
When I walked by his side
And ev'ry one would say, "that's his son,"
And my heart would burst with pride
My dad, oh, I love him so
And I only hope that some day my own son will say
