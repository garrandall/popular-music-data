When I asked you for my freedom
Little did I know
That I'd long for chains to bind me
I left the arms I needed so
Baby, why'd you let me go

Now I'm begging and I'm pleading
Just to be tied down
To the love I thought was shackles
You mean more than all I've found
Come and wrap your arms around me

Darling
Won't you free me from my freedom
Darling
Put love's chains back on me
Darling
Come and free me from my freedom
Without love I can be free
I don't wanna be

Come and take me, love, and put me
Put me under lock and key
Let the walls of love surround me
Put a ball and chain on me
And love me tenderly

Once I left for greener pastures
But the grass was stone
Ooh, if you pave your way to glory
The road leads back to home
Don't make me wait too long

Darling
Won't you free me from my freedom
Darling
Put love's chains back on me
Darling
Free me from my freedom
Without love I can be free
I don't wanna be

Darling
Come and free me from my freedom
Darling
Put love's chains back on me
Darling
Free me from my freedom
Without love I can be free
But I don't wanna be

Now, now, now, darling
Tie me to a tree
Handcuff me

Darling
Tie me to a tree
Handcuff me

Darling
Tie me to a tree
Handcuff me

Tie me to a tree
Handcuff me
Tie me to a tree
Handcuff me

Darling
Tie me to a tree
(Free me from my freedom)
Handcuff me

Darling
Tie me to a tree
(Put a chain on me)
Handcuff me

Darling
Tie me to a tree
(Free me from my freedom)
Handcuff me

Without love I can be free
(Tie me to a tree, handcuff me)
(Tie me to a tree, handcuff me)
But I don't wanna be

Darling
Tie me to a tree
(Free me from my freedom)
Handcuff me

Darling
Tie me to a tree
(Put love's chains back on me)
Handcuff me

Darling
Tie me to a tree
(Free me from my freedom)
Handcuff me

Without love I can be free
(Tie me to a tree, handcuff me)
(Tie me to a tree, handcuff me)

Darling
Tie me to a tree
Handcuff me

Darling
Tie me to a tree
Handcuff me
