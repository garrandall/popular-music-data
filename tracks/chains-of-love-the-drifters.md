The chains of love are the kind
That bind me to you and you to me
The chains of love are not made of steel
But something deep inside that I feel

Oh, I, oh, I don't want to be free
Baby, make a prisoner out of me
With your
(Chains of love)

Keep on drawing me closer
(Chains of love)
Don't turn me loose
(Chains of love)

Now, that's life, baby
Just a little bit tighter
Just a little bit tighter

The chains of love are the kind
That I can't see
You've got the lock, I've got the key
But the key's no good to me

Whoa, and I said that I
Oh, I don't want to be free
Baby, make a prisoner out of me
With your
(Chains of love)

Keep on drawing me closer
(Chains of love)
Don't turn me loose
(Chains of love)

Now, that's life, baby
(Chains of love)
Just a little bit tighter, baby

Whoa, and I said that I
Oh, I don't want to be free
Baby, make a prisoner out of me
With your
(Chains of love)

Keep on drawing me closer
(Chains of love)
Don't turn me loose
(Chains of love)

Now, that's life, baby
(Chains of love)
Just a little bit tighter
Tighter, baby
And I like it, oh, just a wee bit tighter
