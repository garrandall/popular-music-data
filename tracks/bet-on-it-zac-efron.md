Everybody's always talkin' at me
Everybody's tryin' to get in my head
I wanna listen to my own heart talkin'
I need to count on myself instead

(Did you ever)
Lose yourself to get what you want
(Did you ever)
Get on a ride and wanna get off
(Did you ever)
Push away the ones you should've held close
Did you ever let go?
Did you ever not know?

I'm not gonna stop, that's who I am
I'll give it all I got, that is my plan
When I find what I lost
You know you can
Bet on it, bet on it
Bet on it, bet on it (Bet on me)
I wanna make it right, that is the way
To turn my life around, today is the day
Am I the type of guy who means what I say?
Bet on it, bet on it
Bet on it, bet on it

How will I know if there's a path worth taking?
Should I question every move I make?
The thought of lost my heart and it's breakin'
I don't wanna make the same mistake

(Did you ever)
Doubt your dream will ever come true
(Did you ever)
Blame the world, but never blame you
(I will never)
Try to live a lie again
I don't wanna win this game if I can't play it my way

I'm not gonna stop, that's who I am (Who I am)
I'll give it all I got, that is my plan (That's my plan)
When I find what I lost
You know you can (You know you can)
Bet on it, bet on it
Bet on it, bet on it (Bet on me)
I wanna make it right, that is the way
To turn my life around, today is the day
Am I the type of guy who means what I say?
Bet on it, bet on it
Bet on it, bet on it

Oh, hold up
Give me room to think
Bring it on down
Gotta work on my swing
Gotta do my own thing
Oh, hold up

It's no good at all
To see yourself and not recognize your face
Out on my own, it's such a scary place, ooh
The answers are all inside of me
All I gotta do is believe

I'm not gonna stop
Not gonna stop 'til I get my shot
That's who I am, that is my plan
Will I end up on top?
You can bet on it, bet on it
Bet on it, bet on it
You can bet on it, bet on it
Bet on it, bet on it (Bet on me)
I wanna make it right, that is the way
To turn my life around, today is the day
Am I the type of guy who means what I say?
Bet on it, bet on it
Bet on it, bet on it (You can bet on me)
