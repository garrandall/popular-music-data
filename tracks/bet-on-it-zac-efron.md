Everybody's always talking at me
Everybody's trying to get in my head
I want to listen to my own heart talking
I need to count on my self instead

(Did you ever) lose yourself to get what you want?
(Did you ever) get on a ride then wanna get off?
(Did you ever) push away the ones you should've held close?
Did you ever let go? Did you ever not know?

I'm not gonna stop, that's who I am
I'll give it all I got, that is my plan
Will I find what I lost? You know you can
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it (Bet on me)
I want to make it right, that is the way
To turn my life around, today is the day
Am I the type of guy who means what I say?
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it

How will I know if there's a path worth taking?
Should I question every move I make?
With all I've lost, my heart is breaking
I don't wanna make the same mistake

(Did you ever) doubt your dream will ever come true?
(Did you ever) blame the world, but never blame you?
(I will never) try to live a lie again
I don't wanna win this game if I can't play it my way

I'm not gonna stop, that's who I am (Who I am)
I'll give it all I got, that is my plan
Will I find what I lost? You know you can
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it (Bet on me)
I want to make it right, that is the way
To turn my life around, today is the day
Am I the type of guy who means what I say?
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it

Oh, hold up
Give me room to think, bring it on down
Gotta work on my swing, gotta do my own thing
Oh, hold up
It's no good at all to see yourself and not recognize your face
Out on my own, it's such a scary place
The answers are all inside of me
All I gotta do is believe

I'm not gonna stop, not gonna stop till I get my shot
That's who I am, that is my plan, will I end up on top? You can
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on, you can
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it (Bet on me)
I want to make it right, that is the way
To turn my life around, today is the day
Am I the type of guy who means what I say?
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it
You can bet on me
