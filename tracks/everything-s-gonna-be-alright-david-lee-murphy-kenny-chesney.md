She rattled the ice in my plastic cup
I said "yes m'am", fill her up
Tell me something good that I don't know
'Cause this world's been kicking my behind
Life ain't been a friend of mine
Lately I've been feeling kinda low


And she looked back over her shoulder
Pointed at the sign hanging up on the wall
It said


Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
And nobody's gotta worry 'bout nothing
Don't go hittin' that panic button
It ain't worth spilling your drink
Everything's gonna be alright
Alright, alright


So I nodded my head and said, "that's for sure"
Dropped a few bucks in the mason jar
Felt those good old neon vibes on me
And whatever monkey that was on my back
He jumped off just like that
Right into the deep blue sea


And I looked back over her shoulder
Thinking 'bout the sign hanging up on the wall
That said


Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Nobody's gotta worry 'bout nothing
Don't go hitting that panic button
It ain't near as bad as you think
Everything's gonna be alright
Alright, alright


There ain't no doubt it's gonna work out
Come on, sing it with me
There ain't no doubt it's gonna work out
Come on and sing it with me


Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
And nobody's gotta worry 'bout nothing
Don't go hitting that panic button
It ain't near as bad as you think
Everything's gonna be alright
Alright (is gonna be alright), alright (is gonna be alright)
Everything's gonna be alright
Alright (is gonna be alright), alright (is gonna be alright)
(Everything's gonna be alright)
(Is gonna be alright, is gonna be alright)
(Everything's gonna be alright)
(Is gonna be alright, is gonna be alright)
