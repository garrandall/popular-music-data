I like to dream
Right between the sound machine
On a cloud of sound I drift in the night
Any place it goes is right
Goes far, flies near, to the stars away from here
Well, you don't know what we can find
Why don't you come with me little girl on a magic carpet ride?
You don't know what we can see
Why don't you tell your dreams to me?, fantasy will set you free
Last night I held Aladdin's lamp, and so I wished that I could stay

Before the thing could answer me well someone came and took the lamp away
I looked around, a lousy candle was all I found
Well, you don't know what we can find
Why don't you come with me little girl on a magic carpet ride?
Well, you don't know what we can see
Why don't you tell your dreams to me? fantasy will set you free
Close your eyes girl, look inside girl, let the Sound take you away
You don't know what we can find
Why don't you come with me little girl on a magic carpet ride?
Well, you don't know what we can find
Why don't you come with me little girl on a magic carpet ride?
