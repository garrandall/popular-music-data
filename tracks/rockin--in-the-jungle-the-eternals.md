Dancing everywhere
All over the world
Even in in the jungle
Rocking is the word
Ne ne na
Everyone is dancing
Yes and gay
Cheetah, Boy and Tarzan
Even Jane
Swinging through the trees
With a jungle harmony
Rocking till the morning
With this crazy beat.
Ne ne na
Here comes Boy
Singing a song
And Cheetah listening

Says he's kinda slow
Cheetah turns and says
Hey, Boy
Give me rockin' stuff man
The kind that makes me go
Ah, ah, ah...
They're trying to get together
Happy for Jane
Jane's his girl
Jane shakes away
They all get together
Happy in time
They all dance together
Rocking through the night
Ne ne na
