Yo! (Oh)
It's your boy! (Oh)
Daddy Yankee!
All my latinos stand up! (Oh)
Narcando la historia
Caminen conmigo en esta (Ohohoh)
Holla back
You know how we do, man!


'Cause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you)
It's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you)
'Cause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you)
It's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you)


Straight up you're so bad, baby you hot
In the hood you feel the tension when you walk down the block
That's the reason you in my head, believe it or not
Me and you can run the world like Big Pun and Pac
'Cause you my main homie, my main shawty
Cock back hammers and bang homie protecting our gauge slowly
With a girl like you, forget the nonsense
We don't give a fuck about the chicos and gossip (Dile)
Daddy Yankee, you shining right now
Come on, cap me now, I got this game locked down
What you know about big thingsz chrome wheels own deals
Me and you holding it down, it's all real, come on!


'Cause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you)
It's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you)
'Cause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you)
It's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you)


Yo, la negra tiene tumba'o, cuando camina de la'o
Por la calle ocho sin miedo, we be wildin' out
Switching lanes on the freeway, corriendo por miles
A little foreplay, like Bonnie and Clyde en el crimen
Flossing jewels is not a felony
How am I a playa ma'? Do I look like Bill Bellamy?
No te molestes yo soy tuyo na' mas
I'm not a player, I just crush a lot
Come on!


Tú eres la chica ideal para mí (All I want is a girl like you)
Como tú nadie me ha hecho sentir (All I want is a girl like you)
'Cause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you)
It's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you)


Oh, oh, oh (all I want is a girl like you)
Oh, oh, oh (All I want is a boy like you)
Oh, oh, oh (all I want is a girl like you)
Oh, oh, oh (All I want is a boy like you)


'Cause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you)
It's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you)
'Cause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you)
It's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you)


Yeah!
All my latinos stand up!
Caminen conmigo
Bust the floor, bossing
Daddy Tankee!
Barrio fino!
And I'm proud to be latin, man
Letting you know who's the real
King of the Jungle!
Luny Tunes
