Queen B Yeah
I'm the king, y'all know that (Usher Baby!!)
She the queen, came right back (Listen To It!!)
Yeah... Yeah

(OH!! REMIX!!!)

Now baby girl there ain't nothing more than I can say
You know by now I want it more than anything
If I walk away and just let you leave
You'll be stuck in my head like a melody

I know you want it (yeah)
I'm hesitating (why)
You must be crazy
I got a man, you got a lady

I know we here together
So this must be something special
You could be anywhere you wanted

But you decided to be here with me
No coincidence
It was meant to be
Don't be shy
Don't let your boy get in
So you can tell of all your friends
You was on the remix like...

In this club
In this club
Ladies can I put this love up in you
One time if you ain't scared say wassup
In this club
In this club
They can keep watching I ain't stopping
Baby I don't give up
In this club
In this club
Ladies can I put this love up in you
One time if you ain't scared say wassup
In this club
In this club
They can keep watching
Baby I don't give up
In this Club

Baby you know I'd be down
But we can't have all these people starin' standin' around
This right here is only for your eyes to see
But you gettin carried away
Saying we can (Do it where ever)

The way you touching me
Like no other (I'm gonna make you feel insane)
You trying your hardest to make me give in
But I'm gonna be down to give you what you want
And if you keep it up

I strongly doubt this velvet rope hold me up
And I don't won't security rollin' up on us (I got you)
I'm not hesitating I just don't wanna rush
You could be anywhere you wanted

But you decided to be here with me
No coincidence
It was meant to be
Promise if I mess around
I let you get in
You gonna tell of all your friends
You was on this remix like...

In this club
In this club
Ladies can I put this love up in you
One time if you ain't scared say wassup (If you ain't scared baby)
In this club (In this Club)
In this club
They can keep watching I'm not stopping' (They can keep watching I'm not stopping)
Baby I don't give up (Baby I don't give up)
In this club
In this club(I wanna make love)
Ladies can I put this love up in you (I wanna, I wanna make love)
One time if you ain't scared say wassup
In this club (Baby, put it on me, make love to me right)
In this club
They can keep watching
Baby I don't give up
In this Club

Shawty wanna thug
It started with a hug
And her rest went like this
I gave her neck a kissy kiss
She gave my neck a kiss back
I say we cut through it like a stack
I mean we cut through it like a G
On the couch in V.I.P
Shawty we just get it on
I'm like shout out to the DJ
For playing this song
Girl we can act like 2 damn fools
And everybody think we doing a dance move
Call me so I can make it juicy for ya
Meet me in the bathroom
And you can be my secret lover...girl
And it started with a hug
And now were making love in this club
And were not gonna stop
Just because the people in the club are watchin' us
Cause we don't give a damn what they say

Come a little closer
Let daddy put it on ya
Need you to know
What happens here stays here

Well I'm ready and willing
Mama's got to go
Gotcha standing that attention
Keep it on the low

Ain't nobody watchin
Don't worry they can't see us
I know I got you hot
Now let me in

You in the club or the car
Where ever you are
Run and tell the DJ
Run it back on replay

In this club
In this club
Ladies can I put this love up on you (Fellas can I put this love up on you)
One time if you ain't scared to say wassup (One time if you ain't scared to say wassup)
In this club
In this club
They can keep watchin
Baby I don't give up
In this Club
Now run and tell you're friends
You gotta hear this remix like....

King and queen.. you all know
Yeah man

What would music be without 'Sounds'

If we make love in this club, in this club, in this club

Nobody will know, baby.......
