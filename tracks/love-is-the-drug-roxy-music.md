T'ain't no big thing, to wait for the bell to ring
T'ain't no big thing, the toll of the bell


Aggravated spare for days
I troll downtown, the red light place
I jump up, bubble up, what's in store?
Love is the drug and I need to score
Showing out, showing out, hit and run
Boy meets girl where the beat goes on
Stitched up tight can't shake free
Love is the drug got a hook on me


Oh, catch that buzz
Love is the drug I'm thinking of
Oh, can't you see
Love is the drug for me
Oh, oh
Oh, oh


Late that night I parked my car
Staked my place in the singles bar
Face to face, toe to toe
Heart to heart as we hit the floor
Lumbered up limbo down
The locked embrace, stumble round
I say "go," she say "yes"
Dim the lights, you can guess the rest


Oh, catch that buzz
Love is the drug I'm thinking of
Oh, can't you see
Love is the drug, got a hook in me

Oh, get that buzz
Love is the drug I'm thinking of
Oh, can't you see
Love is the drug for me


Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Love is, love is, love is the drug
