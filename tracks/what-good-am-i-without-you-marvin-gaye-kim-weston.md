Wo oh wo oh, wo oh wo oh


What good would a rose be if the raindrops didn't fall?
What good is a telephone if there's no one to call?
What good is a wedding if no one says "I do"?
Tell me, baby what good am I without you?


Wo oh wo oh, wo oh wo oh


What good is a flier if he don't have a plane?
What good is a doctor if he can't cure the pain?
Tell me, what good is a sweetheart who proves to be untrue?
What good, baby, am I without you?

 I'm no good without you, and there's one thing I know
 I just got to have you, darling, 'cause I love you so
 What good is living without the one you love?
 And what good is the heavens without the stars above?
 What good is a true heart that proves to be broken in two?
 What good, baby, am I without you?
