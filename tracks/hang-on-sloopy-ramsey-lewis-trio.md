Hang on sloopy, sloopy hang on
Hang on sloopy, sloopy hang on

Sloopy lives in a very bad part of town
And everybody there tries to put my sloopy down
Sloopy I don't care what your daddy do
'cause you know sloopy girl I'm in love with you
And so I'm singing...

Chorus
Yeah yeah yeah yeah...

Lead break

Sloopy let your hair down girl, let it run down on me
Sloopy let your hair down girl, let it run down on me

Come on sloopy come on, come on - x 2
Well come on sloopy come on, come on - x 2

Well it feels so good come on, come on
You know it feels so good come on, come on

Well shake it, shake it, shake it sloopy come on, come on
Well shake it, shake it, shake it yeah
Yeah...
