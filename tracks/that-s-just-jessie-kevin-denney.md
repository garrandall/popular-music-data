Sometimes in the morning
My coffee gets ice cold
And I'll burn up three cigarettes
Before I have my first smoke
Miss my exit on the way to work
Every now and then
I always blame it on the traffic when they ask me where I've been

And in a crowded elevator
I'll start hummin' that ol' song
There's no way of knowin' when that urge will come along
I've been stuck in some meeting
Looked down at my legal pad
I'd see hearts and flowers and butterflies
And I can't help but laugh

That's just a dirt road
Summer '89
That's just a back seat and some Muscadine wine
That's just auburn hair brushing cross my cheek
And those "kiss me" green eyes smilin' back at me

That's just my mind
Jumpin' fences once again
But, I'll be fine once I get it rowed back in
I know sometimes I may act a little crazy
But that's just Jessie

An sometimes in the evening
I hear barefeet in the hall
And I see a slender silhouette dance across the wall
Then I catch the sent of jasmine perfume in the wind
And I know it's her sweet memory coming back again

That's just a dirt road
Summer '89
That's just a back seat and some Muscadine wine
That's just auburn hair brushing cross my cheek
And thos "kiss me" green eyes smilin' back at me

That's just my mind
Jumpin' fences once again
But, I'll be fine once I get it rowed back in
I know sometimes I may act a little crazy

But that's just Jessie
In a white cotton dress
That's just a wildfire that I ain't put out yet
That's just auburn hair brushing cross my cheek
And those "kiss me" green eyes smilin' back at me

That's just my mind
Jumpin' fences once again
But, Ill be fine once I get it rowed back in
I know sometimes I may act a little crazy
But that's just Jessie
