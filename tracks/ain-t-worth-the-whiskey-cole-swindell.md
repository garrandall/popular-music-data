I don't care that you done me wrong
'Cause I've already moved on
I don't care what his name is
Girl, it is what it is
I won't waste a dime
Or the bartender's time
Trying to catch a buzz
Over the thought of us


But I'll drink to a country song
To another long work week gone
And I'll raise my glass to a long lost buddy I ain't seen
I might stay for one more round
Or I might close this place down
But don't think for a second I'm out to drown your memory
Baby, you ain't worth the whiskey


It don't matter what your friends say
They never liked me anyway
So if they see me drunk in this bar
It ain't over a broken heart


Cause I'm drinking to a country song
To another long work week gone
And I'm raising my glass to a long lost buddy I ain't seen
I might stay for one more round
Or I might close this place down
But don't think for a second I'm out to drown your memory
Baby, you ain't worth the whiskey

Cheers to a good country song
To another long work week gone
And, yeah, I'm raising my glass to those savin' our ass overseas
I might stay for one more round
Hell, I might close this place down
But don't think for a second I'm out to drown your memory
No, don't think for one second I'm out to drown your memory
Girl, you ain't worth the whiskey, no
Baby, you ain't worth the whiskey
