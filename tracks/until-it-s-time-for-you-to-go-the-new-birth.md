Honey? Honey?
Yeah?
It's time
I know. But it's been so nice
Yeah, it has been groovy
But there's something I have to tell you first
And it's a long story

You're not a king
You're not an angel
You're a man

I'm not a queen
I'm a woman
Please take my hand

We'll make a space
In our lives that we planned
And here we'll stay
Yeah, here we'll stay
Until it's time for you to go

Yes, we're different, we're worlds apart
We're not the same
We laughed and play from the start
Just like you were in the game

You could have stayed
Outside my heart
But no, no, no, no, in you came
And here you'll stay
Yes, here you'll stay
Until it's time for you to go
(ooh ooh ooh ooh, oo-oo-oo-ooh)
(time to go)

Don't ask me why (ask me why)
Don't you dare don't ask me how
(don't ask me how)
Don't ask forever
Just love me, baby
Love me
Love me now

Ahhhh, this love of mine (love of mine)
(had no beginning, ooh ooh)
It has no end

I was an oak
Now I'm a willow (willow)
And you know, baby, I can bend

And though you'll never
Never, never, never, ever see me again
(never, never, never, never)
It's too late, baby
Yeah, it's too late
Too late, now
It's time for you to go, oh oh oh oh
And here, here
Here I'm gonna stay
Until it's time for you to go, oh oh
Go-o-o, ooh

It's too late, baby, yes
I hate to see you go, boy
Hey-ey-ey-ey
I know you have to go on
Stay, love
Just stay don't go
Please
Please, please, please
