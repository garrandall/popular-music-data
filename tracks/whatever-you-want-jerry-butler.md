Whatever you want
I want for you
Whatever you need
I need for you

Say, girl, you know I love you
Your love, that's what I live for
Whatever, whatever you want

Whatever you say you want
I want for you

With each breath I take
My soul's a-flame
Each beat of my heart
Well, it repeats your name

Your love, that's what I live for
My love, all I can give forever
You say you want

Whatever you want
I want for you

All I ever want in life, baby
I found in you
And with these hands
I'll build a world around

Whatever you say you want
Oh, my darling
Whatever, whatever you want
I want for you

Don't you know I do baby?
Whatever
