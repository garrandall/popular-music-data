(Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!)
(Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!)

Now there were three children from the land of Israel
(Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!)
Ah, they took a little trip to the land of Babylon
(Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!)
And ol' Nebudchanezzer was the king of Babylon
(Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!)
So they took a lot of gold, and made 'em an idol
(Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!)

And they told everybody 'when you hear the music of the clarinet,'
They told everybody 'when you hear the music of the flute,'
'Now listen, children, when you hear the music of the horn,'
'Ah, you gotta bow down and worship the idol!'
(Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!)

Ah, but the children of Israel would not bow down!
(Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!)
'We ain't goin' to bow to no golden idol!'
(Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!)
No, you couldn't fool the children with the golden idol!
(Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!)

So the king cast the children in the fiery furnace
(Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!)
He heaped on coal and red-hot brimstone, the Good Book say
(Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!)
Even made it seven times hotter than it oughtta be!
(Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!)
Now they burned up the soldiers that the king had put there
(Shadrack! Meshach, Abednego!)
Oh, Shadrack! Meshach, Abednego!

Um hm, then the Good Lord called an angel
Gave him a couple of wings
He said 'go down there through the middle of the furnace
And begin to coolin' the flames.'
And those children got so happy
They went struttin' right through the fire
And this lot they had them talkin' about the power of the gospel
(Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!)

Oh, Shadrack! Meshach, Abednego!
