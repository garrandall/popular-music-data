In a little quiet town
Just south of the Mexican border
There lived a lovely Juanita
A banana grower's daughter
She longed to sing at the opera
But her father laughed and made fun
Still Juanita would sing each day in the fields
As soon as her work was done

Juanita Banana
Juanita Banana
Juanita Banana
Juanita Banana

Juanita moved to the city
In seach of fortune & fame
It didn't take more than a couple of songs
She had won the world's acclaim
Her father back home was astounded
His Juanita Banana a star?
He burned down his trees
He moved to the city
And he bought himself a guitar
