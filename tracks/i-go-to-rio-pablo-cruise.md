Hello?
Hello, Bill. This is Pablo
Where are you?
I won't be able to make it today
Because I'm at the bottom of the pool

When my baby,
When my baby smiles at me
I go to Rio
De Janeiro
My-o me-o
I go wild and then
I have to do the samba
And la bamba

Now I'm not the kind of person
With a passion or persuasion
For dancin' or romancin'
But I give in to the rhythm
And my feet follow the beating
Of my heart

Whoa oh oh
When my baby
When my baby smiles at me
I go to Rio
De Janeiro
I'm a Salsa fella
When my baby smiles at me
The sun lightens up my life
And I am free at last
What a blast

Whoa oh oh
When my baby
When my baby smiles at me
I feel like Tarzan
Of the Jungle
There on the hot sand
In a bungalow
While monkeys play above-a
We'll make love-a

Now I'm not the kind
To let vibrations
Trigger my imagination
Easily
No, that's just not me
But I turn into a tiger
Everytime I get the sight of
What I love, love, love

Oh oh oh oh

Woo!

Oh oh oh
When my baby
When my baby smiles at me
I go to Rio
De Janeiro
I'm a Salsa fella
When my baby smiles at me
The sun lightens up my life
And I am free at last
What a blast

Woo hoo

Whoa oh oh oh...

Whoa oh oh
When my baby
When my baby smiles at me
I go to Rio
De Janeiro
I'm a Salsa fella
When my baby smiles at me
The sun lightens up my life
And I am free at last
What a blast

(Rio)

When my baby smiles at me
I go to Rio
Rio
Rio De Janeiro

Take me back
I put it in
Take me where I know
I'm gon' to Rio
Oh oh
