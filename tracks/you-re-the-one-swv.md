You're-the one-for-me


(You're the one for me)
You're the one
(You can call on me)
Oh, yes
(Is all I want us to be)
Oh, yeah
(You're the one for me)


I know that you're somebody else's guy
But these feelings that I have for you I can't deny
She doesn't treat you the way you want her to
So come on stop running, I wanna get with you


What your girl don't know won't hurt her
Anything to make this love go further


You're the one
(You're the one for me)
When in need
(You can call on me)
When in love
(Is all I want us to be)
Cause you're the one
(You're the one for me)


This can be an undercover romance
Cause I feel that I'm the type of girl
You should give a chance
Taste and see (taste and see)
How good it can be (how good it can be)
Cause you don't have to worry, baby


What your girl don't know won't hurt her
Anything to make this love go further


You're the one
(You're the one for me)
When in need
(You can call on me)
When in love
(Is all I want us to be)
Cause you're the one
(You're the one for me)


So what's my chance
(I'm willing to do anything to get)
In your pants
(You don't have to worry, I won't)
Say a thing
(And if she finds out, I don't)
Know nothing, oh no
(No, no)


You're the one
(You're the one for me)
When in need
(You can call on me)
When in love
(Is all I want us to be)
Cause you're the one
(You're the one for me)


You're the one for me
When in love you need
You're the one for me
When in love you need


You're the one
(You're the one for me)
When in need
(You can call on me)
When in love
(Is all I want us to be)
Cause you're the one
(You're the one for me)
