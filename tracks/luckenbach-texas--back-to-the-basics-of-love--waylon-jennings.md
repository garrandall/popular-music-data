The only two things in life
That make it worth livin'
Is guitars to tune good 
And firm feelin' women

I don't need my name in the marquis lights
I got my song and I got you with me tonight
Maybe it's time we got back to the basics of love

Let's go to Luckenbach, Texas 
With Waylon and Willie and the boys
This successful life we're livin'
Got us feuding like the Hatfields and McCoys

Between Hank Williams pain songs
And Newbury's train songs
And blue eyes cryin' in the rain 
Out in Luckenbach, Texas 
Ain't nobody feelin' no pain

So baby let's sell your diamond ring
Buy some boots and faded jeans and go away
This coat and tie is choking me
In your high society you cry all day

We've been so busy 
Keepin' up with the Jones
Four car garage and we're still building on
Maybe it's time we got 
Back to the basics of love

Let's go to Luckenbach, Texas 
With Waylon and Willie and the boys
This successful life we're livin'
Got us feuding like the Hatfields and McCoys

Between Hank Williams pain songs
And Newbury's train songs
And blue eyes cryin' in the rain
Out in Luckenbach, Texas 
Ain't nobody feelin' no pain

Let's go to Luckenbach, Texas 
With Willie and Waylon and the boys
This successful life we're livin' 
Got us feuding like the Hatfields and McCoys

Between Hank Williams pain songs
And Jerry Jeff's train songs
And blue eyes cryin' in the rain
Out in Luckenbach, Texas 
There ain't nobody feelin' no pain
