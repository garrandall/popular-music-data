You blame the world for everything that's wrong
And you? You think you're cool
Standin' around, just wasting time
And acting like a fool
So take some thought, and face the facts
And find it's only you
Huh!
Only you
Huh!
Only you

Don't blame your neighborhood
You're the one
Your mama can't make you good
You're the one
Don't blame your argument
You're the one
And don't you know how to take a hint?
You're the one
Your teacher can't teach you good
I bet your teacher can't make you love
You're the one
Hey, oh baby

You're the one

You're the one

You're the one

You're the one

You're the one
He's the one
She's the one
You're the one
They're the one
We're the one
You're the one
He's the one
She's the one
You're the one
They're the one
We're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one

You're the one, you're the one, you're the one

Don't blame your neighborhood
You're the one
Your mama can't make you good
You're the one
Don't blame your argument
You're the one
And don't you know how to take a hint?
You're the one
Your mama can't teach you good, yeah
I bet your teacher can't make you love
You're the one (No no no no)
You're the one
