On our block all of the guys call her flamingo
'Cause her hair glows like the sun
And her eyes can light the skies
When she moves, she walks so fine like a flamingo
Crimson dress that clings so tight
She's out of reach and out of sight

When she walks by she brightens up the neighbourhood
Oh every guy would make her his if he just could
If she just would

Some sweet day I'll make her mine pretty flamingo
Then every guy will envy me
'Cause paradise is where I'll be

Pretty flamingo
Pretty flamingo

When she walks by she brightens up the neighbourhood
Oh every guy would make her his if he just could
If she just would

Some sweet day I'll make her mine pretty flamingo
Then every guy will envy me
'Cause paradise is where I'll be

Sha-la-la, la-la-la, pretty flamingo...
