Yeah I was born a misfit, grew up ten miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
Stick to singing, stop rapping like it's Christmas
And if you're talkin' money then my conversation's shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just being on the rich list
Might be insanity but people call it gifted
My face is going numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in this song might get twisted
My wife wears red but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy, and you know nothing about my business
And if I had my fifteen minutes, I must have missed 'em

Twenty years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you Remember The Name
And if you thought I was good well then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent "In Da Club"

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Aye-aye, aye-aye

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Aye-aye, aye-aye


Hey, hey, hey
I can still remember (What?)
Tryna shop a deal (Uh-huh)
From Taco Bell to TRL, I climbed the Billboard charts
To the top until as fate would have it (Yeah)
Became an addict, funny 'cause I had pop appeal
But they said time'll tell (What?) If I'd prevail (Huh?)
And all I did was (What?) Put Nine Inch Nails (Where?)
In my eye-lids now (What?) I'm seeing diamond sales
Like I'm in Zales (Yeah) Without a doubt, by any means
If rap was skinny jeans, I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means, no if ands or butts, are squeezin' in between
You sleep on me, 'cause you're only fuckin' living in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my death bed
Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
So, why would I quit? The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head, I said it, then forgot what I said


It isn't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Aye-aye, aye-aye

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Aye-aye, aye-aye


Ain't nobody cold as me, I dress so fresh, so clean
You could find me in my whip rockin my Fendi drip
Man, you know just what I mean
Shining, wrist with the rocks on it
Buscemi's the locks on it
Everything my voice on, the shit knock, don't it?
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'
It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em
She like the fly shit, and I like to buy shit
Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?
Bitch we be ballin' out, the king bringing 50 bottles
Tonight we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout the shit tomorrow
The turn up is so real, we 'bout to be super lit
Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit
Tomorrow we hangin' over, 'til we start feelin' sober
Then it's time to start it over, here we go again


You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
And it's 'bout time you remember the name
Aye-aye, aye-aye

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Aye-aye, aye-aye

(Hey, hey, hey)
