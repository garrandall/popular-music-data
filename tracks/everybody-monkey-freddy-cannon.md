Monkey, monkey, monkey
Monkey, monkey, monkey
Monkey, monkey

Monkey, monkey, monkey
Monkey, monkey, monkey
Monkey, monkey

I can do the monkey
You can do the monkey
Everybody monkey, yeah

There's a dance going round
That's setting this town
(Monkey, monkey, monkey)
Well, it feels real good
Let me teach it to you
(Monkey, monkey, monkey
Monkey, monkey)

All my friends do it
At the record hop
When you do the monkey
You don't know when to stop
(Monkey, monkey, monkey)

I can do the monkey
You can do the monkey
Everybody monkey, yeah
Come on, take a lesson now

(Monkey, monkey, monkey)
Bend your back now
(Monkey, monkey, monkey
Monkey, monkey)
Oh, spread your knees now

(Monkey, monkey, monkey)
Jump around now
(Monkey, monkey, monkey
Monkey, monkey)

Act just like a monkey
You're looking like a monkey
Everybody monkey, yeah

Well, I went to the seashore
And what did I see
(Monkey, monkey, monkey)
A big boss monkey
Lying right on the beach
(Monkey, monkey, monkey
Monkey, monkey)

Now everybody looked like
They were having a ball
Get in the stance
When you hear that call
(Monkey, monkey, monkey)

You can do the monkey
Swing just like a monkey
Everybody monkey, yeah

Come on, take a lesson now
(Hey, monkey, monkey)
Bend your back now
(Monkey, monkey, monkey
Monkey, monkey)

Spread your knees now
(Monkey, monkey, monkey)
Jump around
(Monkey, monkey, monkey
Monkey, monkey)

Act just like a monkey
You're looking like a monkey
Everybody monkey, yeah

One more time

(Monkey, monkey, monkey)
(Monkey, monkey, monkey
Monkey, monkey)
Oh, spread your knees now
(Monkey, monkey, monkey)
Jump around now
(Monkey, monkey, monkey
Monkey, monkey)

Act just like a monkey
You're looking like a monkey
Everybody monkey, yeah
