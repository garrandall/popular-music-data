I believe in Jesus
His Father's only Son
I do believe He sees us
With the loaded gun

I believe in the magic 
Of the Mujahideen
I still believe in Daniel Ortega
The sun in Omega, The Lord of the Rings
I believe in most everything
I believe, I believe

I have a friend in England
Who says I must escape
The meetings of Mao and Nixon
It's an old debate

But I believe in the magic
Of the King and the Queen
And I still have a young rebel's sympathy
Radical symphonies still have a ring
I believe in most everything
I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe

I fear this muddled thinking
Has to go some time
I fear this sinking feeling's
Not the best of signs
I feel I'm in trouble
As the 80's close
I look to the future
I'm frightened, I'm scared I suppose

You may think it's foolish 
That I still believe in love
You laugh and you sneer
It's cruel
It's what I'm thinking of

I believe in the magic
In the power of the soul
One to one's my equation
That carries the nation on to the goal
We're all brothers and sisters, I'm told

I believe, I believe
I believe in love
Do you believe what you see
Oh, I believe in love

I believe in love
I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe
I believe in love
