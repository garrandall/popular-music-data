Think about the good things
Think about the bad things
Think, Lord, about the right thing
Think about the wrong thing
Lady, before you leave me, you realize that I'm the one who loves you

Think about the sacrifices that I made for you, sing it
Think about the hard times that I've spent with you
But now think about the good things that I've done for you
James, think about the bad things I try not to do


So, come on, sugar, and think about the good things
Think about the bad things
Think, baby, about the right things
And don't you forget about all the wrong things
And lady, before you leave me, you realize that I'm the one who loves you


How much of all your happiness, darling, can I really claim?
How many tears have you shed for which you were to blame?
Hahaha, darling, I can't remember, just what it brought, now you tell me
Well, I tried so hard to please you (You did?), at least that's what I thought


So, come on, sugar, and think about the good things, darling
Think about the bad things
Think about the right things
And don't you forget about the wrong things
And lady, before you leave me, you realize that I'm the one who loves you


How much of all your happiness, now tell me, can I really claim?
I wanna know how many tears have you shed for which you are to blame?
Ha, that's funny, I can't remember, just what it brought
I tried so hard to please you (You did?), at least that's what I thought


Well, come on, sugar, think about the good things, darling
Think about the bad things
I want you to think, Vicki, about the right things
James, don't you forget about the wrong things
And lady, before you leave me, you realize that I'm the one who loves you
And lady, before you leave me, you realize that I'm the one who loves you
Lady, before you leave me, you realize that I'm the one who loves you
