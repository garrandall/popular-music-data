Call me up, and thats all I need, 
Bring your loving, smiling, face over. 
I feel like, getting it right, 
Overnight, start over, 

I thought playing that loving game would never be simple again 
But you're staying overnight, 
So maybe I'm doing something right. 

You can feel it in the trees 
I feel it by degrees 
Feel it fresh and new 
I'm getting myself in love with you 


The sun will rise up, and you'll be in Freedom 
So much freer than you were before 
It's in the seed now 
It's in the season 
I'm so excited its knocking down your door. 

And they say, it's such a funny story, 
After a winter, of getting dull and blue like a tory 
And getting all feared up, 
As their up on their ties, lies, incites the tears to your eyes. 
And the job will know I'm insane 
To go running from love again 
Into a lovers arms 
Like a burgular running out on an alarm 
It's a fucking swarm of bees 
Or some waitress, it's a tease 
Or some song that's full of lies 
Coming round to you late at night. 


The sun will rise up, and you'll be in Freedom 
So much freer than you were before 
It's in the seed now 
It's in the season 
I'm so excited its knocking down your door. 

The sun will rise up, and I will wise up 
So much freer than we were before 

It's in your CD, its fucking teaming 
Saw it around you taking you on a tour 
And now now! Call the fuzz, it's such a buzz, 

From the start 
You press the memory, you press the memory to your heart 
What you waiting for? 
Fall in love is an idea for sure 
What you waiting for? 
Like there was any law 
It's like a sonnet, she's so on it 

From the start 
You press the memory, you press the memory to your heart 
What you waiting for? 
Fall in love is an idea for sure 
What you waiting for? 
Like there was any law 

From the start 
You press the memory, you press the memory to your heart 
What you waiting for? 
Fall in love is an idea for sure 
What you waiting for? 
Like there was any law 
It's like a sonnet, she's so on it 

From the start 
You press the memory, you press the memory to your heart 
What you waiting for? 
Fall in love is an idea for sure 
What you waiting for? 
Like there was any law 


The sun will rise up, and you'll be in Freedom 
So much freer than you were before 
It's in the seed now 
It's in the season 
I'm so excited its knocking down your door. 

You'll bring that blessing 
We'll sing the rest in 
Freedom, to prisoner, to freedom.
