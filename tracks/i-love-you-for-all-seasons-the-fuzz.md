I love you for so many reasons
Which means I love you for all seasons
First of all, I love you with the freshness of a spring day
Then I love you with hot passions like the summer sun
When june's here to stay
I don't know how to explain my love's seasonal change
It seems never the same - all I know is
I love you for so many reasons
Which means I love you for all seasons
I love you with the gentleness of a falling leaf on an autumn day
But most of all, I love you with the briskness of a winter
When the snows come out to stay
I don't know how to explain my love's seasonal change
It seems never the same - all I know is
I love you for so many reasons
Which means I love you for all seasons
(autumn, summer, winter, springtime)
I love you for so many reasons
Which means I love you for all seasons
(repeat to fade)
