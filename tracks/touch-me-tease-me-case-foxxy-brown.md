Papa just keep me laced up
In Ellen Tracy, uh
Cesare Paciotti, uh
Issac Mizrahi
Fuck around with Dolce
Gabanna, sippin' pure 'Zay with the Ill Na Na
Nigga you fuck around
Iâ€™ll have your loyalties and your joints
Nigga your royalties and your points
So what the deal is?
But Foxy Brown met Case
Now we laced
Bonnie met Clyde
Now I'm up in Jamaica breakin' all your paper


You're the only one for me
You're the only one I need
Can't nobody make me feel
The way you're makin' me feel
And girl you know this love is real


Touch me, tease me
Feel me and caress me
Hold on tight and don't let go
Baby I'm about to explode
'Cause all my love you can control


I'll spend the night with you
If you promise you will do
All the things to make me scream
And you know just what I mean
Cuz tonight you taste like ice cream
I wanna make you fall in love
Make you touch the stars above
Please me low and be my friend
I'll come back and hit it again
And again, and again, and again
Don't go away


Touch me, tease me
Feel me and caress me
Hold on tight and don't let go
Baby I'm about to explode
'Cause all my love you can control


What?
Let me get that Lex nigga
Sex wetter than aquariums
Flashin', they get their ass in
Who fucks slow with Lear jets and coups
My ones stackin'
You ain't know that I be mackin', uhh
The extra set of keys
The thirty G's
Them trips to Belize had you livin' on your knees
Not to mention the laced out crib in Dallas
The forty room palace
Sippin' cristal-ise


Touch me, tease me
Feel me and caress me
Hold on tight and don't let go
Baby I'm about to explode
'Cause all my love you can control
Touch me, tease me
Feel me and caress me
Hold on tight and don't let go
Baby I'm about to explode
'Cause all my love you can control
Touch me, tease me
Feel me and caress me
Hold on tight and don't let go
Baby I'm about to explode
'Cause all my love you can control
