So your the girl
I heard the rumor

You got the boys
Wrapped around your finger
Such a sweet heart breaker

Your the game I want
To be the player

Oh you can do whatever you want
It's alright with me
Why don't you break my heart
Make it hurt so bad
Come on give it you best
Nothing less

I insist I want it just like that
Why don't you break my heat
Sounds good to me

Do it over again again again
Your just what I need
Why don't you break my heart

Stare me down intimidate me
Baby please you'll never break me
Bring it on cause I can take

Your so cool the way you play it
You can do whatever you like
It's alright with me
Why don't you break my heart
Make it hurt so bad
Come on give it you best
Nothing Less

I insist I want it just like that
Why don't you break my heart
Sounds good to me

Do it over again again again
Your just what I need

Why don't you break my
Why don't you break my
Why don't you break my
Heart!
