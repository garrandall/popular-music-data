It's strange, I know, but that's the way it goes
Leaving you this way, I'm sorry to say
That my love has faded, faded away
It happened while you were gone
You stayed away too long
You didn't write or even call
I thought you didn't care at all
I was sad as I could be
The same boy who's fella to me
But oh how I tried to resist him, oh how I tried to resist him
But my heart told me to keep him, my heart told me to keep him

It's strange, I know, but that's the way it goes
Leaving you this way, I'm sorry to say
When you get home, I'll be gone
Asked my papa for your letter that I put aside
When you finish the letter, I'll be Eddie's bride

It's strange, I know, but that's the way it goes
Leaving you this way, but that's the way it goes
It's strange, I know
But that's they way, that's they way, that's the way, that's the way it goes

Oh it's strange I know
