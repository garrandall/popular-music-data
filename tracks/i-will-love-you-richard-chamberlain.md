I will love you
Til the day I die
I will love you
And I'll tell you why

Cause your heart is pure
And your dreams are mine
Cause I love you

I will love you
(I will love you)
With a love that's true
(With a love that's true)
And the only thing I ask of you

Is for you to care
Care for me alone
Cause I love you

What would I do
If our love went astray
You're all that I have
So believe me when I say

I will love you
Til the day I die
I will love you
And I'll tell you why

Cause you're life to me
You're just right for me
And I love you
