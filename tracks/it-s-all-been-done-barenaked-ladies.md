I met you before the fall of Rome
And I begged you to let me take you home
You were wrong, I was right
You said goodbye, I said goodnight


It's all been done
It's all been done
It's all been done before


I knew you before the west was won
And I heard you say the past
Was much more fun
You go your way, I go mine
But I'll see you next time

And if I put my fingers here, and if I say
"I love you, dear"
And if I play the same three chords
Will you just yawn and say
'Ah, I hate it.'

Alone and bored on a thirtieth-century night
Will I see you on The Price Is Right?
Will I cry? Will I smile?
As you run down the aisle?
