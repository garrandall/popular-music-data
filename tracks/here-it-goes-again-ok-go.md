It could be ten, but then again I can't remember
Half an hour since a quarter to four
Throw on your clothes, the second side of Surfer Rosa
And you leave me with my jaw on the floor
Hey!


Oh, just when you think you're in control
Just when you think you've got a hold
Just when you get on a roll
Oh here it goes, here it goes, here it goes again
Oh here it goes again
I should've known, should've known, should've known again
But here it goes again
Oh, oh here it goes again


Starts out easy, something simple, something sleazy
Something inching past the edge of reserve
Now through the lines of the cheap Venetian blinds
Your car is pulling off of the curb
Hey!


Oh, just when you think you're in control
Just when you think you've got a hold
Just when you get on a roll
Oh here it goes, here it goes, here it goes again
Oh here it goes again
I should've known, should've known, should've known again
But here it goes again
Oh here it goes
Oh here it goes
Oh here it goes again
Oh, oh here it goes again


Oh, oh
Oh here it goes
Yeah, oh here it goes again
Hey, hey
Oh here it goes
Alright


I guess there's gotta be a break in the monotony
But Jesus when it rains, how it pours
Throw on your clothes, the second side of Surfer Rosa
And you leave me, yeah you leave me


Oh, oh here it goes, here it goes, here it goes again
Oh here it goes again
I should've known, should've known, should've known again
But here it goes again


Oh here it goes
Oh here it goes
Oh here it goes again
I should've known
I should've known
But here it goes again
Oh here it
Oh here it
Oh here it
Oh here it
Oh here it goes again
I should've
I should've
I should've
I should've
I should've known
Oh, oh, yeah, I should've known
Oh here it goes again
Oh, oh here it goes again
