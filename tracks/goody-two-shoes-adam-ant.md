With the heartbreak open
So much you can't hide
Put on a little makeup, makeup
Make sure they get your good side, good side

If the words unspoken
Get stuck in your throat
Send a treasure token, token
Write it on a pound note, pound note

Goody two, goody two, goody goody two shoes
Goody two, goody two, goody goody two shoes

Don't drink, don't smoke, what do you do?
Don't drink, don't smoke, what do you do?
Subtle innuendos follow
There must be something inside

We don't follow fashion
That'd be a joke
You know we're going to set them, set them
So everyone can take note, take note

When they saw you kneeling
Crying words that you mean
Opening their eyeballs, eyeballs
Pretending that you're Al Green, Al Green

Goody two, goody two, goody goody two shoes
Goody two, goody two, goody goody two shoes

Don't drink, don't smoke, what do you do?
Don't drink, don't smoke, what do you do?
Subtle innuendos follow
Must be something inside

No one's gonna tell me
What's wrong and what's right
Or tell me who to eat with, sleep with
Or that I've won the big fight, big fight

Look out or they'll tell you
You're a "Superstar"
Two weeks and you're an all-time legend
I think the games have gone much too far

If the words unspoken
Get stuck in your throat
Send a treasure token, token
Write it on a pound note, pound note

Don't drink, don't smoke, what do you do?
Don't drink, don't smoke, what do you do?
Subtle innuendos follow
Must be something inside

'Cause I don't drink, don't smoke, what do you do?
Don't drink, don't smoke, what do you do?
Subtle innuendos follow
Must be something inside

'Cause I don't drink, don't smoke, what do you do?
Don't drink, don't smoke, what do you do?
Subtle innuendos follow
Must be something inside

'Cause I don't drink, don't smoke, what do you do?
Don't drink, don't smoke, what do you do?
Subtle innuendos follow
Must be something inside

'Cause I don't drink, don't smoke, what do you do?
Don't drink, don't smoke, what do you do?
Subtle innuendos follow
Must be something inside
