The shooting stars are coming out of your eyes
They point the way, the way to paradise
I got a funny feeling, I can't be wrong
It won't be long until the sparks will fly
It won't be long

I hear a buzz, buzz around in my brain
But what it does, is bound to drive me insane
At a time like this I must be strong
It won't be long till the sky falls down
It won't be long

Love has taught me plenty, I'm still learning more
Anything worth having is worth the waiting for
Here I go, I'm on a one way trip
Look out below because I'm about to flip
I tell you when these lips get to that kiss

It won't be long until we're out of this world
It won't be long

Love has taught me plenty, I'm still learning more
Anything worth having is worth the waiting for
Here I go, I'm on a one way trip
Look out below because I'm about to flip
I tell you when these lips get to that kiss
It won't be long, it won't be long until we're out of this world
It won't be long
It won't be long, it won't be long until we're out of this world
It won't be long
