On his way his way home from Candletop
Been two weeks gone and he thought he'd stop
At Webb's and have him a drink fore he went home to her
Andy Wolo said hello he said hi what's a doin' Wo
Says sit down I got some bad news that's gonna hurt
Said I'm your best friend and you know that's right
But your young bride ain't home tonight
Since you been gone she's been seein' that Amos boy Seth
He got mad and he saw red and Andy said boy don't you lose your head
Cause to tell you the truth I've been with her myself
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Don't you trust your soul to no backwoods southern lawyer
Cause the judge and the town's got bloodstains on his hands

Well, Andy got scared and left the bar walkin' on home 'cause he didn't live far
See Andy didn't have many friends and had just lost him one
My brother thought his wife must've left town
So he went home and finally found the only thing papa had left up was a gun
Then he went off to Andy's house slippin' through the backwoods quiet as a mouse
Came upon some tracks too small for Andy to make
He looked through the screen at the backporch door
And he saw Andy lyin' on the floor in a puddle of blood and he started to shake
But Georgia patrol was makin' their rounds and he fired a shot just to flag 'em down
And a big bellied sheriff grabbed his gun and said why'd you do it
The judge said guilty in a make believe trial
Slapped the sheriff on the back with a smile
Said supper's waitin' at home and I gotta get to it
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia...

Well, they hung my brother before I could say the tracks he saw while on his way
To Andy's house out back that night were mine
His cheatin' wife had never left town that's one body that'll never be found
See little sister don't miss when she gets her gun
Oh, that's the night that the lights went out in Georgia...
Oh, that's the night that the lights went out in Georgia...
