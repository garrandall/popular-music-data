If you don't love me
Don't cry in my arms tonight
I'll be cryin' over you

Just say it's over
I won't let you know tonight
I'll be cryin' over you

I gave myself to you
Like a fool with open arms
Never thought you'd ever go
And hurt me, hurt me

I know it's over
But you'll never know tonight
I'll be cryin' over you

I gave myself to you
Like a fool with open arms
Never thought you'd ever go
And hurt me, hurt me

I know it's over
But you'll never know tonight
I'll be cryin' over you
