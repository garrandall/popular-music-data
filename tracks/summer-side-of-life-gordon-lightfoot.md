He came down through fields of green
On the summer side of life
His love was ripe

There were no illusions
On the summer side of life
Only tenderness 

And if you saw him now
You'd wonder why he would cry
The whole day long 

There was young girls everywhere
On the summer side of life
They talked all night

To the young men that they knew
On the summer side of life
Goin' off to fight 

And if you saw them now
You'd wonder why they would cry
The whole day long 

He came down through fields of green
On the summer side of life
He prayed all night

Then he walked into a house
Where love had been misplaced
His chance to waste 

And if you saw him now
You'd wonder why he would cry
The whole day long

And if you saw him now
You'd wonder why

And if you saw him now
You'd wonder why

And if you saw him now
You'd wonder why
