I've laid around and played around
This old town too long
Summer's almost gone
Yes, winter's coming on
I've laid around and played around
This old town too long
And I feel like
I've gotta travel on

Papa writes to Johnny
But Johnny can't come home
Johnny can't come home
No, Johnny can't come home

Papa writes to Johnny
But Johnny can't come home
Cause he's been on
The chain gang too long

High sheriff and police
Riding after me
Riding after me
Yes, coming after me

High sheriff and police
Riding after me
And I feel like
I've gotta travel on



Wanna see my honey
Wanna see her bad
Wanna see her bad
Oh, wanna see her bad

Wanna see my honey
Wanna see her bad
She's the best girl
This poor boy ever had
