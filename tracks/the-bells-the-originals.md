I'll never hear the bells if you leave me
I'll never hear the bells
I'll never hear the bells if you leave me
I'll never hear the bells


Do you hear what I hear
When your lips are kissing mine?
Do you hear the bells honey?
Do you hear them ringing
When I'm kissing you, baby?
What do I have to do
To make you feel the tingling too?


Can't you hear the bells honey?
Say it's just as good to you as it is to me
I hear the bells
I hear the bells
Oh ringing in my ears
Oh singin' "Do you love me? Do you love me?
Do you love me? Do you love me
Like I love you, oh baby?"


True love and joy and faith
And all my strength I'll give to you darling
My love is yours exclusively to enjoy
Any way you want to


One thing I want you to remember
If you ever leave me
I believe I'll go insane
Darling I'll never hear the bells again
No, no, no, no, no, no
Oh baby don't leave me, don't leave me baby
