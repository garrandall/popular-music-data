First kiss, first dance, first hug, first love
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah, I remember
You used to be so sweet and kind
And baby, you were mine
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah, I remember

The sweet things you said to me
Went straight to my head
Now you're loving someone else
And I wish it were me instead

The sweet things you said to me
Went straight to my head
Now you're loving someone else
And I wish it were me instead

You used to be so sweet and kind
And baby, you were mine
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah, I remember

Whoa-oh-oh, I remember
Everything we used to do (I remember, I remember)
And the way we used to play
Can't you see? I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
