Let us be lovers
We'll marry our fortunes together
I've got some real estate
Here in my bag

So we bought a pack of cigarettes
And Mrs. Wagner's pies
And walked off
To look for America
"Kathy", I said
As we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh
Michigan seems like a dream to me now

It took me four days
To hitch-hike from Saginaw
"I've come to look for America"

Laughing on the bus
Playing games with the faces
She said the man in the gabardine suit
Was a spy

I said, "Be careful
His bow tie is really a camera"
"Toss me a cigarette
I think there's one in my raincoat"
We smoked the last one
An hour ago

So I looked at the scenery
She read her magazine
And the moon rose over an open field
"Kathy, I'm lost", I said
Though I knew she was sleeping
"I'm empty and aching and
I don't know why"

Counting the cars
On the New Jersey Turnpike
They've all come
To look for America
All come to look for America
All come to look for America
