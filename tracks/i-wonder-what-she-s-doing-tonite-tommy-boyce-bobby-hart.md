If I had told her that I loved her
She would have stayed till who knows when
But I guess she couldn't understand it
When I said I want to be your friend
Cause a friend would never doubt you
Or ever put you uptight
And now I wonder what she's doing tonight

REFRAIN

Oh yes I wonder
What she's doing tonight
Ohoh I wonder what she's doing
Tonight

We were so close we shouldn't get closer
And it's making me feel so sad
But I tell myself I didn't lose her
Cause you can't lose a friend you never had (come on now)
Cause a friend won't say it's over
And go out just for spite
And now I wonder what she's doing tonight

REFRAIN

(All right Bobby)
Because a friend will always be there
If you're wrong or if you're right
And now I wonder what she's doing tonight

REFRAIN
