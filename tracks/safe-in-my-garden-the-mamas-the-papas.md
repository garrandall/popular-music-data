Safe in my garden,
An ancient flower blooms.
And the scent from its nature
Slowly squares my room;
And its perfume being such
that it's causing me to swoon.
Could it be we were hot-wired
(Safe in my garden, an ancient flower blooms...)
Late one night while very tired?
They stole our minds and thought we'd never know it.
(And the scent from its nature slowly squares my room...)
With a bottle in each hand; too late to try to understand.
We don't care where it lands - we just throw it.

Somebody take us away...
Somebody take us away...

Safe in my garden,
(Could it be we were hot-wired late one night while very tired...)
An ancient flower blooms.
(They stole our minds and thought we'd never know it...)
And the scent from its nature
(With a bottle in each hand; too late to try to understand...)
Slowly squares my room.
(We don't care where it lands - we just throw it...)

(Somebody take us away...)
And it's perfume being such
That it's causing me to swoon.

When you go out in the street, (Safe in our garden...)
So many hassles with the heat;
No one there can fill your desire. (And the scent...)
Cops out with the megaphones,
Telling people stay inside their home.
Man, can't they see the world's on fire?

Somebody take us away...take us away...

Safe in our garden,
An ancient flower blooms.
And the scent from its nature...
(Cops out with the megaphones;
Tellin' people stay inside their homes.)
Man, the world's on fire.)
Slowly squares my room.

Take us away...take us away...
