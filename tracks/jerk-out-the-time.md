Band
Uh, I don't know it's... It's just a thing with me you know
If I see somethin' that I like, it's a... I have to go for it
And I like what I see, baby
Ah, come here


I got real bored on a friday night, I couldn't find a damn thing to do
So I pulled out a suit about the same color as my BMW
I drove to the party and I stepped on in, just to see what I could see
Everybody knew what I was lookin' for
I was lookin' for some company, that's right!


Jerk out
Jerkin' everything in sight
And you know that I'm talkin' about the...
Jerk out
(I got the cash, I got the ride, Oh Lawd)
Got to make some love tonight
And you know I got the look


I saw a real fine thing sittin' by the bar
She looked kinda all alone
So I slid on over and I asked her name
The Stella was bad to the bone
I showed her my stash and I kissed her cheek
The only kind of rap it takes
She knew I was bad when I jerked her to my ride
She said, "How much money you make?"
Let's just say it'll be more money...


Jerk out
(...Than you'll ever see in your lifetime, ha ha!)
Jerkin' everything in sight
I'm talkin' about the...
Jerk out
Got to make some love tonight


Jerk it, jerk it
I'm talkin' about the
Jerk it, jerk it
Jerk out
Jerk it, jerk it
I'm talkin' about the
Jerk it, jerk it
Jerk out


I took her to my crib and I laid her down
Her body felt kinda right
Maybe I was wrong but what the hell, I figured that was what she liked
I said "Baby, don't get too comfortable, 'cause I really like to sleep alone
Leave your number on the table by my data bank. I love you, but you got to go"
(What?)


Jerk out
(You ain't got to go home, but you got to get the hell outta here)
Jerkin' everything in sight
I'm talkin' about the...
Jerk out
Got to make some love tonight
All night
Jerk out
(What's your number girl?)
Jerkin' everything in sight
I'm talkin' about the...
(The master of the)
Jerk out
Got to make some love tonight
All night
Oh, I got to make some love


Jerk it, jerk it
I'm talkin' about the
Jerk it, jerk it
Jerk out
Jerk it, jerk it
I'm talkin' about the
Jerk it, jerk it
Jerk out


Jerk out
Jerkin' everything in sight
( You look so satisfied)
I'm talkin' about the...
Jerk out
( Ha ha ha ha! That's it)
Got to make some love tonight
Jerk Out
(Please, who ever told you, you could sing?)


Jerome, stop at the instant teller so I can get me some cash
Got to make some love to night
Yes
Fellas, y'all play somethin'?
That's it
You know I think I feel the need fo a change
Cross over. There's so many things we can do
You like, ah, Raviolios, Cherrios, Spaghettios
You can just never have enough O's, uh!


Jerk out
(Hey, oh!)
Jerkin' everything in sight
(Everybody)
Jerk out
(No, oh!)
Got to make some love to night
(Whoaoo!)
Jerk out
(Don't you all just hate it when we walk in y'all's joint?)
Jerkin' everything in sight
(And just jerk out everything in sight? Don't it make you mad?)
Jerk out
(Don't it make you mad?)
Got to make some love tonight?
(It'd make me mad)


Fellas? - Yeah?
What's the move? - Jerkin' everything in sight!
Uh, fellas? - Yeah?
What's the groove? - Make a little love tonight!
That's right, fellas? - Yeah?
What's the move? - Jerkin' everything in sight!
Huh, fellas? - Yeah?

Look out, fellas? - Yeah?
What's the move? - Jerkin' everything in sight!
Ha, fellas? - Yeah?

Fellas? - Yeah?

Good God, fellas? - Yeah?

Somebody say Kool-Aid! - Kool-Aid!
Jerk it.... uh!
Make a little love tonight. - What?
Jerkin' everything in sight. - Oh, that's right
Make a little love tonight. - Oh Lawd
Jerkin' everything in sight. That's frightenin'

Jerkin' everything in sight. - Oh Lawd
Make a little love tonight. - Fellas

Make a little love tonight. - Ha ha!


Jerk out
I'm the master of the jerk out
.... Ha, them's your drawers, Morris
Now tell me somethin' that I don't already know J.B
Jerk out. - It's just one of them things you know, huh
Got to make some love tonight. - Money, clothes, cars, credit cards, houses
Jerk out. - You know what I'm talkin about, ha ha!

.... Girl, please!
Oh, well, if you're not doin' anything. We could go there right now

Oh, I'd love that
.... Girl!
Uh, that sure is a lovely blouse you have on
.... Thank you
Can I take it off?

Oh, I just wanna..., oh, I just wanna touch it

So nice, so nice
.... No. Stop
Oh, that was so nice
