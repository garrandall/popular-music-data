You tell me to be strong
You tell me to be strong
Goodbye ain't no reason to cry
It ain't no big deal
You say I'll get along
Sure I'll get along
You're so nonchalant
That it's unreal
Well I thought this love would be all I needed
I thought this love was something to believe in
Now you, you say sorry babe
It didn't work out that way
But don't let that ruin your day
Don't lose any sleep now babe
It's just my heart you're breaking
Just my world your taking away
Don't lose any sleep now babe
Don't you worry about me
No don't worry babe
I'll be alright
Whoa yeah
Don't act so concerned
No don't be concerned
Don't know how much more
Of your kindness that I can bear
Guess I had to learn
I just had to learn
That after all this
You just don't care
But don't let that worry your mind now
I'll be OK
Baby I'll be fine now
It's just I'm watching my world walking away
Don't lose any sleep now babe
It's just my heart you're breaking
Just my world your taking away
Don't lose any sleep now babe
Don't you worry about me
No don't worry babe
I'll be alright
Whoa whoa

Oh

Whoa no no no no no no
Don't lose any sleep now
It's just my heart you're breaking
Just my world you're taking away
Don't lose any sleep now babe
Don't you worry about me
No don't worry babe
Don't lose any sleep now
Just my heart you're breaking
Just my world you're taking away
Don't lose any sleep now babe
Don't you worry about me
No don't worry baby
It's just my heart you're breaking

Don't lose any sleep now baby
