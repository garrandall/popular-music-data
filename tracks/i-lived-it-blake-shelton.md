Daddy drove the wheels off a flatbed Ford
Flies found a hole in the old screen door
Granny said the dress that my sister wore
To church wasn't long enough
Mama poured grease in a Crisco can
Put a hundred thousand miles on a Sears box fan
Uncle Joe put tobacco on my hand
Where them yellow jackets torn me up
And I ain't making this up


Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language
You might not understand
Oh, that's alright, that's just the kind of life
That made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit, back in time 'cause I miss it
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it and man, I lived it


Granddaddy smoked Salems with the windows up
Drove me around in the back of that truck
We drank from the hose and spit in the cup
We all survived somehow
Them ol' Duke boys were flattening the hills
Hollywood was fake, wrestling was real
Wouldn't dream of spending that two dollar bill
From pushing a lawn mower around
I'd go back there right now


Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language
You might not understand
Oh, that's alright, that's just the kind of life
That made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit, back in time 'cause I miss it
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it and man, I lived it
Oh man, I lived it


Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language
You might not understand
Oh, that's alright, that's just the kind of life
That made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit, back in time 'cause I miss it
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it and man, I lived it
Oh man, I lived it
