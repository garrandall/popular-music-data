I walk around town with the pound strapped down to my side
No fronting just in case I gotta smoke something
Round here heads don't act their age
You might be another dead bwoy pon rage
Enter the cipher with your lighter
L's are ready, prepare for another all nighter
But keep a watch for the cops cos they rock Glocks
Coming on the block trying to rock knots
Pigs be acting like they bigger than us niggas from the streets
Cos we stalk mad deep and dem walk beats
I guess dem hold a grudge cos I won't budge
Playing tough, staring down the judge with my hands cuffed
Standing there with my nappy hair and my dirty gear
Au revoir yeah now I'm up outta here
Pigs look me up and down with a frown
Is it cos I'm brown or is it because I'm from Bucktown?


Bucktown!
Home of the original gun clappers
(Repeat x8)


Got five MC that wanna contest we
Got your nooses ready hanging over the trees
Bring on your sounds and get drowned by my massive
Kill you batty boy and hold your lover for hostage
Knock knock niggy-knock that's four shots empty
On a violator that was sent out to get me
I'm tore up from the floor up and everything's black
But still I'm on point ready to buck, ain't nothing sweet, jack
Bucktown, I represent it on the love love
Deeply rooted from my Timbs to my dick above
Don't sweat the bulge coming from my hip
Grip what you get hit when I let my tool click
Nowhere to run, ambush lurks in the dark
Heltah Skeltah smirks while you're getting torn apart
Here come the rude bwoys with the ganja plants
Smif-N-Wessun generals of the Boot Camp




Another murderer, just another prankster
Rude bwoy dead cause him thought him was a gangster
Tried to live the life of a hood from the streets
Test the wrong dread, now he's in eternal sleep
Mr Ripper I lurk in the Stuy
Twist up the ganja when I want to get high
With my bredren, a buddah session, learn your lesson
Or get blasted by Mr Smif or Mr Wessun


Bucktown's everywhere I swear
It's clear to me, you feel the weed, now I really see
Nightfall round the way
Original heads come out to play
Puff herb, break day
It's just a regular, everyday state of being I
Mind holds the weight, rhymes free the mind in time
I find reality follows me where I roam
360 degrees back home in...
