Locked up, they won't let me out,
And I had a long day in court **** stressed me out,
Won't gimme the bail they can't get me out,
Now I'm headed to the county,
Gotta do a bid here, I'm used to living luxurous,
I don't wana live here, the walls is gray the clothes is orange,
The phones is broke, the food is garbage,
A lot a niggas is livin with these circumstances,
Sp's the same I still murk ya manz'z ,
Drug money to rap money work advances,
Niggas ran and told that I shoulda murked to kansas,
Niga got popped for a murda attempt,
Knocked me on d block when I was burning the hemph,
Had a brick in the stash hope they don't take to a further extent,
Locked up and they wont let me out,
When I hit my cell block, niggas know the threat be out.


I'm steady tryna find a motive,
Why do what I do.
Freedom aint gettin no closer,
No matter how far I go,
My car is stolen, no registration,
Cops partolin, and now they done stop me,
And I get locked up,


They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they wont let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out


Headin up town to re up,
Back with a couple peeps,
Corner blocks on fire,
Under covers dressed as feens,
Makin so much money,
Products movin' fast,
Put away the stash,
And as I sold the last bag fucked around and got locked up


They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (my nigga I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they wont let me out, (I got locked up)
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (baby girl I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out


Now that I'm locked up I rep two sets so
Ima ride or die and stay d blocked up
Two tooth brushes up,
Whoever wanted with p
When I walk by nigga get up,
Cuz I'm locked up they cant get me out,
I smoke a stick of haze when they stress me out,
Go and hit the bar when the reds be out,
Cant wait for the day when they let me out,


Cuz visitation no longer comes by,
Seems like they forgot about me,
Commissary is getting empty,
My cell mates getting food without me,
Can't wait to get out and move forward with my life,
Got a family that loves me and wants me to do right
But instead I get locked up


They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they wont let me out, (my nigga I'm locked up)
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out (cuz I'm locked up)
