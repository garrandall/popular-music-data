Got you on my mind
Feeling kinda sad and low
Got you on my mind
Feeling kinda sad and low
Wondering where you are
And wondering why you had to go


Tears began to fall
Every time I hear your name
Tears began to fall
Every time I hear your name
Since you went away
Now nothing seems to be the same


No matter how I try my heart keeps telling me that I can't forget you
If it should ever be that you wanna come back to me, gonna let you


Got you on my mind
Feeling kinda sad and low
Got you on my mind
Feeling kinda sad and low
Wondering where you are
And wondering why you had to go
Wondering where you are
And wondering why you had to go
