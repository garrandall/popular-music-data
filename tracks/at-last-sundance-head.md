At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song

At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you

I found a dream, that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known

At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song

I found a dream, that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known

When you smiled,
Oh and then the spell was cast
Darling here we are in heaven
'Cause you are mine
At last

Darling here we are in heaven
'Cause you are mine
At last
