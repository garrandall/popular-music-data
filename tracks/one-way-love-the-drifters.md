Go and find the kind of girl
Who thinks you're the
Only guy in the world

No more half hearted kisses
That's bad enough
Whoa, oh, no more teardrops

No more (one way love)
No, no more (one way love)

Don't look for someone
Who likes to love fast
You know that kind of love
Will never last

If she's fast and furious
Aww, that can be tough
But oh, if she's kinda serious

You'll never have a (one way love)
Oh, you'll never have a (one way love)
Well, there are girls
Who like to cheat and flirt
Those kind of girls are worst of all
How they lie, whoa, how they hurt
And you (soon will fall)
She's gonna (make you fall)

Take it from me
I know what I say
I'll find me a girl
Who don't like to play

Aww, that game of heartbreak
That's mighty rough
Whoa, oh, no more
Fancy painted up women

No more (one way love)
Oh, no more, no more (one way love)
I don't want a (one way love)
Plain old fashioned (one way love)
