Coming to carry, coming, sweet Mary.
Lay down my body, my sins I will bare thee.
Now I lay me down to sleep,
Lord, I pray my soul to keep,
When the bells a-ring out,
I'm a gonna sing out.
Mama, don't you, Mama, don't you,
Mama, don't you weep no more.
I know where I'm going.
Got no hurry, no worry, nothing to hide.
Now I lay me down to rest,
When I know I've done my best,
When my day is over,
I'll be coming over.
Mama, don't you, Mama, don't you,
Mama, don't you weep no more.
I know where I'm going.
Got no hurry, no worry, nothing to hide.
I've got nothing to hide, I'm satisfied,
Gonna rest my soul on the other side.
Coming to carry, coming, sweet Mary,
Lay down my body, my sins I will bare thee.
