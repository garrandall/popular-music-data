We have just discovered an important note from space
The Martians plan to throw a dance for all the human race

Papa ohh mir mir
Papa ohh mir mir
Papa ohh mm Papa Papa ohh mir mir

Papa ohh mir mir
Papa ohh mir mir
Papa ohh mm Papa Papa ohh mir mir

(eeeee-eeee-eeee-eee)

I got into my rocket ship to see the Martian Hop
I saw the place a shining red, so then I made my stop
But as I opened up the door and climbed the ladder down
I saw the Martians on the floor a-dancing to this sound

Eeee-eeee-eeeeee
The Martian Hop
Eeee-eeee-eeeeee

It seemed I was the first one there, and so I was surprised
To see the Martian twist and stomp before my very eyes
The did the Loco-Motion and the Hully Gully too
I couldn't name a single dance the Martians wouldn't do

Eeee-eeee-eeeeee
The Martian Hop
Eeee-eeee-eeeeee

Now right around the stroke of twelve the dance had just begun
The Earth kids parked their spaceship down on Mars to have some fun
And so I left my friends, the Martians, stomping on the ground
And even though I'm back on earth I still can hear this sound

Eeee-eeee-eeeeee
The Martian Hop
Eeee-eeee-eeeeee

Papa ohh mir mir
Papa ohh mir mir
Papa ohh mm Papa Papa ohh mir mir

Papa ohh mir mir
Papa ohh mir mir
Papa ohh mm Papa Papa ohh mir mir
