Ay, ay, uh
Kanye west:
You love my diamonds dont cha
Let a way a nigga shine why dont you
Baby wats your dis position
Have you ever tryed this position
Your my dream girl from the posters
That i thought i would never get close to
In the back limosines with choffers
Right next to the test-o-arosters
It's funny how all the jourey, just gets your cat so purry
And it look good altogether, they say they all forever
You love my diamonds dont cha
That i bought from all this rythmen
But i know you'll never love me
You'll only love my diamonds

Verse 1:
You mess me up
On the house of my night
I fall in love
Wit you multiple times
Got me wrapped around your finger
Boy i hope you like thingas
I do (i do), i do (do)
Your my one and only rock and a rough
I love to hush you, baby you lite me up
And ther ain't no way
Ill give you away
He's my d-d-diamond daddy
And i just got to have it

Chorus:
Wen i love baby
Im gonna love ya, just like i love my diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds
And wen i wake up every night
(boooooooy)
Will we be shining
Diamonds, diamonds
I treasure you
Cherry chu
Wer you rub my body
(oooooooohhhh)
Cuz people are together
Diamonds are forever
Ice blue baby
(oooooooohhhh)
Wen i love you like my diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds

Verse 2:
Like every girl
Im into fabulous things
Like oyster pearls, and pretty diamond rings
But your my precious pessession
I rock you 24/7
I do (i do), i do (do)
All my acessories, yea i'll give em' up
I'd even trade them in for your love
And the ain't no way
Im giving you away
Your my d-d-diamond daddy
And i just got to have you

Chorus:
Wen i love baby
Im gonna love ya, just like your wer my diamonds
Diamonds (diamonds), diamonds (diamonds)
And wen i wake up every night
(boooooooy)
Will we be shining
Diamonds (diamonds), diamonds (diamonds)
I treasure you
Cherry chu
Wer you rub my body
(oooooooohhhh)
Cuz people are together
Diamonds are forever
Ice blue baby
(oooooooohhhh)
Wen i love you like my diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds

Bridge:
You sexy, you fine
Im so glad your mine
You sexy, you fine
He's my one of a kind
You sexy, you fine
Im so glad your mine
You sexy, you fine
He's my one of a kind

Chorus (repeart x2):
Wen i love baby
Im gonna love ya, just like i love my diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds
And wen i wake up every night
(boooooooy)
Will we be shining
Diamonds, diamonds
I treasure you
Cherry chu
Wer you rub my body
(oooooooohhhh)
Cuz people are together
Diamonds are forever
Ice blue baby
(oooooooohhhh)
Wen i love you like my diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds
