Nola is like a dream come true
She's sweet and unaffected
Everything Nola seems to do
Is really unexpected

Nola has twinkling eyes of blue
And cherry lips perfected
Everything nice
Like sugar and spice is Nola

Walking along the thoroughfare
She always draws attention
All of the fellas stop to stare
She's called the fourth dimension

But if they think
That she could care
It's mere misapprehension
Wait till you see the angel with me
It's Nola

On her hand
She wears a diamond ring
It's a mighty pretty thing
I'm the one who
Saved and bought it

There's a house
With roses all around it
Awfully glad I found it
Lucky I can just afford it

When she's near
The winter turns to spring
Bells begin to ring
There's a magic charm about her

She's divine
And she's mine, all mine
I'm in love
So in love with Nola

Eyes that haunt you
Lips that taunt you
Kiss that taste like wine

If you knew her
You'd pursue her
But she's mine, all mine

Nola is like a dream come true
She's sweet and unaffected
Everything Nola seems to do
Is really unexpected

Nola has twinkling eyes of blue
And cherry lips perfected
Everything nice like sugar and spice
Is Nola

Walking along the thoroughfare
She always draws attention
All of the fellas stop to stare
She's called the fourth dimension

But if they think
That she could care
It's mere misapprehension
Wait till you see the angel with me
It's Nola

Oh, yeah
