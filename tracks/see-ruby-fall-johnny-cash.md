Well I knew someday, Ruby would be leavin'
That she wasn't happy livin' quietly, quietly
'Cause she would get the bedroom look each mornin'
And I felt Ruby pull away from me

Yeah, so go downtown about nine o'clock this evening
Walk under that red light and down the hall, down the hall
Look for the highest flyin' girl, that's Ruby
And if you wait your turn you'll see Ruby fall

Don't let her know that you even know me
She'll be tryin' to forget it all
And don't tell me how is was tonight, tomorrow
'Cause I don't want to see Ruby fall

I didn't hold her back, when she got restless
One man is not enough when she wants it all
Yeah, I let her go when I saw what she wanted
'Cause I don't care to see Ruby fall
