Oh I try and I try but I can't say goodbye

Feel so bad, baby Oh, it hurts me
When I think of how you love and desert me
I'm the broken-hearted toy you play with, baby

You got me going I need you, baby
I can't let go, and I want you, baby
I gotta have you, you know, I can't let go

Though I'm just one of your lovers
And I know there are so many others
You do something strange to me, baby, baby

You got me going I need you, baby
I can't let go, and I want you, baby
I gotta have you, you know, I can't let go

Oh I try and I try but I can't say goodbye
Know that it's wrong and I should be so strong
But the thought of you gone makes me want to hold on

You got me going I need you, baby
I can't let go, and I want you, baby
I gotta have you, you know, I can't let go
You got me going I need you, baby
I can't let go, and I want you, baby
I gotta have you, you know, I can't let go

I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go
