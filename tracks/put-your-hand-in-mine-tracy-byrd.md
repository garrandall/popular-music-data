He sat up on the bed and he watched me packing
He already knew why I was leavin'
I took what I needed but I sure left a lot still hanging
But I figured I'd get it come the weekend
He said Daddy when you get there
Are you gonna have a refridgerator
I kinda laughed and said I guess I will
Then he handed me a tracing of his hand
On the back of a piece of paper
And a magnet and my heart stood still (when he said) 

Put your hand in mine
And I'll be there anytime
When it feels like you could use a friend
I'll be there to lift you up again
You can reach out to me anytime
And put your hand in mine 

I drove past the Hardin Baptist Church
Though it wasn't really on the way to my hotel
Beside me on the seat I was looking at five small fingers
When I heard the chapel bell (and it took me) 
Back another life ago when our hearts were open
Oh, back when we could still agree
Back when the future that we had was full of hope and
You and I we got down on our knees (and said) 

Put your hand in mine
And I'll be there anytime
When it feels like you could use a friend
I'll be there to lift you up again
You can reach out to me anytime
And put your hand in mine 

I couldn't even stay away one night
I noticed you left on the light
And I've only got one thing to say
If you're not too tired and it's not too late 

Put your hand in mine
And I'll be here all the time
When it feels like you could use a friend
I'll be here to lift you up again
Would you reach out to me one more time
And put your hand in mine 

Would you reach out to me just one more time
And put your hand in mine
