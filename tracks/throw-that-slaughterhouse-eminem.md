Right about now
You're about to be possessed
By the sounds of Slaughterhouse


She strips to get tips
Those lips and those childbearing hips
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl
Gonna make you feel me if I gotta shake this building till I make you spill drinks
Girl, this whole building is probably filled with lil' ding-a-lings
But not me, I'll—I'll throw this dick on you, girl (Throw that D)
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl (Throw that D)


They call me, "Nickle Nina," a.k.a. ("Royce!")
A.k.a. ("Throw-That-D"), a player gotta keep a condom on 'cause we play safe, aye
Then I'm taking the condom off 'cause I skeet they face
Then I turn off Jodeci 'cause they say, “Baby, won't you just stay?" but you can’t stay—aye!
It ain't trickin' if you gettin it, if you ain't got that, you ain't ballin’—you mad
They call me, "botox," up in Hermès 'cause I help them get rid of all those bags
(All those bags?) I throw this brick on you, girl
Then I drink up, what's your number? I’mma throw this dick on you, girl


(Aye, girl—clap that!)
She’s got it—oh, she got all the homies (Now, clap that!)
In here, excited, oh, I don't really know (If ya clap now!)
How to describe it
Yeah, yeah, 'cause the strippers love me and I love them too
My bitch be like, "What am I gon' do witchu?" All I know is that I got a thing for her


She strips to get tips (Hey!)
Those lips and those childbearing hips
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl
Gonna make you feel me if I gotta shake this building till I make you spill drinks
Girl, this whole building is probably filled with lil' ding-a-lings
But not me, I'll—I'll throw this dick on you, girl (Throw that D)
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl (Throw that D)


I’m Crooked I, a.k.a., "Fuck-Your-Girl"
(Throw that D) up-up in the sky, when it come down, say—("Fuck the world!")
These strippers are sprung, my middle initial is R, for Richard
And my nickname's right on the tip of her tongue, the side of her mouth is drippin' with—egg
Uh, I’m drunk right now, stumped right now; tryna figure out how
To get four chicks to sit on one chair—oh, yeah—turn the chair upside down
(Upside down?) I throw this grip on you, girl (Girl)
Talking that handcuff you ain't never coming home, man, finna trip on you, girl (Girl)


(Aye, girl—clap that!)
She’s got it—oh, she got all the homies (Now, clap that!)
In here, excited, oh, I don't really know (If ya clap now!)
How to describe it
Baby, you got some incredible skills
I want brain, you want shoes—true love's always head over heels


'Cause she strips to get tips (Hey!)
Those lips and those childbearing hips (I love you!)
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl
Gonna make you feel me if I gotta shake this building till I make you spill drinks
Girl, this whole building is probably filled with lil' ding-a-lings
But not me, I'll—I'll throw this dick on you, girl (Throw that D)
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl (Throw that D)


I said, "Yo, yo—
You got me on a string, I'm dangling like a yo-yo
You string me along and leave me hangin', and that's a no-no
In my world, 'cause I'll—I'll throw this dick on you girl."


Look—(Throw that D)—they call me, "Joe Butt-In," I be around when them hoes strut in (Throw that D)
This relationship is 50/50—if you meet me halfway, I get the whole nut in
'Cause I’m in town—just one day, now, spin round—get your face out the way
And just when she want an encore, I’m gone, Ma, sorry that I couldn’t stay—aye


And they call me, "O-E-double-L Ortiz," a.k.a., "Yaowa"
A.k.a.—nah, nothing, I just got an AK in my jeans, can I spray your flower?
(Spray your flower) I ain't really trying to sit with you, girl
When you finish that spit, let's split, where's your wrist, let me throw this grip on you, girl, girl


(Aye, girl—clap that!)
She’s got it—oh, she got all the homies (Now, clap that!)
In here, excited, oh, I don't really know (If ya clap now!)
How to describe it
Before this night is a blur
Here’s my offer—that shit you did, do that with her
Then both you girls—report right here


'Cause she strips to get tips (Hey!)
Those lips and those childbearing hips (I love you!)
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl
Gonna make you feel me if I gotta shake this building till I make you spill drinks
Girl, this whole building is probably filled with lil' ding-a-lings
But not me, I'll—I'll throw this dick on you, girl (Throw that D)
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl (Throw that D)
