Stars hung suspended
Above a floating yellow moon
Two hearts were blended
While angels sang a lover's tune

And so we kissed
Not knowing if our hearts could pay the price
But heaven welcomed us to paradise
Blessing our love

Then came the sunrise
Fading the moon
And stars from sight
Recalling always
Our wonderland by night

The world became a picture
Framed by a jeweled sky
The night that love decided
To unite you and I

And when our lips completed
That first kiss we kissed
We knew that this would
That both our lives had missed

Then with the dawning
As we beheld that thrilling sight
Without a warning
Our wonderland by night
