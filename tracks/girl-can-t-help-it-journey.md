The other day you know I was rapping with a partner of mine you know real good christian cat
A paster matter of fact and uh you know he told me to whom much is given much is required and with great power comes great responsibility
I told em ya know I could just go off what I been through... you know

I don't know where I'm going
But I do know where I've been
Came so far came so hard
The journey makes you smart
And I've learned so much since then

I tell em I'm doing fine even though I'm doing bad
They got problems of they own I don't wanna add to that
Me okay imagine that its just a magic act
I play hurt and don't cry n they act mad at that
Left on foot came back in a benz
Money don't make me happy you believe it so I pretend
Any man living like me I commend
The situation I'm in is better than the pen
The pen is powerful
The voice is a weapon
The brain is a machine you know if you've been gifted
You've been cursed but it could be worse
Lost contact with those who loved me first
I cant find my place but I diligently search
Don't grunt don't groan but it definitely hurts
Came to find out prayer definitely works
Too worried about the world not concerned with the earth and uh

I don't know where I'm going
But I do know where I've been
Came so far came so hard
The journey makes you smart and
I've learned so much since then

I got pain hydrocodone don't work on
Percoset don't touch it
Oxycontin cant budge it
The pain of dealing with the dirt that I've done
Mamas in trauma crying over their sons
The good girls that I've turned bad
I think about where they at
I was wrong for that
I repent for my sins but I'm so far gone
I cant remember em all can yall
Talking to my oldest
Made her put it on her pinky
Don't let anyone separate you from kiki
Yall sisters
You gone need each other
When I'm gone you still see me in each other
Stick with one another
The world is a bit overwhelming
You need all the help you can get
Someday yall be one another's bridesmaids
Sitting on the porch watching yall kids play

I don't know where I'm going
But I do know where I've been
Came so far came so hard
The journey makes you smart and
I've learned so much since then

My wife so tolerant
Talk about heaven sent
Took her through some places
That she should've never been
Put her thru some things she never should went through
She done did a lot for me that she didn't have to
Argue but a lot of times
I do it out of love
Cause you don't stand a chance
Here if you not tough
She gullible I find that lovable
Cause gullibility for me was over in my teens
She my motivation
They say behind every good man
If you look you'll find
A good woman well there she go right there
With the prom queen face and the Pantene hair
She believes in the dreams that a lot of women laughed
Knows when to keep on knows when to back off
So hard that she gotta be soft
I gotta beautiful lady and she make beautiful babies

I don't know where I'm going
But I do know where I've been
Came so far came so hard
The journey makes you smart and
I've learned so much since then
