If he could hold her, so close in his arms...again
If she could show him
The letter her heart forgot to send...why
They're living dreams on their own
Ohthey'll never stop running


The girl can't help it, she needs more
He hasn't found what he's looking for
They're still standing in the rain
He can't help it, and she's just that way
And when he calls her
She tells him that she still cares
Under the moonlight
He wonders why she can't be there...why
Why do they go on alone
When they're missing each other


The girl can't help it, she needs more
He hasn't found what he's looking for
They're still standing in the rain
He can't help it, and she's just that way
And when he calls her
She tells him that she still cares
Under the moonlight
He wonders why she can't be there...why
Why do they go on alone
When they're missing each other

The girl can't help it, she needs more
He hasn't found what he's looking for
They're still standing in the rain
He can't help it, and she's just that way
And when he calls her
She tells him that she still cares
Under the moonlight
He wonders why she can't be there...why
Why do they go on alone
When they're missing each other


There's a fire
Ohthere's a fire in his eyes for you
Don't you know she still cries
Ohdo you know she still cries for you
Fire
Ohthere's a fire in his eyes for you
For you she cries
Ohdo you know she still cries for you
Fire
Ohthere's a fire in his eyes for you
Ohnothing stands between love and you
