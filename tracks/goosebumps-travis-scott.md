Yeah
7:30 in the night
Oh oh

I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worry about those comments
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, when you're not around
When you throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah

7-1-3 to the 2-8-1, yeah I'm riding
Why they on me? Why they on me? I'm flyin'
Sippin' lowkey I'm sipping lowkey in Onyx
Rider, rider when I'm pullin' up right beside ya
Pop star, lil' Mariah
When I text a cute game, wildness
Throw a stack on the Bible
Never Snapchat or took molly
She fall through plenty, her and all her ginnies
Yeah, we at the top floor, right there off Doheny
Oh no, I can't fuck with y'all
Yea, when I'm with my squad I cannot do no wrong
Yeah, saucing in the city, don't get misinformed, yea
They gon' pull up on you (brr, brr, brr)
Yeah, we gon' do some things, some things you can't relate
Yeah, 'cause we from a place, a place you cannot stay
Oh, you can't go, oh, I don't know
Oh, back the fuck up off me (brr, brr, brr)

I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worry about those comments
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, when you're not around
When you throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time


I wanna press my like, yeah, I wanna press my
I want a green light, I wanna be like
I wanna press my line, yeah
I wanna take that ride, yeah
I'm gonna press my line
I wanna green light, I wanna be like, I wanna press my
Mama, dear, spare your feelings
I'm reliving moments, peeling more residual
(I can) buy the building, burn the building, take your bitch, rebuild the building just to fuck some more
(I can) justify my love for you and touch the sky for God to stop, debating war
Put the pussy on a pedestal
Put the pussy on a high horse
That pussy to die for
That pussy to die for
Peter, piper, picked a pepper
So I could pick your brain and put your heart together
We depart the shady parts and party hard, the diamonds yours
The coupe forever
My best shots might shoot forever like (brr)


I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worry about those comments
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, when you're not around
When you throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time
