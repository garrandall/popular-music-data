Pull the string and I'll wink at you
I'm your puppet
I'll do funny things if you want me to
I'm your puppet

Mm, I'm yours to have and to hold
Darling, you've got full control of your puppet

Pull them little strings and I'll kiss your lips
I'm your puppet
Snap your fingers and I'll turn you some flips
I'm your puppet

Mm, your every wish is my command
All you got to do is wiggle your little hand

I'm your puppet
I'm your puppet

I'm just a toy
Just a funny boy
That makes you laugh when you're blue
I'll be wonderful, do just what I'm told
I'll do anything for you

I'm your puppet
I'm your puppet

Just pull them little strings and I'll sing you a song
I'm your puppet
Make me do right or make me do wrong
I'm your puppet

Mm, treat me good and I'll do anything
I'm just a puppet and you hold my string
I'm your puppet

Your walking, talking, kissing, loving puppet
I'm hanging on a string
I'll do anything, love you 'n' kiss ya
