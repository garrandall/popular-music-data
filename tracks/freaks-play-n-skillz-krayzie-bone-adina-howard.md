(The world has too many freaks)
I can freak you in the morning, freak you in the evening
Freak you at night
(The world has too many freaks)
I can freak you in the morning, fuck you in the evening
Fuck you at night
(The world has too many freaks)
I can freak you in the morning, fuck you in the evening
Fuck you at night
I can freak you on the counter, fuck you on the table
Fuck you right now, 'cause I can't wait to freak you later

(Play)
I wanna, look let you know never that
To the bedroom fuck, straight to the point
My time to clown, let you know from the gate I don't go downtown
To many freaks that'll please me
I'm that playa you better believe
I'm payin' no cheese, but I guarantee
That I still got a freak everyday of the week
I love feeling when you dealing with someone
Poppin' and moving your body all night long
My jewels get bigger when you giving me some
And I get a little crazy when its time to bone
My life made you think that I was one of a kind
And my ice made you think that love was blind
Separate the greats, from the weak freaks
I would never hate, I love all my freaks
But I never bone, never let off to know that
Gotta love the dough, she ain't gotta know
Take it to the room, I don't need your voice
But I may need your mouth to provide the spoon
Didn't think you had the brains 'til I met ya knees
And swallow my skeet and now I see
Why chose one freak when?

The world has too many freaks
I can freak you in the morning, freak you in the evening
Freak you at night
(The world has too many freaks)
I can freak you in the morning, freak you in the evening
Freak you at night
(The world has too many freaks)
I can freak you in the morning, freak you in the evening
Freak you at night
(The world has too many freaks)
Freak you on the counter, fuck you on the table
Fuck you right now, 'cause I can't wait to freak you later

(Krayzie Bone)
I done been around the whole wide world
I been so many different places, seen many different faces
Met girls, girls, nasty girls
Real bad girls, chasin' this platinum world
And around, behind me and my
They sayin' wanna get me high
They wanna spend some time
With a thug and get freaky with it
In a hot tub thuggin' gettin' with it
We can freak a deal
Turn off the lights
Come over here, with me
Take off all your clothes, and freak me baby

The world has too many freaks
I can freak you in the morning, freak you in the evening
Freak you at night
(The world has too many freaks)
I can freak you in the morning, freak you in the evening
Freak you at night
(The world has too many freaks)
I can freak you in the morning, freak you in the evening
Freak you at night
(The world has too many freaks)
Freak you on the counter, fuck you on the table
Fuck you right now, 'cause I can't wait to freak you later

(Skillz)
You gets none from me ma
You gets nada, no Gucchi, no Prada
Hotter than chicks then I mack it down
Pussy, then I pass it layin' me down
Said I been around the world
Ay yah, been head on for the thickest of god
But I don't cuff 'em man, I just rub 'em man
Talk real fine, then I fuck 'em man
Then I love them girls that love to bum, bum, bum
Call me up when she all alone, she'll go bone
She'll ride me day, she'll take my dick
She'll take my name
You don't play
I'm the playa to call
All you get is a little Crystal
Puff the 'dro, you know my style
Coke bottle frame with a kodak smile
Straight with the cheese, I'm straight with the beats
I'm straight to the point, I'm straight to the shit
Why chose one freak, when the?

The world has too many freaks
I can freak you in the morning, freak you in the evening
Freak you at night
(The world has too many freaks)
I can freak you in the morning, freak you in the evening
Freak you at night
(The world has too many freaks)
I can freak you in the morning, fuck you in the evening
Freak you at night
(The world has too many freaks)
Freak you on the counter, fuck you on the table
Fuck you right now, 'cause I can't wait to freak you later

I took my T-shirt and my panties off

I want you to freak me in tha morning

We can do it anyway you like
In the shower, on the counter, every hour
