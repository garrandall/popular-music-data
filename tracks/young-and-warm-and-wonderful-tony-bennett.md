Young and warm and wonderful
You are all I dreamed you'd be
Dreams that seemed improbable
All at once have come true, now I see

Every searching heart finds its happiness
Love is only a matter of time

Young and warm and wonderful at last
You're here, my love, and love is mine

Every searching heart finds its happiness
Love is only a matter of time

Young and warm and wonderful at last
You're here, my love, and love is mine
