She's gone
Out of my life
I was wrong
I'm to blame
I was so untrue
I can't live without her love
In my life
There's just an empty space
All my dreams are lost
I'm wasting away
Forgive me, girl


Lady, won't you save me?
My heart belongs to you
Lady, can you forgive me?
For all I've done to you
Lady, oh, lady


She's gone
Out of my life
Oh, she's gone
I find it so hard to go on
I really miss that girl, my love
Come back into my arms
I'm so alone
I'm begging you
I'm down on my knees
Forgive me, girl


Lady, won't you save me?
My heart belongs to you
Lady, can you forgive me?
For all I've done to you
Lady, oh lady, oh lady

Oh, lady, won't you save me?
My heart belongs to you
Lady, can you forgive me?
For all I've done to you
Lady, oh, lady
My heart belongs to you
Lady, can you forgive me?
For all I've done to you
