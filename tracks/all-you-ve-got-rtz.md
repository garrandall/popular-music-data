Well I heard things took a turn for you
And now you don't know what to do
Sometimes it's a matter of degrees
From being up on your luck
To being down on your knees
And now you'reunder pressure to choose
You're in so deep you've got nothing to lose

So give it all you've got, give it all you've got
Give it all you've got
Just look 'em straight in the eye and tell 'em
Take your best shot
Well they finally put the screws to you
No more waiting for the other shoe
This time the lines are being drawn
And it's time to decide just what side you're on
They'll try to tell you what to do
They'd love to have control of you
'Cause it's your spirit they lack
And once they get it from you
You know you won't get it back
And now you've got your back to the wall
And you're in danger of losing it all
Yea don't let them tell you what to do
Don't let it get the best of you
It's a matter of degrees
From being up on your luck
To being down on your knees
And now you've got your back to the wall
And you're in danger of losing it all
