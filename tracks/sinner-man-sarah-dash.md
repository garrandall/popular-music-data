Don't be touching me
Don't be holding me
Don't you understand

You're too much for me
There's a fire in me
You're a sinner man

With your devil lies
And your evil eyes
Oh, you know you can

Take the best of me
And the rest of me
Damn you, sinner man

You get this started and
There's never any way to stop
I don't know how to cool it down
Yes, you make it hot

I said no, I said no
I said no, no, no
But it never does me any good

When you look at me
You start a fire
Touch me and my flames
Get higher

Don't be touching me
Don't be holding me
Don't you understand

You're too much for me
There's a fire in me
You're a sinner man

With your devil lies
And your evil eyes
Oh, you know you can

Take the best of me
And the rest of me
Damn you, sinner man
Damn you, sinner man

Woo, sinner man

Over and over, you
Promise me your love will last
I have learned, I just
Get burned believing that

I said no, I said no
I said no, no, no
But it never does me any good

There's something
Deep inside me
I feel the devil
Sneaking up behind me

Don't be touching me
Don't be holding me
Don't you understand

You're too much for me
There's a fire in me
Damn you, sinner man

Oh, with your devil lies
And your evil eyes
Oh, you know you can

Take the best of me
And the rest of me
Damn you, sinner man
Damn you, sinner man

Holding me, touching me
Sinner man, ooh, ooh
Holding me, touching me
Sinner man, ooh, ooh

Holding me, touching me
Sinner man, ooh, ooh
Holding me, touching me
Sinner man, ooh, ooh

Holding me, touching me
Sinner man, ooh, ooh
Holding me, touching me
Sinner man, ooh, ooh...

Don't be touching me
Damn you, sinner me

Don't be holding me
Don't be touching me
Damn you, sinner man

Come on, leave me alone
Ohhh...

Leave me alone
Oh, you sinner

Come on, take this fire out of me
But you're still a sinner man
Now leave me alone, leave me alone
Damn you, sinner man
Damn you, sinner man
