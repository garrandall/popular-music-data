If you wanna climb a ladder on a water tower
Then we'll kick it with the stars for a couple hours
If you wanna then we're gonna get way up high
If you wanna dip your toes where the water stops
Then we'll let our feet hang off a fishin' dock
If you wanna then we're gonna have to give it a try, that's right

If you wanna go way out where there ain't nobody around
And let your long hair get to fallin' down
And let your red lips leave their mark all over mine

If you wanna then we're gonna girl
I hope you're gonna wanna tonight
If you wanna then we're gonna girl
I hope you're gonna wanna all night

If you wanna catch a buzz and ride it til the mornin'
Let's get two plastic cups and baby I'll get to pourin'
It don't really matter if it's whiskey or wine, it's fine

If you wanna go way out where there ain't nobody around
And let your long hair get to fallin' down
And let your red lips leave their mark all over mine

Fill up the night air with the radio
And put your hands wherever they wanna go
Yeah, we're right there
Girl just close your eyes

If you wanna then we're gonna girl
I hope you're gonna wanna tonight
If you wanna then we're gonna girl
I hope you're gonna wanna all night

Gonna wanna get a little closer
Gonna wanna slide it on over
Gonna wanna

Gonna wanna go out where there ain't nobody around
And let your long hair get to fallin' down
And let your red lips leave their mark all over mine

Come on
Fill up the night air with the radio
And put your hands wherever they wanna go
Yeah, we're right there
Girl just close your eyes

If you wanna then we're gonna girl
I hope you're gonna wanna tonight
If you wanna then we're gonna girl
I hope you're gonna wanna all night

Gonna wanna get a little closer
Gonna wanna slide it on over
Gonna wanna

Ya gonna wanna tonight
