Hey girl, don't bother me, hey girl, don't bother me
Hey girl, don't bother me, hey girl, don't bother me
Go away, come back another day
Don't bother me

Heard back from my friends
(Hey girl, don't bother me)
Word really gets around
(Hey girl, don't bother me)

They say you're the toy
(Hey girl, don't bother me)
Of every boy in town

They said you like to cheat
(Cheat, cheat)
They said you were just a little flirt
(Cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat)

If I fall for you
(Cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat)
I'm surely gonna get hurt

Hey girl, don't bother me, hey girl, don't bother me
Hey girl, don't bother me, hey girl, don't bother me
Stay out of my home, don't try to use your charm
Don't bother me

But I've really gotta say, you look so fine
You're oh, oh, so hard to resist
But I know I've gotta stay away
'Cause I might fall for you
And I don't wanna be added to your list

So now I say
"Hey girl, don't bother me, hey girl, don't bother me
Hey girl, don't bother me, hey girl, don't bother me
Afraid if I kiss you, I might not resist you
Don't bother me"

(Hey girl, don't bother me)
Don't bother me
(Hey girl, don't bother me)
Now

(Hey girl, don't bother me)
Go your way, girl
(Hey girl, don't bother me)
I'm gonna marry a
