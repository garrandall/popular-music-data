If I could have a mountain made of gold and diamonds like the stars above,
The treasure I would most be longing for would be the treasure of your love.

If I could have a silver ship to sail and all the pearls within the sea,

Oh I would gladly give them all away if you would give your love to me.

The one thing I want no riches can buy,
A love that is true and you by my side.

Don't want a silver ship or gold or pearls or diamonds like the stars above,
What good would all these treasures be to me without the treasure of your love.

The one thing I want no riches can buy,
A love that is true and you by my side

Don't want a silver ship or gold or pearls, or diamonds like the stars above
What good would all these treasures be to me without the treasure of your love.
