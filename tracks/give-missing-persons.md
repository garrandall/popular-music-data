When's the last time you really touched someone
How did it feel
Did it surprise you when you found yourself unselfish
Did it seem unreal
The pressure's everywhere - everywhere around you
Beckon you to turn the other way
But I say the results are superficial
There's only one way to play

Give-when you have anything at all to give
You have everything to live for
(Give all you've got to give)
After you've given all you can
Give again, give again, give again

Give - when you have anything at all to give
You have everything to live for
(Give all you've got to give)
After you've given all you can
Give again, give again, give again

Put your head where your feet are going
'Cause the good outweighs the bad
It's you that should be - you should be knowing
It's for what you give not what you have
When it seems you - you can't give enough
Realize it's the good you do it for
So when the going gets a little bit tough
You've got to give a little bit more

Give-when you have anything at all to give
You have everything to live for
(Give all you've got to give)
After you've given all you can
Give again, give again, give again

Give-when you have anything at all to give
You have everything to live for
(Give all you've got to give)
After you've given all you can
Give again, give again, give again

When you're looking for an answer
Nothing seems to fit
Don't give up
You've got to let your heart become the
Mirror of your mind
Give in

Don't wait for something to cause you reason
Set your goal let your mind follow through
When you feel something to believe in
You'll make all your dreams, all your dreams come true

Give-when you have anything at all to give
You have everything to live for
(Give all you've got to give)
After you've given all you can
Give again, give again, give again

Give-when you have anything at all to give
You have everything to live for
(Give all you've got to give)
After you've given all you can
Give again, give again, give again

Give-when you have anything at all to give
You have everything to live for
(Give all you've got to give)
After you've given all you can
Give again, give again, give again

Give-when you have anything at all to give
You have everything to live for
(Give all you've got to give)
After you've given all you can
Give again, give again, give again

(Give all you've got to give)
You've got to give
You've got to give
You've got to give
(Give all you've got to give)
You've got to give
You've got to give
You've got to give
(Give all you've got to give)
(Give all you've got to give)
You've got to give
You've got to give
You've got to give
(Give all you've got to give)
You've got to give
You've got to give
You've got to give
(fade)
