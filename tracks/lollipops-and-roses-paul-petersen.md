(Lollipops and roses)
(Lollipops and roses)
(Lollipops and roses)
(Lollipops and roses)

Tell her you care
Each time you speak
Make it her birthday
Each day of the week

Bring her nice things
Sugar and spice things
Roses and lollipops
And lollipops and roses

One day she'll smile
Next day she'll cry
Minute to minute
You'll never know why

Coax her, pet her
Better yet, get her
Roses and lollipops
And lollipops and roses

We try acting grown up
But as a rule
We're all little children
Fresh from school

So carry her books
That's how it starts
Fourteen or forty
They're kids in their heart

Keep them handy
Flowers and candy
Roses and lollipops
And lollipops and roses

(And lollipops and roses)
(And lollipops and roses)
(And lollipops and roses)
(And lollipops and roses)
