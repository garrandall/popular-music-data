Tossin', turnin', girl
I just can't sleep at night
Oh, you've been cheating on me
Tell me it's a lie, huh
I called you home
And the phone just keeps on ringing
Oh, baby, what do you think I am?
All I wanna do is be your man
I can't sleep at night
For fear someone holdin' you tight
Make you believe you are mine
And it will be ours 'til the end of time


Something, something, something, something just ain't right
It just ain't right
Something, something, something, something just ain't right


Oh, you make me feel
So good, so good inside
And the thought of another man holdin' you tight
It makes me wanna cry
Don't blame me if I get suspicious, baby
When you're not at home (not at home)
You just had to look so good
Any man would want to make you his own
You, you are mine
And I, I am yours
Tell me, tell me, baby
Is it me that you adore, now tell me


Something, something, something, something just ain't right
It just ain't right
Something, something, something, something just ain't right
Tell me, tell me
Mmm, mmm, oh why, baby
Oh
Something out here just ain't right
Something out here just ain't right (Oh, baby, tell me I'm the only one)
Something out here just ain't right
Something out here just ain't right (Tell me, baby, you know somethin' just ain't right)


Uh-huh
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
See, girl
Thought of another man holdin' you tight
Thinkin' it just


Something (something), something (something) it just ain't right (It just ain't right)
Tell me I'm the only one
Tell me (tell me), tell me (tell me), tell me
You know somethin' just ain't right
Oh, what are you doin' to me, girl
You know I got to be the only one
You know I need to be the only one
Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, girl
Oh, no
Something out here just ain't right
Something out here just ain't right (Oh)
Something just ain't right
I could feel it
Something just ain't right
Uh, I know it
Something just ain't right, no, baby, no, no, no
Oh, make me the only one
I've got to be the only one
Oh, girl, it just ain't right
