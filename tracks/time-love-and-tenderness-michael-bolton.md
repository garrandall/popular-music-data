So you say that you can't go on
Love left you cryin'
And you say all your hope is gone
And what's the use in tryin'
What you need is to have some faith
Shake off those sad blues
Get yourself a new view

Oh, nothing is a sad as it seems, you know
'Cause someday you'll laugh at the heartache
Someday, you'll laugh at the pain
Somehow you'll get through the heartache
Somehow you can get through the rain


When love puts you through the fire
When love puts you through the test
Nothing cures a broken heart
Like time, love and tenderness
When you think your world is over
Baby just remember this
Nothing heals a broken heart
Like time, love and tenderness
Time, love and tenderness

I understand how you're feeling now
And what you've been through
But your world's gonna turn around
So baby don't you be blue
All it takes is a little time
To make it better
The hurt won't last forever

Oh, all the tears are gonna dry you know
'Cause someday you'll laugh at the heartache
Someday you'll laugh at the pain
You may be down on your luck
But baby that old luck's gonna change



Baby, oh baby you just need some
You just need some
Time, love and tenderness

Time, love and tenderness
The hurt ain't gonna last forever
Time, love and tenderness
Time, love and tenderness



Baby, oh baby all you need
All you need is time, love and tenderness
