When I was young my father said
"Son I have something to say"
And what he told me I'll never forget
Until my dyin' day

He said "Son you are a bachelor boy
And that's the way to stay
Son, you be a bachelor boy until your dyin' day"

When I was sixteen I fell in love
With a girl as sweet as could be
But I remember'd just in time
What my daddy said to me

He said "Son you are a bachelor boy
And that's the way to stay
Son, you be a bachelor boy until your dyin' day"

As time goes by I probably will
Meet a girl and fall in love
Then I'll get married have a wife and a child
And they'll be my turtle doves

But until then I'll be a bachelor boy
And that's the way I'll stay
Happy to be a bachelor boy
Until my dyin' day

But until then I'll be a bachelor boy
And that's the way I'll stay
Happy to be a bachelor boy
Until my dyin' day
