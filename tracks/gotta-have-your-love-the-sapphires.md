Ive gotta have your love
Ive gotta have your love
Ive gotta hear you say baby hey youre the one that Im day dreaming of

Ive gotta have your love (Come on baby)
Ive gotta have your love (Come on baby)
I gotta hold you tight I would fight ,punch and kick, scratch and bite push and shove
(Come on baby)

I need you every day
Why die if I couldn’t have my way
So please don’t leave me
Oh please believe me
Id look so o
If you go o
(Come on baby)
(Come on baby)
Oh oh oh oh
(Come on baby)

I need you every day
I’d cry if I couldn’t have my way
So please don’t leave me
Oh please believe me

Ive gotta have your love (Come on baby)
I need to have your love (Come on baby)
I gotta a need for you yes I do like a hand turning blue needs a glove (Come on baby)
I gotta have your love (Come on baby)
I gotta have your love (Come on baby)
I gotta have your love (oh oh oh oh)
I gotta have your love (Come on baby)
