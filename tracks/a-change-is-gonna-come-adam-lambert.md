I was born by the river
In a little tent
And just like the river I've been running
Ever since


It's been a long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come, oh yes it will


It's been too hard living
But I'm afraid to die
Cause I don't know what's up there
Beyond the sky


It's been a long, long, long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come


I go to the movie
And I go downtown
Everybody  keep telling me don't come around


It's been a long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come, oh, ooh, yeah


Back down on my knees
And I know I can carry you


It's been a long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come
It's gonna come
