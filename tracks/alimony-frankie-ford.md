The monkey was arrested for the nonsupport
He sent for his attorney Mister Billy Goat
He said Billy oh Billy go and wash your face
I want you looking good when you plead my case

She want him under alimony
She want him under alimony
Don't set no bail
Give him thirty days in jail
She want him under alimony

The monkey walked in court looking at the judge
He rolled his eyes just like he had a grudge
Man I say it was an awful shame
When Miss Monkey took the stand

She want him under alimony
She want him under alimony
Don't set no bail
Give him sixty days in jail
She want him under alimony

She looked at the jury right dead in the eye
Even the judge began to cry
Around her head she had tied a rag of silk
She said my daughter needs shoes and my baby needs milk

She want him under alimony
She want him under alimony
Don't set no bail
Give him ninety days in jail
She want him under alimony

Billy jumped up and began to shout
Man let me tell you what it's all about
You could fix this man and it's plain to see
You've got to save your time and you can't get free

She want him under alimony
She want him under alimony
Don't set no bail
Give him lifetime in jail
She want him under alimony

She want him under alimony
Yeah yeah
She want him under alimony
Oh oh
She want him under alimony
Hey hey
She want him under alimony
