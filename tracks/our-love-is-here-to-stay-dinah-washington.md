It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone the crazy movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going, we're going a long, long way
In time the rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay but our love is here to stay
