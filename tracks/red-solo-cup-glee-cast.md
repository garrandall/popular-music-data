Now red solo cup is the best receptacle
From barbecues, tailgates, fairs and festivals
And you sir do not have a pair of testicles
If you prefer drinkin' from glass (that's true!)

Hey red solo cup is cheap and disposable
In fourteen years they are decomposable
And unlike my home they are not foreclosable
Freddie Mac can kiss my ass, woo!

Red solo cup (huh), I fill you up
Let's have a party, let's have a party
I love you red solo cup, I lift you up (aha),
Proceed to party, proceed to party

Now I really love how you're easy to stack
But I really hate how you're easy to crack
Cause when beer runs down, in front of my pack
Well, that, my friends, is quite yucky

But I have to admit that the ladies get smitten
Admirin' at how sharply my first name is written (written')
On you with a Sharpie when I get to hittin' (hittin')
On them, to help me get lucky (lucky)

Red solo cup, I fill you up
Let's have a party, let's have a party
I love you red solo cup (what!), I lift you up,
Proceed to party (proceed to party)
Proceed to party (proceed to party)

Now I've seen you in blue and I've seen you in yellow
But only you red will do for this fellow
Cause you are the Abbott into my Costello
And you are the Fruit to my Loom

Red solo cup, you're more than just plastic
More than amazing, you're more than fantastic
And believe me that I'm not the least bit sarcastic
When I look at you and say:
"Red solo cup, you're not just a cup (No, no, God no)
You're my (friend?), you're my friend, yea (lifelong) 
Thank you for being my friend"

Red solo cup, I fill you up
Let's have a party, let's have a party
I love you red solo cup, I lift you up,
Proceed to party, proceed to party

Red solo cup, I fill you up
Let's have a party, let's have a party
Red solo cup, I lift you up
Let's have a party, proceed to party

Solo cup
