Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby you're the best


Nothing more stressful than burying your best bull
Feeling empty make you keep that Smith and Wes full
I realized that it's more snakes and less wolves
So me and my Tre-pound like KD and Westbrook
We just tryna get up out that cesspool
We just tryna eat, not up in no mess hall
My old head that used to rob, dropped the best jewels
He said, "Your failure's gonna teach you to be successful"
I'm rocking carrots but I never ate my vegetables
I'm playing festivals, I used to play the vestibules
Stunting every day, my schedule was flexible
VIP sectionals, grabbing on my testicles
Got an extra full clip for that extra bull shit
Nigga you gotta give us some answers, you're doing questionable shit
Your old lady showed me good times on some Esther Rolle shit
We live in a cold world, I'm on my eskimo shit
It's sad


Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
Baby you're the best
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness


I was born in the summer
Malik died in the summer
It get live in the summer
Head to Brooklyn, I'm knocking this Bobby Shmurda in my G-Stars
Free my GS9 niggas, throw Rowdy on and breeze off
Since a rookie shooting like Ray Allen in that 3-4
When he was a Milwaukee Buck
Not whispering, I'm talking up, look
I can't be worried about ISIS, my life is trifling
Affording dollar slices, just praying they don't indight us
Keeping both my fists raised up, I'm like the fighting Irish
Had molly sales at Notre Dame, when ain't nobody know my name
Remember giving cane out, remember all the misses giving brain out
Remember when Fab was spelling his name out
Before I bought the foreigns, took the train route
When Cam had that pink Range out
It was Reggie, wasn't no paint out
Vegas nights, sky dweller Rollie look like a Vegas light
Was tryna pitch an eighth of white
Just to go eat some steak and rice
I know you hate this life, jeweler acting nervous tryna break the ice
I love red bottoms but really hate the spikes
It's sad


Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
Baby you're the best
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh-oh-oh

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby you're the best
I got my red dress on tonight
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight
Got my hair up real big beauty queen style...
