Bend your back by the light o' the sun
You come to the business--you're the number one
When twilight comes you're a runner in the night
It turns you on like a hot tail-light
Get down--you really get down--you never let down
Come down--you never come down--you never come down

Emotions in motion

Back street boy gonna sell you some sin
He'll wind you up--he gonna suck you in
The blood say yes--the mind say no
The voice in your ear say you go - go - go
Run down--you really run down--you really run down
Cool down--you never cool down--you better cool down

Emotions in motion

Give yourself to a life of extremes
You're into the action--it's a part of your dream
Now there're some things you never can tell
But when the door lies open throw your coins in the well
Get down--you really get down--you really get down
Right now--you want it right now--hold tight now

Emotions in motion
