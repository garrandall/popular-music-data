Flame
Girl you light it up
When I hear you say my name
Yeah, you know just
How to start it

You shine
And I just can't wait
To get you out tonight
Yeah, you know
How bad I want it
Ride this Chevy like a Cadillac
Blow that one stop light
No lookin' back
Wherever we're going
Gotta get there fast

I'm talking red hot, wet kiss
Falling off your lips
I'm talking red hot, red dress
Hanging on your hips
I'm talking backseat heartbeat
Pounding in my chest
I'm seein' red
(I'm seein' red)
I'm seein' red
(I'm seein' red)

Can't get you outta my head, girl
Can't get you outta my head
The way you color up my world
I'm seein' red

Down, we can get down someplace
Just outside of town
Bring a bottle if you wanna
That moon, that moon ain't gonna
Tell on me and you
Just say the word and we're gonna

Ride this Chevy like a Cadillac
Blow that one stop light
No lookin' back
Wherever we're going
Gotta get there fast

I'm talking red hot, wet kiss
Falling off your lips
I'm talking red hot, red dress
Hanging on your hips
I'm talking backseat heartbeat
Pounding in my chest
I'm seein' red
(I'm seein' red)
I'm seein' red
(I'm seein' red)

Can't get you outta my head, girl
Can't get you outta my head
The way you color up my world
I'm seein' red

No, I can't get you
Outta my head, girl
Can't get you outta my head

I'm talking red hot, wet kiss
Falling off your lips
I'm talking red hot, red dress
Hanging on your hips
I'm talking backseat heartbeat
Pounding in my chest
I'm seein' red
(Woah, oh, oh, oh)
I'm seein' red
(I'm seein' red)

Can't get you outta my head, girl
Can't get you outta my head
The way you color up my world
I'm seein' red
I'm seein' red
I'm seein' red red red red red
