Never thought I'd fall in love
'Till you came and took my heart
Never thought it could be love, baby
Should have known it from the start

I used to be, oh, so lonely
Now everything has changed
To be with one woman only
Was always viewed as strange

Never, ever, never thought I'd fall in love
With you tonight
I never, ever, never thought I'd fall in love
With you and it feels so right

Now we're so happy here together
Love has chased my blues away
Like the sun can change the weather
You have brightened up my days

Never, ever, never thought I'd fall in love
With you tonight
I never, ever, never thought I'd fall in love
With you and it feels so right

(Never, ever, never thought I'd fall in love)
I've got a song, right here in my heart, little girl
(Never, ever, never thought I'd fall in love)
I, I should have know it from the very start

(Never, ever, never thought I'd fall in love)
I never dreamed that you would be the way you are, little girl
(Never, ever, never thought I'd fall in love)
Your love light, it shines like the light from the brightest star

(Never, ever, never thought I'd fall in love)
I don't know how you do the things you do to me
(Never, ever, never thought I'd fall in love)
You got the kind of love that makes a grown man talk and a baby walk
(Never, ever, never thought I'd fall in love)
