I got this feeling and I just can't turn it loose
That somebody's been getting next to you
I don't wanna walk around knowing I was your fool
Cause being the man that I am
I just can't lose my cool
My friends keep telling me about the things thats going on
But deep in my heart baby I hope that they wrong
Yes I hope that they wrong but I know it babe

Somebody's sleeping in my bed, baby
Somebody's taking my place
Somebody's sleeping in my bed, baby
And you know just what I need, oh
