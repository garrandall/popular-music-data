Lil Mama and Avril Lavigne Remix

Lil Mama and Avril Lavigne Remix
Lil Mama and Avril Lavigne

Hey, hey, you, you, I don't like your girlfriend
No way, no way. I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend

I could be your girl
Lil Mama be your girlfriend

Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me
No way, no way, no, it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend

I could be your girl
Lil Mama be your girlfriend

Don't get it twisted Lil Mama got her paper on
That mean I'm a paper chaser I chase my paper on
And I gon' be chasing paper that you be chasing on
I just deliver them lyrics that people focus on

Get up in the booth and a chopped-up song
Put it in a store and they go cops on
Everybody know that it's no comp-o
Y'all better lay low like popos

'Case you ain't know better already know
I goes in like project so
So get it biggie mama
B-R-double O-K-lyn drama

Hey, hey, you, you, I don't like your girlfriend (nope)
No way, no way. I think you need a new one (yep)
Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend (yep)

I could be your girl
Lil Mama be your girlfriend

Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me (yep)
No way, no way, no, it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend (yep)

I could be your girl
Lil Mama be your girlfriend

Please eight bars and stop
All I know's sixteen to pop
Told y'all y'all better act on top
Been doing this since Hop on Pop

Aww, got it but I can't stop
Problem is I'm crack on rocks
Problem is they love mama style
So I gotta go harder than I did before
Her style is crossover
Pee wee curling Lil Mama
Ms. Kirkland's going in
So when you see me in the drop top shades
In the summer-time blazing
You wanna be my boyfriend.

Hey, hey, you, you, I don't like your girlfriend (nope)
No way, no way. I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend (yep)

I could be your girl
Lil Mama be your girlfriend

Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me (yep)
No way, no way, no, it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend (yep)

I could be your girl
Lil Mama be your girlfriend

Oh in a second you'll be wrapped around my finger
'Cause I can, 'cause I can do it better
There's no other
So when's it gonna sink in?
She's so stupid what the hell were you thinking?

Oh in a second you'll be wrapped around my finger
'Cause I can, 'cause I can do it better
There's no other
So when's it gonna sink in?
She's so stupid what the hell were you thinking?

I ain't hating
Your girl's a bird
You're by my side
Make it work
You and her that sounds absurd
Me and you more better you heard?

You hear the way them girls laugh in the back
That's 'cause I spit crack on the track
I'm 'a keep it real boy, I'm tryna mack
Let me know if you down with that

Me and your girlfriend we ain't no tie
You better aks T.I.
I'm telling you like Jennifer Hudson

I got plastic elastic in the back of the Jaguar 
We're shopping stacks
I'm popping tags on purses, bags is filled,
I laugh 'cause this is nothing

Hey, hey, you, you, I don't like your girlfriend
No way, no way. I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend

I could be your girl
Lil Mama be your girlfriend

Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me
No way, no way, no, it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend

I could be your girl
Lil Mama be your girlfriend

Lil Mama and Avril Lavigne

No way, no way, hey, hey!
