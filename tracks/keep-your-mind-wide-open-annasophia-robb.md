Have you ever seen the sky
So beautiful, colorful
Wide and wonderful?
Have you ever felt the sun shine
So brilliantly, raining down
Over you and me (or Oh The Unity)

Have you ever wanted more?
Wanted more

You've got to keep your mind wide open
All the possibilities
You've got to live with your eyes open
Believe in what you see

Think of all the days you've wasted
Worrying, wondering, hopelessly hoping
Think of all the time ahead
Don't hesitate, contemplate
No it's not too late

Have you ever wanted more?
Don't you know there's so much more

You've got to keep your mind wide open
All the possibilities
You've got to live with your eyes open
Believe in what you see

Tomorrow's horizons
Full of surprises
Don't let them take your dreams away

You've got to keep your mind wide open
All the possibilities
You've got to live with your eyes open
Believe in what you see

You've got to keep your mind wide open
All the possibilities
You've got to live with your eyes open
Believe in what you see

You've got to keep your mind wide open
Believe in what you see
You've got to live with your eyes open
Believe in what you see...
