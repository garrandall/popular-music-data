So you're walking away, so you wanna call it a day
Think of how I'm trying to keep our love
To keep our love from dying if you should go
Though I hurt you I still love you baby
And I, I, I let you down I, I ran around
Can't you see I'm needing all the love
All the love that I needed so, baby don't go
For I still love you, can't you see it baby

And love is all I have to give
And one life that's all that's all I've got to live
Say say you'll forgive and let me live again
I wanna live again, I wanna live again
I wanna hold you tight, I'm gonna day and night
I want you here in my arms, I want you close to me
Oh baby can't you see, I need you here
I wanna call you dear, I know I want
Baby, baby honey

Thinking of how I'm trying to keep our love
To keep our love from dying baby don't go
Even though I hurt you, I still love you mama
And love is all I have to give
And one life that's that's all I gotta live
Say say you'll forgive and take me back
Take me back and let me live again

Hm -- and that one life that's all I gotta live
I wanna hold you tight the second time around gonna be alright
