Last night I cried tossed and turned, woke up with dry eyes.
My mind was racing, feet were pacing.
Lord help me please tell me what I have gotten into.
Ran my 3 miles to clear my mind, it always helps me out,
It's my therapy when I'm losing it which is usually.


I'm on a emotional roller coaster.
Loving you ain't nothing healthy.
Loving you was never good for me.
But I can't get off.
It's emotional roller coaster,
Loving you ain't nothing healthy,
Loving you was never good for me, for me,
But I can't get off.


Yesterday I told myself I was gonna be okay.
Gonna start a new day, be truly happy.
I was gonna take control of me.
But eventually reality hit me
Mentally, physically, emotionally.
And I opened my eyes and realized
That I was still being taken for a constant ride on your...


Emotional roller coaster.
Loving you ain't nothing healthy.
Loving you was never good for me.
But I can't get off.
Emotional roller coaster,
Loving you ain't nothing healthy,
Loving you was never good for me,
But I can't get off.


So tired of you making love to me, then disappearing so suddenly.
Up and down it goes.
And I'm so tired of you pacifying me
With promises you know that you'll never keep.
Round and round it goes.


I am on a emotional roller coaster.
Loving you ain't nothing healthy.
Loving you was never good for me.
But I can't get off.
It's emotional roller coaster,
Loving you ain't nothing healthy,
Loving you was never good for me,
But I can't get off.
