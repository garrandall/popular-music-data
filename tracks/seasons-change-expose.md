Some dreams are in the night time
And some seem like yesterday
But leaves turn brown and fade
Ships sail away
You long to say a thousand words but
Seasons change

It feels like it's forever
No reason for emptiness
But time just runs away (time runs away)
No more day by day
You dream again, it seems in vain when
Seasons change

(I want you) I want to feel you by my side
(I need you) Don't you know I need you, baby?

(Seasons change, feelings change)
It's been so long since I found you
Yet it seems like yesterday
(Seasons change, people change)
I'll sacrifice tomorrow
Just to have you here today

Forever seems so far away
There's time for love and for play
You dream about today (about today)
Feeling slips away
The winds that blow, they go away and
Seasons change

(I want you) Don't hide your feelings from inside
(I need you) I've got to have your love now, baby

(Seasons change, feelings change)
It's been so long since I found you
Yet it seems like yesterday
(Seasons change, people change)

(I want you) I want to feel you by my side
(I need you) I've got to have your love now, baby

(Seasons change, feelings change)
It's been so long since I found you
Yet it seems like yesterday
(Seasons change, people change)
I'll sacrifice tomorrow
Just to have you here today
Just to have you here today

(Seasons change, feelings change)
It's been so long since I found you
Yet it seems like yesterday
(Seasons change) Seasons change
(People change) People change

(Seasons change) Seasons change
(Feelings change) Feelings change
Change the season
(Seasons change, people change)
(Seasons change, feelings change)
