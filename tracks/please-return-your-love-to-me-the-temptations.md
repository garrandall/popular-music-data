(Please return your love to me, girl)
(Forgive me for the wrong I've done)

And, oh, baby
I cry myself to sleep at night
For fear of a-never holdin' you tight at all, baby (whoa, baby)
I miss ya more with each passin' day
Every night on my knees I pray
Oh, oh, baby (please)


(Return your love to me, girl)
(Forgive me for the wrong I've done
(Without your love, I'm just no good)
(For I am just a lonely boy)

I'm sorry for the wrong I've done
Now I know how it feels to lose that special someone (whoa, baby)
I need you more than words can say
Without your love I can't face another day
Oh, (please)

(Return your love to me, girl)
(Forgive me for the wrong I've done
(Without your love, I'm just no good)
(I am just a lonely one)

Oh, no, no-o-o-o, babe

If there's a heav'n above you'll be my one and only love (and, oh, baby)
I can't control the glow in me
Girl, come on and and see about me

(Oh, ple-ea-ease)

(Return your love to me, girl)
(Forgive me for the wrong I've done
(Without your love, I'm just no good)
(I am just a lonely one)

I'm a lonely one
I'm a lonely one
I'm a lonely one
I'm just a lonelyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy onnnnnnnnnnnnne (I am just a)


(Please, return your love to me, girl)
(Forgive me for the wrong I've done
(Without your love, I'm just no good)
(I am just a lonely one)
