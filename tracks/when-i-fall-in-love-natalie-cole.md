And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too 
Is when I fall in love with you.

When I fall in love it will be forever 
Or I'll never fall in love 
In a restless world like this is 
Love is ended before it's begun 
And too many moonlight kisses 
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun
When I give my heart it will be completely (Completely)
Or I'll never give my heart (Give my heart)

And the moment 
I can feel that you feel that way too 
Is when I fall in love (When I fall in love) with you

Oh, this love feels so right.

(When... I give my heart)
When I give my heart, it will be completely
(Completely)
Or I'll never (never, never) give my heart 
(Never give my heart)
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too 
Is when I fall in love  
(When I fall in love) 
Is when I fall in love with you
Ohhhh  
I love you
