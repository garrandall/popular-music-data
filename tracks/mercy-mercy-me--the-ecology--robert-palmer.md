Whoa, oh mercy mercy me
Oh, things ain't what they used to be, no, no
Where did all the blue skies go?
Poison is the wind that blows
From the north and south and east
Oh, mercy mercy me
Oh, things ain't what they used to be, no no
Oil wasted on the oceans and our seas
Ah, fish full of mercury
Ah ha, ah mercy mercy me
Oh, things ain't what they used to be, no no
Radiation underground and in the sky
Animals and birds who live nearby all die
Whoa, mercy mercy me
Oh, things ain't what they used to be
What about this overcrowded land
How much more abuse from man can she stand?
I want you the right way
I want you, but I want you to want me too
Want you to want me baby
Just like I want you
Oh, I'll give you all the love that you want in return, sweet darling
Your happiness is all I crave
It's too bad, it's just too sad, you don't want me no more
But I'm gonna change your mind, some way, somehow baby
I want you the right way
I want you, but I want you to want me too
I want you to want me baby
Just like I want you, oh
Well one way love is just a fantasy, ah sugar
To share is precious, pure and fair, oh
Don't play with something you should cherish for life, baby
Don't you wanna care? Lonely out there
I want you the right way
I want you, but I want you to want me too
Want you to want me baby
Just like I want you, oh
