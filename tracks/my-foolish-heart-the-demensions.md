The scene is set for dreaming
Love's knocking at my door
But oh, my heart
I'm reluctant to start
For we've been fooled before

The night is like a lovely tune
Beware, my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care, my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see in an evening such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're lost in the magic of a kiss (magic of kiss)
Your lips are much too close to mine
Beware, my foolish heart

But should, should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start
For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart

This time it's love
My foolish heart
