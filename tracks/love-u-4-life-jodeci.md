Promises you made me
All the things you told me
You said you'd never leave me
We'll be together for eternity
Now it's all in the past
Now I know our love will last
Lady I will do all I can
Lady I will be all I am
I'll give you all you had before
So come on in and close the door
Let me show you what I could be
Could you just please tell me



Do you believe in love
And the promise that it gives
I wanna love you for life
Cause your love is why I live
Do you believe in love
And the promise that it gives
I wanna love you for life
Cause your love is why I live

I know that things are rough
But my faith wasn't strong enough
Now my heart is built to last
My heart is beating for you fast
But now I know that you understand
I wanna take you by the hand
And walk with you down that aisle
And with you I will live my life
I'll give you all you had before
So come on in and close the door
Let me show you what I could be
If you just please tell me

Do you believe in love
And the promise that it gives
I wanna love you for life
Cause your love is why I live
Do you believe in love
And the promise that it gives
I wanna love you for life
Cause your love is why I live

I want you to know that it's for real
This feeling that I feel
I want you to know that it's so real
Tell me will you

Do you believe in love
And the promise that it gives
I wanna love you for life
Cause your love is why I live
Do you believe in love
And the promise that it gives
I wanna love you for life
Cause your love is why I live
Do you believe in love
And the promise that it gives
I wanna love you for life
Cause your love is why I live
Do you believe in love
And the promise that it gives
I wanna love you for life
Cause your love is why I live
