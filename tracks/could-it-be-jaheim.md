Huh, uh yeah
Bout to put it to 'em
With some ghetto slick shit, heh
Check it out, one time
For your motherfucking mind (motherfucking mind)
Yo I'm saying they gon' smell me on this one, nigga
No doubt, he-heh
Check it out, oh yeah
Listen


On the cross town with the top down
Sounds banging out the backseats (alright)
Me and shorty two deep
She's flashing me thighs
Wind blowing through her hair
Baby we can take it there (take it there)
But first I gotta make my rounds
Baby slow down
My crib's on the other side of town
But from the look in her eyes
She was hypnotized
Rubbed her hands on my chest
And started getting undressed
Tell me why


Could it be my chromed out rims? (baby)
Break you neck when you see a nigga dip (mmm)
Or could it be the ice you see? (ice you see me)
But you tell me that you're really feeling me
(That you're feeling me, feeling me, feeling me, baby)
Could it be the word on the block?
I know they told you that a nigga got it locked (so tight, so tight)
Tell me why you just can't stop (just can't stop)
I'm thinking that it's all about me (all about me)
What could it be?


I got the sixty inch flat TV, what?
Satellite, DVD, whatever you need
I got the bubbles in the tub with the back rub (bathtub)
Silk sheets baby to make love
Oh girl I wanna hit it in the worst way
After that you'll be coming back like every day (oh yeah)
Send you back to your girls with something else to say
How I hit it, split it, had you with it 'til the break of day


Could it be my chromed out rims?
Break you neck when you see a nigga dip (oh)
Or could it be the ice you see?
But you tell me that you're really feeling me
(I've gotta know right now)
Could it be the word on the block? (oohh)
I know they told you that a nigga got it locked (so tight, so tight)
Tell me why you just can't stop (just can't stop)
I'm thinking that it's all about me
What could it be? (What it could be?)


Could it be the drop top Benz
That got your friends going out on a limb (huh?)
Sliding me numbers when you ain't watching them (watching them)
Playing me close but I'm not feeling them (oh no, oh no)
Could it be the time piece flooded with chips?
Is it because I flex baguettes around my wrist? (huh)
Or large amounts up in my bank account (my bank account)
You tell me you love me baby but what's that all about (ooohhh)


Could it be my chromed out rims?
Break you neck when you see a nigga dip (baby)
Or could it be the ice you see? (shining so bright)
But you tell me that you're really feeling me
(That you're feeling me, feeling me)
Could it be the word on the block? (I know)
I know they told you that a nigga got it locked  (so tight)
Tell me why you just can't stop (ah yeah)
I'm thinking that it's all about me (alright, alright)
What could it be?
Could it be my chromed out rims?
(Could it be my chromed out rims?)
Break you neck when you see a nigga dip (ooohhh yeah)
Or could it be the ice you see?
But you tell me that you're really feeling me (ooohhh, baby)
Could it be the word on the block? (tell me)
I know they told you that a nigga got it locked (so tight, so tight)
Tell me why you just can't stop (no, no)
I'm thinking that it's all about me (all about me)
What could it be? (What it could be?)
