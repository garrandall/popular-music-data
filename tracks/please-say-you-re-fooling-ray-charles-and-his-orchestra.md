You say you're leaving me
For someone new
Please say you're teasing me
Say it's not true


Say it, come on
And say you're fooling
Whoa, say it's a lie
Whoa, say you're fooling me, baby
Don't say goodbye


Whoa, if our romance is really done
Don't you know my heart
Will never see the sun
To me, you're everything
That is sweet and divine
Don't keep me wandering, baby
If you're still me
