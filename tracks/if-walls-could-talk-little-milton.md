Hey y'all!
If walls could talk then I'm sure you'd hear
A lot of things that would make you cry my dear


Now ain't you glad, ha!
Oh, ain't you glad
That walls don't talk
I tell you they never talk


Listen!
If doors could tell, who turned the knob
When he's away, away on his job


Now ain't you glad
I know you oughta be glad
That doors don't talk
They never talk


Oh!
If cars could say, who's been inside
And who's been taken, been taken for a ride!


Now ain't you glad
I know you oughta be glad
That cars don't talk
Oh no they don't talk
Come on now!


Yeah!
Prove it!
Here's the part I like
Hah! Come on!
That's alright


Listen!
If shoes could tell, where they've been
When you claim that you were visiting a friend


Now ain't you glad
I know you oughta be glad
That shoes don't talk
Oh they never talk
Sing this!


In a world of trouble we'd be
If things ever told on me
My love life would be through
'Cause I'm guilty, how 'bout you!
Listen!
If things ever talked that way
Ain't no telling what they might say


So ain't you glad
Everybody oughta be glad
That things don't talk
I tell you that they don't talk


'Cause I'm so glad
Things don't talk
Because if they did
I believe we'd all be in a big world of trouble baby, ow!
Things don't talk!
And they never talk
Can do whatcha wanna
As long as...
