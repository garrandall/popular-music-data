Dolly

Well, Horace, it looks as if there's nothing more for me to say, but--

Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye.
Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye.
Don't try to stop me Horace please...
Wave your little hand and whisper
So long dearie
You ain't gonna see me anymore
But when you discover that your life is dreary
Don't you come a knockin' at my door
For I'll be all dolled up
And singin' that song
That says you dog, I told you so
So wave your little hand and whisper
So long dearie
Dearie, should have said so long
So long ago

Because you've treated me so rotten and rough
I've had enough of feelin' low
So wave your little hand and whisper
So long dearie
Dearie would have said so long
So long ago

For I can hear that choo choo callin' me on
To a fancy new address
Yes, I can hear that choo choo callin' me on
On board that happiness express
I'm gonna learn to dance and drink and smoke a cigarette
I'm go'n as far away from Yonkers as a girl can get


And on those cold winter nights, Horace...
You can snuggle up to your cash register.
It's a bit lumpy but it rings!


Don't come a knockin'
I'll be all dolled up
And singin' that song
That says you dog, I told you so
So Horace, you will find your life a sad old story
When you see your Dolly shuffle off to glory
Oh I should have said so long...
So Long ago!
