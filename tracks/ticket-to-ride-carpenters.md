I think I'm gonna be sad
I think it's today
Yeh
The boy that's driving me mad
is going away.

He's got a ticket to ride
He's got a ticket to ride
He's got a ticket to ride
and he don't care.

He said that living with me
was bringing him down
Yeh
He would never be free
when I was around.

He's got a ticket to ride
He's got a ticket to ride
He's got a ticket to ride
and he don't care.

Don't know why he's riding so high
He oughta do right

He oughta do right by me
Before he gets to saying goodbye
He oughta do right
He oughta do right by me

I think I'm gonna be sad
I think it's today
Yeh
The boy that's driving me mad
is going away.

He's got a ticket to ride
He's got a ticket to ride
He's got a ticket to ride
and he don't care
he don't care.
