Wanna pull an all nighter and get into something we'll never forget
Wanna stay up and party the weekend away and not know when to quit
Wanna drive in the night to the end of the earth and go over the edge
Wanna wake up with you and say, "Baby, let's do it all over again"


Lips so good I forget my name
I swear I could give you everything


I don't need my love, you can take it, you can take it, take it
I don't need my heart, you can break it, you can break it, break it
I just can't get too much of you, baby
It's never, it's never enough
Never enough
It's never enough
Never enough
Come on, come on


Wanna pull an all nighter and get into something we'll never forget
Wanna stay up and party the weekend away and not know when to quit
Wanna drive in the night to the end of the earth and go over the edge
Wanna wake up with you and say baby let's do it all over again


Lips so good I forget my name
I swear I could give you everything


I don't need my love, you can take it, you can take it, take it
I don't need my heart, you can break it, you can break it, break it
I just can't get too much of you, baby
It's never, it's never enough
Never enough
It's never enough
Never enough
Come on, come on
Come on, come on


Too much is never enough, too much is never enough
Too much is never enough, too much
Too much is never enough, too much is never enough
Too much is never enough, too much is never enough
It’s never enough, it’s never, it’s never, it’s never…


I don't need my love, you can take it, you can take it, take it
I don't need my heart, you can break it, you can break it, break it
I just can't get too much of you, baby
It's never, it's never enough
Never enough
I don't need my love, you can take it, you can take it, take it
I don't need my heart, you can break it, you can break it, break it
I just can't get too much of you, baby
It's never, it's never enough
Never enough
It's never enough
Never enough
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
