Turn the lights down low
And let the DJ go
Until the speakers blow
Stay up till the break of dawn!

Take a sip of Jack
You need a sip of that
There ain't no turning back


Hey! I don't care
I don't care
Whenever there's a party
I'm the first one with a drink in the air
Put em up, put em up!
We can share
Yeah!
Cause when we finish this one
There will be another bottle right here!

Heeeeeey 

When the basses low
You work it nice and slow
You let your body go
Shake it till the break of dawn!

You can take a shot
Of anything they got
Dance on the table top
But


Hey! I don't care
I don't care
Whenever there's a party
I'm the first one with a drink in the air
Put em up, put em up!
We can share
Yeah!
Cause when we finish this one
There will be another bottle right here!

Heeeeeey 


We don't want this night to end
We won't sleep
That we'll do it again
