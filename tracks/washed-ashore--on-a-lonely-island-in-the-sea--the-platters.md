(Washed ashore on a lonely island in the sea)
(Washed ashore on a lonely island in the sea)

Yeah girl
So many times you told me, baby
So many times you made me feel
That this love will last forever
And that this love was real

Ha!
But now the tide has changed
And all the love you stole
You took out of your sweet little heart
And just threw it overboard

(Washed ashore on a lonely island in the sea)
Yeah girl
(Washed ashore on a lonely island in the sea)

Oh yeah girl
My life is filled with emptiness baby
The sadness filled with tears
How long can I survive without ya, honey
How many lonely lonely years
I'm deserted on the isle of sadness
Where the forgetting is hard to do
Memories are eating my life away
Those memories of you

Yeah! yeah yeah girl
(Washed ashore on a lonely island in the sea)
No yeah, ha
(Washed ashore on a lonely island in the sea)

And with the love you tossed away
With all my heart and all my soul
Floating on a sea of shattered dreams
To a isle of tears and woe
No other love could rescue me, baby
From this isle of loneliness
Until you come and save me, baby
I'll be marooned like this

(Washed ashore on a lonely island in the sea)
Yeah yeah girl
(Washed ashore on a lonely island in the sea)
Oh washed ashore

Gone, gone, gone
With the love I had for you, baby
With all my heart and all my soul
I'll never let you go
