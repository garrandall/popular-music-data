January
Sick and tired, you've been hanging on me
You make me sad with your eyes
You're telling me lies
Don't go, don't go

January
Don't be cold, don't be angry to me
You make me sad, come and see
Oh, January
Don't go, don't go

Life gets me higher (Higher)
I can show, I can glow
I can wake up the world, little world
Gotta know you, gotta show you

Sun, like a fire (Fire)
Carry on, don't be gone
Bring me out of my home sweet home
Gotta know me, gotta show me
You've been facing the world
You've been chasing the world

January
Sick and tired, you've been hanging on me
You make me sad with your eyes
You're telling me lies
Don't go, don't go

January
Don't be cold, don't be angry to me
You make me sad, come and see
Oh, January
Don't go, don't go

Time, it's a flier (Flier)
Sunny day, fly away
English summers are gone, so long
Gotta go up, gotta blow up

Sun, like a fire (Fire)
Carry on, don't be gone
Bring me out of my home sweet home
Gotta know me, gotta show me
You've been facing the world
You've been chasing the world

January
Sick and tired, you've been hanging on me
You make me sad with your eyes
You're telling me lies
Don't go, don't go

January
Don't be cold, don't be angry to me
You make me sad, come and see
Oh, January
Don't go, don't go
