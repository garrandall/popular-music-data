Dis Is The Place Where You Belong
Right Here In My Arms
Without You Something Is Wrong

Misery
Such A Fool To Let You Walk Away From Me, Now It Seems It's Just Nobody There For Me
Girl I'm In Agony For You
Ohhh
Though Without A Trace
Never Knew That Live Was Such A Lonely Place, Damn I Need Your Loving Just To Fill The Space
I'm In So Much Pain Without You
Ohhh
You Let Me Here Alone
Why Don't You Come Back Home
To Me
Ohhh
Everybody Help Me Sing

Dis Is The Place Where You Belong
Right Here In My Arms (My Arms)
Without You Something Is Wrong

Waiting For Your Core
Can't Help Thinking That The Mess Is All By Far, And Just To Have You Back, I Swear I'd Risk It All
My Every Fall
Is You
Girl I'm On My Knees
Begging For Forgiveness And Your Sympathy, But Most Of All My Love
I'm At Your Comforting
The Only Thing I Need Is You
I Need You Back My Friend
So I Can Live
Come Back Home
Everybody Help Me Sing It




You Belong You Belong In My Arms
