When we're stuck in troubled days
We must learn to love each other
Instead of going different ways
We must try to get together

Fly little white dove, fly, way up high
Spread your wings, sing out your cry
'Cross the universal sky

If we love the Human race
Peace should be your aspiration
Let's make this a better place
Spread the word to every nation

Fly little white dove, fly, way up high
Spread your wings, sing out your cry
'Cross the universal sky

When a simple word is spoken
It should be our guiding light
If vows for peace are never broken
Then the whole world will unite

Fly little white dove, fly, way up high
Spread your wings, sing out your cry
'Cross the universal sky
(repeat until fade)
