A little past suppertime
I'm still out on the porch step sitting on my behind
Waiting for you

Wondering if everything is alright
Momma said, "Come in boy, don't waste your time." I said, "I've got time
Well, he'll be here soon."

Five years old and talking to myself
Where were you? Where'd you go?
Daddy, can't you tell?

I'm not trying to fake it
And I ain't the one to blame
There's no one home
In my house of pain
I didn't write these pages
And my script's been rearranged
No, there's no one home
In my house of pain

Wasn't I worth the time?
A boy needs a daddy like a dance to mime and all the time
I looked up to you

I paced my room a million times
And all I ever got was on big line, the same old lie
How could you?

Well, I was eighteen and still talking to myself
Where were you? Where'd you go?
Daddy can't you tell?

I'm not trying to fake it
And I ain't the one to blame
There's no one home
In my house of pain
I didn't write these pages
And my script's been rearranged
No, there's no one home
In my house of pain

I'm not trying to fake it
And I ain't the one to blame
There's no one home
In my house of pain
I didn't write these pages
And my script's been rearranged
No, there's no one home
In my house of pain

And I'm alone again


Well, if I learned anything from this...it's how to live on my own
