I don't fool around on my baby
And he don't fool around on me
And I know when I need him
He'll be there for me

Ooh
And if he asks me some questions
Well, I don't tell him lies
And I don't have the need
The need for alibis

I don't know how
Love will survive
But it's all right for now

Still I believe
Love will show us how
There must be a way
To keep it alive

And so keep our vows
And I believe
Love will show us how
Still I believe
Love will show us how

I don't know how
Love will survive
But it's all right for now

Still I believe
Love will show us how
There must be a way
To keep it alive

And so keep our vows
And I believe
Love will show us how
Still I believe
Love will show us how
