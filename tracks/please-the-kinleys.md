(Tony haselden)

There ain't no easy way to start this conversation
So I'll just say what's on my mind
Once our hearts both shared a common destination
To love until the end of time

Lately we've been drifting further from each other
Someone's gotta take the wheel
I won't wait until it's too late to recover
So let me tell you how I feel

I'll do anything if it'll bring our hearts together
I'll stand and fight or get down on my knees
If we can fix what's wrong and just go on in love forever
Baby I'll be beggin' please

I'm strong enough to handle any situation
But honey true love has no pride
So I can say without a moments hesitation
Before I'll let you say goodbye

I'll do anything if it'll bring our hearts together
I'll stand and fight or get down on my knees
If we can fix what's wrong and just go on in love forever
Baby I'll be beggin' please

Boy you know your love's my one true weakness
When it comes to you I'm helpless

I'll do anything if it'll bring our hearts together
I'll stand and fight or get down on my knees
If we can fix what's wrong and just go on in love forever
Baby I'll be beggin' please... please
