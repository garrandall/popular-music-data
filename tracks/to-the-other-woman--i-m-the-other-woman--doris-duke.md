My friends all ask me
If I know the real you
I say, yes, I know my man
And all about his other woman
So, to see, there's nothing new

(Tell me something different)

They say, please, don't get offended
They're only trying to help me
So I won't mess up my life

But they don't know
To the other woman
I'm the other woman
And other woman is his wife

Everybody calls me stupid
For playing second fiddle
At least I know I'm number two

But all you so-called friends
With your supposedly single men
Tell me, what number are you

If there's any
Backstabbing being done
I'm the guilty one
She has no reason for the knife

But they don't know
To the other woman
I'm the other woman
And other woman, she's his wife

I'm gonna try and keep this man
In every way that I can
Cause he means the world to me
Yes, he does

But I won't be his degredation
And come between his obligations
To his wife and family, oh, no

Cause one door will close
I won't see anymore
But like the old folks say
That's life

To him, I'll just've
Been another woman
And the other woman
Will always be his wife
Yes, she will

To the other woman
She'll be his wife
I'm the other woman...
