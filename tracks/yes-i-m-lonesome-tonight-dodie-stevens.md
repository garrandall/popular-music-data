Yes I'm lonesome tonight
And I miss you tonight
I'm so sorry we drifted apart

And my memories strains
To those wonderful days
When you kissed me
And called me sweetheart

All the chairs in the parlor
Seem empty and bare
As I gaze at the doorstep
And picture you there

Now my heart's filled with pain
Take me back once again
Yes my dear
I'm so lonesome tonight

Yes my darling
I'm lonesome tonight
I realize now that world is a stage
And each of us must play a part

I know too that
Fate sometimes acts in strange ways
Yes, Act One is where we met
And I too loved you at first glance
But I guess I didn't really read my lines too well

Then came Act Two
Heh, I've never changed
There was a misunderstanding
I know now that I shouldn't have you listen to a so-called friend

The truth is, my love
That she wanted you for her own
You don't really have to doubt me
Nor must you go on without me

Yes, the stage is bare
But please wait there
Because I'm coming to you darling
And we'll be together
When they bring the curtain down

Now my heart's filled with pain
Take me back once again
Yes my dear
I'm so lonesome tonight
