Just do it
Just dop it do it do it
Just do it rock to it
Put ya hands up high and move it


Sometimes i feel weird throw verbal spears like brittany
That literally go from here to houstanb just like whitney
Battle me ya kiddin me you a funny cat
I bet 50 cents for eminems ya wont get a nickelback
The track im rippin aint really that hard
See jesus gives destiny to every child of God
Im battle scarred kind of raw but what did youu think?
No matter race religion or the color or the creed.
If ya black brown pink or in or out if sync
Or hang w/ the beastie boys just on the backstreet
You can live in linkin park no matter just to me
See the prince of peace is guranteed to give ya what you need.




One day these peepe were going past me
Walking w/ a limp eating bizkits they hair was all shaggy
I said whats all yall name is the? that im asking
I'm Michael, that celine, thats dion thats Feldick
Thats rickey thats martin thats tony and thats Braxton
Dru is on the hill just chillin and relaxing.
Alicia lost her keys and shes really kind of sad and

I said u2 no doubt i know how that be happening
But i need all the Dixie chicks to gather in
And let me explain just the reason why im rapping and
So i told mariah he carried my sin and died for me
My faith is in christ who on hill called calvary
Gave his life for mine so genuine i try to be
If the world tries to stop me i rage against the machine
So i turn ya radio up and head to the spot
Get loose like a slipknot whatch the kid rock.




My uncle was eating korn on a cracker all alone
It was 98 Deagrees put he was out counting crows
And it was just then when my papa saw a roach
He dropped his Red hot chili peppers and then he ran home
And just went and called up John the Mayor on the phone
Its a 311 3 doors down now dont be slow
But he was like wait a second hold up a minute bro.
Before i Usher over theirs something you should know

Jesus is the firm rock not a Rolling Stone
W/ him heaven not Nirvanah is where youll go
I try to show and let ya know but ya Third eye is blind
So need to open them up real wide
Even if u have to blink 182 times
Its soo obvious that it cant hide
TLC tender loving care he'll provide
From girls to boys To Men need to let him inside
