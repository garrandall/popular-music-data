She walks in and I'm suddenly a hero
I'm taken in
My hopes begin to rise


Look at me
Can't you tell
I'd be so thrilled to see
The message in your eyes?


You make it seem I'm so close to my dream
And then suddenly it's all there



Suddenly

The wheels are in motion
And I
I'm ready to sail any ocean
Suddenly, I don't need the answers
'Cause I
I'm ready to take all my chances with you



And how can I
Feel you're all that matters?
I'd rely on anything you say


I'll take care that no illusions shatter
If you dare to say what you should say


You make it seem I'm so close to my dream
And then suddenly it's all there



Suddenly

The wheels are in motion
And I
I'm ready to sail any ocean
Suddenly, I don't need the answers
'Cause I
I'm ready to take all my chances with you



Why do I feel so alive when you're near?
There's no way any hurt can get through

Longing to spend every moment of the day with you
With you



Suddenly

The wheels are in motion
And I
I'm ready to sail any ocean
Suddenly, I don't need the answers
'Cause I
I'm ready to take all my chances with you
