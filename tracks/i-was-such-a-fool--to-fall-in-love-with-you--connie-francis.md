I was such a fool to fall in love with you
I was such a fool to think you loved me, too
"Cause suddenly something happened
Your love flickered and died
But mine... mine kept right on burning
Then burst into a tide
Impossible to hide

Oh, I was such a fool to think that you were mine
Here's to your new love
Let's drink a toast of sparkling wine
Oh, you taught me a lesson, it's true
But wait till it happens to you

Oh, I was such a fool to fall in love with you
Oh ho you know
You taught me a lesson, it's true
But wait till it happens to you
I was such a fool to fall in love with you
