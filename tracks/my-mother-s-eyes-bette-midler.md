"I think I'll sing you a little ballad. 
It's a new one. I just learnt it. 
Oh, I hope you like it."

Got my mother's eyes and my father's hair.
Does anybody really care?
It's gettin' cold out here.

Well, I keep walkin' with my head held high,
with my head to the sky,
with my mother's eyes.

And my mother's eyes are with me
in the darkness that's been paid for.
I'm just a nameless stranger, don't know why.

Have I seen all that I could?
Have I seen more than I should
with my mother's eyes?

Have I seen all that I could?
Have I seen more than I should
with my mother's eyes?

And my mother's eyes are with me
in the chilly winds of autumn.
If I ain't here by winter, she'll know why.

I've seen all that I dare.
I've seen more than my share.
Forgive me if I stare with my mother's eyes.
