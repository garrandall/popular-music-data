Have you ever wished upon a star
And all your hopes seemed so far
Well, here's a wish that will come true
And all these wishes are just for you

I wish I knew how it
Feel to be free, yessiree
I wish I could break all
Of these chains, oh, yes
That are really holding me

Wish I could say all the things
I should say every day
And say em loud, say em clear
For the whole wide world to hear

I wish I could share all the love
That I have in my heart today
And then move all the bars that
Keep the people in the world astring

I wish I could give all the joy
Everybody could see
Then they'd know, then they'd know
Every man in this world should be free

Listen, I wish I could give all the love
That I have in my heart, right now, today
I wish that I could help someone who
Was sad and is somewhere going astray

And most of all, I wish I had the
Answer and the secret to peace
I'd give this to every leader of the world
And then I wish I had the secret of love
For I'd share this with every man
Every woman, every boy and every girl

Oh, I wish I could fly
Like a bird up in the sky
And then wake up one morning
To find out for myself, oh
You don't even have to die

Listen, I'd fly if I could fly, you see
To the sun and then down
To the deep blue sea
Then I'd sing, yes
I'd sing about freedom

I want everybody to
Come sing along with me
Let me hear you just sing it one time

Let me hear you say
I'd sing, yes, I'd sing, come on
Sing, children, sing about love now
Sing, sing, sing about peace
Sing, sing, sing about the joy
Sing, sing, sing, ohh...
