Hey, baby, where you going?
Now wait a minute
You can't leave now

Now we been through this before
And I'm tired, that's right
Sick and tired of the
Same old thing over and over

You're a runaway love
You're a runaway love
You're a runaway love
You're a runaway love

You're slick here
Playing with my feelings
You keep messing 'round
Playing with my heart

I find the things that you say
They don't have no meaning
And that is why I know
We're gonna have to part

You're a runaway love
You're a runaway love
You're a runaway love
You're a runaway love

Oh, stop playing with my heart
If you don't mean it
And stop playing with my love
If you don't care

Don't go around making jokes
'Bout how you're using me
'Cause I ain't got no
Heartaches to spare

You're a runaway love
You're a runaway love
(Just-a keep on running away)

(Run away, run away)
You're a runaway love
(Running, running, running)
You're a runaway love

Don't come around
Holding me and kissing me
Talking all that jive
And getting my feelings up

If you're leaving me and running
Off to someone else's arms
Breaking up my heart and soul
And leaving me stuck

With all my tears
Heartaches and emotions
I'm all hung up with
Love and devotions

So stop messing with my heart
If you don't mean it
And stop messing with my love
If you don't care

Don't come here
Talking 'bout loving, no
You are using me
'Cause I ain't got no
Heartaches to spare

You're a runaway love
(Just a-running, just a-running)
(In and out of my life)
You're a runaway love
(Where you gonna)
(Run to this time, baby?)

You're a runaway love
(You can go if you want to)
(You can go, you can go)
You're a runaway love
(Don't come back next time)

Ow, get down, uh-huh
Yeah, shake it
Uh-huh, do your thing
Don't you feel it
Don't you feel it, yeah, yeah

Don't come around
Holding me and kissing me
Talking all that jive
And getting my feelings up

Then leaving me and running
Off to someone else's arms
Breaking up my heart and soul
And leaving me stuck

With all my tears
My heartaches and emotions
I'm all hung up with
Love and devotions

So stop messing with my heart
If you don't mean it
Hey, stop messing with my love
If you don't care

Don't come here
Talking 'bout love and
You know you're using me
Baby, I ain't got no
Heartaches to spare

You're a runaway love
(Just a-running, just a-running)
(In and out of my life)
You're a runaway love
(Just a-running, keep on running)
(Run away from love)

You're a runaway love
(Just a-running, you keep running)
(Where you going?)
(Where, where you going?)
You're a runaway love
(Just a-running, just a-running)

Come here, no
Don't start that over again
You wanna leave
You go ahead and leave

It ain't gonna
Bother me no more
'Cause I'm going out
And I'm gonna get down

I'm tired of sitting here
And waiting for you to come home
And you out someplace with somebody else
I'm gonna go out and find me somebody

Yeah, gonna go dancing
Gonna go dancing, hey
I can still do it, you know
You ain't gotta be here
For me to be doing this

Yeah, go ahead
And run if you want to
Go ahead, like I said
You ain't go to stay
