From Cape Cod Light to the Mississip', to San Francisco Bay
They're talkin' 'bout this famous place, down Greenwich Village way
They hootenanny all the time with folks from everywhere
Come Sunday morning, rain or shine, right in Washington Square
An' so I got my banjo out, jes' sittin', catchin' dust
An' painted right across the case: "Greenwich Village or Bust!"
My folks were sad to see me go, but I got no meanin' there
So I said, "Goodbye, Kansas, Mo. And hello, Washington Square!"
Near Tennessee, I met a guy who played 12-string guitar
He also had a mighty voice, not to mention a car
Each time he hit those bluegrass chords, you sure smelled mountain air
I said, "Don't waste it on the wind. C'mon to Washington Square."
In New Orleans, we saw a gal a-walkin' with no shoes
An' from her throat there comes a growl, she sure was singin' the blues
She sang for all humanity, this gal with raven hair
I said, "It's for the world to hear, C'mon to Washington Square."
We cannonballed into New York on good old US 1
Till up ahead we saw the arch, a-gleamin' bright in the sun
As far as all the eye could see, ten thousand folks was there
And singin' in sweet harmony right in Washington Square
Say how's about a freedom song, or the ole' "Rock Island Line"!
Or how's about the dust-bowl crop, or men who work in a mine?
The songs and legends of our land is gold we all can share
So come and join us folks who stand and sing in Washington Square
