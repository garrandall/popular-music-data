When it all goes crazy and the thrill is gone
The days get rainy and the nights get long
When you get that feelin' you were born to lose
Staring at your ceiling thinkin' of your blues

When there's so much trouble that you wanna cry
The world has crumbled and you don't know why
When your hopes are fading and they can't be found
Dreams have left you waiting, friends have let you down

Just remember I love you
And it'll be alright
Just remember I love you
More than I can say
Maybe then your blues will fade away

When you need a lover and you're down so low
Start to wonder, but you never know
When it feels like sorrow is your only friend
Knowing that tomorrow you'll feel this way again

When the blues come callin' at the break of dawn
Rain keeps fallin', but the rainbow's gone
When you feel like crying but the tears won't come
When your dreams are dyin', when you're on the run

Just remember I love you
And it'll be alright
Just remember I love you
More than I can say
Just remember I love you
And it'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
