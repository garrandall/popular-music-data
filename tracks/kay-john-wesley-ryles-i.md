From: Jerry Ann
Lyrics added by: Rick Apple

"KAY"

Writer: Hank Mills

(Note: The chord chart I have is in E flat. I am using the small letter "b" to denote
Flats with the capital letters as chords. The small "m" means minor, and the "M" is
Major. Hope this is not confusing. Enjoy! JAM)
(Verse 1)
KAY WITH ALL YOUR SINGING TALENT BACK IN HOUSTON
NASHVILLE'S ALL YOU TALKED ABOUT
I SOLD EVERYTHING I OWNED TO BRING YOU HERE
NOW YOU'LL BE FAMOUS, THERE'S NO DOUBT
LAST NIGHT YOU KNOCKED EM' OUT IN NEW YORK
TONIGHT CHICAGO'S GOING WILD
G7Cm
KAY YOUR NEW RECORD ON THE JUKEBOX DON'T SOUND BAD
KAY I'M LIVING YET I'M DYING STARING OUT
AT MUSIC CITY FROM MY CAB

(Verse 2)
CAUTION LIGHTS BLINK OUT THEIR WARNING
SOME OLD BIG BEN CLOCK CHIMES 3 A. M.
STARVIN HOUND DOGS SEARCH THE TRASH CANS
MY GAS TANK COULD STAND A DOLLER'S WORTH AGAIN
ALL THOSE CHUCK-HOLES HERE ON MAIN ST
JAR MY RIB CAGE I COULD CUSS
KAY THE CROWD OF NIGHT LIFE PEOPLE LOOK SO SAD
KAY I'M LIVING YET IM DYING STARING OUT
AT MUSIC CITY FROM MY CAB.

(Verse 3)
TWO YOUNG SOLDIERS FROM FT. CAMPBELL
TOLD ME HOW THEY HATE THAT WAR IN VIET NAM
SIRENS ECHOED THRU AN ALLEY AND SOME WOMAN
SAID SOME FELLOW STABBED A MAN.
I RUSHED MISS TEENAGE TO A DR.
SHE BEGGED TO GIVE THE CHILD MY NAME
I'VE LOST COUNT OF CUPS OF COFFEE THAT I'VE HAD
KAY I'M LIVING YET I'M DYING
STARING OUT AT MUSIC CITY FROM MY CAB.

(BRIDGE)
GUITARS, ORGANS, HORNS, VIOLINS, AND PIANOS
HOW THEY PLAY
BbEb
GRINDING OUT THE LATEST SOUNDS FROM MUSIC CITY U.S.A.
KAY ALTHO' I KNOW I'VE LOST YOU
TO THE SWINGING MUSIC WORLD
I KISS THE PICTURES OF THE HAPPY TIMES WE'VE HAD
AbM EbAb
KAY I'M LIVING, YET I'M DYING STARING OUT
AT MUSIC CITY FROM MY CAB

(Verse 4)
THREE ROSE PETALS ON MY FRONT SEAT
FALLEN FROM THE BOUQUET JIMMY TOOK TO JUNE
JIM KEPT MUMBLING THROUGH HIS TEARDROPS
GOD SHE'LL LEAVE THIS WORLD WITH FLOWERS IN HER ROOM
KAY I SHOWED SOME DRUNK YOUR PICTURE
AND HE MADE SOME SMART REMARK
SO I HIT HIM IN THE MOUTH
BOY WAS I MAD
KAY I'M LIVING YET I'M DYING STARING OUT
AT MUSIC FROM MY CAB

(Repeat BRIDGE)
