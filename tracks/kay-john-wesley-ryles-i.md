Kay, with all your singing talent back in Houston Nashville's all you talked about
I sold everything I owned to bring you here now you'll be famous, there's no doubt
Last week you knocked 'em out in New York tonight Chicago's going wild
Your record on the jukebox don't sound bad
Kay, I'm living yet I'm dying staring out at Music City from my cab

Caution lights blink out their warning some old Big Ben clock chimes 3 a.m.
Starving hound dogs search the trash can my gas tank could use ten dollars worth again
All those potholes here on Main Street jar my rib cage I could cuss
The crowd of nightlife people look so sad
Kay, I'm living yet I'm dying staring out at Music City from my cab

Two young soldiers from Fort Campbell told me how they won the war in Afghanistan
Sirens echoed through an alley, some woman said somebody stabbed a man
I rushed Miss Teenage to the doctor, she begged to give the child my name
I can't count of cups of coffee that I've had
Kay, I'm living yet I'm dying staring out at Music City from my cab

Three rose petals on my front seat fallen from the bouquet Jimmy took to June
Jim kept mumbling through his teardrops God she'll leave this world with flowers in her room
Kay, I showed some drunk your picture and he made some smart remark
I hit him in the mouth boy was I mad
Kay, I'm living yet I'm dying staring out at Music City from my cab

Fiddles, steel guitars and pianos, how they play
Grinding out the latest sounds from Music City USA
Kay, although I know I've brought you to the swinging music world
I miss pictures of those happy times we've had
Kay, I'm living yet I'm dying staring out at Music City from my cab
Kay, I'm living yet I'm dying staring out at Music City from my cab
