You got me some type of way (hm)
Ain't used to feelin' this way (hm-hm)
I do not know what to say (yeah, yeah)
But I know I shouldn't think about it
Took one fuckin' look at your face (hm)
Now I wanna know how you taste (hm-hm)
Usually don't give it away (yeah, yeah)
But you know I'm out here thinkin' 'bout it

Then I realize she's right there
And I'm at home like, "Damn, this ain't fair"

Break up with your girlfriend
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You can hit in the mornin' (mornin')
Yeah, yeah, like it's yours
I know it ain't right
But I don't care (care)
Break up with your girlfriend
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored

This shit always happens to me (yeah)
Why can't we just play for keeps? (hm-hm)
Practically on my knees (yeah, yeah)
But I know I shouldn't think about it
You know what you're doin' to me
You're singin' my songs in the streets, yeah, yeah
Actin' all innocent, please
When I know you're out here thinkin' 'bout it

Then you realize she's right there (yeah)
And you're at home like, "Damn, she can't compare"

Break up with your girlfriend
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You can hit in the mornin' (in the mornin')
Yeah, yeah, like it's yours
I know it ain't right
But I don't care (I don't care, yee)
Break up with your girlfriend (with your girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored

With your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend
With your girlfriend
With your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend

You can say I'm hatin' if you want to
But I only hate on her 'cause I want you
Say I'm trippin' if you feel that
But you without me ain't right (ain't right)
You can call me crazy 'cause I want you
And I never even ever fuckin' met you
Say I'm trippin' and it ain't right
But you without me ain't nice (ain't nice, yeah)

Break up with your girlfriend (with your girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You can hit in the mornin' (hit in the mornin', yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, like it's yours
I know it ain't right
But I don't care (care, yeah)
Break up with your girlfriend (with your girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored

With your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, baby, girlfriend
With your girlfriend
With your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend
With your girlfriend
