Woah, if I write (It's JoeFromYO)
If I write you, girl, will you reply? (Go Grizz)
Follow my commands, come on, girl, comply
You only want me 'cause my life's televised
And I can see all them lies in your eyes
But I'm no different, selling dreams for tonight
Just so I could have my way, rubbin' on your thighs
In the morning, go back home because I do not have no ties


Yeah, but if I (But if I)
If I write you, girl, tell me, would you reply? (Would you reply?)
You know I used to be a thief up in the night (Yeah, yeah)
And you don't want that type of guy in your life
But what if I put on a disguise for the night? (Yeah, yeah)
What if I was to put my life up on the line? (On the line)
Don't pay no mind to them bitches, like a ticket, you're fine
Gave you a shoulder to lean on for when you cry


Uh, cry for me, for me now
No one can slow me down
I stay with forty rounds
Hit her off a Perc', gave her forty rounds
Woah, I'm far from finished, I'm not done
I keep grabbing on her waist, she tryna run
Put my foot into it 'til she numb
Every time she moan, she be like, "Uh"
Uh, she switched up for the same dollar
She don't know the rules of the game 'cause she ain't have no father
Me and Artist, yeah, we know some of the same scholars
Me and Artist go home and we got the same problems
And we keep arguing about them same bodies
That's because you is my girl, you is my main body
Take you serious, you know I will not play about it
And if you wanna get better, baby, just pray about it


I play about it, but don't you go be fake about it
Just play your part and I won't ever complain about it
Should have called you beautiful more before you changed your body
Then you did your body, girl, yeah, you really changed about it


It's couples out here that's not eatin', we got plain scallops
And clam chowder, you gon' be raising my damn toddler
And I can't lie, baby girl, it ain't no way around you
Ain't nothin' to say about it, got niggas pull up and spray about it
I'm gone


Yeah, and when I say, "I'm gone"
Don't just say it right after me like it's some sing-along shit
You got mad when I said you could bring your friend along, yeah
I'm gon' fuck you to this, make this one your favorite song
And you even look sexy with no makeup on
And you ain't gotta ask me, girl, just take it off
I knew that you was nasty the way you take it raw
I just hope that you don't think I'm crazy, girl


If I
Woah, if I write
If I write you, girl, tell me, would you reply?
You know I used to be a thief up in the night
You only want me 'cause my life's televised
But what if I put on a disguise for the night?
And I can see all the lies in your eyes (Yeah, yeah)
You don't want this type of guy, right
In the morning, go back home because I do not have no ties (Yeah)


Woah, if I write
If I write you, girl, tell me would you reply?
Yeah, if I write you, can you reply?
