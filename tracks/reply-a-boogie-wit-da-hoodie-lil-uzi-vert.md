Woah, if I write
If I write you, girl, will you reply
Follow my commands, c'mon girl, comply
You only want me 'cause my life's televised
And I can see all the lies in your eyes
But I'm no different selling dreams for tonight
Just so I can have my way, rubbing on your thighs
In the morning go back home because I do not have no ties

Yeah, but if I, but if I write you, girl, tell me would you reply
You know I used to be a thief up in the night
You don't want that type of guy in your life
But what if I put on a disguise for the night?
What if I was to put my life up on the line?
Don't pay no mind to them bitches, like a ticket you're fine
Gave you a shoulder to lean on for when you cry

Cry for me, for me now
No one can slow me down
I stay with forty rounds
Hit her off of Perc, gave her forty rounds
Woah, I'm far from finished, I'm not done
I keep grabbing on her waist, she tryna run
Put my foot into her tushie now
Every time she moans, she be like, "Uhh"
Uh, she switched up for the same dollar
She don't know the rules of the game 'cause she ain't have no father
Me and Artist, yeah, we know some of the same scholars
Me and Artist go home and we got the same problems
And we keep arguing about them same bodies
That's because you is my girl, you is my main body
Take you serious, you know I will not play about it
And if you wanna get better baby, just pray about it

I play your body but don't you be fake about it
Just play your part and I won't ever complain about it
Should have called you beautiful more before you changed your body
And you did yo' body, girl, yeah, you really changed the body

There's couples out here that's not eating, we got plain scallops
And clam chowder, you gon' be raising my damn toddler
And I can't lie, baby girl, there ain't no way around it
Ain't nothing to say about it, got niggas pull up and spray about it

I'm gone, yeah, and when say I'm gone
Don't just say it right after me like it's some sing along shit
You got mad when I said you could bring your friend along, yeah
I'm gon' fuck you to this, make this one your favorite song
And you even look sexy with no makeup on
And you ain't gotta ask me, girl, just take it off
I knew that you was nasty when you take it rough
I just hope that you don't think I'm crazy girl

If I, woah, if I write
If I write you, girl, tell me would you reply?
You know I used to be a thief up in the night
You only want me 'cause my life's televised
What if I put on a disguise for the night?
And I can see all the lies in your eyes
You don't want this type of guy in your life
In the morning go back home because I do not have no ties
Woah, if I write
If I write you, girl, tell me would you reply?
Yeah, if I write you can you reply?
