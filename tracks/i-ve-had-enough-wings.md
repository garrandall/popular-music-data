You're talking to me from the back of the car
And I can't get nothing right
And then you wonder why I stand at the bar
Day and night

I've had enough
I can't put up with any more
No no no no no no no
I've had enough
I can't put up with any more
No no no no no no no

You stand behind me with a watch in your hand
And I can't get nothing done
Well people tell me you're a punctual man
But come on

I've had enough
I can't put up with any more
No no no no no no no
I've had enough
I can't put up with any more
No no no no no no no

I earn the money and you take it away

When I don't know where you're from
I should be worried but they say
It'll pay for a bomb

I've had enough
I can't put up with any more
No no no no no no no
I've had enough
I can't put up with any more
No no no no no no no

I've had enough

Baby you know sometimes you get a little weary
But if it ever happens honey
You must come along to me
Because you know

I've had enough
I can't put up with any more
No no no no no no no
I've had enough
I can't put up with any more
No no no no no no no
