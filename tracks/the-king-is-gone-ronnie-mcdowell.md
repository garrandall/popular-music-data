I was barely six years old when I first heard him sing
But somehow I knew, from that moment on...
That it would be a lifetime thing
And Id stand in front of a mirror...
Day and night
And Id listen to every one of his records
And Id repeat every word...
And every note...
...till, somehow, I finally got it right...

And I was determined....
Id wait for the day...
That I could stand and sing in front of an audience
And maybe someoned come up to ME and say...
Yknow, you sound just like Elvis...

There was man
Who gave the world his song
And the world stood still
To hear him sing...

A simple man
Who took his faith along
While all the world
Proclaimed him king...

Now the King is gone...
And, oh, what a reign...
And the crown on his head
Will remain

From a workin man
To royalty
To everlasting fame...

The King is gone
The King is gone

Long live his name...

The was a man...
Who tasted sweet success
Top40db.org
But still gave his hand
To help a friend...

A Lovin man...
Who shared his happiness
Now the the King is gone
But THERE was a man...

Now the King is gone
And, oh, what a reign
And the crown on his head
Long will remain

From a workin man
To royalty
To everlasting fame...

The King is gone
Oh, the King is gone

Long live his name

Yeah, the King is gone...
Oh, the King is gone...

Long live...
His name..

Gbye Elvis...
Well miss yah...
