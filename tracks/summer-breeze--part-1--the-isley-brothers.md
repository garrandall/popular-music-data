Ah-ha-ha, yeah
Summer Breeze, all in my mind
Ah-ha, yeah
Summer Breeze, all in my mind
No-no-no-no, it's all in my mind
No-no-no-no, it's all in my mind


Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' though the jasmine in my mind


See the curtains hangin' in the window
In the evening on a Friday night
A little light shinin' through the window
Lets me know every-everything's all right


Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' though the jasmine in my mind


Sweet days of summer, the jasmine's in bloom
July is dressed up and playing her tune
When I come home from a hard day's work
And you're waitin' there
Not a care in the world

See the smile awaitin' in the kitchen
Through cookin' and the plates for two
Feel the arms that reach out to hold me
In the evening when the day is through


Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' though the jasmine in my mind


Ah, summer breeze
