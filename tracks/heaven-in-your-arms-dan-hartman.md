Here I go falling in love again
I don't think I can stop it
And I know that it might hurt
But I can't do without it

Losing sleep, I toss and I turn
I wonder if you're aware
That I'm thinking of you, can't you see
You're the only one in my fantasy

Oh-oh it must be heaven in your arms
I don't doubt it now
Oh-oh it must be heaven in your arms
I need to know it now
Oh-oh it must be heaven in your arms
Oh yeah

I'm alone, don't want no one else
I roam the streets of the city
I call you up from the payphone nearby
But you say you're too busy

You gotta run out in the night
Come my way, I'll hold you tight

Oh-oh it must be heaven in your arms
I don't doubt it now
Oh-oh it must be heaven in your arms
I need to know, whoa

Oh-oh
Oh-oh
(Ah-ah-ah)

Oh, I can live forever
In a moment of your love
You said I seem like a long lost, lonely boy
But you know what I'm in need of (it must be heaven in your arms)
It must be heaven in your arms (must be heaven in your arms)
Oh, it must be heaven in your arms (must be heaven in your arms)
It must be heaven in your arms (must be heaven in your arms)
I believe, I believe, it must be heaven, don't you know

(Must be heaven in your arms)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (must be heaven in your arms)
(Ah, must be heaven in your arms)
La, la, la, la (oh)
