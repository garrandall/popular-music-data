Completely, wanna give my love, completely
I'd rather be alone than be in love just half the way
I want to find someone that I can trust, completely
Wanna give my heart, completely
To someone who'll completely give their heart to only me
And when I find that one
That's when I'll fall in love


Completely
Not half but whole
With heart and soul
Completely, not in between
But everything
Completely
That's the way it's got to be
The way I want someone to fall in love with me

Forever, wanna feel the word, forever
And know there'll be somebody there forever by my side
And when that feeling comes
That's when I'll give my love



It's all or nothing at all for this heart of mine
And I won't give up this heart until the day I find
Someone who can be
Someone who loves me
