By the side of the tracks where the train goes by
The wind and rain will catch you, you will sigh
Deep in your heart
Then you'll come running to me, mmm mmm mmm
You'll come a-running to me, yeah yeah


Well you watch the train go 'round the bend
Play in dust and dream that it will never end
Deep in your heart
You'll come running to me, yeah yeah
You'll come a-running to me, alright


Said, hey, come a-running to me
Oh, come a-running to me
Hey, yeah, come a-running to me
Said, hey, come a-running to me
Oh, come a-running to me
Hey, yeah, come a-running to me


With your hound dog by your side
And your arms stretched out open wide
I wanna keep you satisfied in the morning sun
By my side, come on, come on run
All right, hey, in the country


You kick the sand up with your heels
Think to yourself how good it feels
Put away all your walking shoes
Then you come running to me, hey yeah
Now you come running to me, mmm mmm


I said, hey, come a-running to me
Oh, come a-running to me
Hey, yeah, come a-running to me
Hey, yeah, come a-running to me
Oh, come a-running to me
Hey, yeah, come a-running to me


Come on, come on run
(Hey, come a-running to me)
Wanna run, come on run
(Oh, come a-running to me)
Oh, come on run (Hey, yeah come a-running to me)
(Hey, yeah come a-running to me)
Come on, run to me

You gotta rainbow if you run to me
