It's good to See the sun and trace the miles of golden corn
To walk the sacred ground where I was born
To touch the morning glories upon the hills we used to climb
To see your face after all this time

From the long lonesome road I come to greet you
From the land where the restless hearts roam
I've come back to tell you just how much I need you
And that your wayward lover has come home

So fine to lay in fields beneath the arc of heaven's light
To hold you in my arms deep into the night
So glad to know your heart has not grown bitter with the years
To see forgiveness in your moonlit tears

From the long lonesome road I come to greet you
From the land where the restless hearts roam
I've come back to tell you just how much I need you
And that your wayward lover has come home

Once I left a girl crying beneath an old willow tree
Just thought she might be waiting there for me

From the land where angel fear to stray
It took a million miles to know how much I want you
And that your wayward lover's here to stay
