You're young and in love
And you think it's just enough
To keep you satisfied until forever
But what good is love
When it keeps you out of touch
With the very things that keep it all together

The longer you wait
The days are getting shorter
The farther your drift from the shore
The longer you wait
To rise and look around you
It may not be there anymore

You say you're seventeen
And you swear you've got a dream
And if the wind is right it's gonna find you
But what good is a dream
Without a dream machine
To take you through the obstacles that bind you

The longer you wait
The days are getting shorter
The farther your drift from the shore
The longer it takes
To rise and look around you
It may not be there anymore

Don't need his arms to hold you tight (hold you tight)
Oh yes those arms can hold you right
Don't let his dry those clear blue eyes
Cause you know he's gonna getcha, you know my sweet Loretta
You know he's gonna let down in the end end

The longer you wait
The days are getting shorter
The farther your drift from the shore
So don't hesitate
To rise and look around you
Just pick yourself up off the floor

The longer you wait
It may not be there anymore
The longer you wait
Just pick yourself up off the floor
The longer you wait
