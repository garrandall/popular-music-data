It ain't easy, girls, it ain't easy
To keep the man you love satisfied (No, no)
It ain't easy, girls, it ain't easy
To keep the one you love by your side

A woman's work is never done
Even if it stops, it goes on and on
We work our fingers to the bone
Gotta be home every time he'd phone

Some times the goin' gets a little tough
It's seems our best ain't good enough
Keeps you losin' sleep
Seven days a week, yeah

It ain't easy, girls, it ain't easy
To keep the man you love satisfied (No, no)
It ain't easy, girls, it ain't easy
To keep the one you love by your side

To keep him happy you must sacrifice
Be ready and willin' to face lonely nights
Do all you can and though he seems ungrateful
Love your man true though he seems unfaithful

But when his hope is gone and life gets him down
That's when he'll say he needs you around
It's hard to live with him
Hard to live without him, hey

It ain't easy

Hey, hey, hey

It ain't easy, girls, it ain't easy
It ain't easy, girls, it ain't easy

You got to baby them with understandin'
When understandin' is what they need
We try hard to give them respect
All that we get is their neglect

But when their troubled, they need our love and care
No matter when, we gotta be right there
In between the cryin', gotta keep tryin', yeah

It ain't easy, girls, it ain't easy (No)
It ain't easy, girls, it ain't easy
