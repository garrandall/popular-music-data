Y'all need to open your ears up and soak this game up
If nobody don't know ya I'm gunna make you famous
This is 24 karats but it shine like stainless
Just look at how the diamonds compliment my fingers

Yes indeed Shit chokin' me (whoo)
I need a breath to breathe
Chasin' with the Hennessey now thats how a G play
Especially when them hoes shakin' that ass and a DJ
Hip hop had do it big give him some leway
N security stop trippin' and you niggas be easy
Yes sir its the bubble right hurr
Yall beautiful women if you insecure


Let me see you work that, Twurk that, sur that c'mon and do the rodeo
Let me see you bounce that, move that, do that let me see you do the rodeo
Let me see you work that, Twurk that, sur that c'mon and do the rodeo
Let me see you bounce that, move that, do that let me see you do the rodeo

Its like you don't even have nuttin' on
Got errbody watchin' you so you can show that thong
Its your birthday lil mama get your Kodak on
But don't quit showin' the world you gunna throw that song
We ain't beefin' like nah we on the positive vibe
But I still get the homicide squad on the side
See I'm holdin' on to the steering wheel controllin' the ride
And yall comin' out a bumpin' cuz I got it in drive
I'm really feelin' your outfit it must be nice
A hard worker like myself could afford that price
I can't deny that you's a beautiful bitch
You got a face and a ass and a smile that won't quit


Let me see you work that, Twurk that, sur that c'mon and do the rodeo
Let me see you bounce that, move that, do that let me see you do the rodeo
Let me see you work that, Twurk that, sur that c'mon and do the rodeo
Let me see you bounce that, move that, do that let me see you do the rodeo

We not judgin' by size thats all statistics
Just turn the lights down and it's ballerific
It's not the right spot to let your daughters visit
There's some freaks up in here and it's all explicit
My round put me on just cuz he won't leave
Shit I hope he don't be trippin' on some B home shit
Cuz jack ain't worried about who Stacy's with
N he don't have to be puttin' up with Stacy's shit
I ain't lying sometime when you cross my path
up in the club all night a nigga stomp your ass
Fine I ain't trippin'
And I know you ain't trippin' cause I know you wore that the other nite for me


Let me see you work that, Twurk that, sur that c'mon and do the rodeo
Let me see you bounce that, move that, do that let me see you do the rodeo
Let me see you work that, Twurk that, sur that c'mon and do the rodeo
Let me see you bounce that, move that, do that let me see you do the rodeo
