Hey, I need it in the morning sun
I need it when the day is done
I need it 'cause it's so much fun
I need your

(Love me, love me, love me, love me, love)
(Love me, love me, love me, love me, love)
(Love me, love me, love me, love me, love)
I need your

I'm gonna get it when the lights are low
I'm gonna get it just before I go
I'll get it 'cause I love you so
I'm a little rushed to get some

(Love me, love me, love me, love me, love)
(Love me, love me, love me, love me, love)
(Love me, love me, love me, love me, love)
I need your

Now throw your arms around me
Pretend that it's a lovey-dove
Now you squeeze, ah-squeeze, squeeze, ah-oh-ah

I'm gonna get it in the morning sun
Get it when the day is done
Get it, oh
It's so much fun
I need your

Hey, I love it
Feels so good
I love it and I wish you would
I love it
Say you always will
I love your
