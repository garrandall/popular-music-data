Here I go. Im a rapper turned singer.
And you can tell that he smoke, but I don't need my vocal cords all I hit is C-Notes. 
N.E.R.D flow, I spaz if im prevoked 
I'm about to change the fuckin game, pass the re-mote. 
Money is everythang, and its every other thing. 
I'm part of the choir, its the motto that my brotha sang. 
Cash is the right now, women are the post game. 
Money-over-bitches dot com check the domain. 
It's comin too soon, album on the way. 
People ask me if I pray, I say yup, once in the blue moon. 
Oops I mean a red moon... I did it again to 'em. 
Let me leave a space in for your blood affiliation
I say, heavy metaphors, flow so over weight. 
I can rap around these other youngins like a cobra snake. 
Frost bite drizzy nigga, no body as cold as Drake. 
Keep yo ass in-line, don't be tryin to roller skate. 
Fuck all the discreet shit, I get on some deep shit. 
I am twenty-one tell me who do I compete with? 
I'm on my elite shit, you can tell I'm real cause I'm getting hood lovin I ain't even talkin' street shit. 
Young angel, young lyin and I'm done tryin. 
I'm just doin, who's drinkin cause I'm buyin. 
It's on meee, everything is on meee. 
And my girl is still down like she's fuckin John B 
And when I go dumb, I tend to do dumb shit 
I just listen back and now I'm sounding like a trumpet. 
This is for all the stripper cause I know that they gonna bump it: back it up and dump it, back it, back it up and dump it. 
Ain't no pistols here, yo money will disappear. 
My accountant will feed his family off my fiscal year. 
Text brackets and back and forth faxes 
My money comin full circle, get up on my axis. 
Maybe I'm a kill 'em, only cause I promised
They think I'm being cocky but I'm only being honest. 
I'm swallowin the goose, got a model gettin loose, and I never party unless I got some bottles in the booth. 
I just walk up on the scene, I'm about to take this, I'm just having patience cause I want it to make sense. 
White cup, orange pop, Tennessee state shit, drop a fo in it and appreciate the greatness.. DRAKE! 


Yeah, p-p-pass the dro. I am such a beast and you ask them hoes.
And they might even say you should leave me alone. 
Their only scared. Cause its just like me 
Stuntin' is a habit, get it from my daddy. 
Just like Shaggy I toat dat boom bastic 
I'm a rude bastard, I don't give a fuck bout ya'll 
I ain't talkin marbles you can pluck my balls 
And yes I'm falling but up I fall and if ya bitch in heat she can fuck my dog. 
I went from penny pension to private planes. 
Never sat on any benches, I got in games. 
Starter carter ball harder, ten girls penthouse suit ya'll order. 
Whatever ya'll please.. wine crackers and cheese. 
They take off their clothes and put on my tease. 
This this supplement im on got me feeling mighty 
My gun and money don't split call that shit Siamese. 
My watch make the frickin' time freeze. 
Yah girl bless me she suck my dick when I sneeze. 
Cheap ass apartment, just the kitchen I need. 
And eighteen G's is why the chicken cross the street. 
Whatchya know about it my niggas so about it. 
If we kill everybody they can't go to court about it. 
Weezy I ignore the liars, baby I ignite the fire, I am Michael, Michael Myers, leave your body in the dryer. 
Got the shotty on the side of me, my bad boys follow me. 
Im a bad boy obviously, pop one at your ivy league 
I dont have a rivalry if so you will have a cosualty, oops I meant a casualty, oops I meant catastrophy, oops I meant actually, 
You niggas is just ass to me, and big wet pussy is more like what I'm rathering. 
Welcome to the gathering, welcome to the burying, or I hang ya on the wall like an art gallery. 
You got short salary, and I got long money, I got cash money, I got young money.. bitch... 


See I told ya'll it'd be well worth the wait right? 


Dedication threeee. Chris FUCK wit me.
