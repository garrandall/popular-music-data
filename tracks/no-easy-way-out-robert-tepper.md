We're not indestructible
Baby, better get that straight!
I think it's unbelievable
How you give into the hands of fate!

Some things are worth fighting for
Some feelings never die
I'm not asking for another chance
I just wanna know why!


There's no easy way out!
There's no shortcut home!
There's no easy way out!
Giving in can't be wrong!

I don't wanna pacify
I don't wanna drag you down!
But I'm feeling like a prisoner
Like a stranger in a no-name town!

I see all the angry faces
Afraid that could be you and me!
Talking about what might've been
Think about how it used to be!





Baby, maybe we can shed this skin
We can know how we feel inside!
Instead of going down this endless road
Not knowing if we're DEAD OR ALIVE!

Well, some things are worth fighting for!
Some feelings never die! (NEVER DIE!)
I'm not asking for another chance!
I JUST WANNA KNOW WHY!
