Is there any boys around
That know how to make a girl feel?
That wanna make a girl feel,
Make her feel good?
All I wanna know
Is there any boys around
That know how to make a girl feel?
That wanna make a girl feel,
Make her feel good?
I just wanna know 


Do I have to tell a nigga how to touch me?
Do I have to tell a nigga how to hold me?
Do I have to tell a nigga when to call me?
Do I have to tell a nigga I'm lonely?
Do I have to feel wrong,
When it ain't strong?
Keep my mouth closed?
(Huh huh huh)
Can't a girl from tha hood find a homie,
That ain't just tryna hang around me?

Do I have to show a nigga I'm a woman?
Do I have to apologize for my emotions?
Do I have to tell a nigga what to say to me,
Everytime he wanna get next to me?
Do I have to set a full cat black case?
Stroke cuz he go
(Mmh girl no)
Can't a chick from tha hood find a homie,
That wanna do more than spend money on me?




How come I got a nigga but can't trust him?
Why every answer to my question is a question?
Why can't my nigga be my own lil somethin'?
And every girl on my block can't say they don' bumped wit?

I'm so tired of these so called wanna be hard cold pretenders that
(Have no clue)
Can't a chick from tha hood find a homie,
That I ain't gotta tell how to put it on me?
