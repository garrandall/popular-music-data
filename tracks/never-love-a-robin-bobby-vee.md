Her love was like a bird
Up in the sky
When it got cold
I watched her fly

Now tears are falling
Since she's gone away
So please believe me
When you hear me say

Never love a robin
Cause she'll fly away
Though she says she loves you
She can't stay

First sign of winter
She'll say goodbye
And while she's flying
You'll be crying
Just like me, oh

Never love a robin
She can't change her ways
And your love is numbered
By the days

When autumn leaves start falling
She'll long to fly
And you can't tame her
So don't you blame her
When she says goodbye

Never love a robin
Never love a robin

When autumn leaves start falling
She'll long to fly
And you can't tame her
So don't you blame her
When she says goodbye
