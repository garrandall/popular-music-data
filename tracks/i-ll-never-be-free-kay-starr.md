Each time I hold somebody new
My arms go cold aching for you
No one can take your place
(Darlin' in my embrace)
I'll never be free

And when my lips burn with desire
No other kiss puts out the fire
Though I may try and try
(No one can satisfy)
This longing in me

(I'll never be free from your smile so tender)
(The sweet surrender in your eyes)
How can I be free when I still remember
How you could thrill me with a sigh

Just like a chain bound to my heart
Your love remains when we're apart
Each kiss, I gave to you
(Made me a slave to you)
I'll never be free

Just like a chain bound to my heart
Your love remains when we're apart
Each kiss, I gave to you
(Made me a slave to you)
And so I'll never be free
