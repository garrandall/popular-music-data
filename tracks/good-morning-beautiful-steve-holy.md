Good morning, beautiful, how was your night?
Mine was wonderful with you by my side
And when I open my eyes to see your sweet face
It's a good morning, beautiful day

I couldn't see the light, I didn't know day from night
I had no reason to care
Well, since you've came along, I can face the dawn
'Cause I know, you'll be there

Good morning, beautiful, how was your night?
Mine was wonderful with you by my side
And when I open my eyes to see your sweet face
It's a good morning, beautiful day

I never worry if it's raining outside
'Cause in here with you, girl, the sun always shines

Good morning, beautiful, how was your night?
Mine was wonderful with you by my side
And when I open my eyes to see your sweet face
It's a good morning, beautiful day

Hmm, good morning, beautiful day
Hmm, it's a beautiful day
(Good morning beautiful, good morning beautiful)
Good morning, what a beautiful day
(Good morning beautiful, good morning beautiful)
