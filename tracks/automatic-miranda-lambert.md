Quarter in a payphone
Drying laundry on the line
Watching Sun Tea in the window
Pocket watch tellin time
Seems like only yesterday I'd get a blank cassette
Record the country countdown cause I couldn't buy it yet
If we drove all the way to Dallas just to buy an Easter dress
We'd take along a Rand McNally, stand in line to pay for gas
God knows that shifting gears ain't what it used to be
I learned to drive that 55 just like a queen, three on a tree


Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doing it all by hand
Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic


If you had something to say
You'd write it on a piece of paper
Then you'd put a stamp on it
And they'd get it three days later
Boys would call the girls
And girls would turn them down
Staying married was the only way to work your problems out


Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doing it all by hand
Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic


Automatic


Let's pull the windows down
Windows with the cranks
Come on let's take a picture
The kind you gotta shake


Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doing it all by hand
Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic
