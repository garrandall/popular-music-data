Here I come, ready or not
Here I come, ready to go
Here I come, ready or not
Here I come, ready to go

Something that you said
Goes round my head
I know I'm gonna ride tonight
You look at me
But all I want to see is you tonight

Nothing can stop me now
Nothing can stop me now
Just a question of time
I said nothing can stop me now
Nothing can stop me now
Now that I made up my mind

Here I come, ready or not
Here I come, ready to go
Here I come, ready or not
Here I come, ready to go

Girl, you got the look
As if you wrote the book
But I don't understand
How one girl can be so sure
You got me in the palm of your hand

Nothing can stop me now
Nothing can stop me now
Just a question of time
I said nothing can stop me now
Nothing can stop me now
Now that I made up my mind

Here I come, ready or not
Here I come, ready to go
Here I come, ready or not
Here I come, ready to go
Let's go

Are you ready?
(Here I come, ready or not)
Are you ready?
(Here I come, ready to go)
Ready
(Here I come, ready or not)
Said get ready
(Here I come, ready to go)

(Here I come, ready or not)
Here I come, ready or not
(Here I come, ready to go)
Here I come, ready ready
(Here I come, ready or not)
Yeah, I'm ready
(Here I come, ready to go)
To go
