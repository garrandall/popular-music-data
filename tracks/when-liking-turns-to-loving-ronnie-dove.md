I hold her hand much tighter now
Stars are shining brighter now and through out the day I find
She's always on my mind
What a wonderful, wonderful feeling
When liking turns to loving

Kiss from her, means so much more
Now I know what kissing for
The tender smiles I use to know, now I cherish so
What a wonderful, wonderful feeling
When liking turns to loving

Just a little girl, (a little girl) now she's my whole world
Music feels the starlet night, when I kiss and hold her tight
And one day just the way we plan, she'll wear my wedding band
What a wonderful, wonderful feeling
When liking turns to loving

Instrumental

And one day just the way we plan, she'll wear my wedding band
What a wonderful, wonderful feeling
When liking turns to loving
What a wonderful, wonderful feeling
