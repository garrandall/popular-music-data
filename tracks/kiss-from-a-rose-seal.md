Ba-ya-ya, ba-da-da-da-da-da, ba-ya-ya
Ba-ya-ya, ba-da-da-da-da-da, ba-ya-ya
Ba-ya-ya, ba-da-da-da-da-da, ba-ya-ya
Ba-ya-ya, ba-da-da-da-da-da, ba-ya-ya


There used to be a graying tower alone on the sea
You became the light on the dark side of me
Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill


But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and
The light that you shine can't be seen?


Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Oh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray


Ba-ya-ya, ba-da-da-da-da-da, ba-ya-ya
Ba-ya-ya, ba-da-da-da-da-da, ba-ya-ya


There is so much a man can tell you
So much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain, baby
To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny
Won't you tell me is that healthy, baby?


But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and
The light that you shine can't be seen?


Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Oh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray


I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
I, I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
I've ... (and if I should fall along the way) ... been kissed by a rose on the gray
I, I've been kissed by a rose on the gray


There is so much a man can tell you
So much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny, yeah
Won't you tell me is that healthy, baby?


But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and
The light that you shine can't be seen?


Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Oh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray
Yes, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Oh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray


Ba-ya-ya, ba-da-da-da-da-da, ba-ya-ya
Now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray
