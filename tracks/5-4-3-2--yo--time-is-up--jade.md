You gotta go on, baby, with your life
You had to get yours and now I gotta get mine
You came with me and you know I don't play
I'm sorry, it ain't going your way

5-4-3-2, your time is up
5-4-3-2, your time is up
5-4-3-2, your time is up

5-4-3-2, your time is up
5-4-3-2, your time is up

Baby give me some love and give me some respect
The way that you do the things you do when you want my askings
You know how you smile when you're guessin' me
Turnin' me on and on and on and then we gets busy

5-4-3-2, your time is up
5-4-3-2, your time is up
5-4-3-2, your time is up
5-4-3-2, your time is up

5-4-3-2, your time is up
5-4-3-2, your time is up

5, 4, 3, 2
Your time is up
Your time is up
Your time is up

You had to get yours and now I gotta get mine
No more games we're playing boy and no more lies
No no no, it ain't going your way
I got a count down for you, send you on your way

5-4-3-2, your time is up
5-4-3-2, your time is up
5-4-3-2, your time is up
