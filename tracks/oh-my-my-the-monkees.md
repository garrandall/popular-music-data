By Jeff Barry and Andy Kim

Oh my my, I could love you forever
Oh my my, I only wish that I could
Oh my my, I could love you forever
Oh my my, girl you feel so good

You, you make my heart sing
You make my life worthwhile
I feel such there's so much to discover
To uncover it is gonna take a while

Oh my my, I could love you forever
Oh my my, I only wish that I could
Oh my my, I could love you forever
Oh my my, girl you feel so good

I think of us together
It takes my breath away
Up to the sky I go flying
"Oh my my" is all I can say

Break

Oh my my
Oh my my my my
Oh my my my my my my
Oh my oh my (oh my oh my oh my my my my my my)

You, you make my heart sing
You make my life worthwhile
I feel such there's so much to discover
To uncover it is gonna take a while

Oh my my, I could love you forever
Oh my my, I only wish that I could
Oh my my, I could love you forever

Oh my my, I could love you forever
Oh my my, I only wish that I could
Oh my my, I could love you forever
Oh my girl you feel so good
