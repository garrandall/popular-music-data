I've been lonely
I've  been blue
But  I've never met a girl like you
My heart's been broken
Many times before
But  it won't be broken any more

Well  you're you're the one
Who changed my whole life through
Well  my walk, my talk would be different
And all just because of you

And I won't be lonely
And I won't be blue
Cause  I fell in love with a girl like you
Whoa whoa
A girl like you
A girl a girl a girl like you
