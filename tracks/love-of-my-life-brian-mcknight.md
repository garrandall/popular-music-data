First,first time I look into your eyes
I saw heaven-oh-heaven in your eyes
Everything I did before you
Wasn't worth my time
It should've been you
You all the time
I do anything and everything
To please you
You know how much I need you
You're always always on my mind


You're more than wonderful
More than amazing
The irreplaceable love of my life
You're so incredible
Here in these arms of mine
The irreplaceable love of my life

Always seem like a reality
Forever don't seem so far away
All I want to do
All I want to feel
All I want be is close to you (close to you)
Everyday is my lucky day
All I want to do is love you
I place no one above you
I tell you why


You're more than wonderful
More than amazing
The irreplaceable love, love of my life
You're so incredible
Here in these arms of mine
The irreplaceable love of my life

Baby you know
You know you're my one and only
All I want to do is be together
Shawty you know I'll never leave you lonely
In your eyes, In your eyes I see forever

Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Ohhhhhhhhhh oh oh
Ohhhhhhhh Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh oh oh


You're more than wonderful
More than amazing
The irreplaceable love of my life
You're so incredible
Here in these arms tonight
The irreplaceable love of my life
