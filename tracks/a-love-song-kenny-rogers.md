Why do people cry
When they hear the word goodbye
In a love song?
Tears are sure to fall
When you know they gave it all
In a love song
Somehow two lovers get a chance
At a beautiful romance
And you wish it could be you

'Cause everybody's needing
What the singers all are singing
In a love song

It can tear you apart
'Cause a word can break a heart
In a love song
They say all the things you feel
And they make it sound so real
In a love song
It seems that everything they say
Is said in such a way
That we believe it's true

'Cause everybody's needing
What the singers all are singing
In a love song

Each of us know
There's no guarantee
We'll ever find love
And in the songs that we share
The heartache is there
To remind us
New love brings a thrill
And we know it always will
In a love song

Happiness can leave
But it helps if we believe
In a love song
There's a part of you and me
In every memory
That tells us who we are

And everybody's needing
