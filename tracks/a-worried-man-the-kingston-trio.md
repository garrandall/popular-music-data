It takes a worried man
To sing a worried song
It takes a worried man
To sing a worried song
It takes a worried man
To sing a worried song
I'm worried now
But I won't be worried long

Got myself a Cadillac
Thirty dollars down
Got myself a brand new house
Five miles out of town
Got myself a gal named Sue
Treats me really fine
Yes, she's my baby
And I love her all the time

It takes a worried, worried man
To sing a worried, worried song
It takes a worried, worried man
To sing a worried, worried song
It takes a worried man
To sing a worried song
I'm worried now
But I won't be worried long

I've been away on a business trip
Travelin' all around
I've got a gal and her name is Sue
Prettiest gal in town
She sets my mind to worryin'
Every time I'm gone
I'll be home tonight
So I won't be worried long!

It takes a worried man
To sing a worried song
It takes a worried man
To sing a worried song
It takes a worried man
To sing a worried song
I'm worried now
But I won't be worried long.

Well, Bobby's in the living room
Holding hands with Sue
Nickie's at that big front door
'Bout to come on through
Well, I'm here in the closet
Oh, Lord, what shall I do?
We're worried now
But we won't be worried long

It takes a worried man
To sing a worried song (oh yes)
It takes a worried man
To sing a worried song
It takes a worried man
To sing a worried song

I'm worried now
But I won't be worried long
