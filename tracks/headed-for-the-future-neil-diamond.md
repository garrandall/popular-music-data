Hey,
We're headed for the future
Give us some room
We're gonna build a new world

Say,
We're headed for the future
Give us some time
We're gonna make it work right

Yeah,
We're gonna build a new dream
We've got to make it stand tall
It's got to last a long time

Lean on me
And I'm gonna lean on you
We're headed for the future
And the future's now
Show you how

Hey,
We're headed for a new place
A step at a time
We're gonna take a long ride

Time
Don't wait around forever
We've got to do it right now
Let's do it all together

Lean on me
And I'm gonna lean on you
We're headed for the future
And the future's now
Show you how

Lean on me
'Cause I'm gonna lean on you
We're headed for the future

Come on,
Lean on me
And I'm gonna lean on you
We're headed for the future
And the future's ours

Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Yeah
