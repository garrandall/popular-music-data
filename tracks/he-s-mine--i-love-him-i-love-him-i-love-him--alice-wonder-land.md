I know he doesn't
Have much dough
But he will someday
Somehow

He starts his hard work
After school
Let me tell you
He's nobody's fool

And he's mine
(I love him, I love him)
(I love him) oh, he's mine
(I love him, I love him)
(I love him) yeah, he's mine
(I love him, I love him)
(I love him) he's so fine
And he's mine, all mine

He doesn't leave any doubt
He goes his own way
And he's stout
He's right to hold
His head up high
I tell you he's
The greatest guy

And he's mine
(I love him, I love him)
(I love him) oh, he's mine
(I love him, I love him)
(I love him) yeah, he's mine
(I love him, I love him)
(I love him) he's so fine
And he's mine, all mine

And he's mine
(I love him, I love him)
(I love him) oh, he's mine
(I love him, I love him)
(I love him) yeah, he's mine
(I love him, I love him)
(I love him) he's so fine
And he's mine, all mine

And he's mine
(I love him, I love him)
(I love him) oh, he's mine
(I love him, I love him)
(I love him) yeah, he's mine
(I love him, I love him)
(I love him) he's so fine
And he's mine, all mine

And he's mine
(I love him, I love him)
(I love him) oh, he's mine
(I love him, I love him)
(I love him) yeah, he's mine
(I love him, I love him)
(I love him) he's so fine
And he's mine, all mine
