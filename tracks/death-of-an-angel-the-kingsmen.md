My baby's gone
And she left me to stay

My baby's gone and left me
My baby's gone away
My baby's gone
And she left me to stay o-o-oh
I know my baby's left
O-o-o-o-o-oh

I still remember the day
The day she went away
That was the day-y-y
That she left me to stay-y-y-y

I know my baby's gone
O-o-o-o-o-o-oh
O-o-o-o-o-o-oh

That was the death of an angel now
I don't know why
I want to be beside her but
I'm afraid to die

My baby's gone
My baby's gone away
My baby's gone
Here she left me to stay o-o-oh
Baby please come back home
O-o-o-o-o-o-oh
Dear, won't you please come home
Woe woe woe

My baby's gone
My baby's gone away
