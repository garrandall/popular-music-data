Yeah
Fuck your love, fuck it, I don't want none of it (Yeah)
Fuck your trust, fuck it, I don't want none of it, no (Yeah)
Fuck you, fuck you, I don't need your love, love, yeah
Yeah, but who needs love (love), that ain't never changed, shit (Yeah)
Still the same, I never changed bitch
I been rolling 'round with the same clique
I been rolling 'round with the gang bitch
Fuck your squad and who you came with
In a foreign car, switching lanes quick
And I'm destined for this fucking greatness, ayy

And I don't got time for a bitch that's gonna slow a nigga like me down (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I keep on speed racing to the motherfucking cash
Nigga, I'm a fucking cash cow (Ahh)
Stuntin' like my motherfucking daddy bitch (Yeah)
Spend a hundred on a ring and a Patek wrist (Yeah)
And the chopper on my hip is automatic bitch (Automatic)
Get the brrrr-rah, get to blasting shit (Bow!)

Don't fuck with me, don't say that (Don't say that)
That bullshit, shorty save that (Save that)
I knew shorty since way back, way back when
I was eatin' it up, beatin' it up, ayy
Eatin' it up, beatin' it up, ayy
Feastin' it up, feastin' it up, ayy
Livin' it up, livin' it up, ayy
We did it yeah, we did it yeah, ayy
Still the same, no
Still the same, hoe

Yeah
Fuck your love, fuck it, I don't want none of it (Yeah)
Fuck your trust, fuck it, I don't want none of it, no (Yeah)
Fuck you, fuck you, I don't need your love, love, yeah
Yeah, but who needs love (love), that ain't never changed, shit (Yeah)
Still the same, I never changed bitch
I been rolling 'round with the same clique
I been rolling 'round with the gang bitch
Fuck your squad and who you came with
In a foreign car, switching lanes quick
And I'm destined for this fucking greatness, ayy
