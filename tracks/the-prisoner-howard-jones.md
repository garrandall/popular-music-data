You have watched me, safe in your anonymity
I have dreamed you, held in your security
Some people believe a photograph traps your mortal soul
Your eyes were the camera and you've take hold
And you captured me
I need you to take control
I am a prisoner of no confidence
You've entered me now make me whole

Every place I go I feel your lenses trained on me
This distant concentration takes away my energy
Your image burns it's negative
Behind my waking eyes
Then the night comes and you stalk your prize
And you captured me
I need you to take control
I am a prisoner of no confidence
You've entered me now make me whole

Some people believe a photograph traps your mortal soul
Your eyes were the camera and you've taken hold
And you captured me
I need you to take control
I am a prisoner of no confidence
You've entered me now make me whole
