What was I before you
Just another guy who never knew
The right time from the wrong
His left foot from his right
Who'd sleep all day and hang around all night
Before you

Who was I
Just the joker in the crowd
If I make them laugh how proud I would be
Though the jokes were on me

Now it's you and me
You and me
And the worlds a better place

Thank you, baby
Thank you, baby
Thank you, baby
Thank you, baby

What a change love can bring
Put a different light on everything
An ordinary day
Is filled with something new
And suddenly I feel that I can do
Anything

You, my love
Are the meaning of my life
You're the reason
And the light of my life
I'm so grateful you're mine

Now it's you and me
You and me
And the worlds a better place

Thank you, baby
Thank you, baby
Thank you, baby
Thank you, baby

You and me
You and me
