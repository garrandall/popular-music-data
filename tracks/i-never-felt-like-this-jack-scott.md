Well, bless my soul 'cause it's a-happened to me
The girl with the big blue eyes
One little kiss was a-heaven a-bliss
And I never felt like this
Well, my face got red and then I started to sweat
And there were chills up and down my spine
And then the one little kiss was a-heaven a-bliss
And I never felt like this
Stood there petrified and I got electrified
When she pressed her lips to mine
So I packed my clothes and I hit the trail
And a good golly baby she's a-right on my tail
I don't give a worry and I don't feel sorry
'Cause I never knew what I missed
And then the one little kiss was a-heaven a-bliss
And I never felt like this
It was a solid night, the moon was big and bright
Just like I wanted it to be
Then she took me in her arms, sat me on her knee
And I knew little baby was a-meant for me
Oh, I don't give a worry and I don't feel sorry
'Cause I never knew what I missed
And then the one little kiss was a-heaven a-bliss
And I never felt like this
'Cause he never felt like this
'Cause he never felt like this
'Cause I never felt like this
