Now ya got the Krazy, Krazy with da Books
Yes yes y'all, yes y'all, yes y'all, yes y'all
Now ya got the Krazy, Krazy with da Books
Yes yes y'all, yes y'all, yes y'all, yes y'all
Now ya got the Krazy, Krazy with da Books
Yes yes y'all, yes y'all, yes y'all, yes y'all
Now ya got the Krazy, Krazy with da Books
(Now I'm off and runnin on some new rhyme flow)

Well comin to school ya it's the hooligan
I'm in the mood again so watch me do this
I'm out to do these rappers just like Popeye did Brutus
The super dooper, trooper, oops I'm no beginner
So watch me get loose and run shit like Bruce Jenner
I formulate my raps, perhaps you wanna kick it
These niggas know my status, I'm the baddest when I wreck it
See I'm nicer than the rest, I guess I gots ta prove it
Ya cruisin for a bruisin if ya bite it when I use it
See I'm quick to shoot the gift, and if ya tryin ta stop it
I got mad skills like loose change in my pocket
I drop it from the East, at least I'm gettin mine in
Some niggas gettin jealous cause of the way that I be rhymin

Oh, hello there, how the hell are ya? Sorry to keep you waitin
It's like nuttin when I'm flowin, somethin rougher than menstruation
Cramps, I'm followed by your camp like John Cougar
Mellen, tell them punks I put a swell in, where the Lord split ya
I kick tails that tip scales on the Richter
I dip-dip-dive with more drive than the Harlem River
Oh what the hell, I'll smoke a half a el then stub it
Pick up my grip then spark the clip and get rugged, see
It's back to basics if you're wack then niggas hate it
Got the knack to freak a track like I was sprintin in some Asics
Boy, I'm slicker than soap-on-a-rope
I'm madder than the Mad Hatter and Yabber Dabber Dope and you can quote...

Now ya got the Krazy, Krazy with da Books
Yes yes y'all, yes y'all, yes y'all, yes y'all
Now ya got the Krazy, Krazy with da Books
Yes yes y'all, yes y'all, yes y'all, yes y'all
Now ya got the Krazy, Krazy with da Books
Yes yes y'all, yes y'all, yes y'all, yes y'all
Now ya got the Krazy, Krazy with da Books
(Now I'm off and runnin on some new rhyme flow)

Well once again it's the spectacular
Attackin ya, back in ya, fuckin face it
Terrorizing MCs as if my name was Jason
I crash em, trash em, monster mash em til they seckle
I'm quick to switch up and kick ass like Dr. Jekyll
I'll bring it from the guts, my DJ got the cuts
Shit that I be bringin got'cha swingin on my nuts
I'm not the typical lyrical, gotta be a miracle
Drop the type of shit that make ya flip and get hysterical
I'm nasty with the verbs, kid, I'll serve ya, rip ya, bust it
My raps they never collapse cause on the tracks, see I be bustin like
Fireworks, I'll fly your jerk skull and then I'll step
I'm back from hibernation and I'm waitin to give it a rest

Give it a rest fool, great balls of fire, boy I'm flyer than a cockpit
Hops, I rock shit and knock niggas out the box with
Uncontrollable lyrical motions from my larynx
So, slick, watch your chick because my clique might slam her next
Like BOOYAA, ready or not, troop, don't mean to lose ya
Kickin a style for '96, thinking back to the future
Puff some buddha for the brain and drain a 40 for the belly
I'm aimin for the top just like this was a game of skully
Plus I'm sinkin ships, doin whatever makes the blow rock
My crew is good for nothin, stuffin chicks without the Stove Top
When I groove up, put your dukes up, or catch a oops-up
Side your sleazy rep cause this the peeps beneath the steps, boy

Now ya got the Krazy, Krazy with da Books
Yes yes y'all, yes y'all, yes y'all, yes y'all
Now ya got the Krazy, Krazy with da Books
Yes yes y'all, yes y'all, yes y'all, yes y'all
Now ya got the Krazy, Krazy with da Books
Yes yes y'all, yes y'all, yes y'all, yes y'all
Now ya got the Krazy, Krazy with da Books
(Now I'm off and runnin on some new rhyme flow)
