I'll give you anything A like that y'all, a like that ya like
I'll give you anything baby A like that y'all, a like that like that
I'll give you anything A like that y'all, a like that ya like
A like that y'all, a like that like that
I'll give you anything A like that y'all, a like that check it out
I'll give you anything baby A like that y'all, a check it out check it out



Anticipation, of what's to come
I'm so happy that, I'm the lucky one
So long I've waited but it's, never too late
For love...

It feels so right, baby, that it can't be wrong
Where I am weak, baby, you make me strong
I'm down for you, and whatever you want
to do... it's all up to you, because



Anything you want, baby Gonna try to
I am gonna try to do It's alright
I'm gonna try, to do
Pleasure every way You can ride
Just to get with you If you want to
To...



Whatever method used, is alright with me
As long as you get to where, you need to be
This is the vision made for both of our eyes

To see...

It feels so right, it can't be wrong
Where I am weak, ba-by, you make me strong
I'm down for you, and whatever you want me
To do... it's all up to you, because




Dirty Bas, style cuts like glass
Gotta gotta keep it high power to the mass
Yo Gods, another like platinum hit
Party people all around be sayin that's the shit!


Kaboom! Guess who stepped in the room
Tical, hailing from the Shaolin Isle
It be me the killer bee, on the M-I-C
With the S-S-double-double-U (W) to the V-V
Me me goin downtown, let me see
If we all and together now, make it mo' better now
Listen, I ain't sweatin no competition
Flow, goin mad low like I'm dissin


Another chapter from the Wu-Tang group
Take a look or a peak, killer bees never sleep
Nonstop, put you on the choppin block
Unorthodox, attitude to melting pot


I'll do anything, I'm so into you
Right here, I win, downtown with the Wu
Kaboom! Guess who stepped in the room
The S-S-double-double-U (W) to the V-V
