And I am reaching out for your love
Won't you touch me baby
Touch me, baby

I... reaching out for your love
Please touch me baby
Touch me baby

All my life
I've starved for love
But behind my mask of pride
Lord I hide it from the one I truly loved
Afraid to let go
I just suffered from within

And just when I was in need
Of a real true friend
Oh, I looked around
Oh, and you we're gone
Suddenly I felt all alone
(All alone)

And now I finally found
Reaching out for your love
Won't you touch me baby
(Touch me baby)

I... reaching out for your love
Please touch me baby, baby
(Touch me baby)

All my life
I play this game for fun
But now when I need
A sharin' with someone
I'm reaching out to you
Removing my mask of pride

Awww, and as I'm knealing
Right here by your side
I'm begging you to stay
'Cause I can't make it on my own

So please don't deny me
Because I
Reaching out for your love
Won't you touch me baby, baby
(Touch me baby)

And I am reaching out for your love
Please touch me baby, baby
(Touch me baby)
I... reaching out for your love
