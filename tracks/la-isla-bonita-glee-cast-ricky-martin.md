David:
¿Cómo puede ser verdad?
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

David and Santana:
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature, wild and free
This is where I long to be
La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Santana:
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

David and Santana:
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature, wild and free
This is where I long to be
La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Santana:
Yo quiero estar donde el sol toca cielo
Cuando es hora de siesta tú los puedes ver pasar

David and Santana:
Caras tan bellas, sin importar nada
Where a girl loves a boy
And a boy

David (Santana):
Loves a girl (Oooo)
The Spanish lullaby (Hey!)
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro (San Pedro)

David and Santana:
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature, wild and free
This is where I long to be
La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

David with Santana (Santana):
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature, wild and free
This is where I long to be
La Isla Bonita (Taa-aa)

David:
And when the samba played

David and Santana (Santana):
The sun would set so high
Ring trough my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby (Spanish lullaby)
A na na na na na na na (Te dijo te amo)

David:
Oooo

David and Santana:
Yeah...

Santana:
La la la la la la

David:
Él dijo que te ama
Ay-yeah, yeah! (Santana: Oooo, yeah!)

David:
La Isla Bonita
La Isla Bonita

David and Santana:
Bonita, bonita
Your Spanish lullaby
