Every year when
Spring rolls around
My lonely heart
Falls to the ground

I'm glad I found
A little girl like you
I've got spring fever
In love with you

You got the charm
To really make me flip
I looked at you
And the lovebug bit

I'm glad I found
A little girl like you
I've got spring fever
In love with you

We'll have a ball
When school is through
I got a million things
That we can do

At the beach
We'll have a real good time
I'll show you off cause you're
Mine, mine, mine, mine

I hope and pray that
When the summer's gone
Our time together
Will go on and on

We'll do the little
Things we usually do
We'll have spring fever
The whole year through

Spring fever, in love with you
Dooby dooby dooby do do do
Spring fever, in love with you
Dooby dooby dooby do do do
Spring fever, in love with you
Dooby dooby dooby do do do
Spring fever, in love with you
Dooby dooby dooby do do do

We'll have a ball
When school is through
I got a million things
That we can do

At the beach
We'll have a real good time
I'll show you off cause you're
Mine, mine, mine, mine

I hope and pray that
When the summer's gone
Our time together
Will go on and on

We'll do the little
Things we usually do
We'll have spring fever
The whole year through

And we'll have spring fever
The whole year through
And we'll have spring fever
The whole year through
