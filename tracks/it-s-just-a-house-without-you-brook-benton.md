Cause you see
I'm going home to no one
I'm going home alone

It was fun to be fancy free
But now my loneliness
Shows through, I miss you

What's the good in crying
I'm only wasting tears
What can I say, what can I do
It's just a house without you

We planned a home
High on a hill
Til I had the urge to roam
But now I found
No peace of mind
I can't seem to live alone

I think I'm gonna stop this crying
Yeah, I'm only wasting tears
What can I say, what can I do
It's a house without you
Just a house without you

Now we planned a home
High up on a hill
Til I had the urge to roam
But now I found
No peace of mind
I can't seem to live alone

Lord, I got to stop this crying
Cause I'm only wasting tears
Why should I fret
And go and grab a jet
Cause what am I rushing to

It's just a hole in
The wall without you
It ain't nothing there without you
It's like zero without you
Baby, ain't nothing there without you
