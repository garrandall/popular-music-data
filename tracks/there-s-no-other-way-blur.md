You're taking the fun out of everything
You're making me run when I don't want to think
You're taking the fun out of everything
I don't want to think at all


There's no other way, there's no other way
All that you can do is watch them play


You're taking the fun out of everything
You're making it clear when I don't want to think
You're taking me up when I don't want to go up anymore
I'm just watching it all


There's no other way, there's no other way
All that you can do is watch them play
There's no other way, there's no other way
All that you can do is watch them play


I'll watch you play
I'll watch you play


There's no other way, there's no other way
All that you can do is watch them play
There's no other way, there's no other way
All that you can do is watch them play
There's no other way, there's no other way
All that you can do is watch them play
There's no other way, there's no other way
All that you can do is watch them play
