I was in Austin when you called me
I noticed your voice it sounded strange
Everything is fine that's what you told me
But I can tell that some things changed

Chorus
It's been a long time loving you
Long time learnin' to
Know exactly how you feel inside
I knew yesterday what your gonna say tomorrow
Let me say it for you, goodbye

Everything was fine as I was leaving
Now them old road un-took it's toll
I can't blame you for not believing
In a man you only see your unfold

Chorus (x2)
Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye...
