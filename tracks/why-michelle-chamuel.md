How many times do I have to try to tell you
That I'm sorry for the things I've done
But when I start to try to tell you
That's when you have to tell me
Hey, this kind of trouble's only just begun

I tell myself too many times
Why don't you ever learn to keep your big mouth shut
That's why it hurts so bad to hear the words
That keep on falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth

Tell me,
Why

Let's go down to the water's edge
And we can cast away those doubts
Some things are better left unsaid
But they still turn me inside out
Turning inside out turning inside out

Tell me,
Why

This is the book I never read
These are the words I never said
This is the path I'll never tread
These are the dreams I'll dream instead
This is the joy that's seldom spread

These are the tears, the tears we shed
This is the fear, this is the dread
These are the contents of my head
These are the years that we have spent
And this is what they represent

And this is how I feel
Do you know how I feel?
Oh oh, I don't think you know
I don't think you know what I feel
No, I don't think you know, what I feel
