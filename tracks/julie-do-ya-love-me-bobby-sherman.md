Bein' alone at night makes me sad, girl
Yeah, it brings me down all right
Tossin' and turnin' and freezin' and burnin'
And cryin' all through the night
Whoa-oh
Julie, Julie, Julie, do ya love me?
Julie, Julie, Julie, do ya care?
Julie, Julie, are ya thinkin' of me?
Julie, Julie, will ya still be there?
We had so much fun together
I was sure that you were mine
But leavin' you, baby, is drivin' me crazy
It's got me wonderin' all the time
Whoa-oh
Julie, Julie, Julie, do ya love me?
Ah, Julie, Julie, Julie, do ya care?
Julie, Julie, are ya thinkin' of me?
Julie, Julie, will ya still be there?
Honey, you cried the day I left you
Even though we knew I couldn't stay
But baby, remember, I'll be back September
But till then I'll write you every day
Whoa-oh
Julie, Julie, Julie, do ya love me?
Ah, Julie, Julie, Julie, do ya care?
Come on, Julie, Julie, are ya thinkin' of me?
Julie, Julie, will ya still be there?
Oh-oh
Julie, Julie, Julie, do ya love me?
Ah, Julie, Julie, Julie, do ya care?
Julie, Julie, are ya thinkin' of me?
Julie, Julie, will ya still be there?
