Barbwire fence carving out a hillside, cutting holes in the midday sun, like a postcard framed in a windshield covered in dust.
I love the rythmn of an old gray black top, 33's just whistling bye, steer the wheel one handed on a two lane hugging that line.
I got the windows down, No one else around
Singing ohhhh
Freedom is the miles I'm rolling on

Ohhhhhh
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody, like a radio dialing in strong, come on come on, sing along sing along to my backroad song.
Oooohhhhh oooohhhhh
I hit the brakes for an old New Holland, hammered down and passed him on up, The breeze smeels like a summertime hay field thats just been cut.
I got the windows down way out of town
Singing ooohhhh
Freedom is the miles im rolling on

Ohhhhhh
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody, like a radio dialing in strong, come on come on, sing along sing along to my backroad song.

Ooooohhhh ooooohhh
The only way today could get better, girl what im thinking, is I can pick you up you slide in this truck and I can hear you singin'
Oooohhhhh
Let me hear you singin'
Oooohhhh
Oooohhhh
Freedom is the miles im rolling on
Oooohhhhhh

Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody, like a radio dialing in strong, come on come on, sing along sing along to my backroad song.
Come on come on, sing along sing along to my backroad song.

This is my backroad song
(Feel the rythmn of it)
This is my backroad song
(Feel the rythmn of it)
Come on come on sing along
(Feel the rythmn of it)
To my backroad song
(Feel the rythmn of it)
