Bring over some of your old Motown records
We'll put the speakers in the window and we'll go
on the roof and listen to the Miracles
echo to the alley down below

Let's dance together just for the night
Let's don't worry about the future or nothin' else
'Cause just like the music's sayin' you gotta take chances
Go ahead just do it and trust yourself

There's a soul in the city
watching over us tonight
There's a soul in the city
saying everything's gonna be all right

So bring over some of your old Motown records
We'll put the speakers in the window and we'll go
on the roof and listen to the Miracles
echo to the alley down below

They wish us luck
but they think we're just dreaming
Let's prove them wrong baby
'Cause you know what luck is
luck is believing you're lucky
that's all and showing just a little bit of faith

There's a soul in the city
watching over us I swear
There's a soul in the city
there's a whole world waiting out there

Listen
I got plans for us
playing like a skip on a record
through my head all night long
But when we walk that darkened stairway
and step out on the roof
I know what we're feeling can't be wrong

Bring over some of your old Motown records
We'll put the speakers in the window and we'll go
on the roof and listen to the Miracles
echo to the alley down below

Bring over some of your old Motown records
We'll put the speakers in the window and we'll go
on the roof and listen to the Miracles
echo to the alley down below
"Let the Temptations sing it one time"
Bring over some of you old Motown records
We'll put the speakers in the window and we'll go
on the roof and listen to the Miracles
echo to the alley down below
