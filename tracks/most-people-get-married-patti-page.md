When the kisses get so long that you can't catch your breath
And the huggin' gets so strong that it's gotcha scared to death
Most people get married (married)
That's what they do-o-o
Most people get married (married)
And that's what I wanna do with you

When you only wanna walk (let's walk) together
Only wanna talk (let's talk) together
Only wanna touch (let's touch) too much
You never wanna say "Good night"

Most people get married (married)
That's what they do-o-o
I-I-I wanna get married (married)
An' I only wanna do it to you

When you light up like a flame each time your baby calls

And the way he says your name has gotcha climbin' walls
Most people get married (married)
That's what they do-o-o
Most people get married (married)
And that's what I wanna do with you

When you're feelin' in your heart (doo-wop), what I feel
Reelin' in your heart (doo-wop) like I reel
An' you wanna shout (you shout) "Look out,
Somethin's gotta give tonight"

Most people get married (married)
That's what they do-o-o
I-I-I wanna get married (married)
An' I only wanna do it to you

I-I-I wanna get married
An' I hope you wanna do it, too
