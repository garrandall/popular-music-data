Ain't no guy in town
Who would ever try to put me down
When I'm walkin' walkin' with my angel, whoa-uh-oh

'Cause every guy I see
Is a-wishin' that-a he were me
When I'm walkin' walkin' with my angel (angel)

A-when we're strollin' hand in hand
I'm as happy as can be
Aww, she's the prettiest girl in town
And everyone can see she belongs to me

Well I feel so proud
It's as good as walkin' on a cloud
When I'm walkin' walkin' with my angel

Aww, when we're strollin' hand in hand
I'm as happy as can be
'Cause she's the prettiest girl in town
And everyone can see she belongs to me

Well I feel so proud
It's as good as walkin' on a cloud
When I'm walkin' walkin' with my angel

Aww, when I'm walkin' walkin' with my angel
Yeah, when I'm walkin' walkin' with my angel
