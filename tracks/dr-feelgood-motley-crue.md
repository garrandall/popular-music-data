Rat-tailed Jimmy is a second hand hood
Deals down in Hollywood
Got a '65 Chevy, with primered flames
Traded for some powdered goods
Jigsaw Jimmy, he's a runnin' a gang
But, I hear he's doin' o.k.
Got a cozy little job
Sells the Mexican mob
Packages of candy cane

He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He's the one that makes you feel all right
He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood

Cops on the corner always ignore
Somebody's gettin' paid
Jimmy's got it wired
Law's for hire
Got it made in the shade
Got a little hideaway, does business all day
But at night he'll always be found
Sellin' sugar to the sweet
People on the street
Call this Jimmy's town

He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He's the one that makes you feel all right
He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He's gonna be your Frankestein!

I got one thing you'll understand
He's not what you'd call a glamorous man
Got one thing that's easily understood
He's the only one they call Dr. Feelgood
Oh, yeah

He'll tell you he's the king of these barrio streets
Movin' up from Shangra-La
Came by his wealth as a matter of luck
Says he never broke no law
Two-time loser runnin' out of juice
Time to move out quick
Heard a rumor goin' round
Jimmy's goin' down
This time it's gonna stick

He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He's the one that makes you feel all right
He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He's gonna be your Frankestein!

Let him soothe your soul, just take his hand
Some people call him and evil man
Let him introduce himself real good
He's the only one they call Dr. Feelgood

I've got one thing you'll understand
He's not what you'd call a glamorous man
Got one thing that's easily understood
He's the only one they call Dr. Feelgood
