Oh yeah, yeah
Oh
Yeah, babe
Oh I remember
And I wanna know

Where were you, when I said I loved you
And where were you when I cried at night
Waiting up, couldn't sleep without you
Thinking of all the times we shared

I remember when my heart broke
I remember when I gave up lovin' you
My heart couldn't take no more of you
I was sad and lonely
I remember when I walked out
I remember when I screamed I hated you
But some how deep inside I deep inside still lovin' you
Sad and lonely

No one knew all the pain I went through
All the love, I saved deep in my heart for you
Didn't know, where I would go, where I would be
But you made me leave
And plus my heart it just, it just kept telling me so oh

Oh I remember when my heart broke
I remember when I gave up loving you
My heart couldn't take no more of you
I was sad and lonely

I remember when I walked out
I remember when I said I hated you
But some how deep inside still loving you
So sad and lonely

There was nowhere else to go, oh
No body else to turn to no
For the rest of my life
I promise myself I, will love me first
Then you and me

I remember when my heart broke
I remember when I gave up loving you
My heart couldn't take no more of you
I was sad and lonely

I remember when I walked out
I remember when I said I hated you
But some how deep inside still loving you
Sad and lonely

I remember when I walked out
I remember when I gave up loving you
My heart couldn't take no more of you
So sad and lonely, hey!

I remember when I stormed out
I remember when I gave, up loving you
I was sad and lonely
