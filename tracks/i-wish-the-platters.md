I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish for you
I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish for you

I wish you were always with a smile
I wish you were happy all the while
I wish you were never in despair
And life could be a sweet affair
I wish that my love could bring to you
Happiness and joy to cling to you

All the things that gives a lover's wings
Are all the things I wish for

I wish somehow we could always be
Finding sunshine hiding misery
I wish someday we would never part
And love would start from heart to heart
All these happy things I wish for you
All the wondrous things and dreams we knew
Living, loving things that lovers do
They do come true, my wishes
