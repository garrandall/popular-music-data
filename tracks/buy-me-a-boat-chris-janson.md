I ain't rich, but I damn sure wanna be
Working like a dog all day ain't working for me
I wish I had a rich uncle that'd kick the bucket
And I was sitting on a pile like Warren Buffett
I know everybody says
Money can't buy happiness

But it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced-down with some silver bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say,
Money can't buy everything
Well, maybe so,
But it could buy me a boat

They call me redneck, white trash and blue collar
But I could change all that if I had a couple million dollars
I keep hearing that money is the root of all evil
And you can't fit a camel through the eye of a needle
I'm sure that's probably true,
But it still sounds pretty cool

'Cause it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced-down with some silver bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say,
Money can't buy everything
Well, maybe so,
But it could buy me a boat

To float down on the water with a beerâ¦
I hear the Powerball Lotto is a-sitting on a hundred millâ¦
Well, that would buy me a brand new rod and reelâ¦

And it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced-down with some silver bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say,
Money can't buy everything
Well, maybe so,
But it could buy me a boat

Yeah, and I know what they say,
Money can't buy everything
Well, maybe so,
But it could buy me a boat
It could buy me a boat.
