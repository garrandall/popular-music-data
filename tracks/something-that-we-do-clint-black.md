I remember well the day we wed
I can see that picture in my head
I still believe the words we said
Forever will ring true
Love is certain, love is kind
Love is yours and love is mine
But it isn't somethin' that we find
It's somethin' that we do


It's holding tight, It's lettin' go
It's flyin' high and layin' low
It lets your strongest feelin's show
And your weakness too
It's a little and a lot to ask
An endless and a welcome task
Love isn't somethin' that we have
It's somethin' that we do


We help to make each other all that we can be
Though we can find our strength and inspiration, independently
The way we work together is what sets our love apart
So closely that we can't tell where I end and where you start


It gives me heart remembering how
We started with a simple vow
There's so much to look back on now
Still it feels brand new
We're on a road that has no end
And each day we begin again
Love's not just somethin' that we're in
It's somethin' that we do


We help to make each other all that we can be
We can find our strength and inspiration, independently
The way we work together is what sets our love apart
So closely that we can't tell where I end and where you start


Love is wide, love is long
Love is deep and love is strong
Love is why I love this song
And I hope you love it too
I remember well the day we wed
I can see that picture in my head
Love isn't just those words we said
It's somethin' that we do


There's no request, too big or small
We give ourselves, we give our all
Love isn't some place that we fall
It's somethin' that we do
