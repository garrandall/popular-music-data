HaHa!
You all need to get ready to hear
The unbelievable,
Indescribable
Vanessa Hudgens.
Baby V!

(Baby Come Back)

Everyday, I try to play, another game
But my heart canât take it.
I try to find, another boy,
But all the while, I canât face it.
Why do I miss you so much?
I wanna stop this hurt inside
Oh baby please, give us one more try

(Baby Come Back)

I see you out with all your friends
Laughinâ it up as you pretend
To have a good time, (good time)
I know cause I'm living the same lie (same lie)
So one of us has got to say
We can't keep living this same way
So Iâll be the one
Yeah Iâll say it, Iâll say it, Iâll say it, Iâll say it again

Baby Come back to me
In my heart I still believe
We were meant to beâ¦
Together so whatever it takes (Baby Come Back)
Baby come back to me
I should have never set you free
My baby
Come back (Baby Come Back)

I wanna call, but then I stall,
Cause after all, I just couldnât take it
Cause if your play was to push me away
You know that day, my heart youâd break it (Baby Come Back)
I know we made a mistake, (I do)
Canât you stop your foolish pride (Oh no)
And come back to me
Letâs try, Letâs try, Letâs try, Letâs try it again

Baby Come back to me (Come Back)
In my heart I still believe
We were meant to beâ¦
Together so whatever it takes (Baby Come Back)
Baby come back to me
I should have never set you free
My baby
Come back (Baby Come Back)


You know you miss your baby V
And I can see that you think about me
So why do you act like you donât care
Like all this love between us isnât there
I know that you're upset
I know I did you wrong
I know that you want me to pay for all the pain Iâve caused
But in the end it all comes down to just one thing,
Itâs you and me
So I sing

Baby Come Back!

Baby Come back to me
In my heart I still believe
We were meant to beâ¦
Together so whatever it takes (Baby V!)
Baby come back to me (Come Back)
I should have never set you free
My baby
Come back
(Baby Come Back!)
