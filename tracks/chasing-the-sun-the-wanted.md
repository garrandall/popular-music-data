I'm better, so much better now
I see the light, touch the light, we're together now
I'm better, so much better now
Look to the skies, gives me life, we're together now


We've only just begun, hypnotized by drums
Until forever comes, you'll find us chasing the sun
They said this day wouldn't come, we refused to run
We've only just begun, you'll find us chasing the sun


Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, you'll find us chasing the sun
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, you'll find us chasing the sun


And when they say life's faded
We're gonna play in the dark 'til it's golden again
And now it feels so amazing
Can't see it coming, I will never grow old again
You'll find us chasing the sun


I'm never, I'm never down
Lying here, staring up, and you're looking down
I'm never, I'm never down
Live forever, forever with you around


We've only just begun, hypnotized by drums
Until forever comes, you'll find us chasing the sun
They said this day wouldn't come, we refused to run
We've only just begun, you'll find us chasing the sun
The sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun
You'll find us chasing the sun


Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, you'll find us chasing the sun
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, you'll find us chasing the sun


And when they say life's faded
We're gonna play in the dark 'til it's golden again
And now it feels so amazing
Can't see it coming, I will never grow old again
You'll find us chasing the sun


You'll find us chasing the sun


And when they say life's faded
We're gonna play in the dark 'til it's golden again
And now it feels so amazing
Can't see it coming, I will never grow old again
You'll find us chasing the sun


Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, you'll find us chasing the sun
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, you'll find us chasing the sun
