(Ten nine eight seven six five four three two one)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Oh)

You set my lips on fire
You won the key to my heart
You've got a special way to move me
Don't stop now let's do it again
You keep me dancing through the moonlight
I feel the pleasure in your touch
And everything you are is heaven
Oh I can't get enough no I can't get enough

(Instant replay) I've got to have it
(Instant replay) ooh whoa ooh-ooh
(Instant replay) got to have your love again

I feel so good about us
I found a shining star
And when I look into your eyes it's magic
Well I just know this can't be a dream
I'm so happy must be real
In every way it's getting stronger
Now you know it let me show it

(Instant replay) I've got to have it
(Instant replay) woo-woo-woo-ooh
(Instant replay) got me floating on a cloud
Got me dancing all around all around all around (woo)

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Eeya-eeya eeya eeya-eeya
D-doo d-doo d-doo-ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
(Instant instant)
(Instant instant instant replay)
Ah ah ah

(Instant replay) instant replay
(Instant replay) instant replay
(Instant replay) woo ooh ooh ah
I can't stand it I can't stand it
Got to have it 'cause I need it
Don't ya know don't ya know don't ya know
I need your love
I need your love love love
(Instant replay) let me show it (instant replay)
(Instant replay) I need your love
(Instant replay instant replay)
Ooh and I'm feeling overcome (instant replay)
