Striking out? Well, count me in
I'm gonna stand right by your side through thick or thin
Ain't no doubt, gonna win
A walk through hell ain't bad compared to where we've been
Oh, you can depend on me
Over and over, over and over, know that I intend to be
The one who, who always makes you laugh until you cry
And you can call on me until the day you die
Years may come and go
Here's one thing I know
All my life
You're a friend of mine
That argument, I can't forget
We fought so hard I don't think I've recovered yet
The girls we knew, who thought you were cool
I never introduced my favorite ones to you
Oh, you can depend on me
Over and over, over and over, know that I intend to be
The one who who always makes you laugh until you cry
And you can call on me until the day you die
Years may come and go
Here's one thing I know
All my life
You're a friend of mine
Oh, you can depend on me
Over and over, over and over, know that I intend to be
The one who who always makes you laugh until you cry
And you can call on me until the day you die
Years may come and go
Here's one thing I know
All my life
You're a friend of mine
Oh, you can depend on me
I'll be fine
'Cause you're a friend of mine
Yeah, I'll be fine
'Cause you're a friend of mine
