I thought I knew, the girl so well
if she was sad I couldn't tell
I missed the point, I missed the signs
so if she's gone the fault is mine,
I know I know, a whole lot of little things
and even though
I could list them 1 by 1,
she would still be gone

Her eyes are blue
her hair was long
64, she was born in Baton Rouge
her favorite song is "In My Life"
I memorized her every move
I knew her books, her car, her clothes
but I paid no attention to what mattered most

I never ask, she never said
and when she cried, I turned my head
she dreamed her dreams, behind closes doors
that made them easy to ignore
and I know I know
I missed the forest for the trees
and all I have to show
oh but she walked out the door
cold facts and nothing more

Her eyes are blue
her hair was long
64, she was born in Baton Rouge
her favorite song is "In My Life"
I memorized her every move
I knew her books, her car, her clothes
but I paid no attention to what mattered most
her eyes are blue
her hair was long
64, she was born in Baton Rouge
her fathers tall
her mothers gone
she moved out west when she was 2
the way she laughed 
the way she loved
oh my God what did I do?
