Until we kissed
I never knew the
Thrills that could be tasted

Until we kissed
I never knew the
Years that I had wasted

But now I know I was
Waiting for you to come by
I was waiting, girl
Won't you please tell me why
This took so long to begin


Darling, where have
You been all my life
Oh, don't you know


That til we touched
I never the knew the
Touch was worth revealing

Until we touched
I never knew my heart
Was really beating

But now I know I was
Waiting for you to come by
I was waiting
Won't you please tell me why
This took so long to begin


Darling, where have
You been all my life


Oh, darling
Where have you been
Where you been
Where you been
When I was feeling blue

Where have you been
Where you been
Where you been
When I was needing you

Oh, where you been
Where you been


Where you been


Now don't you know I was
Waiting for you to come by
I was waiting, girl
Won't you please tell me why
This took so long to begin


Darling, where have
You been all my life


Oh, darling
Where have you been
Where you been
Where you been
When I was feeling blue
Feeling blue

Where have you been
Where you been
Where you been
When I was needing you

Oh, where you been
Where you been
