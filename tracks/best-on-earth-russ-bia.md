I like the way she work she always puts me first
And I know I been around but I swear you got the best on earth

I got drip on the floor and it's getting nasty
He ain't keepin' his hands up off my ass cheeks
I got something to give him and if he ask me
I'm not filling up, baby, I let him gas me

Her ass fatter than fat and she got good throat
Sit that cat on my lap I give it good strokes
I might have to fly her out to Mykonos
Or maybe to Japan so I could hit it like I'm Ichiro
She knows what the fuck is up
I don't gotta dumb it down
Tatted like Rihanna, pussy singing like it's run the town
I love her she's a freak
I promise if I could I'd fuck her 7 days a week
Face from the Middle East
Ass from the West Indies
Suckin the soul up outta my body Rest In Peace
Head got me wobblin
She know I got cameras
She said we should vlog it
I know she got stamina
She said start jogging

I like the way she work she always puts me first
And I know I been around but I swear you got the best on earth

I got drip on the floor and it's getting nasty
He ain't keepin' his hands up off my ass cheeks
I got something to give him and if he ask me
I'm not filling up, baby, I let him gas me

Light me up (Light me up) Light me up
I done see the whole world and ain't no one near hot as us
Bank rolls, dank rolled, they ain't really as loud as us
I be hoping that's it love but it really just be the lust
Anything for a rush now
It's Van Nuys on the touchdown
It's a cold world get a buss down
How you get my mind before my body and my trust now
He say life is too short and he think that we should fuck now
I think I'm finna break him, its gon be quick
He know I ride that dick till I get sea sick
Wavy lil' bitch that talk that East shit, nasty
But don't put nothing past me
Now I got the pussy and the power if you ask me

I like the way she work she always puts me first
And I know I been around but I swear you got the best on earth

I got drip on the floor and it's getting nasty
He ain't keepin' his hands up off my ass cheeks
I got something to give him and if he ask me
I'm not filling up, baby, I let him gas me
