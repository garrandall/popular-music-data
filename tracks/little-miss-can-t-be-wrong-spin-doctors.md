It's been a whole lot easier since the bitch left town
It's been a whole lot happier without her face around
Nobody upstairs a-gonna stomp and shout
Nobody at the back door gonna throw my laundry out
She hold the shotgun while you do-si-do
She want one man made of Hercules and Cyrano
It's been a whole lot easier since the bitch is gone
Little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong

Little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong
Ain't nobody gonna bow no more when you sound your gong
Little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong
Whatcha gon' do to get into another one of these here rock 'n' roll songs?

Other people's thoughts, they ain't your hand-me-downs
Would it be so bad to simply turn around?
You cook so well, all nice and French
You do your brain surgery too, mama, a-with your monkey wrench

Little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong
Ain't nobody gonna bow no more when you sound your gong
Little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong
Whatcha gon' do to get into another one of these here rock 'n' roll songs?

Ay yeah, can't be wrong
No, no, no, you can't be wrong
Oh, you can't be wrong, you can't be wrong
You can't be wrong, no, no, no

I hope them cigarettes are gonna make you cough
I hope you hear this song and it pissed you off
I take that back, I hope you're doing fine
And if I had a dollar, I might give you ninety-nine

Little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong
Ain't nobody gonna bow no more when you sound your gong
Little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong
Whatcha gon' do to get into another one of these here rock 'n' roll songs?

Oh, little miss, little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, you can't be wrong, no, you can't be wrong
You can't be wrong
Oh, little miss, little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong, no
Oh, you can't be wrong
Little miss, little miss, little miss, little miss can't be wrong, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Oh
