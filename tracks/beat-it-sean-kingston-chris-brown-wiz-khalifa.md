He ain't fly, no, he don't even drive, no
That's why you're calling my phone, and won't leave me alone
He ain't even fly though ,you ain't gotta lie no
That's why you're calling my phone
And you're wanting me to get, get, get it


Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
You wantin' me to beat, beat, beat it
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
Not a problem, baby
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
You wantin' me to beat, beat, beat
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
Beat beat

I've been out here looking for a girl like you
You already settled down and loyal to your dude
You got your eyes on me girl, he got his eyes on you
My eyes are on this money and it's nothing he can do


He ain't fly, no, he don't even drive, no
That's why you're calling my phone, and won't leave me alone
He ain't even fly though, you ain't gotta lie no
That's why you're calling my phone
And you're wanting me to get, get, get it


Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
You wantin' me to beat, beat, beat it
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
Not a problem, baby
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
You wantin' me to beat, beat, beat
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
Beat beat


You've been out here lookin' for a guy like me
And I ain't never settled down just loyal to my team


You got your eyes on me, and girl, I got my eyes on green
Your nigga he so bummy, need to boost his self-esteem


Cause he ain't fly, no, he don't t even drive, no (don't drive)
That's why you're calling my phone, and won't leave me alone
He ain't even fly though, you ain't gotta lie no (girl please don't lie)
That's why you're calling my phone
And you're wanting me to get, get, get it


Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
You wantin' me to beat, beat, beat it
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
Not a problem, baby
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
You wantin' me to beat, beat, beat (beat it up)
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
Beat beat


Ugh, you say you want a fly nigga
Roll somethin' and get high nigga
I spendin' all the most and if he ain't coming close then its time to tell him bye
I'll take you up in the sky
We'll be floatin'
Get you wet, like the ocean
I'ma speed up on it, if your pussy was a book I would read up on it
Girl I'm just trying to get you back to my crib
Seen all them Instagram pictures you post so I already know what it is
Talk to me now


He ain't fly, no, he don't t even drive, no (don't drive)
That's why you're calling my phone, and won't leave me alone
He ain't even fly though, you ain't gotta lie no (girl please don't lie)
That's why you're calling my phone
And you're wanting me to get, get, get it


Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
You wantin' me to beat, beat, beat it
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
Not a problem, baby
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
You wantin' me to beat, beat, beat (beat it up)
Beat, beat, beat it, beat, beat, beat it
Beat beat
