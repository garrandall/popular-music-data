Love me with all your heart
That's all I want, love
Love me with all your heart
Or not at all

Just promise me this
That you'll give me
All your kisses every winter
Every summer, every fall

When we are far apart
Or when you're near me
Love me with all your heart
As I love you

Don't give me your love
For a moment or an hour
Love me always as you
Loved me from the start
With every beat of your heart

When we are far apart
Or when you're near me
Love me with all your heart
As I love you

Don't give me your love
For a moment or an hour
Love me always as you
Loved me from the start
With every beat of your heart

With every beat of your heart
Of your heart
