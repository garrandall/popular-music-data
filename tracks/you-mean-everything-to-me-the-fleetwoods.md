To me, oh yes, to me
You know (you know)
I would cry for you
You know, I would die for you
You mean (you mean)
Everything to me, oh yes, to me

You're the girl (yes, you)
In my dreams I see
The one that I long I to see
You mean (you mean)
Everything to me, oh yes, to me

Well, you know
I love you forever
Well, you know
I'll never stop (never stop)

You're the girl (yes, you)
In my dreams I see
The one that I long I to see
You mean (you mean)
Everything to me, oh yes, to me

Well, you know
I love you forever
Well, you know
I'll never stop (never stop)

You know (you know)
I would cry for you
You know, I would die for you
You mean (you mean)
Everything to me, oh yes, to me

To me, oh yes, to me
