Yo, need you to understand me Daddy

Doin' it dawg, I'm well established
I ain't tryin to lead ya on
Just wanna ask if ya might wanna
Gimme ya name, explain your status
Ya know I see ya time to time
You seem available
Don't mean shit

Gotta say you on my short list, a few
Them other dudes is OK
But I'm feelin' you
Want ya in the best way
So whatchu gone do about it
Why don't you just test me
You won't wanna do without it
No I'm comin' at you hard
Meetin' a thug
And I ain't givin' up 
Till I get that gangsta love


I just wanna rock you
All night long, ohh
I wanna rock you
I just wanna rock you
All night long, ohh


I know you see me this night that night
Always my shit tight
Hair done, outfit crazy
Skirts fit just right
Wife beater wit' a bangin' tan
Walk in demandin' all eyes
Baby here I am
Ain't ashamed of my frame
And I know your watchin'
Puttin on a show for you Pop
And I ain't stoppin
Lotta action and ya horny
And you gonna too
Only thing to make it better tho
Is me wit' you
And I know your feelin' that
Regardless of your frontin'
And I heard through the streets
It was me you wantin'
Lemme find out you shy or somethin'
But I know your not
So stop the game and approach 
Is you real or not


I just wanna rock you
All night long, ohh
I wanna rock you
I just wanna rock you
All night long, ohh


OK, numbers exchanged
Now it's in play
Shouldn't a took you so long
In the first place
I'm just playin' cutie
Yeah give me a call
No it's cool
You ain't gotta see me to my car
I'm a big girl 
But you'll find out
Stuck for me
While I drop top and ride out
Wheels spinnin'
Wanna know what shorty all about
But it's cool, Im doin' 
And these words is comin' out my mouth


It's that gangsta lovin'
That just got me buggin'
It's that gangsta lovin'
That just got me buggin'


I just wanna rock you
All night long, ohh
I wanna rock you

All night long, ohh

Why won't you be my baby
I wanna be ya lady
I wanna rock you baby
