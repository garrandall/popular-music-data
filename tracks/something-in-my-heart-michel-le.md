You took my love and I'm willing
But there's no limit to the love I'm giving
The love I'm giving, Ooooooooo..


There's no reason why
We should be apart
Ooh, Oh Baby
Cause searching for something out there
Will leave two lonely hearts
Two lonely hearts


Baby don't you know?
We've come to far to let it all end
I've told you over and over again
How I feel inside but if you go
Oooh baby, there's something you should know


Something you should know
There's something in my heart
Something in my heart, something in my heart
Ooh it's got me hooked on you


Baby if we try
Things will get better
No one can tell me different
We should be together
Baby don't you know?


The changes I'm going through
You know I'll never be the same
Your love has touched me so
There's no one else to blame
But you...


We've come too far to let it all end
I've told you over and over again
How I feel inside but if you go
Ooh baby there's something you should know
Something you should know


There's something you should know
There's something in my heart
Something in my heart, something in my heart
Ooh it's got me hooked on you
