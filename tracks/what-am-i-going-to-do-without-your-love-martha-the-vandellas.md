(Since you've been gone I've been cryin' all night long, I've been sad)

I see my tear-stained face when I look in my mirror
I stare in space as night grows nearer, cryin'
I need you, baby, I need you
I need you, baby, I need you
I just sit & wonder, did you fall for someone else?
'Cause if I hurt you, baby, I really hurt myself, oh
I need you, yes I really need you
I need you, you know I need you

What am I gonna do without your love?
What am I gonna do without you, baby?
I'm slowly slowly goin' crazy
I need you, I really really need you

I just sit & mope by myself; like part of my household fixtures
These arms of mine are holdin', clingin' to your picture, cryin'
I need you, yes I need you
I need you, baby, I need you
Come on, come on right now, baby
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, oh
I need you, yes I really need you

What am I gonna do without your love?
What can I do without you, baby?
I'm slowly slowly goin' crazy
I can't stand it, I just can't stand it
Here's a broken heart & a love that's slowly dyin'
A room full of tears & a heart, a heart that's cryin', oh
I need you, yes I really need you
I need you, you know that I need you
Come on, come on right now, baby
If you love me, come back, baby
Oooo yeah, baby, oh tell me right now

What am I gonna do without your love?
What can I do without you?
Come on, come on back to me, baby
... & fade
