She's a brick house
She's mighty, mighty
Just lettin' it all hang out
She's a brick house
I like ladies stacked
And that's a fact
Ain't holding nothing back

She's a brick house
Well, we're together everybody knows
This is how the story goes

She knows she's got everything
That a woman needs to get a man
How can she lose with the stuff she use?
36-24-36, what a winning hand

'Cause she's a brick house
She's mighty, mighty
Just lettin' it all hang out
She's a brick house
I like ladies stacked
And that's a fact
Ain't holding nothing back

She's a brick house
She's the one, the only one
Built like an Amazon

The clothes she wear, her sexy ways
Make a old man wish for younger days
She knows she's built and knows how to please
Sure enough can knock a strong man to his knees

'Cause she's a brick house
She's mighty, mighty
Just lettin' it all hang out
A brick house
I like ladies stacked
That's a fact
Ain't holding nothing back

Shake it down, shake it down now
A shake it down, shake it down now
A shake it down, shake it down now
A shake it down, shake it down now
A shake it down, shake it down now
A shake it down, shake it down now
A shake it down, shake it down now

Brick house
She's mighty, mighty
Just lettin' it all hang out
Brick house
She's the one, the only one
Built like an Amazon

Shake it down, shake it down, shake it down now!
Shake it down, shake it down, shake it down now!
Shake it down, shake it down, shake it down now!
Shake it down, shake it down, shake it, shake it

Shake it down, shake it down, shake it down now!
Shake it down, shake it down, shake it down now!
Shake it down, shake it down, shake it down now!
Shake it down, shake it down, shake it!

A brick house
