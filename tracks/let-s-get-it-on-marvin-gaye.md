I’ve been really trying, baby
Trying to hold back this feeling for so long
And if you feel like I feel baby
Come on, oh come on, oh


Let’s get it on, ow baby
Let’s get it on, let’s love baby
Let’s get it on, sugar
Let’s get it on, woo


We’re all sensitive people with so much to give
Understand me, sugar
Since we got to be, let’s live, I love you
There’s nothing wrong with me loving you, baby no no
And giving yourself to me can never be wrong
If the love is true, oh baby oh


Don’t you know how sweet and wonderful life can be, ohooh
I’m asking you baby to get it on with me, ohoohhoh
I ain't gonna worry, I ain't gonna push, I won't push you baby
So come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, baby
Stop beating round the bush, hey


Let's get it on, let's get it on
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Come on baby, let your love come out
If you believe in love
Let's get it on, let's get it on baby
This minute, oh yeah let's get it on
Please, let's get it on hey hey


I know you know what I been dreamin' of, don't you baby?
My whole body makes that feelin' of love, I'm happy
I ain't gonna worry, no I ain't gonna push
I won't push you baby, woo
Come on, come on, come on, come on darling
Stop beatin' round the bush, hey


Oh, gonna get it on, threatenin' you, baby
I wanna get it on
You don't have to worry that it's wrong
If the spirit moves you
Let me groove you good
Let your love come down
Oh, get it on, come on baby
Do you know the meaning?
I've been sanctified, hey hey
Girl, you give me good feeling
So good somethin' like sanctified
Oh dear I, baby
Nothing wrong with love
If you want to love me just let your self go
Oh baby, let's get it on
