If you wanna give up, take a chance
When the party’s over, you should have the last dance
If there's no direction and you can’t see
Let your heart draw a map in the stars and go where it leads


Cause I can give you hope
But I can’t show you how
Only you can turn the light on
Find your way back out
It may be dark and winding
But it leads you home
I know, yes, I know


There’s no shame, love, in falling apart
Nothing comes easy but it won’t always be
No, it won’t be always be so hard


Oh, ohohoh
Down that road
Oh, ohohoh
Oh oh oh oh


I can give you hope
But I can’t show you how
Only you can turn the light on
Find your way back out
It may be dark and winding
But it leads you home
I know, yes, I know
Cause I’ve been down that road
Down that road
I’ve been down that road
