So you heard that I'm a rebel 
With a heart made of stone
I got a restless spirit 
That nobody can own

If a picture tells a story
Won't you listen to mine
I'm searching for the answer 
But it's so hard to find

You'll see much deeper 
When you read between the lines
'Cause there's a fire 
Burning in my eyes

Like a thief in the night 
Who can't get enough
I am willing to fight 
'Cause I'm a soldier of love

Like a shot in the dark 
When the goin' gets rough
It's a state of the heart 
When you're a soldier of love
I willing to fight

Love can be so heartless 
When you turn out the lights
A mutual surrender 
In the heat of the night

Life's an empty picture 
when you're living alone
Maybe that's the reason 
Every heart needs a home

Each time I fall down 
I get on my feet again
I'm gonna win this battle 
In the end

Like a thief in the night 
Who can't get enough
I am willing to fight 
'Cause I'm a soldier of love

Like a shot in the dark 
When the goin' gets rough
It's a state of the heart 
When you're a soldier of love

You'll see much deeper 
When you read between the lines
Cause there's a fire 
Burning in my eyes

Like a thief in the night 
Who can't get enough
I am willing to fight 
'Cause I'm a soldier of love

Like a shot in the dark 
When the goin' gets rough
It's a state of the heart 
When you're a soldier of love

Shalalalalala, when the goin' gets rough
Shalalalalala, I'm a soldier of love
Shalalalalala, when the goin' gets rough
Shalalalalala, a soldier for your love

Like a thief in the night 
Who can't get enough
I am willing to fight 
'Cause I'm a soldier of love

Like a shot in the dark 
When the goin' gets rough
It's a state of the heart 
When you're a soldier of love
