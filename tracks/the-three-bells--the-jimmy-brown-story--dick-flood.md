There's a village hidden deep in the valley
Among the pine trees half forlorn
And there on a sunny morning
Little jimmy brown was born
(Bung, bung, bung, bung)
All the chapel bells were ringing in the little valley town
And the song that they were singing was for baby jimmy brown
Then the little congregation prayed for guidance from above
"Lead us not into temptation, bless this hour of meditation"
"Guide him with eternal love"
There's a village hidden deep in the valley
Beneath the mountains high above
And there, twenty years thereafter
Jimmy was to meet his love
(Bung, bung, bung, bung)
All the chapel bells were ringing, 'twas a great day in his life
'Cause the songs that they were singing was for jimmy and his wife
Then the little congregation prayed for guidance from above
"Lead us not into temptation, bless, oh lord this celebration"
"May their lives be filled with love"
>from the village hidden deep in the valley
One rainy morning dark and gray
A soul winged its way to heaven
Jimmy brown had passed away
(Bung, bung, bung, bung)
Just a lonely bell was ringing in the little valley town
'Twas farewell that it was singing to our little jimmy brown
And the little congregation prayed for guidance from above
"Lead us not into temptation, may his soul find the salvation"
"Of thy great eternal love"
