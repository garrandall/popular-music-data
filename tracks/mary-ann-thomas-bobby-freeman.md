Mary Ann Thomas
Remember your promise
Mary Ann Thomas
You be true to me

You're my lover
Don't want any other
Mary Ann Thomas
Love me faithfully

Someone told me you went with Joe
To the Friday night movie show
Don't you know you're supposed to be
Dating nobody else but me

Oh, Mary Ann Thomas
Remember your promise
Mary Ann Thomas
You be true to me

Mary Ann Thomas
Remember your promise
Mary Ann Thomas
You be true to me

You're my lover
Don't want any other
Mary Ann Thomas
Love me faithfully

Someone told me you went with Joe
To the Friday night movie show
Don't you know you're supposed to be
Dating nobody else but me

Oh, Mary Ann Thomas
Remember your promise
Mary Ann Thomas
You be true to me
