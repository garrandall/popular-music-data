Love and affection, a heart so true
A-yours for the asking
I've got it alright a-here for you

You needn't be lonely, you shouldn't be blue
I'll design a life of love for you
And here's all you've got to do

When you need a good loving
When you need a good kissing
When you need a good hugging
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Won't you call on me?

You can't live alone dear
Your whole life through
Everybody needs a future
And I can see my future in you

When you need a good loving

When you need a good hugging
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You can't live alone dear

When you need a good kissing
When you need a good loving, yeah, yeah
Won't you call on me?
Won't you call on me?
