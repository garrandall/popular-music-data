Alone until my eighteenth year, we met four springs ago
She was shy and had a fear of things she did not know
But we got it on together in such a super way, held each other
Close at night and traded dreams each day, and

She said, "Rocky I've never been in love before, don't know if I can do it
But if you let me lean on you, take my hand I might get through it
Oh and I said, " Baby oh sweet baby it's love will set us free, and
God knows if the world should end your love is safe with me

We found an old grey house and you would not believe the way
We worked at night to fix it up took classes in the day, paintin
Walls and sippin wine sleepin on the floor, With so much love for
Just two soon we found there'd be one more

She said, "Rocky I've never had a baby before, don't know if I can do it
But if you let me lean on you, take my hand I might get through it
Oh and I said, " Baby oh sweet baby it's love will set us free, and
God knows if the world should end your love is safe with me

We had lots of problems yeah but we had lots of fun, like the crazy
Party when our baby girl turned one, I was proud and satisfied
Life had so much to give, til the day they told me that she didn't have
Long to live

She said, "Rocky I've never had to die before, don't know if I can do it..."
Now it's back to two again
The little girl and I
Who looks so much like her sweet mother
Sometimes it makes me cry
I sleep alone at nights again
I walk alone each day
And sometimes when I'm about to give in
I hear her sweet voice say, to me

"Rocky, you know you've been alone before
You know that you can do it
But if you'd like to lean on me
Take my hand, I'll help you through it" (through it)
I said, "Baby, oh sweet baby
It's love that sets us free
And I told you when the world would end
Your love was safe with me"

She said
"Rocky, you know you've been alone before
You know that you can do it
But if you'd like to lean on me...
