Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby, shoo-bop, shoo-bop

Hello, stranger
It seems so good to see you back again
How long has it been?
It seems like a mighty long time
(Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby)
It seems like a mighty long time

I my, my, my, my, I'm so glad
You stopped by to say "Hello" to me
Remember that's the way it used to be
It seems like a mighty long time
(Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby)
It seems like a mighty long time

(Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby, shoo-bop, shoo-bop)
(Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby, shoo-bop, shoo-bop)
Yes I'm so glad you're here again
(Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby, shoo-bop, shoo-bop)
(Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby)

If you're not gonna stay
Please don't tease me like you did before
Because I still love you so although
It seems like a mighty long time
(Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby)
It seems like a mighty long time

(Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby, shoo-bop, shoo-bop)
I my, my, my, my
(Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby, shoo-bop, shoo-bop)
I'm so happy
(Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby, shoo-bop, shoo-bop)
You're here again
(Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby)

(Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby, shoo-bop, shoo-bop)
Seems like a mighty long time
(Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby, shoo-bop, shoo-bop)
Feel so good
(Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby, shoo-bop, shoo-bop)
To have you back again
(Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby)

How long has it been?
(Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby, shoo-bop, shoo-bop)
(Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby, shoo-bop, shoo-bop)
(Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby, shoo-bop, shoo-bop)
