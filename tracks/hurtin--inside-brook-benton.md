She told me she loved me
She told me a lie
She said I'd be happy
She made me cry

I'm hurting, hurting
Hurting inside

She called me her baby
In front of the guys
She was just flirting
I wasn't wise

I'm hurting, hurting
Hurting inside

Tell me, what's wrong with me
Why should I live in misery

Someday she'll be sorry
Just wait and see
Someone's gonna hurt her
Like she hurt me

She'll be hurting
Hurting inside

Tell me, what's wrong with me
Why should I live in misery

Someday she'll be sorry
Just wait and see
Someone's gonna hurt her
Like she hurt me

She'll be hurting inside
She'll be hurting
Hurting inside
Just like she hurt me
She's gonna be hurt inside

Hurting, hurting inside
