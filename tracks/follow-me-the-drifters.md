I'm getting tired of doing nothing
Wasting time
I know there's got to be a new place
I can find, yeah

Somewhere I'll be free and satisfied
But, baby, I will need you by my side
Oh, can't you hear me calling you
Calling you, Calling you

Follow me, yeah (follow me)
I've two arms as strong
As iron holding you (do do do)
And with these arms, I wanna
Do things, yes, I do

I wanna be a someone in this town
But someone's always
Trying to put me down
Oh, can't you hear me calling you
Calling you, calling you

Follow me (follow me, follow me)
I've got somewhere to go
(Follow me) we'll be
Happy there, I know

We'll dance and sing, everything
We'll have a good time together
Just you wait and see

We gotta pack our bags and
Leave here right away (do do do)
If we don't catch the next bus, baby
We might stay, yeah

And that would be the
End of me, I know (yeah)
So, come on, baby
Grab your things, let's go
Oh, can't you hear me calling you
Calling you, calling you

Follow me, yeah (follow me)
Follow me (follow me)
Oh, can't you hear me calling you
Calling you, calling you

Follow me (follow me)
Oh, you got to follow me...
