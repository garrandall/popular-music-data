If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know
I'll think of you each step of the way


And I will always love you
I will always love you


Bittersweet memories
That's all I'm taking with me
Goodbye, please don't cry
We both know that I'm not what you need


But I will always love you
I will always love you


I hope life treats you kind
And I hope that you have all
That you ever dreamed of
And I wish you joy and happiness
But above all this, I wish you love


And I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
