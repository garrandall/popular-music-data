Roll in the bar, me and my crew
Their little plan to get me over you
They're hookin’ me up, yeah
Buyin’ me drinks with a thousand girls
There's just one thing


I can't go anywhere, I can't do anything
No, I can't close my eyes without you in my dreams
You won't leave me alone, even though I know you're gone
I look around for someone new, but I see you
Jumpin’ up there with the band
Takin’ me by the hand
Hey boy, come dance with me
Stuck like a melody in my head
In the bed of my truck
By the light of the midnight moon
Baby, I see you


Don't know what you did, but you done it good
You don't know how bad that I wish I could
Delete you from my phone, find a girl and take her home
But there's just one thing wrong


I can't go anywhere, I can't do anything
No, I can't close my eyes without you in my dreams
You won't leave me alone, even though I know you're gone
I look around for someone new, but I see you
Jumpin’ up there with the band
Takin’ me by the hand
Hey boy, come dance with me
Stuck like a melody in my head
In the bed of my truck
By the light of the midnight moon
Baby, I see you


Your lips, your eyes
Girl, since you told me goodbye


I can't go anywhere, I can't do anything
No, I can't close my eyes without you in my dreams
You won't leave me alone, even though I know you're gone
I look around for someone new, but I see you
Jumpin’ up there with the band
Takin’ me by the hand
Hey boy, come dance with me
Stuck like a melody in my head
In the bed of my truck
By the light of the midnight moon
Baby, I see you


Baby, I see you
Baby, I see you
