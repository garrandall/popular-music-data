Take it on back
Take it on back
Take it on back to where the grass is greener
Yeah.
Huh, Alright.

She was a south Georgia stunner
Hotter than hell in July
We tasted heaven that summer
Then said good-bye and I don't know why 'cause
We'd park down by the river
Steam up them windows real good
I Wish I could go back and see her
You know I would lord if I could

Take it on back
Take it on back
Take it on back to where the grass is greener
Take it on back
Take it on back
Back to when she and me were true believers
In love and all the things that come with it
Moonshine kisses, man I miss it
Take it on back
Take it on back 
Back to the best I ever had
Take it on (take it on, take it on)
Take it on back

Yeah!
Well I wonder if she ever wonders
If I'm thinkin' 'bout her too
'Cause I'm thinkin' I still love her
If she only knew all I wanna do

Is take it on back
Take it on back
Take it on back to where the grass is greener
Take it on back
Take it on back
Back to when she and me were true believers
In love and all the things that come with it
Moonshine kisses, man I miss it
Take it on back
Take it on back 
Back to the best I ever had
Take it on (take it on, take it on)
Take it on back

Take it on back to the truck bed blanket
Holdin' that girl 'til the sun come up
Take it on back to our song and crank it
Turn it up loud I can see her now

Take it on back
Take it on back
Back to where the grass is greener
Take it on back
Take it on back
Back to when she and me were true believers
In love and all the things that come with it
Moonshine kisses, man I miss it
Take it on back
Take it on back 
Back to the best I ever had
Take it on (take it on, take it on)
Take it on back

Take it on back
T-T-T Take it on back
(Take it on back, take it on back)
Yeah I said take it on back
(Take it on back, take it on back)
Whoa Yeah!
Take it on back
(Take it on back, take it on back, take it on back to where the grass is greener)
Take it on back
Take it on back
