I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming


I'm back where I belong (yeah)
I never felt so strong, man (I'm back, baby)
I feel like there's nothing I can't try
And if you feel me put your hands high (put your hands high)
If you ever lost a light before, this one's for you
(Baby, put your hands high)
And you, the dreams are for you

I hear the "Tears of a Clown," uh, I hate that song
I always feel like they're talking to me, when it comes on (come on)
Another day, another dawn
Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math, I'm gone
What am I supposed to do when the club lights come on?
It's easy to be Puff but it's harder to be Sean
What if my twins ask why I ain't marry their mom?
Damn, how do I respond?
What if my son stares with a face like my own
And says he wants to be like me when he's grown?
Shit! But I ain't finished growing
Another night, the inevitable prolongs
Another day, another dawn
Just tell Keisha and Teresa I'll be better in the morn'
(I'll be better in the morn')
Another lie that I carry on
I need to get back to the place where I belong


I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home


"A House Is Not a Home," I hate this song
Is a house really a home when your loved ones is gone?
And niggas got the nerve to blame you for it
And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it
But you felt it, and still feel it
And money can't make up for it or conceal it
But you deal with it (deal with it), and you keep ballin'
Pour out some liquor, playboy, and we keep ballin' (ballin')
Baby, we've been living in sin
Cause we've been really in love, but we been living as friends
So you've been a guest in your own home
It's time to make your house your home
Pick up your phone, come on


I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming


"Ain't No Stopping Us Now," I love that song
Whenever it comes on, it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop
Til we back cruising through Harlem, these old blocks
It's what made me, saved me, drove me crazy
Drove me away, then embraced me
Forgave me for all of my shortcomings
Welcome to my homecoming
Yeah, it's been a long time coming
Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles
Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs
Made it back, lost my dog (I miss you Big!)
But here I stand (here I stand), a better man
Thank you, Lord! Thank you all


I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming
