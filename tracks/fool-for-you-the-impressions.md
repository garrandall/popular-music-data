Never liked nobody
That's been mean to me
I've got a heart full of stone
And I hate the misery
Then you came along
Into my life
Destroying me more
Mounting up the toil and strife


But I'm a fool for you
I'm a fool for ya
I'm a fool for you
I'm a fool for ya
Guess I'll always be
And I claim it famously
'Cause I'm a fool for ya


It's a doggone shame
Knowin' you don't love me
You go on and use me
So continuously
I don't know why
I love you like I do
When you're breaking my heart
And you know it's true


But I'm a fool for you
I'm a fool for ya
I'm a fool for you
I'm a fool for ya
Doggin' me every day
But child, I'm here to stay
'Cause I'm a fool for ya


You don't want me to stay
But I'm a fool for you
Do me wrong now every day
Child, I'm a fool for ya
Ah-ha-ha-hoo
I'm a fool for you
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-hoo
Child, I'm a fool for you
Hoo hoo hoo hoo
I'm a fool for you
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-hoo
