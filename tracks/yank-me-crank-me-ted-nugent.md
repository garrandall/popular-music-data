I need you, baby
Like a dog needs a bone
I need you, baby
Like a man needs a home

I need you, baby
Like a cloud needs a rain
But I've got to have you
Cause you drove me insane


Well, you can yank me
And you can crank me
But don't you wake up
And don't you try to thank me

I need you, baby
Like a dog needs a bone
I think I got one of my own

I like your legs
They're soft to the touch
Wrapped around me
I like it so much

I need you, baby
And a couple your friends
I'll bring em round
And we can do it again


You're wasting my time



I said, I need you, baby
Like this dog needs a bone
I need you, baby
Like some man needs a home

I like your legs
They feel so soft to the touch
Wrap em round my face, baby
I think I dig it so much

Well, you can yank me
I said, crank me
But don't you waste my time
I don't want you woken up
Just so you can thank me
