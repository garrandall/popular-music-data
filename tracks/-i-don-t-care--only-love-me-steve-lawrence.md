Oh I don't care how much you love me
Only love me
For my love for you is great enough for two

Oh I don't care what you think of me
Just think of me
For in time my love may change your point of view

Every tender little kiss
Will be a little more of bliss
I ever tasted before
I'll do my very best
To make it more and more

Oh I don't care how much you love me
Only love me

Rome was not built in a day, it's true
And romance works the same way too
Someday I pray you'll love me
Half as much as I love you

Oh I don't care what you think of me
Just think of me
For in time my love may change your point of view

Every tender little kiss
Will be a little more of bliss
I ever tasted before
I'll do my very best
To make it more and more

Rome was not built in a day, it's true
And romance works the same way too
Someday I pray you'll love me
Half as much as I love you

Half as much as I love you!
