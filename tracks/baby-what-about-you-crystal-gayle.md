Everybody thinks I'm crazy it's going around
The girl is headed for a heart break she's going down
They say I'm always wanting something that I can't have
Baby what about you

Everybody says you really ought to go home
Tell the man that you love him when you're all alone
I don't really think that that's something I can do
Baby what about you

Sometimes late at night when I'm missing you
And I'm calling out your name
I don't know if it's wrong I don't know if it's right
But I follow my heart just the same

I don't really think I'm crazy for taking my time
I'm just looking for the answers I've gotta find
They say it's gonna be a long hard ride
Baby what about you
