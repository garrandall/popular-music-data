It was a Saturday night without a whole lot shakin'
Ooh my, ooh my, I was bored
I had my best duds on, it was a chance worth takin'
Somehow I was still ignored

Been too long since I been shy and lonely
Ooh, but that's okay
Need some gal to be my one and only
Ooh

I got a wink and a smile from a flashy filly
Ooh my, ooh my, she looked grand
She said, "I like your style, now don't go actin' silly"
Ooh my, ooh, she grabbed my hand

Never thought that I could shake and groove it
Now I'm a dancin' fool
Dug my feet 'cause they could really move it
Ooh

She got the message across and me and her got kissin'
Ooh my, ooh my, havin' fun
I know that this is the thing that I been really missin'
One more dance has just begun

No more time for feelin' shy and lonely
Now I'm a dancin' fool
Found some gal to be my one and only
Ooh, I'm a dancin' fool
Been too long since I been shy and lonely
Now I'm a dancin' fool (I'm a dancin' fool, I'm a dancer)
Been too long since I been shy and lonely
Now I'm a dancin' fool (I'm a dancin' fool, I'm a dancer)
Been too long, been too long
Now I'm a dancin' fool
Been too long since I been shy and lonely
Now I'm a dancin' fool
Been too long, been too long
Now I'm a dancin' fool (I'm a dancin' fool, I'm a dancer)
Been too long since I been shy and lonely
Now I'm a dancin' fool
