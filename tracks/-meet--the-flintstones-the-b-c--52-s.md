Yabba dabba doo

Flintstones, meet the Flintstones
There the modern stone age family
From the town of Bedrock
There a page right out of history

Let's ride with the family down the street
Through the courtesy of Fred's two feet
When you're with the Flintstones
Have a yabba dabba doo time, a dabba doo time
We'll have a gay old time

The Flintstones

Flintstones, meet the Flintstones
There the modern stone age family
From the town of Bedrock
There a page right out of history

Someday, maybe Fred will win the fight
Then the cat will stay out for the night
When you're with the Flintstones
Have a yabba dabba doo time, a dabba doo time
We'll have a gay old time
We'll have a gay old time
Yeah!
