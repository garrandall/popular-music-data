Dancin', romancin', but no second chancin', nothing more
Runnin' and hidin', slippin' and slidin' across the floor
She comes alone every night on her own lookin' for romance
She stands there watching while everyone's touching
She'd take a chance
Standing there waiting, anticipating

How could this go wrong, so many lovers holdin' on
How could this go wrong, another night goes on and on

Now everyone's fakin', hearts have been breakin' across the floor
He's on the makin', she's for the takin', nothing more
From the look in her eyes she is desperately searching for something to say
And as he calls her over, they're getting closer, she'll find a way
Looking for something, suddenly touching

How could this go wrong, it's what she needed all along
How could this go wrong, and so the night goes on and on

Dancin', romancin', no second chancin' across the floor
He's on the makin', she's for the takin', nothing more
Still she comes alone every night on her own lookin' for romance
She stands there watching while everyone's touching
She'd take a chance
Standing there waiting, anticipating
Lookin' for something, suddenly touching

How could this go wrong, she thought he loved her all along
How could this go wrong, so many lovers holding on
How could this go wrong, she thought he loved her all along
How could this go wrong, and so the night goes on and on
