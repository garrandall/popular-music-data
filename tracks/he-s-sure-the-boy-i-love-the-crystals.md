I always dreamed the boy I loved would come along
And he'd be tall and handsome, rich and strong.
Now that boy I love has come to me,
But he sure ain't the way I thought he'd be.

He doesn't look like a movie star,
He doesn't drive a Cadillac car,
He sure ain't the boy I've been dreamin' of,
But he's sure the boy I love.
Let me tell ya now,

He' never be a big business man
He always buys on the installment plan
He sure ain't the boy I been dreamin' of,
But he's sure the boy I love.

When he holds me tight,
Everythings right,
Crazy as it seems,
I'm his, whatever he is,
And I forget all of my dreams,
And everybody knows...

He doesn't hang diamonds round my neck,
And all he's got's an unemployment check
He sure ain't the boy I been dreamin' of,
But he's sure the boy I love.

When he holds me tight,
Everythings right,
Crazy as it seems,
I'm his, whatever he is,
And I forget all of my dreams,
And everybody knows...

He doesn't hang diamonds round my neck,
And all he's got's an unemployment check
He sure ain't the boy I been dreamin' of,
But he's sure the boy I love.
He's sure the boy I love
He's sure the boy I love...
