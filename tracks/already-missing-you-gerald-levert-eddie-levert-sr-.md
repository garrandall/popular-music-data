Aw girl what's up? Aw not again
So you're packin' your bags and you're leaving?
But that ain't right
You need to stay awhile think about it
But wait a minute
Before you go there's just one thing I want you to know

We both agree that this love ain't what it used to be
We just grew apart
I got nothin' but love for you baby
Girl you'll always be my heart

It's gonna be strange
Living without you
Ain't felt so empty before, no
See I miss your smile
And even your fussin'
When I left my clothes on the floor
Oh baby say now

I'm gonna miss your face
I'm gonna miss your moods
I'm gonna miss makin' love to you
And even though you haven't gone yet
I'm already missing you
I'm already missing you

It's hard to say goodbye but things will be better
You go your way and I will go mine
Let's keep in touch, let me know how you're doing
Girl things will change in time

Don't want you to leave
Keep sayin' I'm sorry
But I guess I'm repeating myself
Girl you know I'm here
When you need a shoulder
I can't see you in the arms
Of someone else, oh baby

I'm gonna miss your face
I'm gonna miss your moods
I'm gonna miss makin' love to you
And even though you haven't gone yet
I'm already missing you

I'm gonna miss your face
I'm gonna miss your moods
I'm gonna miss makin' love to you
And even though you haven't gone yet
I'm already missing you

I'm already missing you
I'm already missing you
I'm already missing you
I'm already missing you
