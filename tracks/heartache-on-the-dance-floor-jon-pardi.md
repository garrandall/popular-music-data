Yeah, I was just hanging out
Some little west coast town
Found a bar out by the sand, so I made my way in
First thing that caught my eye, like nothing I'd ever seen
Sunburned auburn hair, a California dream
Yeah, she was shaking them hips
To some old motown song
I couldn't say anything so I sang along

She was a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, she's moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?

So I just hung around this little west coast town
I drop by every night, I stay till closing time
My little mystery, that girl is killing me
So I put on that song just to sing along

She was a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, she's moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
She's got me mesmerized, she's all I'm thinking about
All I think about, think about, think about

So I'm right here right now
Humming this little song
If I could say a thing
I'd want you to know

You were a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, you're moving through my mind
I gotta know your name and I gotta see you again
And if you're listening, listening, listening
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Girl, I'm hanging around this little town
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
