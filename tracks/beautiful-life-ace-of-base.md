What a beautiful morning
The best in life is free

What a beautiful morning
Believe me

What a mystery
Though the world's on fire
Yesterday's hard words is still in my head
I feel no despair
No regrets or sorrows
Cause this new day
Makes me dance on air

What a golden day

What a beautiful morning in my life
The best in life is free
I give it all away
And I wonder what more is to come
And this beautiful morning changed my mind
Believe me when I say 
The shadows fading out

As the day grows bright
We are turning pages
And we write new chapters of our life
Some are strong and long
Others weak with sorrows
Keep the focus on the rising sun

What a golden day

What a beautiful morning in my life
The best in life is free
I give it all away
And I wonder what more is to come
And this beautiful morning changed my mind
Believe me when I say 
Shadows fading out 

Believe me - crows will always fly
Believe me - they are only birds
You have to
You have to let go and you will see things in a different light

What a beautiful morning
What a beautiful morning
Believe me

What a beautiful
What a beautiful morning...

Believe me
