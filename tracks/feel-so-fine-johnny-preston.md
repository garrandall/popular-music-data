Feel so fine, a little girl now you're mine
Come a let me hug ya, come a let me kiss ya
Come a let me see what I been missin'
Feel (I feel) so grand (so grand)
Now that you come back home

Well you look so good
Oh baby like I know you would
Come a let me hug ya, come a let me kiss ya
Come a let me see what I been missin'
(I feel) feel so grand (so grand)
Now that you've come back home

Feel so fine, a little girl now you're mine
Come a lem-me hug ya, come a lem-me kiss ya
Come let me see what I been missin'
Feel (I feel) so grand (so grand)
Now that you've come back home

Well you, look so good
Oh baby like I know you would
Come let me hug you and come let me kiss you
Come let me see what I been missin'
Cause I (I feel) so grand (so grand)
Now that you've come back home

Well I feel, feel, feel so fine (so fine)
Yes a little girl now you're mine (so fine)
Come a let me hug ya, come a let me kiss ya
Come let me see what I been missin'
Feel (I feel) so grand (so grand)
