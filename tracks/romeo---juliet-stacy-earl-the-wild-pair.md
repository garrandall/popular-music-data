Oh
(Romeo and Juliet)
Baby, don't ever forget
(No, no, no)
We're just like Romeo and Juliet

Baby, let's feel the love that'll last forever
And ever and ever
Baby, baby
Let's feel the love that never dies this time

I know we can do it
(We can do it)
If we only stick together, oh
I know we can do it
If we try
(We'll try)

You see
I believe that we've got a chance
For the storybook romance

Let's be like Romeo and Juliet
Lovers till the end of the line
(Till the end of the line)

However trying times we get
I'll be yours
(I'll be yours)
If you will be mine
(If you will be mine)

Just like Romeo and Juliet
Ain't nothing gonna tear us apart
(I got you right in my heart)
Just say the words
So I'll never forget
(I'm your Romeo, you're my Juliet)

We've got the roots in a lifetime love
The kind you spend your whole life dreaming of
You know I believe that we've got a chance
For a storybook romance

I know that we can do it
Like Romeo and Juliet
Lovers til the end
'Til the end
The end of the line

However trying times we get
I'll be yours
(I'll be yours)
If you will be mine
(If you will be mine)

Just like Romeo and Juliet
Ain't nothing gonna tear us apart
(Ain't nothing gonna tear us apart)

One thing, baby
You'll never forget
You're my Romeo
I'm your Juliet

And, baby, once in a lifetime
There's a present from the heavens above
Baby, once in a lifetime
You'll find this kind of love

Do you believe it can last forever?
I want a love that'll never die
I had a dream we would live together
Oh, just like
Oh, just like

I'll be your lover, baby
I wanna drive you crazy
I wanna do it like
Romeo and Juliet

No other one can do me
The things you're doing to me
It's like we're into movies
Romeo and Juliet

I'll be your lover, baby
I wanna drive you crazy
I wanna do it like
Romeo and Juliet

No other one can do me
The things you're doing to me
It's like we're into movies
Romeo and Juliet

I'll be your lover, baby
I wanna drive you crazy
I wanna do it like
Romeo and Juliet

No other one can do me
