Oh yeah, ohyeah
Oh yeah, listen

If this your favorite song, turn your radio on
Play it for your man or your lady all day long
If this your favorite song, turn your radio on
Play it for your man or your lady all day long

It's amazin', babe, how I let it go
On and on for this long
You blamin' me, I'm blamin' you
I can't say you're right, but I sure ain't wrong

Girl, lately I, I've been thinkin'
And my thoughts are tellin' me, I'm trippin'
Used to say I didn't care
Found your bags packed upstairs
With all that talkin' tough, I'm 'bout to lose you

If this is my last chance to love you
I'm gonna play it like a grown man ought to
If I only got one shot to win you
Then call me Jordan 4th quarter in 92, yeah

(I'm gonna do it)
No matter what your girlfriend said
(I'm gonna do it)
Believe me baby, talkin' 'bout the kinda change

(I'm gonna do it)
From a boy to a man, like Barrack and his plan
(I'm gonna do it)
If this is my last chance, yeah, yeah

Girl, the things I said, I can't believe it
But I swear to God I didn't mean it
But it takes a lot for me to admit I'm wrong, yeah
But I'll do whatever to save my home cause

I can't go back, back and forth, in and out, out the door
Don't wanna fuss and fight no more
Don't give a damn about the score
Cause I'm, I'm a different kinda man
I'm the kind that understands what I got inside my hands
So baby

If this is my last chance to love you
I'm gonna play it like a grown man ought to
If I only got one shot to win you
Then call me Jordan 4th quarter in 92, yeah

(I'm gonna do it)
No matter what your girlfriend said
(I'm gonna do it)
Believe me baby, talkin' 'bout the kinda change

(I'm gonna do it)
From a boy to a man, like Barrack and his plan
(I'm gonna do it)
If this is my last chance, yeah, yeah

Sometimes I try to front like it don't matter
If you leave or stay, like I can find better
But the truth be told I know that you're the one
Girl, it's plain to see that, I ain't nothin' without you

And it seems like every song on the radio is about you girl
So stay on home, where you belong
So I can try to make some right out this wrong, listen baby

If this your favorite song, turn your radio on
Play it for your man or your lady all day long
If this your favorite song, turn your radio on
Play it for your man or your lady all day long

If this your favorite song, turn your radio on
Play it for your man or your lady all day long
If this your favorite song, turn your radio on
Play it for your man or your lady all day long

If this is my last chance to love you
I'm gonna play it like a grown man ought to
If I only got one shot to win you
Then call me Jordan 4th quarter in 92, yeah

(I'm gonna do it)
No matter what your girlfriend said
(I'm gonna do it)
Believe me baby, talkin' 'bout the kinda change

(I'm gonna do it)
From a boy to a man, like Barrack and his plan
(I'm gonna do it)
If this is my last chance, yeah, yeah
