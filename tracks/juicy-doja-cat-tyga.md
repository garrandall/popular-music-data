She keep that booty booty, she keep that plump (Yeah yeah)
That natural beauty beauty, yeah, yeah
If you could see it from the front, wait till you see it from the back, back, back, back, back
(Wait till you see it from the...)
Back, back, yeah, back, back, back (Wait till you see it from the...)
Back, back, back, back, back (Wait till you see it from the...)
If you could see it from the front, wait till you see it from the back

He like the Doja and the Cat, yeah
He like it thicc, he like it fat, yeah
Like to keep him wanting more
He ask me, "Doja, where you at, huh?"
And all them niggas wanna know
How long it take to pull my pants up, mmh, mmh, mmh
Broke a fingernail and then some, mmh
Tryna squeeze into my True Religion denim, mmh, mmh, mmh
Sell it big, don't wanna sell you light (Yeah, I don't wanna sell it)
I don't buy it, where the cellulite?
He said the body unbelievable
Can't trust a big butt and a Gemini

I keep it juicy juicy, I eat that lunch (Yeah)
She keep that booty booty, she keep that plump (Yeah yeah)
That natural beauty beauty, yeah, yeah
If you could see it from the front, wait till you see it from the back, back, back, back, back
(Wait till you see it from the...)
Back, back, yeah, back, back, back (Wait till you see it from the...)
Back, back, yeah, back, back, back (Wait till you see it from the...)
If you could see it from the front, wait till you see it from the back

Bring that ass over, Doja, bring it back, back, back
I'm a big dog tryna eat the kitty cat, cat
I'ma slide in, the way it fit, I can tell we match
All about my racks, hella cheese, I don't fuck with rats
Big crib in Hollywood, I don't even act
Calm, relaxed, let a nigga tap, hit you on the app
Take a little, with the, wipe the pain away
Juicy and it's tighter than a virgin like Madonna say
I love when you give in, I love when you don't (Sometimes)
Hit me with the threesome and sometimes you won't (Sometimes)
You told me don't fuck with no bitches you know (Naw)
You got it, yeah, you got it, baby, bust it on the floor

I keep it juicy juicy, I eat that lunch (Yeah)
She keep that booty booty, she keep that plump (Yeah yeah)
That natural beauty beauty, yeah, yeah
If you could see it from the front, wait till you see it from the back, back, back, back, back
(Wait till you see it from the...)
Back, back, yeah, back, back, back (Wait till you see it from the...)
Back, back, yeah, back, back, back (Wait till you see it from the...)
If you could see it from the front, wait till you see it from the back

Yeah, he like it plump, he need that
Need the rump and need the thighs, he eat that
Eat that up, and in the night, he see that
In the dark, and in the ride he keep that
Keep it running, like it plump, he need that
Need the rump and need the thighs, he eat that
Eat that up and in the night, he see that
In the dark, and in the ride he keep that
Keep it running

I keep it juicy juicy, I eat that lunch (Yeah)
She keep that booty booty, she keep that plump (Yeah yeah)
That natural beauty beauty, yeah, yeah
If you could see it from the front, wait 'til you see it from the back, back, back, back, back
(Wait till you see it from the...)
Back, back, yeah, back, back, back (Wait till you see it from the...)
Back, back, yeah, back, back, back (Wait till you see it from the...)
If you could see it from the front, wait till you see it from the back
