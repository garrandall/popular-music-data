To you, to you, gonna give it to ya
To you, to you, gonna give it to

(I'm gonna give it to you)
(I'm gonna give it to you)

(2x)

(I'm gonna give it)
(I'm gonna give it)
(I'm gonna give it)
(This love)

(2x)


I've waited much too long, love's overdue
I've got one thing on my mind, that's me and you
Well, I must confess to you the way I feel
This love is just for you, now here's the deal


(This love)


Let's take it easy, let's not move too fast
My love is strong for you and built to last
Don't hesitate, I'm gonna show you how
Not holding back, because the time is now

Won't you take a seat
Hold on tight, enjoy the right
'Cause tonight is the night
You've got love on your side

I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna give it to you
(Whatever it is you want)

Come on
Yes I am, I'm gonna give it
I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna give it
I'm gonna give it
I'm gonna give it
I'm gonna give it
