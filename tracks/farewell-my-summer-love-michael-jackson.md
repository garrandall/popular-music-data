Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl I won't forget you, 
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh

I found my happiest days, 
When you came to see your grandma in may
I bumped into you by the corner store
I told you that you sure looked good, now

Your grandma's house was next to mine
We were together most of the time
But summer's gotten away from us
Time's moving too fast for us
(Bye, bye) 

Don't turn around
'Cause you might see me cry
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh, yeah

When you return to your hometown
And you discuss your trip
Will I be the guy that you put down
Or someone that you don't forget, no? 

I'll never forget you
And maybe next year
When you're out of school
You'll return, but until you do, baby
(Bye, bye) 

Don't turn around
You might see me cry
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, yeah

Farewell, farewell
Farewell, farewell

If you remember my name, 
(Drop a line) 
Drop a line sometime, yeah
Yeah, ooh
Girl I won't forget you
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl I won't forget you

When you return to your hometown
And you discuss your trip
Will I be the guy that you put down
Or someone that you don't forget, no? 

I'll never forget you
And maybe next year
When you're out of school
You'll return, but until you do, baby
(Bye, bye) 

Don't turn around
You might see me cry
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, oohh, yeah
Farewell, my summer love, farewell
