1-2-3-4
Come on, baby
Say you love me
5-6-7 times


They tell me you're shy boy
But I want you just the same
Don't play innocent with me
You know it's not just fun and games


When I look into your eyes
So much passion burns inside
But if you need some coaxing
I will do it
Step by step
There's nothing to it


1-2-3-4
Come on, baby
Say you love me
5-6-7 times
8-9-10-11
I'm just gonna keep on counting
Until you are mine


Come out of your shell, boy
You know we go like hand in glove
You're afraid of giving in
But I am never giving up on your love


And no matter what it takes
I will steal your heart away
Take a chance for once
You won't regret it
Want my love
Just come and get it


1-2-3-4
Come on, baby
Say you love me
5-6-7 times
8-9-10-11
I'm just gonna keep on counting
Until you are mine

So no matter what it takes
I will steal your heart away
Take a chance for once
You won't regret it
Take my love
Just come and get it


1-2-3-4
Come on, baby
Say you love me
5-6-7 times
8-9-10-11
I'm just gonna keep on counting
Until you are mine

1-2-3-4
Come on, baby
5-6-7 times
You got to give me your love
8-9-10-11
I'm just gonna keep on counting, baby
Until you are mine

1-2-3-4
5-6-7
8-9-10-11
