We got a message in our music
We got a message in our music
There's a message in my song
So hum along and sing along

We got a message in our music
We got a message in our music
There's a message in our song
So open your ears and listen here

'Cause we gonna talk about all the things
That's been goin' down
(Goin' down, goin' down)
Get your information
From this means of communication
(Communication)

We got, we got it, we got it, a message in our music
We got a message in our music
There's a message in our song
So understand while you dance

'Cause we're gonna talk about the situation
Of my nations over the world
(Nation, nation)
Try and make you see
Things ain't like they're supposed to be
(Supposed to be)

We got, we got it, we got it, a message in our music
We got a message in our music
There's a message in our song
So open your ears and listen here

We wanna look around
In our neighborhoods
(Neighborhoods, neighborhoods)
Get your information
From this means of communication
(Communication)

Well, well

So hum along and sing along
Sing, sing, sing, y?all, like y?all wanna
Don't y'all wanna

'Cause we got the, we got the
(Message in our music)
Got it, we got it
(Message in our music)

Dig it, y'all, dig it
(Message in our music)
Get it, go get it
(Message in our music)

Open your ears and listen here
And hum along and sing a song
Understand while you dance
Come on, y'all

Clap your hands, clap your hands
Woo, woo, woo
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Woo, woo, woo

Clap your hands, clap your hands
Woo, woo, woo
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Woo, woo, woo
