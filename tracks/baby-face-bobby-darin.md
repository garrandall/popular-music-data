Baby face

You've got the cutest little baby face
There ain't nobody can evah take your place
Ah, you baby face
My poor heart's jumpin'
Ah... you started somethin'

Baby face
Well, I'm in heaven when I'm in your
Your fond embrace
Yeah... I didn't need no shove
Cuz I just fell... I fell in love

With your pretty, pretty baby face

Ah, let's twist awhile

Ah... baby face

You know you got the cutest baby face
They'll never be nobody to take your place
You baby face
You got my two knees knockin'
You ain't the girl with a hole in your stockin'

But you're baby face
I'm in heaven when I'm in your

Fond embrace
Yeah... I never need no shove
Cuz I just fell in love

With your pretty, pretty, pretty baby face

Ah...
