How I live for the moments
Where I'm still in Your presence
All the noise dies down
Lord, speak to me now
You have all my attention
I will linger and listen
I can't miss a thing


Lord, I know my heart wants more of You
My heart wants something new
So I surrender all


All I want is to live within Your love
Be undone by who You are
My desire is to know You deeper
Lord, I will open up again
Throw my fears into the wind
I am desperate for a touch of heaven




You're the fire in the morning
You're the cool in the evening
The breath in my soul
Oh, the life in my bones
There is no hesitation
In Your love and affection
It's the sweetest of all


Lord, I know my heart wants more of You
My heart wants something new
So I surrender all


All I want is to live within Your love
Be undone by who You are
My desire is to know You deeper
Lord, I will open up again
Throw my fears into the wind
I am desperate for a touch of heaven




I'll open up my heart to You
I'll open up my heart to You now
So do what only You can
Jesus, have Your way in me now
I'll open up my heart to You
I'll open up my heart to You now
So do what only You can
Jesus, have Your way in me now
I'll open up my heart to You
I'll open up my heart to You now
So do what only You can
Jesus, have Your way in me now




All I want is to live within Your love
Be undone by who You are
My desire is to know You deeper
Lord, I will open up again
Throw my fears into the wind
I am desperate for a touch of heaven




All I want is to live within Your love
Be undone by who You are
My desire is to know You deeper
Lord, I will open up again
Throw my fears into the wind
I am desperate for a touch of heaven
