Sweet talkin' guy
Talkin' sweet kinda lies
Don't you believe in him
If you do
He'll make you cry
He'll send you flowers
And paint the town with another girl
He's a sweet talkin'
But he's my kinda guy

Sweeter than sugar
Kisses like wine
Oh, he's so fine
Don't let him under your skin
'Cause you'll never win
No, you never win
Don't give him love today
Tomorrow he's on his way
He's a sweet talkin' guy
But he's my kinda guy

Why do I love him like I do

He's a sweet talkin' guy
Stay away from him
Don't believe him he's lying
No no no, you'll never win
You'll just end up crying
Don't give him love today
Tomorrow he's on his way
He's a sweet talkin' guy
Stay away from him
No no no, you'll never win
