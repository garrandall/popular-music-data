Fahoo fores dahoo dores
Welcome Christmas come this way
Fahoo fores dahoo dores
Welcome Christmas, Christmas day
Welcome, welcome fahoo ramus
Welcome, welcome dahoo damus
Christmas day is in our grasp
So long as we have hands to clasp
Fahoo fores dahoo dores
Welcome Christmas bring your cheer
Fahoo fores dahoo dores
Welcome all who's far and near
Welcome Christmas, fahoo ramus
Welcome Christmas, dahoo damus
Christmastime will always be
Just as long as we have glee
Fahoo fores dahoo dores
Welcome Christmas bring your light
Oooooooooo...
