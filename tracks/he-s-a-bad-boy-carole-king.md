HE'S A BAD BOY
WRITERS GERRY GOFFIN, CAROLE KING
Copyright 1963

Mama doesn't like him 'cause he never cuts his hair
Daddy doesn't like him 'cause he says he heard him swear
He's a bad boy
But I don't care
He's not happy working, he's got no use for school
Never feels the least bit sorry when he treats me cruel
He's a bad boy
But I'm a fool
Don't it kinda break your heart now, don't it make you sad
When the boy you love so much turns out to be so bad
He's a bad boy
A bad boy, oh yeah
Don't it kinda break your heart now, don't it make you sad
When the boy you love so much turns out to be so bad
He's a bad boy
He's a bad boy
He's a bad boy
Oh yeah
