They're rotting my brain, love
These hoes are the same


I admit it, another ho got me finished
Broke my heart, oh no you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'ma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth, can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman, tell me she from Colorado
And she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'?
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in, I don't fit in
Tell me what's the secret to love, I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today and she grinnin'


Hey, these girls are insane (Lil Boat)


Shoutout Megan, make a nigga cum in two seconds
It was all good til' no one wanted see me with it
Janet, shawty hair from a different planet
Cool as fuck but I can't trust a soul, God damn it
Jasmine, probably taking pictures out in Aspen
High school, back in high school, she couldn't stand me
These girls are the same
That's why I fuck 'em all the same, my brother
Drop my top in the rain (skr)
No one feels my pain but my brothers
VVS my veins
Ice cold blood can't relate to no lover
Please don't go insane
Over these raggedy hoes, my brother
Hundred thousand dollars on a rain coat
Niggas steady hatin', call them Big Joe
30 karats hangin' off my pinky toe
Asking all them questions, why you wanna know?
Shawty wanted drugs so I made it snow
Walking around askin' folks where the blow (Lil Boat)


Now I am insane
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain love
Cause all these girls the same, love
Now I am insane (oh, no)
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain love
Cause all these girls the same, love


The same, love
All these hoes the same, love
