I want seven minutes in heaven
Give me up 'til eleven
Remember who you met
When you were in your dreams

Papa, come on
And be a trouper, trouper
Papa, come on
Don't be a party pooper
Oh, won't you say it's alright then..
To lower the lights 'cause
I want seven minutes in heaven
Give me up 'til eleven
Remember who you met
When you were in your dreams!

Seven minutes ain't much
No, no
And I love him so much
Yeah, yeah

Seven minutes ain't much
No, no
And I love him so much
Yeah, yeah
