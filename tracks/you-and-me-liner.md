You and me
Could easily be mmm together endlessly
We'll be in love
We could find such a perfect state of mind
That to leave would be unkind
We'll be in love, love

Do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do

If your heart is strong
Then we can't go wrong
Oh baby can't you see?
If your heart is strong
Then we can't go wrong
Oh baby you and me

Wait and see
Said it's just like one, two, three
Mmm in perfect harmony

If your heart is strong
Then we can't go wrong
Oh baby can't you see?
If your heart is strong
Then we can't go wrong
Oh baby you and me

Do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do

Oh, you and me
Said we could easily be mmm together endlessly

If your heart is strong
Then we can't go wrong
Oh baby can't you see?
If your heart is strong
Then we can't go wrong
Oh baby you and me.
