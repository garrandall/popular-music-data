Where have the numbers gone
That marched across my bed
The faces after faces
Still inside my head

No words of love
The hollow sound
Of hungry people in the night
(Hungry people in the night)
Do not say it was wrong or right
(Not say it was wrong or right)

But call it flight (fly away)
Oh, can Heaven tell me
Where they are now
They could fill cathedrals

Where are they now
They're in the dance halls
They're in the diners
They're in the streets

Where are they now
At the movies
They're in the bar rooms

Where are they now
They're in the dance halls
They're in the diners
They're in the streets

Where are they now
At the movies
They're in the bar rooms

They could fill cathedrals
(Cathedrals)
They could fill cathedrals, baby
(Cathedrals)

Each one is kind of special
As the music played
And so I'd end up leaving
When I should have stayed

Away from this
And all too fast
Another lover hits the dust
(Another lover hits the dust)
So much for all the time and trust
(So much for all the time and trust)

From love to lust
And back to love
Oh, can Heaven tell me
Where they are now
They could fill cathedrals

Where are they now
They're in the dance halls
They're in the diners
They're in the streets

Where are they now
They're at the movies
They're in the bar rooms

Where are they now
They're in the dance halls
They're in the diners
They're in the streets

Where are they now
They're at the movies
They're in the bar rooms

Oh, they could fill cathedrals
(Cathedrals)
Oh, they could fill cathedrals, baby
(Cathedrals)
Oh, they could fill cathedrals
(Cathedrals)
