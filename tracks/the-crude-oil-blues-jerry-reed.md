Well, now listen people let me tell you some news
I'll sing a song called the crude oil blues
We're low on heat and all, we're low on gas
And I'm so cold I'm about to freeze myself

We got the crude oil blues
'Gon the winter time sure gettin' cold
To the bottom of my shoes

Well, my hands are shakin' and my knees are weak
But it ain't because of love, it's from lack of heat
I've got the crude oil blues

I'm gonna tell you a story about this drunk I knew
He kept his basement full of homemade brew
But the winter got so bad it screwed up the boy's thinkin'
He got so cold he had to burn all his drinkin'

He's got the crude oil blues
He said the wintertime can sure get cold
To the bottom of your shoes

He said, burnin' this booze just destroys my soul
But there's one thing about it honey
When you're cold, you're cold
I've got the crude oil blues

Hope I got somethin' to
Generate a little heat
Alright, all you kids out there

Well, when we made this record
There was a little bit of doubt
Whether or not the thing
Was ever gonna come out

I said, "Hey chief, you reckon this record will be released?"
He said, "Son, we ain't got enough oil
To keep the presses greased"
We got the crude oil blues

And son, if we can't make records then we don't need you
I said, "What am I gonna do if I can't sing and pick?"
He said, "Well, just keep yourself warm playin' all them hot licks"
We've got the crude oil blues

Oh Mama, don't forget to bring in the brass monkey
And remember what Albert Weinstein said
That coolin' is conducive to cuddlin'

Honey, I love ya but pass the duck down
Hey, I read a sign on the pump at my
Favorite gas station the yesterday
It said uh, 'He who expecteth nothin' ain't gonna be deceived'
