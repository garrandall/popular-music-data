Ha ha, hoo hoo, thought you'd get the money too
Greedy motherfuckers try to have your cake and eat it too


Sharp shooter into breaking hearts
A baby gigolo, a sex pistol
Hollering at everything that walks
No substance just small talk
Know why you feeling on that girl's behind
You gotta sleazy one track mind
Working your work until you think you find
Who's going home with you tonight


I changed all the credit cards
And switched the lock to all my doors
You thought my heart would be destroyed
Look around cause I'm chillling boy
Whatcha go and get your lawyers for
I, makes my dough in just one show, you know
Your lawyer shoulda let you know, you know
When you sue me, you gonna be broke you know
Ain't know you way you could bring me down
Any chick that you stick is real sleazy
Before I need you, I betcha gon' need me
You ain't want me anyway way, you wanted to be me
What made you think I'd keep you around
While I, work my ass off and you just lounge
You slump, bump, son of a gun
And a, how much your worth
I think negative Don


Oh who you give it to
Who you gonna steal it from
Who's your next victim
Oh who you gonna lie to
Who you gonna cheat on
Who you gonna leave alone
Oh what you gonna tell her
After she discovers you don't really love her
Oh gonna be a showdown, knock down drag out
Gunslinger shoot 'em up


I betcha think this song is about you
I betcha think this song is about you
I betcha think this song is about you
I betcha think this song is about you
Don't you, don't you
Don't you, don't you


They call me "Diddy"
(It wasn't me!) Whatchu talkin' 'bout lawyers for?
(It wasn't me!) Why you wanna change locks and doors?
(It wasn't me!) Well, maybe it was, sure
But you know tomorrow, you'll love me some more
I'm back, another Visa, another set of keys
We did this last week Ma, don't get ammnesia (Remember?)
All this back and forth gotta quit
And by the way, THIS IS THE REMIX!


Sweatin me but I'm not your type
You think you irk me and you're so right
I'd rather keep the trash and throw you out
Stupid bitch in my beach house
Naw I ain't gone go and act a fool
And be lead story on the nigga news
Not me sucker, I'll never be your lover
I'm gonna make you suffer
You stupid mutherfucker


You musta thought you had game like nigga what
Walk around like you down, you don't give a fuck
Cause you don't really want beef until you hit the streets
See I ma lover, not a fighter but I'll crack your teeth
Boy plea plea nah don't bother me
Cause when you had me, you ain't know how to chill with me
But now you up on dem knees, still jocking me
But I ma say it real real, keep it real
What the deal, how you feel, is it ill, is it sick
Cause I'm the deal, still here with appeal and it's real
Don't front cause boy I the shit
I'm doing better with out you, playa
And I'm happy without you, playa
And this song is about you, playa
Muthafuckin' son of a gun


Gotta chip upon your shoulder
I just knocked it off
Show me what you gonna do
I ain't bout to run
You have just run out of ammunition
Shooting blanks now, you son of a gun
