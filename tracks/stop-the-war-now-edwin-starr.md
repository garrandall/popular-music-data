Alright, yeah
Make the sound of peace sing out
(Stop the war, now)
Everybody, don’t put if off another day
Make your voices roar


(Stop the war, now)
Just like thunder y’all
Don’t put it off another day
Sing a song now
(Stop the war, now)
Listen to me, y'all
(Don’t put it off) another day
Listen to me


A knock on the door, there's a letter from the war
Saying, "Greetings, we want you"
If I refuse to fight they say that that ain’t right
And time you'll have to do
Somebody please tell me what is war all about?
And why must I kill against my will?
I just can’t figure it out
Ow!


(Stop the war, now)
Good God, hear me say
Don’t put it off another day
Everybody sing
Stop the war, now, now, now, now
Don’t put it off another day
All we got to do is, listen
(Give peace a chance)
Aww, don’t throw another life away


Listen to me now
Think about all the soldiers
That are dead and gone today
If you’d ask them to fight again
What do you think they’d say?
I’m not trying to be funny
Just trying to get my point across
War is world's enemy #1
It’s that time that we called it off


Stop the war, now
Good god, hear me say
Don’t put it off another day
Everybody’s singing
Stop the war, now
Don’t put it off another day


All we got to do is, Lord
Give peace a chance
Don’t, don’t throw another life away


Casualties pile up each day
Cemeteries are overflowing
Leaders of the world (?)
But the death list keeps right on growin'
And what does a mother get in return
For the life of the son she’s lost?
A few measly pennies a month
A medal, a babe, and a doggone cost


Stop the war now
Good God, hear me say
Don’t put it off another day
Everybody sing
Stop the war, now
Don’t put it off another day


Why can’t we just (Give peace a chance)
Please!
Don’t throw another life away
Can’t you see?
Enough blood has been shed by the wounded and the dead
Enough blood has been shed by the wounded and the dead
Ow!
Enough blood has been shed by the wounded and the dead
Ow!


Listen!
Stop the war, now
Good God, everybody
Don’t put it off another day


This is a message to the leaders of the world
(Give peace a chance)
Aww!
