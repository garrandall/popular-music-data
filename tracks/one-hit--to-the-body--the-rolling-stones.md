You fell out of the clear blue sky
To the darkness below
The smell of your flesh excites me
Blood starts to flow, so help me God
You burst in in a blaze of light
You unzippered the dark
One kiss took my breath away
One look lights up the stars


And it's, it's one hit to the body
It comes straight from your heart
(Straight from the heart)
One hit to the body
Sure went straight to the mark
So help me God


One more from the body
One more straight from your heart yeah


It's one shot when you love me
One shot when you leave me
I don't need no security
I just need some peace


And it's one hit to the body
It comes straight from the heart
(Straight from the heart)
One voice calls out my name
It sure went straight to the mark
(Straight from the heart)


One punch and you knocked me down
Tore my defenses apart
One round took me out of the game
You did me some permanent harm


It took just one hit
It took just one hit
It isn't enough for me
It isn't enough for me
(Enough for me)
It isn't enough for me
It's hurting me, baby
Oh your love is a sweet addiction
I can't clean you out of my veins
It's a life long affliction
That has damaged my brain


It took just one hit to the body
To tear my defences apart
(Straight from the heart)
One hit to the body
Sure went straight to the mark
(Straight from the heart)
One hit to the body
And it comes straight from the heart
(Straight from the heart)
One hit to the body, to the body, to the body
Come straight from the heart


One more from the body
One more straight from the heart
Straight from the heart
One more from the body
One more straight from the heart
Straight from the heart
That's all it took, that's all it took
Because one hit straight form the heart
So help me, so help me, so help me God
So help me, so help me, so help me now
One more from the body
One more straight from the heart
One more, one more from the body
And it comes straight from the heart
