I werent born on new park road, but I was raised on new park road, first place that I sold that dope first place that a man put his hands on smoke
English one or the russian one but man pulled up in a german one
2 44's in a 4 door truck there's one on the right on the left there's one
We don't wait for the paigons to come for beef we slide round there and we fry that beef
When I smile you see the shine on my white gold teeth
I used to lift 2 doors from doggy and liquez, mana smile see the shine on my white gold teeth
We slide round there and fry that beef we don't wait for the paingons to come for beef


Ight single glazing project living we made us a killing were poverty drivin
We talk about knifings and talk about drillings bro got life for a one shot killing
Took dat as a blessin we handle our beef got the opdems stressing
Everywhere we go man know mans face but on new park road mans legends
Blew smoke on the road for my friend blew smoke on the road for my family
Hear man talkin bout this and that till I come round causing a causality
See bare new faces around man flexin and screaming out gang with me
I separate the reals from the fakes just know that the real ones ran with me


I was raised on new park road
Went school on new park road
Made money on new park road
New park yea that's my home, miss bros like slows and o's bare knife work nuff gun smoke
That's not just all I know your get booked and we sold out shows
Come sing with bros n we soon gown blow and since I've gone up I ain't never been low, I've been through good times I've been through bad times I've really seen it all on new park road
Free incy yea that's my bro huh if you know then you know
R.I.P ziggy yea that's my bro from new park road




Clutch it to clean better mind where your stepping
Home of the braves and the legends
With a style of a line with a gun on my back that will take of heads in a second
No teckers better check it
Better know dem boys before you step in
Cause his mum ain't home and his dad that's the sound that's the sound of a weapon
No stressing life and aggression
And a girl that I can't really mention
If you know my face then you know my face I came in c's with a blessing
But I came out side for attention
7 days for the cure and I'm flexin
Got a girl with a body that will kill anybody if your tryin to disrespect my section


You might see me in a cutru in a cutru you don't like me fuck you
Don't chat shit when I buck you your probably still pissed about the time that I robbed you
What you except me to do?
My don gave me the dropped and you turned out to be the move
I don't mind if I beef with you
You my hands never empty when time I need to move
Woke up this morning looked in the fridge and I didn't see nothing
Now I'm hungry broke and I'm pissed
Got to get my money on my crud ting
Bad b said that mans got bits I said talk to me darlin you might know a man there's beef in the six make man more wanna rob him


I've got a dope face
I can move dope main
I know there gunna hate
Money from cocaine
100 and loads came bro main
How can you hate on a nigga grime when you got it from sitting down
You come from the picker ground I got lost niggas sitting down
For a flippin pound tryin to get in style
Just a little child and hes bigger now just a nigga now father vigor down
You a hoodie to you never need the food but I can lean on you what ever needed you such a scenic view, and I'm buzzin B  new park
