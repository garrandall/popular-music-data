Spent forty-eight dollars last night at the county fair
I threw out my shoulder but I won her that teddy bear
She's got me sayin' sugar-pie, honey, darlin', and dear
I ain't seen the Braves play a game all year
I'm gonna get fired if I don't get some sleep
My long lost buddies say I'm gettin' in too deep


But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it


My Mama and Daddy tried to teach me courtesy
But it never sank in 'til that girl got a hold of me
Now I'm holdin' umbrellas and openin' up doors
I'm takin' out the trash and I'm sweepin' my floors
I'm crossin' my fingers and countin' every kiss
Prayin' that it keeps goin' on like this


'Cause I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it


Gotta wash my truck and dress up
To pick her up to watch TV
And she sits down on the sofa, she'll move a little closer
She can't get enough of me


Yeah, I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it


Come on, baby
You know what I like
Yeah, I like that
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Hey, don't forget to turn out the lights
