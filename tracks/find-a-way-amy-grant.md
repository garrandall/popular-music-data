You tell me your friends are distant
You tell me your man's untrue
You tell me that you've been walked on
And how you feel abused

So you stand here an angry young woman
Taking all the pain to heart
I hear you saying that you want to see changes
But you don't know how to start

Love will find a way
(How do you know?)
Love will find a way
(How can you see?)
I know it's hard to see
The past and still believe
Love is gonna find a way
I know that love will find a way
(A way to go)
Love can make a way
(Only love can know)
Leave behind the doubt
Love's the only out
Love will surely find a way

I know this life is a strange thing
I can't answer all the whys
Tragedy always finds me
Taken again by surprise

I could stand here an angry young woman
Taking all the pain to heart
But I know that love can bring changes
And so we've got to move on

Love will find a way
(How do you know?)
Love will find a way
(How can you see?)
I know it's hard to see
The past and still believe
Love is gonna find a way
I know that love will find a way
(A way to go)
Love can make a way
(Only love can know)
Leave behind the doubt
Love's the only out
Love will surely find a way

If our God His Son not sparing
Came to rescue you
Is there any circumstance
That He can't see you through?

Love will find a way
(How do you know?)
Love will find a way
(How can you see?)
I know it's hard to see
The past and still believe
Love is gonna find a way
I know that love will find a way
(A way to go)
Love can make a way
(Only love can know)
Leave behind the doubt
Love's the only out
Love will surely find a way
