...Mm hm

I can see it in your eyes
And feel it in your touch
I know that you're scared
But you've never been this loved (mm hm)

It's a long shot, baby,
I know it's true.
But if anyone can make it,
I'm bettin' on me and you. (mm hm)

Just keep on moving into me,
I know you're gonna see
The best is yet to come

And don't fear it now,
We're going all the way.
That sun is shining on a brand new day.
It's a long way down
And it's a leap of faith
But we're never giving up
Cuz I know we've got a once in a lifetime love

Everybody's looking
For what we've found
Some wait their whole life
And it never comes around. (uu huhh)

So don't hold back now.
Just let go of all you've ever known
You can put your hand in mine.

And don't fear it now,
We're going all the way.
That sun is shining on a brand new day.
It's a long way down
And it's a leap of faith
But we're never giving up
Cuz I know we've got a once in a lifetime love

I close my eyes and I see you standing right there
Sayin 'i do' and they're throwing the rice in our hair.
Well the first one's born
And a brother comes along,
And he's got your smile.
I've been looking back on the life we had
I'm still by your side.

So don't fear it now,
We're going all the way.
That sun is shining on a brand new day.
It's a long way down
And it's a leap of faith
But I'm never givin up
Cuz I know we've got a once in a lifetime love.
