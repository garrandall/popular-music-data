It's just an old beat up truck
Some say that I should trade up
Now that I got some jangle in my pocket
But what they don’t understand
Is it's the miles that make a man
I wouldn’t trade that thing in for a rocket
What they don’t know is my dad and me–
We drove her out to Tennessee
And she’s still here and now he’s gone
So I hold on


It's just an old beat up box
Its rusty strings across the top
It probably don’t look like much to you
But these dents and scratches in the wood
Yeah, that’s what makes it sound so good
To me it's better than brand new
You see this here flat top guitar
Has had my back in a million bars
Singing every country song
So I hold on


To the things I believe in
My faith, your love, our freedom
To the things I can count on
To keep me going strong
Yeah, I hold on, I hold on
Like the stripes to the flag
Like a boy to his dad
I can't change who I am, right or wrong
So I hold on


Yeah, baby, looking at you right now
There ain't never been no doubt
Without you I'd be nothing
So if you ever worry about
Me walking out
Yeah, let me tell you something
I hold on
I hold on
Can you hear me, baby?
I hold on
Yeah
I hold on…


To the things I believe in
My faith, your love, our freedom
To the things I can count on
To keep me going strong
Yeah, I hold on, I hold on
Like the stripes to the flag
Like a boy to his dad
I can't change who I am, right or wrong
So I hold on
