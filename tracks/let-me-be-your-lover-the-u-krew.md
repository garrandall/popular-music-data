The first time I saw you,
You Look so sweet
I Lost my breath, sweat
And got my heart skip the beat
I can't believe my eyes
Are so fine
I knew right there and there
I have to make girl mine

But when I'd tried to talk to her
She never look my way
I'd Start falling down?
And all the words that she say
I know I get in love so wisdom help

With every?
To make you see
You belong right here next to me
Any
Will be practic for each other
It just one thing I need to know
And I'll be your lover


Let Me Be Your Lover
And I'll gave you love
Let Me Be Your Lover
And I'll bring you love
Let Me Be Your Lover
And I'll gave you love
Let Me Be Your Lover
And I'll bring you love

I Don't like playing games
Or Wasting my time
But, I'd can't sleep at night
'Cause she's on my mind
Tried to cover with a?
To make u fall in love
And want me for your man

With every
To make you see
You belong right here next to me
Any
Will be practic for each other
It just one thing I need to know
And I'll be your lover



Let Me Be Your Lover
And I'll gave you love
Let Me Be Your Lover
And I'll bring you love
Let Me Be Your Lover
And I'll gave you love
Let Me Be Your Lover
And I'll bring you love

You I needed
You know I wanted

You I needed
You know I wanted
Girl...
Let Me Be... Your Lover
