You better watch what you say
You better watch what you do to me
Don't get carried away
Girl, if you can do better than me, go
Yeah go, but remember

Good love is hard to find
Good love is hard to find
You got lucky babe
You got lucky babe
When I found you

You put a hand on my cheek
And then you turn your eyes away
If you don't feel complete
If I don't take you all of the way, then go
Yeah go, but remember

Good love is hard to find
Good love is hard to find
You got lucky babe
You got lucky babe
When I found you

Yeah go, just go, but remember

Good love is hard to find
Good love is hard to find
You got lucky babe
You got lucky babe
I found you
