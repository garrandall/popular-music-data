Whoa, huh, whoa, huh, hey
Whoa, huh, whoa, huh, hey
Whoa, huh, whoa, huh, hey
Whoa, huh, whoa, huh, hey

Do your dance, to the rhythm
On the floor, we're just havin' fun
Well, do your dance, to the rhythm
On the floor, we're just havin' fun, well hey

We gon' start at midnight, party till the mornin' light
You see, we can't give up or stop until we get it right
Ain't that right, ain't that right, woo

Do your dance, to the rhythm
On the floor, we're just havin' fun
Come on, people, do your dance, to the rhythm
On the floor, we're just havin' fun

Well, there's a message for your body in this song
Well can't you feel it, it's tellin' you, "Let's get it on"?
So let's get it on, get on up, give it up

Good music makes you feel like dancin'
Don't it make you feel good
Don't it make you wanna get down
Good music
Shake it up, shake it 'round

Well, I want everybody to get an attitude
Come on, people, right till it feels good
Put your hand on your hip
And get into this groove

Do your dance, to the rhythm
On the floor, we're just havin' fun
Do your dance, to the rhythm
On the floor, we're just havin' fun

Do your dance, to the rhythm
On the floor, we're just havin' fun
Do your dance, to the rhythm
On the floor, we're just havin' fun

Good music makes you feel like dancin'
Don't it make you feel good
Don't it make you wanna get down
Good music
Do your dance, do your dance

Do your dance, to the rhythm
On the floor, we're just havin' fun
Do your dance to the rhythm
On the floor, we're just havin' fun

Do your dance, to the rhythm
On the floor, we're just havin' fun
Do your dance, to the rhythm
On the floor we're just havin' fun

Do your dance, do your dance
Do your dance, do your dance
