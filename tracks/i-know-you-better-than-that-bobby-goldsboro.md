Little girl, I hate to say this but I've got to
I know you'll cry and I don't mean to hurt you
But I found someone new 
Who stole my heart from you
And little girl, I just don't love you anymore

You ran around on me but I was true to you
You thought you had me wrapped around your finger and it was true
But those days are all gone by
Another little girl has caught my eye
And little girl, I just don't love you anymore

Little girl, I tried so hard to make you love me
But you just never seemed to care
Well, now I found a new love
Who loves me more than you love
And when she calls, I'm gonna be there

Well, little girl I've said it, so I'll leave you
I thought it better to tell you than to deceive you
You'll find another guy someday
You never really loved me anyway
And little girl, I just don't love you anymore, anymore
I just don't love you anymore, anymore
I just don't love you anymore
