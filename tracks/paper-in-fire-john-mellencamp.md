She had a dream
And boy, it was a good one
So she chased after her dream
With much desire

But when she got too close
To her expectations
Well, the dream burned up
Like paper in fire

Paper in fire
Stinkin' up the ashtrays
Paper in fire
Smokin' up the alleyways
Who's to say the way
A man should spend his days
Do you let them smolder
Like paper in fire?

He wanted love
With no involvement
So he chased the wind
That's all his silly life required

And the days of vanity
Went on forever
And he saw his days burn up
Like paper in fire

Paper in fire
Stinkin' up the ashtrays
Paper in fire
Smokin' up the alleyways
Who's to say the way
A man should spend his days
Do you let them smolder
Like paper in fire?

There's a good life
Right across this green field
And each generation
Stares at it from afar

But we keep no check
On our appetites
So the green fields turn to brown
Like paper in fire

Paper in fire
Stinkin' up the ashtrays
Paper in fire
Throwin' down the alleyways
Who's to say the way
A man should spend his days
Do you let them smolder
Like paper in fire?

Paper in fire
Stinkin' up the ashtrays
Paper in fire
Throwin' down the alleyways
Who's to say the way
A man should spend his days
Do you let them smolder
Like paper in fire?

Paper in fire
