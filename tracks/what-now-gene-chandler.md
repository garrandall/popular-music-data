What now after you've done me like you did
Already out stringing along like an infatuated kid
You always do me wrong with no explanation
There's never any love nor conversation
So after holding in my fear
And fighting off my tears
What now, what now

I've tried making my life complete with you
But it seems there's no value toward people true to you
I cried to you, I can't take it too much longer
But every hurt and bit of dirt makes you stronger
So after holding in my fear
And fighting off my tears
What now, what now

Because so very loud
In front of all the crowd
Don't know from day to day
What now, what now, what now
So after holding in my fear
And fighting off my tears
What now, what now
