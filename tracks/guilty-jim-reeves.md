I've been accused, convicted and condemned
The trial's over, and now I face the end,
Is this your way of telling me we're through
When all I'm guilty of, is loving you.

You were the judge, the jury all in one
You found me guilty and now my term's begun.
I must confess, I've never been untrue
And all I'm guilty of, is loving you.

Loving you, and now I'm losing you
Losing you, for things I didn't do.

Please let your heart, consider an appeal
For now you know, exactly how I feel.
Don't punish me for things I didn't do
When all I'm guilty of, is loving you.

Yes, all I'm guilty of, is loving you...
