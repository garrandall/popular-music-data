I apologize I don't recollect your name
(Oh, baby I don't know your name)
But lemme tell you that them heels really compliment your frame
(Look at your body baby)
Girl lemme get them ohaahs then I gotta catch my plane
Say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time
Girl how could we get that way?


Look, another day another dollar
She hate me when I leave cause when I leave I never call her
That's life shit, alright, shit, I could call you right quick
But if I call you gone be like "Boo why we haven't skyped yet? "
And I skype, bet you say "Lay where my flight at"
If I decline then you inquire on where I spend my nights at
Shit this life gets overwhelming and more then hectic
But a woman worth some anger is certainly worth some effort
Just look closer my life is quite deceptive
Women'll sell they soul just to buy some attention
I need something to hold fuck that passive aggression
And when I'm back from off that road don't ask me no questions
Please... fear watchu don't know


I apologize I don't recollect your name
But lemme tell you that them heels really compliment your frame
Girl lemme get them ohaahs then I gotta catch my plane
Say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time
Girl how could we get that way?


Don't remember how I met her but I know I won't forget her
If loving her is wrong then I just know I won't see heaven
She say she from Seattle, she twenty and some change
Before I get to T.I.A. I'm sure to make her rain
Then I'm back up on my plane Chi town over here
We spend some time and get some wine have some milds from Harolds
I told her this here's overrated but I love your city baby
Gotta get back to the D you know we finally famous
Driver drop me off in dallas I'm headed to some money
TSA be laughing all them rubbers in your luggage
I know I'm a always leave em but I swear I'll always love em
Tell her you'll probably find someone but you'll never find another


I apologize I don't recollect your name
But lemme tell you that them heels really compliment your frame
Girl lemme get them ohaahs then I gotta catch my plane
Say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time
Girl how could we get that way?


Got on my suede shoes, I'm in a great mood
That baggage claim awaiting miss thang outta St. Louis
Know she shining bright, got on my cartier, she my billie jean we minaj with mary jane
See we city hop, Vegas to LA, brings alotta joy Buggati boy that's Laina Lane
Our faucets used to drip, I used to ride the bench, but it was written in cursive for this king to exist
Packed her bags now she live amongst entrepreneurs
Marc Jacob the makeup Gi-Givenchy consumer Gianni Versace connoisseur a carnivore
Accountable for half a million uncounted for


I apologize I don't recollect your name
But lemme tell you that them heels really complement your frame
Girl lemme get them ohaahs then I gotta catch my plane
Say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time girl how could we get that way?
