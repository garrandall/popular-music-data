What is the price of happiness?
How can I find me love?
Where could I sell my heartache?
And what do I pay for love?

Where could I get me a good night's sleep
To trade off my trouble and pain?
How long does it take to realize
That love is a priceless thing?

Oh, I know you can't buy love
If you're rich with diamond and gold
But heartaches will come around freely
And knock on anybody's door

What is the price of happiness?
How can I find me love?
Where could I sell my heartaches?
And what do I pay for love?

I know you can't buy love
If you're rich with diamond and gold
But heartaches will come around freely
And knock on everybody's door

I know you can't buy love
If you're rich with diamond and gold
But heartaches will come around freely
And knock on anybody's door

What is the price of happiness?
How can I find me love?
Where could I sell my heartaches?
And what do I pay for love?

What do I pay for love?
A what do I pay for love?
A what do I pay for love?
