Time's not sleeping and time won't lose
You can't win 'cause time can't lose
So stop (so stop) what you're doin'
Start on something new
Don't (no don't) don't be hypnotized
Don't start thinkin' with your eyes

(I don't know) Why you mean that much to me
(You don't know) What it feels like lovin' you
(We all know) A change is good for you
(That's all right) Gotta do what you gotta do
Anyway

All I want is a place in your heart to fall into
All I need is someone to love
And tonight it's you, tonight it's you

Time's not sleeping and time won't lose
You can't win 'cause time can't lose
So stop (so stop) what you're doin'
Start on something new
Don't (no don't) don't be hypnotized
Don't start thinkin' with your eyes

(I don't know) Why you mean that much to me
(You don't know) What it feels like lovin' you
(We all know) A change is good for you
(That's all right) Gotta do what you gotta do
Anyway

All I want is a place in your heart to fall into
All I need is someone to love
And tonight it's you, tonight it's you

Come to my world
Come away with me
Smile with your eyes
So I can see

(I don't know) Why you mean that much to me
(You don't know) What it feels like lovin' you
(We all know) A change is good for you
(That's all right) Gotta do what you gotta do
Anyway

All I want is a place in your heart to fall into
All I need is someone to love
And tonight it's you, tonight it's you
Tonight it's you

All I want is a place in your heart to fall into
All I need is someone to love
And tonight it's you, tonight it's you
Tonight it's you, tonight's it's you
