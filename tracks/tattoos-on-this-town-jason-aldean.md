There's still black marks on that county road,
Where we drag raced our pick-ups and Mustangs
And weathered all the sun and rain.
And to this day up on that overpass,
Even underneath the new paint, you can still see
"Allie, will you marry me?"

Take a ride, look around
There ain't no doubt

It sure left its mark on us, we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here with everything we did
We laid a lot of memories down, like tattoos on this town

There's still a rope burn on that old branch, that hangs over the river.
I still got the scar
From swinging out a little too far.
There ain't a corner of this hallow ground,
That we ain't laughed or cried on.
It's where we loved, lived and learned real life stuff.
It's everything we're made of.

It sure left its mark on us, we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here with everything we did
We laid a lot of memories down, like tattoos on this town
Like tattoos on this town.

Everywhere, there we are,
It hits me right in my heart.

It sure left its mark on us, we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here with everything we did
We laid a lot of memories down,
And we'll always be hangin' around,
Like tattoos on this town
Like tattoos on this town
