Let me get that intro
Blunts, gators
Hand me my mink

On the East duckin' Feds from a peephole
1989, gangbangin' was at it's peak
This the beat that make me reminisce on G-Funk
Three summers before The Chronic hit the streets
I would rather slang hand to hand to a fiend
Rappin' on the side, trappin' was priority
But every now and then I go scoop my little thing
Pull up in my emcee bangin' New Jack Swing
Ooh, summertime time back in Long Beach
Passin' one bottle, forty ounce old E
I didn't have a dollar but a nigga had a dream
Whippin' over the stove and a nigga gotta eat
Threw my raps in the garbage, fuck bein' an emcee
Thank the Lord for Nate Dogg and thank God for Warren G
Funny how time flies when you're high as me


I think I'm in the Ruff Endz, now
I seen her throwin' up H-Town
You was livin' off of a Dru Hill
Wasn't ready for the rubber, baby, who is?
Know you prettier than all the El Debarges
Never worry 'bout the Total of the charges

And if you need an Xscape for now, meet up at room 112
We do it anywhere
And if you feelin', just call me, baby
I'll have you screamin'
Oooh, oooh

We'll get back to all that ghetto shit we like
But for now just let me hold you all night
Cheek to cheek just like they do in the movies
Tonight, baby, I want your love on time
As soon as I put this on
Cutey pie, you're the reason why
As soon as I put this on
I love ya so and I never let ya go
As soon as I put this on, girl
Oooh, yeah
As soon as I put this on
Don't fight it, let it live

And if you need an Xscape for now, meet up at room 112
We do it Anywhere (We can do it anywhere)
And if you feelin' (If you need a freak), just call me, baby
I'll have you screamin'
Oooh, oooh

We'll get back to all that ghetto shit when we like
But for now just let me hold you all night
Cheek to cheek just like they do in the movies
Tonight, baby, I want your love on time
As soon as I put this on
Cutey pie, you're the reason why
As soon as I put this on
I love ya so and I never let ya go
As soon as I put this on, girl
Oooh, yeah
As soon as I put this on
