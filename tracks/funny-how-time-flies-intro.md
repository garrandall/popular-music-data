Funny how time flies
Funny how time flies when you're making love
Funny how time flies when you're making love
Funny how time flies when you're making love


Funny how time flies when you're making love
It goes on and on, and on we just can't go wrong
Funny how time flies when you're making love
It goes on and on, and on we just can't go wrong


Saturday night, I feel alright heading to your place
Kiss your lips, fingertips slide down past my waist
Feel the heat, rising me just inside your door
Throw me down, back to the ground under and explore, yeah
You keep my mind on baby you know what to do
The way you slide down on me I get so into you
Girl your love is what I need and I don't want to be missin'
So do whatever you want to me tonight
And let the time keep on slippin', slippin'

You got me hypnotized, mesmerized
Inside your thighs, gonna take a ride
In and out, just let it flow and I don't want to let it go
I feel your body start to shiver ready to deliver
Can I get wet, can I get some baby oh, here she comes
You keep my mind on baby you know what to do
The way you slide down on me I get so into you
Girl your love is what I need and I don't want to be missin'
So do whatever you want to me tonight
And let the time keep on slippin', slippin'

Funny how time flies, funny how time flies
Funny how time flies, funny how time flies
Funny how time flies when you're making love
Better get down, get down, get down, get down
