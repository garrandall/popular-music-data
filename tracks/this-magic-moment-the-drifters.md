This magic moment
So different and so new
Was like any other
Until I kissed you
And then it happened
It took me by surprise
I knew that you felt it too
By the look in your eyes


Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want I have
Whenever I hold you tight


This magic moment
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever
Forever til the end of time


Oh
Oh
Mm


Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want I have
Whenever I hold you tight


This magic moment
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever
Forever til the end of time


Oh
Magic moment
Magic moment
Magic moment
