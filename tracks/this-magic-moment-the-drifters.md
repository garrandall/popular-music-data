This magic moment
So different and so new
Was like any other
Until I kissed you

And then it happened
It took me by surprise
I knew that you felt it too
By the look in your eyes

Sweeter than wine (sweeter than wine)
Softer than a summer night (softer than a summer night)
Everything I want, I have (everything, everything)
Whenever I hold you tight

This magic moment (this magic moment)
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever
Forever till the end of time

(This magic moment)
(This magic moment)

Sweeter than wine (sweeter than wine)
Softer than a summer night (softer than a summer night)
Everything I want, I have (everything, everything)
Whenever I hold you tight

This magic moment (this magic moment)
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever (this magic moment)
Forever till the end of time (magic)
