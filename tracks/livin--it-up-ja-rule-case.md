Yeah, yeah, yeah
We all my...
Yeah
C'mon, c'mon, uh
To all my bitches that be givin' it up, uh
To all my niggas that be livin' it up, we say...
To all my bitches that be givin' it up, ah
C'mon


Baby, you're such a typical, everyday, one night thing
It's a physical, I'ma fuck, you tonight thing
Fuck, knowing your name, get your ass in the Range
And rollover, gettin' blown while blowing the doja
Bring head to a closure
That's a good bitch
Before it's all over, I'ma leave this bitch
Probably treat this bitch, smoke better
'Cause if you ain't know, gangstas and hoes go together
Poppin' my collar, partna
Who in the spot?
Baby, Rule in the spot
In the mug and the watch, love me
Half the hoes hate me, half them love me
The ones that hate me only hate me 'cause they ain't fucked me
And they say I'm lucky
Do you think I've got time to fuck all these hoes?
And do all these shows?
Or flight in the lama, Dodge and White Rolls
Uh-oh, another episode


What, do I do?
To all my niggas that be livin' it up, we say...
What, I do
To all my bitches that be givin' it up, uhh
What, you do
To all my niggas that be livin' it up, we say...
What, do I do?
To all my bitches that be givin' it up, uhh
My love for you
C'mon


Bitches, just wanna hold the name exactly
That's why they suck dick with more passion than apples
And I ain't mad at'cha
Never leave you alone
'Cause we fucks when I'm home
Phone sex when I'm gone
We both grown, both got minds of our own
Bust our freaks off like old dog and Love Jones
Been, in many zones, baby
One hoe, two hoes
Fuck prizzy bitches, the hoes that do bono
But you know, the Rule be livin' it up
And got all these hoes, givin' it up
I like a little Rule baby, how cute are you?
With a body that rides all sexual
I got a stick, I'll ride right next to you
Do a doughnut, and cut, and I'll open it up
On the freeway, dick in her mouth, foot on the clutch
Rule bitch, not givin' a fuck




C'mon, we get high
C'mon, we get ride
C'mon, we get live
Live yo' life


Love you so sexy, I just want you next to me
Your whole vibe, like you high on Extasy
'Caue ain't nuthin' but an "E" thang baby
I know that pussy wet like crazy
I wanna feel your passion, come when you ask me
Laugh when you cry, cry when you laughin'
But ain't nothin' happenin'
The bitch got a little too high
Picked up my ride and started crackin'
The radio blastin' +Between Me And You+
But you ain't on the low with that freak shit you do
I thought you knew (What I do)
Know I know (What you do)
'Cause it's been a good night, your head ain't right
Like Teddy P, let's +Turn Off The Light+'
And grind it out, takin' no times out
'Til the sun come out
Bitch, when you find out

C'mon, we get high
C'mon, we get ride
C'mon, we get live
C'mon, it's my time
