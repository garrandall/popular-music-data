You're so terrific, mmm
You never done it like that
You never been this way before
To be specific, ooh
You never done it like that
Who went and opened up the door?

Oh, my lips are burnin', yeah
You never done it like that
I thought the flame was dead and gone
Oh, but you've been learnin', yeah
You never done it like that
How long has this been goin' on?

Ooh, who's been teachin' you?
Hey, little man, I wanna shake your hand
One kiss from you and I feel just like Columbus
I did discover you're some kinda lover

My mind is blowin', ooh
You never done it like that
You got me climbin' up the walls
Ooh, my love is growin', yeah
You never done it like that
You know you made me ten feet tall

Ooh, what you're doin' (Ooh, what you do)
Ooh, what you're doin' (Ooh, what you do)

Ooh, what you're doin' (Ooh, what you do)
Yeah, what you're doin' (Ooh, what you do)
Oh, what you're doin' (Ooh, what you do)
You never done it, you never done it (You never done it)
You never done it like that (You never, ever done it like that)

Ooh, what a feelin', yeah
You never done it like that
Not since I can remember when
Oh, on the ceilin', yeah
You never done it like that
Looks like we've got it on again

Ooh, what you're doin' (Ooh, what you do)
Yeah, what you're doin' (Ooh, what you do)
Oh, what you're doin' (Ooh, what you do)
You never done it, you never done it (You never done it)
You never done it like that (You never, ever done it like that)
