I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better


You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's going to be alright
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright


No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you


When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain


You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's going to be alright
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright


No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel


I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try, try to divide, something so real
So till the end of time, I'm telling you there ain't no one


No one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you


Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
