If Young Metro don't trust you I'ma shoot you


Hey, I, count the guwop (count, count)
Set up shop (oh, oh), fuck the cops (fuck 12)
We ain't worried (not at all)
Diamonds (diamonds) on my wrist look like McFlurry's (oh lord)
And these, thotties ain't got manners, slurpin'

Ice out the gang, make an Emoji a chain (hey)
Ice out the gang, make an Emoji a chain (whoo)
Put on the Patek, changing the weather
The shit turning into the rain (rain)
Put on the Patek, changing the weather
The shit turning into the rain
Ice out the gang, make an Emoji a chain (hey)
Ice out the gang, make an Emoji a chain (whoo)
Put on the Patek, changing the weather
The shit turning into the rain (rain)
Put on the Patek, changing the weather
The shit turning into the rain

Niggas out here ain't got stain (yeah)
Making this money, been balling on niggas
They think I've been sounding too lame
Pull up and "what the fuck nigga" that's strange (what the fuck)
Water on my neck and my wrist (splash, splash)
Look at this fluid (splash)
200 sit on my dash, smash
12, I'ma lose 'em
Hot commodity, the dope on hot commodity
The drop is on fire
I'm at the top and I took your slot, you niggas ain't hot (cold)
Go to the lot and drop
I want the drop, robot
Niggas gon' talk and pop
You get shot out your socks
What you want lil mama? Go 'head and fuck on my partner
Comfort your head like a liner
White, these diamonds albino
Wrapping the brick like a gyro
Migo gang Cinco De Mayo

Hey, I, count the guwop (count, count)
Set up shop (oh, oh), fuck the cops (fuck 12)
Wayne worried (not at all)
Diamonds (diamonds) on my wrist look like McFlurry's (oh lord)
And these, thotties ain't got manners, slurpin'

Ice out the gang, make an Emoji a chain
Ice out the gang, make an Emoji a chain
Put on the Patek, changing the weather
The shit turning into the rain
Put on the Patek, changing the weather
The shit turning into the rain
Ice out the gang, make an Emoji a chain
Ice out the gang, make an Emoji a chain
Put on the Patek, changing the weather
The shit turning into the rain
Put on the Patek, changing the weather
The shit turning into the rain


Flipping the bird, I put a brick in her purse
These niggas evil, a curse
I pray and send 'em to church
I'ma pull up on your turf
I'm with the smoking, who get it first
No addy but I'ma learn
I ain't been hurt since birth
I know my rights and worth
Birds and Gerald LaVert
I show you the plug at work
He careful from sittin' but I was a curve
She pull up on me, a curve
Hop in the Rolls and swerve
The watch two tone
It's white and red so much water
I'ma have to learn how to surf (surf)


Hey, I, count the gwap (count, count)
Set up shop (oh, oh), fuck the cops (fuck 12)
Wayne worried (not at all)
Diamonds (diamonds) on my wrist look like McFlurry's (oh lord)
And these, thotties ain't got manners, slurpin'

Ice out the gang, make an Emoji a chain
Ice out the gang, make an Emoji a chain
Put on the Patek, changing the weather
The shit turning into the rain
Put on the Patek, changing the weather
The shit turning into the rain
Ice out the gang, make an Emoji a chain
Ice out the gang, make an Emoji a chain
Put on the Patek, changing the weather
The shit turning into the rain
Put on the Patek, changing the weather
The shit turning into the rain


You can't get a bag, makin' me laugh (hah) my hips
I Gucci my belt, makin' an emoji my whip (emoji)
Huncho barbarian, McLaren, I park at fif's
And the comparison, I'm staring at lines of shrimps
Cruise, of course, like a blimp
Dunking a boat like I'm Kim
Slangin the like a chimp
Shot on me walk with a limp
Niggas so don't attempt
Ice on change the temp
No sense bangin' them
Don't let strangers in
Twist your fingers in
Gangsters shit begin
Used to get in and kickin' the doors and now I want the back end
Used to sleep on Metro's floors, fuckin' a bitch and her friend
Waking them up with a text, say "hoe, let your day begin"


Hey, I, count the gwap (count, count)
Set up shop (oh, oh), fuck the cops (fuck 12)
Wayne worried (not at all)
Diamonds (diamonds) on my wrist look like McFlurry's (oh lord)
And these, thotties ain't got manners, slurpin'

Ice out the gang, make an Emoji a chain
Ice out the gang, make an Emoji a chain
Put on the Patek, changing the weather
The shit turning into the rain
Put on the Patek, changing the weather
The shit turning into the rain
Ice out the gang, make an Emoji a chain
Ice out the gang, make an Emoji a chain
Put on the Patek, changing the weather
The shit turning into the rain
Put on the Patek, changing the weather
The shit turning into the rain
