Yeah

Every kiss is a door
Can I knock on yours, can we knock a little more
If a touch is a key
Keep on twisting, keep unlocking, keep on turning me

Let me in
I wanna be closer to you, let you under my skin
If I let you in
You gotta be careful with it, let me tell you again, hey

Love so soft, you ain't had nothing softer
Break it then you buy it and it's sure gonna cost ya
Love so soft that you can't rub off
You gon' love it if you try it, got you hooked, now you're caught up
Love so soft, so soft
Love so soft, so soft

If a thought was the truth
We'd be doing all the kinds of things I know you wanna do
But I need, need to know (Need to know)
Will you protect me, respect me if I let you close?

Let (come on, let) me in (Let me in, let me in)
I wanna be closer to you, let you under my skin
If I let (If I let) you in (Let you in, let you in)
You gotta be careful with it, let me tell you again (Hey)

Love so soft, you ain't had nothing softer
Break it then you buy it and it's sure gonna cost ya
Love so soft that you can't rub off
You gon' love it if you try it, got you hooked, now you're caught up
Love so soft, so soft
Love so soft, so soft

If you want this love, gotta hold it tight
Never let it go, baby, let it give you life (give you life)
If you want this love, gotta hold it tight
Never let it go, baby, let it give you life

Love so soft, you ain't had nothing softer
(You ain't had, you ain't had it)
Break it then you buy it and it's sure gonna cost ya
(Oh, yeah, oh, oh)
Love so soft that you can't rub off
You gon' love it if you try it, got you hooked, now you're caught up

If you want this love (if you want it), gotta hold it tight (if you want it)
(Love so soft, so soft)
Never let it go, baby (No), let it give you life
(Love so soft, so soft)

(Love so soft, love so soft) Oh, so soft
(Love so soft, love so soft)
If you want this love, gotta hold it tight
(Love so soft, love so soft)
Never let it go, baby
(Love so soft, love so soft)
Come on love, come on, come on, love

Love-love-love-love, love-love-love-love
(Love so soft, so soft)
If you want it, baby
(Love so soft, so soft, yeah)
