Oh, girl, you know like I know, uh-huh
What your lovin, girl, has done for me
Like a Mona Lisa hangin on a wall, uh-huh

You're a lovely sight, lovely sight to see, mmm, hm
The way you give me your sweet love
Any place and time when you look at me I get weak in my knees
I'm so thankful that you're mine

Your sweetness is my weakness, yeah
Girl, your sweetness is my weakness, yeah, yeah
Sweetness is my weakness, well
Your sweetness is my weakness

They all say that I'm a fool, uh-huh
For lovin you, for lovin you this way
But sure as I am, I don't give a damn
About what the people, what the people say

Other girls try to imitate you
With the other boys, uh-huh
But I'm the only boy round here
Whose got the real macoy

Sweetness is my weakness, yeah, yeah
Sweetness is my weakness, yeah (Uh-huh), yeah (Uh-huh)
Sweetness is my weakness, yeah (Oh), yeah (Oh)
Sweetness is my weakness, yeah, yeah
Sweetness is my weakness
