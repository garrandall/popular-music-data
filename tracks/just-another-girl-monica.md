You think you're slick in every way
Changing up on your calls
On your phone every day

Is there something that
You're trying to hide from me?
I never gave you reason to
Run and take your calls in the other room


Am I the only one
Or is somebody else kissing at you?
Is this my imagination?
Things ain't always what they seem
'Cause I don't want to be


Just another name in your little black book
Just another face in the crowd
And it's got me shook
I've got to mean a little more to you
Than a space in your list of things to do

Another g-shock gun in your Benz
Another dime piece
That you can show all your friends
You can call me crazy
Say I'm insecure
But I don't wanna be just another girl

Ooooh
Ohhhh
Ohhh
Mmm, hhmmm


Strange how you claim to tell all the truth
When the passenger seat
In your car has been moved

And you swore that there was no one else but you
And something else you can't explain
Why'd you called me by somebody else's name?


You say it's history
Your player days are through
Or so you say
Is this my imagination?
Things ain't always what they seem
'Cause I don't want to be




Tell me how you lie
Or is it my suspicious mind
I've gotta know the truth
If I am just another girl you treated wrong
Another one you string along

Is it you and me?
Is it two or three?
'Cause I don't want to be
