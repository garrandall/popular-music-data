Stir it up
Stir it up
Stir it up
Stir it up
I can't sit here while I go nowhere
Chase my dreams through the polluted air
Walking on a wire, running out of time
There's no room in this ol' heart of mine
Bill collectors waiting down the hall
Neighbors scream and crack the bedroom wall
Nerves jump off the pavement, passion hits the street
Angels cookin' in the city heat
World's too crazy, I can't take no more
I won't stay here locked behind the door
Baby, stir it up, got to break it up now
When I think about tomorrow, oh, I can't wait to
Stir it, got to shake it up now
If I have to beg or borrow, I'm not gonna take it anymore, mmm, mmm
Hungry minds do stare you in the eyes
Spread it thick and lay the biggest lies
Don't say what you feel, must play hard to get
All those time bombs tickin' in your head
So much pressure to keep holdin' on
Pack my clothes up, baby, I'll be gone
I've got to stir it up, got to break it up now
When I think about tomorrow, oh, I can't wait to
Stir it, got to shake it up now
If I have to beg or borrow, I'm not gonna take it anymore, mmm, mmm
Can't find love because it's trapped inside
Can't find freedom flirting with line
Make some room in this ol' heart of mine
So much pressure to keep holdin' on
Pack my clothes up, baby, I'll be gone
Stir it up, I've got to break it up now
When I think about tomorrow, I can't wait to
Stir it, got to shake it up now
If I have to beg or borrow, I don't wanna take it anymore
Stir it up, got to break it up now
When I think about tomorrow, I can't wait to
Stir it, got to shake it up now
If I have to beg or borrow, I don't wanna take it anymore

Stir it up
Stir it up
Stir it up
Stir it up
Stir it up
Baby, there is so much pressure to keep me holdin' on
Got to pack up my clothes and, baby, I'll be gone
Stir it up, got to break it up now
When I think about tomorrow, I can't wait to
Stir it, got to shake it up now
If I have to beg or borrow, I don't wanna take it no more
Stir it up, got to break it up now
I'm gonna stir it up, gonna stir it up
I'm not gonna take it no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more
Mmm Stir it up, got to break it up now
Stir it up, got to break it up now
(Mmm...got to stir it up)
Stir it up, got to break it up now
(Stir it up, baby, I...I'm gettin' out of here)
Stir it up, got to shake it up now
(Stir it up, baby, I...I'm gettin' out of here)
Stir it up, got to break
it up now Stir it, got to shake it up now
If I have to beg or borrow, I don't wanna take it no more
Stir it up, got to break it up now
When I think about tomorrow, I can't wait to
Stir it, got to shake it up now
I'm gonna stir it up, gonna stir it up
I'm not gonna take it no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more
Mmm Stir it up, got to break it up now
Stir it up, got to break it up now
(Oh...got to sir it up)
Stir it up, got to break it up now
(Stir it up, baby, I...I'm gettin' out of here)
Stir it up, got to shake it up now
(Stir it up, baby, I...I'm gettin' out of here)
Stir it up, got to break it up no
