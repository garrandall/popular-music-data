I saw a child, he was carryin' a light
I asked where it came from, he blew it right out
His eyes looked into me, his voice was a song
He said 'Tell me, tell me, do you know where it's gone?'

Oh glory, glory
My eyes have seen the mountain
My soul can sing the song
Oh Lord glory, glory
Singing hallelujah
The truth keeps marchin' on, oh yes it does now, oh Lord

Every mornin' the sun lights us all, the trees ask for nothing
They just let their fruit fall
Fires the same, no matter what the source
And the flame of life burns on, it's never never lost

I got to sing glory, glory
My eyes have seen the mountain
My soul can sing the song
(Glory, glory)
Singing hallelujah
The truth keeps marchin' on

I got to sing it
(Glory, glory)
(My eyes have seen the mountain)
(My soul can sing the song)
(Glory, glory)
Singing hallelujah
The truth keeps marchin' on
