Ohh, I, I will survive
As long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
'Coz I've got all, all my life to live
And I've got so much love to give
I will survive, I'll survive, I will, I will survive

Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me
With goodbye, did you think I'd crumble?
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me
With goodbye, did you think I'd crumble?
I will, I will, I will survive

I was afraid, I was petrified
Thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
And now I've spent so many nights
Thinkin' how you did me wrong
But I grew strong, I learned how to get along

To you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here
With that sad look upon your face
I should have changed all the locks
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me

Oh, now go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Coz you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me
With goodbye, did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
'Coz I got all my life to live
And I got all my love to give
And I will survive, I will survive

Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me
With goodbye?

Took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent so many nights
Feeling sorry for myself, I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high

And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person
That still in love with you
An' so you feet like droppin' in
An' thinkin' that I would be free
But now I'm savin' all my lovin'
For someone who's lovin' me

Oh, now go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Coz you're not welcome anymore, no
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me
With goodbye, did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
'Coz I got all my life to live
And I got all my love to give
And I will survive, yes, I will, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

If you wanna know do I need you?
No, no, no
I will, I will, I will, I will survive

So long, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
So long, bye, bye, bye, bye
So long, bye, bye, bye, bye
So long, bye, bye, bye, bye

So long, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
So long, bye, bye, bye, bye
So long, bye, bye, bye, bye
So long, bye, bye, bye, bye

I will, I will, I will survive
I will, I will, I will survive
