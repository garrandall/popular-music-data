Up and down
Runnin' all around
That's how it is, girl
(That's how it is)
'Til it comes
('Til it comes)

Feelin' sad
Sugar, it hurts so bad
That's how it is, girl yeah
'Til it comes
('til it comes)

I said, 'til it comes, yeah!
The love I want from you
I won't sleep a wink
I won't even think
Of nothin' but you
Day and night...
(Night and day)
Day and night...
(Night and day)
Hey!

I said, 'til it comes, yeah!
The love I want from you
You'll be on my mind
All of the time
Day and night...
(Night and day)
Day and night...
(Night and day)
Hey!

Up and down
Runnin' all around
That's how it is, girl
(That's how it is)
'Til it comes
('Til it comes)

Up and down
Runnin' all around
That's how it is, girl
(That's how it is)
'Til it comes
('Til it comes)

Up and down
Runnin' all around
That's how it is, girl
(That's how it is)
'Til it comes
('Til it comes)

Up and down
Runnin' all around
That's how it is, girl
(That's how it is)
'Til it comes
('Til it comes)
