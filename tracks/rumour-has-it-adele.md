Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

She, she ain't real
She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history
Or don't you remember?
Sure, she's got it all
But, baby, is that really what you want?

Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of you
And, boy, she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt
But you're cold to the core
Now rumour has it she ain't got your love anymore

Rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)

She is half your age
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you stayed
I heard you've been missing me
You've been telling people things you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out and she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumours?

(Bless your soul!)
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me
And, boy, you're bringing me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core
But rumour has it I'm the one you're leaving her for

Rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)

All of these words whispered in my ear
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it
People say crazy things
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it
Just 'cause you heard it

Rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)

But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)

But rumour has it he's the one I'm leaving you for
