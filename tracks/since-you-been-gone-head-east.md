I get the same old dream same time every night
Fall to the ground and I wake up

So I get out of bed put on my shoes and in my head
Thoughts go back to the breakup
These four walls are closin' in
Think of the fix you put me in

Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm outta my head can't take it

Could I be wrong since you been gone
You cast the spell so break it
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Can't take it

And in the night I stand beneath the backstreet lights
I read the words that you sent to me

I can take the afternoon
But night time comes around too soon
You can't know what you mean to me

Your poison letter your telegram
They go to show you don't give a damn

Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm outta my head can't take it

Could I be wrong since you been gone
You cast the spell so break it
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Can't take it
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)

If you will look back baby I'm here whenever you
Want
Do-do-do

Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm outta my head can't take it

Could I be wrong since you been gone
You cast the spell so break it
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Ever since you been gone

Since you been gone

Since you been gone
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Ever since you been gone
