It's better to have it (have it)
And not need it (need it)
Than to need it, than to need it
Baby, baby, and not have it now
(Have it)
Talking about love
L-o-v-e, love, baby
It's something else, honey
When you don't have it
Now listen
You left me, baby
Went on out of town
That wehen you got back
Mmm, you didn't wanna
See me around, baby
But I got so lonesome
I just didn't know
What to do with myself, baby
But I needed love
Now, everybody say yeah (yeah, yeah)
Everybody say yeah now (yeah, yeah)
Evertbody say yeah (yeah, yeah)
Say it a little bit louder now (yeah, yeah)
Sometime it make me feel weak (yeah, yeah)
Sometime it make me feel weak (yeah, yeah)
Till I can't hardly eat, baby (yeah, yeah)
Sometime it make me feel weak (yeah, yeah)
Whoa, I can't hardly eat, baby (yeah, yeah)
It's better to have it (have it)
And not need it, honey (need it)
Than to need it, than to need it
Baby, baby, and not have it now
(Have it)
Talking about love
L-o-v-e, love, baby
It's something else, honey
Yeah, when you don't have it
Now, everybody say yeah (yeah, yeah)
Everybody say yeah now (yeah, yeah)
Evertbody say yeah (yeah, yeah)
Say it a little bit louder now (yeah, yeah)
Sometime it make me feel weak (yeah, yeah)
Sometime it make me feel weak...
