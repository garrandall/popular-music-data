A lot of these cats out here be fakin
When it comes to makin love
But you and me baby
This is real...
And that's why it's...



(Number one)
Sex that we're having
Here girl
Oh(this is, this is number one)
Sex that we're having here girl
You better ask somebody..


Can't nobody do it like us
Can't nobody mix chop and screw it like us
All over the living room hittin it like us
In the middle of the night wake up the building like us
But it's oookay if you wanna brag
The sex so good
Go and pat yourself on the back
And them haaaters, they gon hate
But we just gon keep on blowing up cause girl
They gon hate, anyway
You are now rocking with the best (best, best, best...)
I'll make you forget about the rest
Having sex with you is like makin hits
Girl we got egos they can't tell us that we ain't the shit
I'm in your mix like a number one record
And the beat goes on and on
And it don't stop you keep going from the night onto the day
And I love it when you take me down and make me say-ay..


(Number one)
Sex that we're having
Here girl
Oh(this is, this is number one)
Sex that we're having here girl, oh

Keri!


You know you stay at the top spot
When you're breaking me down like a chop shop, eh
Cutting like some blades on a caddy
That's how you're working me, daddy
Everytime you put that on
You are now rocking with the best
I'll make you forget about your ex
This one here's a race where you don't wanna come first
I know what I'm doing ain't no need to rehearse yeah-ee-yeah
A lot of dudes just be going nowhere fast
But you be steady cruising like you want it to last
That's how you made me a chocoholic
And right now my body's calling
I gotta know how you got the knowhow
Baby you the champ of all that goes down
If your -- was a gun it would stone cold?
With my RNB thug when I bang bang
You know Kells and Keri hook up like that you make it number one


(Number one)
Sex that we're having
Here girl
Oh(this is, this is number one)
Sex that we're having here girl, oh


Hands down you the best
Ain't no competition
You and me in this bed
Just what I was wishin
Them other girls was cool but it's somethin they was missin
And I don't call them back every since we hit it in the kitchen
That night
At my home
Trench coat
Nothin on
Your sex
Got me gone
Went straight
To my dome
And I love it woo
Girl I love it woo
And I love it woo
Girl I love it woo
Girl it's somethin about you that thrills me
That's why after we lay you get to know the real me-e-e-yeah
And it don't stop you keep going from the night onto the day
And I love it when you take me down and make me say
Eyyyyyy


(Number one)
Sex that we're having
Here girl
Oh(this is, this is number one)
Sex that we're having here girl, oh


Girl I vow that I would do anything to pleasure you
All I wanna do is make this last
I'll kiss you up I kiss you down
Be real quiet or making sounds
Take it slow or take it fast
And wooo
And wee
And yoouuu
And me
Havin fun
And when it's over in the morning i'll say gracias baby
Before you go I'll scream damelo

(Num-num-number one, number one
This is, this is number one)
