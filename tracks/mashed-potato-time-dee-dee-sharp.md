It's the latest, it's the greatest
Mashed potato, ya, ya, ya

A mashed potato started long time ago
With a guy named sloppy Joe
You'll find this dance is so cool to do
Come on baby, gonna teach it to you

Mashed potato, feel it in your feet now
Mashed potato, come on get the beat now
Baby, come on honey, come on baby

And then they dance it through and through
They look for records they can do it to
They got a dance was outta sight
Doin' the lion sleeps tonight

Mashed potato, ya a weem o wep a weem o wep
Mashed potato, ya, ya, ya, ya
It's the latest, aw baby
It's the greatest, come on honey
Ya, ya ya, ya

Now everybody is doin' fine
They dance alone or in a big boss line
And they discovered it's the most, man
The day they did it to please Mr. Postman

Mashed potato, wait a minute, wait a minute
Mashed potato, deliver de letter
It's the latest, come on baby
It's the greatest, oh honey
Ya, ya, ya, ya

Well they got with more and more
Ya ought to see 'em around the floor
The mashed potato 
They even do it to dear lady twist

Mashed potato, ya, ya, ya, ya
It's the latest, come on baby
It's the greatest, oh honey
Mashed potato, feel the groovy beat now
