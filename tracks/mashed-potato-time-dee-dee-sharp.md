It's the latest, it's the greatest
Mashed Potato, ya, ya ,ya

A Mashed Potato started long time ago
With a guy named Sloppy Joe
You'll find this dance is so cool to do
Come on baby, gonna teach it to you

Mashed Potato, get up to the beat now
Mashed Potato, come on and twist your feet now
Baby, come on honey, come on baby

And then this dance just grew and grew
They look for records they can do it to
They found this dance was outta sight
Doin' the lion sleeps tonight

Mashed Potato, Ya a weem o wep a weem o wep
Mashed Potato, ya, ya, ya, ya
It's the latest, aw baby
It's the greatest, come on honey
Ya, ya ya, ya

Now everybody is doin' fine
They dance alone for a bit more time
Then they discovered it's the most, man
The day they did it to Please Mr. Postman

Mashed Potato, wait a minute, wait a minute
Mashed Potato, deliver de letter
It's the latest, come on baby
It's the greatest, oh honey
Ya, ya, ya, ya

Well they got with it more and more
Ya ought to see 'em around the floor
The Mashed Potato took a long, long list
They even do it to Dear Lady Twist

Mashed Potato, ya, ya, ya, ya
It's the latest, come on baby
It's the greatest, oh honey
Mashed potato, feel the groovy beat now
