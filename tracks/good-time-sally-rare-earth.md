When I first came to the city
I had a twenty dollar bill in my jeans
And I thought that I must be in heaven
'Cause I found the little girl of my dreams

I was just new in the city now
And she was so young and pretty now
She showed me a brand new world
Oh Sally, Sally was a good time girl

Well, I showed her all of my money
And she showed me a real good time
I mean I took her out, she took me in
Oh Sally was a friend of mine

I was just new in the city now
And she was so young and pretty now
She showed me a brand new world
Oh Sally, Sally was a good time girl
Hey yeah, alright

Well, it turns out Sally had a roommate
And Sally's room mate had a gun
Well, he look like he might've played foot
Hey, sure glad he couldn't run

Last time I saw Sally
Well, it wasn't any time for goodbyes
But I know that I'll remember
Oh Sally was a friend of mine

I was just new in the city now
And she was so young and pretty now
She showed me a brand new world
Oh Sally, Sally was a good time

Sally, hey, sally
Oh Sally was a good time girl
(Sally was a good time)
Sally, hey now
(Sally)
I'll always remember
(Sally)

Sally was a good time
Sally, talking 'bout Sally, yeah
Sally was a good time
Sally was a good time
Sally was a good time girl
