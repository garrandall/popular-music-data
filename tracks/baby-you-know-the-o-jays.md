Baby, you know
That we should be together forever
Come on, come on, come on
Come on come on
And baby, you know
That you should be with me forever
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on


Ever since the first day I met you
Ever since the first time I saw you
I knew that it had to be me and you
Me for you
Me with you
Forever, forever, baby, forever


If you were my baby
I would give you everything
And if I owned the world, girl
It would be all yours, all yours
We can build a house made for two
It will be me and you
We can raise a family
A girl for you, a boy for me
Oh, baby, baby


Baby, you know
That we should be together forever
Come on, come on, come on
Come on come on
And baby, you know
That you should be with me forever
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on


Here I am with open arms
Willing to give it my all and all
And girl just trust in me
Put your heart in my hands
I promise I won't hurt you, baby
'Cause if I hurt you I'll be hurting me
Just open up your heart, let me in
Let, let me in


Baby, you know
That we should be together forever
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on
And baby, you know
That you should be with me forever
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on


Girl, don't be afraid
I wanna give my all and all to you, baby
Oh baby
I got what you need
Girl, you know you ought to be with me
Girl, I love you, girl, I love you
I'll do anything for your lovin'
Baby, you know
I'll do anything for your huggin'
Now baby, you know
Baby, you know
I'll do anything for your lovin'
I'll do anything for your kissin' babe
I'll do anything for your huggin'
I'll do anything without missin', babe


Baby, you know
That we should be together forever
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Baby, you know
That we should be together forever
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on
And baby, you know
That you should be with me forever
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on
