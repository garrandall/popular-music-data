Why do you keep on staring?
That mirror, mirror, it ain't fair at all (mm-mm)
Dress sizes can't define, don't let the world decide what's beautiful
No

You won't make yourself a name if you follow the rules
History gets made when you're acting a fool
So don't hold it back and just run it
Show what you got and just own it
No, they can't tear you apart

If you trust your rebel heart, ride it into battle
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on
Oh, oh-whoa, oh, oh-whoa
Take the road less traveled on

Don't follow anyone,
March to the rhythm of a different drum
Why do we analyze, break out, and criticize the crazy ones?
Oh

You won't make yourself a name if you follow the rules
History gets made when you're acting a fool
So don't hold it back and just run it
Show what you got and just own it
No, they can't tear you apart, no

If you trust your rebel heart, ride it into battle
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on
Oh, oh-whoa, oh, oh-whoa
Take the road less traveled on
Oh, oh-whoa, oh, oh-whoa
Take the road less traveled on

Put your hands up, show me that you're one of a kind
Put your hands up, let me hear your voice tonight
Oh

If you trust your rebel heart, ride it into battle
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on

If you trust your rebel heart, ride it into battle
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on
Oh, oh-whoa, oh, oh-whoa
Take the road less traveled on

Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on

Traveled on
Take the road less traveled on
