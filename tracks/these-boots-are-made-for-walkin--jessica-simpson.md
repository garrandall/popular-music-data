Are you ready boots?
Start walkin
Yee haw
C'mon
Letâs go

You keep saying you got something for me (uh)
Well officer I donât mind to say you do
Now your looking right where I thought youâd be looking
Legs come handy when laws in front of you

These boots are made for walkin
And thatâs just what theyâll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

You believe youâve stopped me for a reason (uh)
Now Iâm pretending my bendings just for fun
You keep playing where I got you playing (yeah)
These double 'Dâ initials work to run

These boots are made for walkin
And thatâs just what theyâll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

Iâm the girl with the good boys who donât mean you no harm
This gotten way with Hazzard County charm
There ain't no crime in havin' a little fun

Swerve my stride
Bat my sexy eyes
Where my boots at (haha)
Strut ya stuff come on

Hey yaâll 
Wanna come and see something (uh uh, uh uh)
Canât touch, can I get a hand clap for the way I work my back
Tick tock all around the clock drop it
Push ya tush, like that
Can I get a sueee
Can I get a yee haw

You keep thinking what you shouldnât be thinking
Another to far is down till you kissing ground
Iâm a gonna send you back home as you crying
But Uncle Jesse he sure is gonna be proud

These boots are made for walkin
And thatâs just what theyâll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you


These boots are made for walkin
And thatâs just what theyâll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

Come on boots
Start walking
Come on ladies

Hey yaâll 
Wanna come and see something (uh uh, uh uh)
Canât touch, can I get a hand clap for the way I work my back
Tick tock all around the clock drop it
Push ya tush, like that
Can I get a sueee
Can I get a yee haw

Come on Willie (ohh yeah, owww)
Yeee haw
Willie Nelson everybody (uh)
Letâs go home now
