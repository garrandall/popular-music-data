Are you ready boots?
Start walkin'
Let's go
Yee Haw
Come on
Let's go

You keep sayin you got somethin for me
Well officer I don't mind to say you do
Now your lookin right where I thought you'd be looking
Legs come handy when law's in front of you

These boots are made for walkin
That's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

You believe you've stopped me for a reason (uh)
Now I'm pretending my bendings just for fun
You keep playin where I got you playin (yeah)
These double - D initals work to run

These boots are made for walkin
And that's just what they'll do
One of theses days these boots are gonna walk all over you

(I'm just a girl)
I'm the girl with the good ol' boys who don't mean you no harm
Just got my way with hazzard county charm
There ain't no crime in havin little fun

Swerve my stride
Bat my sexy eyes
Where my boots at?(hah)
Strut ya stuff, come on

Hey ya'll
Wanna come and see something (uh uh, uh uh)
Can't touch, can I get a hand clap
For the way I work my back (with the daisy dukes)
Tick tock all around the clock
Drop it
Push ya tush, just like that
Can I get a sooey?
Can I get a yehaw?

You keep thinkin' what you shouldn't be thinkin'
Another two buttons down til you kissin' the ground
I'm a gonna send you back home as you crying (yeah)
But uncle Jesse, he sure is gonna be proud(uh,uh)

These boots are made for walkin
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

These boots are made for walkin
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk... all... o...ver...you

Come on boots
Start walking
Come on ladies

Hey ya'll
Wanna come and see something (uh uh, uh uh)
Can't touch, can I get a hand clap
For the way I work my back (with the daisy dukes)
Tick tock all around the clock drop it
Push ya tush, just like that
Can I get a sooey (sooey)
Can I get a yehaw (yehaw)

(Come on Willie oh yeah, owww)
Yehaw
Willie Nelson everybody (uh)
Let's go home now
