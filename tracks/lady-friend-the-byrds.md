Here it comes again, it's going to happen to me
Here it comes, I should have learned to duck
She's going to say, she's going away
And I will have to live without her and survive

Here it comes, it looks just like the last wave I drowned in
Here it comes, and I'm so far from shore
She's going to go, and take her trinkets
And I will have to live without her and survive

Here it comes again, the night is going to fall
Here it comes, she's going to say good-bye
She's going to go, and leave only me
And I will have to live without her and survive.
