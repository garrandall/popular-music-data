Close my mind, shut out the world
Walking to my pride of Harlem
No one there, but you and me, girl
And our love before our problems

There I kiss you with my mind
Over and over, time after time
I've learned that the past is never far behind
So it's there to remind me

Memories don't leave like people do
They always stay with you
Whether they've been good or bad
There never something that you had

Memories don't leave like people do
They always stay with you
Whether they've been good or bad
There never something that you had

People take all of the time
Walk out of your life and try to hurt you
But a memory wouldn't be that unkind
Playing to be a friend, then desert you

But I find joy in all the pain
Though your body is gone, the soul remains
The question is why did you have to leave
You could've been as faithful as a memory, 'cause you see

Memories don't leave like people do
They always stay with you
Whether they've been good or bad
There never something that you had

Memories don't leave like people do
They always stay with you
Whether they've been good or bad
There never something that you had

But I find joy in all the pain
Though your body is gone, the soul remains
The question is why did you have to leave
You could've been as faithful as a memory, 'cause you see

Memories don't leave like people do
They always stay with you
Whether they've been good or bad
There never something that you had

Memories don't leave like people do
They always stay with you
Whether they've been good or bad
There never something that you had
