Evening's settled down
Girl, I'm yours for the taking
I've got a fireplace to huddle round
Soon it's love we'll be making

Let's share our deepest secrets
And find the place that's weakest
And linger, mmm

Oh, baby, do it to my mind
I betcha that'll get it
Do it to my mind
Sugar, take your time

We must have
Loved somewhere before
Cause you've got the key
To every part of me

Say I just want to love you, baby
Let me love you, baby
More and more

Do it to my mind
That'll get it
Do it to my mind

When we share a fantasy
Girl, let's make it one to treasure
Cause our love runs wild and free
As we growl from this pleasure

Each is better than the first
And the best becomes the worst
We keep on trying

Yeah, baby, do it to my mind
Betcha that'll get it
Do it to my mind
That'll get it every time

What touches you, it touches me
If it pains you so, girl
I will set it free

Cause I just wanna love you, honey
Just wanna love you, baby
More and more and more and more

Oh, Lord, can't you see
Do it to my mind, well

What touches you, it touches me
If it pains you so, girl
Girl, I'm gonna set you free

Cause I just wanna love you, baby
Let me love you, baby
More and more and more and more
Oh, yeah, listen, baby

Do it to my mind
That'll get it
Do it to my mind
Sugar, take your time

Do it to my mind
Don't quit it
Do it to my mind
Steady with your rhyme

Do it to my mind
I betcha that'll get it
Do it to my mind
That'll get it every time

Do it to my mind
Keep doing what you're doing, baby
Do it to my mind
Mmm, that's fine

Do it to my mind
If you feel like moaning
Do it to my mind
I feel like moaning

Do it to my mind
Do it, do it, do it
Do it to my mind
Do it, do it, do it, do it

Do it to my mind
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it to my mind
Do it to my mind

Do it to my mind
Hold on to me, baby
Do it to my mind
Hold on to me, baby

Do it to my mind
I betcha that'll get it
Do it to my mind
That'll get it every time

Do it to my mind
Oh, I'm begging
Do it to my mind
Do it to my mind

Do it to my mind
Listen to the music, baby
Do it to my mind
That'll keep you with the time

Do it to my mind
Do what you're doing, baby
Do it to my mind
Steady with the rhyme

Do it to my mind
I betcha that'll get it
Do it to my mind
Mmm, mmm, mmm

Do it to my mind...
