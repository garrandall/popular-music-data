Girl I've finally got you up in the seat of my old truck
And I bet you're wonderin' what we're gonna do
We could hit the county line, hell we do that all the time
Tell you what, if you don't mind, we could start with something new
Instead of waiting like we usually do

Let's start it with a goodnight kiss, my lips, your lips,
Baby let's just skip gettin' there
Let's start it with a long goodbye, get wrapped up tight
Let's spend all night right here
Let's start it with a goodnight kiss

I know that you told all your friends we were meetin' up with them
I can call 'em all again and tell 'em we ain't coming
Let me find a little spot, let me throw this thing in park
Let me light that little spark that gets you going like you do
Just tell me that you want to

Start it with a goodnight kiss, my lips, your lips,
Baby let's just skip gettin' there
Let's start it with a long goodbye, get wrapped up tight
Let's spend all night right here
Let's start it with a goodnight kiss
Let's start it with a goodnight kiss

I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
Let's start it with a goodnight kiss,
My lips, your lips

Let's start it with a goodnight kiss, my lips, your lips,
Baby let's just skip gettin' there
Let's start it with a long goodbye, get wrapped up tight
Let's spend all night right here
Let's start it with a goodnight kiss
Let's start it with a goodnight kiss

I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
