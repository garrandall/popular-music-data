I love fucking these hoes, I love it (I do)
I love fucking these hoes, I love it (yeah, I do)
And I will never change for nothing (Cadet, Cadet, Cadet)

I'm a sick fuck, I like to quick fuck
We met on Insta, she liked my picture
In my DM's like come let's link up
No, I shouldn't buttfuck, I want my dick sucked
Pull up to the yard like lift your ting up
Undone my zipper, now push my ting up
Make too much noise, you have to whisper
Have you ever been fucked in Jordan slippers?
Like damn, I'm just bait like Antzzz
Fly boy, Peter Pan, I can never land
Wait, did I say that I was your man
Baby, I'm a liar, liar like Roxanne
No pity (no), we run the city (yeah)
Me and Deno, four days, one milli
Baby fall back, you should never try kiss me (nah)
You're gonna make us fight like Cardi B, Nicki - it's thicky


I love fucking these hoes, I love it (I do)
I love fucking these hoes, I love it (yeah, I do)
I love fucking these hoes, I love it (Cadet look what you got me on man)
And I will never change for nothing (I'm tryna be the good guy, I am, alright let me go, yeah)


I'm a sicko, I love these thick hoes
Where are you now, let me make you dip low (yikes)
She came with her sis, I work the big bro
When I saw the thong, I couldn't let Sisqo like woah
Drew her from the hill to the stage
She likes girls, but she's going through a phase
Now she thinks all because I got a song with Craig
That I'm gonna be waiting for seven days
But no, go ask another guy
She says she don't do this, that was another lie (liar)
She saw the ting bulging in my AJ boxers
Blud, it gave Tracey butterlies
Wow, she said "you're so silly"
I like a real ass, I don't mind no fake titties
Me and her were beefin' 'cause she couldn't get the willy
But last night, we squashed it like Drake and Meek Milly, ay


I love fucking these hoes, I love it
I love fucking these hoes, I love it (I do)
I love fucking these hoes, I love it (yeah, I do)
And I will never change for nothing (Cadet, Cadet, Cadet)


I love fucking these hoes, I loved it
Threesome I had one girl's mop in the other's bucket
