She had a bad childhood when she was very young
So don't judge her too badly
She had a schizophrenic mother who worked in the gutter
Would have sold herself to the devil gladly

What a sad environment, a bug-ridden tenement
And when they couldn't pay the rent because her father was out getting liquor
The stone's been cast in blood thicker than water

And the sins of a family fall on the daughter
And the sins of a family fall on the daughter

At the age of 16 she had been around
More than any girl of 30
And the high I.Q.'s who condemned her knew
She was a product of poor heredity, yeah

It's a fictitious fact when you fall on your back
You can backtrack failure with inspection
Without exception

And the sins of a family fall on the daughter
And the sins of a family fall on the daughter

Oh, the devil is open to all of us
Heaven selects just a precious few
And it takes some inside pull to get
Gabriel to make an angel out of you

One can't live a lie and expect to die
And with your soul in paradise
You know you gotta pay the price like you oughta!
Blood's thicker than water

And the sins of a family fall on the daughter
And the sins of a family fall on the daughter
Yeah!... and the sins of a family fall on the daughter
