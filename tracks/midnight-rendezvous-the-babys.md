Driving faster than you want me to
Can't help myself when I'm alone with you
All right
All right

I've passed the limit and there's no way back
Your kind of love gives me a heart attack
All right
All right

'Cause baby can't you see
We need to spend some time alone
We need to see some dreams come true
I wanna feel me touching you
We need a midnight rendezvous

On the freeway with the throttle down
You drive me crazy as we drive around
All right
All night

The way you look tonight you aim to please
The dress you're wearin' is way past your knees
All right
All right

'Cause baby can't you see
We need to spend some time alone
We need to see some dreams come true
I wanna feel you touching me
We need a midnight rendezvous

Midnight
Midnight rendezvous
Midnight
Midnight rendezvous
Midnight
Midnight rendezvous
Midnight
Midnight rendezvous
Yeah yeah

All I really wanna do
Spend some time alone with you
Yeah
A midnight
(Baby baby can you see)
(Baby baby you and me)
(Baby baby can you see)
(Baby baby you and me)
A midnight rendezvous
Yeah
All I really wanna do
Oh I really wanna fuck you
Oh
Midnight rendezvous
