Yoy're always in my heart
From early in the mornin' til it's dark
I gotta see your sweet , sweet smile every day

When I wake up in the mornin'
And I see you there
I always whisper a little prayer
I gotta see your sweet , sweet smile every day

 I gotta know that you love me
And that you want me
And that you'll always be there
I've gotta know that you care

 And I gotta feel your arms around me
And that you need me
And that you'll always be there
I've gotta know that you care

If my times are bringin' me down
You're the only one that I want around
I gotta see your sweet , sweet smile every day

And if I'll all strung out
You're the only one who can straighten me out
I gotta see your sweet , sweet smile every day






Yoy're always in my heart
From early in the mornin' til it's dark
I gotta see your sweet , sweet smile every day
I gotta see your sweet , sweet smile every day
I gotta see your sweet , sweet smile every day
