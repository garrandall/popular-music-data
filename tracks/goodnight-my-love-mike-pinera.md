Good night, my love, good night
When will I see you again?
Good night, my love, good night
When will I hold you again?
I know it's getting late,
And I really should be on my way
You know you make so very hard for me to say
Good night (good night), my love (my love)
Good night, my love, good night.
Swift time, my love, swift time
'Cause the morning light
Will rise and shine and find that we're together,
Together, tonight
I know it's getting late,
And I really should be on my way
You know you make it so very hard for me to say
Goodnight (goodnight), my love (my love)

(Solo)
I know it's getting late,
And I really should be on my way
You know you make it so very hard
For me to stay, goodnight
Goodnight, my love, goodnight

Goodnight, my love, goodnight
When will I see you again
Goodnight, my love, goodnight...
When will I hold you again
Goodnight, my love, goodnight...
Goodnight, my love, goodnight...
Lalalalalalalala
