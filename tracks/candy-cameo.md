Yeah, yeah, mmm

It's like candy
I can feel it when you walk
Even when you talk it takes over me

You're so dandy
I wanna know
Can you feel it too, just like I do?

Oh!

This stuff is starting now
It's the same feeling
I always seem to get around you

There's no mistaking, I'm clearly taken
By the simple mere thought of you

Oh!

This stuff is starting now
This stuff is starting now
This stuff is starting now
Oh!

My eyes roll in my head
I toss and turn in my bed
In the morning when I think about you

Yes, I do

Simply put you're the reason why
Even though I'm real shy (Real shy)
I attempt to look my best for you
Indeed I do, just for you

'Cause you affect me, fascinate me
I thank heaven for the things that you do

It's like candy
You sure are sweet (Sweet) (Sweet)
You're so dandy (Dandy)
You're taking my appetite but it's alright

It's like candy
Oh, vanilla
Oh, chocolate!

You look real nice, wrapped up tight
You're so dandy
You're giving me a heart attack
It's the kind I like

It's like candy
You're so dandy

Why you do

You're like a brand new feeling
In a special way
A surprise package
On a bright clear sunny day (You're so dandy)

And wrapped up tight (So good)
(So good, yeaheaheah)

Strawberry (Strawberry), raspberry (Raspberry)
All those good things
Violets and gumdrops
That's what you're saying to me, me (Me)

Ow!

Sweet candy
Candy
It's like candy
Sure seems like good candy to me

Oh, baby
Oh

You're so dandy (Watch this)
Ohoho
