Magnificent
Oh, oh, Magnificent

I was born, I was born to be with you
In this space and time
After that, and ever after, I haven't had a clue, only to regret
This foolishness can leave a heart black and blue, oh

Only love, only love can leave such a mark
But only love, only love can leave such a scar

I was born, I was born to sing for you
I didn't have a choice
To lift you up
And sing whatever song you wanted me to
I give you back my voice, from the womb
My first cry, it was a joyful noise, oh

Only love, only love can leave such a mark
And only love, only love can leave such a scar

Just a fire, till we die, you and I will magnify
Oh magnificent, magnificent
