Blue, navy blue, I'm as blue as I can be
'Cause my steady boy said "Ship ahoy"
And joined the Nay-ee-ay-vee

He said he wanted to settle down
And let me be his girl
But first he had to do a little travelin' around
And see the whole wide world

That's why I'm blue, navy blue
I'm as blue as I can be
'Cause my steady boy said "Ship ahoy"
And joined the Nay-ee-ay-vee

I got a letter yesterday from Tokyo
And a souvenir
A walky-talky wind-up little China doll
That says "Wish you were here"

Blue, navy blue, I'm as blue as I can be
'Cause my steady boy said "Ship ahoy"
And joined the Nay-ee-ay-vee

He's comin' home to see me on a weekend pass
A forty-eight hour day-ate
That boat he's sailin' on just better get here fast
'Cause I can hardly wait

Till then I'm blue, navy blue
I'm as blue as I can be
'Cause my steady boy said "Ship ahoy"
And joined the Nay-ee-ay-vee
