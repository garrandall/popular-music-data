I hardly even knew you
You called me on the phone
You took me to a movie
Now you wanna drive me home
I won't deny I like it
But you push it just a bit too hard
Yeah, yeah

You tell me that you love me
I've heard it all before
I really like your stories
But now I'm gonna shut the door
Don't put your arms around me
Confusion is in my heart

Well, you see, I can't defend against your touch
I'm afraid I got to like you a little too much

It's my female intuition
Protects me against your charms
But it drives me into your arms
My female intuition (Oh, yeah)
The woman in me does some checkin'
On the man in you

All the girls they tell me
Tell me you're no good
Guess they're all so jealous
Other I don't think they would
But there's a voice inside me
Telling me to not let go
Yeah, yeah

It's a competition
All the girls in town
I'll use my ammunition
'Cause I wanna wear the crown
So you better believe me
Boy, I'm gonna tie you down

Well, you see, I can't defend against your touch
I'm afraid I got to like you a little too much

It's my female intuition (Intuition)
Protects me against your charms but it drives me into your arms
My female intuition (Mmm)
The woman in me does some checkin'
On the man in you

It's my female intuition (Mmm)
Protects me against your charms but it drives me into your arms
My female intuition (Intuition)
The woman in me does some checkin'
On the man in you
You

Lovers come and lovers go
It's something every woman knows
Ever since you came my way
I'm doing everything to make you stay

Ooohooo
Ooohooo
Ooohooo
Ooohooo

It's my female intuition (Intuition)
Protects me against your charms but it drives me right into your arms
My female intuition (Mmm)
The woman in me does some checkin'
On the man in you

It's my female intuition (Mmm)
Protects me against your charms but drives me into your arms
My female intuition (Intuition)
The woman in me does some checkin'
On the man in you
