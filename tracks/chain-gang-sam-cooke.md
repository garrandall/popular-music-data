Hoh ah, hoh, I hear something saying
Hoh ah, hoh ah
Hoh ah, hoh ah


Well don't you know
That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain, gang
That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain, gang


All day long they're saying, hoh ah
Hoh ah, hoh ah, hoh ah


Well don't you know
That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain, gang
That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain, gang


All day long they work so hard till the sun is going down
Working on the highways and byways and wearing, wearing a frown
You hear they moaning their lives away
Then you hear somebody say;


Well don't you know
That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain, gang
That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain, gang


Can't you hear them singing, mmm hoh ah
I'm going home one of these days
I'm going home, see my woman
Whom I love so dear
But meanwhile, I gotta work right here


Well don't you know
That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain, gang
That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain, gang


All day long they're singing, mm hoh ah
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my work is so hard
Give me water, I'm thirsty, my, my work is so hard
Woah oh
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my work is so hard
