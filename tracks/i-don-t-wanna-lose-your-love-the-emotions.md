Dinner's ready
And the wine is chilled
My baby's coming over
Well, I know just how I feel

Because I don't
Wanna lose your love
Think how it feels, baby
It's gettin' harder to conceal, yeah

Do I fit in the life
You've been livin', boy?
(Baby, say I do)
Do you feel all the love
I've been givin' you?

Oh, when you come home
Do you care to see me?
Things ain't the way
They used to be, baby

But I can't believe
That's your only reason
You've got to say
Just what's the reason

Don't take my love
For granted, boy
And then turn around
And , whoa

I don't wanna lose your love
(I don't wanna)
I don't wanna lose your love
Don't wanna lose your love
(Don't wanna lose you)
I don't wanna lose your love
(Oh, come on)

Come on and say that you will
(Say you will)
I'll do the best to fulfill
(I will be there)
I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love

I think you need my love
You can't defeat my love
(My love)
You won't believe my love
(Don't wanna lose you)
I don't wanna lose your love

Hey, hey, yeah, hey, hey, well

You just don't know, oh, whoa
What you do to me, well
I wanna ask you somethin'
Hey, baby, hey, baby

I think we can make it
How 'bout you?
But don't just send me away
(Away)
To be alone I don't
Think I can take it

Cause if you tell me to go
(Yeah, I will)
I will leave you, oh
(For sure)
Don't ask me to stay
And do me wrong, yeah

Do I fit in the life
You've been livin', boy?
(Baby, say I do)
Do you feel all my love
I've been givin' you?

Whoa, I want the love
You love, most of all
Now you're the one
You never call, baby

But I don't think you really
Wanna leave me
(No, no)
I think you're confused
(No, no)
And you want to believe it

You can't take love
And just walk away
(Don't take it and walk away)
With the guilt that you carry
You'll be back some day, whoa

I don't wanna lose your love
(I don't wanna)
I don't wanna lose your love
Don't wanna lose your love
(Don't wanna lose you)
I don't wanna lose your love
(Well)

Come on and say that you will
I'll be there to fulfill
I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love

I don't wanna lose your love
Don't wanna lose your love
Don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love

Yeah, hey, oh, yeah
Ooh, you just don't know
No, what you do to me
Well, well, ooh, ooh

I don't wanna lose, lose your love
I don't wanna lose, lose your love
I don't wanna lose, lose your love
I don't wanna lose, lose your love
I don't wanna lose, lose your love
I don't wanna lose, lose your love
