You've been in love with her
And went away and broke your heart
Darling, dry your eyes, I realize
That you have got to make a new start

'Cause your baby's gone and left you
And you're making it hard
It's an uphill climb to the bottom
When your love has gone
When your love has gone

Some relationships produce anew
Something about your heart
When I looked at you all at once I knew
That we would never ever part

Yes, your baby's gone and left you
It's time for you to make it on your own
It's an uphill climb to the bottom
When your love has gone
When your love has gone

Listen, I think you and I can live
We can make some brand new dreams
Darling, take my hand, understand
No matter how hard it seems

Yes, all you've got to do is think about
How hard anyone can try
I've got to get you to try on and on
Try baby, I know

It's an uphill climb to the bottom
Oh, when your love has gone
All you've got to do
Is call me just sometime I think
