When your world is full of strange arrangements
And gravity won't pull you through
You know you're missing out on something
Well that something depends on you


(All I'm saying)
It takes a lot to love you
(All I'm doing)
You know it's true
(All I need now)
There's one thing
Yes, one thing that turns this gray sky to blue


(That's the look, that's the look)
The look of love
(That's the look, that's the look)
The look of love
(That's the look, that's the look)
The look of love


When your girl has left you out on the pavement
(Goodbye)
When your dreams fall apart at the seams
Your reason for living, your reason for leaving
Don't ask me what it means


(Who's got the look?)
I don't know the answer to that question
(Where's the look?)
If I knew I would tell you
(What's the look?)
Look for your information
Yes, there's one thing, one thing that still hold true
(What's that?)


(That's the look, that's the look)
The look of love
(That's the look, that's the look)
The look of love
(That's the look, that's the look)
The look of love




(That's the look, that's the look)
The look of love
(That's the look, that's the look)
The look of love
(That's the look, that's the look)
The look of love
(Look of love)


If you judge a book by the cover
Then you judge the look by the lover
I hope you'll soon recover
Me, I go from one extreme to another


And though my friends just might ask me
They say, "Martin, maybe one day you'll find true love"
I say, "Maybe there must be a solution
To the one thing, the one thing we can't find"


(That's the look, that's the look)
Sisters and brothers
(That's the look, that's the look)
Should help each other
(That's the look, that's the look)
Oh, ohHeavens above
(That's the look, that's the look)
Hip hip hooray
(That's the look, that's the look)
Yippee ai yippee aiay
(That's the look, that's the look)
Be lucky in love
Look of love
