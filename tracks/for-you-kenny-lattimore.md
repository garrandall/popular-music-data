For you I give a lifetime of stablility
Anything you want of me
Nothing is impossible

For you there are no words
Or ways to show my love
Or all the thoughts I'm thinking of

'Cause this life is no good alone
Since we've become one
I've made a change
Everything I do now makes sense
All roads end, all I do is for you

For you I share the cup of love that overflows
And anyone who knows us knows
That I would change all faults I have for you
There is no low or high or in between
Of my heart that you Haven't seen

'Cause I share all I have and am
Nothing I've said is hard to understand
All I feel I feel deeper still
And always will all this love is for you

Every note that I play
Every word I might say
Every melody I feel
Are only for you and your appeal

Every page that I write
Everyday of my life
Would not be filled without the things
That my love for you now brings

For you I'd make a promise of fidelity
Now and for eternity
No one could replace this vow
For you I'd take your hand and heart
And everything and add to them a wedding ring

'Cause this life is no good alone
Since we've become one you're all I know
If this feeling should leave I'd die and here's why
All I am is for you

Everything I do now makes sense
All roads end, all I do...
Is for you
Only for you
