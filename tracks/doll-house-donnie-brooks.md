Got a hammer, nail and a hunka wood
I'll build a doll house
If you marry me the way I think you should
I'll build a doll house
Cutest place you'll ever see
Big enough for you-woo-woo and me
If you say you're gonna love me all the time
I'll build a doll house
Gonna be so happy when it's your and mine
I'll build a doll house
Cutest place you'll ever see
Big enough for you-woo-woo and me
Maybe I can't buy you all you're dreamin' of
But, baby, this I promise you, you'll have lots of love
Got a hammer, nail and a hunka wood
I'll build a doll house
If you marry me the way I think you should
I'll build a doll house
Cutest place you'll ever see
Big enough for you-woo-woo and me
Maybe I can't buy you all you're dreamin' of
But, baby, this I promise you, you'll have lots of love
Got a hammer, nail and a hunka wood
I'll build a doll house
If you marry me the way I think you should
I'll build a doll house
Cutest place you'll ever see
Big enough for you-woo-woo and me
Big enough for you-woo-woo and me
I'll build a doll house!
