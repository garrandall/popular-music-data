Time it goes on waits for nobody special
In the prime of my life I'll remember you
Living and breathing and some misbelieving
But I can't hold you woman, no piece of you
You were the magic, my only believer
My life on the line for you
All that I give to you
Time is time 
Don't give me no time to waste away
Love is love
Keep me alive to my dying day
Now is now
We capture the world
And love will make it all right, all right 

Time it goes on waits for nothing on over
But I still see your sun that you shine on me
Giving and taking and always mistaking
But I'll follow you woman, eternally
You were the magic, my only believer
My life on the line for you
All that I give to you
Time is time
Don't give me no time to waste away
Love is love
Keep me alive to my dying day
Now is now
We capture the world
And love will make it all right, all right 

Setting my sights in one only direction
Searching for romance and showing affection
I guess I better know one, standing in the cold dark
Waiting for your love 

Time is time
Don't give me no wrong in making love
Love is love, turn me around till you burn me up
Now is now, we master the world
And time will make it all right, all right

Time is time
Don't give me no wrong in making love
Love is love, turn me around till you burn me up
Now is now, we master the world
And time will make it all right, all right

Time is time
Don't give me no wrong in making love
Love is love, turn me around till you burn me up
Now is now, we master the world
And time will make it all right, all right

Time is time
Don't give me no wrong in making love
Love is love, turn me around till you burn me up
Now is now, we master the world
And time will make it all right, all right
