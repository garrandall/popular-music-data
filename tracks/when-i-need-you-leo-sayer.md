When I need you
I just close my eyes and I'm with you
And all that I so want to give you
It's only a heartbeat away

When I need love
I hold out my hands and I touch love
I never knew there was so much love
Keeping me warm night and day



Miles and miles of empty space in between us
A telephone can't take the place of your smile
But you know I won't be traveling forever
It's cold out, but hold out and do like I do



When I need you
I just close my eyes and I'm with you
And all that I so want to give you, babe
It's only a heartbeat away



It's not easy when the road is your driver
Honey, that's a heavy load that we bear
But you know I won't be traveling a lifetime
It's cold out, but hold out and do like I do

Oh, I need you



When I need love
I hold out my hands and I touch love
I never knew there was so much love
Keeping me warm night and day



When I need you
I just close my eyes
And you’re right here by my side
Keeping me warm night and day

I just hold out my hand
Just hold out my hand
And I’m with you darling
Yes I’m with you darling
All I want to give you
Is only a heartbeat away

Oh I need you darling
Oh I want you darling
