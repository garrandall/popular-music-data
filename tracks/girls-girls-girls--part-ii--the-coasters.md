Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls
Sitting on the buses (girls)
Getting outta taxis (girls)
Walking and wiggling by (yeah, yeah, yeah, girls)

In tight sweaters (girls)
In short dresses (girls)
So pretty Lord I could cry (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'm just a red-blooded boy and I can't stop singing about
Girls

Going swimming (girls)
Playing tennis (girls)
Skipping around in the park (yeah, yeah, yeah girls)

Riding horses (girls)
And roller skating (girls)
La-ta-ta in the dark (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'm just a red-blooded boy and I can't stop singing about
Girls, girls, girls, girls

And when I pick up a sandwich to munch
A crunchy crunchedy crunchedy crunch
I never ever get to finish my lunch
Because there's always bound to be a bunch of girls

Getting on the buses (girls)
Getting outta taxis (girls)

Walking and wiggling by (yeah, yeah, yeah, girls)

In tight sweaters (girls)
In short dresses (girls)
So pretty Lord I could cry (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'm just a red-blooded boy and I can't stop singing about
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls
(repeat to sax interlude)

I'm just a red-blooded boy and I can't stop singing about
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls
