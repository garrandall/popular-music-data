I woke up early this morning around 4am
With the moon shining bright
As headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head
And tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been trying my best to get along
But that's OK
There's nothing left to say, but


Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me


I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So


Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me


Someday I'm going to run across your mind
Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm going to be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishing I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life


So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and all your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Because we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me, oh


And you're going to think of me
Oh yeah
Ooh someday baby, someday
Oooh ooh ooh oh
Think of me
Ooh ooh dumdum dirumdum baby
