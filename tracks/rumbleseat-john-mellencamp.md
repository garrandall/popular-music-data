All the leaves are green
All my friends are gone
I'm livin' in my hometown
I can barely get along
I feel sorry for myself
That's an easy thing to do
I feel sorry for the world
I feel sorry for you

Yes I am a pitiful sight
I can't even get one thing right

I know just what it's like
To be a rider ridin' in the rumbleseat
Yes I know just what it's like
To be a big time rider in the rumbleseat

Well I could have a nervous breakdown
But I don't believe in shrinks
I should be drunker than a monkey
But I don't like to drink
Call up some girls
But I'm afraid of the phone
I'm always talkin' to myself
I guess I'm never alone

Am I the only one that feels this way
I'd buy myself some stylish clothes but I sure hate to pay

I know just what it's like
To be a rider ridin' in the rumbleseat
Yes I know just what it's like
To be a big time rider in the rumbleseat

The sun is coming up
Just goin' to bed
I combed my hair with my pillow
Still got some dreams left
Tomorrow is a new day
Gonna make these dreams come true
I'm gonna believe in myself
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do

I'm gonna stop puttin' myself down
I'm gonna turn my life around

I'll be ridin' high
With my feet kicked up in the rumbleseat
Yeah we'll go for a drive
And we'll be singin' shotgun from that rumbleseat
Yes I'll blow you a kiss
And we'll be ridin' big time in my rumbleseat
