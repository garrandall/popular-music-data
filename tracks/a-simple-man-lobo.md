Where do butterflies go when it rains?
Who goes around & tucks in the trains?
What makes a teddy bear like to sleep?
Why do we all make promises that we can't keep?

Where do puppy dogs go when their sad?
And what do elephants say when their mad?
Who do you tell if you don't have a friend?
Why do we open our mouths and stick our foot in?

These are the things that bother me,
Not a lot of things across some sea,
I don't even have a master plan,
I guess that I am just a simple man.

Where do robins sleep on the road?
And how can a little ant carry that load?
Why write words that we have to erase?
Why does everyone have more than one face?
