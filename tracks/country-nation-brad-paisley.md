We work in the factories and the fields
Assembly lines, the coal mines
And the steel mills
That's what we do but there's more to us than that
If you wanna know who we are
It's on the logos of our caps

We're Mountaineers, we're Volunteers
We're the Tide that rolls, we're Seminoles
We're a herd of Longhorn steer
We drive Ford and Chevrolet
Cheer 24 and 88
We crank up our music Friday nights
On two thousand country stations
Yeah, we're one big country nation, that's right

We might fix your water pump or your AC
Bring your apple pie and fill your glass of tea
We'll take that FedEx package to your door
But underneath that apron or that uniform

We're Wildcats, we're Wolverines
We're Tigers, Buckeyes, Bruins
Bulldogs, Hogs and Hurricanes
We pray before we race
Cheer 14 and 48
And we drink ice-cold beer on Friday nights
Yeah, we're one big country nation, that's right

We're all across the map, down city streets and old dirt roads
We're the fabric of this nation
And we're a nation all our own

We're Mountaineers, we're Volunteers
Blue Devils, Heels and Rebels
Fighting Irish and Cavaliers
We soup up our Chevrolets
Cheer 24 and 88
We crank up the same songs Friday night
On two thousand country stations
Yeah, we're one big country nation, that's right
