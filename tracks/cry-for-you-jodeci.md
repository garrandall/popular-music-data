Without you baby
I feel worthless
I'm livin on the edge
It's been an hour
Since you've been gone
And that's too long
So come back home
I can't live without you
So i'll cry for you
Do anything that I can
To feel that touch from your hand
Sorry that I want you
Lady what do I do



You know you're everything I do
Oh yeah
Do what you want me to
I would do anything
Get on my knees for you
Oh, baby
What else is there to do
I don't know, I don't know
But i'll cry



Lady i, will cry for you tonight
Tonight
Yeah
Lady i, will cry for you tonight
Tonight

Help me out
Help me out, yeah
You spoil me girl
Like a child
When you're not here I can't even smile
I can't think without you
My mind is always with you
It's amazing what you do
To keep me falling in love with you
Girl you all that I know
Where else can I go

You know you're everything I do
Oh wee
Do what you want me to
Anything you need from me baby
Get on my knees for you
Ohhh, oh
What else is there to do
I don't know, I don't know
But i'll cry

Lady i, will cry for you tonight
Tonight
Lady i, will cry for you tonight
Tonight

Help me out baby
Help me out baby, yes
I don't know what else to say
I don't know what else to say
K-ci help me sing it
Jojo i'm right here yes I am
I will cry for you lady
Sometimes my pillow gets so wet with tears
I don't have no one to call my own
I want you back baby
Oh yeah
Baby i'm beggin, baby i'm beggin, beggin baby x8
Yeahhhhhhhhh
