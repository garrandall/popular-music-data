Wooh
Show time
King's back, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pulling off in a 215
Told you it's Meek time
Meek time, it's Meek time, argh


For the love of the city (for the city)
All my niggas on the block (on the block)
12 o' clock, we ain't wheeling (we ain't wheeling)
Fuck 12 and the cops (fuck 12)
They wanna see me in the cage, I'd rather see me in a Wraith
I'm motivation on the 'gram
I'm going live on these bitches on stage, goddamn
Who love the streets? Meek, Meek
Who dropping heat? Meek, Meek
Who locked the city up, pull up in that Bentley track, rest of them motherfuckers see? Meek
Who dropping shit through the worst? Meek
Who really dropping that fire? Meek
Back on the water, they listen when I speak
Who got the key to the streets? Meek


They was screaming free Meek (yeah), now Meek free, judge tryna hold me (talk to 'em)
Remember back when I was dead broke, pretty bitches, I ain't know 'em (zoom)
Taught these niggas how to post up on jet for the 'gram, busting Rollies (talk to 'em)
'Member that?
I'ma be humble but I need receipts 'cause these niggas up (Philly, stand up)
Nigga, ain't nothin' 'bout me average (woo)
Jumping out the Wraith with a bad bitch (damn)
At the clearport, moonwalking (woo)
Wrist all glitter, Michael Jackson (damn)
Nigga bad, messin' the rachet (gah damn)
Same with the internet capping (gah damn)
When we do a hit, it's a murder
Shit'll get ugly like a catfish
Who came and tripled his worth? Meek
Who shall inherit the Earth? Meek
Who see the plug, get 'em dirt? Chief
I get 'em bad bitches first, thief
Make it rain on 'em, pourin' Champagne on 'em bad bitches do whatever I say, wait
I bought a Rolls Royce just to burn that shit and set that shit on fire, niggas (gah damn)


For the love of the city (for the city) (zoom)
All my niggas on the block (on the block) (zoom)
12 o' clock, we ain't wheeling (we ain't wheeling) (zoom)
Fuck 12 and the cops (fuck 12) (fuck them)
They wanna see me in the cage, I'd rather see me in a Wraith
I'm motivation on the 'gram
I'm going live on these bitches on stage, gah damn
Who love the streets? Meek, Meek
Who dropping heat? Meek, Meek
Who locked the city up, pull up in that Bentley track, rest of them motherfuckers see? Meek
Who dropping shit through the worst? Meek
Who really dropping that fire? Meek
Back on the water, they listen when I speak
Who got the key to the streets? Meek


Who really popping shit? (popping shit)
Came to your city and got it lit? (got it lit)
All of these pretty hoes I done hit (pretty hoes)
You better pray that I got a bitch (got a bitch)
I show no mercy on niggas' hoes (niggas' hoes)
All I gotta do is just like a pic' (woo)
If you a app, I'ma buy your bitch (buy your bitch)
This for the trenches, this's not a hit (woo)
Nigga, I'ma icon living, huh
Jumping on the chopper outta prison, huh
Bunch of supermodels wanna visit, huh
I'ma let her lover get a picture, huh
Aventador, Aventador, Aventador, (skurt, skurt)
Tell you how I came to a kitten (vroom)
I can smell rat niggas snitching (niggas snitching)
Touch down and it's back to the business
Who they say that's dropping that work? Meek
Who hit them bad bitches first? Meek
Who charge 250 a verse? Meek
Who rap and still get you murked? Meek
Cops try put me on the north side of Philly 'cause I'm still popping wheelies like what
New jewelry, new money on the way and I just ordered that Rolls Royce truck, ya dig?

For the love of the city (for the city)
All my niggas on the block (on the block)
12 o' clock, we ain't wheeling (we ain't wheeling)
Fuck 12 and the cops (fuck 12)
They wanna see me in the cage, I'd rather see me in a Wraith
I'm motivation on the 'gram
I'm going live on these bitches on stage, gah damn
Who love the streets? Meek, Meek
Who dropping heat? Meek, Meek
Who locked the city up, pull up in that Bentley track, rest of them motherfuckers see? Meek
Who dropping shit through the worst? Meek
Who really dropping that fire? Meek
Back on the water, they listen when I speak
Who got the key to the streets? Meek

P.H.I. double L Y, he that guy
He never gon' lie, forever be fly
I've been that nigga
I can swear to my god, cross my heart and put that on my mom
I bought her Patek ice, setting the time
Like Kim Jong, I been ready to bomb
I get gone, take a jet to Dubai
You're not a hundred, nigga, 75
You playing big, must be ready to die, nigga for f'ing with I
Meek!
