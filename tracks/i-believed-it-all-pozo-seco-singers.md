Mary had a little lamb
One and one make two
Candles on a birthday cake
Blow them out and your wish comes true

Does he love me, does he not
Tell me daisy do
Oh to be a child again
Oaks from acorns grew
One and one made two
I believed it all
Didn't you?

I remember when every day began
Strawberry jam and laughter
And every story ended
With "happily ever after"
I remember feeling that I'd be safe
If I didn't step on a crack
The days when the sun is up ahead
And the wind is at my back

Does he love me, does he not
Tell me daisy do
Oh to be a child again
Oaks from acorns grew
One and one made two
I believed it all
Didn't you?
Didn't you?
