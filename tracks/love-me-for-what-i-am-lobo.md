I wore the clothes you like
You said they gave me that look
I even tried to like the food
I know you like to cook
I parted my hair on the left
I carried your arm on the right
I slept late in the morning
And stayed out late at night

I can't give anymore of my soul away
And still look myself in the mirror everyday
I can't change anymore of what makes me be myself
And still have enough left not to be somebody else
I'm not demanding as a man
Just asking you love me for what I am

I tried hard not to say the things you don't like to hear
And when to you it was apropos I nibbled on your ear
I open the door up for you, I keep my big mouth shut
But I've been moving down while you been going up
