And we don't stop, no ma
What's the problem?
Always complain
When there's chic's that are starving
What type of game is this?
I used to support ya
I thought ya'd appreciate
Some of the things that I bought ya
Shoes from Milan, Luis Vuitton
Animal arm bag
And jewels in your arm
Mamie, that's nothin'
Moves with the dawn
Loon a big fish
Leave them fools in the pond


Just when I made up my mind, I don't want you at all out, oh now
You had your chance you owned me, what makes you wanna call now?
Can you try and tell me what made you choose her as your friend?
(I told you it was a friend baby)
Just when I think you've given up, it's you again.
All I can sayâ¦

Farewell my lonely one
Nothing else you can deny (so hit the freeway)
I don't ever wanna see you again
You didn't do me right so
So long, goodbye, goodnight (so hit the freeway)
Maybe in some other life
I'll see you again.

I would've bet the Dow Jones, it didn't compare to our fun, yeah
Imagine how crushing it was for you to say that I was not the one
(I didn't mean it girl, sorry about that)
My friends say I was in denial defending you as a perfect friend
Now rumors have raisen up, it's you again
All I can say

Farewell my lonely one
Nothing else you can deny (so hit the freeway)
I don't ever wanna see you again (Sing it girl)
You didn't do me right so
So long, goodbye, goodnight (so hit the freeway)
Maybe in some other life
I'll see you again.


But now that you left me
Crazy you upset me
You know you could have kept me
But baby you didn't get me on
To finally discover
Explore, uncover
The world as we know it
But you had to go and blow it

Damn it's been so long since I heard your voice voice last summer
To be honest it made me smile, when I seen your number
(hey baby, you know I miss you, ha ha)
Baby, tell me what I should be instead of being your friend (you know)
And maybe someday in your dreams my love
You could say, "Damn it's you again!"
Now all I can say â¦ 

Farewell my lonely one
Nothing else you can't deny (so hit the freeway)
I don't ever wanna see you again (don't wanna see you)
You didn't do me right so
So long, goodbye, goodnight (so hit the freeway)
Maybe in some other life
I'll see you again.
