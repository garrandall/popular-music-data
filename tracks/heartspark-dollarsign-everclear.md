Time stops when the whispers blare
The voices drop hard, but the eyes still stare
The world resolves into a death's head grin
Because I walk with pride with a black girlfriend
My mom said not to bring her around
'Cause she's black my family would put her down
I'll break the white-trash ties that bind
Trade a love so pure for a hate so blind
She said, she said
Forget the fact that I don't look like you
She said, she said
You're possessed with a power
Bigger than the pain
Time stops when we lie so close
In my room where we share what no one knows
From the day that we start
Until the day that we end
I know I know I know now
We will never find a place where we can just fit in
Me and my black girlfriend
She said, she said
Fend for yourself, you're alone
She said, she said
You are possessed with a power
Bigger than the pain
A power bigger than the pain
