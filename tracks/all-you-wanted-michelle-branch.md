I wanted to be like you
I wanted everything
So I tried to be like you
And I got swept away
I didn't know that it was so cold
And you needed someone to show you the way
So I took your hand and we figured out that
When the tide comes, I'd take you away


If you want to
I can save you
I can take you away from here
So lonely inside
So busy out there
And all you wanted was somebody who cares


I'm sinking slowly
So hurry, hold me
Your hand is all I have to keep me hanging on
Please, can you tell me?
So I can finally see
Where you go when you're gone


If you want to
I can save you
I can take you away from here
So lonely inside
So busy out there
And all you wanted was somebody who cares


All you wanted was somebody who cares
If you need me, you know I'll be there
Oh-oh, whoa, yeah


If you want to
I can save you
I can take you away from here (I can take you away)
So lonely inside
So busy out there
And all you wanted was somebody who cares
Oh, whoa
(And all you wanted was somebody who cares)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
If you want to (If you want to)
I can save you (Oh)
I can take you away from here (I can take you away)
So lonely inside
So busy out there
And all you wanted was somebody who cares


Please, can you tell me?
So I can finally see
Where you go when you're gone
