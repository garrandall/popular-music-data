What are you doing out there baby
Messin' 'round with all the guys
What are you doing out there playing
Aren't you supposed to be mine
What are you doing out there baby
That ain't the way it's supposed to be
Because, you're, you're supposed to keep your love for me

What are you doing out there sugar
Trying to bring my spirit down
Because I've heard that you've been sneaking
Around with every guy in town
What are you doing out there baby
You're acting like you're fancy free
When, you're, you're supposed to keep your love for me
(so keep your love for me)
Da da da da da da da da da da da

Sooner or later I'm gonna leave you
Though I've said this many times before
And on the day you least expect it
You'll find me walking out the door
What are you doing out there baby
I guess our love will never be
Because, you, you don't wanna keep your love for me
(say it one more time)
You, you don't wanna keep your love for me
(when all the time)
You're, you're supposed to keep your love for me
Da da da da da da da da da da da ('til end)
