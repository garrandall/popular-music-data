Look at Granny run, run
Grandpa runnin' close behind
Look at Granny run, run
There's something on Granddaddy's mind


He went to the doctor, got a brand new pill
The doctor said, "Son, you ain't over the hill"
Now he can't sit still
Great, gosh, almighty, won't you


Look at Granny go go
Faster than a Greyhound bus
Look at Granny go, go
Now Grandpa's gettin' serious


He woke up in the middle of the night
Said, "Look-a here baby, everything's alright"
There were such a fright
Great, gosh, almighty
Won't you look at Granny run, run

Look at Granny run, run
But Grandpa's gettin' closer now
No matter how she run, run
He's gonna catch her anyhow


He said, "Mama, stop your carryin' on
All I wants a little love before I'm gone
Ain't a-nothing wrong"
Great gosh a-mighty


Won't you look at Granny run, run
Look at Granny run, run
Ah look at Granny run, run
Look at Granny run, run
