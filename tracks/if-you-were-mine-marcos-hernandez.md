If you were mine,
I'd be your everything and you'd be the only thing that I would ever need
If you were mine,
I would tell everyone that you are the only one that I could ever want

Ohhh Yeaaa
Everything I dreamed about
Everything that I talked about
One thing I can't live without
I wanna get closer to you
Can't stand being far away
Knowing that you don't feel the same way
watching him bring tears to your eyes


If you were mine,
I'd be your everything and you be the only thing that I would ever need
If you were mine,
I would tell everyone that you are the only one that I could ever want

Ohhh Yeaaa
All words I sing about
All the letters I write about
Only thing I wanna hear about
Is when I get closer to you
I know that there is someone else, but he's only thinking of himself
Doesn't make any sense for you to be lonely


If you were mine,
I'd be your everything and you be the only thing that I would ever need
If you were mine,
I would tell everyone that you are the only one that I could ever want

Ohhh Yeaaa
Let me be the one you share your hopes and dreams with
You'll never be alone again, cuz' I will hold you endlessly
Please don't be afraid to let your broken heart guide you
Into these open arms that long to surround you, baby!


If you were mine,
I'd be your everything and you be the only thing that I would ever need
If you were mine,
I would tell everyone that you are the only one that I could ever want
