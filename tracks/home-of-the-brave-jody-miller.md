Home Of The Brave
Jody Miller
(B. Mann-C. Weil)
The school board says "he can't come to school, no more"
Unless he wears his hair like he wore it before
The PTA and all the mothers, say he ought to look like the others
Home of the brave, land of the free
Why won't you let him be what he wants to be
The kids all laugh at his hair and funny clothes
And more than once he's gone home with a bloody nose
He's not like them and they can't ignore it. So they all hate him for it
Home of the brave, land of the free
Why won't you let him be what he wants to be
It really burns me up, when they put him down
He's the only one whose saying something in this whole town
Instead of those the trouble they hand him, why don't they try to understand him
Home of the brave, land of the free
Why won't you let him be what he wants to be
He never hurt nobody
Why won't you let him be what he wants to be
He just a little bit different
Why won't you let him be what he wants to be
You got to understand him
Why won't you let him be what he wants to be
And are for personal use and research interest only
