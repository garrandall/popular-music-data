Look at you, look at me,
Look at all the things you doubt now.
That's not how love should be,
Baby, let it all come out now.
Some people say there are games you should play, but it's not true.
Don't waste your time; there's no rhyme; love is blind so we got to
Trust each other in love
And we can't stop believing for a single day.
We got to trust each other in love.
Oh, take my hand, can't you see it's the only way?

Look at me, look at you,
If you open up your eyes, girl.
You will find love is true
And it has no room for lies, girl.
When you're in love there are things to think of that you can't do.
Don't be in doubt; talk it out; that's about all you can do.
Trust each other in love
And we can't stop believing for a single day.
We got to trust each other in love.
Oh, take my hand, can't you see it's the only way?

Trust each other in love
And we can't stop believing for a single day.
We got to trust each other in love.
Oh, take my hand, can't you see it's the only way?
