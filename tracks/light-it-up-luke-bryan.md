I open my eyes, reach for the phone
Not a word from you baby
It don’t leave my sight since we had that fight
Can’t remember but maybe
I blew you up
In the middle of the night again
You were drinking with your friends
You ignored it but you got it


I get so neurotic about it baby
‘Cause I know you’re reading your phone
I can’t help from going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it, I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck
And I almost wreck it
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you’re looking for my love
Then light it up


Every time I unlock my screen
I hope I see one of them red lipstick ‘I miss you’ pictures
I’m on your clock, you’re in control
You want me now baby go figure
My worlds at the tips of your fingers


I get so neurotic about it baby
‘Cause I know you’re reading your phone
I can’t help from going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it, I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck
And I almost wreck it
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you’re looking for my love
Then light it up
Yeah baby, then light it up


I go to sleep, I check it
In the middle of the night, I check it
I feel the buzz in my bed
And I don’t get no rest
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you’re looking for my love
Then light it up
Yeah baby, light it up
