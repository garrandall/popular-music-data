Well, there's a certain girl I've been in love with a long, long time
What's her name? I can't tell you (Ahh...)
I can't reveal her name until she's mine
What's her name? I can't tell you (Ahh...)
I've tried to make her time and time again
Still we're introduced as nothing but friends
And there's a certain girl I've been in love with a long, long time
What's her name? I can't tell you (Ahh...)

There's a certain chick I've been sweet on since I met her
What's her name? I can't tell you (Ahh...)
I can't reveal her name until I get her
What's her name? I can't tell you (Ahh...)
Someday I'm gonna wake up and say
I'll do anything just to be your slave
And there's a certain girl I've been in love with a long, long time
What's her name? I can't tell you (Ahh...)

There's a certain girl I've been in love with a long, long time
What's her name? I can't tell you (Ahh...)
I can't reveal her name until she's mine
What's her name? I can't tell you (Ahh...)
I've tried to make her time and time again
Still we're introduced as nothing but friends
And there's a certain girl I've been in love with a long, long time
What's her name? I can't tell you (Ahh...)
