The love that I gave you
See, I was a slave to
I was your savior
Now nothing can save you

Paved the way for the
Road straight to heartbreak
Shaved my love like a bad
Near a hot date

You played me out
Like a shirt that you overwear
Thought you were there
But I knew that you didn't care

Why was I surprised by
Your lies that patronize
I fell in love with a
Face and pretty eyes

A pretty face comes
A dozen a dime
Listen to the rhyme
And you will know in time

Yesterday is gone
You have to live for tomorrow
How can I survive
On a love that is borrowed

What could make me think
That I could live on borrowed love
Now I see that I could never
Live on borrowed love

It's 3:01 in the morning
Another sleepless night
I feel your presence with me
And it doesn't feel right

And then it starts
Flowing through me
From my feet
Right to my head

Then I scream
Calling out your name
I want you back in my bed
My bed, ooh, ooh

What could make me think
That I could live on borrowed love
(Borrowed love)
Now I see (now I see) that I
Could never live on borrowed love

Like a drummer always beating
The inside of my soul
Here's this feeling always seeking
The touch they knew so well
In the places that matter

What could make me think
That I could live on borrowed love
(On borrowed love)
Now I see (now I see) that I
Could never live on borrowed love

Hip hip hooray
You say like Michael J
That you want me back
You lack the knack
To get me back in the sack

All of us will and that's a fact
But you're a small fry
And I'm a Big Mac

Please, you put me back
Now on hands and knees
And it's my body that
You want to please

It was all a big tease
Now walk out the door
And leave me the key

What could make me think
That I could live on borrowed love
Now I see that I could never
Live on borrowed love

I can't eat, I can't sleep
Thinking 'bout who you're with
Are you happy making me crazy
You were the best I ever had

What could make me think
That I could live on borrowed love
(On borrowed love)
Now I see (now I see) that I
Could never live on borrowed love
(Borrowed love)

What could make me think
That I could live on borrowed love
(On borrowed, borrowed love)
Now I see (now I see) that I
Could never live on borrowed love
(Borrowed love)

What could make me think
That I could live on borrowed love
(Never love)
Now I see that I could never
Live on borrowed love
