Been through a lot of pain in my life, and I pray the Lord take it all away
I got family doing life, never see the sunshine again and pray it all away
We all the way!

Diamond teeth when I bless the game, I was bein' quiet but got a lot to say
Unique chains on a freeway, don't need reigns, cocaine Wraith
Made a statement, I was grindin' on 'em, got an order off, want a replay?
Rolex, no diamonds in it, Swiss movement, no time for tickin'
Introverted, not tryna kick it, private life, please mind your business
Introverted, these days, introverted, these days
Plain Jane, I done changed lanes, Plain Jane, I done changed lanes
Plain Jane, I done changed lanes, Plain Jane, I done changed lanes

Making Salat, I ain't miss a beat
Praise to Allah, made it out the clink
Alhamdulillah, praise be to God
Big booty freak, givin' a massage
Lookin' in the mirror, lookin' at a star
She get on her knees and look up at a star
Remember being broke, wishin' on a star
Out the mud no one givin' us a star
White gold, iced out, Audemars
Foreign car, push button, autostart
Rest and relaxation not involved, goin' hard Rolls Royce, R&R
Wonder why these niggas hate me?
Probably 'cause they know they ain't me
I ain't never been a gang member, Illinois labeled me a gang chief
Political spear, Judge Linehan racist, I'm bein' sentenced
Wrongful conviction, broke bread and lied to me
Gave him a quarter ticket, he did not appeal it
Layin' in my cell, lookin' at the ceiling
I'm on a division, me and all the killers
Throwin' shit and piss on all the staff members
Even got the warden, that's why they had to ship us

Diamond teeth when I bless the game, I was bein' quiet but got a lot to say
Unique chains on a freeway, don't need reigns, cocaine Wraith
Made a statement, I was grindin' on 'em, got an order off, want a replay?
Rolex, no diamonds in it, Swiss movement, no time for tickin'
Introverted, not tryna kick it, private life, please mind your business
Introverted, these days, introverted, these days
Plain Jane, I done changed lanes, Plain Jane, I done changed lanes
Plain Jane, I done changed lanes, Plain Jane, I done changed lanes

(Vroom Vroom) This a Camaro
I'm rockin' Bread Winners' fitness apparel
Sexy receptionist look like a dancer
Pardon me ma'am, I'm demandin' some answers
Not makin' plans that was made to be cancelled
Coulda said, "Hi," you know I'm kinda bashful
Unwillin' to fuck with me, why you starin'?
Got some real niggas and we into sharin'
Conservative aura, I glow in the dark
I speak in no English, I'm talkin' numerics
Islamic fashion out in Paris, overseas when I travel, McLaren
Come to think this was me in the alley
Mickie D's we was purchasin' salads
Chi-raq, buyin' chicken from Harold's
Jerk Villa curry chicken and cabbage
Fresh yams, politic'n with family
I got status, gotta catch me in traffic
Makin' music, but I'm really a trapper
Booty club, 'bout to fuck up a sandwich
A hundred bands, if you ain't catch him, what's happenin'?
They see what I see, told him we platinum
Amsterdam on the tram, we in transit
Word to God, I'ma fuck a Kardashian

Diamond teeth when I bless the game, I was bein' quiet but got a lot to say
Unique chains on a freeway, don't need reigns, cocaine Wraith
Made a statement, I was grindin' on 'em, got an order off, wanna replay?
Rolex, no diamonds in it, Swiss movement, no time for tickin'
Introverted, not tryna kick it, private life, please mind your business
Introverted, these days, introverted, these days
Plain Jane, I done changed lanes, Plain Jane, I done changed lanes
Plain Jane, I done changed lanes, Plain Jane, I done changed lanes
