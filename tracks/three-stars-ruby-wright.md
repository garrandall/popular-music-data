Look up in the sky
Up to one who knows
There are three new stars
Brightly shining forth

They're shining so bright
From heaven above
Gee, we're gonna miss you
Everybody sends their love

On the left stands Ritchie Valens
A young boy, just seventeen
Just beginning to realize and explore
All his teenage dreams

Why did God call him
Oh so far away
Maybe to help some boy or girl who
Might have gone astray

With his star shining
Through the dark and lonely night
To light the path and show the way
The way that's right

Gee, we're gonna miss you
Everybody sends their love
On the right stands Buddy Holly

With a shy grin on his face
Funny how you always seem to notice that
One little curl out of place

Not many people really knew Buddy or
Understood how he felt
But just a song from his lips
Would make the coldest heart melt

Buddy's singing for God now and
His in the sky
Buddy Holly, we'll always remember you
With tears in our eyes

Gee, we're gonna miss you
Everybody sends their love

In the middle stands a stout man
The Big Bopper is his name
Now God has called him
Perhaps to new fortune and fame

He wore a big Stetson hat
And sort of rambled up to the mike
And how can we ever forget those wonderful words
You know what I like

Look up in the sky
Up to one who knows
There are three new stars
Brightly shining forth

They're shining so bright
From heaven above
Gee we're gonna miss you
Everybody sends their love
