Can I get some nasty bass?
It's gonna be kinda right tonight!
Fellas! (Yeah!) we gonna talk about a girl who's fake!
Fellas, can I get you to put your hands together for that?
Come on!

Patty, Patty!


Your name was Patty, but now it's Kay
Girl, you seem to change it every day
Your hair was long but now it's short
You say "I got it cut!" but I don't see no hair upon the floor
Whenever I go out with you I find out something new


You're a fake, baby
You can't conceal it
Know how I know?
'Cause I can feel it
You're a fake, baby
No rhyme or reason
'Cause in your mind
It's lying season


You had brown eyes, but now they're blue
Those false eyelashes that you're wearin' too
In bed this morning, you called me CIyde
Alex is the name that I go by!
If women could be counterfeit
Then you'd be it


You're a fake, baby
You can't conceal it
Know how I know?
'Cause I can feel it
You're a fake, baby
I've blown your cover
The iig is up
'Cause I discovered


You're a fake, baby
No need to hide it
Can't change my mind
'cause I've decided
You're a fake, baby
And I'm disgusted
The game is through
And girl, you're busted

Fake!

Whenever I go out with you I find out something new
You're a fake
You always have a good excuse
But girl that ain't no use



You're a fake
Baby
Fake
Fake!

Running round and running round... fake
Dirty, nasty, low down, sleazy fake
Fake is the word!
