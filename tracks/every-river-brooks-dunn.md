Once upon a time
Somewhere in your past
Someone said forever
But that promise didn't last

Now you don't believe
Love is ever true
Steel yourself against the day
When I stopped loving you

When the day comes that I don't love you
Every star will fall out of the sky
And every mountain will tumble down
And every river run dry

For every drop of rain
That ever touched the ground
For every tear that ever fell
And never made a sound

I'll be there
To hear you call
And I'll be there to catch you baby
Should you ever fall


And every river run dry
