Fee fi for fum
For fumma, for fumma

A sweet little kiss
When we embrace
A pretty little smile
That's always on your face

Some cute little shoes
To make your feet look neat
Some pretty little dancing steps
From your little feet

And that's all (that's all)
That's all (that's all)
All I want (that's all I want)

A pretty little wiggle
Baby, when you walk
A pretty little giggle
Baby, when you talk

A pretty little wrinkle
Baby, in your smile
A pretty little twinkle
Baby, in your eye

And that's all (that's all)
That's all (that's all)
All I want (that's all I want)

Well, a pretty little dress
To make you show your size
A cute little smirk
Instead of all of the guys

Some pretty little words
That say that I'm your man
My pretty little wedding ring
On your left hand

That's all, that's all
That's all I want

Well, a pretty little dress
To make you show your size
A cute little smirk
Instead of all of the guys

Some pretty little words
That say that I'm your man
My pretty little wedding ring
On your left hand

A pretty little dimple
Baby, in your cheek
A pretty little dress
To make you look so neat

A pretty little voice
To make you sound so fine
Some cute little words that
Says you're mine, all mine

That's all (that's all)
That's all (that's all)
All I want (that's all I want)
