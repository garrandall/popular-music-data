Gloria, my Gloria
Things ain't been the same since you've been away yeah
Gloria, my Gloria
I don't wanna see, another day

Seems like only yesterday
I beheld your sweet face
And in my lonely room are memories
Of your embrace

Gloria, my Gloria
Things ain't been the same since you been away, yeah, yeah
Gloria, oh baby
I don't wanna see another day

Isn't it funny, how time can change
All the things you once believed
But time won't change, the way I feel
Cause in my mind, it's still you and me
You and me

Gloria, my Gloria, yeah
Things ain't been the same since you been away, yeah, yeah

Gloria, oh baby I don't wanna see
Another day

I don't wanna see, naw, another day
Without your love, I don't wanna see, no, another day
It's a real sad thing, but I, oh I
Don't wanna see another day
Without your love I don't wanna see, no, another day
It's gonna hurt me but I, don't wanna see
Not another day
Don't wanna see

Something strange is happening
You don't belong to me anymore it seems
I'm all alone in my dreams, yeah
I just feel so weak
No one knows the pain I see, when I'm all alone
Now that you're gone

My world is cold, my friends are few
Without you here my joy seems cruel
And when you left you took all of me
What can I do?

It's you that I need, baby baby
It's you that I need, I'm lonely
It's you that I need, come on baby
Come back home

It's you that I need
It's you that I need
It's you that I need right now
It's you that I need yeah, yeah

Baby baby it's you that I need 
Baby baby

Baby baby it's you that I need 
Baby baby

Baby baby it's you that I need
