Whoa, can't you see that she's mine?
We've been together for a long, long time
And yet they try so very hard
To pull us apart
But we don't care what they say
We're gonna keep our lovin' this way
But if they break us up
You know it'll only break my heart

And don't you know I love her so?
And I'll never, never let her go
No matter what the people may say
Or try to do
'Cause can't you see that she's mine
We've been together for a long, long time
And it'll stay that way
Because I know she'll love me too

People talk and try to break us up
When they know they don't understand
But I don't care what the people may say
I'm gonna keep on holdin' her hand

Can't you see that she's mine?
We've been together for a long, long time
And yet they try so very hard
To pull us apart
But we don't care what they say
We're gonna keep our lovin' this way
But if they break us up
You know it'll only break my heart

Don't you know I love her so?
And I'll never, never let her go
No matter what the people may say
Or try to do
'Cause can't you see that she's mine
We've been together for a long, long time
And it'll stay that way
Because I know she'll love me too
And it'll stay that way
Because I know she'll love me too
