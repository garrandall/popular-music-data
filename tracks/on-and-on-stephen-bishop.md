Down in Jamaica
They got lots of pretty women
Steal your money
Then they break your heart
Lonesome Sue, she's in love with ol' Sam
Take him from the fire into the frying pan


On and on
She just keeps on trying
And she smiles when she feels like crying
On and on, On and on, On and on


Poor ol' Jimmy
Sits alone in the moonlight
Saw his woman kiss another man
So he takes a ladder
Steals the stars from the sky
Puts on Sinatra and starts to cry


On and on
He just keeps on trying
And he smiles when he feels like crying
On and on, On and on, On and on


When the first time is the last time
It can make you feel so bad
But if you know it, show it
Hold on tight
Don't let her say goodnight


Got the sun on my shoulders
And my toes in the sand
Woman's left me for some other man
Aw, but I don't care
I'll just dream and stay tan
Toss up my heart and see where it lands


On and on
I just keep on trying
And I smile when I feel like dying
On and on
On and on
On and on


On and on
On and on
On and on

On and on
On and on
On and on
