It's hard to find the perfect time to say something
You know is gonna change everything
Living with the shame, it ain't nothing like the pain that I saw on her face
Now me and my pile of things
That she throw out the window
Drowning next to me
No seven years of good can't hide the one night I forgot to wear that ring


So let it rain, let it pour, cause she don't love me anymore
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve
Let it come down on me, let it come down on me, let it rain


Last thing I remember was the unfamiliar taste of someone on my lips
It's too late to turn around
When the shades start coming down
The guilt you feel is the last thing on your mind


So let it rain, let it pour, cause she don't love me anymore
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me, let it rain

So let it rain, let it pour, cause she don't love me anymore
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve, just let it come down on me
Let it come down on me, let it rain
Oh let it rain, ohlet it rain, just let it rain, just let it rain, oohet it rain
