Aww, get down with it
Baby, please don't quit it
It won't be long
Before the real nitty gritty

Some like it hot
And some like it cold
Not too young
Certainly not too old

Get what you can
Is the name of the game
But, oh baby
We're doing our thing, yeah

I know it's good, you do too
And it's gonna get better
Before we're through

It's what you wanted
But not so fast
The slower you do it
The longer it's gonna last

And after while
We'll join the whole gang
Right now, right now
Oh baby, doing our thing

It's so nice
When you have someone
What two can do
Is a whole lotta fun

When I get started
I don't know how to quit, ha ha
And when I get tired
I don't know how to sit

Look at me, I feel no pain
Cause, oh baby
Doing our thing, oh, yeah

We're doing our thing
Nobody but you and me
And I like it like that
Just doing our thing

You better get
Yourself somebody, y'all
And start doing your thing
Cause I'm doing my thing

No, no, nobody
But me and my baby
We're doing our thing
And I like it like that
