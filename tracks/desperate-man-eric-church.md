Boo boo
Boo boo boo boo, boo boo boo
Boo boo boo boo, boo boo boo
Boo boo boo boo boo

I've seen the Joshua Tree
Got down on my knees
Threw the Virgin Mother a prayer
I've walked glass barefooted
Strolled 'cross the devil's hot coal
I've tried everything, I swear

Oh but hey (hey), what can I say?
I'm a desperate man
I said hey (hey), what can I say?
I'm just a desperate man

Boo boo
Boo boo boo boo, boo boo boo
Boo boo boo boo, boo boo boo
Boo boo boo boo boo

Fortuneteller told me
"No more last chances
You got no future at all"
Oh but I ain't listenin'
To black-hearted gypsy
Then a crucifix to a bedroom wall

But hey (hey), what can I say?
I'm a desperate man
I said hey (hey), what can I say?
I'm just a desperate man

Boo boo
Boo boo boo boo, boo boo boo
Boo boo boo boo, boo boo boo
Boo boo boo boo boo

Boo boo
Boo boo boo boo, boo boo boo
Boo boo boo boo, boo boo boo
Boo boo boo boo boo

I'm a half-cock, full-tilt, scarred-hands-to-the-hilt, don't-push-me grown-ass man
Yeah flashin' light, caution, careful where ya cross son, 'til she comes back again

But now hey (hey), what can I say?
I'm a desperate man
Oh hey (hey), what can I say?
I'm just a desperate man

Oh hey (hey), I said hey (hey)
Woah what can I say, I'm a desperate man
Oh hey (hey), I said hey (hey)
I'm just a desperate man

Boo boo
Boo boo boo boo, boo boo boo
Boo boo boo boo, boo boo boo
Boo boo boo boo boo

Grown-ass man

Boo boo
Boo boo boo boo, boo boo boo
Boo boo boo boo, boo boo boo
Boo boo boo boo boo

Boo boo
Boo boo boo boo, boo boo boo
Boo boo boo boo, boo boo boo
Boo boo boo boo boo
