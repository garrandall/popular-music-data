Livin' with my eyes closed, goin' day to day
I never knew the difference, I never cared either way
Lookin' for a reason, searchin' for a sign
Reachin' out with both hands, I gotta feel the kick inside

All fired up
(Now I believe there comes a time)
All fired up
(When everything just falls in line)
All fired up
(We live an' learn from our mistakes)
All fired up, fired up, fired up, hey

Ain't nobody livin' in a perfect world
And everybody's out there, cryin' to be heard
And now I got a new fire, burnin' in my eyes
Lightin' up the darkness, movin' like a meteorite

All fired up
(Now I believe there comes a time)
All fired up
(When everything just falls in line)
All fired up
(We live an' learn from our mistakes)
All fired up, fired up, fired up
(The deepest cuts are healed by faith)

Now I believe there comes a time
When everything just falls in line
We live an' learn from our mistakes
The deepest cuts are healed by faith

Now I believe there comes a time
When everything just falls in line
We live an' learn from our mistakes
The deepest cuts are healed by faith

Now I believe there comes a time
When everything just falls in line
We live an' learn from our mistakes
The deepest cuts are healed by faith

Now I believe there comes a time
When everything just falls in line
We live an' learn from our mistakes
The deepest cuts are healed by faith
Now I believe

All fired up
(Now I believe there comes a time)
All fired up
(When everything just falls in line)
All fired up
(We live an' learn from our mistakes)
All fired up, fired up, fired up, hey
(The deepest cuts are healed by faith)

Now I believe there comes a time
When everything just falls in line
We live an' learn from our mistakes
The deepest cuts are healed by faith
