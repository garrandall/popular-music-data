I never waited on a miracle
There ainât no miracles round here
There ainât no miraclesâ¦
Iâm not afraid of the impossible
There ainât impossible round here
There ainât impossible, no


I ain't afraid, knowinâ shitâs gotta change
One day itâll never be the same
Just look into my heart you can see the grind
Look into my eyes you can see the pain
Painted a perfect picture where I came from
Some nights when I thought I wouldnât see the sun
Son raised, though daddy wasnât home, word
Hard tryna hold it down like a short skirt
Skurr off from these niggas tryna hold me back
I will not lose, Hov told me that
Dreaming bout a moment thatâll change my life
I donât never wanna wake up, turn off the lights
Gotta let it burn, Iâve been ready to ignite
I said nothingâs impossible
See me runnin through the city, no obstacles
No option two, one way to go




I ainât afraid, itâs nothing more I gotta say
To them haters middle finger, up to yo face
Facing so many problems, hate being tested
From a place where they waiting to see me arrested
No rest, tryna make it where I wanna go
Alumni but I couldnât make the honor roll
Too cool for school, Iâm too rude with you
Thereâs no rules in the life we choose
I gotta ride for something, gotta die for something
Say you only live once, weâll I keep it 100
Mo money, mo problems keep on coming
Tryin, a nigga go back but these niggas keep frontin
Right now everything going right, it could fuck up tonight though
Said nothingâs impossible
See me runnin through the city, no obstacles
No option two, one way to go




I ainât afraid, Iâm already dead
I just donât know when we goin
Itâs crazy how the devil gets us when we heaven-sent
My hands already red, I lost so many men
Heavy is the head that bares the crown that Iâm wearin man
I was a loser just tryna fit and I let em in
But those were school days, I grew up, now Iâm on Letterman
I never thought that a song I wrote in a minivan
Would ever have the impact Iâm reading inside these letters man
Dear Kells I heard yo story and felt it man
Your voice inspires, I feel like I can do anything
By the way, I sent you something from my brother
Open it up, a razor felt, it was a cutter, damn!
What if you were me, in 2003?
Rap was just a dream black jeans, burning blank CDâs, feed em to the streets
Would you let adversity as you are, come for money
Guys you all realize everything you needâs inside you
