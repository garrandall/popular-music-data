We met at a ski lodge
And we fell in love

Right by a fireplace
We shared
Our first embrace
And then inside my heart
I felt a fire start
It's gonna snow outside
The weather will be cold
But I'm gonna be warm
This winter
Uh-huh-huh

Each time
Your lips touch mine
They taste
Like sparkling wine
I feel so warm a glow
Just 'cause
I love you so
It's cozy in your arms
I'm yours
To have and to hold
And I'm gonna be warm
This winter

Ice skating
On a frozen lake
Sleigh-riding down
A mountainside
Roasting popcorn
Dancing till the dawn
That was how I knew love
Was born-born-born-born

It's just like make-believe
Each night is New Year's Eve
Each day is Christmas Day
You make me feel this way
It's gonna snow outside
The weather will be cold
But I'm gonna be warm
This winter

It's gonna snow outside
The weather will be cold
But I'm gonna be warm
This winter
Whoa, whoa, whoa, honey
Make me warm this winter
Mmmm, baby
Make me warm this winter

Whoa, whoa, whoa
I'll be warm this winter
