(Ooh, ooh...)

Oh, honey, can't you see
How happy we could be
In harmony

Come on and tell me why
Can't we live in harmony
Come on and tell me why
Can't we live in harmony

I lit up my love for you
Now lit up your love for me
In harmony

Our love never
Seems to harmonize
You're always telling me
All those lies

Well, honey, can't you see
How happy we could be
In harmony

It might be true
That we never meant to be
In fate's little book?
Two part harmony

Come on and tell me, ooh...
Ooh, ooh...

Honey, can't you see
How happy we could be
In harmony

Oh, honey, can't you see
How happy we could be
In harmony

Oh, honey, can't you see
How happy we could be
In harmony
