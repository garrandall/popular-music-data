Bobie Doll and Big Jim Picato
Call me up every single day
They don't work and they don't want to
Come on down to some Damn Cafe

Bobie Doll tells me "live in the moment"
Don't get too far ahead - don't live in the past
I blink my eyes and the moment is over
I guess another day has passed

But it's just another day
It's just another day
Watching girls on the street
Well, that's alright with me
And it's just another day

Bobie Doll and Big Jim Picato
Always there with their free advice
They've got pearl handled pistols underneath their vests
They want me to go out drinkin with them tonight

But it's just another day
It's just another day
Watchin girls on the street
Well, that's alright with me
And it's just another day

You've got clean white sheets in the mornin'
Conversation all afternoon
Bobie Doll and Big Jim Picato, baby
And me and you

But, it's just another day
Just another day
Watching girls on the street
Well, that's alright with me
And it's just another day

Well it's just another day
It's just another day
Watching girls on the street
Well, that's alright with me
And it's just another day
