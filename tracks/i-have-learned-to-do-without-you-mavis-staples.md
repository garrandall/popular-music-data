You gave me my first taste of love
You put in a groove and I could think of
Were your sweet lips
Upon my face
Your tender voice I thought I could never erase

Although you're gone
And I'm all alone
In an unhappy home

I have learned to do without you
Even though, even though it hurts inside
I have learned to do without you
I've wiped those tears from my eyes

I'm not perfect, boy, I know it's true
But all my intentions were good for you
My true love and affection, it just wouldn't do
So you found yourself, found somebody new

Now that you're gone
And I'm all alone
In an un, in an un, in an unhappy home

Oh, I have learned to do without you
Even though, even though it hurts me deep down inside
Somehow, I have learned, learned
Learned to do without you
I have wiped all the tears from my eyes

Now that you've had
Had your round of ruse
You realized just how good
How good I was to you
You've come back
To my front door
But it's too late, it's too late, it's too late
I just don't need you no more

So baby, go
Go and leave me alone
In this un, in this un, in this unhappy home
'Cause you know what?

I have learned
Learned to do without you
I have learned to do without you
I'm doing just fine
Oh, by myself
Go on back to your new love
I don't need you
I don't need you no more
'Cause I have learned, learned
Learned to live without you
Yes I have
Somehow I got over you, yeah
Did something I didn't think I could do
I have learned to do without you
I'm doing just fine
