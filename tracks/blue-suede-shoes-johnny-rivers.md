Well, it's one for the money, two for the show
Three to get ready, now go, cat, go
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything, but lay off of my blue suede shoes

You can knock me down, step on my face
Slander my name all over the place
Do anything that you wanna do
But uh uh, honey, lay off of my shoes
You can do anything, but lay off of my blue suede shoes

You can burn my house, you can steal my car
Drink my liquor from an old fruit jar
Do anything that you wanna do
But uh uh, honey, lay off of my shoes
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything, but lay off of my blue suede shoes

Well, it's one for the money, two for the show
Three to get ready, now go, cat, go
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything, but lay off of my blue suede shoes

Well, it's blue, blue, blue suede shoes
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes, yeah
Well, blue, blue, blue suede shoes
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything, but lay off of my blue suede shoes
