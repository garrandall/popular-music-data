From the 1973 Live Album, Land of Make Believe
Chuck Mangione Quartet with the Hamilton Philharmonic Orchestra
& Esther Satterfield, vocalist

When you're feeling down and out
Wondering what this world's about
I know a place that has the answer

It's a place where no one dies
It's a land where no one cries
And good vibrations always
Greet you

How I love when my thoughts run
To the land of make believe
Where everything is fun
Forever

Children always gather around
Mother Goose and all her rhyme
They fill the air with sounds
Of laughter

People dancing
Their hearts are filled
With all the reasons why
You and I should learn the way
Of the land of make believe
And make this world of ours
Much brighter


I once asked the Wizard of Oz
For the secret of his land
He said, "Just take a look around here
Seven dwarves and Little Boy Blue
Uncle Remus and Snow White, too
(Now, just between us
That's what's known as integration.)

Jack and Jill are hard at work
Helping children dream awhile
And Snoopys making smiles
For grown-ups

All the elves are making toys
They are rich with all the joys
Of seeing happy kids
At Christmas

We are waiting
To help you find
The dream made just for you

In a few words let's just say
That in answer to your quiz
Imagination is
The secret. "




Hear the music of the band
It was written in our land
For what's a song but someone's
Dream?

In your world there was a King
He once said, "I have a dream,"
Now there's a man who new
The secret

Dreams are really
The thoughts that you
Have hidden in your heart

When you start a brand new day
Let your heart show you the way
And make a dream or two
Come true

How I love when my thoughts run
To the land of make believe
Where everything is fun
Forever
