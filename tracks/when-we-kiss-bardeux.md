It was late one night
And we had a fight
And it seemed like nothing
Was going right
Then you turned around
And you walked
Right out the door
Now it`s not the first time
It`s not the last
I know all about
Your checkered past
And we played this game
One thousand times before
Do you remember the night
I can see it so clear
All the sweet little things
That you sang in my ear
There were promises made
But I think you forgot
What you said
There`s a real fine line
Between love and hate
And I`m not the type
To just sit and wait
I`ve made up my mind
I can`t wait for you anymore
But when we kiss
It feels like this
And when we touch
It means so much
So many days go by
And I still want you so
If it was up to me
I`d never let you go
You`re the only true love in my life
And I want you to know
All this passion and pain
I think I`m going insane
We`ve got nothing to lose
And so much to gain
If you love me today
Who`s to say you`d not leave me again
Do you remember the night
I can see it so clear
All the sweet little things
That you sang in my ear
There were promises made
But I think you forgot
What you said
There`s a real fine line
Between love and hate
And I`m not the type
To just sit and wait
I`ve made up my mind
I can`t wait for you anymore
But when we kiss
It feels like this
And when we touch
It means so much

Your checkered past
And we played this game

But when we kiss
It feels like this
And when we touch
It means so much
But when we kiss
It feels like this
And when we touch
It means so much......
