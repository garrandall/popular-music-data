I hear some people been talking me down
Bring up my name, pass it around
They don't mention the happy times
They do their thing, I do mine

Oh baby that's hard to change
I can't tell them how to feel
Some get stoned, some get strange
But sooner or later it all gets real


Walk on, walk on


I remember the good old days
Stayed up all night getting crazed
Then the money was not so good
But we still did the best we could

Oh baby that's hard to change
I can't tell them how to feel
Some get stoned, some get strange
But sooner or later it all gets real
