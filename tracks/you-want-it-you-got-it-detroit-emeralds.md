I've lots of a money
Got two diamond rings
Got good conenctions
I can get you anything, girl

Don't make no difference what it is
It's all for you
I'm ready to give

You want it, you got it
You want it, you got it
Oh, baby
You want it, you got it
Just ask me, baby
You want it, you got it

Just tell me what you want
Say it loud, something clear
I'm willing to bet on my soul
What you want
I got it here

No matter the you're in
Want you to come and be my girlfriend
No need for you to be without it
If I ain't got it
I'll find it

Got plenty of money
Even got some to spare
I'll give you a big supply
So can show up anywhere

Got two fine cars
And you can keep one for yourself
If there's anything else you want
Just take it

Don't make no difference what it is
It's all for you
I'm ready to give

You want it, you got it
Lord, baby
You want it, you got it
Just ask me
You want it, you got it
Hey, baby
You want it, you got it

Woo, wait a minute
Now listen here, baby
I got something else for you
I don't know

Whatever you want, baby
I'm gonna bring it to your door
Got lots of money
Got my two diamond rings
