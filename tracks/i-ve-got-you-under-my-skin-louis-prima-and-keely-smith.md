I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin

I've tried so not to give in
I've said to myself this affair never will go so well
But why should I try to resist, when, baby, will I know?
Than well that I've got you under my skin

I'd sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear

Don't you know, you fool, you never can win
Use your mentality, wake up to reality but each time I do
Just the thought of you makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin, I've got you under my skin
