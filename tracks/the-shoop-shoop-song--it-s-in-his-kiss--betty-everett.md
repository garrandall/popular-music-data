Does he love me? I wanna know
How can I tell if he loves me so?
(Is it in his eyes?)
Oh no, you'll be deceived
(Is it in his eyes?)
Oh no, he'll make believe
If you wanna know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss
(That's where it is, oh yeah)
(Or is it in his face?)
Oh no, it's just his charm
(In his one embrace)
Oh no, that's just his arm
If you wanna know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss
(That's where it is)
Oh oh, it's in his kiss
(That's where it is)
Oh oh oh, kiss him and squeeze him tight
And find out what you wanna know
If it's love, if it really is
It's there in his kiss
(How 'bout the way he acts)
Oh no, that's not the way
And you're not listenin' to all I say
If you wanna know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss
(That's where it is)
Oh yeah, it's in his kiss
(That's where it is)
Whoa oh oh, kiss him and squeeze him tight
And find out what you wanna know
If it's love, if it really is
It's there in his kiss
(How 'bout the way he acts)
Oh no, that's not the way
And you're not listenin' to all I say
If you wanna know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss
(That's where it is)
Oh yeah, it's in his kiss
(That's where it is)
Oh oh, it's in his kiss
(That's where it is)
