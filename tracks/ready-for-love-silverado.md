Ain't ready for the leaves to change
Don't wanna get off this swing
No I ain't jealous
When the sun's kissing on you

Baby, it's that southern wind
Baby, it's your perfect skin
That's killing me
Through the holes
In your silver boots

Baby, what's up
This is more than a crush
Already dressed like that
Heat rises it's a fact

Baby, three months
Just ain't long enough
We can turn the clock back
Flip over the hour glass

Summer forever
Ain't nothin' better than
Love makin' weather
Summer forever
Hotter than winter
On that Silverado leather
The days are getting longer
Kisses getting stronger
It's the kinda song
That makes you wanna sing along
Summer forever
Oh, oh

I'm talking fireworks
I'm talking on fire
Barefoot walking
Chasing whiskey
With a fat tire

Don't matter where we go
Let's ride an open road
And a sunroof open
Making up as we rolling like

Summer forever
Ain't nothin' better than
Love makin' weather
Summer forever
Hotter than winter
On that Silverado leather
The days are getting longer
Kisses getting stronger
It's the kinda song
That makes you wanna sing along
Summer forever
Yeah, yeah, woo

It don't matter where we go
Let's ride an open road
And a sunroof open
Making up and say we rolling like

It don't matter where we go
Let's ride an open road
And a sunroof open
Making up and say we rolling like

Summer forever
Ain't nothin' better than
Love makin' weather
Summer forever
Hotter than winter
On that Silverado leather
The days are getting longer
Kisses getting stronger
It's the kinda song
That makes you wanna sing along
Summer forever
Woah, woah

That's right
You and me
The sunshine
The water
It's summertime
Forever
