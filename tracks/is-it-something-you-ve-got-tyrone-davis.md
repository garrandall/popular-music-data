Oh when I first said I was leaving
Girl, I didn't think I would have to stay gone so long
Ah but now five weeks have ended
And I just realized that I did you worng

But just think why'all I thought I was a big thing
But apparently she thought not
There must be something that I'm missing
Or is it something that she's got

Oh baby what is that you got now baby
Oh I thought I had your mind right
Cause this is what you led me to believe
Oh but now I'm the one who's uptight

And baby I'm the one who's got to plead
But just think why'all, I thought I was a big thing
But apparently she thought not
There must be something that I'm missing

Or is it something that she's got
Oh baby what is that you got now baby
All your sweet lovin' baby
Is oh so devastating to a man

Ah but just like black magic baby
I'm no fool but I couldn't understand
But just think why'all I thought I was a big thing
But apparently she thought not

There must be something that I'm missing
Or is it something that she's got
Oh baby what is that you got now
It makes me want to cry

Baby I love you
Oh baby, oh baby, baby, baby
