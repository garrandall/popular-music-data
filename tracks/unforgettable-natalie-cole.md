Unforgettable, that's what you are
Unforgettable, though near or far
Like a song of love that clings to me
How the thought of you does things to me
Never before has someone been more
Unforgettable in every way
And forevermore (and forevermore)
That's how you'll stay (that's how you'll stay)
That's why darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too



No, never before has someone been more
Ohunforgettable (unforgettable)
In every way (in every way)
And forevermore (and forevermore)
That's how you'll stay (that's how you'll stay)
That's why darling it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too.
