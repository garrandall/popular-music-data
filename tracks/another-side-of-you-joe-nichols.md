Well you rolled out of bed and stubbed your toe
And I heard you almost cuss
And I fought back the urge to laugh
Just listen to you fuss
Then you overdid the coffee
Couldn't get your hair just right
When I smiled and said good morning
You looked mad enough to fight

Well that's another side of you
That I'm in a love with too

Yeah that mini van is a far cry
From the sports car in your dreams
And that dead end job
Is pushin back vacation more it seems
You got soccer at 4:30
And ballet class by 5:00
Then I call you talkin' flirty
You ask have I lost my mind

Well that's another side of you
That I'm in love with too
When you lay down in my arms
Let go of all that stress
Whisper honey I love you
With your head on my chest
When the world's strongest woman is my lady
When the day is through
Well that's another side of you
That I'm in love with too

If I had to do the things you do
Well I'd just lose my mind
Somehow you get up by 8:00
And settle down by nine
And I hear you down the hallway
As you're layin' down to sleep
And pray the good lord watches over them for you and me

Well that's another side of you
That I'm in love with too
Well that's another side of you
That I'm in love with too
