You told me once you were mine, alone, forever
An' I was yours till the end of eternity
But all those vows are broken now and I will never
Be the same except in memory

Remember me when the candle lights are gleamin'
Remember me at the close of a long, long day
An' it would be so sweet when all alone, I'm dreamin'
Just to know you still remember me

A brighter face may take my place when we're apart, dear:
Another love, with a heart more bold and free
But in the end, fair weather friends may break your heart, dear
An' if they do, sweetheart, remember me

Remember me when the candle lights are gleamin'
Remember me at the close of a long, long day
An' it would be so sweet when all alone, I'm dreamin'
Just to know you still remember me

Just to know you still remember me
