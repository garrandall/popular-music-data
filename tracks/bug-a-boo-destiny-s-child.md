You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
Cause you a bug a boo, a bug a boo
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my emails stop
Cause you a bug a boo
You bugging what? you bugging who? You bugging me!
And don't you see it ain't cool


It's not hot that you be calling me, stressing me
Paging my beeper you're just non-stop
And it's not hot that you be leaving me messages
Every 10 minutes and then you stop by
When I first met you, you were cool
But it was game you had me fooled
Cause 20 minutes after I gave you my number
You already had my mailbox full


So what, you bought a pair of shoes
What now I guess you think I owe you?
You don't have to call as much as you do
I'd give 'em back to be through with you
And so what, my momma likes you
What now I guess you think I will too?
Even if the pope said he likes you too
I don't really care cause you're a bug a boo


You make me wanna throw my pager out the window (Hey)
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
Cause you a bug a boo, a bug a boo (A bug a boo)
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my emails stop
Cause you a bug a boo
You buggin' what? You buggin' who? You buggin' me!
And don't you see it ain't cool?


It's not hot, that when I'm blocking your phone number
You call me from over your best friends house
And its not hot, that I can't even go out with my girlfriends
Without you tracking me down
You need to chill out with that mess
Cause you can't keep havin' me stressed
Cause every time my phone rings it seems to be you
And I'm praying that it is someone else


So what, you bought a pair of shoes
What now I guess you think I owe you? (Owe you)
You don't have to call as much as you do
I'd give 'em back to be through with you
And so what, my momma likes you (So what!)
What now I guess you think I will too?
Even if the pope said he likes you too
I don't give a damn cause you're a bug a boo


You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
Cause you a bug a boo, a bug a boo (A bug a boo)
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my emails stop
Cause you a bug a boo
You bugging what? You bugging who? You bugging me!
And don't you see it ain't cool?


When you call me on the phone you're bugging me
When you follow me around you're bugging me
Everything you do be bugging me
You buggin' me, You buggin' me
When you show up at my door you're buggin' me
When you open up your mouth you're buggin' me
Every time I see your face you're buggin' me
You're buggin' me, buggin' me


You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles (Turn my phone off!)
Break my lease so I can move
Cause you a bug a boo, a bug a boo (A bug a boo)
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my emails stop
Cause you a bug a boo
You bugging what? You bugging who? You bugging me!
And don't you see it ain't cool?

You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
Cause you a bug a boo, a bug a boo
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my emails stop
Cause you a bug a boo
You bugging what? you bugging who? You bugging me!
And don't you see it ain't cool


Thou shall not get into temptation
