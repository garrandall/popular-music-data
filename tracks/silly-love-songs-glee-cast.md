You'd think that people would have had enough of silly love songs.
But I look around me and I see it isn't so.
Some people wanna fill the world with silly love songs.
And what's wrong with that?
I'd like to know, 'cause here I go again

I love you
I love you

I can't explain the feeling's plain to me, so can't you see?
Ah, she gave me more, she gave it all to me, now can't you see,

Love doesn't come in a minute,
Sometimes it doesn't come at all
I only know that when I'm in it
It isn't silly, no, it isn't silly, love isn't silly at all.

I love you
I can't explain the feeling's plain to me, so can't you see? (I love you)
Ah, she gave me more, she gave it all to me, now can't you see (I love you)
I can't explain the feeling's plain to me, so can't you see? (I love you)

You'd think that people would have had enough of silly love songs.
But I look around me and I see it isn't so, oh, no.
Some people wanna fill the world with silly love songs.
And what's wrong with that?
I'd like to know, 'cause here I go again

I love you
I love you

I can't explain the feeling's plain to me, so can't you see?
Ah, she gave me more, she gave it all to me, now can't you see?
I can't explain the feeling's plain to me.
