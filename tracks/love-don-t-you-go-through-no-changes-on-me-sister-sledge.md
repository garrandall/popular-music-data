I can't deny this feeling inside
That makes me love you
I'm under a spell but how can I tell
If it's really true love

(How) How can I be sure (Be sure)
Love don't walk out the door
Are you for real with the love that you feel
Or will it change with time, oh, no

Love don't you go through no changes on me
No, no, no
Love don't you go through no changes on me
No, no, no

Love don't you go through no changes on me
No, no, no
Love don't you go through no changes on me
No, no, no, no, no

No
No, no, no
Don't come with me, no
Don't come over here
Oh

You know I'm fair and that I care (I care)
Boy, I'm crazy about you
Wanna let myself go but I don't know (Don't know)
Just how you feel about me

(No) No, I can't afford (Afford)
To be hurt like before
Are you for real with the love that you feel
Or will it change with time, oh, no

Love don't you go through no changes on me
No, no, no
Love don't you go through no changes on me
No, no, no

Love (Love) don't you go through no changes on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Love (I feel your love) don't you go through no changes on me
Don't come with me, don't come with me
Boy, I got your lovin'

Love don't you go through no changes on me
No, I got the love
Love don't you go through no changes on me
Not on me, not on me, I don't want your lovin'

Love (No) don't you go through no changes on me
