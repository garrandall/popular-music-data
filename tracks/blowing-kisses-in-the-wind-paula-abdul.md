SO TELL BABY TELL YOUR TRUE HEART 
SAY WHAT YOU SAY WHEN YOU'RE ALL ALONE 
I'M TRYING 
TRYING TO TRY 
AND FEEL YOU 
AND SEE IF I SEE 
I'M FEELING ALONE 

AND ALL I WANT IS 
TO GET THROUGH 
SO BABY, YOU'D SEE THAT THE 
WAY YOU'RE LEAVING ME 
IT WON'T DO 
IT'S LIKE I'M... 

 
BLOWING KISSES IN THE WIND 
GIVIN' YOU LOVE THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN GIVEN 
I CROSS MY HEART AND HOPE TO DIE 
I'M ONLY WISHING YOU'D LOVE ME LIKE I 

BLOWING KISSES IN THE WIND 
WAITING, WAITING, WAITING 
WAITING FOR YOU IS 
ITS LIKE BLOWING, BLOWING KISSES 

SO PLEASE BABY, PLEASE 
RELEASE ME 
IF TIME OVER TIME YOUR HEART'S GROWING COLD 
I'M SAYING
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN BELIEVING 
THEN HOW COULD TRUE LOVE EVER BE SO 
AND ALL I WANT IS TO GET THROUGH 
SO BABY, YOU'D SEE THAT THE WAY YOU'RE LEAVING ME 
IT WON'T DO 

IT'S LIKE I'M 

 
LIKE I'M LIKE BLOWING KISSES 

I'M SOME-BIDDY-BUM-BUM 

LIKE I'M BLOWING KISSES 

AND ALL I WANT IS TO GET THROUGH 
SO BABY, YOU'D SEE THAT THE WAY YOU'RE LEAVING ME 

IT WON'T DO 

IT'S LIKE I'M... 



LIKE I'M BLOWING KISSES IN THE WIND 
LIKE I'M BLOWING KISSES IN THE WIND 
LIKE I'M BLOWING KISSES IN THE WIND 

WAITING FOR YOU IS 

IS LIKE BLOWING, BLOWING KISSES
