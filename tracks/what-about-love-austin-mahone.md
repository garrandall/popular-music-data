I, I'm feeling your thunder
The storm's getting closer, this rain is like fire
And my, my world's going under
And I can't remember the reason that you cut off the line


You're moving on, you say?
Here I stay, I'll take this pain, yeah, I can, I can


What about love? What about our promises?
What about love? You take it all and leave me nothing
What about love? What about us till we end?
What about love? You cut my wings, now I am falling
What about love?


Why, you are colder than winter?
You're switching the picture, you used to be perfect, yeah
Once, you're hot like the summer
Please help me remember the reason that you said “bye bye bye”


You're moving on, you say?
Here I stay, I'll take this pain, yeah, I can, I can


What about love? What about our promises?
What about love? You take it all and leave me nothing
What about love? What about us till we end?
What about love? You cut my wings, now I am falling
What about love?


Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh, what about, what about love?
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh, what about, what about love?
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh, what about, what about love?
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh, what about, what about love?


You're moving on, you say?
Here I stay watching every night get colder
You're moving on, you say?
Here I stay, I'll take this pain, yeah, I can, I can


What about love? What about our promises?
What about love? You take it all and leave me nothing
What about love? What about us till we end?
What about love? You cut my wings, now I am falling
What about love?


What about, what about love? What about…
What about love?
What about, what about love? What about…
What about love?
