 I- I'm a clone of Bieber wear oversized sneakers and sing into mirrors.
And my- my government grew me in a laboratory to become the next big teen hearthrob.

 Everything's looking good next we should test out how he performs the hook!

 Now I'm outside, my friends are dancing like tools.
See a black guy, and high five him so that I look cool.
Chasing a broad acting like I am in love.
Singing a song that sounds twenty years old and also my hat is dumb.

 Who is this scum?

 Why are you walking away? I guess you must be gay, 'cause I'm fucking perfect, bitch.

 No, it's because you look 9, and I hope you realize that this song sounds just like Bye Bye Bye.

 Everyting's looking great, with Austin.

 Wait, who is that?

 Oh shit it's Justin.

 This needs to stop.

 Crap he found us this is bad.

 You think you're hot, but you don't even wear drop crotch pants

 Justin piss off, I'm the new you kiss my ass

 That's the last straw, I challenge you to a swag match

 OK it's on! Swag swag swag swag swag.

 Like Donkey Kong! Swag swag swag swag swag swag swag.

 What the hell is happening?

 Their egos are colliding, it is causing an earthquake we need to deactivate.
