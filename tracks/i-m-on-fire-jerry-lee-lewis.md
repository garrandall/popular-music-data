Well, help me, mister fireman, please
You know I'm burnin' from my head to my knees
I'm a-flame with such a burning desire
The little girl set my soul on fire
She's got me burning up like a paper cup…
…I say: "mmmh… I'm on fire!?"

Turn in full alarm
I'm a-flame from all of her charms
Oh, little firebug, can't you see
Can't you see what you're doin' to me?
She's got me burning up like a paper cup…
…I say: "mmmh… I'm on fire!?"

And when my babe kisses me
I start shakin' like a ship on a stormy sea
And when I hear her say
I'm gonna love you every minute of the day
I start to roast like toast… oh wee!
