Baby, there's no need to tell ya'
As far as I can clearly recall
My love has been here for you
So you don't have to worry at all
I'll sacrifice my time
I'll make sure you're satisfied
And it's no hard thing to the joy I bring
I wanna give you all my love


Loving you every day
Don't you look no more
Love without a limit
Loving you every day
Don't you look no more
Love without a limit


Baby, I'm in need of your love
And you got that touch
That I need so much
And I am about to explode
Freely, completely, everything you want I'll be
Good love down to the last drop
And I'm not gonna stop




Loving you is all I wanna do
Loving you is all I wanna do
Loving you, said loving you
Is all that I, all that I wanna do
Baby, baby, baby, heeeeey


I'm loving you everyday
Loving you everyday every hour baby
Don't look no more, don't look no more
Loving you everyday
Loving you babe everyday
