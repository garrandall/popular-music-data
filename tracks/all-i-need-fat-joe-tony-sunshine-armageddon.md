Cool & Dre
Who you gonna trust?
Yea, you could trust me, haha


La la la la la
Oooooh


I don't care about nothing else my baby (Baby I don't care)
All I care is bout being here for you (Oooh)
And I won't stare at nobody else my baby (Promise I won't stare)
Cuz all I need is you (All I need, all I need baby)


To all the ladies in our lives, you heard
Strong independent women, come on
Yea, huh


What you think gangstas don't cry get hurt by lies
Times you embarrassed me I swallowed my pride
I'm tired of telling you I got nothing to hide
I'm in the studio at night you think I'm out with the guys
Every time I speak to you you got something to say
According to you I must be crushing all day
All I'm askin you for is to be more trusting
I'm outta town all the time and don't accuse you of nothing
Picture me creepin with a chick on tour
When you love my son as if it was yours
I know at times you feel alone cuz I'm not at home
That's why every few hours I pick up the phone
To reassure you my love is more than it seems
I adore you my wife my Colombian Queen
I promise to never stray I'm honored everyday
To have a woman like you in the life of Jose (Hey)




Yea how I'm supposed to start this
First and first you my queen goddess
My moon my earth the wisdom to a nigga's knowledge
I swear to god it amazes me how you stay in college
And still manage to raise my baby boy when I'm gone and
Touring making dollars assuming that you know that I love you but regardless
I feel its time I showed you bless you with this ring, now that's
Something to hold you down till a nigga come back
Me and my lady got history this worth she deserves
More then this cold world is giving me to share with her word
And I don't care about nothing else except my girl (my girl)
Not myself no one else just my girl (my girl)
You bring life to my world you give me strength to go on
And face life even when it seems all hope's gone
Labeled my wife but you truly exceed the title
You my future my happiness my heart my idol
I promise girl, that




Haha
This is going out to you, you and you and you


To all the ladies out there if you love your man
You need to hold your man embrace your man
And just grab his hand repeat after me
I promise to stay true and give you all of me
Whether he's locked down or on the grind
Or whether is out of work or at work on time
You need to trust that man and respect that man
And you get what you feel you deserve from that man, and


Cuz I need somebody who will stand by me
Through the good times and bad times who will always...
always be my girl
