The Joker, he cried
He said, "Drifter, go home!"
Love's been denied
Won't you leave her alone?

I couldn't leave,
'Cause my love was too strong.
So I sat myself down
And sang her a love song.

The drifter, he sings
For an hour of time.
The dream doesn't fail,
It just needs more wine.

The Joker, he cried
He said, "Drifter, go home!"
Love's been denied
Won't you leave her alone?

The Joker, he cried
He said, "Drifter, go home!"
Love's been denied
Won't you leave her alone?

But I couldn't leave,
'Cause my love was too strong.
So I sat myself down
And sang her a love song.

And the lady, she cried
Said everything's wrong.
When the Joker gets weak,
Don't you know that the dream stays strong?

Wisdom's for fools
And a fool can't be told.
When the drifter gets cold
The Joker stays hot.
