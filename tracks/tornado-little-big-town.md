Thought you'd change the weather
Start a little storm
Make a little rain
But I'm gonna do one better hide the sun until you pray
I'm a tornado looking for a soul to take

You're gonna see me coming by the selfish things that you did
I'm gonna leave you guessin' how this funnel is gonna hit
I'm a tornado looking for a man to break

Yeah, I'm gonna lift this house, spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
Make sure you're never found

Thought you'd take a swing
Try another girl, try another night,
But it's the pain that brings my force of nature back to life
I'm a tornado more disturbed than an F5

Hey, I'm gonna lift this house, spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
I'm gonna lift this house, spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
Make sure you're never found, oh, yeah

OOOOOOOOOOO
MMMMMMMMMM

I'm gonna lift this house, spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
I'm gonna lift this house, spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
Make sure you're never found

The winds are getting stronger
And the sky is falling through
And you ain't got much longer
'Til the rage rips off the roof
I'm a tornado... and I'm coming after you...

Oooo...
Hm...
Oooo...

(I'm gonna lift this house, spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground)
