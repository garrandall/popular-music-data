I just went out to Morocco to do some recruiting
Fuck the government official, we're plugged with Putin
Got two twin sisters, yeah they squirt, they be shootin'
Don't get the squirt squirt on the shirt, shirt, be a fool
They drank the wine bar, pop a lot of bottles on the move
I turn the bando to a jewelry store, way I do
I turn the penthouse to a hotel, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
I turned out fifty four hoes, had 'em snortin' fish scale
Takin' a hit of it off her fingernail, oh well, well, well
Got some bad shit in Israel, oh well, well, well, well
Yeah, I can't be tellin' no lies, jewelers jump on a boat, boat
Went to Lagos, Nigeria traveled from coast to coast
Had to treat 'em like the Coast Guard, had to save a broad, oh yeah
We got the oil money comin' in, smokin' out the vape, oh yeah, yeah
She talkin' British, when they can't understand 'but they feel it, yeah, yeah
African gave my bitch eleven hunnid bands, I could dig it, yeah, yeah
Told her when she get back to the city, she comin' to spend it

Got two twin sisters, yeah they squirt, they be shootin'
Gonna get the squirt squirt on the shirt, shirt, be a fool
I turn the bando to a jewelry store, the way I do
I feed them racks to you like a monster, that's food
Somethin' like sponsor, I'm a player, yeah tell the truth
There's nothing I couldn't conquer, oh well, oh well, well
Got the hottest ones coming from from Brazil, oh well, oh yeah
She see the better side of me, she threw us a party
I got a six sons, I'm a Don like they last name Marley
Go lay in the sun, put your hair in a bun, ride it like a Harley
I got that one of one spill, so they record me

I just went out to Morocco to do some recruiting
Fuck the government official, we're plugged with Putin
Got two twin sisters, yeah they squirt, they be shootin'
Don't get the squirt squirt on the shirt, shirt, be a fool

When I drink codeine, I get in my feelings
I don't wanna see you in the same place as I'm in
I like taking ecstasy it made it made me a million
It made me get emotional with the bitches

I feed them racks to you like a monster, that's food
Told her when she get back to the city, she comin' to spend it
