Where do I go?
Follow the river
Where do I go?
Follow the girls
Where is the something
Where is the someone
That tells me why I live and die?


Where do I go?
Follow the children
Where do I go?
Follow their smiles
Is there an answer
In their sweet faces
That tells me why I live and die?


Follow the windstorm
Follow the thunder
Follow the neon in a young ladies eye
Down to the girl
Up to the glitter
Into the city
Thatâ€™s where the truth lies


Where do I go?
Follow my hearts beat
Where do I go?
Gonna follow my hands
Where will they lead me
And will I ever
Discover why I live and die?

Live and die
Why, I live and die
Are you and I


Where do I go?
I got to go
Where do I go?
Somebody tell me
Where do I go?
Where can I go?
Tell me, where can I go?
Where do I go?
Where do I go?
Where do I go?
Tell me where to go
You got to know
