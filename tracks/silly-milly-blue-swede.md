Sitting in a bus stop 
Singing silly songs 

I'm lying awake 
Your voice makes me shake 
Singing songs I can stand more 
The shower runs dry 
But I don't know why 
You're still singing like mad 

 
Silly Milly, you nearly kill me 
Now why don't you thrill me 
My love is still strong but maybe 
Silly Milly, if you're still trying 
To send my hair flying 
You're losing a friend 

How can I explain 
I'm trying in vain 
To get used to her simple songs 
But she does not care 
And I cannot bear 
That she's driving me mad 

 

Baby, tell me have you 
Gone out of your head 
Come on, Silly Milly, come on 
Milly, can't you see that 
You're making me feel bad 
Come on, silly, silly, silly 
Silly, Silly, silly 

 

Silly Milly, if you're still trying 
To send my hair flying 
You're losing a friend 

 

Silly Milly, you nearly kill me 
Now why don't you thrill me 
My love is still strong but maybe 

Silly Milly, you nearly kill me 
Now why don't you thrill me 
My love is still strong but maybe 

Silly Milly, you nearly kill me 
Now why don't you thrill me 
My love is still strong but maybe 

Silly Milly, you nearly kill me 
Now why don't you thrill me 
My love is still strong but maybe
