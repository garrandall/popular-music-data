Love has many colors,
Happy, good, bad, and blue.
But I've seen all of the others
And there ain't any sweeter than you.
You're my friend when I need somebody,
You're my smile whenever I'm down,
You're my joy, my sweet inspiration,
You're just love, when you're around. And
I'm gonna sing you a love song,
Not just the words and rhymes;
I'm gonna sing you a love song,
Just to tell you what's on my mind.
Baby, I'm gonna sing you a love song,
Especially for you;
Hope I can say in a simple way
Just-a how much I love you.

Listen to the lonely,
Together, but always alone.
They say love is only
Just a heartbeat, then it's gone,
You're my friend when I need somebody,
You're my smile whenever I'm down,
You're my joy, my sweet inspiration,
You're just love, when you're around. Hey,
I'm gonna sing you a love song,
Not just the words and rhymes;
I'm gonna sing you a love song,
Just to show you what's on my mind.
Baby, I'm gonna sing you a love song,
Especially for you;
And I hope I can say in a simple way
Just-a how much I love you.
