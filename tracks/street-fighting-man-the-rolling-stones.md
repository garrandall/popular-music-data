Everywhere I hear the sound of marching, charging feet, boy
Because summer's here and the time is right for fighting in the street boy
But what can a poor boy do except to sing for a Rock and Roll Band


Because in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for Street Fighting Man! No!


Hey! Think the time is right for a Palace Revolution
But where I live the game to play is Compromise Solution!
Well then what can a poor boy do except to sing for a Rock and Roll Band


Because in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for Street Fighting Man! No!


Hey! Said my name is called Disturbance
I'll shout and scream, I'll kill the King I'll rail at all his servants
Well then what can a poor boy do except to sing for a Rock and Roll Band


Because in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for Street Fighting Man! No!
