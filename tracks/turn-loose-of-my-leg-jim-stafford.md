These girls today they sure act funny
Take you out and spend their money
But they always seem to expect a favor or two
A girl picked me up about a week ago
Drug me out to some drive-in show
Oh,I can't begin to say what she put me through
She parked me on the very last row
Reached down and grabbed my knee
My whole life flashed before my eyes
I said this can't be happining to me

Chorus

Turn loose of my leg
I don't know you that well
Turn loose of my leg
In love with you I have not fell
I know what you are
Just forget it and remove your hand
Turn loose of my leg
I'm not that kind of man

The other day I was at the soda shop
Had an ice cream sundae and a soda pop
The waitress brought me a note from a woman in a booth
The note said join me for another round
And I'll pick up your check and show you the town
I can't begin to say what she put me through
Underneath that table her fingers did the walkin'
Till she touched the tip of my shoe
I ran for the door but she wouldn't let go
I must a drug her for a block or two

Turn loose of my leg
You don't seem to understand
I'm not that kind of man
You want to hug me and hold me
And kiss me on the mouth
You make me want to crawl the walls
When your hands start flying south

Chorus

(Spoken)
Animal
Now don't you think we can have some kind of relationship
Without being so physical...huh?
