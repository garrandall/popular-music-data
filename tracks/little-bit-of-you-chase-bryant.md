I hope that I ain't callin' too late baby
Hope you ain't closed those pretty blue eyes
Have you looked out of your window lately?
That moon's taken up half of that sky

Whoa, whoa!
I'm a little bit restless
Can't get you off of my mind
Oh!

I could use a little bit of your sweet kiss
Your lips on a night like this
I don't wanna be lonely with the stars all out
Need you here to help me or I might lose count
I could use a little bit of you right now
A little bit of you right now

Got my wheels pulling off that highway
My headlights pointing down your street
I got your song cranked up on the radio
But you ain't singing sitting next to me, yeah

Whoa, whoa!
Girl I need you now
Walk on out!

I could use a little bit of your sweet kiss
Your lips on a night like this
I don't wanna be lonely with the stars all out
Need you here to help me or I might lose count
I could use a little bit of you right now
Yeah

Oh, I could use a little bit of your heartbeat on mine
Your head on my chest all night long

I could use a little bit of your sweet kiss
Your lips on a night like this
I don't wanna be lonely with the stars all out
Need you here to help me or I might lose count
I could use a little bit of your love, your smile
That thing you do that drives me wild
Your kiss, your touch
I could use a little, I could use a little bit of you right now
I wanna put my arms around a little bit of you right now
