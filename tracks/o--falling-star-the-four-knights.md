Oh falling star (falling star)
May I wish on you
And if I do
Can my wish come true

Oh falling star (falling star)
My heart is lonely
It longs for love
Will it come to me

I see romance (romance)
All around me, but I'm alone
Lovers walk hand in hand pass me
None for my own

Oh falling star (falling star)
Hear me and be kind
Please send someone
To this heart of mine

O-o-o-o-o falling star (falling star)
Hear me and be kind
Please please please send someone
To this heart of mine
Oh falling star
