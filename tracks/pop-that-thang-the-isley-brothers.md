Pop that thang
Bang, bang, bang
Pop that thang
Bang, bang, bang
Ting a ling a ling
I hook it on up
Get on down
Now do your stuff
Come on
Pop that thang
Bang, bang, bang
Pop that thang
Bang, bang, bang
If you can't do it right
Don't you try it again
Look at that rooster
Runnin' after that hen
Come on
Pop that thang
Bang, bang, bang
Pop that thang
Bang, bang, bang
Sister Rosaline
Ting a ling a ling
Look at that child
Popping that thang
Hitch up to my wagon
And get ready to roll
But don't get on board
If you can't carry the load
If balloon goes down
I fill it up with wind
If the record stops
Start it over again
Pop that thang
Bang, bang, bang
Pop that thang
Bang, bang, bang
Ting a ling a ling
Hook it on up
Get on down
And do your own stuff
Pop that thang
Bang, bang, bang
Pop that thang
Bang, bang, bang
If you can't do it right
Don't you try it again
Look at that rooster
Running after that hen
Come on and pop it
Pop it, pop it, pop it
Come on and pop it
Pop it, pop it, pop it
Come on and pop it
