Sorry, jealousy, sorry, baby so sorry,
I was so full of jealousy, so full of jealousy,

Sorry, jealousy, sorry, baby so sorry, 
I was no good at jealousy, no good at jealousy.

He's here, oh honey for just a day,
I'll find away to get away,
No matter what you say, hey hey.

He's here, oh honey for just a day,
He's coming from so far away,
For just a day, hey hey.
I don't want to deceive you,
But tell me how can I be true,
When all the jealousy,
Keeps me from telling it all to you.

Sorry, jealousy, sorry, baby so sorry, 
I was so full of jealousy, so full of jealousy,

He's here, oh honey for just once a year,
That ain't so much for you to share,
That ain't so much to share.

He's here, oh honey for just once a year,
You got my lovin' right here,
Prepare now there, now there.

Nothing is never the same when your sorry,
I'm really sorry of my jealousy,
Keeps you from knowing another side of me,
He loves me too and hes not jealous of you.

Sorry, jealousy, sorry, baby so sorry, 
I was so full of jealousy, so full of jealousy.

Baby, sorry, jealousy, sorry, jealousy, 
So full of jealousy...
