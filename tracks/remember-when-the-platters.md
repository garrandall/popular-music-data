Remember when (dah-doot-doo-doo) I first met you (dah-doot-doo-doo)
My lips were so afraid to say "I love you"
Remember when (dah-doot-doo-doo), to my surprise (dah-doot-doo-doo)
The heaven in my heart leaped into your eyes

Remember how much I cried
It was dumb to think you were mine
Darling, down deep inside
I still feel that feeling divine

I loved you then (dah-doot-doo-doo) and I still do (dah-doot-doo-doo)
I can't remember when I didn't love you

Remember how much I cried
It was dumb to think you were mine
Darling, down deep inside
I still feel that feeling divine

I loved you then and I still do
I can't remember when I didn't love you
