You don't love me
Like I love you
Nobody could
Oh, nobody could

But when your close your
Your arms around me
It do me so good
It do me so good

You keep me reeling
I'm not rocking
Oh, my heart is aching
Please don't, don't
Drive me mad

Oh, honey, just keep on
Reeling and rocking
Myheart is open
Oh, oh, I, I

Oh, honey, hug me
If you love me
The way you should
Oh, the way you should

When your close your
Your arms around me
It do me so good
It do me so good

Oh, when your close your
Your loving arms around me
It do me so good
It do me so good

Love that boy
