Let's go again
Where we went last night
Let's go again, baby
Let's go do it up right
I know you got things to do
But everybody's expecting you
So let's go again
Where we went last night
(Where we went last night)
Let's rock again
Baby, don't be shy
Oh, let's rock, let's rock
Let's just set the house on fire
You don't have a thing to lose
So put on your dancing shoes
And let's go again
Where we went last night
(Where we went last night)
Baby, baby, don't forget
We're gonna dance
Til we're soaking wet
The band's gonna swing
And the band's gonna rock
And we're gonna jump
All round the clock
Come on, come on
Come and go with me
Well, come on, come on, baby
You know I need your company
Oh, baby, don't
You feel so glad
When you think
About the fun we had
So let's go again
Where we went last night
(Where we went last night)
Eyeah, come on, come on
(Where we went last night)
Baby, baby
Baby, don't forget
We're gonna dance
Til we're soaking wet
The band's gonna swing
And the band's gonna rock
And we're gonna jump
All around the clock
Come on, come on
Come and go with me
Yeah, come on, come on
You know I need your company
Oh, baby, don't
You feel so glad
When you think
About the fun we had
So let's go again
Where we went last night
(Where we went last night)
Come on, come on
(Where we went last night)
Come and go with me
(Where we went last night)
Come on, come on, baby
(Where we went last night)
You know I need your company
(Where we went last night)
Let me hear you say yeah
(Where we went last night)
Can I come along with you
(Where we went last night)
Come on, baby, come on, baby
