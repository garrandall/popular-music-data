Oh, there?s one thing that I?m sure
It?s so proud and it?s so pure

And it comes from deep within
It?s got no hair it?s got no skin

As we travel far and near
We bring the world for you to hear

And the message that we bring
Is the light in the words we sing

And no matter how bad you feel
We got something, they can?t steal

No they can?t, no they can?t, no they can?t
Take away our music, no

No they can?t, no they can?t, no they can?t
Take away our music

In the ghetto, it gets cold
But we got something to warm our souls

Like the blanket of our faith
Keeps us covered when we shake

Though they take my brother?s life
And deny his given rights

Yes, the message will be heard
As the four winds spread the word

And our spirit, they can?t break
?Cause we got power to communicate, yea

No they can?t, no they can?t, no they can?t
Take away our music, Lord

No they can?t, no they can?t
I say, they can?t take our music, music, little baby (unintelligible)
But his message is my book, my book, is your book, is everybody?s book. Come on
Music is fine, music is alright, alright with me, yea
Come on, come on, sing it mom, sing it pop, sing it brother, sing it sister

Everybody, come on. Get up on your feet, now, and stomp your feet, clap your hands, come on. Oh
Sing it to your man, sing it to your woman, sing it to your baby, sing it to the sky
Sing to ev?, sing it to the ground, sing it to the earth, my, my, my, my, come on
They can?t take it away, they can?t take it away. Oooo. Come on, come on, come on
