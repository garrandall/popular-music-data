Baby, does he do it for ya?
When he's finished, does he step back and adore ya?
I just gotta know
'Cause your time is money and I won't let him waste it
Oh no no

Baby, just go with it
'Cause when you're with me I can't explain it
It's just different
We can take it slow
Or act like you're my girl,
Let's skip the basics

He's so replaceable
You're worth the chase you're putting on

It's alright
I'm not dangerous
When you're mine
I'll be generous
You're irreplaceable
Collectible
Just like fine China

Favorite. You're my favorite
It's like all the girls around me don't have faces.
And the saying goes,
"Life is just a game," but I'm not playin'

He's so replaceable
You're worth the chase, you're puttin' up.

It's alright
I'm not dangerous, girl
When you're mine
I'll be generous
You are
You're irreplaceable
Collectible (just like)
Just like fine China

It's alright, girl
I'm not dangerous
I'm not dangerous
When you're mine
I'll be generous
You are
You're irreplaceable
You are
Collectible
You are
Just like fine China

Took me awhile to find your love
Ain't no amount of time in this world
Save me a lot of time and just love me
Feel it, baby, feel it in your soul
Are you ready?
I know your heart's been telling you you belong to me

It's alright
I'm not dangerous
When you're mine
I'll be generous
You're irreplaceable
Collectible
Just like fine China
