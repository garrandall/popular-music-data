When you walk through a storm
Hold your head up high
And don't be afraid
Of the dark

At the end of a storm
Is a golden sky
And the sweet silver
Song of a lark

Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be
Tossed and blown

Walk on, walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never, ever walk alone

Walk on, walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never, ever walk alone
