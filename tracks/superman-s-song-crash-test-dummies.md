Tarzan
Wasn't a ladies' man
He'd just come along and scoop 'em up under his arm like that
Quick as a cat
In the jungle

But Clark Kent
Now there was a real gent
He would not be caught sittin' around in no junglescape,
Dumb as an ape
Doing nothing

Superman never made any money
For saving the world from Solomon Grundy
And sometimes I despair the world will never see another man like him

Hey Bob,
Supe had a straight job
Even though he could have smashed through any bank in the United States,
Well he had the strength,
But he would not

Folks said
His family were all dead
Planet crumbled but Superman, he forced himself to carry on,
Forget Krypton,
And keep going

Superman never made any money
For saving the world from Solomon Grundy
And sometimes I despair the world will never see another man like him

Tarzan was king of the jungle and Lord over all the apes
But he could hardly string together four words "I Tarzan, You Jane"

Sometimes when
Supe was stopping crimes
I'll bet that he was tempted to just quit and turn his back on man
Join Tarzan
In the forest

But he
Stayed in the city,
And kept on changing clothes in dirty old phone booths 'til his work was through
And nothing to do
But go on home

Superman never made any money
For saving the world from Solomon Grundy
And sometimes I despair the world will never see another man like him

And sometimes I despair the world will never see another man like him
