How did this happen
That the only one who can touch me again
Can break my heart into pieces
Maybe holdin' you tight in the night
Just takes my breath away

And just for that moment when you're close to me
Our love runs free
And just for that moment when I'm holding you
I know you love me too
I love you, you know I do
Can you tell me
That you'll never gonna leave me
Cause I love you, you know I do
Can you tell me
That my love won't fade away
My love won't fade away

Now I remember all the loneliness
Your tenderness has swept away
From inside me like a flowin' stream
It always seems will never stop

And just for that moment when you're close to me
Our love runs free
And just for that moment when I'm holding you
I know you love me too
I love you, you know I do
Can you tell me
And you'll never gonna leave me
Cause I love you, you know I do
Can you tell me
That my love won't fade away
My love won't fade away
My love, my love, my love, my love
My love won't fade away
