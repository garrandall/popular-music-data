All my life I’ve been alone but I’ve never really cared
Just a face inside a crowd a stranger everywhere
Everyone I’ve ever known has disappointed me
I live and breathe only for me

No one’s ever been inside the wall surrounding me
I depend on me myself to keep me company
No one cares about me so I take good care of me
I’m in a world all of my own

Oh a one man band plays all alone, he plays to a song of his own
(Yes he does, yes he does, yes he does)
Oh a one man band plays all alone, he plays to a song of his own

And I’m so self-contented that it sometimes frightens me
I can do most anything with no one helping me
I’m concerned in everything that’s for the good of me
No one but me cares about me

And each man is the master of his own destiny
And I can surely best determine what is right for me
If I had the chance to chance to change my life I wouldn’t dare
Doing okay living this way

Oh a one man band plays all alone, he plays to a song of his own
(Yes he does, yes he does, yes he does)
Oh a one man band plays all alone, he plays to a song of his own

(bridge)
Oh a one man band plays all alone, he plays to a song of his own
(Yes he does, yes he does, yes he does)
Oh a one man band plays all alone, he plays to a song of his own
(Yes he does, yes he does, yes he does)
Oh a one man band plays all alone, he plays to a song of his own
(Yes he does, yes he does, yes he does)
Oh a one man band plays all alone, he plays to a song of his own
(fade...)
