Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
La, la, la, la, la, laa
La, la, la, la, la, la


Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?


I've seen you 'round for a long long time
I remembered you when you drank my wine


Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?


I've seen you walking down in Chinatown
I called you, but you could not look around


Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?


I paid my money to the welfare line
I see you standing in it every time


Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?


The color of your skin don't matter to me
As long as we can live in harmony


Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?


I'd kind of like to be the President
So I can show you how your money's spent


Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?


Sometimes, I don't speak right
But yet, I know what I'm talking about


Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?


I know you're working for the CIA
They wouldn't have you in the Mafi-A


Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?


Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?


Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?


Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
