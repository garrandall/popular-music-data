I'm sittin' in my room, I'm starin' out my window
And I wonder where you've gone
Thinking back on the happy hours just before the dawn
Outside the wind is blowin'
It seems to call your name again
Where have you gone

City streets and lonely highways
I travel down
My car is empty and the radio just seems to bring me down
I'm just tryin' to find me
A pretty smile that I can get into
It's true, I'm lost without you

Another lonely park, another Sunday
Why is it life turns out that way
Just when you think you got a good thing
It seems to slip away

It's warm outside, no clouds are in the sky
But I need myself a place to go and hide
I keep it to myself
I don't want nobody else
To see me cryin' all those tears in my eyes

Another park, another Sunday
Why is it life turns out that way
Just when you think you got a good thing
It seems to slip away

Another park, another Sunday
It's dark and empty thanks to you
I got to get myself together
But it's hard to do
