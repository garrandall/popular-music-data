Baby, baby, here, look at me
Yes, I know, I know, I know
Maybe, maybe, it's not worth a damn
All the things we do to ourselves
We don't understand

But who can say what tomorrow will be?
We'll see

All our tomorrows find their own way
And hear the sound of a distant thunder
Fading away
For every lonely night, yeah
We'll make our own brand new delight, yes
And take all the comfort we may

Baby, baby, just look at me
Yes, it shows, how it shows
But nothin' worked out like I thought it would
I could've done worst, you know
So I must have done good

And who can say what tomorrow will be?
We'll see

All our tomorrows find their own way (don't you worry, baby, no)
And hear the sound of a distant thunder
Fading away
For every lonely night, yeah
We'll make our own brand new delight
And take all the comfort we may

I found love
In the strangest place
And refuge from the cold of the night
In a stranger's face
Your face, baby
