This is the point when I need everybody get to the dance floor
It's like that, y'all (That, y'all), that, y'all (That, y'all)
Da, da, da, da, I like that, y'all (That, y'all)
It's like that, y'all (That, y'all), that, y'all (That, y'all)
Like that, that, that, that, I like that, y'all (That, y'all), MC


I came to have a party
Open off that Bacardi
Feeling so hot tamale
Boy, I know you watchin' me, so what's it gonna to be?
Purple taking me higher
I'm lifted and I like it
Boy, you got me inspired
Baby, come and get it if you're really feelin’ me


'Cause it's my night
No stress, no fights
I'm leavin’ it all behind
No tears, no time to cry
Just making the most of life


Everybody is livin’ it up
All the fellas keep lookin’ at us
Me and my girls on the floor like what
While the DJ keeps on spinning the cut
It's like that, y'all (That, y'all), that, y'all (That, y'all)
It's like that, that, that, that, I like that, y'all (That, y'all)
It's like that, y'all (That, y'all), that, y'all (That, y'all)
It's like that, that, that, that, I like that, y'all (That, y'all)


You like this and you know it
Caution, it's so explosive
Them chickens is ash and I'm lotion
Baby, come and get it, let me give you what you need
It's a special occasion
Mimi's emancipation
A cause for celebration
I ain’t gonna let nobody's drama bother me


‘Cause it's my night (My night)
No stress, no fights
I'm leaving it all behind
No tears (No tears), no time to cry
Just making the most of life


Everybody is livin’ it up
All the fellas keep lookin’ at us
Me and my girls on the floor like what
While the DJ keeps on spinning the cut
It's like that, y'all (That, y'all), that, y'all (That, y'all)
It's like that, that, that, that, I like that, y'all (That, y'all)
It's like that, y'all (That, y'all), that, y'all (That, y'all)
It's like that, that, that, that, I like that, y'all (That, y'all)


'Cause it's my night (It's my, it's my, it's my night)
No stress, no fights
I'm leavin’ it all behind
No tears (No tears), no time to cry
(Baby, I’m) Just making the most of life


Everybody is livin' it up
All the fellas keep lookin’ at us
Me and my girls on the floor like what
While the DJ keeps on spinning the cut
It's like that, y'all (That, y'all), that, y'all (That, y'all)
It's like that, that, that, that, I like that, y'all (That, y'all)
It's like that, y'all (That, y'all), that, y'all (That, y'all)
It's like that, that, that, that, I like that, y'all (That, y'all)
This is my night


Let's go now (What), let's go now (What)
Here we go now (What), here we go now (What)
Let's go now (What), let's go now (What)
Here we go now (What), here we go now (What)
Let's go now (What), let's go now (What)
Here we go now (What), here we go now (What)
Let's go now (What), let's go now (What)
Here we go now (What), here we go now (What)
