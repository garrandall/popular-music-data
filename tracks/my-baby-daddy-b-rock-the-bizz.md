Who that is? (That's just my baby daddy)
Who that is? (That's just my baby dad)
Who that is? (That's just my baby daddy)
Who that is? (Boy, that's just my baby dad)
Who that is? (That's just my baby dad)
Who that is? (That's just my baby dad)
Who that is? (That's just my baby daddy)
Who that is? (T-Bird, that's just my baby daddy)


Why every time I call it's the same thing?
You have to be on the phone with Elaine
Or either Shawna, or Dawna
(T-Bird, lemme call you back, the phoneâ€™s for my mama)
When the phone click don't even try girl
Quit lying girl
You must think I'm stupid or either blind girl
Cuz something ain't right
And I'm fixing to go
You said y'all broke up a long time ago
And who was L.A. Sno?
(But it ain't nobody, that's just my baby daddy)


Who that is? (That's just my baby daddy)
Who that is? (That's just my baby dad)
Who that is? (That's just my baby daddy)
Who that is? (Boy, that's just my baby dad)
Who that is? (That's just my baby dad)
Who that is? (That's just my baby dad)
Who that is? (That's just my baby daddy)
Who that is? (T-Bird, that's just my baby daddy)


You said your baby daddy was locked up, but why?
The Bird say y'all was at the mall
(You a liar) You a liar
OK then, what his name? (Lavall)
Yesterday you said his name was Jay, so it ain't the same
It must be your new boyfriend
How come your best friend told me the dude's name was Ken? (Whatever)
You better get it together, cuz whenever you lie?
I'm like Mary J., I'm not gon' cry (Don't cry)
Hey, why don't you get up and get the door? (You get the door)
Yo, who that is? (I don't know, who is it?)
I bet that's just your baby daddy


Who that is? (That's just my baby daddy)
Who that is? (That's just my baby dad)
Who that is? (That's just my baby daddy)
Who that is? (Boy, that's just my baby dad)
Who that is? (That's just my baby dad)
Who that is? (That's just my baby dad)
Who that is? (That's just my baby daddy)
Who that is? (T-Bird, that's just my baby daddy)

What's up man? You be ready to go?
(What we do now?)
You know we gotta go to the store
Now see, that's a perfect example
You know you ain't fittin' to go and get no pampers
Well, while ya at it, get some milk
If you don't hurry back, I'mma been done dipped
Oh baby, you can save the drama
Cuz I'm feeling going to see my baby mama


Who that is? (That's just my baby daddy)
Who that is? (That's just my baby dad)
Who that is? (That's just my baby daddy)
Who that is? (Boy, that's just my baby dad)
Who that is? (That's just my baby dad)
Who that is? (That's just my baby dad)
Who that is? (That's just my baby daddy)
Who that is? (T-Bird, that's just my baby daddy)

I'm sick and tired, girl
You 'bout to get fired, girl
Don't even try, girl
But I ain't all really polite, girl
I'm sick and tired, girl
You 'bout to get fired, girl
Shut up and keep quiet, girl
I'm sick and tired of all your lying, girl

(T-Bird, I need some money for my baby)
I ain't giving you no money, that ain't my baby
(Yes T-Bird, it was)
That ain't my kid
(Yes it is your daughter)
I got one son
(You got a daughter, too)
I got a son named Chris and that's it
(T-bird, you trippin')
I ain't smell that junk you talk
(T-Bird!)
Forget that!
(But T-Bird, I love you)
I ain't wit it, I ain't wit it


Who that is? (That's just my baby daddy)
Who that is? (That's just my baby dad)
Who that is? (That's just my baby daddy)
Who that is? (That's just my baby dad)
Who that is? (That's just my baby dad)
Who that is? (That's just my baby dad)

My man Agee say Hell! Ain't your baby daddy
L.A. Sno! Ain't your baby daddy
My man it's Pressure, ain't your baby daddy
Uh J.D., he ain't yo baby daddy

That's just my baby daddy


Who that is? (That's just my baby daddy)
Who that is? (That's just my baby dad)
Who that is? (That's just my baby daddy)
Who that is? (Boy, that's just my baby dad)
Who that is? (That's just my baby dad)
