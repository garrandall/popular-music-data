I promise to wait, my love, right here 'til you return
With a love that's weak and a heart that sadly yearns
Yearns because you've left me all alone and blue
And to another I know I can't be true
I know that you'll come back home
But hurry up, don't take so long
'Cause I love you, need you
Even though you've done me wrong


I promise to wait, my love, until you finally find
The love you're sharin' now is not as real as mine
Her love is like a diamond only worth a dime
But my love for you is strictly genuine
I know that you'll come back home
But hurry up, don't take so long
'Cause I love you, need you
Even though you've done me wrong


How I miss you; I long to hear you call my name
And since you've been gone, baby
You don't think this ain't been the same, no


I promise to wait, my love, right here till you return
With arms that want you, baby, & flames that forever burn
I cry for your tender love & ever-lovin' kiss
And your tight embrace is what I really miss
I know that you'll come back home
But hurry up, don't take so long
'Cause I love you, need you
Even though you've done me wrong
Gonna stay right here, my love; ain't goin' away
Gonna wait for you, baby
