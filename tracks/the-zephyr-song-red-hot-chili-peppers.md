Can I get your hand to write on?
Just a piece of leg to bite on
What a night to fly my kite on
Do you want to flash a light on?
Take a look it's on display for you
Coming down, no, not today
Did you meet your fortune teller?
Get it off with no propeller
Do it up, it's on with Stella
What a way to finally smell her
Picking up, but not too strong for you
Take a piece and pass it on


Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together
Fly on my wind


Rebel and a liberator
Find a way to be a skater
Rev it up to levitate her
Super friendly aviator
Take a look it's on display, for you
Coming down, no not today


Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together


In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my Zephyr
We'll find a place together




Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-woah, do you
Yea-yea-yea-yea-yea-yeah
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-woah, want to
Yea-yea-yea-yea-yea-yeah


Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together


In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my Zephyr
We're going to live forever


Forever
