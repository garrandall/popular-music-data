Hey, baby
Why you going that way
Oh, sugar, come on
Go it my way

And I'm going to a place
Where funky people play
Oh, honey, we'll sing sure nuff
Dance the night away

Girl, you got that sexy smile
You move, it's driving me wild
Girl, I kinda kinda like your style
For you, I'd walk a country mile

Shake and dance with me
(Ooh, baby) every night and day
(Yeah, hey, hey, hey)
Shake and dance with me
Where funky people play

Oh, sugar, you got honey
Dripping off the walls
We might be tripping
Skinny-dipping
Making love in the halls

Oh, honey, your mind'll
Never be the same
No, darling, you don't
Have to be ashamed

Grooving is the game we play
Girl, we'll dance the night away
They'll be coming day by day
You'll always hear the people
Say, say, say, say

Shake and dance with me
(Ooh, ooh, yeah, well)
Every night and day
Shake and dance with me
Where funky people play
(Aw, play it again Sam)

One more time

Shake and dance with me
(Ooh, oh, ooh)
Every night and day (yeah, well)
Shake and dance with me
Where funky people play

Shake and dance with me
(Shake your body, well, well)
Every night and day (go on, baby)
Shake and dance with me
Where funky people play

Shake and dance with me...
