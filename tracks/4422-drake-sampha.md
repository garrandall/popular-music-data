I'm runnin', but can't run away
You say you changed
But you never change up

44, 22
You built it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call, 22
But you're just the same as I ever knew
44, 22
You built it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call, 22
But you're just the same as I ever knew
44, 22
You built it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call, 22
But you're just the same as I ever knew
44, 22
You built it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call, 22
But you're just the same as I ever knew
44, 22
You built it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call, 22
But you're just the same as I ever knew
44, 22
You built it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call, 22
But you're just the same as I ever knew
44

I know I fear trust
I know I fear fear too much
On my plate, lookin' up
Outer space, Pearly Gates

I'm runnin', but can't run away
You say you changed
But you never change up
