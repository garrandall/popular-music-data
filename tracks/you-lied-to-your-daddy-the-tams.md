You told me that your love was true,
But look at me girl, now I'm blue.
Because you cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, you cheat-cheat- cheated,
You cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, you cheat-cheat-cheated.
You gave your love so tenderly
And then you took it away from me.
You lied to me (you lied, you lied, you lied, you lied)

You ran around and then you put me down.
How could you be so cruel?
After I was so cruel to you, tell me why?

You lie.

You told me that your love was true,
But look at me girl, now I'm blue.
Because you cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, you cheat-cheat-cheated
Because you cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, you cheat-cheat-cheated
You gave your love so tenderly
And then you took it away from me.
You lied to me (you lied, you lied, you lied, you lied)

You lied, lied, lied, lied, you lied to your daddy
You lied, lied, lied, lied, you lied to your daddy
You cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, you cheat-cheat-cheated...
