Sitting in the shade of a rain soaked orange blossom
Wondering which way I can turn my sorrow
Now he's left me behind
Counting my bridges and wondering which way to cross 'em
Thinking of a way I can stop myself from crying

Thinking 'bout love that brought us together
Thinking 'bout love that keeps us apart
Wondering why the stormy weather
Always finds me, the peaceful heart

Good times, bad times, sometimes I used to be happy
Everything swung, even bells rung for me
Life was going my way
Sunshine, moonshine, what's the use of being happy
When all the time you know it's just got to fade away

Thinking 'bout love that brought us together
Thinking 'bout love that keeps us apart
Wondering why the stormy weather
Always finds me, the peaceful heart

Thinking 'bout love that brought us together
Thinking 'bout love that keeps us apart
Wondering why the stormy weather
Always finds me, the peaceful heart
