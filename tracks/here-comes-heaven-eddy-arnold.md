Here comes heaven all satin and lace
Love in her heart and a smile on her face
She's the world to me
Heaven is all my heart can see

Here comes heaven with soft golden hair
Laughing blue eyes that tell me she cares
She's my night my day
Heaven is just a kiss away

I was so lonely till she took my hand
She lifted in my eyes and she made me understand
Here comes heaven like spring soft and warm
I'd give my life to keep her from harm

She makes my heart sing
Here comes heaven again
Here comes heaven again...
