Miracle of miracles
Look what the night dragged in
It's a pocket full of misery
And trouble on the wind


You spoiled the best years of your life
You took them all in vain
Now you think that you're forgiven
But you can't be born again


And you say, why
You say, why
You say, why
Don't ask me, why


I don't love you anymore
I don't think I ever did
And if you ever had
Any kind of love for me
You kept it all so well hid


Promises, sweet promises
You kept them from your mind
Like all the lost forgotten things
You never seemed to find


Like all the disappointments
You displayed upon your shelf
Now you've got no-one to turn to
You've got no-one but yourself


And you say, why
You say, why
You say, why
Don't ask me, why


I don't love you anymore
I don't think I ever did
And if you ever had
Any kind of love for me
You kept it all so well hid


You spoiled the best years of your life
You took them all in vain
Now you think that you're forgiven
But you can't be born again

(2x)
And you say, why
Why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why

I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore

(2x)
And you say, why
You say, why
You say, why
Don't ask me, why
