Here we are
Hanging onto strains of greed and blues
Break the chain then we break down
Oh it's not real if you don't feel it
Unspoken expectations
Ideals you used to play with
They've finally taken shape for us

What's good enough for you
Is good enough for me
It's good enough
It's good enough for me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Now you'll say
You're startin' to feel the push and pull
Of what could be and never can
You mirror me stumblin' through those

Old fashioned superstitions
I find too hard to break
Oh maybe you're out of place

What's good enough for you
Is good enough for me
It's good enough
It's good enough for me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

(Good Enough) for you
Is good enough for me
It's good, it's good enough
It's good enough for me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Old fashioned superstitions
I find too hard to break
Oh maybe you're out of place

What's good enough for you
Is good enough for me
It's good enough
It's good enough for me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

(Good Enough) for you
Is good enough for me
It's good, it's good enough
It's good enough for me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

(Scat)
