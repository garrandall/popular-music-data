Oh don't it hurt deep inside
To see someone do something to her
Oh don't it pain to see someone cry
Especially if that someone is her

Silence is golden, but my eyes still see
Silence is golden, golden, but my eyes still see

Talking is cheap, people follow like sheep
Even though there is nowhere to go
How could she tell he deceived her so well
Pity, she'll be the last one to know

Silence is golden, but my eyes still see
Silence is golden, golden, but my eyes still see

Doo-wee-doo-wah-wah
Doo-wee-doo-wah-wah

How many times will she fall for his lines
Should I tell her or should I be cool
And if I tried, I know she'd say I lied
Mind your business don't hurt her you fool

Silence is golden, but my eyes still see
Silence is golden, golden, but my eyes still see

But my eyes still see
But my eyes still see
