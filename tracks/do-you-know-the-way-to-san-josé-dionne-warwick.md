Do you know the way to San JosÃ©?
I've been away so long 
I may go wrong and lose my way
Do you know the way to San JosÃ©?
I'm going back to find 
Some peace of mind in San JosÃ©

L.A. is a great big freeway
Put a hundred down and buy a car
In a week, maybe two 
They'll make you a star
Weeks turn into years, how quck they pass
And all the stars that never were
Are parking cars and pumping gas

You can really breathe in San JosÃ©
They've got a lot of space 
There'll be a place where I can stay
I was born and raised in San JosÃ©
I'm going back to find 
Some peace of mind in San JosÃ©

Fame and fortune is a magnet
It can pull you far away from home
With a dream in your heart you're never alone
Dreams turn into dust and blow away
And there you are without a friend
You pack your car and ride away
I've got lots of friends in San JosÃ©
Do you know the way to San JosÃ©?

Oh, L.A. is a great big freeway
Put a hundred down and buy a car
In a week, maybe two 
Tey'll make you a star
Weeks turn into years,how quick they pass
And all the stars that never were
Are parking cars and pumping gas
I've got lots of friends in San JosÃ©
Ohhhh, Do you know the way to San JosÃ©?
Hmmmm, Can't wait to get back to San JosÃ©
