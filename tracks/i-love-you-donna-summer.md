Well he searched and searched for nights and days
Till he found the one he loved
And he wrapped her in his arms again
And then he thanked the stars above
That he found what he'd been looking for
And he stared her in the eyes

He said "I love you"
He said "I love you"
Love you, love you

She stared him right back in the eyes
With a look of disbelief
Then she gazed off into somewhere else
Was it real or just a dream?
And she pulled him, oh so close to her
And she whispered in his ear

She said "I love you"
She said "I love you too"
Love you, love you, love you

So together they will always be
Until the stars fall from the sky

They said "I love you"
Yes, I really do
They said "I love you"
Yes, I do
I do, I do, I do, I do

So together they will always be
Until the stars fall from the sky
So if you find someone you love a lot
You must never let them go
You just hold them tight with all your might
And you say three little words

You say "I love you"
You say "I love you"
You say "I love you"
You say "I love you"
