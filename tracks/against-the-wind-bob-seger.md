Seems like yesterday
But it was long ago
Janey was lovely, she was the queen of my nights
There in darkness with the radio playin' low

And the secrets that we shared
Mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire out of control
'Til there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove

And I remember what she said to me
How she swore that it never would end
I remember how she held me oh so tight
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then

Against the wind
We were running against the wind
We were young and strong
We were running against the wind

The years rolled slowly past
And I found myself alone
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
Found myself further and further from my home and I

Guess I lost my way
There were oh so many roads
I was livin' to run and running to live
Never worried about payin' or even how much I owe

Movin' eight miles a minute for months at a time
Breakin' all of the rules that would bend
I began to find myself searchin'
Searchin' for shelter again and again

Against the wind
Little somethin' against the wind
I found myself seekin' shelter against the wind

Well, those drifters days are past me now
I've got so much more to think about
Deadlines and commitments
What to leave in, what to leave out

Against the wind
I'm still running against the wind
I'm older now but still running against the wind
Well, I'm older now and still running
Against the wind
Against the wind
Against the wind
Still running
Against the wind
I'm still running against the wind
Against the wind
I'm still running
Against the wind
I'm still running against the wind
Against the wind
Still running
Against the wind
Running against the wind, running against the wind
Against the wind
See the young man run
Against the wind
Watch the young man run
Against the wind
Watch the young man runnin'
Against the wind
He'll be runnin' against the wind
Against the wind
Let the cowboys ride
Against the wind
Mm
Against the wind
Let the cowboys ride
Against the wind
They'll be ridin' against the wind
Against the wind
Against the wind
Against the wind
Ridin' against the wind
Against the wind
Against the wind
