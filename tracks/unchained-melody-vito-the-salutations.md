Oh, my love, my darling
I've hungered for your
Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch
Whooo-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Much, much, much, much, much
Whooo-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Are you still mine
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me
Lonely rivers flow to the sea
To the sea
To the open arms of the sea
Lonely rivers sigh
Wait for me, wait for me
I'll be coming home, wait for me
Oh, my love, my darling
I've hungered for your
Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch
Whooo-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Much, much, much, much, much
Whooo-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Are you still mine
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me
Oh, my love, my darling
I've hungered for your
Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch
Whooo-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
