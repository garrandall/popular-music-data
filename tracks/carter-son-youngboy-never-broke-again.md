You're a Genius McFly
AI
It's the carters son
Turn me up a lil

Picture me new 3D denim I'm city rollin (rollin)
But did I mention this my own clothes
The fuck you mean
Made nigga bought me own rollie
But if them crackers pull me over they gon say I stole it
4 mornin we on it
I went bought two S trophies
My father left my sis and bros to them I feel I owe it
But let's not be heroic
Cause everybody roguish
They don't want us to totin guns but they let the fuckin killas tote it
Let's take a ride and see tho
Where them people be tho
Colt.45 they gripped his iron bought this bitch from kasino
Soprano no soprino
We live life like Yung Bino
Had a show in Bimo after that post on the block with Chino (imma hustlin mothefucka)
Look for a star on every hunnid c note
I'm the top on youtube
Fuck a new school ion use no b votes
These niggas round me they to cruel
They bust tools
And die for me tho
I don't pay money for no life
The murder pay off me so

Came out alright
But I'm black and from the life I can't see tho (nawfside, in the field, 4kt bitch)
Got juveniles on the block 30 stick hangin out the Glock
Bandanna tied round the clip
And they go all out for me tho

Sucked all the pain up
Let's fuck the game up
Plenty niggas on the block pushin that rock (Mr.Carters Son)
You got yo change up
They brought yo name up
When it's war we wet they block
And when it's set this shit'll never be pain
I can't say I'm fucking with all this evolving
These niggas ain right and they ballin
I don't give a fuck (no)
I call up Osama my papa
Like load up and come and rob all them (rob all them)
Venezuela be there later
My first trip to Georgia made us
So keep play with that bitch
Double G NBA native
I wish baptism could've saved us
Never bunk until the grave in
Excuse ourself knock on the tables
I make her pussy bite the pain
I can't say I'm fucking with all this evolving
These niggas ain right and they ballin
I don't give a fuck (no)
I call up Osama my papa
Like load up and come and rob all them

Came out alright
But I'm black and from the life I can't see tho
Got juveniles on the block 30 stick hangin out the Glock
Bandanna tied round the clip
And they go all out for me tho
