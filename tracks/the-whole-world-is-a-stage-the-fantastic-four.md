Mmm hm

The whole world is a stage
And everybody's playing a part
The stage is set
The curtain goes up
The scene is a broken heart

(Act one)
You told me you loved me
(Act one)
A grand opening start

(Act one)
You read your lines so perfectly
(Act one)
Like the words came straight
From your heart

And I believe you
The whole world is a stage
And everybody's playing a part

(Act two)
You forgot your makeup
(Act two)
And at last I saw the real you

(Act two)
Your heart was
Under your costume
(Act two)
But your eyes revealed
We were through

And I believe you
The whole world is a stage
And everybody's playing a part

(Act three)
You hear someone crying
But for me, it's a tragic end
But you, oh, make your exit
With the guy I thought
Was my friend

And I believe you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

The whole world is a stage
Yes, it is, baby
(And everybody's playing a part)
But now that the act is all over

(The whole world is a stage)
I can see you was nowhere
(And everybody's playing a part)
