I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry
Gone off the Belvey and âtron itâs too scary
Baby you can have whatever you like, the tooth fairy
Iâll do anything to leave here tonight with you
I said I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
(You know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do
(You know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do


I said now what it is, what it do, homegirl ainât got a clue
If I get you open all the things that I would do to you
Smack it up flip it down, weigh it up, break it down
Lean you to ya side yeah and ask ya whoâs ya daddy
Ainât even gotta open your eyes, know what youâre looking at
And I ainât even have to open my eyes when I was cooking that
Guess it was love at first sight, eye contact
Remember the night we first met, I caught a contact
Lest she my ride or die, itâs us against the world
You know we both hustlinâ so hustlinâ is our world
Said I musta had too much to drink Iâm in my G-Mode
So all the ladies repeat after me cause itâs the G-Code
Promise if I get locked, youâll come and pay my bond
If you hear some niggas plotting on me, youâll remain loyal
And errytime you give it to me itâs gon be the bomb
And in these unlucky streets youâre gonâ be my lucky charm



(Man, that boy so cold, give him a blanket in here)


I D-O, I D-O, I D-O oh oh oh
I be though, promise to treat this game, I D O
Under the cold, not bring drama to mamaâs peephole
Lifeâs a bitch but sheâs the only love that I know â oh oh
So la-a-dee, after the âI Doâsâ letâs do Mercedes
Letâs tie the knot, letâs grab us a pot, letâs make a baby
Looking back, I donât know who threw this bouquet to me
But I walk down this aisle faithfully, cut that cake for me
I Jay-Z, take this unlawful lady to have and to hold
And âtil the task force grow
To hug her every corner âtil I get ash from the cold
Or until Iâve amassed a fortune, too much cash for me to fold
Fold under pressure I would never, ever, ever, ever
Your secrets I treasure, for better or worser
Youâll always be my first love âtil death do us part
Pull a hearse up, my verse up




I do, I do, I do, I do
Uh, please put away the cameras,
Cause we just in the club getting MC Hammered
And God forbid we ever trade our wisdom for the glamour
And I know that Iâm just a boy that a woman can make a man of
So make me one I know that you can make me one
I just want a woman that looks 30 when sheâs 81
Please done give it all away I hope that you can save me some
The more they pass they heart around the more jaded that they become
But this oneâs special so I make that my suitâll fit
The one my daddy wore in June of 85â, Iâm too legit
Iâm just tryna get her in the mood
And have her doinâ all the things sheâd only do when she get married
So letâs do this sh*t
Tell the reverend all weâre missing is his blessing
Cuz before she popped the pussy she need me to pop the question
So we exchange vows, they clap we take a bow
And she be doing tricks for daddy when we take it to the house.




Nothings more attractive than a heavy praying woman
To a him and those and them been defecating on me (ughh)
Her would sense the heaven, and him when Andre omen
Baby Iâm hell, save me, donât bail
Crazy I tell you all of this in the middle of a club
Where words tend to get thrown around lightly like like like love
And friend and rockstar and so and soâs a genius
So him vow to never utter him do unless he mean it
Her proud like her mother and ohh mommaâs sweet
So you just know that Juicy fruit ainât gonâ fall too far from tree
So if we ever woop the woop
I want all that bleep to bleep
On this nasty carpet Bixby fresh on one knee
Say I do I do I do I do I do
So we can float up outta here in this hot air balloon
Letâs put a baby butterfly up in your lilâ cocoon
And maybe 2030 our baby, sheâll be nerdy make the whole club swoon
