I should laugh, but I cry
Because your love has passed me by
You took me by surprise
You didn't realize but I was waiting

Time goes slowly, but carries on
And now the best years have come and gone
You took me by surprise
I didn't realize that you were laughing

Laughing, cause you're doin' it to me
Laughing, it ain't the way it should be
You took away everything I had
You put the hurt on me

Laughing, cause you're doin' it to me
Laughing, it ain't the way it should be
You took away everything I had
You put the hurt on me

I go alone now, calling your name
After losing at the game
You took me by surprise
I didn't realize that you were laughing

Time goes slowly, but carries on
And now the best years
The best years have come and gone
You took me by surprise
I didn't realize that you were laughing

Laughing, cause you're doin' it to me
Laughing, it ain't the way it should be
You took away everything I had
You put the hurt on me

Laughing, cause you're doin' it to me
Laughing, it ain't the way it should be
You took away everything I had
You put the hurt on me

Laughing, ha ha ha ha ha ha
Laughing, ha ha ha ha ha ha
Laughing, what, you laughing at me?
Laughing, what, you laughing at me?

Laughing, oh, what you do on the weekend?
Laughing, I wanna look when you're laughing
Laughing, I wanna look when you're laughing
Laughing
