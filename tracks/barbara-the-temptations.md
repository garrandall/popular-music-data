Barbara
Barbara
Barbara, my love

If Barbara were an angel
I pray she'd watch over me
If Barbara were a queen
Her servant I would be

If Barbara would be mine
And wear my high school ring
Then I'd climb the highest mountain
Do just anything

If Barbara were the winter chill
I'd stand out in the cold
If Barbara were a tree
Her branches I would hold

If Barbara would love me
And say that she'd be mine
I'd swim the deepest ocean
Stop the hands of time

Barbara please say
(That you're the one in love with me)
Don't let me lead
(This life, this life of misery)
Oh, oh, oh

Let me kiss your tender lips
And know your secret charms
And let me know what real love is
And hold you in my arms

And if this love I pray for
Should it all come true
Then with all my heart, dear
I'd love no one but you

I'll hold you in my arms
For now and ever more
And we will walk together
Through love's sacred door

Barbara
Barbara
Barbara, my love

Barbara
Barbara
Barbara, my love

Barbara
Barbara
