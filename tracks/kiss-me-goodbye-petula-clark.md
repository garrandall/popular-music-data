We choose it
Win or lose it
Love is never quite the same
I love you
Now, I've lost you
Don't feel bad
You're not to late

So kiss me goodbye
And I'll try not to cry
All the tears in the world
Won't change your mind

There's someone new
And he's waiting for you
Soon your heart will be leaving me behind

Linger awhile
And I'll go with the smile
Like a friend
Who just happened to call

For the last time
Pretend you are mine
My darling
Kiss me goodbye

I know now
I must go now
Though my heart wants me to stay
That guy is your tomorrow
I belong to yesterday

So kiss me goodbye
And I'll try not to cry
All the tears in the world
Won't change your mind

There's someone new
And he's waiting for you
Soon your heart will be leaving me behind

Linger awhile
And I'll go with the smile
Like a friend
Who just happened to call

For the last time
Pretend you are mine
My darling
Kiss me goodbye

My darling
Kiss me goodbye
