And you said rise above
Open your eyes up
And you said rise above
But I can't
I can't

How long will it take
Before these feelings go away
How much longer do I wait
And are there any real answers
Anyway
Your silence in a crowded room

Louder than the loudest tune
I hang on every word
And you said rise above

Open your eyes up
And you said rise above
But I can't
I can't
I miss you in everything

I was too fast traveling
To take you in
I know, silence is no crime

Just wish I could hear you fill it up
One more time
Yes, I know what you'd say to me

Exactly what you said to me
I Still hang on every word
And you said rise above

Open your eyes up
And you said rise above
Yourself
In a time of treason

Is there time for trust
Where there's no them
Only us
Â¿Is there time for reason?
Has your heart had enough
Is it time to let go
And rise above?
And you said rise above
Open your eyes to LOVE
And you said rise above
Yourself
