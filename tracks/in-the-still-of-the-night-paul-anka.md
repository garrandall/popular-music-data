Shoo doop, shooby do

In the still of the night
I held you, held you tight
Cause I love, love you so
Promise I'll never let you go
In the still of the night
(In the still of the night)

I remember that night in May
The stars were bright above
I'll hope and I'll pray
To keep your precious love

Well, before the light
Love me again
With all your might
In the still of the night
(In the still of the night)

In the still of the night
(In the still of the night)
In the still of the night

Shoo doop, shooby do
