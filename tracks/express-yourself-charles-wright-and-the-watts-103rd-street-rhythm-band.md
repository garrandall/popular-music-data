Express Yourself!
Express Yourself!

You don't never need help from nobody else
All you got to do now:
Express Yourself!

What ever you do, uh, do it good, uh
What ever you do, do , do, Lord, Lord, do it good
All right...

It's not what you look like, when you're doin' what you're doin'
It's what you're doin' when you're doin' what you look like you're doin'!

Express Yourself!
Express Yourself!

They're doin' it on the moon, yeah, uh
In the jungle too, uh
Everybody on the floor, now, uh
Jumpin' like a kangaroo
So let the horns do the thing they do, yo...ah, uh, ow! Uh-uh uh uh

Some people have everything, and other people don't
But everything don't mean a thing if it ain't the thing you want

Express Yourself!
Express Yourself!

Oh, do it! Oh, do it
Do it to it, go on and do it
Yo, do it, give

Express Yourself!
Express Yourself

Uh! 

Uh, express yourself, uh express yourself
Uh express yourself
Uh express yourself
Express yourself
Express yourself
Express yourself
