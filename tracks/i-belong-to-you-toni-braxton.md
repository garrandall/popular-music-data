I wouldn't change
A single thing about you baby
You shower my world with your love

You got a way baby
About cha baby
That lets me know that
There's no other man

You take care of home
I was lost until I found you
Refuse to live without you
As long as you are good to me

I belong to you
You belong to me
I belong to you
The love we share comes naturally

I used to think
I knew love before I met you
You love my defenses down baby

I let you in
To my heart
And you unlocked true
love in me

I belong to you
You belong to me
I belong to you
The love we share comes naturally

So hard to find true love baby
Son't wanna live without you

I know this love is forever
Cause it shows in every little thing you do
Always make a way to see love through

I belong to you
You belong to me
I belong to you
The love we share comes naturally
