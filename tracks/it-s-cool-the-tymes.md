Strange places you've never been before
No smiling faces to help along the way
Your mind seems to be an open door
What's it for, whoa-oh...

Try to find a way to clean up your mind
Your lovely mother can't always dig a change
Over how your whole lifestyle has been so rearranged
Round and round the changes you go through
It's what you wanna do, whoa-oh...

Wanna do
It's what you wanna do
What you wanna do, whoa-oh...
What you wanna do

No, no, no, no, no

You should be cool
When you're foolin' with that stuff

Strange chances are poppin' in the air
Them rhyme tyme people, you can always find them there
Your mind is all about a doubt
You just can't work it out, whoa-oh...

Just can't work it out
Just can't work it out, whoa-oh...
Just can't work it out, whoa-oh...
Strange chances are poppin' in the air
Strange places you've never been before

Rhyme tyme people
Rhyme tyme people
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-woo-woo-woo
What you wanna do
What you wanna do

You should be cool, cool, cool
When you're foolin' with that stuff
