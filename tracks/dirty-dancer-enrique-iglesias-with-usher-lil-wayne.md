Enrique, Usher
This is for the dirty girls
All around the world
Here we go

Dirty dirty dancer

'Nother day, 'nother night
And she acting like she don't sleep
She's a five when she drinks
But she's a ten when she's on top of me

She don't wanna love she just wanna touch
She's a greedy girl to never get enough
She don't wanna love she just wanna touch
She's Got all the moves that make you get it up

She's a dirty dirty dancer dirty dirty dancer,
Never ever lonely
She's a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer
You'll never be her only

She's a dirty dirty dancer dirty dirty dancer,
Never ever lonely
She's a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer
You'll never be her only

It's a game
That she plays
She can win with her eyes closed
It's insane how she tames
She can turn you to an animal

She don't wanna love she just wanna touch
She's a greedy girl to never get enough
She don't wanna love she just wanna touch
She's got all the moves that make you give it up

She's a dirty dirty dancer dirty dirty dancer,
Never ever lonely
She's a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer
You'll never be her only

She's a dirty dirty dancer dirty dirty dancer,
Never ever lonely
She's a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer
You'll never be her only

Never be her only

She never satisfied
You better do it right
Before you're lonely

No, she's never satisfied
You better do it right
Before you're lonely

She's a dirty dirty dancer dirty dirty dancer,
Never ever lonely
She's a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer
You'll never be her only

She's a dirty dirty dancer dirty dirty dancer,
Never ever lonely
She's a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer
You'll never be her only
You'll never be her only

The girl don't stop
Dirty dancer

The girl don't stop
The girl don't stop
Dirty dancer

The girl don't stop
The girl don't stop
Dirty dancer

The girl don't stop
The girl don't stop
