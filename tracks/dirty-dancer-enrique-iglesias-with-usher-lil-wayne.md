Enrique, Usher
This is for the dirty girls
All around the world
Dirty dirty dancer
Woo!

Another day
Another night
And sheâs acting like she donât sleep
Sheâs a five when she drinks
But sheâs a ten when sheâs on top of me

Listen!

She donât want love
She just wanna touch
Sheâs a greedy girl to never get enough
She donât want love
She just wanna touch
Sheâs got all the moves
To make you give it up

Sheâs a dirty dirty dancer
Dirty dirty dancer never ever lonely
Sheâs a dirty dirty dancer
Dirty dirty dancer youâll never be her only
Sheâs a dirty dirty dancer
Dirty dirty dancer never ever lonely
Sheâs a dirty dirty dancer
Dirty dirty dancer youâll never be her only

Yeah yeah yeah

Itâs a game (ha!)
That she plays
She can win with her eyes closed

Itâs insane
How she tames
She can turn you into an animal

Yeah yeah yeah

She donât want love
She just wanna touch
Sheâs a greedy girl to never get enough
She donât want love
She just wanna touch
Sheâs got all the moves

To make you give it up

Yeah yeah yeah

Sheâs a dirty dirty dancer
Dirty dirty dancer never ever lonely
Sheâs a dirty dirty dancer
Dirty dirty dancer youâll never be her only (oh, noo)
Sheâs a dirty dirty dancer
Dirty dirty dancer never ever lonely
Sheâs a dirty dirty dancer
Dirty dirty dancer youâll never be her only (never be her only!)

She never satisfied
You better do it right
Before youâre lonely

No sheâs never satisfied
You better do it right
Before youâre lonely

Câmon


Hello baby itâs Weezy baby
Itâs going down, depreciating
Okay now I donât dance unless we dancing dirty
Skinny leather pants, Iâm on my Eddie Murphy
Shawty shake it fast like she in a hurry
I like the full glass, I like my Mary bloody
She ainât doing you and you ainât doing nothing
It ainât no money like Young Money

Sheâs a dirty dirty dancer
Dirty dirty dancer never ever lonely
Sheâs a dirty dirty dancer
Dirty dirty dancer youâll never be her only (come on!)
Sheâs a dirty dirty dancer
Dirty dirty dancer never ever lonely (never ever lonely)
Sheâs a dirty dirty dancer
Dirty dirty dancer youâll never be her only (never be her only!)
