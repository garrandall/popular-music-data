Let me just sit down and relax a minute
Let me tell you about it


Uh-huh, it's Friday
Uh-huh, thank God it's Friday, and I just got paid
Going across town
Gonna pick up my lady
Have a little bit of fun
Just ain't no telling where I might end up
You might see me on the East side, the West side
I'm even going cross the bridge
'Cause I, 'cause I, 'cause I hear they really get down over there


(Well, well, I)
Owe it to myself
(Well, well, I)
Gonna party
(Well, well, I)
Gonna party
(Well, well, I)
(Well, well, I)
I owe it to myself
(Well, well, I)
Oh, party, party


I'm just living, yeah
(Living for the weekend)
Woo hoo, said I'ma
(Living for the weekend)
I said right now, I'm
(Living for the weekend)
I said this evening
(Living for the weekend)
For the next two days
(Living for the weekend)
Gonna have a real good time
(Living for the weekend)
Gonna have a real, real, real good time
(Living for the weekend)
Gonna party hard, hard


Come on, y'all
Let's go downtown
Come on, y'all
Let's groove
Hey, hey


Monday to Thursday, I'm dead on my feet
Most of the time, too tired to eat
When I try to read the paper
I fall fast asleep
But as soon as Friday rolls around
I lay all my weekly burdens down
I put on my glad rags and paint the town


(Living for the weekend)
Friday night alive
(Living for the weekend)
Said I'm living for the weekend
(Living for the weekend)
Don't stop when I party down


Party hard, party down
Party hard, party down


As soon as on Monday rolls around again
I got to put all that partying to an end
Got to solve that same old grind
With those 5-day-a-week
Sometimes, I get frustrated through the day
Take off early and a cut in pay
At the time, I don't really care
Because I done took all that I can bear


(Living for the weekend)
(Living for the weekend)
(Living for the weekend)
That's when I party down

Monday
Tuesday
Wednesday
Thursday
Friday



Saturday
Saturday night
Sunday
Sunday night
