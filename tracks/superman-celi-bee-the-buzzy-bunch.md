Oh
You high baby?
Yaaahhh
Yah?
Talk to me
You want me to tell you something?
Uh huh
I know what you want to hear

A Cuz, I know you want me baby,
I think I want you too,
I think I love you baby,
I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl,
Come be in Shady's world,
I want to grow together,
Let's let our love unfurl

You know you want me baby,
You know I want you too,
They call me superman,
I'm here to rescue you

I want to save you girl,
Come be in Shady's world,
Oh boy you drive me crazy,
Bitch you make me earl...

They call me superman,
Leap tall hoes in a single bound,
I'm single now, got no ring on this finger now

I'd never let another chick bring me down,
In a relationship,
Save it bitch, babysit?
You make me sick

Superman ain't savin' shit,
Girl you can jump on Shady's dick

Straight from the hip,
Cut to the chase,
I tell a muthafuckin' slut, to her face
Play no games, say no names,
Ever since I broke up with what's her face

I'm a different man,
Kiss my ass, kiss my lips,
Bitch why ask? Kiss my dick,
Get my cash? I'd rather have you whip my ass

Don't put out, I'll put you out.
Won't get out, I'll push you out

Puss blew out, poppin' shit,
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out

Am I too nice?
Buy you ice?
Bitch if you died,
I wouldn't buy you life

What you tryin' to be my new wife?
What you Mariah? Fly through twice

But I do know one thing though, bitches, they come they go. Saturday through Sunday, Monday, Monday through Sunday yo/Maybe I'll love you one day, maybe we'll someday grow, till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho

Cus I can't be your Superman,
Can't be your Superman,
Can't be your Superman,
Can't be your Superman

I can't be your Superman,
Can't be your Superman,
Can't be your Superman,
Your Superman,
Your Superman

Don't get me wrong,
I love these hoes,
It's no secret,
Everybody knows
Yeah we fucked,
Bitch so what,
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends,
I'll call you again,
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kind of car I'll be in,
We'll see how much you'll be partying then
You don't want that, neither do I,
I don't want to flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride,
Between you and I,
Not a jealous man,
But females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do,
How could it ever be just us two?
I'd never love you enough to trust you,
We just met and I just fucked you

First thing you say,
I'm not fazed,
I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyways,
You're just plain old Marshall to me
Oh yah girl run that game,
Hailie Jade, I love that name,
Love that tatoo,
What's that say?
Rot in pieces?
Uh, that's great
First off you don't know Marshall,
At all so grow partial,
That's ammo for my arsenal,
I'll slap you off that barstool
There goes another lawsuit,
Leave handprints all across you,
Good Lordy whoadie,
You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have,
Ohgirl that's too damn bad,
Don't touch what you can't grab,
End up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a tampax,
And slap you till you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance,
Don't mean to ruin your plans
