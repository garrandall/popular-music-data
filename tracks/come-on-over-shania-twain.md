Get a life-get a grip
Get away somewhere, take a trip
Take a break-take control
Take advice from someone you know 
Come on over-come on in
Pull up a seat-take a load off your feet
Come on over-come on in
You can unwind-take a load off your mind 

Make a wish-make a move
Make up your mind-you can choose
When you're up-when you're down
When you need a laugh come around 

Come on over-come on in
Pull up a seat-take a load off your feet
Come on over-come on in
You can unwind-take a load off your mind 

Oh, oh, oh... 

Be a winner-be a star
Be happy to be who you are
Gotta be yourself-gotta make a plan
Gotta go for it while you can 

Come on over-come on in
Pull up a seat-take a load off your feet
Come on over-come on in
You can unwind-take a load off your mind 

Get a life-get a grip
Get away somewhere, take a trip
Take a break-take control
Take advice from someone you know 

Come on over-come on in
Pull up a seat-take a load off your feet
Come on over-come on in
You can unwind-take a load off your mind 

Oh, oh, oh...
