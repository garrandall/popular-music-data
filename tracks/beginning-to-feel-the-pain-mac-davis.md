I took the bad news standing up
Shrugged and poured myself
Another cup of coffee
Oh, you made good coffee

Too numb, too dumb to understand
You were really begging me to
Take command and make you stay
I just let you walk away

I'm just beginning to feel the pain
Clouds swelling up inside of me, Lord
And I think I'm gonna rain
Without my friends and my music
Lord, I would go insane

Like a dime in the pocket of a kid
There's a sad song
Burning a hole in my brain
(Burning a hole in my brain)

Last night I took a
Walk down the Sunset Strip
Found out that ain't half as hip
As it used to be, Lord
That ain't no place to be

Came home and wrote a song about you
But no one was there for me to sing it to
And the morning came
Somehow, morning's ain't the same

I'm just beginning to feel the pain
Clouds swelling up inside of me, Lord
And I think I'm gonna rain
Without my friends and my music
Lord, I would go insane

Like a dime in the pocket of a kid
There's a sad song
Burning a hole in my brain
(Burning a hole in my brain)

Woke up this morning
Drunk and disheveled
Looked in the mirror and there
Stood the Devil, plain as could be
Lord, was that really me

Got down and prayed to the Lord above
To send you back home and teach me
How to love and comfort you
Lord, what am I gonna do

I'm just beginning to feel the pain
Clouds swelling up inside of me, Lord
And I think I'm gonna rain
Without my friends and my music
Lord, I would go insane

Like a dime in the pocket of a kid
There's a sad song
Burning a hole (burning a hole)
Burning a hole (burning a hole)
In my brain

Beginning to feel that pain
(Beginning to feel)
Beginning to feel the pain
(Beginning to feel the pain)

Beginning to feel
(Beginning to feel)
Beginning to feel the pain
(Beginning to feel the pain)...
