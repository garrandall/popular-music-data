Asford-Marathon-Gulf-Getty-Americon
Texaco-Esso-Standard-Sunoco
Pay-Less-Hess-Gets-Regular-High-Test
Unleaded-Octane-No-Knocks
It's all the same

Get that gasoline
Get that gasoline
Get that gasoline
Oh, get that gasoline
Baby, your rest rooms sure are clean

And I was walkin' down the road
Carrying me a big gas can
I was walkin' down main street
Carrying me a big gas can
I went up to the attendent
I said, look here man

Gimme a dollar's worth
But the cat said the pump was dry
C'mon, at least give me a gallon
But you know the pump was dry
I got me a new hot rod
But I don't know why

I'd like to see you Jane
But my car ain't got no fuel
(Ain't got, got no gas)
I'd really like to see you baby
But I'm all out of fuel
(Ain't got, got no gas)
You know the way things is goin'
I might as well get me a mule
(Get me an ass)

Get that gasoline
Get that gasoline
Get that gasoline
Go, get that gasoline
(Ninety nine cents a gallon)
Baby, your rest rooms sure are clean

Get that gasoline
Get that gasoline
Get that gasoline
Get that gasoline
Baby, your rest rooms sure are clean
