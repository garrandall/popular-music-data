It's a thin line, it's 5 o'clock in the morning
And I'm just getting in, I knock on the door
A voice sweet and low says, who is it?
She opens up the door and lets me in
Never do she once say, sir, where have you been?
No, she says, are you hungry?
Are you hungry, honey?

Did you eat yet?

Let me hang up your coat, your coat, your coat

And the woman tells me, pass me your hat too
All the time she smiles, never raises her voice
It's 5 o'clock in the morning


It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate


The sweetest woman in the world
Can be the meanest woman in the world
If you make her that way
You keep on hurting her
She keeps being quiet
She might be holding something inside
That'll really really hurt you one day

Here I am laying in the hospital
Bandaged from feet to head
Ya see I'm in the state of shock baby
Just that much from being dead
I didn't think my woman could do something like this to me
I didn't think she had the nerve, so here I am
I guess action speaks louder than words


It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate


The sweetest woman in the world
Can be the meanest woman in the world
If you make her that way
You keep on hurting her
She keeps being quiet
She might be holding something inside
That could hurt you one day


It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate



It's a thin line (It's a thin line)
Between love and hate (You know it is)
It's a thin line

Shoobie-dab shoobie-dab shoobie-dab thin line

It's a thin line (It's a thin line)
Between love and hate (You know it is)
It's a thin line

Shoobie-dab shoobie-dab shoobie-dab thin line

It's a thin line
Between love and hate
It's a thin line

Shoobie-dab shoobie-dab shoobie-dab thin line
