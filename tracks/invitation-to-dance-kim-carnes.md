Invitation to dance
Invitation to romance
Invitation to dance
Invitation to dance

House lights down
My heart is the only sound
Spotlight, music begins and
That feeling takes me again

I close my eyes
Head over heels
You look my way

Whisper to me, come closer
Leaning on your shoulder (shoulder)
Loving the beholder, darling

Invitation to dance
(Give me an) invitation to romance
Invitation to dance
(I need an) invitation to dance

I'm lost in the song
I've been waiting here
For dreams too long

On the street, in my mind
Seeing the picture
Stopping the time

You tip your hat and then
I wave my heart goodbye
Given the wings I fly

To be there on your
Shoulder (shoulder)
Loving the beholder, darling

Invitation to dance
(I need an) invitation to romance
Invitation to dance
(It's just an) invitation to dance

Hot on the rhythm
Hot on the floor
That's where the magic begins

You don't need a reason
Give in to the beat
And go with the motion again

Invitation to dance
Invitation to romance
Invitation to dance
(I need an) invitation to dance

Invitation to dance
Invitation to romance
Invitation to dance
(Give me an) invitation to dance

Hot on the rhythm
Hot on the floor
That's where the magic begins

You don't need a reason
Give in to the beat
And go with the motion again

Hot on the rhythm
Hot on the floor
That's where the magic begins

You don't need a reason
Give in to the beat
Go with the motion again

Hot on the rhythm
Hot on the floor
That's where the magic begins

Don't need a reason
Give in to the beat
Go with the motion again

Hot on the rhythm
Hot on the floor
That's where the magic begins

You don't need a reason
Give in to the beat
Go with the motion again

Hot on the rhythm
Hot on the floor
That's where the magic begins

Don't need a reason
Give in to the beat
Go with the motion again

On the rhythm, on the floor
That's where the magic
Don't need a, to the beat
With the motion

Hot on the rhythm
Hot on the floor
That's where the
Magic begins, begins

Don't need a reason
Give in to the beat
Go with the motion again

Hot on the rhythm
On the floor, where the magic
Don't need a, to the beat
With the motion

To the beat

Invitation to dance
Invitation to romance
Invitation to dance
(Give me an) invitation to dance

Hot on the rhythm
Hot on the floor
That's where the magic begins

Don't need a reason
Give in to the beat
Go with the motion again

Hot on the rhythm
