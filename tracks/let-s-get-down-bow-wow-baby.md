Thinkin to myself like, this is the one
Broke her down, told shorty how to do this hun! (4-sho)
Neva gave her tha cold shoulda'
If she's in the benz, I let her take ova' the Rova (vrrm-Vrrm!)
Then it's off to the movies, tell her

From tha movies to tha crib
Git her(?) for ya heard that's what I did, And! (ok)

She lives on the west side I hit the L.A.X (ok)
I'm so impressed by the way that she dress (she got gear)
She walks like a model, the girl is so fresh (so fresh)

Couldn't believe when I seen
How she sqeezed in them jeans
Looks like a tight situation
Make a young man make flight reservations
Just step, no intimidations
I'm bow wow boo
Accept no imitations
Should have seen tha looks on they faces
The Ice plus light, makes for good converation
You tellin me
It's a felony, to yell at me
I blew her mind she was dazed momentarily
But luckily
She stayed for some theropy
I stay pimpin heavily
My game spittin therolly (ha ha ha)
