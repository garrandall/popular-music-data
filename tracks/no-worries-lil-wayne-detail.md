Look me in my face
I ain't got no worries
I ain't got no worries
I ain't got no worries
See them shroomies keep me up
So I ain't got no worries
I ain't got no worries
I ain't got no worries
You see money, right there
That's Tunechi, right there
Yeah that's Mack Maine, right there
And we ain't got no worries
You see pussy, right there
Red bone mangoes right there
See them shroomies, right there
We ain't got no worries


See that pistol off of my waist
So I ain't got no worries
Got them snowflakes in my chain so them diamonds glowin' in flurries
Got your chicken all in my face, tryin' to feed me all of that curry
And I was 'bout to eat the shit up, but that kitty cat was too furry
And I'm like "baby girl you crazy - baby girl you crazy"
I'm not lazy I got Bronco up in that pussy, Willis McGahee
You should pay me just to fuck you
Few stacks, just pluck you
I got golden arms, platinum fingers
It's a privilege for me to just touch you bitch
Yeah... got your buddy all in my whip
Got 'bout 20 strong in my clip
And my money long as my dick
I watch birds fly on my strip
I watch herbs die my strip
I watch slugs fly on my grip
Anytime them fucks high on my chips
See that Villain, so trill
That Villain boy so trill
I'm top shelf in that supermarket and all you niggas no frills
That black card in my pocket, I ain't spendin' no bills
Drop that molly in the champagne
Why? 'Cause I ain't takin' no pills




It's Busta Buss in the place
And I ain't got no worries
'Cause I'm bustin' all in her face
'Til her vision start to get blurry
Yeah, see me 'bout to get straight to it
And we getting to this shit early
Oh man, oh Lord, of his mercy
See the way we got 'em all thirsty
Bitch come and ride with me on this journey
Come and straddle on my beef jerky
I'm a make her sweat, the more we get dirty
Bitch had a perm but now her shit curly
It's Young Money right here
It's The Conglomerate right here
See all this bread that I'm a peel off
When I get to buyin' everything up in here
Shit getting' hot and gettin' all humid
Poppin' that molly, actin' all stupid
When they ask who the nicest in the circle
Don't be mad 'cause your name ain't included
If you need water flow be like fluids
See the way we comin' in suited and booted
When I finish with 'em I leave 'em all wounded
Bitch you ain't knowin' my Level Five mutant
See how this shit is really going
Acting like they ain't knowing
Got a nigga really digging in they pocket
And every time I ask they open and closin'
Look I hope you know what the fuck, what this shit is
When I dig in your stomach and you curse me
Go ahead and angle the pussy a whole other way
I ain't got no worries, biatch!
