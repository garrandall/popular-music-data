Wise men say, only fools rush in,
But I can't help falling in love with you.
Shall I stay, would it be a sin?
If I can't help falling in love with you.

Like a river flows, slowly to the sea,
Darling so it goes,
Some things are meant to be.

Take my hand, take my whole life too.
For I can't help falling in love with you.

(Like a river flows, slowly to the sea,
Darling so it goes,)

Some things are meant to be.
Take my hand, take my whole life too.
For I can't help falling in love with you,

For I can't help falling in love with you.
