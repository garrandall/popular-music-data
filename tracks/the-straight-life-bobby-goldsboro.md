Sometimes I imagine myself as a drifter
Seeker of fortunes, connoisseur of great wines
Dashing through meadows of yellow and green
Trying to catch the impossible dream
Leavin' the straight life behind

Sometimes my thoughts may find me in Mexico
Drinkin' tequila goin' out of my mind
Havin' a ball on a couple 'a bob
Treatin' the ladies to corn on the cob
Leavin' the straight life behind

Suddenly all my silly thoughts disappear
She comes to me softly with crackers and beer
Winkin' and blinkin' and blowin' in my ear
Runnin' away with my mind

It's great to be in love, I'm not really thinkin' of
Leavin' the straight life behind
I'm just playin' a game in my mind

Once in a while in my mind I go bummin'
Goin' to nowhere, with no worry of time
Runnin' along chasin' after a train
Hummin' a song in the sun and the rain
Leavin' the straight life behind

I can just see me on a tropical island
Ridin' the surf and drinkin' coconut wine
Havin' me fun with golden girls in the sand
Chasin' the sun through an innocent land
Leavin' the straight life behind

Suddenly all my silly thoughts disappear
She comes to me softly with crackers and beer
Winkin' and blinkin' and blowin' in my ear
Runnin' away with my mind

It's great to be in love, I'm not really thinkin' of
Leavin' the straight life behind
I'm just playin' a game in my mind
