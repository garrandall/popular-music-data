(Up on the roof)
(Up on the roof)


When this old world starts getting me down
And people are just too much for me to face (Up on the roof)
I climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right into space (Up on the roof)

On the roof, it's peaceful as can be
And there, the world below can't bother me
Let me tell you now


When I come home feeling tired and beat
I go up where the air is fresh and sweet (Up on the roof)
I get away from the hustlin' crowds
And all that rat race noise down in the street (Up on the roof)

On the roof's the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Let's go up on the roof (Up on the roof)

At night, the stars put on a show for free
And, darling, you can share it all with me
I keep-a tellin' you

Right smack dab in the middle of town
I found a paradise that's trouble-proof (Up on the roof)
And if this world starts getting you down
There's room enough for two up on the roof (Up on the roof)


Up on the roof (Up on the roof)
Oh, come on, baby (Up on the roof)
Oh, come on, honey (Up on the roof)
Everything is all right (Up on the roof)
