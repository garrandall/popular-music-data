Ooh, baby, ooh, baby
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby...
Want you so bad
Can't even get mad at you
What a thing, you really swing
And I feel so good, it's true
You said you're gonna make my lung
Start breathing in the air
Through loving you
I really know, child
Just how much I care
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Ooh, baby
Give me such a tingle
All down along my side
I can't remove my?
Give love all the night
I want to be part of you
Keep our feeling tight
Keep the faith in all
Cause everything is alright
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Ooh, baby
I need your love
Ooh, baby
I want your love
Ooh, baby
Ooh, baby...
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Ooh, child
Prepared for tomorrow
Do what you have to do
I'll share the weight
Whatever fate plans
To bring to you
Don't worry 'bout no attitude
You just be yourself
Could live with you in solitude
And need no one else
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
