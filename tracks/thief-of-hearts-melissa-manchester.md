Somewhere deep inside of a stranger's eyes
There are stranger things I see
Shades of light on a secret part of me
Living in the shadows hiding from my life
I was waiting for a dream
Now a perfect stranger fills my needs

Thief of hearts
Stole my heart from me
Thief of hearts
Better than a dream
The thief of hearts

Hands upon my body full of cool control
Baby tell me how you knew
Everything that felt so good to me
Now I see you clearer through your one-way mirror
Real, but too surreal
Turn the pages
You're a memory

Thief of hearts
Stole my heart from me
Thief of hearts
Better than a dream
The thief of hearts

When I think about my soul
All the secrets that you stole
Then I know that I've just got to let you go

Thief of hearts
Stole my heart from me
Thief of hearts
Better than a dream
The thief of hearts

Thief of hearts
Stole my heart from me
Thief of hearts
Better than a dream
...
