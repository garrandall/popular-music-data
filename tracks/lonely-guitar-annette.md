Lonely guitar
Is there no one who loves us
Lonely guitar
Not a soul seems to care
The stars in the sky
Look like teardrops
Because I've been crying
And the breeze seems to
Sigh as I whisper my
Penance and prayer
Lonely guitar (lonely guitar)
Now our song is a sad song
Longing, we are, for
Someone to adore
(Lonely guitar)
Some sunny day
There may come our way
One who will love us
Then my lonely guitar
You and I will be
Lonely no more
(Lonely guitar)
Is there no one who loves us
(Lonely guitar)
Not a soul seems to care
Some sunny day
There may come our way
One who will love us
Then my lonely guitar
You and I will be
Lonely no more
(Lonely guitar)
