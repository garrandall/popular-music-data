Listen to the ground:
There is movement all around.
There is something goin' down
And I can feel it.

On the waves of the air,
There is dancin' out there.
If it's somethin' we can share,
We can steal it.

And that sweet city woman,
She moves through the light,
Controlling my mind and my soul.
When you reach out for me
Yeah, and the feelin' is right,

Then I get night fever, night fever.
We know how to do it.
Gimme that night fever, night fever.
We know how to show it.

Here I am,
Prayin' for this moment to last,
Livin' on the music so fine,
Borne on the wind,
Makin' it mine.

Night fever, night fever.
We know how to do it.
Gimme that night fever, night fever.
We know how to show it.

In the heat of our love,
Don't need no help for us to make it.
Gimme just enough to take us to the mornin'.
I got fire in my mind.
I get higher in my walkin'.
And I'm glowin' in the dark;
I give you warnin'.

And that sweet city woman,
She moves through the light,
Controlling my mind and my soul.
When you reach out for me
Yeah, and the feelin' is right,

Then I get night fever, night fever.
We know how to do it.
Gimme that night fever, night fever.
We know how to show it.

Here I am,
Prayin' for this moment to last,
Livin' on the music so fine,
Borne on the wind,
Makin' it mine.

Night fever, night fever.
We know how to do it (Feels like forever baby, don't you know)
Gimme that night fever, night fever.
We know how to show it (I'll leave you never baby, don't you know)

Night fever, night fever.
We know how to do it (Feels like forever baby, don't you know)
Gimme that night fever, night fever.
We know how to show it (I'll leave you never baby, don't you know)

Night fever, night fever.
We know how to do it (Feels like forever baby, don't you know)
