Star light, star bright
First star I see tonight
I wish I may, I wish I might
Have the wish I wish tonight

Star light, star bright
First star I see tonight
I wish I may, I wish I might
Have the wish I wish tonight

Shine down, star light
Please help to make this our night
The one I love will be here soon
Please shine above and bring the moon

If he should take me riding
Far away from the city
Cover me with your magic glow
Make him think I'm oh so pretty

Star light, star bright
First star I see tonight
Can't you hear my wish to you
Won't you help my dreams come true

Star light, star bright
First star I see tonight
Can't you hear my plea to you
Won't you make my dreams come true

Ohh that pretty star light
Hey look at that star light
