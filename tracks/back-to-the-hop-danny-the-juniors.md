Let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go, everybody
Back to the hop

Well, it's Saturday night
I got a dollar in my pocket
(Dollar in my pocket)

I'm going back to the hop
And I'm really gonna rock it
(Really gonna rock it)

I heard the jockey on the radio
Announce it today
(Shop, shop, doo, wop)
(Shop, shop, shoo, wop)

He said he's got a lot of records
He'll be giving away
(Giving away)

So, put your twisting dress on
'Cause we gotta be gone
Back to the hop, oh, yeah

We'll do the twist
(Around and around and around and around)
And then we'll fish
(Do the fish, do the fish, hey, hey)
Pony time is so doggone fine
(Boogity, boogity, boogity, boogity, shoop)

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, everybody
Back to the hop

Well, a lot a famous record stars
Are making the scene
(Making the scene)

You know, a cat from South Philly
And a guy from New Orleans
(Guy from New Orleans)

They're gonna sing to the records
While the kids all shout
(Shop, shop, doo, bop)
(Shop, shop, shoo, bop)

And then they'll autograph their pictures
Then they'll pass them out
(Pass them out)

You know it's lots of fun
Come on, we better run
Back to the hop, oh, yeah

We'll do the twist
(Around and around and around and around)
And then we'll fish
(Do the fish, do the fish, hey, hey)
Pony time is so doggone fine
(Boogity, boogity, boogity, boogity, shoop)

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, everybody
Back to the hop
