When my legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

And, darling, I will be loving you 'til we're 70
(You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse)
And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
(I can't believe you let me down
But the proof is in the way it hurts)
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
(For months on end I've had my doubts)
Maybe just the touch of a hand
(Denying every tear)                                           
Me-I fall in love with you 
(Every single day)
(And I just wanna tell you I am)
So, baby, now

(You say I'm crazy)
Take me into your loving arms
(Cause you don't think I know what you've done)
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
(But when you call me baby)
Place your head on my beating heart
(I know I'm not the only one)
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe,
(We found love right where we are)

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
(You've been so unavailable)
And the crowds don't remember my name
(Now sadly I know why)
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
(Your heart is unobtainable)
I know you will still love me the same
(I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways)
Cause your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
(Maybe it's all part of a plan)
(Baby I'll just keep on making the same mistakes)
(Hoping that you'll understand)
But, baby, now

(You say I'm crazy)
Take me into your loving arms
(Cause you don't think I know what you've done)
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
(But when you call me baby)
Place your head on my beating heart
(I know I'm not the only one)
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe,
(We found love right where we are)

I have loved you for many years
(Maybe I am just not enough)
Ooohooo
(You've made me realize my deepest fear)
(By lying) Oh
(And tearing) Oh (Us up)
So, Baby, now

(You say I'm crazy)
Take me into your loving arms
(Cause you don't think I know what you've done)
Oh, Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
(But when you call me baby)
Place your head on my beating heart
(I know I'm not the only one)
I'm thinking out loud
(And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know ohh)

(I know I'm not the only one)
We found love right where we are
