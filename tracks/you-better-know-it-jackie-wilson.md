Well I want you to run to me baby
Run with all your might
I want to love you pretty baby
Till the broad day light
Want to thrill you pretty momma
Till the sun don't shine
Satisfy your soul before I loose my mind

You better know it cause its me and you
You better know it, this is what I do
You better know it for the rest of your life
You better listen to me and you better hear what I say

Why pretty baby can't you understand
That I want to be your lovin man
Gonna love you pretty baby with all my heart
But tell me pretty momma that we will never part
You better know it
You better know it
You better know it
You better listen to me and you better hear what I say

A river's a river, a sea is a sea
And I want you to belong to me
If they says it goes together like a road with bumps
Then I got the measles and you got the mumps

You'd better know it, yeah
You'd better know it
You'd better know it

You'd better listen to me and you better hear what I say

Come along, baby, come along
You'd better come along
I love you baby can't you plainly see
Well, come on, come on, come on, come on,
You can love me, come on, you can hug me, come on
You can squeeze me, well come on
Come, come on come a right along baby
Just come on love me honey
Love me long, love me right, love me strong
Yes, come on, come on, come right along
