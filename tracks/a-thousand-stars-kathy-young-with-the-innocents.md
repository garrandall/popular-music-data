A thousand stars in the sky like the stars in your eyes

They say to me that there'll never be

No other love like you for me

A thousand stars in the sky make me realize

You are the one love that I'll adore

Tell me you love me

Tell me you're mine once more

Once more, once more

Each night I count the stars in the sky

Hoping that you aren't telling me lies

You're with me tonight, I'm captured by your charms

Oh, pretty baby, won't you hold me in your arms?

A thousand stars in the sky make me realize

You are the one love that I'll adore

Tell me you love me

Tell me you're mine once more

Once more, once more

Each night I count the stars in the sky

Hoping that you aren't telling me lies

You're with me tonight, I'm captured by your charms

Oh, pretty baby, won't you hold me in your arms?

A thousand stars in the sky make me realize

You are the one love that I'll adore

Tell me you love me

Tell me you're mine once more

I'm yours
