I swear by the moon
And the stars in the sky
And I swear like the shadow that's by your side


I see the questions in your eyes
I know what's weighing on your mind
You can be sure I know my part
Cause I stand beside you through the years
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I make mistakes
I'll never break your heart


And I swear by the moon
And the stars in the sky I'll be there
I swear like the shadow that's by your side
I'll be there for better or worse
Till death do us part
I'll love you with every beat of my heart
And I swear
Oooh


I'll give you everything I can
I'll build your dreams with these two hands
We'll hang some memories on the walls
And when (and when) just the two of us are there
You won't have to ask if I still care
Cause as the time turns the page
My love won't age at all


And I swear (I swear) by the moon
And the stars in the sky I'll be there (I'll be there)
I swear (and I swear) like the shadow that's by your side
I'll be there (I'll be there) for better or worse
'Til death do us part I'll love you
With every beat of my heart and I swear
Oh yeah

I swear (I swear) by the moon
And the stars in the sky I'll be there (I'll be there)
I swear like the shadow that's by your side
I'll be there (I'll be there)
For better or worse (better or worse)
Till death do us part (oh no) I'll love you
With every single beat of my heart
I swear
I swear
Oh, I swear
