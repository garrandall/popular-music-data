Each night when watching dying of the day
I seem to find I hardly know my way around

Even with the crowd I'm on my own
Now she's gone
I don't know if I'm lost or found

You're bringing me down dear Delilah
I can see you hanging around dear Delilah

It's hard to realise and harder to see-ee
And harder still when someone tells you
She wanted someone else that I couldn't be

You're bringing me down dear Delilah
I can see you coming around dear Delilah

Wind blown and I'm falling with the wind
Was I too fast or too slow
Or did the weather change

You're bringing me down dear Delilah
I can see you coming around dear Delilah

And when you ask me if I need her I do-oh
But ask me why and I can't tell you
I only know that she means so much to me

You're bringing me down dear Delilah (yeh yeh)
I can see you coming around dear Delilah

You're bringing me down dear Delilah (yeh yeh)
I can see you coming around dear Delilah

You're bringing me down dear Delilah (yeh yeh)
I can see you coming around dear Delilah
