Dearly beloved, if this love only exists in my dreams
Don't wake me up


Too much light in this window, don't wake me up
Only coffee, no sugar inside my cup
If I wake and you're here still, give me a kiss
I wasn't finished dreaming about your lips


Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up
Don't wake me up, don't wake me


Don't wake me up, up
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me up, yeah
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up
Don't wake me up, don't wake me


So much life in the city, you won't believe
Been awake for some days now, no time to sleep
If your heart is a pillow, this love's the bed
Tell me what is the music inside my head


Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up
Don't wake me up, don't wake me


Don't wake me up, up, up
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me up, yeah
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up
Don't wake me up, don't wake me


I don't wanna fall, fall, fall, fall asleep, no
I don't wanna fall unless I'm falling for you
I don't wanna fall, fall, fall, fall asleep, no
I don't wanna fall unless I'm falling for you


Don't wake me up, up, up
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me up, yeah
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up
Don't wake me up, don't wake me
