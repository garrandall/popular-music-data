I don't know, what happened to the love we shared
Don't go, sometimes I think it's just not fair
I know, the pain I feel inside my heart
I wish I'd known it from the start
That you would come and break my heart
I can't hold back these tears in my eyes
The feeling of pain inside because...


I'm dreaming of love, thinking of you
Remembering times that we once shared
Dreaming of love, thinking of you
Knowing someday you'll come back to my life

I try to love, but it just don't feel the same
Our love, comes once in a lifetime
I'll take the blame
God above, hear my prayer
Bring her back to me
I wish I'd known you from the start
That you would come and break my heart
I can't hold back these tears in my eyes
The feeling of pain inside because...

I, I'm dreaming of...
I am dreaming of love

I don't know, why did you leave me all alone
Our love, comes once in a lifetime
I'll take the blame
Now I know, true love I feel inside my heart
I wish I'd known it from the start
That you would come and break my heart
I can't hold back these tears in my eyes
The feeling of pain inside because...
