She got legs, she knows how to use them
She never begs, she knows how to choose them
She's holdin' leg wonderin' how to feel them
Would you get behind them if you could only find them?
She's my baby, she's my baby
Yeah, it's alright

She's got hair down to her fanny
She's kinda jet set, try undo her panties
Everytime she's dancin' she knows what to do
Everybody wants to see if she can use it
She's so fine, she's all mine
Girl, you got it right

She got legs, she knows how to use them
She never begs, she knows how to choose them
She got a dime all of the time
Stays out at night movin' through time
Oh, I want her, shit, I got to have her
The girl is alright, she's alright
