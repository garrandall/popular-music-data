I knew you when
I had a friend
Very deeply
Love lived within
But somehow we got loose
From what was oh so tight
Somewhere we went wrong
When we were oh so right


What's a man to do when he just can't take no more?
What's a man to do?
What am I to do when my heart leads me to the door?
Now I've tried and tried again
But now this is the end
Tell me what's the use of holding on
If we can't be friends


I'm emotional
And I can't let go
I am trying to hold on to you
(I'm trying to hold on to you)
Though it hurts me so
Gotta let you know
That the love we once shared now is through
Say goodbye to you


You seem to hurt me purposely
I didn't understand it
Oh girl, why me?
I had no choice
What was best for us
Was to terminate our love and be free


What's a man to do when he just can't take no more?
Oh, what's a man to do?
What am I to do when my heart leads me to the door?
Now we've tried and tried again
But now this is the end
Tell me what's the use of holding on
If we can't be friends


I'm emotional
And I can't let go
I am trying to hold on to you
Though it hurts me so
Gotta let you know
That the love we once shared now is through
Say goodbye to you


What's a man to do when he just can't take no more?
What's a man to do?
What am I to do when my heart leads me to the door?
Now we've tried and tried again
But now this is the end
Tell me what's the use of holding on
If we can't be friends


I'm emotional
And I can't let go
I am trying to hold on to you (I'm trying, I'm trying)
Though it hurts me so
Gotta let you know (Gotta let you go, gotta let you know)
That the love we once shared now is through
Say goodbye to you

I'm emotional (How emotional)
And I can't let go
I am trying to hold on to you
(I can't stop crying, my heart is slowly dying)
Though it hurts me so
Gotta let you know
That the love we once shared now is through
(The love that we once shared, you know it's through)
