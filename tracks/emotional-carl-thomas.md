Uh, oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
(Emotional)

I always dreamed that everything would be okay
With me and you, but I was wrong
When I looked into your eyes
I didn't see all the things I used to see
What's going on?


You gave me reason to believe that
We were always meant to be
But now I see, you were wrong
You can't keep running back to me
With all those "Baby, baby please"-s
No more, no more


Never imagined
You would be a faded picture
I'm emotional
You saw me leaving
No deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional


I can't forget that night I saw you in the corner
Wrapped up tight, you were wrong ooh
Slow dancing on the floor
While I was watching from the door
So hurt, there you were





You had your chance
But you through it all away
Thought you had my love always
Oh baby, I don't understand
Why you think that we could stay in total unhappiness
