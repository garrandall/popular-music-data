The sun comes up and brings the dawn
As usual
When I awake I'll find you gone
As usual

But I can't find a way to let
This crazy heart of mine forget
I pretend you're still beside me
As usual

Each evening I take a walk
As usual
I make believe that we still talk
As usual

People always stop and stare
I guess they just don't see you there
Don't they know you'll always be right here
As usual

Today I looked into my mirror
As usual


(I told myself that you're still here
As usual)

And as I stood there telling lies
The tears began to fill my eyes
Cause I know I'm only fooling myself
As usual
