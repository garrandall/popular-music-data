Read in the paper nearly day 
People breakin' up and just walkin' away from love and that's wrong 
That's so wrong 

A happy little home comes up for sale 
Because two fools have tried and failed to get along 
And ya know that's wrong 

A man hurts a woman and a woman hurts a man 
When neither one of them will love and understa-a-a-a-and 
And take it with a grain of salt 
Oh, now believe that 

A little bit of love is better than no love 
Even the bad love is better than no love 
And even the sad love is better than no love at a-l-l 
Got to believe that 
A little bit of love is better than no love 
Even the bad love is better than no love 
And any kind of love is better than no love at all 

Nah-nah-nah-nah 
Nah-nah-nah-nah 
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah 

No love at all is a poor old man 
Standin' on the corner with his hat in his hand 
And no place to go, he's feelin' low 
No love at all is a child in the street 
Dodgin' traffic and beggin' to eat on a tenement row 
And that's a long row to hoe 
No love at all is a troubled young girl 
Standin' on a bridge at the end of the wor-or-or-or-ld 
And it's a pretty short fall 
Now people believe me 

A little bit of love is better than no love 
Even the bad love is better than no love 
And even the sad love is better than no love at a-l-l 
Got to believe that 
A little bit of love is better than no love 
Even the bad love is better than no love 
And any kind of love is better than no love at all 

Nah-nah-nah-nah 
Nah-nah-nah-nah 
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah 

Oh you got to believe me 

A little bit of love is better than no love 
Even the bad love is better than no love 
And even the sad is better than no love at a-l-l 
Got to believe me 
A little bit of love is better than no love 
Even the bad love is better than no love 
And any kind of love is better than no love at all 

Got to believe me 


A little bit of love is better than no love 
Even the bad love is better than no love 
And any kind
