Come on, come on children now.
Come on, sing to me
Come on, come on children
Let's shout until the break of day

Come on, come on children now.
Come on, sing to me
Come on, come on children
Let's sing and shout our blues away

If you're broken hearted and you're burdened down with sorrow
'Cause the world ain't treatin' you right
Well, listen to me brother, if we sing to one another
You'll go home feelin' better tonight

Come on, come on children now.
Come on, sing to me
Come on, come on children
Let's sing and shout our blues away

If you're broken hearted and you're burdened down with sorrow
'Cause the world ain't treatin' you right
Well, listen to me brother, if we sing to one another
You'll go home feelin' better tonight

Come on, come on children now.
Come on, sing to me
Come on, come on children
Let's sing and shout our blues away

Come on, come on children now.
Come on...
