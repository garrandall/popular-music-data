Brother bought a coconut, he bought it for a dime
His sister had another one, she paid it for a lime
She put the lime in the coconut, she drank them both up
She put the lime in the coconut, she drank them both up
She put the lime in the coconut, she drank them both up

She put the lime in the coconut, she called the doctor, woke him up
And said, Doctor, ain't there nothin' I can take
I say, doctor, to relieve this bellyache?
I say, doctor, ain't there nothin' I can take
I say, doctor, to relieve this bellyache?

Now let me get this straight
You put the lime in the coconut, you drank them both up
You put the lime in the coconut, you drank them both up
Put the lime in the coconut, you drank them both up

Put the lime in the coconut, you called your doctor, woke him up
And said, Doctor, ain't there nothing I can take
I said, Doctor, to relieve this bellyache?
I said, Doctor, ain't there nothin' I can take
I said, Doctor, to relieve this bellyache?

You put the lime in the coconut, you drink 'em both together
Put the lime in the coconut, then you feel better
Put the lime in the coconut, drink 'em both up
Put the lime in the coconut, and call me in the morning

Whoo-whoo-whoo, whoo-oh-oh, whoo-oh-oh
Whoo-whoo-whoo, whoo-oh-oh, whoo-oh-oh
Whoo-whoo-whoo, whoo-oh-oh, whoo-oh-oh
Whoo-whoo-whoo, whoo-oh-oh, whoo-oh-oh

Brother bought a coconut, he bought it for a dime

She put the lime in the coconut, she drank them both up

And put the lime in the coconut, she called the doctor, woke him up

I said, Doctor, to relieve this bellyache?
I said, Doctor, ain't there nothin' I can take?
I said, Doctor

Now let me get this straight
You put the lime in the coconut, you drink 'em both up
Put the lime in the coconut, you drink 'em both up
Put a lime in the coconut, you drink 'em both up

Put the lime in the coconut, you such a silly woman
Put a lime in the coconut and drink 'em both together
Put the lime in the coconut, then you feel better
Put the lime in the coconut, drink 'em both down
Put the lime in the coconut, and call me in the morning

Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo, ain't there nothin' you can take
I say, whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo, to relieve your bellyache
You say, well, whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo, ain't there nothing I can take
I say, whoo-whoo, to relieve your bellyache
You say, yeah, ain't there nothin' I can take
I say, waah waah, to relieve this bellyache

I say, Doctor, ain't there nothin' I can take?
I say, Doctor, ain't there nothing I can take?
I say, Doctor, ain't there nothing I can take?
I say, Doctor

You're such a silly woman
Put the lime in the coconut and drink them both together
Put the lime in the coconut, then you feel better
Put the lime in the coconut, drink 'em both up
Put the lime in the coconut, and call me in the mo-o-o-o-orning

Yes, you call me in the morning
If you call me in the morning, I'll tell you what to do
If you call me in the morning, I'll tell you what to do
If you call me in the morning, I'll tell you what to do
If you call me in the morning, I'll tell you what to do
Well, if you call me in the morning, I'll tell you what to do
