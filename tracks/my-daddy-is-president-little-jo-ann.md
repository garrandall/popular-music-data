My daddy is president,
What does your daddy do?
I live in a big white house
On Pennsylvania Avenue.

I always hide behind
The desk in daddy's den
When I play hide-and-seek
With secret service men.

My daddy is president,
We had a busy day.
I'm learning the alphabet:
A-B-C-D-J-F-K.

I don't play house,
I play the game of government.
'Cause my daddy is the president.

At daddy's first press conference,
I made news,
Wearing mommy's high heeled shoes.
And every time I'm able
I'm under the conference table.

My daddy is president,
We make a happy pair.
I go for my pony ride,
He rides in his rocking chair.

No matter what I do
It makes a news event
'Cause my daddy is the president.
