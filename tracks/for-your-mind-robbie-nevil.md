Do you like philosophy
What are your political views
Oh, oh
I really think that I could
Learn a lot from you
Oh, oh

Never even noticed
The way you dress
That was never my main interest
I'm not after your body
Although you do look nice

I don't want your body
I only want you
I really only want you
For your mind
Oh, oh
For your mind
Oh, oh

Do you like to meditate
Do you plan a life of dreams
Oh, oh
You know all the other guys
Only want one thing

I'm not after your body
That's all good and fine

I don't want your body
I only want
I really only want you
For your mind
Oh, oh
For your mind

Even though lookin' that good
Should be a crime
I really only want you
For your mind

I'm not after your body
Although it would be nice
There's so much more to you, honey

I only want you
I really only want you
And I really only want you
For your mind
Oh, oh
For your mind
Oh, oh

Even though lookin' that good
Should be a crime
I really only want you
For your mind
Oh, oh
For your mind

Other guys want more
But that would keep me satisfied,
For your mind
For your mind, yeah, yeah

Even though lookin' that good
Should be a crime, yeah
Oh, oh
