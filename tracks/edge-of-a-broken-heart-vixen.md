I can't believe I could've been so blind, but love is strange
I thought about it for a long, long time, but the truth remains
I don't need another lonely night to dry my tears
The answer's plain as black and white, and I can see the picture very clear...

I've been livin' on the edge of a broken heart
I don't wanna fall, I don't wanna crawl
I've been livin' on the edge of a broken heart
Don't you wonder why, I gotta say goodbye!

It isn't like you never had the chance to change your tune
Did you think that I'm a dime a dance, well the dance is through
I've been doing things your way too long, well, baby that's over! (Baby that's over)
It won't be easy, but I gotta be strong, and if I wanna cry I won't need your shoulder

I've been livin' on the edge of a broken heart
I don't wanna fall, I don't wanna crawl
I've been livin' on the edge of a broken heart
Don't you wonder why, I gotta say goodbye!

I'll find someone else, who's nothing like you
And two can play the game as well
And you're gonna be sorry, baby, when it's over!

I've been doing things your way too long, baby that's over! (Baby that's over)
It won't be easy, but I got to be strong, and if I wanna cry I won't need your shoulder

I've been livin' on the edge of a broken heart
I don't wanna fall, I don't wanna crawl
I've been livin' on the edge of a broken heart
Don't you wonder why, I gotta say goodbye!
I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
Don't you wonder why, I gotta say goodbye!
I've been living on the edge of a broken heart
