Been such a long time since I saw you
Tell me, girl, how long has it been
I'm so glad to see you, 'cause I really love you
You were my only friend

You for me and me for you
Oh, listen, baby
You for me and me for you

It's been such a long time
Girl, I still love you
I guess I'll always will
But in my silent nights, I long to hold you tight
It's you I really need

You for me and me for you
Listen, baby
You for me and me for you, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ahhh.  Oh, no, no.  Ahhh

Here's what you got to do, you got to do for me
You got to understand me
I got to understand you
You got to hang on in there

You know I love you.  (It's been too long.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, oooh, oooh.)
Oh, oh.  (Hang on, hang on, hang on.)
You've got to sit down and make a little love to me, baby
(Hang on, hang on, hang on.)  Oooh, oooh, oooh
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.  (It's been too long.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, oooh, oooh.)
You got to understand me, baby, (Hang on, hang on, hang on.)
And I'll understand you.  (It's been too long.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, oooh, oooh.)
