Let's pony again
(Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it)
I'm gonna get on my pony and ride
(Ride)

Ride
(Ride)
Ride
I'm gonna get on my pony and ride
(Ride)
'Til you're by my side

Now, you can shake, shout, stop and smile
And you can run the quarter horse
Or ride
'Til you're by my side

Well, get it
(Get it, get it, get it, get it)
Pony, baby
(Get it, get it, get it, get it)
Shake it, baby

(Get it, get it, get it, get it)
Come on and pony with me
(Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it)
I'm gonna get on my pony and ride
(Ride)

Ride
(Ride)
Ride
(Ride)

I'm gonna swing me a lasso and ride
(Ride)
'Til you're roped and tied

Now, you can shake, shout, stop and smile
And you can jump, thump, all in stride
Or ride
'Til you're by my side

Well, get it
(Get it, get it, get it, get it)
Pony, baby
(Get it, get it, get it, get it)
Shake it, baby

(Get it, get it, get it, get it)
Come on and pony with me
(Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it)
Pony with me

Well, get it
(Get it, get it, get it, get it)
Pony, baby
(Get it, get it, get it, get it)
Shake it, baby

(Get it, get it, get it, get it)
Come on and pony with me
(Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it)

I'm gonna get on my pony and ride
(Ride)
Ride
(Ride)
Ride
(Ride)

I'm gonna get on my pony and ride
(Ride)
'Til you're by my side

Now, you can shake, shout, stop and smile
And you can run the quarter horse
Or ride
'Til you're by my side

Come on and get it
(Get it, get it, get it, get it)
Pony, baby
(Get it, get it, get it, get it)
Shake it, baby

(Get it, get it, get it, get it)
Come on and pony with me
(Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it)
