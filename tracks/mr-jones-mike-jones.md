You can ride all day long
Another mike diesel production (Mike Jones)
But youâll never catch Mr. Jones (Mr. Jones)
Heâs got a gang thatâs far too strong (Ice Age Ice Age Ice Age)
Your friends know it, thatâs why youâre all alone (All alone)
Chasing the man you canât see (Mike Jones)
So just walk away and let him be
Heâs got a shotgun so go back home (Who? Who?)
Cause youâll never get Mr. Jones (Mike Jones)


Iâm back my music tracks about to sell another meal
My pants they sagginâ from them hundred dollar bills
These haters hate but they donât really wanna see the steal
These haters hate but they donât really wanna see the steal
Had a million in my bank before I solemn bought the deal
Had a million in my bank before I solemn bought the deal
Before I came I just say the streets wouldnât feel
The shit that Iâm spittinâ the shit thatâs real
But now Iâm like mellow Iâm the king of the hill
American dream Iâm livinâ that for real
Eleven Corvette a nigga tell me how you feel
The diamonds on my teeth and put them on my phantom grill (Smile, ha ha)


You can ride all day long (Mike Jones)
But youâll never catch Mr. Jones (Mr. Jones)
Heâs got a gang thatâs far too strong (Ice Age Ice Age Ice Age)
Your friends know it, thatâs why youâre all alone (All alone)
Chasing the man you canât see (Mike Jones)
So just walk away and let him be
Heâs got a shotgun so go back home (Who? Who?)
Cause youâll never get Mr. Jones (Mike Jones)


I used to get dissed by the chicks in the club
Now they want to rub my belly wanna show ya boy some love
They see me iced up they be like what's up?
Try to jack me if u wanna Iâma leave u fucked up
Used to roll hatchback now Iâm Cadillac and Benz
Used to roll hatchback now Iâm Cadillac and Benz
I used to have homies now Iâm like fuck friends
Cause even back then all they did was pretend
Now I got my own label Ice Age and Iâm boss
Iâm the mayor of this town with the key to that vault
All my cars black on black except the one with big gloss
Got another white on white I call that ho rick Rick Ross (Ross) (Ha ha ha ha)


You can ride all day long (Mike Jones)
But youâll never catch Mr. Jones (Mr. Jones)
Heâs got a gang thatâs far too strong (Ice Age Ice Age Ice Age)
Your friends know it, thatâs why youâre all alone (All alone)
Chasing the man you canât see (You canât see me baby)
So just walk away and let him be
Heâs got a shotgun so go back home (Who? Who?)
Cause youâll never get Mr. Jones (Mike Jones)


Hey
Now make it rain
Hey
Now make it rain
Hey

American dream â album and movie on the way baby (ha ha ha ha ha ha)
