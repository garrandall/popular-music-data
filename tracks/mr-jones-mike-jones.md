You can ride all day long
Another Myke Diesel production (Mike Jones)
But you'll never catch Mr. Jones (Hahahahahaha)
He's got a gang that's far too strong (Ice Age, Ice Age, Ice Age)
Your friends know it, that's why you're all alone (Hahahahahaha)
Chasing a man you can't see (Mike Jones)
So just walk away and let him be
He's got a shotgun so go back home
(Who? Mike Jones Who? Mike Jones)
'Cause you'll never get Mr. Jones (Mike Jones, Mike Jones)


I'm back, my music tracks about to sell another mil'
My pants stay saggin' from them hundred dollar bills
These haters hate but they don't really wanna see the steel
These haters hate but they don't really wanna see the steel
Had a million in my bank before Asylum bought the deal
Had a million in my bank before Asylum bought the deal
Before I came I just say the streets wouldn't feel
The shit that I'm spittin', the shit that's real
But now I'm like Melo, I'm the king of the hill
American dream, I'm livin' that for real
Eleven cars later, nigga, tell me how you feel
Took the diamonds off my teeth and put 'em on my Phantom grill (Smile, ha ha)


You can ride all day long (Mike Jones, Mike Jones)

I used to get dissed by the chicks in the club
Now they want to rub my belly, wanna show your boy some love
They see me iced up, they be like, "What's up?"
Try to jack me if you wanna, I'ma leave you fucked up
Used to roll hatchback, now I'm Cadillac and Benz
Used to roll hatchback, now I'm Cadillac and Benz
I used to have homies, now I'm like, "fuck friends"
'Cause even back then all they did was pretend
Now I got my own label Ice Age and I'm boss
I'm the mayor of this town with the key to that vault
All my cars black on black except the one with thick gloss
Got another white on white I call that ho rick Rick Ross (Ross)
(Haha, haha)

Chasing a man you can't see (You can't see me, baby)
So just walk away, and let him be
He's got a shotgun so go back home
