Mmm yeaahh yeaeaa yeaaa 

I was born off an old dirt road 40 acre farm no highway no interstate 
& I drive an old rusted out Chevrolet, the boys all rubber neck while their out makin' hay. 

Hey, I'm a wildflower, growin' in the sunshine, soakin' up the way of life I was raised in,
runnin' barefoot bloomin' in a summer shower, ponytail dancin' I can't help it. I-I'm a wildflower. 

Oooo yeahh oooo yeahhh 

Theres a little cotton dress hangin' in my sisters closet,
I think I'm gonna borrow it, and wear it this weekend.
Painted my toes, bought some cherry lip gloss.
No rose, No daisy, can touch what I got 

Yeaah 

I'm a wildflower, growin in the sunshine, soakin' up the way of life I was raised in,
runnin' barefoot bloomin' in a summer shower, ponytail dancin' I cant help it. I-I'm a wildflower. 

Oooo yeaah oooo yeahh 

I'm just a girl that needs a little sun, a little rain, an open field to play 

Hey, I'm a wildflower, growin' in the sunshine soakin' up the way of life I was raised in,
runnin' barefoot bloomin' in a summer shower, ponytail dancin' I can't help it. I-I'm a wildflower. 

I'm a wildflower, growin' in the sunshine soakin' up the way of life I was raised in,
runnin' barefoot bloomin' in a summer shower, ponytail dancin' I can't help it. I-I'm a wildflower. 

Oooo yeah oooo yeahh I-I'm a wildflower 

Oooo yeah oooo yeah I'm a wildflower 

Yeaahh yeaeaa yeaaa I'm a wildflower
