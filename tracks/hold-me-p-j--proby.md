When you're near me I feel romantic
When you go, go far away
If you want me to remain romantic
Here are all the things you'll have to say

Hold me, honey won't you hold me, yeah
Hold me, never let me go
Take me, honey won't you take me
Never to forsake me, 'cause I love you so

Thrill me, let your kisses thrill me, yeah
Oh, just like you alone can do
Oh, hold me, tenderly enfold me
Never try to hold me away from you

Oh, thrill me, baby let your kisses thrill me, yeah
Just like you alone can do
Oh, hold me, tenderly enfold me, oh yeah
Never try to hold me away from you
Never try to hold me away from you
Baby listen to me
Don't you try to hold me away from you
