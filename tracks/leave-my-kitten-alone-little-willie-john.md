You better leave (meow) my kitten alone (meow, meow)
You better leave (meow, meow) my kitten alone (meow, meow)
I done told you big bad bulldog
You better leave her alone (meow, meow)

Don't you know my kitten is a dream?
Don't you know my kitten is a dream?
So, get your hands off of her, 'cause I'm her lovin' man

*Mr. Dog I'm gonna hit you on the top a yo' head
The Batgirl's gonna miss you
And you'll wish that you were dead

If you don't lee-ee-eave my kitten alone
Yes, I love my little kitten
Like you hounddogs love your bone

(Instrumental & sax)

Mr. Dog, I'm gonna hit you on the top a yo' head
The *Batgirl's gonna miss you
And you'll wish that you were dead

If you don't lee-ee-eave my kitten alone
Yes, I love my little kitten
Like all you hounddogs love your bone

Oh yeah
You better leave
You better leave
FADES-
You better lee-ee-ee-eave.

Note:
* Mr. Dog ('The Bathound) and *Batgirl, might refer to the comic characters from the 50's in Batman and Detective Comic Books.
(Not sure, just guessing!)
