Please please tell me now, please please tell me now
Please please tell me now, please please tell me now

I made a break I run out yesterday tried to find my mountain hideaway
Maybe next year maybe no go
I know you're watching me every minute of the day yeah
I've seen the signs and the looks and the pictures that give your game away yeah
There's a dream that strings the road a broken glass for us to hold
And I cut so far before I had to say

Please please tell me now is there something I should know
Is there something I should say that'll make you come my way
Do you feel the same cause you don't let it show

Oh oh, oh, oh people stare and cross the road from me
oh oh, And jungle drums they all clear the way for me
Can you read my mind can you see in the snow
And firey deamons all dance when you walk through that door
Don't say you're easy on me you're about as easy as a nuclear war
There's a dream that strings the road with broken glass for us to hold
And I cut so far before I had to say

Please please tell me now is there something I should know
Is there something I should say that'll make you come my way
Do you feel the same cause you don't let it show

Please please tell me now is there (please please tell me now)something I should know
Is there (please please tell me now) something I should say
That'll (please please tell me now) make you come my way
Please please tell me now can you see (please please tell me now) what makes me blow
Can you (please please tell me now) see how much I'd die
Everytime (please please tell me now) it passes by
Please please tell me now what it (please please tell me now) takes to make it show
Is there (please please tell me now) something I should know
Is there (please please tell me now) something I should know
