When I was just a wee little lad full of health and joy.
My father homeward came one night and gave to me a toy.
A wonder to behold it was with many colors bright.
And the moment I laid eyes on it it became my heart's delight.
It went "ZIP" when it moved and "BOP" when
It stopped and "WHIRR" when it stood still.
I never knew just what it was and I guess I never will.

From the moment that I picked it up, I had a big surprise.
For right on its bottom were two big
Buttons that looked like big green eyes.
I first pushed one and then the other and then I twisted its lid.
When I set it down again, this is what it did.
It went "ZIP" when it moved and "BOP" when
It stopped and "WHIRR" when it stood still.
I never knew just what it was and I guess I never will.

It first marched left,
Then marched right, and then marched under a chair.
And when I looked where it had gone, it wasn't even there.
I started to sob but my father
Laughed for he'd know that I would find.
When I turned around, my marvelous toy was chugging from behind.
It went "ZIP" when it moved and "BOP" when
It stopped and "WHIRR" when it stood still.
I never knew just what it was and I guess I never will.

The years have passed by quickly it seemed and I have my own wee boy.
Yesterday I gave to him my marvelous little toy.
His eyes nearly popped right out of
His head and he gave a squeal of glee.
Neither one of us knows just what it is but he loves it just like me.
It goes "ZIP" when it moves and "BOP" when
It stops and "WHIRR" when it stands still.
Neither one of us knows just what it is and I guess we never will.
It goes "ZIP" when it moves and "BOP" when
It stops and "WHIRR" when it stands still.
Neither one of us knows just what it is and I guess we never will.
