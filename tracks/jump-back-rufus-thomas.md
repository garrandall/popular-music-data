Mary Mack, dressed in black
Silver buttons up and down her back
How'd I know? Yes, she told
She broke her needle, now she can't sew

Walkin' the dog
I'm just a-walkin' your dog
Well, if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog

Ask your mama for fifteen cents
To see the elephant jump the fence
It jumped so high, it touched the sky
Didn't come back 'til the fourth of July

I'm walkin' the dog
I'm just a-walkin' your dog
Well, if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog

Mary Mary, quite contrary
How does your garden grow?
Well well, silver bells and little bitty bitty white shells
Pretty maids all in a row

Walkin' your dog
I'm just a-walkin' your dog
Well, if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog, yeah
Well, if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
Well, if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
