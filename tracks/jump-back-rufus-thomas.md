Last night, night before
(Jump back, baby, jump back)
24 robbers at my door
(Jump back, baby, jump back)

I got up and let 'em in
(Jump back, baby, jump back)
Hit 'em in da head with a rolling pin
(Jump back, baby, jump back)

When I got 'em in a Billy goat town
(Jump back, baby, jump back)
Billy goat kicked his pappy down
(Jump back, baby, jump back)

Oh, jump back, baby, jump back
Oh, jump back, baby, jump back
Oh, jump, jump

Now, I lay me down to sleep
(Jump back, baby, jump back)
Givin' the bedbugs a chance to creep
(Jump back, baby, jump back)

If one should bite before I wake
(Jump back, baby, jump back)
Hope the world his jaw will break
(Jump back, baby, jump back)

Oh, jump back, baby, jump back
Oh, jump back, baby, jump back
Oh, jump, jump

Went to the river, I couldn't get across
Paid five dollars for an old gray horse
Horse wouldn't pull, I swapped him for a bull
Bull wouldn't holla, I sold him for a dollar

Dollar wouldn't pass, I throwed it in the grass
Grass wouldn't grow, I chopped it with a hoe
Hoe wouldn't chop, I took it to the shop
Shop made money like a bee makes honey

Oh, jump back baby, jump back
Oh, jump back baby, jump back
Oh, jump

Wait a minute, baby
(Jump)
Ooh, come on do it
(Jump)

Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Jump)
Ooh, yeah, yeah
(Oh, jump back)

Oh, wait a minute, baby
(Oh, jump back)
Oh, come on, baby
(Oh, jump back)

Oh, come on, baby
(Oh, jump back)
Oh, wait a minute, baby
(Oh, jump back)

Jump back, jump back, baby
(Oh, jump back)
Jump back, jump back, baby
(Oh, jump back)

Jump back, jump back, baby
(Oh, jump back)
Jump back, jump back, baby
(Oh, jump back)

Oh, come on, baby
(Oh, jump back)
Oh, come on, baby
(Oh, jump back)

Oh, wait a minute, baby
(Oh, jump back)
Oh, wait a minute, baby
(Oh, jump back)

Oh, come on, baby
(Oh, jump back)
Oh, come on, baby
(Oh, jump back)
