Kurt
Made a wrong turn once or twice
Dug my way out, blood and fire
Bad decisions, that's alright
Welcome to my silly life

Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood
Miss "No way it's all good"
It didn't slow me down
Mistaken, always second guessin'
Underestimated
Look, I'm still around

Blaine & Kurt
Pretty pretty please, don't you ever ever feel
Like you're less than, less than perfect
Pretty pretty please, if you ever ever feel like you're nothing
You are perfect to me

You're so mean when you talk about yourself
You were wrong
Change the voices in your head
Make them like you instead

So complicated, look how big you'll make it
Filled with so much hatred
Such a tired game
It's enough, I've done all I can think of
Chased down all my demons
See you do the same

Oh, pretty pretty please, don't you ever ever feel
Like you're less than, less than perfect
Pretty pretty please, if you ever ever feel like you're nothing
You are perfect

The whole world's scared, so I swallow the fear
The only thing I should be drinking is an ice cold beer
So cool in line, and we try try try
But we try too hard, and it's a waste of my time
Done looking for the critics, 'cause they're everywhere
They don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair
Strange ourselves, and we do it all the time
Why do we do that?
Why do I do that?
Why do I do that?
Yeah, oh...

Oh pretty, pretty please
Pretty pretty please, don't you ever ever feel
Like you're less than, less than perfect
Pretty pretty please, if you ever ever feel like you're nothing
You are perfect to me

Pretty pretty please, don't you ever ever feel
Like you're less than, less than perfect
You're perfect
You're perfect to me
Pretty pretty please, don't you ever ever feel like you're nothing
You are perfect to me
