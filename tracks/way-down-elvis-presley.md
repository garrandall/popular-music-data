Babe, you're getting closer
The lights are goin' dim
The sound of your breathin'
Has made the mood I'm in

All of my resistance
Is lying on the floor
Taking me to places
I've never been before

Oh, and I can feel it
Feel it, feel it, feel it

Way down where the music plays
(Way down) Way down like a tidal wave
(Way down) Way down where the fires blaze
Way down, down, way, way on down

Oh, my head is spinnin'
You got me in your spell,
A hundred magic fingers
On a whirling carousel

The medicine within me
No doctor could prescribe
Your love is doing something
That I just can't describe

Oh, and I can feel it
Feel it, feel it, feel it

Way down where the music plays
(Way down) Way down like a tidal wave
(Way down) Way down where the fires blaze
Way down, down, way, way on down

Hold me again as tight as you can
I need you so, baby, let's go

(Way down) Way down where it feels so good
(Way down) Way down where I hoped it would
(Way down) Way down where I never could
Way down, down, way, way on down
