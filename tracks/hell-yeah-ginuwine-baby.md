Uh, Wooo, oo ooooo, oo ooooo, oo ooooo, oo ooooo


Have you ever seen the thug in the club with a bottle turned up
Head bobbinâ like hell, yeah
Have you ever seen the chick in the club with a drink in the cup
Booty shakinâ like hell, yeah
Have you seen those Big Tymers pull up in the front of the club
24s like hell, yeah
Have you ever seen 50 thousand strong with their hands in the air
Up and down like hell, yeah


So fresh, so fly, so sweet, so polite
So much, too many, but we ridinâ tonight
Well, itâs that pimp talk that ainât that pimp walk
Itâs big pimpinâ over here, player, that just started

See, we fresh with Air Ones, Lexus and big drums


Chips, Willie Chicks, Willie crisp, big fun


Ma, you worry none, the minks come with the guns
Prada, the Gucci, itâs all in Bird fun


Iâm sittinâ in my truck, snakinâ the club out
Kill this sip then go wild the fuck out
Up in the club with my hands in the air
Thereâs so much coochie in the atmosphere
So girl, quit frontinâ and get youâre ass over here
And get yourself a cup of this Cran and Belvedere
Iâm all off in the corner 100 honeys takinâ pics
Baby in the VIP with lots of chicks
Iâm pimped out now, low cut, and a pick
G and Big Tymers together, thatâs what Iâm talkinâ


Have you ever seen the thug in the club with a bottle turned up
Head bobbinâ like hell, yeah
Have you ever seen the chick in the club with a drink in the cup
Booty shakinâ like hell, yeah
Have you seen those Big Tymers pull up in the front of the club
24s like hell, yeah
Have you ever seen 50 thousand strong with their hands in the air
Up and down like hell, yeah


So fresh, so clean, so shiny, on a beam
Girl, youâre so mean, why youâre doinâ a damn thing
Any more room for me in those jeans
Uh-huh, uh-huh
We got so many rooms in the Swiss like we were Swiss sailors
Mami, givinâ me head like sheâs a brain doner
A pool party in my crib at the Daytona
Hosted by Sonia and Monya, ooh


Mami, walkinâ up the beach, so fly, so neat
Itâs me and Ginuwine, 23s on our feet
Say mami, you look good, mami, youâre so fly
You need a D-Boy, come over here and get superfly


Have you ever seen the thug in the club with a bottle turned up
Head bobbinâ like hell, yeah
Have you ever seen the chick in the club with a drink in the cup
Booty shakinâ like hell, yeah
Have you seen those Big Tymers pull up in the front of the club
24s like hell, yeah
Have you ever seen 50 thousand strong with their hands in the air
Up and down like hell, yeah


Said we love them cars and we love them chicks
And we love them parties and we love that Crisâ
And we love them houses and we love that ice
And when we rollinâ through your hood we love to shoot that dice


Have you ever seen the thug in the club with a bottle turned up
Head bobbinâ like hell, yeah
Have you ever seen the chick in the club with a drink in the cup
Booty shakinâ like hell, yeah

Have you seen those Big Tymers pull up in the front of the club
24s like hell, yeah
Have you ever seen 50 thousand strong with their hands in the air
Up and down like hell, yeah
