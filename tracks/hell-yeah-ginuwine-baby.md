(Intro)
Woo, we gon' do it like MJ used to do it
You know what I'm sayin', I'm like that kind
Woo, Woo, Woo
Check me out!

(Chorus)
Have you ever seen the thug in the club with a bottle turned up
Head bobbin' like HELL YEAH!
Have you ever seen the chick in the club with a drinkin the cup
Booty shakin' like HELL YEAH!
Have you seen those Big Tymers pull up in the front of the club
24's like HELL YEAH!
Have you ever seen 50 thousand strong with their hands in the air
Up and down like HELL YEAH!

(Baby)
So fresh, so fly, so sweet, so polite
So much, too many, but we ridin' tonight
Well, it's that pimp talk that ain't that pimp walk
It's big pimpin' over here, player, that just started
See, we fresh with Air Ones, Lexus and big drums
(Chips, Plenty Chicks, Plenty crisp, big fun)
Ma, you worry none, the minks come with the guns
Prada, the Gucci, it's all in Bird fun

(Ginuwine)
I'm sittin' in my truck, snakin' the club out
Kill this sip then go wild the f*** out
Up in the club with my hands in the air
There's so much coochie in the atmosphere
So girl, quit frontin' and get you're a** over here
And get yourself a cup of this Crown and Belvedere
I'm all off in the corner with honeys takin' pics
They be in the VIP with lots of chicks
I'm pimped out now, low cut, and a pick
G and Big Tymers together, that's a hit

(Chorus)
(Ginuwine)
So fresh, so clean, so shiny, on a beam
Girl, you're so mean, why you're doin' a damn thing
Any more room for me in those jeans
Uh-huh, uh-huh
We got so many rooms in the Swiss like we were Swiss sailors
Mami, givin' me head like she's a brain doner
A pool party in my crib up in Daytona
Hosted by Sonia and Monya, ooh

(Baby)
Mami, walkin' up the beach, so fly, so neat
It's me and Ginuwine, 23's on our feet
Say mami, you look good, mami, you're so fly
You need a D-Boy, come over here and get superfly

(Chorus)
(Ginuwine)
Said we love them cars and we love them chicks
And we love them parties and we love that Cris'
And we love them houses and we love that ice
And when we rollin' through your hood we love to shoot that dice

(Chorus 3X)
