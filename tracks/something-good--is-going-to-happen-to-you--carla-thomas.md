Yes, it is, honey
Something good's gonna happen to you
Well, all right now

I lost all faith in man
But you took by my hand
Said that I looked just for you
We're gonna prove that
You're really true now

Something (something)
Good's gonna happen to you
Yes, it is now
Something (something)
Good's gonna happen to you
Well, all right

I didn't give in fast
That kind of love never lasts
Then at night, you had no rest
Makes me know that you
Passed the test now

Something (something)
Oh, good's gonna happen to you

Oh, oh, oh, yeah
I'm gonna love you right
Morning, noon and night
Love you when you call
'Cause you deserve it all

Oh, that's why
Something (something)
Oh, good's gonna happen to you
Yes, it is
Something (something)
Good's gonna happen to you
I'm gonna make it

Oh, oh, oh, yeah, oh
Something good's gonna happen to you
Something good's gonna happen to you

I'm gonna make it happen
I got to make it happen
So sweet, you're so nice
So good, that's why
