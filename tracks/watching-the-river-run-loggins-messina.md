If you've been thinking you're all that you've got
Then don't feel alone anymore
When we're together, then you've got alot
'Cause I am the river and you are the shore

And it goes on and on, oh, watching the river run
Further and further from things that we've done
Leaving them one by one
And we have just begun watching the river run
Listening and learning and yearning
Run, river, run

Winding and swirling and dancing along
We pass by the old willow tree
Where lovers caress as we sing of our song
Twisting together when we greet the sea

And it goes on and on, watching the river run
Further and further from things that we've done
Leaving them one by one
And we have just begun watching the river run
Listening and learning and yearning
Run, river, run

And it goes on and on, watching the river run
Further and further from things that we've done
Leaving them one by one
And we have just begun watching the river run
Listening and learning and yearning
Run, river, run
