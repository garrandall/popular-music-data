Money over everythang (Yeaaah-ee)
Self made, but right now shawty (Ey-ey-ey-ey-ei-ee)
You lookin like money (yea!)
I'm talkin 'bout real money, huh!
(Yeah-EAH!)


My bitch bad, lookin like a bag of money (Ohh-oh-ooh-woooo-ooh-ooooooooh)
That bitch bad, lookin like a bag of money (Yea-ea-ea-ey-ei-ee)
I go and get it and I let her count it for me (Hey-ey-eh-ey-ei-ee)
I fuck her good and she always ride it for me (Ooooh, she bad)
My bitch bad, lookin like a bag of money (She bad bad bad, she bad bad bad)
That bitch bad, lookin like a bag of money (She bad bad bad, she bad ohh-oh-ooh-wooo-ooh)
I go and get it and I let her count it for me (Ohh-oh-ooh-woooo-ooh)
I fuck her good and she always ride it for me (Oooh, she ride it for me)


She got me caught up in the moment (She got me caught up in the mo-MENT!)
She got me cuaght up in the moment (She got me caught up in the moment)
I only kiss her when she on it (Ooh, when she on it)
Fuck her good, make her call me in the morning (Oooh, ooh, whoo)




Temporary forever (word), levitate witta nigga (word)
I could tease you 'til you hate me, bet you hate them naval kisses (nah)
We can do like eight positions (uh), hit it til yo' make-up missin (uh-huh)
Baby girl my stroke official, and you know I paint that picture
Hoes on my line (Word up!), most of 'em 9s (Word up!)
Couple of 'em dimes, but all my hoes is hard to find
And I ain't always on the prowl, it's just my soda mixed with brown
Got me quite open for a while, so let me in or let me out
And I like my marijuana bright, and I like my window tinted out
Shout out them strippers who hustle - get yours, you know what this about
I just might throw a big amount, don't know if I'm 'posed to take you out
I just know I'm 'posed to praise you up, don't mean I ain't 'posed to take you down
Word up!




My bitch bad lookin like a bag of money
E'ry time she fuck me she say "Can I have some money?"
And I say, "Can I get a threesome?â, she say "Boy, you funny"
But I be like, "F'real, just pick up that phone, call up one of your girls"
When I'm on that pill and I pop dat purr -- girl, I put in that work
Long as she come to me first, it's fourteen racks what I put on that purse
Shit that Birkin bag, make the old dude mad, when I murk through pass in a dark blue Jag
Say she like my style, but I talk too fast, and I got that drive, and she just might crash
Hold up! She say she fuckin with me the long way (long way)
She gon' ride this dick, I had a long day (long day)
Nigga look at my bitch, you lookin the wrong way
Somethin mean, look exactly just like the song say
