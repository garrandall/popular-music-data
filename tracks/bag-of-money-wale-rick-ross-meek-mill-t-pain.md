My chick bad, looking like a bag of money
That chick bad, looking like a bag of money
I go and get it and I let her count it for me
I treat her good and she always ride it for me

My chick bad, looking like a bag of money
That chick bad, looking like a bag of money
I go and get it and I let her count it for me
I treat her good and she always ride it for me

She got me caught up in the moment
She got me caught up in the moment
I only kiss her when she on it
Treat her good, make her call me in the morning

My chick bad, looking like a bag of money
That chick bad, looking like a bag of money
I go and get it and I let her count it for me
I treat her good and she always ride it for me

My chick bad, looking like a bag of money
That chick bad, looking like a bag of money
I go and get it and I let her count it for me
I treat her good and she always ride it for me

Temporary forever, levitate with a nigga
I can teach you, till you hate me but you hate them naval kisses
We can do like 8 positions
Hit it til your make up missing
Baby girl my stroke official
And you know I paint that picture
Hoes on my line, most of 'em 9's
Couple of 'em dimes but all my hoes is hard to find
And I ain't always on the prowl its just my soda mixed with brown
Got me quite open for a while
So let me in or let me out
And I like my marijuana bright
And I like my window tinted out
Shout out them strippers who hustle
Yeah George you know what this about
I just might throw a big amount
Don't know if I'm 'posed to take you out
I just know I'm 'posed to praise you up
Don't mean I ain't 'posed to take you down
Word up

My chick bad, looking like a bag of money
That chick bad, looking like a bag of money
I go and get it and I let her count it for me
I treat her good and she always ride it for me

My chick bad, looking like a bag of money
That chick bad, looking like a bag of money
I go and get it and I let her count it for me
I treat her good and she always ride it for me

My chick bad looking like a bag of money
E'rry time she f*** me she say "can I have some money?"
And I say "can I get a threesome?"
She say "boy, you funny"
But I be like foreal, just pick up that phone
Call on one of your girls
When I'm on that pill and I pop that perc
Girl I put in that work
Long as she come to me first
Its 14 racks what I put on that purse
Shit that Birkin bag, make the old dude mad
When I murk through passed in a dark blue jag
Say she like my style but I talk too fast
And I got that drive and she just might crash
Hold up

She say she fucking with me the long way
She gon' ride this dick I had a long day
N**** look at my chick you looking the wrong way
Something mean, look exactly just like the song say

My chick bad, looking like a bag of money
That chick bad, looking like a bag of money
I go and get it and I let her count it for me
I treat her good and she always ride it for me

My chick bad, looking like a bag of money
That chick bad, looking like a bag of money
I go and get it and I let her count it for me
I treat her good and she always ride it for me

She got me caught up in the moment
She got me caught up in the moment
I only kiss her when she on it
Treat her good, make her call me in the morning
