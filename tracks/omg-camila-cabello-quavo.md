Baby, what'cha say?
I ain't here to, I ain't here to conversate
Baby, I don't play
From Miami, causin' trouble in LA
Rowdy, Tennessee
If I don't send for you, best not come for me
Jordan, 23
Guarantee you're gonna wanna leave with me

I got that la la la like
Pull up, pull up, pull up straight from Tokyo
You cannot believe it when we come through
Woo, my God, you look good today
Woo, my God, you look good today
Back up, back up, back up, do it slow-mo
When she drop, it bounce back like a yo-yo
Woo, my God, you look good today
You look good today, yeah
Oh my God


Oh my God, yeah
Oh my God, you're awesome (oh my God)
Oh my God, yeah
Oh my God, you're awesome (oh my God)
Oh my God, yeah
Oh my God, you're awesome (oh my God)
Oh my God, yeah


Ice cold, like my drink
Lose your concentration when you take a sip, yeah
Cyclone, make it spin
Cause all I, all I, all I, all I do is win
Yeah I'm cut like a diamond, I'm cold
4 am, bloom like a rose
Girls like the summer, we're cold, oh

We got that la la la like
Pull up, pull up, pull up straight from Tokyo
You cannot believe it when we come through
Woo, my God, you look good today
Woo, my God, you look good today
Back up, back up, back up, do it slow-mo
When she drop, it bounce back like a yo-yo
Woo, my God, you look good today
You look good today, yeah
Oh my God


Oh my God, yeah
Oh my God, you're awesome (oh my God)
Oh my God, yeah
Oh my God, you're awesome (oh my God)
Oh my God, yeah
Oh my God, you're awesome (oh my God)
Oh my God, yeah


Oh my God, she's so right, though
Me and you, that's a iso
Waist so small, look like lipo
Moonwalk, my diamonds Michael
She so fine, I call my best man
Ain't no rings on her left hand (no rings)
I had a dream I was in quicksand (dream)
Then I woke up with the best plans (oh my God, yeah)
Oh my God, you're awesome
Smoke more green than Boston (green)
I make a play and call them
Oh my God, she flossing (woo)
On the cover of magazines, I'ma crown the queen (queen)
Bad and boujee, thick and pretty
I'm givin' her wet dreams
I'm the main reason why her friends like me
Having her mad at me, tackle me like I'm an athlete


Pull up, pull up, pull up straight from Tokyo
You cannot believe it when we come through
Woo, my God, you look good today
Woo, my God, you look good today
Back up, back up, back up, do it slow-mo
When she drop, it bounce back like a yo-yo
Woo, my God, you look good today
You look good today, yeah
Oh my God
