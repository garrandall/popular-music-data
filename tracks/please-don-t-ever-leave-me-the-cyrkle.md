Please don't ever leave me
Please don't ever go
Won't you stay please don't take away
The only happiness I know

If you ever leave me
If you ever go (away)
On your way don't forget the day
You lost the only love you'll ever know

Girl won't you try to believe me
Girl don't you know love is blind
Now that you're trying to leave me
Slowly but surely I'm going clear out of my mind, yeah

Please don't ever leave me (please don't leave)
Please don't ever go (please don't ever go)

Won't you stay, please don't take away
The only happiness I know (happiness I know)

If you ever leave me
If you ever go (away)
On your way don't forget the day
You lost the only love you'll ever know

La, la la la la la
La, la la la la
La la la
La la la la la
La la la la la

La la la la la la
La la la
