Down by the levee where the riverboats go
Lived a Louisiana farmer by the name of Papa Dabro
Papa had a daughter with a beautiful smile
Everybody called her Sweet Chile

Sweet Chile (livin' on the bayou) Sweet Chile (livin' on the bayou)
Sweet Chile's goin' on seventeen
Sweet Chile's gonna be a teenage queen
Sweet Chile livin' on the bayou Sweet Chile livin' on the bayou
She's much sweeter than sugar cane
Sweet Chile's puttin' on curves and things

Papa took Sweet Chile into town
Buy her a graduation gown
Papa said mama would you look at this
The way that Sweet Chile fills that dress

(Sweet Chile) livin' on the bayou (Sweet Chile) livin' on the bayou
(Sweet Chile's goin' on seventeen
Sweet Chile's gonna be a teenage queen)
(Sweet Chile) livin' on the bayou (Sweet Chile) livin' on the bayou
(She's much sweeter than sherry pie)
Sweet Chile's gettin' to be courtin' size

Down by the river where the sugar cane grows
Sweet Chile wears a brand new clothes
She's got curves that just won't stop
She's big at the little and bottom at the top

Sweet Chile livin' on the bayou Sweet Chile livin' on the bayou
(Sweet Chile's goin' on seventeen)
Sweet Chile's gonna be a teenage queen
Sweet Chile livin' on the bayou Sweet Chile livin' on the bayou
(She's much sweeter than sugar cane)
Sweet Chile's puttin' on curves and things

Down by the levee where the riverboats go
Kids all dance to rock'n roll
Sweet Chile's rockin' till the break of day
I never saw anybody wiggle that way

(Sweet Chile) livin' on the bayou (Sweet Chile) livin' on the bayou
(Sweet Chile's goin' on seventeen
Sweet Chile's gonna be a teenage queen)
(Sweet Chile) livin' on the bayou (Sweet Chile) livin' on the bayou
(She's much sweeter than sherry pie)
Sweet Chile's gettin' to be courtin' size

Sweet Chile's puttin' on curves and things
Big at the little and bottom at the top
Squeeze squeeze Chile
