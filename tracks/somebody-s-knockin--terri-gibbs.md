Somebody's knockin'
Should I let him in
Lord, it's the devil
Would you look at him
I've heard about him
But I never dreamed
He'd have blue eyes and blue jeans

Well somebody's talkin'
He's whispering to me
Your place or my place
Well, which will it be
I'm gettin' weaker
And he's comin' on strong
But I don't wanna go wrong

He must have tapped my telephone line
He must have known
I'm spendin' my time
Alone
He says we'll have one heavenly night
My fever's burnin'
So he ought be right at home

Somebody's knockin'
Should I let him in
Lord, it's the devil
Would you look at him
I've heard about him
But I never dreamed
He'd have blue eyes and blue jeans

He must have tapped my telephone line
He must have known
I'm spendin' my time
Alone
He says we'll have one heavenly night
My fever's burnin'
So he ought be right at home

Somebody's knockin'
(Somebody's knockin')
Oh, somebody's knockin'
