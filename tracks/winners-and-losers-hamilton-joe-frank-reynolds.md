Once you've felt the feelings full
Of life and love, the ocean`s flow
Don`t let life go by

To feel the thrill of love inside
Share the thoughts
That you can't hide
Don`t let lovers die

They say winners and losers are
Two of a kind, you know it`s that way
They say winners and losers are
Two of a kind, you know it`s that way

So every day, you say again
Love's a risk, don`t hurt your friend
And don`t let love go by

You fill the cup of life so well
Let's drink to life, together
Tell the reasons why

They say winners and losers are
Two of a kind, you know it`s that way
They say winners and losers are
Two of a kind, you know it`s that way

When you`re feeling down and low
You've hurt the one who loves you so
Please, don`t you cry

Just come to me
And I`ll hold you tight
My wanting love will make it right
And love won`t go by

They say winners and losers are
Two of a kind, you know it`s that way
They say winners and losers are
Two of a kind, you know it`s that way

Winners and losers
Winners and losers

Winners and losers
Winners and losers
