Partially functional, half of me is comfortable
The other half is close to the cliff like Mrs. Huxtable
These boys got them hoslters and clips they pack like Lunchables
Like white boys in grade school, while we ate school made food
Just eyeing they shit, wish I was trying they shit
Knowing when mama hit the store she wasn’t buying that shit
No I ain't crying a bit man, that's just life that's how that shit work
You reach your hand in fire, you pull it back when you get burnt
Gotta learn when you get hurt, even if it's with cupid
He beat you and you went back, who's officially stupid?
Oh yeah I understand that's your man, you had a plan
You been together for some years, you sticking with him for the kids
So you overlook the tears, but we both know that's a bad look
'Cause 20 years from now your daughter probably get her ass whooped
Look, if this too deep for the intro I’ll find another use
But just in case its perfect let me introduce
Cole


Time to save the world, bearing the world is all the time
So many things I still don't know, so many times I've changed my mind
Guess I was born to make mistakes, but I ain't scared to take the weight
So when I stumble off the path, I know my heart will guide me back


Yea, man, is this too deep for the intro? If so I’ll find another use
But just in case its perfect, let me introduce
It’s Cole, I had a dream and so I made a move
A ill ass nigga who just so happened to stay in school
Still rap for hustlers and mothafuckers that hated school
Said "that's for busters," then heard my shit and I made it cool
It's safe to say that I’m gifted as if I’m Christmas shopping
I got gangsta niggas lining up in admissions office
Ayy, possibly cause all the hoes a nigga scraped
A lot of shit up on my plate so you know a nigga late to my first class
I’d much rather sit up in first class
Should I admit that a slutty bitch was my first smash?
Wasn't experienced, so nah I didn't wear it out
Always thought my first time would be someone I cared about
But being a virgin was something to be embarrassed 'bout
I used that ass for practice, so I wasn't scared out my mind
You call it rhymes I call it clearing out my mind
Was just a young boy starin' out my blinds
Till I got free from my mama leash
Running loose through the streets
Like a stray dog in heat
And we looking for some freaks can you play, pardon me
Whats your name, don’t mistake me for no lame, no not me
She knew I was on the team cause she seen how tall I be
In the club dappin’ niggas, even-tu-ally R-I-P
Damn, you win some, you lose some, that just how its happens
And if a nigga step up to ya, then you gotta scrap em
Your name is all you got, throwing hands by the bathroom
Its funny I barely told nobody I started rapping
'Cause see some niggas was haters that I just viewed as clowns
At 14 I knew I was the nicest dude around
I gotta make a move, I gotta do this now
If they don’t know your dreams, then they can't shoot em down


Ha, yeah nigga
Hell yeah, I felt that one in my fuckin' soul


Ooh, hey, I'm trying to decide
Which way to go, think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere
Ooh, hey, I'm trying to decide
Which way to go, think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere
