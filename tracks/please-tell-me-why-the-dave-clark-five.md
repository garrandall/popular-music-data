I don't know why she won't love me
Lord, please tell me why
Maybe it's that she don't love me
Don't count on it please, she's shy

If she's shy then I'll understand
I'll make the first move and hold her hand
But if I'm wrong then I'll be mad

I've been tryin' oh so hard
But she don't seem to notice
I sit next to her in class
But she can't see my motive

Do you think she has a boy
If she has then I'm done
'Cause if he catches me with her
I think I'll have to run

If she's passive she'll understand
I'll value my love but not in her hands
But if I'm wrong then I'll be mad
