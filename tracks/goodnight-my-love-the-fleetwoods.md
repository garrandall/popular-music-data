Well it's time to say goodnight
And finally turn out the light
How do I say in some simple way
How much you have been on my mind

But I have to let you go
It's time to move on, don't you know
But you can rely on a love that won't die
For haven't I told you so

So let's stop before it's too late
And leave it all up to the fates
Cause in spite of the heartaches
And troubles in love
I'd do it all over
Do it all over again

Each of us and everyone
Carries a burden of love
But as far as I go in my heart I know
It's you I'll be thinking of

So what is there left to say
As I see us drifting away
You can always depend on a love that won't end
Won't you think of me, think of me that way

So let's stop before it's too late
And leave it all up to the fates
Cause in spite of the heartaches
And troubles in love
I'd do it all over again

Well it's it's time to move on to the rain
And finally break the chain
In spite of the heartaches
And troubles in love
I'd do it all over (do it all over)
Do it all over again
Stop before it's too late

Cause in spite of the heartaches
And troubles in love
I'd do it all over (do it all over)
I'd do it all over again
