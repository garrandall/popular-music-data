Long-leg Sally's got a million moves
She broke their hearts, what could they do?
All the guys watch her, some even drool
She winks, they spend, she's cool!

Junkyard Johnny took the long-term snooze
We checked the bag, it wasn't booze
Back down the alley where they play the blues
He left, that night, we lose

Always get the urge to go, meet the guys
And see the show, when the sun goes down
Seems we never get let down
Nothing slow about this old town
Everybody knows

Street action - born in the night
Street action - crowds and the lights
Street action - born in the night
Street action - ready to fight
Stand on the corner we'll take in the sights
It's alright

Stovebolt Sammy got the tree timed right
He'd bust right out - hey, what a sight!
Sammy missed the Lincoln, man, it ran through the light
Sammy's in traction tonight

Always get the urge to go, meet the guys
And see the show, when the sun goes down
Seems we never get let down
Nothing slow about this old town
Everybody knows

Street action - born in the night
Street action - crowds and the lights
Street action - born in the night
Street action - ready to fight
Stand on the corner we'll take in the sights
It's alright

Street action - born in the night
Street action - crowds and the lights
Street action - born in the night
Street action - ready to fight
Street action - born in the night
Street action - crowds and the lights
Street action - born in the night
Street action - ready to fight
