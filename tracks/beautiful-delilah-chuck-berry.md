Beautiful Delilah
Sweet as apple pie
Always gets a second look
From fellows passing by
Everytime you see her
She's with a different guy
Beautiful Delilah
That's the reason why
We're begging you allow me
Fool around with you
You are so tantilizing
You just can't be true

Beautiful Delilah
Dressed in the latest style
Swinging like a pendulum
Walking down the aisle
Sees so may guys
Speaks so low and mild
Maybe she will settle down
And marry after a while
We're begging you allow me
Fool around with you
You are so tantilizing
You just can't be true

Beautiful Delilah
Bathing in the sun
Audience of seventeen
And know the mile in one
Local Casanova
Who would not be outdone
Let her steal his heart away
And break it just for fun
We're begging you allow me
Fool around with you
You are so tantilizing
You just can't be true

Beautiful Delilah
Beautiful Delilah
Beautiful Delilah
Beautiful Delilah
Beautiful Delilah
Beautiful Delilah
Beautiful Delilah
Beautiful Delilah
