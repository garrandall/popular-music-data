Stand up in a clear blue morning
Until you see, what can be
Alone in a cold day dawning
Are you still free, can you be

When some cold tomorrow finds you
When some sad old dream reminds you
How the endless road unwinds you

While you see a chance, take it
Find romance, fake it
Because itâs all on you

Donât you know by now
No one gives you anything
And donât you wonder how you keep on moving
One more day, your way
Go your way

When thereâs no one left to leave you
Even you donât quite believe you
Thatâs when nothing can deceive you

While you see a chance, take it
Find romance, fake it
Because itâs all on you

Stand up in a clear blue morning
Until you see, what can be
Alone in a cold day dawning
Are you still free, can you be

And that old gray wind is blowing
And thereâs nothing left worth knowing
And itâs time you should be going

While you see a chance, take it
Find romance, fake it
Because itâs all on you

While you see a chance, take it
Find romance
While you see a chance, take it
Because itâs all on you!
