Stand up in a clear blue morning
Until you see what can be
Alone in a cold day dawning
Are you still free? Can you be?

When some cold tomorrow finds you
When some sad old dream reminds you
How the endless road unwinds you

While you see a chance take it
Find romance fake it
Because its all on you

Dont you know by now
No one gives you anything?
And don't you wonder how you keep on moving?
One more day your way, oh your way

When theres no one left to leave you
Even you don't quite believe you
Thats when nothing can deceive you

While you see a chance take it
Find romance fake it
Because its all on you

Stand up in a clear blue morning
Until you see what can be
Alone in a cold day dawning
Are you still free? Can you be?

And that old gray wind is blowing
And theres nothing left worth knowing
And its time you should be going

While you see a chance take it
Find romance fake it
Because its all on you

While you see a chance take it
Find romance
While you see a chance take it
Find romance

While you see a chance take it
Find romance
While you see a chance take it
Find romance

While you see a chance take it
Find romance
While you see a chance take it
Find romance
