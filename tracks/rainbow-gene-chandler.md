There's a rainbow
In my heart
That reminds me
Of how we parted
And I, I know
My love is gone forever
But deep down in my heart
I'll love her forever

There's a rainbow, oh in my heart
Baby, baby, baby
Come on darling baby
Please try to

I'm down on my knees, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Please listen to my plea, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm looking up above oh, yes, up above
Pray for your love, ohyeah
Please, please stop this rainbow, oh in my heart
Baby, baby, baby, come on darling baby
Come on stop this rainbow, ha, ha, yeah

Come on now baby, and stop this rainbow
And I know the things I done to you was wrong
I'm asking you to give me one more chance, just one more chance to
Prove to you, that I know I was wrong
X2and I realize now baby
That love only comes once and when it
Comes you better grab it, cause it may not come no more
X5and I'm askin you baby

And you look so good to me baby
You look so good this evening baby
Sometimes when I look out at you baby
I feel like I just want to
X2I just want to reach out
I want to reach out baby, I just want to reach out
I want to reach out and...bite

X2 and I just want to ask you one thing baby
X3 I just want to ask you one thing
One thing baby
I want you, to stop, stop this rainbow in my heart
