Woo


If you don't know how I feel for you
It's time
I let all feelings show
I love you
And I'll never let you go
No, baby

Right now we're just friends
But I pray someday
You'll surrender to love so tender
I won't push you
As long as you know that my love is true


Get closer to you, baby
Hey
Closer than just friends

I want to
Get closer to you, baby
Hey
Closer than just friends

How about you?
How about you?


It's hard to explain
When you're close to me
I get a warm sensation inside

I can't deny this
I want to try it
Each and every time you come by

Girl, I don't wanna lose your love
By putting my cards on the table
You know I'm thankful

For what we have
But I have feelings inside
They're so strong
I can't hide



How about you?


I know you're probably thinking
That you heard this so many times before

But, girl
When you're here
I want you to stay

And when you're gone
I want you even more every day


Girl, I don't wanna lose your love
By putting my cards on the table
You know I'm thankful

For what we have
But I have feelings inside
They're so strong
I can't hide



Get closer to you, baby
(How about you?)
Hey

My baby
My baby
Whoa, whoa

To you, lady
Hey, yeah
Closer than friends

Me and you
Woo
I want to

How 'bout
'Bout you
Whoa, oh

Nothing I won't do
To get close to you
Baby, yeah
