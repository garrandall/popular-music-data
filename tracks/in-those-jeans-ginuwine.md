Looking good plenty time 
(suga')
Is there any more room for me 
(make a little more room for me in those jeans)
In those jeans
Pretty thick like I like it
Tell me is there any more room for me 
(make a little more room for me in those jeans)
In those jeans
Looking tasty really scrumptious
Tell me is there any more room for me 
(make a little more room for me in those jeans)
Looking good plenty time 
Is there any more room for me
(make a little more room for me in those jeans)


Got damn
Look at the way that you wearing them jeans
I wanna get lost somewhere in them jeans
And grind my way around
I wanna get lost and find my way around
And hit that spot
In your coke bottle shape
I hope I make the bottle break
And make your soda spill while your body shake
And bubble up, I'ma fuck the love
It's GANGSTA!
The way I like
That make a nigga wanna taste the bite
The way your waiste look right
I'll hit it from the back so long 
that I forget what your face look like
I wanna work..forget what a date look like
But uh..I'll show you what a henny straight look like
And uh..Wanna get between them seems
So make a little more room for me in those jeans




You are the bomb
Girl you tight to death
I don't know the words to say to you
All that i know, baby all i know is
that
I'm loving what I see and I'm feeling you
I wanna know, all I wanna know is if
I could have what's up in those
jeans
Baby can I have what's up in those jeans
Don't get alarmed cause I don't mean no harm
But I love the way you
wear those jeans
Levis, Prada, BabyPhat, I love them
Love the way you, wearing them I love them can
Calvin, Iceberg,
Sergio, I love them
Trying to get inside of those


Aye, Aye, Aye
I wanna push your legs to the back of your head
To the back of the headboard then back to the bed
Then its back to the floor, back to the bed
Then back to the floor with your back to the floor
It's GANGSTA!
The way I like
Your holding it back I'm rubbing your back
And when I'm pulling your hair
Throw it back
And I'ma show you where to throw it at
I know how to open that and touch them thighs
And make your love come down, multiply (wha)
I know your body shake up inside (wha)
You ever had that? (oh) You never had that (no)
You ever had your ass smacked
And did it all night 'til you had a bad back (whoa)
So let me get in between them seems
And make a little more room for me in those jeans


I wanna say that them jeans looking good fitting right
Baby damn those jeans (make a little room for me)
Any kind doesn't matter you could win 'em
you look fine
Baby damn those jeans (make a little room for me)
Anytime that I see you I want in, you wear them well
Baby damn those jeans (make a little room for me)
You
the shit you the bomb
All I wanna know is can I have what's in those jeans
(jus make a little more room for me in those jeans)
Can I get in those can I baby
