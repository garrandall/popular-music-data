And so the hustlers continue to hustle
And the player's continue to play


I'm a man today
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
Got a hold on life
Taking each day, by day
Being strong, know just where I'm going to
As I get higher and higher
Dreams grow, visions flow by
This is as good as it gets
As I take another hit, sugar
I can't stop, I won't stop


Cause I'm too cool (Too cool)
And what they say is true
Oh, I'm full of smoke
Cause I'm too cool (Too cool)
And what they say is true
Oh, I'm full of smoke

Watching my life go down (Down)
Watching my life go down (Down, down, down)
Watching my life go down (Down)
Watching my life go down (Oh)


And all the day, time just passes by me slowly
But I'm alright, you'll see
Faces and places catching different cases
True runners it's glorified
Same situation, nothin' ever changes
Just being a bonafide hustler
Hustler, baby
From day to night
Business is as good as it gets
As I take another hit, honey
I won't stop, I won't stop


Cause I'm too cool (The man today)
And what they say is true
Oh, I'm full of smoke (Im full of smoke)
Cause I'm too cool (Too cool)
And what they say is true
Oh, I'm full of smoke (Oh)

Watching my life go down (Down)
Watching my life go down (Cause I'm a hustler)
Watching my life go down (Keep on hustlin' baby)
Watching my life go down (Down, down, down)

I'm the man today
Can't tell me nothing


Cause I'm too cool
And what they say is true
Oh, I'm full of smoke (Full of smoke)
Cause I'm too cool
And what they say is true (Straight player)
Oh, I'm full of smoke

Watching my life go down (Down)
Watching my life go down (True runners it's glorified)
Watching my life go down (Same situation, nothin' ever changes)
Watching my life go down (Just being a bonified hustler)
Watching my life go down (Hustler)
Watching my life go down (I'm a hustler)
Watching my life go down (Straight hustler)
Watching my life go down (Money maker, Body taker)
