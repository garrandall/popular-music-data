Pretty charms, pretty little charms
See how they sparkle in the sun
Ding dong ding listen to them ring
They seem to be telling everyone
That you're my baby
With a twist of your wrist it can be told
You're my baby
There it is, in fourteen carat golden

Pretty charms, pretty little charms
Starting from the day we met
The Sweet Sixteen, the moments in between
That New Year's Eve we won't forget
So if some guy should ask you
If some night you're free
Wave him away with a wave of your arms
Do as I say, just blind 'em with your charms
And show him you belong to me

So if some guy should ask you
If some night you're free
Wave him away with a wave of your arms
Do what I say, just blind 'em with your charms
And show him you belong to me

(Pretty charms, pretty little charms)
(Pretty charms, pretty little charms)
(Pretty charms, pretty little charms)
