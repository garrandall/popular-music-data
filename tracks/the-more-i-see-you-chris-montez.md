The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, and my heart won't try

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, and my heart won't try
