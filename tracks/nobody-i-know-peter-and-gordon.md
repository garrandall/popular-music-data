Nobody I know could love me more than you
You can give me so much love it seems untrue
Listen to the bird who sings it to the tree
And then when you've heard him see if you agree
Nobody I know could love you more than me

Everywhere I go the sun comes shinin' through
Everyone I know is sure it shines for you
Even in my dreams I look into your eyes
Suddenly it seems I've found a paradise
Everywhere I go the sun comes shinin' through

It means so much to be a part
Of a heart of a wonderful one
When other lovers are gone
We'll live on
We'll live on

Even in my dreams I look into your eyes
Suddenly it seems I've found a paradise
Everywhere I go the sun comes shinin' through

Nobody I know could love me more than you
You can give me so much love it seems untrue
Listen to the bird who sings it to the tree
And then when you've heard him see if you agree
Nobody I know could love you more than me
Nobody I know could love you more than me
