When you wake up and she's next to you
You can't stand what she's putting you through
Can't take no more so I'm going away


I can't stand it no more
I can't stand it no more
I can't stand it no more
I can't stand it no more


Every day, I feel a different man
Caught adrift and there's no sight of land
Hey baby, do I come back to you




Every woman made a fool out of me
My mama told me when she set me free
She said, "Son, you just have got to find
Find a girl who will treat you like I do"


I can't stand it no more, I'm going away
I can't stand it no more, don't ask me to stay
I can't stand it no more, because there's nothing left to say
I can't stand it no more


I can't stand it no more, I'm going away
I can't stand it no more, there's nothing left to say
