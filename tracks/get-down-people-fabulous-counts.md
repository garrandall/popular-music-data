Crime, corruption, courage
Power, pussy, paper
Beef, bullets and barristers
It's all a dangerous cycle
CPB... Blah Blah Blah Blow

Crime, corruption and courage
Three reasons that I rated the olders
Now I got weight on my shoulders like luggage
In school I never studied
At 3: 15 home I never hurried, now mums worried
Is she ever gonna see her son flourish?
A lot of my friends have been duppied
Knife to the stomach, the lord soon cometh
I don't wanna burn in hell
Or do a bird in jail, I felt a warmer shell
And sometimes when I curse my girl
I wanna resort to violence
In the long run I'll be hurt as well
I don't wanna work but I got work for sale
Some niggas have got keys like they work for Yale
Police hate when the worst prevail
It's old evidence, stop tryna preserve what's stale

It's a dangerous cycle
Can't tell a mate from a rival (C)
Blades and rifles
Are more than an aid to survival (P)
It's a dangerous cycle
Can't tell a mate from a rival (B)
Blades and rifles
Are more than an aid to survival (CPB)

Power, pussy and paper
The dreams of a teen, things ain't what they seem
Blades and machines still stick place in between
Your waist and your jeans
Manna do a mad ting for the taste of the cream
Some take to the green
And start shottin' H to the fiends
I stay fresh to death, down to my laces are clean
I'm in love with the face of the queen
I'm paper possessed
I'm bound to be paid for my scheme
I'm so far from aimless
Money makes my brain tick
Ain't nothing like pussy and a payslip, face it
I'm never gonna tell you how, my trades sacred
But when I'm low you'll never know where I'm allocated
Still I expect respect cause man know I ain't naked
Because I guess I'd be a victim of hatred

It's a dangerous cycle
Can't tell a mate from a rival (C)
Blades and rifles
Are more than an aid to survival (P)
It's a dangerous cycle
Can't tell a mate from a rival (B)
Blades and rifles
Are more than an aid to survival (CPB)

Beef, bullets and barristers
Nowadays the streets are filled with cameras
Still it's so hazardous
Some get brung back to life like Nazareth
Yeah it's miraculous
I tell amateurs "stay to the side" like bannisters
When I say I've got metal they think I mean canisters
Wars I've had you couldn't count on an abacus
I'm so calamitous
My names Ghetto but life ain't fabulous
Everyday I'm around clamorous characters
Some think the gun ting's so glamorous
But in a shootout what you gonna do now?
Leave him with a hole the size of two pound
You won't bust save yourself the embarrassment
Believe me I know all about arrogance
Even when you know it's precarious

It's a dangerous cycle
Can't tell a mate from a rival (C)
Blades and rifles
Are more than an aid to survival (P)
It's a dangerous cycle
Can't tell a mate from a rival (B)
Blades and rifles
Are more than an aid to survival (CPB)

Yeah...
You have to take time out and think what you're doing man
Always think first
I've made mistakes... that you can learn from... true stories
(C) stands for cash
(P) stands for Plaistow
(B) stands for MY borough, ya dun know
CPB!

It's a dangerous cycle
Can't tell a mate from a rival (C)
Blades and rifles
Are more than an aid to survival (P)
It's a dangerous cycle
Can't tell a mate from a rival (B)
Blades and rifles
Are more than an aid to survival (CPB)

You know you got slow people yeah?
And they STILL won't know what CPB means
Gotta break it down like this...
The Cycle ain't a Pedal Bike
G-H
