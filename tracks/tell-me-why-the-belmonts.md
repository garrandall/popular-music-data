Tell me why..
Though I try to forget
Tell me why..
Why I think of you yet..
I know I'll never be free..
What has happened to me..

Tell me why..
When we danced until three
Tell me why
Why my heart couldn't see..
I never dreamed of romance..
Never gave it a chance..

When I think of how you looked that day..
In your gown of silk and lace..
Should have known the day you came my way..
That this was the time and the place..

Tell me why
I keep fooling my heart
When I know
It was love from the start..
Why don't we give it a try..
If you know tell me why..

Tell me why..
I keep fooling my heart..
When I know
It was love from the start..
Why don't we give it a try..
If you know tell me why..
Tell me...Tell me... Why!
