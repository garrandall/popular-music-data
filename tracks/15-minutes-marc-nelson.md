15 minutes-marc nelson

Damn, what time is it
All snap, I gotta go to work
Hold up a minute

Chorus
All I got is 15 minutes, and I wanna get up in it
Ain't got no time to talk, just come and break me off
Ain't got no time for love, just come and give me some
Ain't got no time to talk, just come and break me off

7:45 on the dot, guess I'm late for work but I'm feeling kind of hot
I see you downstairs pouring juice
Flippin my eggs but I wanna flip you

Because your, standing right there in your negligÃ©e
Thinking should I hit it but damn I'm late (damn I'm late)
Maybe a quickie would make my day (oh)
It'll make my day, it'll make my day oh oh

Chorus 2x

I think I wanna hit it again, call my boss and tell him I won't be in
I bet he's gonna wanna know why, and I just can't tell him no lie
She laying right here in her negligee (negligee)
Right now I don't care just cut my pay (cut my pay)
You'd do the same if you were in my place, with that booty up in yak face

Chorus 2x

The first two minutes girl were gonna take out time
Freak you down hit you from behind
The next three minutes oh were gonna get on the floor
Say my name and make me want some more
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 turing on the side
Hurry up scream it out, let it go girl
And when you arrive our time is up
So scream much louder

Chorus (until fade)
