Fun is in
It's no sin
It's that time again
To shed your load
Hit the road
On the run again
Summer skies
In our eyes
And a warmer sun
It's one for all
All for one
All for all out fun

Gotta go to it
Gonna go through it
Gotta get with it

Lookin' good
Down the hood
Of a funky ride
On the way
To the tide
Just to tan your hide
In the shade
Lemonade
In the sun ocean spray
To get your face
In the race
Or lay back's no disgrace

Gotta go to it
Gonna go through it
Gotta get with it

It's OK to get out there and
Have some fun
By yourself maybe
Or else with a special one.
Good or bad
Glad or sad
I'ts all gonna pass
So it's OK
Let's all play
And enjoy it while it lasts

Gotta go to it
Gonna go through it
Gotta get with it

Find a ride
Find a ride
Find a ride (In the sum-sum-summertime dit dit)
Find a ride (In the sum-sum-summertime dit dit)
Find a ride (In the sum-sum-summertime dit dit)
Find a ride (In the sum-sum-summertime dit dit)
Find a ride (In the sum-sum-summertime dit dit)
Find a ride (In the sum-sum-summertime dit dit)
Find a ride (In the sum-sum-summmertime dit dit)
Find a ride (In the sum-sum-summertime dit dit)
Find a ride (In the sum-sum-summertime dit dit)
