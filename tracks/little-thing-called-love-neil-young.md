See somebody
walkin' down the street
Hangin' head
and a-shufflin' feet
Don't take much to see
What they've been thinkin' of.
What makes you hypnotized?
What puts a tear in your eye?
What makes you have to choose?
What brings you the blues?
A little thing called love
A little thing called love.

Only love puts a tear in your eye
Only love makes you hypnotized
Only love makes you choose
Only love brings you the blues.

Wait a minute now, honey
Don't be sad
This may be
the best love you ever had
That don't mean
that you had enough
A little thing called love
A little thing called love.

Only love puts a tear in your eye
Only love makes you hypnotized
Only love makes you choose
Only love brings you the blues.

A little thing called love
A little thing called love.
