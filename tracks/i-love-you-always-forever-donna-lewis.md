Feels like I'm standing in a timeless dream
Of light mists with pale amber rose
Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent
Touching, discovering you


Those days of warm rains come rushing back to me
Miles of windless summer night air (summer night air)
Secret moments shared in the heat of the afternoon
Out of the stillness, soft spoken words
Say, say it again


I love you always forever
Near and far, close and together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you (say, say it again)
I love you always forever
Near and far, close and together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you


You've got the most unbelievable blue eyes I've ever seen
You've got me almost melting away
As we lay there under a blue sky with pure white stars
Exotic sweetness, a magical time
Say, say it again


I love you always forever
Near and far, close and together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you (Say, say it again)
I love you always forever
Near and far, close and together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you


Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always and everywhere and every-
Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always and everywhere and every-
Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always and everywhere and every-
Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always and everywhere and everything


I love you always forever
Near and far, close and together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
I love you always forever
Near and far, close and together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
I love you always forever
Near and far, close and together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
I love you always forever
Near and far, close and together
Everywhere I will be with you
