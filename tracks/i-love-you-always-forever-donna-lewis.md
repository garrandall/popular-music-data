Feels like I'm standing in a timeless dream
Of light mist, of pale amber rose
Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent
Touching, discovering you

Those days of warm rains come rushing back to me
Miles of windless summer night air
Secret moments shut in the heat of the afternoon
Out of the stillness, soft spoken words

I love you always, forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Every sin, I will do for you
I love you always, forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Every sin, I will do for you

You've got the most unbelievable blue eyes I've ever seen
You've got me almost wilting away
As we lay there, under a blue sky with pure white stars
It's all the sweetness, magical time

I love you always, forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Every sin, I will do for you
I love you always, forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Every sin, I will do for you

Say you'll l-love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always
And everywhere and every
Say you'll l-love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always
And everywhere and every
Say you'll l-love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always
And everywhere and every
Say you'll l-love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always
And everywhere and everything

I love you always, forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Every sin, I will do for you
I love you always, forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Every sin, I will do for you
I love you always, forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Every sin, I will do for you
