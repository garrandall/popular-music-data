Whenever I feel like givin' up
Whenever my sunshine turns to rain
Whenever my hopes and dreams
Are aimed in the wrong direction
She's always there
Tellin' me how much she cares
She's always in my hair

She's always in my hair
My hair

Whenever I feel like not too great at all
Whenever I'm all alone
And even if I hit the wrong notes
She's always in my boat
She's always there
Tellin' me how much she cares
She's always in my hair

She's always in my hair
My hair

Maybe I'll marry her (Maybe I'll marry her)
Maybe I won't (Maybe I won't)
Maybe I will not (Maybe I will not)
Lemme tell ya (Even if I was a gigolo)
If I was a gigolo all my life (All my life)
She'd still be there (She'd still be there)
Tellin' me just how much she really cares (She cares)
She's always in my hair

She's always in my hair
My hair

Listen
Whenever I feel like givin' up
Whenever my sunshine turns to rain
Whenever my hopes and dreams
Are aimed in the wrong direction
She's always there
Tellin' me just how much she cares (Tellin' me how much she cares)
Tellin' me... she's always in my hair (Always in my hair)

She's always in my hair
My hair

She's always in my hair
