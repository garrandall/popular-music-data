Cause its all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I canât keep picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad, yeah
Cause itâs all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again
And I canât take it yeah I canât shake it
Nooo

I canât wait to see you
Want to see if you still got that look in your eyes
That one you had for me before we said our goodbyes
And itâs a shame that we got to spend our time
Being mad about the same things
Over and over again
About the same things
Over and over again
Ohh
But I think sheâs leaving
Ooh man sheâs leaving
I donât know what else to do
(I Canât go on not loving you)

Cause its all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I canât keep picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad, yeah
Cause its all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again yeah
And I canât take it yeah I canât shake it
Nooo

I remember the day you left
I remember the last breath you took right in front of me
When you said that u would leave
I was too damn stubborn to try to stop you or say anything
But I see clearly now 
And this choice I made keeps playing in my head
Over and over again
Playing my head
Over and over again
Ohh
I think sheâs leaving
Ooh man sheâs leaving
I donât know what else to do
(I Canât go on not loving you)

Cause its all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I canât keep picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad, yeah
Cause its all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again 
And I canât take it I canât shake it
Nooo

(Now that Iâve realized that Iâm going down
From all this pain youâve put me through
Every time I close my eyes I lock it down oh
I canât go on not loving you)

Cause its all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I canât keep picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad, yeah
Cause its all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again
And I canât take it I canât shake it
Nooo

Cause its all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I canât keep picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad, yeah
Cause its all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again
And I canât take it I canât shake it
Nooo

Over and Over again
Over and Over again
Cause itâs all in my head
