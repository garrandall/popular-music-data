Let's pretend for one night, I'm the man in your life
And we do the things that lovers do
All the loving u like 
I give it to you just right
Theres nothing less than special when it comes to you
See what we have is understanding
That works so well for how we are
Cause neither of us has the heart to fall in love all over again


Even though I'm not your man and I know you're not my girl 
But let's just act like it's that way tonight
Now I know u got your friends and you know I got some too
But let's just act like you're my lady tonight

Now what I like about you 
Is that you're always so cool and comfortable whenever I'm around
You're some one that I can talk too
No matter what I'm going through I call on you cuz I know you'll always be down
See what we have is so incredible
That we'll never find in anyone else
This thing that we share is so unbelievable
That I want you all to myself


Even though I'm not your man and I know you're not my girl 
But let's just act like it's that way tonight
Now I know you got your friends and you know I got some too
But let's just act like you're my lady tonight

Oh, I know that we both have our separate lives
And we don't keep ties on each other
So you can have me 
So that I can hold you until the morning comes
Then we can go back to how things was before




Tonight
Tonight
Umm dada da badum, yeah

I like it (I like it) 
I love it (I love it)
It feels good to me (it feels good to me)
So good to me (so good to me)
