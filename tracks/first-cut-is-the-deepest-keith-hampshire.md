I would have given you all of my heart
But there's someone who's torn it apart
And she's taken almost all that I've got
But if you want, I'll try to love again
Baby, I'll try to love again, but I know

Baby I know, the first cut is the deepest
But when it comes to being lucky she's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me she's the worst
But when it comes to being loved, she's first
That's how I know
Baby I know, the first cut is the deepest

I still want you by my side
Just to help me dry the tears that I have cried
And I'm sure gonna give you a try
And if you want, I'll try to love again
Baby, I'll try to love again, but I know

Baby I know, the first cut is the deepest
'Cause when it comes to being lucky she's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me she's the worst
And when it comes to being loved, she's first
That's how I know
Baby I know, the first cut is the deepest

Baby I know, The first cut is the deepest
Yes, I know, the first cut is the deepest
'Cause when it comes to being lucky she's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me she's the worst
That's how I know, the first cut is the deepest
Baby I know, the first cut is the deepest
Yes I know, the first cut is the deepest
Yes, Yes I know, the first cut is the deepest...
(Repeat to fade)
