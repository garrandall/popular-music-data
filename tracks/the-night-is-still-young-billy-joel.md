I'm young enough to still see the passionate boy I used to be
But I'm old enough to say I got a good look at the other side
I know we got to work real hard, maybe even for the rest of our lives
But right now I just want to take what I can
Get tonight

While the night is still young
I want to keep making love to you
While the night is still young

I'd like to settle down
Get married
And maybe have a child someday
I can see a time coming when I'm gonna throw my suitcase out
No more separations
Where you have to say goodnight to a telephone
Baby I've decided that ain't what life is all about

Oh
While the night is still young
While the night is still young
I want to try to make the world brand new
While the night is still young

Rock and roll music was the only thing I
Ever gave a damn about
There was something that was missing
But I never used to wonder why
Now I know you're the one I needed
To make things right again
And I may lose the battle
But you're giving me the will to try

Oh
While the night is still young
Because the night is still young
I've got a lot of catching up to do
While the night is still young

While the night is still young
I want to try to make the world brand new
While the night is still young
