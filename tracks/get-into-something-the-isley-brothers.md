Love, let me know, let me know
Love, let me know, let me know, let me know

When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard for me to tell you so
You may not be in the mood
To learn what you think you know

There are times when I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see

But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know

Love, let me know, let me know

When you feel what you feel
Oh, how hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place
Before this love affair began

But if you feel, oh, like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
What I say I'm all about, all about

But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know

No no no no

Tell me what it is
There's no need to make believe
Make believe, no need to make believe
Look beyond your world
Try to find a place for me
Try to find, find a place for me

'Cause at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
And if you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know

Let me know, let me know
Let me know, oh
Love
Oh, baby
Stay at your best baby, yeah
Please do it for God's sakes
