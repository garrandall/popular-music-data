(Vince Gill)

I'm Almost Ready
To let you know just how bad I feel
I'm Almost Ready
To let you loose and find another heart to steal

My friends tell me that they see you
Runnin' around all over town
Please don't make me out to be your fool
Please don't make me out a clown... 'cause

I'm Almost Ready
To let you know just how bad I feel
I'm Almost Ready
To let you loose and find another heart to steal

I don't know who you think you're foolin'
I hope you don't think that it's me
It's plain to see that you don't love me anymore
I'll say goodbye and you'll be free... 'cause

I'm Almost Ready
To let you know just how bad I feel
I'm Almost Ready
To let you loose and find another heart to steal

I'm Almost Ready
To let you know just how bad I feel
I'm Almost Ready
To let you loose and find another heart to steal
To let you loose and find another heart to steal
To let you loose and find another heart to steal
