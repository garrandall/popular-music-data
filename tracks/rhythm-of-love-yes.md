Innocence, no answer to your breaking heart
If the situation sometimes falls apart
Then in this ecstasy, your charms are frozen
No emotion falling through your arms


Morning daydream, time still growing shorter
Take me over, lead me to the water


To the rhythm of love
To the rhythm of love
The rhythm of love


Why should I escort you to your secret needs?
Climbing up your ladder, I keep falling down
Anyway will do, anyone will do when you dance to your darkest tune
Surrounded, as you crawl around the room


Night time fever, burning 'til you're higher
Take me over, lead me through the fire


The rhythm of love
To the rhythm of love
The rhythm of love
To the rhythm of love

Morning daydream (the rhythm of love)
Midnight fever
Morning daydream
Midnight fever


Inhibitions keep you from your point of view
(Information leading to confusing)
In this situation I have found you in
To the rhythm of-


Morning daydream
Midnight fever (the rhythm of love)
Morning daydream
Midnight fever (to the rhythm of love)
The rhythm of love
The rhythm of love
To the rhythm of love
Rhythm of love
