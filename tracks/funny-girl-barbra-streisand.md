Funny
Did you hear that?
Funny
Yeah, the guy said
"Honey, you're a funny girl."

That's me
I just keep them in stitches
Doubled in half
And though I may be all wrong for a guy
I'm good for a laugh

I guess it's not funny
Life is far from sunny
When the laugh is over
And the joke's on you

A girl oughta have a sense of humor
That's one thing you really need for sure
When you're a funny girl
The fella said "A funny girl"

Funny
How it ain't so funny
Funny girl
