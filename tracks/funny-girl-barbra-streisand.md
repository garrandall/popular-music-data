Funny
Did you hear that?
Funny
Yes, the guy said, "honey, you're a funny girl"

That's me, I just keep them in stitches
Doubled in half
And though I may be all wrong for the guy
I'm good for a laugh

I guess it's not funny, life is far from sunny
When the laugh is over and the joke's on you
A girl ought to have a sense of humour
That's one thing, you really need for sure

When you're a funny girl
The fella said, "a funny girl"
Funny how it ain't so funny
Funny girl
