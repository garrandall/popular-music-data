Come on, ease on down
Ease on down the road
Come on, ease on down
Ease on down the road

Don't you carry nothing
That might be a load
Come on, ease on down
Ease on down the road

Come on, ease on down
Ease on down the road
Come on, ease on down
Ease on down the road

Don't you carry nothing
That might be a load
Come on, ease on down
Ease on down the road

Well, there may be times
When you think
You've lost your mind
And the steps you're taken
Leave you three full steps behind

Just you keep on keeping on
The road that you choose
Don't you give up walking
Cause you gave up shoes

Come on, ease on down the road
Come on, ease on down the road

Don't you carry nothing
That might be a load
Come on, ease on down
Ease on down the road

Kick your left foot up
When your right foot's down
Come on, legs keep moving
Don't you lose no ground

Cause the road you're walking
Might be long sometimes
But just keep on stepping
And you'll be just fine

Ease, ease on down the road
Ease, doo doo doo

Don't you carry nothing
That might be a load
Come on, ease on down
Ease on down

Do do do, do do do
Ease on down
Ease on down
Ease on down the road

Do do do, do do do
Ease on down
Ease on down
Ease on down the road

Do do do, do do do
Don't you carry nothing
That might be a load

Come on, ease on down
Ease on down, down the
Ease on down
Ease on down the
Ease on down
Ease on down the road

Kick your left foot up
When your right foot's down
Come on, legs keep moving
Don't you lose no ground

Cause the road you're walking
Might be long sometimes
But just keep on stepping
And you'll be just fine

Ease, ease on down the road
Ease, doo doo doo

Don't you carry nothing
That might be a load
Come on, ease on down
Ease on down the

Ease on down, ease on down
Ease on down, ease on down

Do do do, do do do
Do do do, do do do

Ease on down
Ease on down the road
Ease on down
Ease on down the road

Ease on down
Ease on down the road
Ease on down
Ease on down the road...

Come and and ease on
Ease on down the road
Come and and ease on
Ease on down the road...
