I get this feeling
Whenever I touch you
I kept believing
That some day you'd feel it too
You kept the fire burning deep in my heart
I never knew

You played along, and took what you needed
I was wrong to think I could ever get through
You've got this way of making your love slip through

When I'm holding you tight
When I'm holding you tight
Now girl
I can't let you know
That I'm on to ya
I can't let you go
And make it so that

When I'm holding you tight
Baby it's when I'm holding you tight
Now girl
I can't let you know
That I'm on to ya
I can't let you go
When I'm holding you tight

So many nights
Alone in the darkness
Just me and you
Both had someone to use
We played a game with no rules
Felt we couldn't lose

I needed love but wanted a lover
I needed someone, and it coulda been another like you
You got this way of making your love slip through

When I'm holding you tight
When I'm holding you tight
Now girl
I can't let you know
That I'm on to ya
I can't let you go
And make it so that

When I'm holding you tight
Baby it's when I'm holding you tight
Now girl
I can't let you know
That I'm on to ya
I can't let you go
When I'm holding you tight

When I'm holding you tight
You make me feel like I'm someone
And it all seemed so right
We close our eyes and it takes off
And I guess that in the end
We had each other
Whatever reasons we
We still needed one another

Baby, when I'm holding you tight
When I'm holding you tight
Now girl, I
I can't let you know
That I'm on to ya
I can't let you go
And make it so that

When I'm holding you tight
Baby it's when I'm holding you tight
Now girl
I can't let you know
That I'm on to ya
I can't let you go
When I'm holding you tight

Oh, baby
When I'm holding you tight
I can't let you know
That I'm on to ya
