I bought a bourgeois house in the Hollywood hills 
With a trunkload of hundred thousand dollar bills 
Man came by to hook up my cable TV 
We settled in for the night my baby and me 
We switched 'round and 'round 'til half-past down 
There was fifty-seven channels and notin' on 

Well now home entertainment was my baby's wish 
So I hopped into town for a satellite dish 
I tied it to the top of my Japanese car 
I came home and I pointed it out into the stars 
A message came back from the great beyond 
There's fifty-seven channnels and nothin' on 

Well we might' a made some friends with some billionaires 
We might' a got all nice and friendly 
If we'd made it upstairs 
All I got was a note that said "Bye-bye John 
Our love is fifty-seven channels and nothin' on" 

So I bought a .44 magnum it was solid steel cast 
And in the blessed name of Elvis well I just let it blast 
'Til my TV lay in pieces there at my feet 
And they bsted me for disturbin' the almighty peace 
Judge said "What you got in your defense son ?" 
"Fifty-seven channels and nothin' on" 
I can see by your eyes friend you're just about gone 
Fifty-seven channels and nothin' on 
Fifty-seven channels and nothin'...
