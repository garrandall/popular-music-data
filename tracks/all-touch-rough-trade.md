Gentlemen, start your engines

 rubber, turnin' my fast car
Racin' to the Sprint Cup 'cause I'm NASCAR
Call me Robby, Jeff, or Dale Earnhardt
Gentlemen, start your engines, it's NASCAR
Number one, I'll never be the last car
Finish line's all mine 'cause I'm NASCAR
Sorry, it's time to go party
Left y'all in the dust

Sprint Cup from Daytona to Talladega
Colt Ford gear shiftin' at the  speedway
You can call me Jimmie Johnson, board leader all day
Got the Chevy  car without keys
Five hundred laps to go, and the track is all me
Too many sponsors on my car from Kellogg's to Kraft Cheese
That's me walkin' in 
My game plan is simple, son I came to win
Just give me a Budweiser, this one for Rough Rider

Chase to Bank America, my gas tank full now
See the checker flag drop, I'm feelin' good now
Foot to the pedal, asphalt touchin' rubber
Used to watch Richard Petty growin' up, I learned from it
My pit crew sick too, it's like Amazing Grace
I say a prayer 'fore the helmet touch my face

 rubber, turnin' my fast car
Racin' to the Sprint Cup 'cause I'm NASCAR
Call me Robby, Jeff, or Dale Earnhardt
Gentlemen, start your engines, it's NASCAR
Number one, I'll never be the last car
Finish line's all mine 'cause I'm NASCAR
Sorry, it's time to go party
Left y'all in the dust

I wanna go fast, it's either first or last
So we can bang and trade paint if you're trying to pass
I feel the need for speed, guess I was born to do it
It's a crash , pick a line and drive through it
My fuel's gettin' low, but I got to go
This is NASCAR baby, ain't no time for slow
If you wanna come get it, we could walk the ground
But I'm here for one thing, and that's the finish line
Runnin' side by side with smoke and Kurt Busch
 comin' fast, can't stop, I gotta push
Casey Mears and Mark Martin in the outside groove
Kasey Kahne goin' low, but they all too slow
Old  got the lead with twenty laps to go
See ya all at victory lane where they pop the champagne
Dodge and Toyota, even Chevy and Ford
I love 'em all, baby doll, when the pedal's to the floor

 rubber, turnin' my fast car
Racin' to the Sprint Cup 'cause I'm NASCAR
Call me Robby, Jeff, or Dale Earnhardt
Gentlemen, start your engines, it's NASCAR
Number one, I'll never be the last car
Finish line's all mine 'cause I'm NASCAR
Sorry, it's time to go party
Left y'all in the dust

Hey, Colt
You look pretty good out there, buddy
I'm comin', baby
I know you wanna win
I came to win
You got to slow down
You're all over the track
Don't crash that car
You'll be in trouble if you crash that car
Don't worry about it son, I got it
How far back are they?
I don't know, just slow down
I can't slow down baby, this is NASCAR
I'll see y'all at the finish line
