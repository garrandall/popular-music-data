Always the life of the party
Always the clown of the class
All of my friends see me happy baby
But happy is only a mask

Nobody knows when I'm alone inside my room
I sing another tune

I'm goin' down
When I hear the sound
The sound of my tears
When you're not around
It's all I can do
When I listen to
The sound of my tears baby when I'm missing you

Don't mind the sounds of the city baby
Don't mind the noise of the crowd
Just when I'm lonely with my thoughts of you
The silence is always too loud

Pay it no mind
You know the truth behind the smile
It's only just a lie



Pay it no mind
You know the truth behind the smile
It's only just a lie
