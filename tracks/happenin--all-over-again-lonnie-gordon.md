Oh! Happening all over again
I was such a fool
To think that you would
Ever change your way
Even put your hand
Upon your heart and
Said that no one else
Can take my place

How was I so blind?
I trusted every single
Word you said
I know I should've seen
The light but I just let
Your love go to
My head

I've taken you back before
'Cause you told me you changed
Looked in my eyes
(And said)

Believe me than you
Broke my heart and
Deceived me when you said you
Never could leave me but it's
Happening all over again
No! No! No!

I promised to myself
I'd never make the same mistakes again
And though I looked for someone else
I never really want to walk away

It seems that your just the same
I forgot all the pain
Looked in your eyes
(You said)

Believe me
Than you
Broke my heart and
Deceived me when you said you
Never could leave me but it's
Happening all over again
(Happening all over again)
No! No! No!

Believe me than you
Broke my heart and
Deceived me when you said you
Never could leave me but it's
Happening all over again
(But it's happening all over again)

Hey 'cause it's happening all over
It's happening all over again
Oh yeah!

It seems that your just the same
I forgot all the pain
Looked in your eyes

Believe me then you
Broke my heart and
Deceived me when you said you
Never could leave me but it's
Happening all over again
(Happening all over again)
No! No! No!

Believe me than you
Broke my heart and
Deceived me when you said you
Never could leave me but it's
Happening all over again
(Happening all over again)
No! No! No!

(Believe me)
Oh you broke my heart and tore it apart
(Deceived me)
You said
(Said you never could leave me)
(But it's happening all over again)
Again and again and again
No! No! No!

Believe me
Deceived me
Ever could leave me
But it's happening all over again
