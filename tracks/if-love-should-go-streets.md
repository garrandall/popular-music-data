I used to keep a little distance
Once bitten, twice shy
I paid the price for pleasure
To hear some young girl sigh
I thought I got what I needed
And then you came along
I couldn't take it, I couldn't fake it
When you proved that I was wrong

If love should go
I want to be the last to know
Don't say no
I'll believe a lie
If love should go
I want to be the last to know
I don't want to hear it
I don't want to cry

Please let me get closer
And fire up the second stage
'Cause when you touch me I feel
Like lion breaking down it's cage
Thought I was all that you needed
I thought everything was fine
Now I'm insisting, you keep resisting
Is somebody on the line?

If love should go
I want to be the last to know
Don't say no
I'll believe a lie
If love should go
I want to be the last to know
I don't want to hear it
I don't want to cry

I don't want to know the circumstances
And I don't want to take no second chances

If love should go
I want to be the last to know
Don't say no
I'll believe a lie
If love should go
I want to be the last to know
I don't want to hear it
I don't want to cry

If love should go
I want to be the last to know
Don't say no
I'll believe a lie
If love should go
I want to be the last to know
I don't want to hear it
I don't want to cry
