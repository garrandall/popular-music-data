The sky was clear on that windy day
'Til the clear blue sky began to turn to grey
The lightning flashed, the thunder roared above
Then fell a drop of rain to start our love

Let the river get wide, the river gets long now
The water runs deep as our love gets strong now
So baby, don't you fight and say you belong now
To me

Upon the roof we heard the gentle rain
With the rhythm of our heartbeats down it came
As it hit each drop our hearts could feel the pain
No one on earth can stop a drop of rain

And the river get wide, the river gets long now
The water runs deep as our love gets strong now
So baby, don't you fight and say you belong now
To me

Let the river get wide, the river gets long now
The water runs deep as our love gets strong now
So baby, don't you fight and say you belong now
To me, yeah

Let the river get wide, the river gets long now
The water runs deep as our love gets strong now
So baby, don't you fight and say you belong now
To me
