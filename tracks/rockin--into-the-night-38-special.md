Cruisin down the motorway
Got my girl by my side
We're both a little anxious
Ooo, we got love on our mind
Waitin, anticipatin
For the fireworks in the night
Well I swear we were doin eighty
When we saw those motel lights


And we were rockin into the night
Rockin into the night
Ooo hoo rockin
Rockin into the night
Rockin into the night

Yeah, out on the back street
Taking love where I can
I found a sweet madonna
Ooo, with a bible in her hand
She's waiting, anticipating well
For someone to save her soul
Well I ain't no new messiah
But I'm close enough for rock and roll


And I'm slowin down
And she's pullin in 

Waitin, anticipatin
For the fireworks in the night
Well I swear we were doin eighty
When we saw those motel lights

We were rockin, rockin
Into the night
Ooo yeah
Rockin into the night
Rockin into the night
Hoo rockin
