V-Town, brother check it out, I'm bout to throw down
Dank in hand, the shit that has you toe down
A little city, chillin' in the North Bay
Needless to say, my boys don't play, fool
Yorker sidin', you know how the song goes
In the back, sippin' Purple Chongos
Don't look for trouble but it always seems to find us
Forty grippin', panty sippin', and it sneaks up right behind us
Quick left, one blow K.O
Hit the road to the next episode
In the saga of a few fellas
Oh what the hell, I guess I better tell ya
It's Friday night, I got a brand new kit on
A fifth of Heem, for me to get bent on
Hit the Country Club to pick up M-L
Eighty West, back to the hotel


At the telly, Vogues is doing pipe work
Johnny Z had his hand up a miniskirt
The latte in the corner started to flirt
And I knew that when she saw me baby doll was gonna jaw me
Set for the night so I took her to my ride
Grab my Mickey and my Buddha and I met her outside
Who-ride, rolling striking through to be seen
A Lexus 400 turnin' triple gold Zeens
Acid in my bottle, so I gotta get some more
Put the pedal to the metal back to the liquor store
'Cause you know what I mean when I'm feelin' kinda funky
A sick honky, straight goin' donkey
Money in my sock, jimmy in the glove
Layin in the Lexus, I'm about to make good love
And burn rubber up the block
Back to the telly, I gotta get some new cock
New cock (echoes)


Aw naw, could it be?
I just got a page and a broad wanna do me
Hooked it up, told her meet me at the hotel
She had a friend with her so I called TL
Swoop me up, Sally wanna meet Dick
And might lick, so try and make it real quick


(tick-tock)
(tick-tock)
(tick-tock)
(tick...Honk Honk)

Aw yeah, I jumped in the L-Train
But wait a minute, we gotta hit the store mayne
I got to get some gum and some Tic-Tacs
Two tall cans and a packet of Blackjacks
We got the goods, now we're headin' for the hoedown
There goes the telly, so fella won't you slow down
Park the ride in the front like a sick one
Just in case, we gotta bust a quick one
Lock the load, let's go look for like 118
But lay low cause I really don't wanna be seen
(Is this the room?) Aw yeah, that's the right one
I got the black broad and you got the white one
So hit the light man, I just might man
Try and throw this thing all night an'
Get her so sprung, that she'll drop some mail
So I can cut turf and hit another hotel
