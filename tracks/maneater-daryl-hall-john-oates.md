She'll only come out at nights
The lean and hungry type
Nothing is new
I've seen her here before
Watching and waiting
Oh she's sittin' with you
But her eyes are on the door

So many have paid to see
What you think
You're gettin' for free
The woman is wild
A she-cat tamed
By the purr of a Jaguar
Money's the matter
If you're in it for love
You ain't gonna get too far

(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Watch out boy
She'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
She's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Watch out boy
She'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
She's a maneater

I wouldn't if I were you
I know what she can do
She's deadly man
And she could really rip your world apart
Mind over matter
Oh the beauty is there
But a beast is in the heart

(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Watch out boy
She'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
She's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Watch out boy
She'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
She's a maneater



Oh
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Here she comes
Watch out boy
She'll chew you up
(Whoa-oh, here she comes
(Watch out) she's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
(She's a maneater)
Oh she'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Here she comes, she's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
(Watch out)
She'll only come out at night, ohoh
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Here she comes
She's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
(She's a maneater)
The woman is wild, whoooa
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Here she comes
Watch out boy, watch out boy
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Oh, watch out, watch out
Watch out, watch out
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
(Yeah, yeah) she's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
(She's a maneater)
She's watching and waiting, ohoh
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Oh, she's a maneater
