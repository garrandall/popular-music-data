I was born in New York City on a Monday
It seems I was out shinin' shoes 'bout Tuesday noon
All the bad cats, in the bad hats doing me a real big favor
The bad cats, in the bad hats playing it on real good

Here's a dime boy, give me a shine, boy

When the cold wind blows, it lives in New York City
The street's no place to be but there you are
So you try hard or you die hard, no one really gives a good damn
You try hard or you die hard, no one gives a damn

Here's a dime boy, give me a shine, boy
You're down and out in New York City

Ain't no place to be but where can you go?
Down and out, New York City
Never, never, never, never gonna get this way again

Gonna get myself together in the mornin'
Leave it all and one bad dream
All the bad cats, in the bad hats doing me a real big favor
The bad cats, in the bad hats, playing it on real good

Here's a dime boy, give me a shine, boy
Down and out in New York City

Ain't no place to be, where can you go?
When you're down and out, New York City
Oh, time I want you down, to go

Need a friend, where can you go?
Down and out, New York City
Never, never, never gonna get this way again
