Say brother, can I borrow a thin, brother
You know, a dime?
Say, say, say, sis
Sure would like to some dimes for me
So I can get this cup of coffee
Cop me a snack or something
I guess I better quit trying to be hip and get on down
Hey man, like, you know


I was born in New York City on a Monday
It seems I was out shining shoes by Tuesday noon
All the fat cats, in the bad hats doing me a real big favor
Got the fat cats, in the bad hats laying it on real good


"Here's a dime, boy. Give me a shine, boy."


When the cold wind comes, it lives at New York City
And the street's no place to be but there you are
So you try hard, or you die hard
No one really gives a good damn
You try hard, and you die hard
No one gives a damn


"Here's a dime boy. Give me a shine, boy."
Down and out in New York City
Ain't nowhere to be, but where can you go?
When you're down and out in New York City


I'm never, never, never gonna get that way again
No, no, no
No, no, not me
When you need a friend...
Need to have a
When you want a friend...


Going to get myself together until the morning
Going to leave it all like one bad dream
All the fat cats in the bad hats doing me a real big favor
Got the fat cats in the bad hats laying it on real good


"Here's a dime, boy. Give me a shine, boy
Give me a shine, boy."


Down and out, New York City
Ain't nowhere to be. Where can you go?
When you're down and out in New York City
Said I'm never never never gonna get that way again
No, no, no, no, not me
When you need a friend, troubled mind
When you need a friend, you got a troubled mind
Ain't nobody going to give you one thin dime
Friends can be cruel--sometimes can be sweet
But what, what bugs a man, what hurts a man
When you give him a drink
Just can't get nothing to eat
That's New York City

A Hundred and Twenty-Five Street
Bricks, Eighth Avenue
