There's a highway, a lonesome stretch of gray
It runs between us, and takes me far away
Out in the distance, always within reach
There's a crossroad, where all the victims meet
I close my eyes, and see her face
It's all I want to see
And deep inside, it still amazes me

Even now
She's all that I want
She's all that I need
Even now
She's givin' it all
She's givin' it free
Even now
When everything's right
When everything's wrong
Even now
She's keepin' me straight
She's keepin' me strong
She gets to me, somehow, Even now

And through the darkness, through all the endless days
Through all the changes, the pointless one act plays
I can still make it, I can still stand tall
Cause I've got my girl, to get me through it all
Through all the doubt, and all the fear
And all that I can't say, still somehow
She'll help me find my way

Even now
She's still in my heart
She's still in my soul
Even now
She's still on my mind
Wherever I go
Even now
Through all of my days
And all of my nights
Even now
She's keepin' it real
She's keepin' it right
She gets to me, somehow
Even now
Even now
Oh, even now
Even now
Ah
She's all that I want
She's all that I need
Even now
She's givin' it all
She's givin' it free
Oh Oh
When everything's right
When everything's wrong
Oh
She's keepin' it real
She's keepin' it strong
Oh, Oh
Even now
