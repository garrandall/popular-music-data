I walk down this old lonely street
No one seems to wanna speak
Oh, who cares, yes, who cares
For poor, poor me

(Who, who cares
Who, who cares)

All the world seem cold
Everything is gray
Nothing seems the same
Since you went away

Oh, who cares, yes, who cares
For me (who cares for me)

Surely happiness can be found
Surely someone for me
Must I go through life
With this hopeless love
Oh, why can't I be set free

All I want is you (who, who cares)
All I know is you (who, who cares)
But somehow our (who, who cares)
Love just can't be (who, who cares)

Oh, who cares, yes, who cares
For me (who cares for me)

Surely happiness can be found
Surely someone for me
Must I go through life
With this hopeless love
Oh, why can't I be set free

All I want is you (who, who cares)
All I know is you (who, who cares)
But somehow our (who, who cares)
Love just can't be (who, who cares)

Oh, who cares, yes, who cares
For me (who, who cares)

I'm gonna leave
(Who, who cares)
I'm gonna leave his town
(Who, who cares)

I'm going to the river
(Who, who cares)
Jump overboard and drown
(Who, who cares)

Whoa, oh
(Who, who cares)...
