Young teacher, the subject
Of schoolgirl fantasy
She wants him so badly
Knows what she wants to be
Inside her there's longing
This girl's an open page
Book marking, she's so close now
This girl is half his age


Don't stand so
Close to me
Don't stand so
Close to me


Her friends are so jealous
You know how bad girls get
Sometimes it's not so easy
To be the teacher's pet
Temptation, frustration
So bad it makes him cry
Wet bus stop, she's waiting
His car is warm and dry


Don't stand so
Close to me
Don't stand so
Close to me


Loose talk in the classroom
To hurt, they try and try
Strong words in the staffroom
The accusations fly
It's no use, he sees her
He starts to shake and starts to cough
Just like the old man in that
Famous book by Nabokov


Don't stand so
Close to me
Don't stand so
Close to me
