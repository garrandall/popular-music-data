Hey, yo, Mase, you know what I don't like?
(Why you over there lookin' at me?)
I don't like when, you know, I'm in a club
(Why you over there lookin' at me?)

And I'm with my honey
(Why you over there lookin' at me?)
You got, you know, the haters
They wanna be tough guys all of the sudden

Hit you with the ice grill, you know
'Cause you boys ain't with you
Little do they know, your girl roll harder than
Some of yo' niggas, dig?

Now, what the hell is you lookin' for?
Can't a young man get money anymore?
Let my pants sag down to the floor
Really do it matter as long as I score?

Can't my car look better than yours?
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to see me without no drawers
In a stretch Lex with about ten doors?

How is murder? P. Diddy name me pretty
Did it for the money, now, can you get with me?
People wanna know who is he, he get busy
Spray so much izzy, girls get dizzy

Niggas on the block know Mase motto
One thing about Harlem World, we all got dough
98' Tahoe, Tommy and a Roscoe
Case I'm every chased by a Donny Brascoe

Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?
Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?

Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?
Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?

Yo, I can't get mad 'cuz you look at me
'Cuz on the real, look at me
Yo, it always be the haters that be sittin' in the rear
Dissin' every gear but they better listen here

You cats keepin' it real, you cats is on yo' own
'Cuz bein' broke and alone is something I can't condone
Plus, it won't be long till they send me the dome
Sit gently, while I'm on the Bentley phone

Why you don't like me? 'Cuz I'm mad fly and icy?
And why you can't satisfy yo' wifey
And if it wasn't for this Bad Boy exposure
CD, TV's, really, would I know ya?

Now, me and blink float in the gold Rover
So, it's only right you get the cold shoulder
And if you got a girl, don't be real committed
'Cuz Mase will hit it, you got to deal with it

Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?
Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?

Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?
Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?

Make it hot, baby, make it hot
Make it hot, baby, make it hot
Make it hot, baby, make it hot
Make it hot, baby, make it hot
Make it hot

We was all at the Greek fest, it's hot and sandy
I rent scooters, I'm with my family
Tank top, flip flop, really nothing fancy
But get approached by a girl named Tammy

Who looked good enough to be Miss Miami
But say, since some her peeps call her Candy
Than she starts to ask about Aaliyah and Brandy
Tellin' me how she met Puff down at the Grammy's

He ain't tell you I was the one with no panties?
Boo, you know how many he meet with no panties?
Please, tell me something that I don't know
Like, if we have sex, you don't want dough

And if it's not a problem, you can meet me at 10
I'll be in room 112 and bring four friends
And if you gon' hit me, it gotta be a quickie
And please no hickies 'cuz wifey's with me

Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?
Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?

Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?
Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?

Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?
Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?

Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?
Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here?
