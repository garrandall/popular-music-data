"No. Thank you." is what I should've said,
I should be in bed
But temptations of trouble on my tongue,
Troubles yet to come

One sip, bad for me
One hit, bad for me
One kiss, bad for me
But I give in so easily
And "No. Thank you." is how it should've gone
I should stay strong

But I'm weak. And what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak. And what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak

But I'm weak. And what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
(Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that)

"No. Thank you."
They call me after dark,
I don't want no part
My habits,
They hold me like a grudge
I promise I won't budge

One sip, bad for me
One hit, bad for me
One kiss, bad for me
But I give in so easily
And "No. Thank you." is how it should've gone
I should stay strong

But I'm weak. And what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak. And what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak

But I'm weak. And what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that

We, we fall for that
Wake up, we fall again
We, we fall for that
Can't wait to fall again

One sip, bad for me
One hit, bad for me
One kiss, bad for me
But I give in so easily
And "No. Thank you." is how it should've gone
I should stay strong

But I'm weak. And what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak. And what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
Go!

But I'm weak. And what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
