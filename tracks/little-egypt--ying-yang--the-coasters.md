(Gonna find her)
(Gonna find her)
(Gonna find her)
(Gonna find her)
Yeah, I've been searchin'
A-a searchin'
Oh, yeah, searchin' every which a-way
Yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, searchin'
I'm searchin'
Searchin' every which a-way
Yeah, yeah
But I'm like the Northwest Mounties
You know I'll bring her in someday
(Gonna find her)
(Gonna find her)
Well, now, if I have to swim a river
You know I will
And a if I have to climb a mountain
You know I will
And a if she's a hiding up
On a blueberry hill
Am I gonna find her, child
You know I will
'Cause I've been searchin'
Oh, yeah, searchin'
My goodness, searchin' every which a-way
Yeah, yeah
But I'm like the Northwest Mounties
You know I'll bring her in some day
(Gonna find her)
(Gonna find her)
Well, Sherlock Holmes
Sam Spade got nothin', child, on me
Sergeant Friday, Charlie Chan
And Boston Blackie
No matter where she's a hiding
She's gonna hear me a comin'
Gonna walk right down that street
Like Bulldog Drummond
'Cause I've been searchin'
Oooh, Lord, searchin', mm child
Searchin' every which a-way
Yeah, yeah
But I'm like the Northwest Mounties
You know I'll bring her in some day
(Gonna find her)
(Gonna find her)
