Why did you say goodbye to me
Now I'm as lonely as could be
And as I feel a teardrop fall
I hear your footsteps down the hall
Walkin' away from me

Why did you say goodbye
Why did you make me cry
Now, every day I wonder why
Why, oh why, oh why, oh

Footsteps, footsteps
Footsteps, footsteps

You're such a haunting memory
I pray that you'll come back to me
But as I say my evening prayers
I hear your footsteps on the stairs
Walkin' away from me

Why did you say goodbye
Why did you make me cry
Now, every day I wonder why
Why, oh why, oh why, oh

Footsteps, footsteps
Footsteps, footsteps
Footsteps, footsteps
Footsteps
