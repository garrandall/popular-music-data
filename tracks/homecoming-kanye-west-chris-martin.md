And you say Chi city, Chi city, Chi city


I'm coming home again.
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
I'm in home again.


I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said, "Excuse me little homie,
I know you don't know me,
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees,"
And from that point I never blow her off,
Niggas come from outta town I like to show her off,
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off,
And make 'em straighten up their hat, 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
And at nighttime her face lit up so astounding
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never mess with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, "It felt like they walked and drove on me."
Knew I was gang-affiliated got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, "'Ye keep making that, keep making that platinum and gold for me!"


I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
I'm in home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Oh, now I'm coming home again
Maybe we can start again


But if you really cared for her,
Then you wouldn't never hit the airport
To follow your dream,
Sometimes I still talk to her,
But when I talk to her it always seems
Like she talking about me,
She said, "You left your kids and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you,
But they just not you," and I just got through
Talking 'bout what niggas tryna do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that when I was back home
Every interview I'm representing you making you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around,
If you don't know by now, I'm talking about Chi Town,


I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
I'm in home again
Maybe, do you remember when fireworks at lake Michigan
Oh, now I'm coming home again
I'm in home again
Maybe, do you remember when fireworks at lake Michigan
Oh, now I'm coming home again
Maybe we can start again

Coming home again
Coming home again
Maybe we can start again
