Hands off the man
Flim  flam  man
His mind is up his sleeve
And his talk is make believe
Oh Lord, the man's a fraud
He's the flim flam man
He's so cagey
He's a flim flam man
Hands off the man
Flim  flam man
He's the One In  the Trojan Horse Making
Making out like he's Santa Claus
Oh Lord, the man's a fraud
He's a flim flam  man
He's a fox
He's a flim flam man
Everybody wants him
The people and the police
And all the pretty ladies disarmed
Oh, oh, yeah, the beautiful gent
You know he has hardly a cent
He pays his monthly rent...
With the daily charm
Hands off the man
Flim flam man
His mind is  up his sleeve
And  his talk is make believe
Oh, Lord, the man's a fraud
He's a flim flam man
He's an artist
He's a flim flam man
He's so cagey
He's a flim flam men
He's a fox
She's a fool
Flim  flam  man.
Oh, don't worry
He's dishonest, so don't believe in him
He's a flim flam man...
