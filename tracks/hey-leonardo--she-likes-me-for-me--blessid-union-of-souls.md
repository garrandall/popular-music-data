She don't care about my car 
She don't care about my money 
And that's real good because I don't got alot to spend 
But if I did it wouldn't mean nothin' 

She likes me for me 
Not because I look like Tyson Beckford 
With the charm of Robert Redford 
Oozing out my ears 
But what she sees 
Are my faults and indecisions 
My insecure conditions 
And the tears upon the pillow that I shed 

She don't care about my big screen 
Or my collection of DVD's 
Things like that just never mattered much to her 
Plus she don't watch to much t.v. 

And she don't care that I can fly her 
To places she ain't never been 
But if she really wants to go 
I think deep down she knows that 
All she has to say is when 

She likes me for me 
Not because I hang with Leonardo 
Or that guy who played in "Fargo" 
I think his name is Steve 
She's the one for me 
And I just can't live without her 
My arms belong around her 
And I'm so glad I found her once again 

And I'm so glad I found her once again 
And I'm so glad I found her once again 
Gazing at the ceiling 
as we entertain our feelings in the dark 
The things that we're afraid of are gonna show us 
what we're made of in the end 

She likes me for me 
Not because I sing like Pavarotti 
Or because I am such a hottie 
I like her for her 
Not because she's phat like Cindy Crawford 
She has got so much to offer 
Why does she waste all her time with me 
There must be something there that I don't see 

She likes me for me 
Not because I'm tough like Dirty Hairy 
Make her laugh just like Jim Carrey 
Unlike the Cable Guy 
But what she sees 
Is that I can't live without her 
My arms belong around her 
And I'm so glad I found her once again 
Found her once again 
I'm so glad I found her once again 
On again
