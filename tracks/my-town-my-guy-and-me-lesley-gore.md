Don't tell me about towns like New York, Frisco
I'm not interested in all that small talk, go-go
I'm more satisfied being here by my baby's side
Just give me my town, my guy and me
My town, my guy and me

My town's got all the other town's beat
My town town's got everything that I need
Just give me my town, my guy and me

Don't tell me about all the good times I'm missin'
Nothing's good as the time when we're lovin', and kissin'
I'm happy right here, yeah, where every night
He holds me tight
Just give me my town, my guy and me
My town, my guy and me

My town's got what no other town's got
A guy that loves me and needs me a lot
So give me my town, my guy and me
My town, my guy and me

Oh, I'm happy right here, where every night
He holds me tight
Just give me my town, my guy and me
My town, my guy and me
Just give me my town, my guy and me
My town, my guy and me
So give me my town, my guy and me
