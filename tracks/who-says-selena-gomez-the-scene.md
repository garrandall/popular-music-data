I wouldn't wanna be anybody else, hey

You made me insecure
Told me I wasn't good enough
But who are you to judge?
When you're a diamond in the rough

I'm sure you got some things
You'd like to change about yourself
But when it comes to me
I wouldn't want to be anybody else

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na

I'm no beauty queen
I'm just beautiful me

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na

You've got every right
To a beautiful life
Come on

Who says, who says you're not perfect?
Who says you're not worth it?
Who says you're the only one that's hurting?

Trust me, that's the price of beauty
Who says you're not pretty?
Who says you're not beautiful?
Who says?

It's such a funny thing
How nothing's funny when it's you
You tell 'em what you mean
But they keep whiting out the truth

It's like a work of art
That never gets to see the light
Keep you beneath the stars
Won't let you touch the sky

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na

I'm no beauty queen
I'm just beautiful me

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na

You've got every right
To a beautiful life
Come on

Who says, who says you're not perfect?
Who says you're not worth it?
Who says you're the only one that's hurting?

Trust me, that's the price of beauty
Who says you're not pretty?
Who says you're not beautiful?
Who says?

Who says you're not start potential?
Who says you're not presidential?
Who says you can't be in movies?
Listen to me, listen to me

Who says you don't pass the test?
Who says you can't be the best?
Who said, who said?
Won't you tell me who said that?
Yeah, who said?

Who says, who says you're not perfect?
Who says you're not worth it? (Yeah)
Who says you're the only one that's hurtin' (Yeah, yeah)

Trust me, that's the price of beauty (Oh, hey, yeah)
Who says you're not pretty? (Beauty)
Who says you're not beautiful? (Who said? I'm just beautiful me)

Who says?
Who says you're not perfect?
Who says you're not worth it?
Who says you're the only one that's hurting?

Trust me, that's the price of beauty
Who says you're not pretty? (Who says you're not beautiful?)
Who says you're not beautiful?
Who says?
