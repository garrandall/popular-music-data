You had me to get her
And here, I thought it was me
I was changin', arrangin' my life to fit your lies
It's all said and all done
I gave it all for the long run
Can she say the same thing?
I guess this is goodbye and good luck
(I can't be what you want me to be)

I'm sorry for changing
I'm sorry it had to be this way
Believe me, it's easier just to pretend
But, I won't apologize for who I am

No, no

Remember the time when you said you were out with your best friend
But it wasn't the best friend that you knew I thought you meant and
I used to accept it, I didn't know I could be free
But I am, and I won't go back 'cause you so don't deserve me
(I don't even want to be her)

I'm sorry for changing
I'm sorry it had to be this way
Believe me, it's easier just to pretend
But, I won't apologize for who I am

I thank you for this hopeless war
Cause through the pain I found I'm stronger than before
And I want more
I don't need you anymore
Sorry
(Listen close I won't say this again)

I'm sorry for changing
I'm sorry it had to be this way
Believe me, it's easier just to pretend
But, I won't apologize for who I am

I'm sorry for changing
I'm sorry it isn't like it was
Believe me, it's easier just to pretend
But, I won't apologize
Why should I apologize
No, I won't apologize for who I am
