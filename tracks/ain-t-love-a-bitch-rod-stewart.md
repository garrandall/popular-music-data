Been in pain and I've been in shame
But ain't love a bitch
I been in fights, locked away for nights
But ain't love a bitch
I been tailed, impaled, strung up
And nailed and left without a stitch
I been scratched and taxed and finally axed
But ain't love a bitch


Oh, I didn't understand 'til I was 17
She took me way upstairs and she wiped me clean
Oh, I didn't realise she made a first class fool out of me
Oh Maggie, if you're still out there the rest is history


You're all alone in the freezing cold
By the underground
Your hands are numb and you're feeling dumb
'Cause you been let down
You thought you were rough and kinda tough
And maybe out of reach
You're acting chic, playing hide and seek
But ain't love a bitch


Oh, I must state right here I been there before
My eyes were closed and so my friends
I still don't know the score
Oh, don't underestimate the strength of it
It may be unwise to analyse even the cause of it


You're driving home late one night and on the radio
Comes an old familiar song you used to know so well (You know a lot about that)
Oh, I can't comprehend this thing called love
Maybe it's a matter of fact I just can't grow up
Deep down ain't we all a little juvenile
All I really wanna know is there one sweet angel
That can make me smile
Ain't love a bitch


Torrential rains, wars and hurricanes
I wouldn't budge an inch
Your rent's unpaid and your team lose again
But ain't love a bitch
You can lose your job, your home and your health
But ain't love a bitch
Take it or leave it some day you'll feel it
'Cause love is the bitch


Ain't love the bitch, ain't love a bitch
Ain't love a bitch, ain't love a bitch
Ain't love a bitch
