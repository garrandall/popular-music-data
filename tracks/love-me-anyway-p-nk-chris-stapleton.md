Even if you see my scars,
Even if I break your heart,
If we're a million miles apart,
Do you think you'd walk away?

Are you lost in all the noise?
Even if I lose my voice,
Flirt with all the other boys,
What would you say?

Could you?
Could you?
Could you love me anyway?

Is it for better or for worse,
Or am I just your good-time girl?
Can you still hold me when it hurts,
Or would you walk away?

Even if I scandalize you,
Cut you down and criticize you,
Tell a million lies about you,
What would you say?

Could you? (You)
Could you? (You)
Could you? (You)
Could you love me anyway?

Could you? (Ah, could you?)
Could you? (Could you?)
Could you?
Could you love me anyway?

Could you?

Could you? (Could you still love me?)
Could you? (Pick up the pieces of me?)
Could you? (Could you still love me?)
Could you love me anyway?

Could you? (Could you still love me?)
Could you? (Pick up the pieces of me?)
Could you? (Could you still love me?)
Could you love me anyway?

Could you? (Will you catch me when I fall?)
Could you? (And we rise above it all)
Could you? (Will you hold me when it hurts?)
Like it's the end of the world?
Could you? Could you? Could you? Could you?
