Well, there was no reason to believe she'd always be there
But if you don't put faith in what you believe in
It's getting you nowhere
Cos it hurts, you never let go
Don't look down, just look up
Cos she's always there to behind you, just to remind you

Two hearts, believing in just one mind
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind

Cos there's no easy way to, to understand it
There's so much of my life in her, and it's like I'm blinded
And it teaches you to never let go
There's so much love you'll never know
She can reach you no matter how far
Wherever you are

Two hearts, believing in just one mind
Beating together till the end of time
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
Together forever till the end of time

She knows (she knows)
There'll always be a special place in my heart for her
She knows, she knows, she knows
Yeah, she knows (she knows)
No matter how far apart we are
She knows, I'm always right there beside her

We're two hearts...
