Now there's a place right across town
Whenever you're ready
Where the people gather 'round
Whenever they're ready
And then the music begins to play
You feel a groove comin' on its way

Are you ready?
Yes I'm ready
You get yours
I got mine
For the monkey time
Monkey time

Now this dance that the people do
Don't know how it started
All I know is when the beat brings the feel
It's hard to get parted
And then the music begins to play
And automatically you're on your way

Are you ready?
Yes I'm ready
You get yours
I got mine
For the monkey time
Monkey time

Do the monkey yeah
Do the monkey yeah
Do the monkey yeah, yeah
Do the monkey yeah, yeah

Twist them hips
Let your backbone slip
Now move your feet
Get on the beat

Are you ready?
Yes I'm ready
Are you ready?
Yes I'm ready
You get yours
I got mine
For the monkey time
Monkey time

Are you ready?
Yes I'm ready
Are you ready?
Yes I'm ready
Are you ready?
Yes I'm ready
You get yours
I got mine


Say Fee
Are you ready tonight?
I'm ready, Martha
But you're ready for what, Fee?
I'm ready to do the monkey, baby
You ready for my monkey?
I'm ready, and my monkey's ready
Your monkey
Oooo, you'd better put that baby on a chain
My monkey know what he talkin' about
And he's gonna jump all over you
Now stop it, Fee
I don't wanna hear about it no more

Want a whole lot o' love tonight
Treat your monkey right
Want a whole lot o' love tonight
Monkey time tonight

Want a whole lot o' love tonight
Treat your monkey right
Want a whole lot o' love tonight
Monkey time tonight

Want a whole lot o' love tonight
