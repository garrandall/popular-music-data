Knock, knock, knock, knock
Knock, knock, knock, knock

Crazy little mama come knocking
Knocking at my front door
Crazy little mama come knocking
Knocking at my front door

Crazy little mama come
Knock, knock, knocking
Just like she did before

If you got a little mama
And you want to keep her neat
Keep your mama off my street

Same thing will happen
Like it did before
She'll come knock, knock
Knocking at my door

Crazy little mama come
Knock, knocking
Just like she did before

If you got a little mama
And you want to keep her neat
Keep your mama off my street

Same thing will happen
Like it did before
She'll come knock, knock
Knocking at my door

Crazy little mama come knocking
Knocking at my front door

Oh, oh, she come knocking
That crazy little mama
She comes back knocking
Knocking at my front door

If you got a little mama
And you want to keep her neat
Keep your mama off my street

Same thing will happen
Like it did before
She'll come knock, knock
Knocking at my door

Crazy little mama come knocking
Knocking at my back door

If you got a little mama
And you want to keep her neat
Keep your mama off my street

Same thing will happen
Like it did before
She'll come knock, knock
Knocking at my door

Crazy little mama come knocking
Knocking at my front door
