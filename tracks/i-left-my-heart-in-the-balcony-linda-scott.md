(spoken)
They said he was a talent scout
In a big, long, fancy car
He came through town, took my baby away
Said he'd make him a star

(sing)
He took him off to Hollywood
And not once did he write
I saw his name on a marquee sign
I went to see his picture last night
And I left my heart in the balcony
Last row, third seat
I couldn't take it anymore
So I left my heart in the balcony
And my teardrops on the floor

On a wide, wide screen in Cinemascope
And Technicolor too
Some good lookin' girl was kissin' his lips
The lips that I once knew
And I left my heart in the balcony
Last row, third seat
I couldn't take it anymore
So I left my heart in the balcony
And my teardrops on the floor

Well, he's a star now and he's gone for good
Livin' in a mansion in Hollywood
That movie queen, she stole my guy
Whe I pass the theatre I have to cry
'Cause I left my heart in the balcony
Last row, third seat
I couldn't take it anymore
So I left my heart in the balcony
And my teardrops on the floor
(oh-oh)
