Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't wanna leave her now Lord you know I believe and how


Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't wanna leave her now you know I believe and how


You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know I don't know
You stick around now it may show
I don't know I don't know


I don't wanna leave her now you know I believe and how


You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know I don't know
You stick around now it may show
I don't know I don't know


Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't wanna leave her now Lord you know I believe and how
