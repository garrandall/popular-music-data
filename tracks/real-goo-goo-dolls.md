Everyone's angry, no, everyone's scared
And you can't choose a side 'cause you don't really care
How does it feel to be free when you feel nothing?

You got five hundred channels distracting your brain
Benzos and wine to numb out the pain
Why should you feel anything?
It's all so boring

Oh, all we need is
Something real to believe in
Oh, all we need is
Something real to believe in

Putting the pill on the tip of your tongue
'Cause you're trying to be free or you're trying to be young
Someday the summer ends and then you're over

Are we stupid or brave?
Do you think we can save what's left of the American dream?
They say we didn't pay to hear opinions
So why don't you shut up and sing?

Oh, all we need is
Something real to believe in
Oh, all we need is
Something real to believe in

Dreamin' of a perfect day
The kind that don't exist here anyway
But I can still dream
It's still legal to resist
At least I think it is
Long as my eyes are closed
As long as my eyes are closed
As long as my eyes are closed
As long as my eyes are closed
As long as my eyes are closed
As long as my eyes are closed
As long as my eyes are closed
As long as my eyes are closed
As long as my eyes are closed

Oh, all we need is
Something real to believe in
Oh, all we need is
Something real to believe in
