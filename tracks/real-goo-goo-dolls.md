Hey, anybody in this world?
Can you talk to me a while?
Find a reason for it all?
Cause I've been thinking backwards
To a place I've never been
To a home that never was
It's like I'm losing it again
And it takes so long to say these words
Can you wait that long for me?


Hey, nothing is real, it's all what you believe
Something you dream inside your head
You know how I feel because it's just you and me
Something I need to call my own
To feel and call my own


Duck inside this empty room
And I'm waiting for the sun to come to me
Someday, I'm gonna get this right
Gonna find a better way, I wanna lead another life
I wanted to let you know me
But I'm trapped inside the fear
And I never said a word though you always seemed to hear
When I take so long to say these words
Yeah, you wait so long for me
