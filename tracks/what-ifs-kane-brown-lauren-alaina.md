You say what if I hurt you, what if I leave you
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?
What if this goes south, what if I mess you up?
You say what if I break your heart in two, then what?


Well I hear you girl, I feel you girl, but not so fast
Before you make your mind up, I gotta ask


What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?


What if the sky falls (Sky falls)
Or the sun stops burnin'?
We could worry about them what ifs 'til the world stops turnin'
Or I could kiss you (You should kiss me)
What if you liked it? (Bet I'd like it)
Well we ain't never gonna know unless we try it


What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?
Awe yeah
C'mon


You say what if I hurt you, what if I leave you?
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?
Damn


What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?


Away (Away)
What if?
