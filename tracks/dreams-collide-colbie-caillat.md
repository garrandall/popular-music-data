I am stuck here in a moment
And I'm trying to pretend
So I'll play this feeling over and over again
I owned alone this memory
Maybe I should awake instead
But I'm on my way to go back inside my head


I close my eyes and try to hide
But wake when these dreams collide


So Iâ€™ll put this on repeat
And I'll make up what comes next
Now I lay here daydreaming on your chest


I close my eyes and try to hide
But wake when these dreams collide


But it all breaks down
If I keep on wasting all my time
All alone in my head
Wish I never thought about it in the end


I close my eyes and try to hide
But wake when these dreams collide
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
