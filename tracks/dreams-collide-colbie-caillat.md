I am stuck here in a moment
And I'm trying to pretend
So I'll play this feeling over and over again

I owned alone this memory
Maybe I should awake instead
But I'm on my way to go back inside my head

I close my eyes
And try to hide
But wake
When these dreams collide

So Iâll put these all on repeat
And I'll make up what comes next
Now I lay here day dreaming on your chest

When I'm staling to open my eyes
Cause I know it's time for me to leave this bed
But I've decided to fall back inside my head

I close my eyes
And try to hide
But wait
When these dreams collide

Wait all breaks down

If I keep on wasting all my time
All alone in my head
Wish I never thought about it in the end

I close my eyes
And try to hide
But wait
When these dreams collide
