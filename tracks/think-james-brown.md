About the good thing
About the bad thing
About the right thing
About the wrong thing
But lady before you leave me, realize that I'm the one who loves you

Think about the sacrifices that I made for you
Think about the hard time that I spent for you
Think about the good things that I done for you
Think about the bad things I tried not to do
Come on children yeah

About the good thing
About the bad thing
About the right thing
About the wrong thing
But lady before you leave me, realize that I'm the one who loves you

About the good thing
About the bad thing
About the right thing
About the wrong thing
But lady before you leave me, realize that I'm the one who loves you

How much of all your hapinesss can I really claim
How many years have you shed for which I am to blame
Doll, I can't remember just what it brought
I tried so hard to please you, at least that's what I thought

Come on children

About the good thing
About the bad thing
About the right thing
About the wrong thing
But lady before you leave me, realize that I'm the one who loves you
