I don't need whole lots 'a money
I don't need a big, fine car
I got everything that a man could want
I got more than I could ask for

See, I don't have to run around
I don't have to stay out all night
'Cause I got a sweet, a sweet lovin' woman
And she knows just how to treat me right

My baby, she's all right
My baby, clean out of sight, don't you know that
She's

She's some kind 'a wonderful Yes she is
She's some kind 'a wonderful
Now let me tell you one thing

When she holds me in her arms
She sets my soul on fire
Oh when my baby kisses me
It fills my heart with desire
And when she wraps her lovin' arms around me
Always tires me out of my mind
I feel a funny little feeling inside of me
Chills run up and down my spine

My baby, she's all right
My baby, clean out of sight, don't you know that
She's

She's some kind 'a wonderful, Yes she is
She's some kind 'a wonderful

Now is there anybody
Got a sweet little woman like mine
Got to be somebody
With a sweet little woman like mine

Can I get a witness
Can I get a witness
Can I get a witness
