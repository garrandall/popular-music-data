Wynken and Blynken and Nod
One night sailed off in a wooden shoe
Sailed in a river
Of crystal light into a sea of dew

Now where are you going?
And what do you wish?
The old moon asked of the three
Well, we're going out fishing
For herring fish
That live in the beautiful sea

Nets of silver
And gold have we said
Wynken and Blynken and Nod

The old moon laughed
And sang a song
As they rocked in their wooden shoe
And the wind that sped them
All night long ruffled the waves of dew

Well the little stars were the herring fish
That lived in the beautiful sea
Now cast your nets
Wherever you wish
Never as feared are we
So sang the stars
To the fisherman three
Wynken and Blynken and Nod

All night long
Their nets they threw
To the stars and the twinkling foam
Then down from the skies came
The wooden shoe bringing the fisherman home

Twas all so pretty a sight
It seemed as if it could not be
And some folks thought it was
A dream they dreamed
Of sailing the beautiful sea
But I shall name you
The fisherman three
Wynken, Blynken and Nod

Now Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes
And Nod is a little head
And the wooden shoe
That sailed the sky
Is a wee one's trundle bed

So close your eyes
While mother sings
Of the beautiful sights that be
And you will see wonderful things
As you rock on the misty sea
Where the old moon rocks
The fisherman three
Wynken and Blynken and Nod
