Now when I was a young girl
My dad warned me about the opposite sex
He'd say, yeah, that's just what you need
Some crazy boy with wild ideas
You know what always happens next

I tried to heed his advice
Now I'm thinkin' it sounds kinda nice

It's just what I need on a night like this
A long walk in the dark, someone I can't resist
A little rendezvous, a little mystery
When I look at you I think that's just what I need

Now my momma told me in this dog-eat-dog world
You gotta work harder than a man
She'd say, yeah that's just what you need
Some romance book Romeo callin' you at work and messin' up your plans

Night falls, I slow down
I start dreamin' of you comin' around

It's just what I need on a night like this
A long walk in the dark, someone I can't resist
A little rendezvous, a little mystery
When I look at you I think that's just what I need

Moonlight, sweet bliss
Melting with every kiss
Dancin' real slow
When you hold me close I know

It's just what I need on a night like this
A long walk in the dark, someone I can't resist
A little rendezvous, a little mystery
When I look at you I think that's just what I need

Just what I need
Just what I need
Oh yeah
