I remember the way, you used to love me
I remember the days, you used to love me


You don't appreciate the time
I put into this love affair of ours, baby
I couldn't let you walk around
Thinking it's alright to let me down


(I remember)
I remember (the way) the way you used to love me
(Baby, I remember the way)
I remember the days you used to love me
(oh, you used to love me)


I gave you all my precious love
And anything you wanted from me
You didn't hear me calling out
Calling for your warm affection after all this time


You can't deny what I'm feeling is real
And I stood around, stood by your side
Went through all the hurt and pain
And you turned and walked away


I remember (I remember) the way you used (you used to love me) to love me
(Baby)
I remember the days you used to love me
(oh, remember)


Yeah yeah, oh
Can't give up on the way you used to give it to me
Give it to me
What a feeling, it's so real


(I remember)
I remember (I remember) the way you used to love me
(Baby, you use to love me)
I remember the days you used to love me


You didn't hear me calling out
And that's not what love's about (no no)
I remember you used to love me
You used to love me every day (every day, every day)
Now your love has gone away
I remember, I remember


(Baby, I remember)
I remember (I remember) the way you used to love me
(You used to love me every day)
I remember (do you remember, I remember) the days you used to love me
Oh, I remember the way you used to love me
(Oh baby, you used to walk holding my hand
'Cause you used to be my man, I remember)
I remember the days you used to love me
(Didn't hear me calling out
And that's not what love's about, I remember)
I remember the way you used to love me
(Baby, you used to love me)
I remember the days (I said I remember) you used to love me
