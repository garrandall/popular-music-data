And here's to you
Mrs. Robinson,
Jesus loves you more than you will know,
Woah woah woah,
God bless you please
Mrs. Robinson,
Heaven holds a place for those who pray,
Hey hey hey

We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files,
We'd like to help you to learn to help yourself,
Look around you all you see are sympathetic eyes
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home,

And here's to you
Mrs. Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know
Woah woah woah,
God bless you please
Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
Hey hey hey

Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes,
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes,
It's a little secret just the Robinsons' affair,
Most of all you got to hide it from the kids and coo coo cachoo

Mrs. Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know
Woah woah woah
God bless you please
Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
Hey hey hey

Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon
Going to the candidates debate
Laugh about it shout about when you got to choose
Every way you look at it you lose
Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio
our nation turns its lonely eyes to you?
Woo woo woo,
What's that you say Mrs. Robinson?
Joltin' Joe has left and gone away
Hey hey hey.
