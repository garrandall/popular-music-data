If you wanted that star that shines so brightly
To match the star dust in your eyes
Darlin', I would chase that bright star nightly
And try to steal it from the skies

'cause I would give sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
Your perfect kiss thrills me so
Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
I'll never ever let you go

And if you needed a dream to keep you smiling
I'll tell the sandman you were blue
And I'd ask him to keep that sand a-piling
Till your dreams would come true

'cause I would give sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
Your perfect kiss thrills me so
Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey
I'll never ever let you go

If you wanted a love to last forever
Then I would send my love your way
And my love would only last forever
But forever and a day
