Watching every motion
In my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean
Finally lovers know no shame
Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn around and say
My love

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watching I keep waiting
Still anticipating love
Never hesitating
To become the fated ones
Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn around and say
My love

Take my breath away 
Take my breath away

Through the hourglass I saw you
In time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you
And turned to hear you say
If only for today
I am unafraid

Take my breath away 
Take my breath away

Watching every motion
In this foolish lovers game 
Haunted by the notion
Somewhere there's a love in flames
Turning and returning 
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn around and say
My love

Take my breath away
Take my breath away
