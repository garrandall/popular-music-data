You're followin' me
Wherever I go
You'll always be there –
So, what do I care?
You're followin' me!

When I've got the time
I'll slip you a kiss
I'll keep you around
You'll always be found –
You're followin' me!

That's what I thought
(Do wah, do wah!)
That's what I said right along
(Do wah, do wah!)
But now it appears with time an' tears
Have proved that I was wrong!

You're followin' me!
(Gi, gi!)
But, not like before
(Gi, gi!)
Tho' we're far apart
(Bah!)
You're stealin' my heart –
(Bah!)
You're followin' me!
(You're followin' me!)

Come back baby!
(Sha na na na!)
I'll treat you right this time!
(Sha na na na!)
Come back baby!
(Sha na na na!)
I promise to change all my ways!

You're followin' me
(Gi, gi!)
But, not like before
(Gi, gi!)
Tho' we're far apart
(Bah!)
You're stealin' my heart –
(Bah!)
You're followin' me!
(You're followin' me!)
You're followin' me!
(You're followin' me!)
You're followin' me!
(You're followin' me!)

Ah! Come back baby!
(Sha na na na!)
I'll treat you right this time!
(Sha na na na!)
Come back baby!
(Sha na na na!)
I promise to change all my ways!

You're followin' me
(Gi, gi!)
But, not like before
(Gi, gi!)
Tho' we're far apart
(Bah!)
You're stealin' my heart –
(Bah!)
You're followin' me!
(You're followin' me!)
You're followin' me!
(You're followin' me!)
You're followin' meeeeee!
Yeah!
