Take a load off your mind
Ride the mighty glory
Listen to my story
Ride the mighty high

Take a load off your mind
Ride the mighty glory
Listen to my story
Ride the mighty high

Take a load off your feet
Hear what I'm saying
Hear what I'm saying
It will set your mind at ease

I was just a man
A lonely man indeed
God took all my troubles
Yes He did, He set me free

Take a load off your mind
Ride the mighty glory
Listen to my story
Ride the mighty high

Take a load off your mind
Ride the mighty glory
Listen to my story
Ride the mighty high

He led me to discover
The man that I could be
Let Him be your leader
He's so good He'll set you free

Listen to my story
Listen to my plea
Let Him be your leader
He will end your misery

Take a load off your mind
Ride the mighty glory
Listen to my story
Ride the mighty high

Take a load off your mind
Ride the mighty glory
Listen to my story
Ride the mighty high

Come on and ride the mighty high
Come on and ride the mighty high
Come on and ride the mighty high
Come on and ride the mighty high

Take a load off your mind
Ride the mighty glory
Listen to my story
Ride the mighty high

Take a load off your mind
Ride the mighty glory
Listen to my story
Ride the mighty high

Come on and ride the mighty high
Come on and ride the mighty high
Come on and ride the mighty high
Come on and ride the mighty high

Take a load off your mind
Ride the mighty glory
Listen to my story
Ride the mighty high

Take a load off your mind
Ride the mighty glory
Listen to my story
Ride the mighty high

Come on and ride the mighty high
Come on and ride the mighty high
Come on and ride the mighty high
Come on and ride the mighty high
