Blue lonely nights are all I seem to remember about her
Nobody told me about her
I deserve the right to put it all behind me and live me life
I'm gonna live it without her
It's easier said than done
I need someone sooner or later
I spend every night at home
So I put an add in the paper

Help Wanted
Members don't see this message
It's personal, won't you please help me
I got to shake this aching feeling
Or I could spend the rest of my life healing
Help Wanted
It's personal, won't you please help me
I can't do it all alone
So won't you call the listed phone below
And talk to me (talk to me)

I know some cold hearted people
If they knew, I'm sure they'd laugh at me
But I don't care much about it
For somebody new, who's not afraid to take a chance with me
Or we could take it or leave it
I don't care who you are, you'll need someone sooner or later
Then I've been cold before, but I think I'll change for the better

When I think of all the lonely people looking for someone
When I think of all the days and nights I thought I was the only one
