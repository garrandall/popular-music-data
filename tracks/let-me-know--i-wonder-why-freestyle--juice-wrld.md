Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know what's up with you, ooh
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know if you comfortable, ooh
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know what's up with you, ooh
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know if you comfortable, ooh

I found your vibe, and I- and I found my high, yeah
Let's touch the sky, Imma- Imma change your life, yeah
Do you realize I love the way you look me in my eyes, yeah
Don't kill my vibe, nigga, don't kill my vibe, yeah
On top of my game nigga we aren't the same, aye
I wonder why lame niggas think that they run things
I wonder why, I- I wonder why, yeah
Just feel the vibes, just- just feel the vibes, yeah

Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know what's up with you, ooh
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know if you comfortable, ooh
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know what's up with you, ooh
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know if you comfortable, ooh

Now when you left, left, it wasn't right, yeah
I took a left, swerve, then I took a right, yeah
I was feeling right, yeah
See it in the night air
They talking dumb, well frankly I don't care
You realize I'm the man and I'm in my prime, yeah
And it's my time, I swear to god I won't waste no time, yeah
You ain't worth a dime, no, you ain't worth a dime, yeah
Still on my mind, whoa, you're still on my mind, yeah

Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know what's up with you, ooh
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know if you comfortable, ooh
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know what's up with you, ooh
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know if you comfortable, ooh

I wonder why, I- I wonder why, yeah
Just feel the vibes, just- just feel the vibes
I wonder why, I- I wonder why, yeah
Just feel the vibes, just- just feel the vibes
I wonder why, I- I wonder why, yeah
Just feel the vibes, just- just feel the vibes
Just feel the vibes, just- just feel the vibes
