I know you're hurting right now 
Don't worry 
I'll be your superman (no, no) 

 
I can love you like no one can 
I can be your superman (superman) 
Just take my hand let's fly away 
I promise I'll be there everyday 
Just close your eyes let's start to fly 
I'm gonna love you until I die (till I die) 
Until the day of my death to my very last breath 
I'm gonna love you when no ones left 

Come fly with me baby 
Yeah I'm the one 
With the S on my chest 
Forget about your ex 
He don't know what love is 
He just failed the test 
Plus he don't treat you right 
He keeps you crying all night 
See, hes like your kryptonite 
I came to give you their strength 
So you can leave him behind 
You can start all over 
Just press rewind 
Cause he don't understand that you're one of a kind 
So sweet, so sexy and just so fine 
I will fight to my death just to make you mine 
I will never neglect you 
Never have time to stress you 
And always respect you 
Girl you like a hidden treasure 
And I promise to love you 
From now until forever 
OOO para siempra mija 
Te prometo Te voy amar 
Hasta la muerte 

 

I'm the type of guy 
That will stand by your side 
To wipe them tears when they fall from your eyes 
I'm the one you hold when your nights is cold 
The one that stays near to fight away your fears 
You aint gotta be scared 
See I put an end to your ex 
No more beating you up (nuh uh) 
Or pulling on your hair 
See I came to save the day 
A man like that should'nt treat you that way 
And I don't understand why'd you take that route? 
Look at yourself 
Your beautiful inside and out 
You need to drop that zero (uhh) 
Let me swoop you off your feet 
Cause I can be your superhero 
Do you follow my lead? 
I guarantee you baby 
I'm all that you need 
See, you can change your plans 
All you got to do is call on me and I can be your superman 

 
Will you be by my side for the rest of my life? 
For the rest of my life 
Will you love me till I die? 

 

 
No ones left 
Till no ones left 
Till no ones left 
Gonna love you 
Gonna love you 
My superman 
My superman
