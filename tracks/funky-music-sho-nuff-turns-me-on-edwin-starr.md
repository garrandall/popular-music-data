I like the sound of funky music
Let me hear you sing it
(I like the sound of funky music) I like it
'Cause funky music sho nuff turns me on

Bless my soul, I can't control
The feeling I get when I hear the funky music
People, it does something to my brain
What it is I can't explain
Keep it right there
I don't want to lose it
Keep it funky now

Come on, come on, come on people now
(Express yourself)
Come on, come on, come on people now

I like the sound of funky music
Funky music does something to my soul
Everybody sing it
(I like the sound of funky music) I like it
'Cause funky music sho nuff turn me on

Music's got my soul on fire
I can feel the blood boiling in my veins
People, I get a feeling deep down inside
Something like a rollercoaster ride
And I ain't ashamed to say that I feel alright
Keep it funky now

Come on, come on, come on, come on people and express yourself
Don't it make you feel alright
All you crazy people from the big city
Get on down to the nitty gritty

I like the sound of funky music
Everybody sing it with me
(I like the sound of funky music) I like it
'Cause funky music sho nuff turn me on

Boom boom boom
Like a river turns me
Boom boom boom
