He's a giver, he'll give her the kind
Of attention that she's never known
He's a helper, he'll help her to open
The doors that she can't on her own.

He's a lover and he'll love her in ways
That she's never been loved before
He's a getter, he'll get her by gettin' her
Into the world she's been hungerin' for.

He's a charmer, he'll charm her with money
And manners that I never learned
He's a leader, he'll lead her across
Pretty bridges he's plannin' to burn.

He's a talker, he'll talk her right off of her feet
But he won't talk for long
'Cause he's a doer, and he'll do her the way
That I'd never, damned if he won't do her wrong.

He's a taker, he'll take her to places
And make her fly higher than she's ever dared to
He'll take his time before takin' advantage
Takin' her easy and slow.

And after he's taken the body and soul
She gives him he'll take her for granted
Take off and leave her taken all of her
Pride when he goes.

He's a taker, he'll take her to places
And make her fly higher than she's ever dared to
He'll take his time before takin' advantage
Takin' her easy and slow
