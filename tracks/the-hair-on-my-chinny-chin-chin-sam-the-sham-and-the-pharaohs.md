Who's there? Howl, it's me again
I'll huff and puff and blow your little house down

You hid your heart in a house of bricks
And locked all the doors and windows
I've already used a whole bag of tricks
I can't find a way to get in though

You don't want to let a new love start
So you put a brick house around your heart
But I'm gonna keep hangin' around
Till I huff and puff and blow your little house down

Now let me back up and get me a good breath

I swear by the hair on my chinny chin chin
I'm gonna find a way to get in
I'm gonna keep hangin' around
Till I huff and puff and blow your little house down

Now, little Red Riding Hood, I know you're in there
Tell 'em little pig to open up the door

Your heart was broken once before
Now my heart can't get near you
I'd like to make up for his mistakes
But another love just scares you

You don't wanna let a new love start
So you put a brick house around your heart
But I'm gonna keep hangin' around
Till I huff and puff and blow your little house down

Now listen little pigs
I'm gonna let you off the hook if you open the door now

I swear by the hair on my chinny chin chin
I'm gonna find a way to get in
I'm gonna keep hangin' around
Till I huff and puff and blow your little house down

Awright I warned ya now
Oh me, if grandma hadn't run me so bad
I wouldn't be so outta air
Now, come on pigs open up this door
