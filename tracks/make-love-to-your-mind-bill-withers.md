I love the story in your love song
Buildin' them castles in your mind
You come down here lookin' for a feelin'
Someday I know you're gonna find
I wanna lay down now beside you
But first we ought to take some time
Before I make love to your body
I wanna make love to your mind

I wanna feel good just like you do
I haven't love in quite some time
I have some phases that I've been through
Where I've just loved and left behind
I'm just too tired of feeling guilty
I don't wanna be unkind
But before I make love to your body
I wanna make love to your mind
