I'll pack up all my things and walk away
I don't want to hear another word you have to say
I've been waiting for so long,
(So long)
I just found out there's something wrong,
(Something is wrong)
Nothing will get better if I stay

There's no need to explain anymore
I tried my best to love you,
Now I'm walkin' out the door
(Walking out the door)
You used me, you've deceived me,
(What you trying to do to me?)
And you never seem to need me
But I'll bet, you won't forget me when I go
(Oh no, no, no)

Seems I've been lost in a dream,
Pretending that you care
And now I've opened up my eyes,
And found it's all been just a great big fairytale
I've been lovin' you so long,
(My love's so strong)
Don't think I'll even know how to forget you
(I can't forget you)
But now the way that things have been,
I think I'm better off alone,
Than to be with you
You don't love me it's plain to see

You played around, you broke my heart,
Told me we would never part,
But that wasn't true,
So what else can I do but move on?

I've been loving you so long,
(My love's so strong)
Don't think I'll even know how to forget you
(I can't forget you)
But now the ways that things have been,
I think I'm better of alone,
Than to be with you
You don't love me it's plain to see

There's no need to explain anymore
I tried my best to love you,
Now I'm walkin' out the door
(Walking out the door)
Ah, you used me, you've deceived me,
(What you trying to do to me?)
And you never seem to need me
But I'll bet you won't forget me when I go
(Oh no, no, no)

Seems I've been lost in a dream,
Pretending you were mine
Someday you'll open up your eyes
And realize that a good woman's hard to find

Yes I've been lost in a dream
Pretending that you care
And now I've opened up my eyes
And found it's all been just a great big fairytale
(I'll move on)
Move on... got to move on
Move on... got to move on
Move on... got to move on
Move on
Hit it Nellie
I've got to move on
