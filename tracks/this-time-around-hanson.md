It's getting colder in this ditch where I lie 
I'm feeling older and I'm wondering why 
I heard they told her it was tell and live or die 
I didn't know her but I know why she lied 
I didn't know her but I know why she died 


You can't say I didn't give it 
I won't wait another minute 
We're on our way this time around 
You can't say I didn't give it 
I won't wait another minute 
We're on our way this time around 

And we won't go down 

I heard them say that dreams should stay in your head 
Well I feel ashamed of the things that I've said 
Put on these chains and you can live a free life 
Well I'd rather bleed just to know why I die 



And we won't go down 
And we won't go down 
And we won't go down 
And we won't go down 
All I know is that fear has got to go 
This time around 

I've started feeling like I don't want to fight 
Give in to the given and put out the light 
Cannons a blazing shower these moonlit skies 
Then I remember and I know why he died 
Do you know why I die 



And we won't go down 
And we won't go down 
And we won't go down
