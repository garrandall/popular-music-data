I will come to you each night
And hold you tight
Just to show I love you
Then, I'll call you every day
When I'm away
Just to show I love you

So many things
That I could say and do
So many ways
To prove my love is true

I will help you when you're sad
And make you glad
Just to show I love you
And remember all the time
That you are mine
And I'm thinking of you

Don't break these ties
Whatever we may do
I will tell you 'til I die
"My darling, I-I-I-I-I love you"

So many things
That I could say and do
I will tell you 'til I die
"My darling, I-I-I-I-I love you"
