Don't mess with my toot toot, don't mess with my toot toot, Well you can have the other woman, but don't mess with my toot toot.
She was born in her birth suit, the doctor slap her behind, (SLAP!) Say you're gonna to be special, you sweet little toot toot.
Well you can look as much, but if you much as touch, You're gonna have yourself a case - I'm gonna break your face!
Oh toot, hey!
Whoa, Mama was the same way too, all the fellas didn't know what to do, And Papa never had a chance, with a sweet little toot toot.
She was born in her birth suit, the doctor slap her behind, (SLAP!) Said you're gonna to be special, you sweet little toot toot.
