You told me that you would leave me here in tears
Now you're gone and hours seem like years
So darling, i sing my song
Your leaving makes my heart beat slow and slow
Now i'm wondering where did you go
Please tell me, tell me what is wrong
I still love you
Won't you please come back to me?
Come back where, where you ought to be
Don't stay away from me
Cause you'll always be my own
We'll be together for eternity
You told me that you would leave me here in tears
Now you're gone and hours seem like years
And you left me singing a song
I'm just singing a song
You left me singing a song...
