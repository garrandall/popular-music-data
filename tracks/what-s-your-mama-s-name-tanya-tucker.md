Thirty some odd years ago
A young man came to Memphis
Askin' 'bout a rose that used to blossom
In his world
People never took the time
to mind the young man's questions
Until one day they heard him ask
a little green eyed girl


What's your mama's name child
What's your mama's name
Does she ever talk about
A place called New Orleans
Has she ever mentioned
A man named Buford Wilson
What's your mama's name child
What's your mama's name

Twenty some odd years ago
A drunkard down in Memphis
Lost a month of life and labor
To the county jail
Just because he asked a little green eyed girl a question
And offered her a nickel's worth of candy if she'd tell

A year and some odd days ago
An old man died in Memphis
Just another wayward soul
The county had to claim
Inside the old man's ragged coat
They found a faded letter
It said you have a daughter
And her eyes are Wilson green
