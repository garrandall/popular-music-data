Reality comes tumbling down
And disappears when she's around

The magic love within her
Has got me hung up in her eyes
I'm hypnotized

The very mention of her name
She slipped with lightning
Through my brain

I dream of ways to win her
When I get hung up in her eyes
And I'm hypnotized

Wa wa wa

I try to tell her how I feel
But when she's near
I can't reveal

The way that I adore her
Cause I just can't
Ignore those eyes
They hypnotize

Wa wa wa
