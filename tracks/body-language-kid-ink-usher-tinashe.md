It's not a lot that you've been saying, whoa.
But I can tell from your body language
Let's talk about it ('bout it)
Is you 'bout it?
Let's talk about it
Can we talk about it?

You ain't gotta say too much
Ain't gotta say too much
I can read your body language
You ain't gotta say too much
I can read your body language


Said you ain't gotta say too much
Hate when you say that I play too much
When I get too close I'm a touch that subject
I can read your body, nuff said
Quit all that yappin'
Meet let's talk and a little more action (Yeah)
Now girl keep it G, know you speak a little freak
I can hear it in yo' accent
So tell me, can you understand my language?
If you tryna ride, just stay in my lane
It's no other way to explain it
A lame in, fuck, who you came with (eghh)


It's not a lot that you've been saying, whoa.
But I can tell from your body language
Let's talk about it
Is you 'bout it?
Let's talk about it
Can we talk about it?

But you ain't gotta say too much
Ain't gotta say too much
I can read your body language
Ain't gotta say too much
I can read your body language


It ain't hard to tell
If you don't wanna take it too far then well
You better stop flirtin' and stop twerkin'
So perfect, cause it's workin'
That ass worth all the worship
You been in yo' bag like Birkin
Never had it like this before me
You ain't know girl better read up on me
You trying to get high, gotta re-up on me
Bein' stuck up gon' leave you lonely for the night
We should leave before the lights on girl
I'm too on


It's not that a lot that you've been saying, whoa.
But I can tell from your body language
Let's talk about it ('bout it)
Is you 'bout it?
Let's talk about it
Can we talk about it?

But you ain't gotta say too much
Ain't gotta say too much
I can read your body language
Ain't gotta say too much
I can read your body language


Oh they say don't judge a book by it's cover
We can make a scene that you be under the cover (Listen)
You ain't gotta say too much
You ain't gotta say too much
(Girl I'm talkin', girl I'm listenin')
(Come closer, lemme hear ya)


It's not that a lot that you've been saying, whoa.
But I can tell from your body language
Let's talk about it ('bout it)
Is you 'bout it?
Let's talk about it
Can we talk about it?

You ain't gotta say too much
Ain't gotta say too much
I can read your body language
You ain't gotta say too much
I can read your body language
