Once a jolly swagman sat beside the billabong,
Under the shade of a coulibah tree,
And he sang as he sat and waited by the billabong,
You'll come a waltzing matilda with me.

Waltzing matilda, waltzing matilda
You'll come a waltzing matilda with me,
And he sang as he sat and waited by the billabong,
You'll come a waltzing matilda with me.

Down came a jumbuck to drink beside the billabong
Up jumped the swagman and seized him with glee
And he sang as he tucked jumbuck in his tuckerbag,
'You'll come a waltzing matilda with me.

Down came the stockman, riding on his thoroughbred,
Down came the troopers, one, two, three.
Where's the jolly jumbuck you've got in your tuckerbag?
You'll come a waltzing matilda with me'.

Up jumped the swagman and plunged into the billabong,
You'll never catch me alive, cried he!
And his ghost may be heard as you ride beside the billabong,
You'll come a waltzing matilda with me.
