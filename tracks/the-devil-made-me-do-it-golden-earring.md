All set, court's in session
This judge, got no compassion
Witness, show me your right hand
I swear, nothing but the truth now

I was alright till she came along
I was alright, then it all went wrong

The devil made me do it, oh, oh, oh,oh
It was the act of a man possessed, now
The devil made me do it, oh, oh ,oh, oh
Your honor, I am innocent

D.A.'s, got a mighty strong case
Lawman, saw the whole thing
Confess, yeah I stole that fur coat
Confess, yeah I stole a BMW
Confess, I was only trying, to keep my baby satisfied
Bullshit, that's the truth now
Bullshit, so help me God

I was alright till she came along
I was alright, then it all went wrong

The devil made me do it, oh, oh, oh,oh
It was an act of a man possessed, now
The devil made me do it , oh, oh, oh, oh
Your honor, I am innocent

You should have seen her slide out of her negligee
Her skin was hot, touch intoxicating
And if you were me , you would have done the same
So spare me the gutter, save me from the ball and chain

The devil made me do it, oh, oh, oh, oh
It was an act of a man possessed now
The devil made me do it, oh, oh, oh, oh
Your honor, I am innocent
