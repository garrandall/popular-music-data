Looking in my mirror
Took me by surprise
I can't help but see you
Running often through my mind

Helpless like a baby
Sensual disguise
I can't help but love you
It is getting better all the time
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no

I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no

Cause we're the party people night and day
Living crazy that's the only way

So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself

I wanna rock with you (all night)
Dance you into day (sunlight)

You got me workin' workin' day and night
You got me workin' workin' day and night

I took my baby to the doctor with a fever
But nothing he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown
Someone's always trying
To start my baby crying
Talking, squealing, lying
Saying you just want to be starting something

'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer thriller tonight

Looking out
Across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs

If they say,
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do it that way
And if they say,
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way

Why, why, oh why

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one

Who will dance on the floor in the round, baby
Mother always told me be careful of who you love
Be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover (x2)

The way you make me feel
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet now babe
My lonely days are gone

Annie, are you ok?
Annie, are you ok?
Are you ok, Annie?
Annie, are you ok?
Annie are you ok?
Are you ok, Annie?
Annie, are you ok?
Annie are you ok? (would you tell us that you're ok Annie)
Are you ok, Annie?
You've been hit by
You've been struck by
A smooth criminal

I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Is that girl with you
Yes we're one and the same
Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
But, if you're thinkin' bout bein' my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

Said if you're thinkin' bout bein' my baby
Don't matter if you're black or white

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Bang bang, shot dead
Everybody's gone mad

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

I'm tired of being the victim of hate
You're ripping me off my pride
Oh, for God's sake
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside

Lyin' here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone

You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

I just want a touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you
Tonight, you give me
You give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I

You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love
I'll be there (I'll be there)
Don't you know baby yeah
I'll be there
I'll be there
Just call my name
I'll be there
