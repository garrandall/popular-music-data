Butterflies
Da, de, da
Da de de da, da de da
Da de de da, da
(Butterflies)
Da de de da, da de da
(Ohh, fly)
Da de de da, de da dum
La de de de da, la de da
La de de de da, la dum, la dum, la dum


All you got to do is walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile when I try to say hello to you, yeah
And all you got to do is not answer my calls when I'm tryna get through
Keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh
I just wanna touch you


I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (And I wish I could be with you)
(Girl, you give me) 'Cause you give me butterflies inside, inside and I


All I got to say is that I must be dreamin', can't be real
You're not here with me, still I can feel you near to me
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful, listen
I would give you anything baby, ah, just make my dreams come true
Oh baby, you give me butterflies


I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (You tonight)
'Cause you give me butterflies inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
(You give me) Ah, 'cause you give me butterflies inside, inside and I


If you would take my hand, baby, I would show you
Guide you to the light, babe
If you would be my love, baby, I will love you
Love you 'til the end of time


I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (Tonight)
(Girl, you give me) 'Cause you give me butterflies inside, inside and I
I just want to touch and kiss (I wanna, I wanna be with you)
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
Ah, you give me butterflies inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
Ah, 'cause you give me butterflies inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss (I wanna, I wanna be with you, girl)
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (I wanna be with you)
'Cause you give me butterflies inside, inside and I
