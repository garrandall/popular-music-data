At times I just don't know
How you could be anything but beautiful
I think that I was made for you
And you were made for me 

And I know that I won't ever change
'Cause we've been friends
Through rain or shine
For such a long, long time 

Laughing eyes and smiling face
It seems so lucky just to have the right
Of telling you with all my might
You're beautiful tonight 

And I know that you will never stray
'Cause you've been that way
From day to day
For such a long, long time 

And when you hold me tight
How could life be anything but beautiful
I think that I was made for you
And you were made for me 

And I know that I won't ever change
'Cause we've been friends
Through rain or shine
For such a long, long time 

And I must say it means so much to me 
To be the one who's telling you
I'm telling you
That you're beautiful
