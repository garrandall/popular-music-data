Now, baby, pull the covers back over my head.
I don't want to get it up outta this bed.
I don't wanna drag it on off to work.
That big boss man is really a flirt.
We've been lovin' all night,
Just about settin' me everything right.
Hope it don't get me.
I'm gonna live it just as long as I can.
I'm gonna make it every part of my plan.
Lovin' all night, hangin' on tight,
No doubt about it, been lovin' all night.

Well, you tell me I'm as pretty as a fresh cut flower,
When you show me how you love me in the wee small hours.
While everybody's sleeping on around this town,
Lovin' all night makes the world go 'round.

We've been lovin' all night,
Just about hittin' me everything right.
Hope it don't get me.
I'm gonna live it just as long as I can.
I'm gonna make it every part of my plan.
Lovin' all night, hangin' on tight,
No doubt about it, been lovin' all night.

Ain't no use talkin' when you're looking so fine;
When you move your body up a-close to mine.
We've been rocking with the rhythm of a beat of our own.
Baby, I'm gonna love you 'till the cows come home.

We've been lovin' all night,
Just about hittin' me everything right.
Hope it don't get me.
I'm gonna live it just as long as I can.
I'm gonna make it every part of my plan.
Lovin' all night, feelin' all right,
No doubt about it, been lovin' all night.

We've been lovin' all night, hangin on tight.
Good God almighty, been loving all night, yeah.
Mmmmm, been lovin' all night.
Been lovin' all night.
Lovin' all night, yeah,
Lovin' all night,
Been lovin' all night.
Memmmm. hey, ahh been lovin' all night.
