I just moved in my new house today
Movin' was hard but I got squared away
Bells started ringin' and chains rattled loud
I knew I'd moved in a haunted house

Still I made up in my mind to stay
Nothin' was a-gonna drive me away
When I seen somethin' that give me the creep
Had one big eye and a-two big feet

I stood right still and I did the freeze
He did the stroll right up to me
Made a noise with his feet that sound like a drum
(Say, you'll be here when the mornin' come?)

Say yes, I'll be here when the mornin' come
I'll be right here and I ain't gonna run
I bought this house now you know I am bold
Ain't no haint gonna run me off

In my kitchen my stove was a-blazin' hot
The coffee was a-boilin' in the pot
The grease had melted in my hand
I had a hunk of meat in my hand

From outer space there sat a man
On a hot stove with the pots and pans
"Say, that's hot" I began to shout
He drank a hot coffee right from the spout

He ate the raw meat right from my hand
Drank a hot grease from the fryin' pan
He said to me "Now, you better run"
(And don't be here when the mornin' come)

Say yes, I'll be here when the mornin' come
I'll be right here and I ain't gonna run
I bought this house now you know I am bold
