(Internet money, bitch)
(We love you, Tecca)

Yeah, ooh, I got lil niggas with the shits
Nigga run up on me, all my niggas 'bout to shoot
Talkin' on the 'Gram, catch a deuce
We can get into it, nigga, what you wanna do?
Nigga, you ain't even have a clue
'Cause I got shottas on me
Sendin' shots, sendin' shots like doctor, homie
Better run, better run, the coppers on me, yeah

Yeah, I know, yeah, I know
Got bad bitches come wherever I go
Married to the money, I can't treat me no hoe
Nigga run up on me, guaranteed we gon' blow
I ain't helpin' nobody, if you ask me, it's a no
If I tell you that I love you, better keep it on the low
I got places that I'm really tryna go
So if you down for the ride, let me know
Hollow chase a nigga, never chase opps
I'm committed to money, I never chase thots
And I'm attracted to guala, so I'ma chase guap
Yeah, I'm attracted to guala, so I'ma chase guap

Ooh, with the shits
Niggas, they we talkin', we gon' shoot
Got Givenchy
Shorty said she want me
I don't really know

Yeah, ooh, I got lil niggas with the shits
Nigga run up on me, all my niggas 'bout to shoot
Talkin' on the 'Gram, catch a deuce
We can get into it, nigga, what you wanna do?
Nigga, you ain't even have a clue
'Cause I got shottas on me
Sendin' shots, sendin' shots like doctor, homie
Better run, better run, the coppers on me, yeah

Ooh, I got lil niggas with the shits
Nigga run up on me, all my niggas 'bout to shoot
Talkin' on the 'Gram, catch a deuce
We can get into it, nigga, what you wanna do?
Nigga, you ain't even have a clue
'Cause I got shottas on me
Sendin' shots, sendin' shots like doctor, homie
Better run, better run, the coppers on me, yeah
