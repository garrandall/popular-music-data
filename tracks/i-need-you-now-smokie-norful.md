Not a second or another minute
Not an hour of another day
But at this moment with my arms outstretched
I need you to make a way as you have done so many times before.
Through a window or an open door,
I stretch my hands to thee
Come rescue me
I need you right away.

I need you now
Not another second or another minute
Not an hour of another day but, Lord
I need you right away

If I never needed you before
To show up and restore all of the faith that I let slip.
While I was yet searching the world for more, the truest friend I have indeed
You're my best friend I know in need,
I stretch my hands to thee
Come rescue me
I need you right away.

The agony of being alone
The fear of doing things on my own
The test and trials that come to make me strong.
The feelings of guilt, hurt, shame, and defeat
The waves and trials that beat upon me
But to know, Lord, that in you I've got victory.

I need you now, Lord,
I need you now (oh)
I need you right now, right now, right now
I need you now
Oh, not another second, not another minute, Lord,
Can't wait another day (oh no, no)
Please, make a way (oh, lord, oh, God, oo yeah)
