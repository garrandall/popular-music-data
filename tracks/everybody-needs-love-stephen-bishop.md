Everybody needs love
You're no exception to the rule
And don't make me feel like a fool

'Cause I'll try a little harder
You'll see it my way someday
Open up
Let me in
Let me in
Let it begin

Everybody needs love
From the old man sleeping in the corner
Everybody needs love
To the baby smiling in a hurricane

Everybody needs love
Why wait around for the sun to shine
Everybody needs love
Don't you worry, love will find you in time

There's been a whole lot of women in my life
But you got 'em beat by a mile

So hold on to your heart
You can't stop it once you start
'Cause you know yes you do

You need me
You need me
I need you
