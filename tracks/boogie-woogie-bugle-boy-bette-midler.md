He was a famous trumpet man from out Chicago way.
He had a boogie style that no one else could play.
He was the top man at his craft,
But then his number came up and he was gone with the draft.

He's in the army now. A blowin' reveille.
He's the boogie-woogie bugle boy of Company B.

They made him blow a bugle for his Uncle Sam.
It really brought him down because he could not jam.
The captain seemed to understand,
Because the next day the cap' went out and drafted the band.

And now the Company jumps when he plays reveille.
He's the boogie-woogie bugle boy of Company B.

A root, a toot, a toodlie-a-da-toot.
He blows it eight to the bar in boogie rhythm.
He can't blow a note unless a bass and guitar is playin' with him.

And the Company jumps when he plays reveille.
He's the boogie-woogie bugle boy of Company B.

He was some boogie-woogie bugle boy of Company B.
And when he played his boogie-woogie bugle he was busy as a busy bee.

And when he played he made the Company jump eight to the bar.
He's the boogie-woogie bugle boy of Company B.

Andata toodliata-toodliata toot toot
He blows it eight to the bar.
He can't blow a note if a bass and guitar isn't with him.

And the Company jumps when he plays reveille.
He's the boogie-woogie bugle boy of Company B.

He puts the boys to sleep with boogie every night,
And wakes 'em up the same way in the early bright.
They clap their hands and stamp their feet,
'Cause they know how it goes when someone gives him a beat.

Whoa, whoa, he wakes 'em up when he plays reveille.
The boogie-woogie bugle boy of Company B.

A root, a toot, a toodli-a-da to toot toot toot
He's blowin' eight to the bar.
He can't blow a note if a bass and guitar isn't, whoa, with him.

And the Company jumps when he plays reveille.
He's the boogie-woogie bugle boy of Company B.
