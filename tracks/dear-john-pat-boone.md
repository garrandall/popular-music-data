Dear John (Dear John)
Oh, how I hate to write
Dear John (Dear John)
I must let you know tonight
That my love for you has gone
There's no reason to go on
For tonight I wed another, dear John

I was overseas in battle
When the postman came to me.
And he handed me a letter. Aw, I was happy as I could be.
You see, the fighting was all over
And the battles, they'd all been won.
Then I, I opened up the letter and it started

Dear John (Dear John)
Oh, how I hate to write
Dear John (Dear John)
I must let you know tonight
That my love for you has gone
There's no reason to go on
For tonight I wed another, dear John
Will you please send back my picture?
You see, my husband wants it now.
When I tell you who I'm wedding
You won't care, dear, anyhow.
Now the ceremony has started
And I'll wed your brother Don.
Please wish us happiness
Forever, dear John.
