When I'm down I make a call
Got the number written on the wall
First it's busy then I try again
Oh, who's she talking to, could it be him?

I got the number and it starts to ring
I get excited and I start to dream
I start to fantasize of memory lane
Then she answers and she says right way
She says I'm home on my own, home all alone
So I got off the phone

(She's tight.) She's ahead of her time
(She's tight.) She's one of a kind
(She's tight.) She's a talented girl
(She's tight.) She's got her head down tight

I have something got to say to you
Amnesia and my train of thought
On the tip, tip of my tongue
I had a vision when I was young

You floated in, we floated up
Through the window and down the hall
I had a smoke and went upstairs
Turned the door and opened the key. She spoke...
I'm on my own, home all alone
So I got off the phone

(She's tight.) She's ahead of her time
(She's tight.) She's one of a kind
(She's tight.) She's a talented girl
(She's tight.) She's got her head down tight

(She's tight.) She's giving me the go
(She's tight.) She's giving me the high sign
(She's tight.) We'll turn off the lights
(She's tight.) Pull down the shades
(She's nice, she's tight.) Turn on the cam'ra
(She's nice, she's tight.) And getting ready for action

Turn off the radio
Turn on the video
