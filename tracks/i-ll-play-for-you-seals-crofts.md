Tonight while the lights are shinin' and the microphone is on, I'll play for you
So many will be the blessings and so short will the time, I'll stay with you
But I'll play for you, I love you yes I do. You can say that I'm your friend
You can see my life begin and end. I'll always play for you

Hear the band, hear the band. Won't you let the music take you, hear the band
And let this night go on forever, and don't you ever stop the music. Let your spirit set you free
Hear the band, hear the band. You can sing and stomp you feet and clap your hands
And these few moments we'll share together, and I'll play for you

I've practiced many years and I have come a long, long way just to play for you
My life is but a song that I have written in many ways, just to say to you
To say, I love you yes I do. And I'd like for you to be
Whatever you would like to be. You'll always be special to me

(repeat chorus)
