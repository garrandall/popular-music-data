We've been friends for oh, so long
I let you share what's mine
But when you mess with the boy I love
It's time to draw the line

Keep your hands (keep your hands) off my baby
I ain't gonna tell you but-a one more time
Oh, keep your hands (keep your hands) off my baby
Girl, you get it through your head
That boy is mine

I don't mind when you lend my clothes
My jewelry and such
But, honey, let's get something straight
There's one thing you don't touch

Keep your hands (keep your hands) off my baby
Girl, you get it through your head
That boy is mine

Keep your hands (keep your hands) off my baby
I ain't gonna tell you but-a one more time
Oh, keep your hands (keep your hands) off my baby
Girl, you get it through your head
That boy is mine

(Keep your hands)
Oh, keep your hands (off my) off my baby (baby)
I ain't gonna tell you twice
(Keep your hands off my)
He's mine (baby)
Yay, yay, yeah, he's mine
(Keep your hands off my)
You better watch yourself, now (baby)
