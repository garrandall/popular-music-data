First when there's nothing
But a slow glowing dream
That your fear seems to hide
Deep inside your mind

All alone, I have cried
Silent tears full of pride
In a world made of steel
Made of stone


Well, I hear the music
Close my eyes, feel the rhythm
Wrap around
Take a hold of my heart


What a feeling
Being's believing
I can have it all
Now I'm dancing for my life

Take your passion
And make it happen
Pictures come alive
You can dance right through your life


Now I hear the music
Close my eyes, I am rhythm
In a flash
It takes hold of my heart


What a feeling
Being's believing
I can have it all
Now I'm dancing for my life

Take your passion
And make it happen
Pictures come alive
You can dance right through your life


What a feeling

What a feeling (I am music now)
Being's believing (I am rhythm now)
Pictures come alive
You can dance right through your life

What a feeling (I can really have it all)
What a feeling (Pictures come alive when I call)
I can have it all (I can really have it all)
Have it all (Pictures come alive when I call)


(Call, call, call, call, what a feeling)
I can have it all (Being's believing)
Being's believing (Take your passion)
And make it happen (make it happen)
What a feeling (What a feeling)
Being's believing (Happen)
Take a passion (Happen)
Being's believing
