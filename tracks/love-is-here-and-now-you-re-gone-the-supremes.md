Love is here
And oh, my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And oh, my darling, now, now you're gone


You persuaded me to love you and I did
But instead of tenderness, I found heartache instead
Into your arms I fell, so unaware
Of the loneliness that was waiting there


You close the door to your heart
And you turned the key
Locked your love away from me


Love is here
And oh, my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
And oh, my darling, now you're gone


You said loving you would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came into my heart
You turned and you walked, just walked away


You stripped me of my dreams
You gave me faith, then took my hope
Look at me now


Look at me
See what loving you has done to me
Look at my face
See how cryin' has left its trace


After you made me all your own
Then you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love, I couldn't keep


My heart cries out for your touch
But you're not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air


Love is here
And oh, my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And oh, my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
Oh, my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
Oh, my darling, now you're gone
