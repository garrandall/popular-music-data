Well now I've got a girl named Sue
She knows what to do
She's just through rockin' from here to my door
She knows I know & run back into
That's my little Suzie
She knows what to do

She rocks to the left & she rocks to the right
I'm so tired don't even know what's a-right
When my baby gets a-tired of me
I'm gonna do just like misery
Gonna drop my Sue
& go very very very far & again

Well she gets me on the floor every now & then
Just rocks all around my head
I don't even know what to do with Sue, Sue, Sue

Well now she rocks to the right & she rocks to the left
Sometimes I don't know where to go
When my baby gets a hold of me
I'm so tired I can't set her free
So come on Suzie, baby, let's rock again
Let's get all so tired, this heart &
Come on baby, let's just rock once again, 'gain

Well now, Suzie, baby, knows how to rock
Sometimes I don't even know when to stop
She just shakes me all over my head
When she gets me doin' the hen

Well come on now, we'll rock again
Come on baby, never set me again
Come on baby, let me come rockin' again oh yeah oh yeah
Come rockin' again oh yeah oh yeah
Come rockin' again
