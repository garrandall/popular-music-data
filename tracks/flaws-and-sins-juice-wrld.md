You work numbers, work wonders
You done woke me up from my eternal slumber
I'm the lightening, you're the thunder
There's a difference between "I need you" and "I want you"
Girl, I need you
Good sex led to conversations
Gettin' a little deeper, uh
Tell me your darkest secret shit you wouldn't even tell Jesus
Uh, our karma been tweakin' so much, I don't even believe in karma
But you give me a reason to thank God for all these recent falls

Percocet thirty-eight
I been gettin' off
I done chilled out on the drugs since you been involved
Suck it like it's love
Fuck me like it's love
No protection on my heart
Goddammit, I'm gon' hit it raw
Traumatized from my past, yeah, I keep a log
In my mind, in my head, where that shit belong
They say you after my bread, shit, I hope they wrong
You already ran up the bands, we can have a ball

Hit her from the back, I'm in her
I call a play, huddle up
This that good love
In the bedroom
Fuck you on the Prada
Poke her face like Lady Gaga
Ride it like a Mazda
Zoom zoom zoom

I'm all, I'm really all in
In love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
Ain't that a weird way to give compliments

I'm all, I'm really all in
I fell in love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
I see your light in all the darkness

Woah, attaboy! I been turned to a man
Hot chills when my skin is on your skin
Hope you know that if you ever try to end
You gon' catch a couple out the F&N
That mean Cupid ain't give you a headshot
So I ain't got no choice but to leave you with a headshot
Look at the way I make that fuckin' bed rock
Where your ring finger at? I need wedlock
Got my sights on your ass, oh red dot
We some bats that made it outta Hell, oh red hot
Ay, go all night, bitch, don't stop
We ain't gon' be finished till the sun's up

I'm all, I'm really all in
In love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
Ain't that a weird way of givin' compliments

I'm all, I'm really all in
In love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
That's my way of givin' compliments

I'm all, I'm really all in
In love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
Ain't that a weird way to give compliments

I'm all, I'm really all in
I fell in love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
I see your light in all the darkness
