You take a mortal man
And put him in control
Watch him become a God
Watch people's heads a'roll
A'roll...
A'roll...

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony of destruction

Acting like a robot
Its metal brain corrodes
You try to take its pulse
Before the head explodes
Explodes...
Explodes...

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony
Swaying to the symphony of destruction

The earth starts to rumble
The world powers fall
A warring for the Heavens
A peaceful man stands tall
A tall...
A tall...

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony
Swaying to the symphony of destruction
