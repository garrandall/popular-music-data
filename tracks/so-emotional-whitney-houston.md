I've been hearing your heartbeat inside of me
I keep your photograph beside my bed
In a world of fantasies
Can't get you out of my head

I've been waiting for the phone to ring all night
Why you wanna make me feel so good
I got a love of my own
Shouldn't get so hung up on you

I remember the way we touched
I wish I didn't like it so much

I get so emotional baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do

I gotta watch you walk in the room baby
I gotta watch you walk out
I like the animal way you move
And when you talk I just watch your mouth

Oh I remember the way that we touched
I wish I didn't like it so much

I get so emotional baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional
Ain't it shocking what love can do

Oh I get so emotional baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional
Ain't it shocking what love can do
