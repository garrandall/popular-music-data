I need, I need...
I need, I need...
I need, I need...
I need, I need...
I need, I need...


Love, love, love, love, 'long as we got
Love, love, love, oh, 'long as we got

Done with these niggas, I don't love these niggas
I dust off these niggas, do it for fun
Don't take it personal, personally
I'm surprised you called me after the things I said
Skrrr, skrrr on niggas
Skirt up on niggas
Skirt down, you acting like me
Acting like we, wasn't more than a summer fling
I said farewell, you took it well
Promise I won't cry over spilled milk
Gimme a paper towel, gimme another Valium
Gimme another hour or two, hour with you

Why you bother me when you know you don't want me?
Why you bother me when you know you got a woman?
Why you hit me when you know you know better?
Know you know better
Know your crew better than you do
Call me looking for ya
I be looking for ya
Got me looking forward to weekends
With you, baby, with you, baby
With you, baby, with you
We do whatever we want, go wherever we want
Love however we want, it don't matter
You'll do whatever I want, get whatever I want
Get whatever I need, it's about...

Love, love, love, love, 'long as we got
Love, love, love, 'long as we got

Should've never gave you my number, I did it with you
Should've never let you hit it, I split it with you
I regret it, you gots a fetish
You gots a problem, now it's a problem, oh, no
Skrrr, skrrr on bitches
I don't know these bitches
Dig dirt on bitches, do it for fun
Don't take it personal, baby
Love on my ladies, luh-love to my ladies, uh
Dated a few


Why you bother me?
Why you bother me?
Why you bother me?
Last time I checked you were the one that left
Me in a wreckâyahâ, me in a mess
You all I repâyahâ, like my side I rep
Yuh, that's that Mo City that side
That you can't come 'round at night, yuh
You like to get me high, you don't want no one beside ya
You like when I make fire
You say, "La Flame, keep makin' fire"
Let me cum inside ya, let me plant that seed inside ya
Ass and titties, titties, only thing that stuck with, with me
Whippin', that was real
Only thing I could feel, you feel me?
So why you bother me, why you bother me?
Tryna catch a P.O.V, yah


Love, love, love, love, 'long as we got
Love, love, love, 'long as we got

I came to your city, lookin' for lovin' n' licky
'Cause you promised to put it down
All up in your city, lookin' for you, uh
Searchin' for you like love
Only thing keepin' me from droppin' you right now
Right now (love)
Only thing keepin' me by your side
Only thing keepin' me by your side now

"But see, SolÃ¡na, if you don't say something, speak up for yourself. They think you stupid, you know what I'm saying?"
