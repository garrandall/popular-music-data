We used to laugh
We used to cry
We used to bow our heads then
Wonder why
But now you're gone
I guess i'll carry on
And make the best of what you've left to me
Left to me, left to me
I need you
Like the flower needs the rain
You know, I need you
Guess i'll start it all again
You know, I need you
Like the winter needs the spring
You know I need you
I need you
And every day
I'd laugh the hours away
Just knowing you were thinking of me
Then it came
That I was put to blame
For every story told about me
About me, about me
I need you
Like the flower needs the rain
You know, I need you
Guess i'll start it all again
You know, I need you, I need you
I need you
Like the winter needs the spring
You know I need you
Guess I'll start it all again, you know
I need you, I need you
I need you like the flower needs the rain
You know I need you
Guess I'll start it all again, you know
I need you, I need you, I need you
Like the winter needs the spring
You know I need you
Guess I'll start it all again, you know
I need you, I need you, I need you
