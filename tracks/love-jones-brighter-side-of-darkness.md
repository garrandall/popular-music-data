What's happening, baby
Did you miss me over the weekend
If you did, I'm sorry

But now that I'm here
I don't want to bore you
With an irrelevant conversation
But you see, darling
It's about time for me to
Get real serious about you

Because if someone was
To rip me off of you
I couldn't account for
My actions, after all
And knowing the way I feel
Knowing that you should
Be mine, all the time

But you see
I not only want you, baby
I need you

And the need is so strong
It's almost like that of a junkie
In other words, baby
I just got to have you
Listen to me, darling
Please, listen to me

Love Jones, I got a Love Jones
I got a Love Jones for you
Love Jones, I got a Love Jones
I got a Love Jones for you

What, baby
What is a Love Jones
Shucks, darling
It's when you love someone
Very, very much and you
Just can't seem to
Get yourself together

Like last Friday in class
When Mr. Russell was
Giving us the test
I was sitting up, staring at you
And daydreaming
I know I failed
A test paper with
Nothing but my name on it

I guess anybody can
Have a Love Jones
It's just love, the true love
The way I feel about you
That's a Love Jones

Love Jones, I got a Love Jones
I got a Love Jones for you
Love Jones, I got a Love Jones
I got a Love Jones for you
