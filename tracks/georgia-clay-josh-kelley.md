Ain't it funny how some things take you back
And the here and now just fades to black
When I pulled that blue tarp off that time machine
Man, it hits me
Seventeen years old runnin' on dumb luck
Spent the whole darn summer livin' in that truck
Them old tires still covered in all that mud
Like it sticks with me in my blood


When life was nothing more than living for the night
Just try'na steal a kiss on the tailgate of that ride
Good ole days don't wash away, just like that Georgia clay


Only one of my friends with a fake ID
It made me the hometown celebrity
Used to put her in park in a vacant lot
Yeah still can't believe we never got caught


When life was nothing more than living for the night
Just try'na steal a kiss on the tailgate of that ride
Good ole days don't wash away, just like that Georgia clay
All over everything
Every last memory
Man it's all comin' back to me

Ain't it funny how some things take you back


When life was nothing more than living for the night
Just try'na steal a kiss on the tailgate of that ride
Good ole days don't wash away, that's some things they just don't change
Just like that Georgia clay
All over everything
Every last memory
It's all comin' back to me
