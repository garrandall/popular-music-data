Santana:
You know the bed feels warmer
Sleeping here alone
You know I dream in color
And do the things I want

Brittany:
You think you got the best of me
Think you had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'd come running back
Baby you don't know me 'cause you're dead wrong

The Troubletones:
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

Mercedes & Santana:
You heard that I was starting over with someone new
They told you I was moving on, over you

Brittany:
You didn't think that I'd come back
I'd come back swinging
You try to break me, but you see

The Troubletones:
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

Santana:
Thanks to you I've got a new thing started

Mercedes:
Thanks to you I'm not the broken-hearted

Santana:
Thanks to you I'm finally thinkin' 'bout me

Mercedes & Santana:
You know in the end the day you left was just my beginning

Santana:
In the end...

The Troubletones:
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone (Mercedes: Not alone)

Stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I (Mercedes: Yeah)
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller (Mercedes: Stronger)
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone (Mercedes: Not alone)
