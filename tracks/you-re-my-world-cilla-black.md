You're my world, you're every breath I take
You're my world, you're every move I make
Other eyes see star up in the skies
But for me they shine within your eyes
As the trees reach for the sun above
So my arms reach out to you for love
With your hand resting in mine I feel a power so divine


You're my world, you are my night and day
You're my world, you're every breath I breathe
If our love ceased to be
Then it's the end of my world for me

With your hand resting in mine I feel a power so divine


You're my world, you are my night and day
You're my world, you're every breath I breathe
If our love ceased to be
Then it's the end of my world
End of my world
End of my world for me
