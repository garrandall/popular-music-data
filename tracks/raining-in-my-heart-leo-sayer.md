The sun is out, the sky is blue
There's not a cloud to spoil the view
But it's raining
Raining in my heart
The weatherman says fine today
He doesn't know that you've gone away
And it's raining
Raining in my heart
Oh misery, Oh misery
Oh misery
What's gonna become of me, oh
I tell myself, my blues won't show but I know
That soon all my tears will flow
Come a raining down, raining in my heart



Oh misery, Oh misery
Oh misery
What's gonna become of me, oh
The sun is out, the sky is blue
There's not a cloud to spoil the view
But it's raining, oh it's raining in my heart
