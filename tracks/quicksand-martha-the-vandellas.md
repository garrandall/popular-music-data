Quicksand, quicksand
Pulling me closer, closer in your arms
Can't resist your loving charms
You're like quicksand sinking me deeper in love with you

The more I fight it, the deeper in love I get
Each time you hold me
I feel nothing but happiness
It's not safe loving you this way
But from your arms I can't stay

You're like quicksand, quicksand, yeah
Pulling me closer, closer
Making me love you, need you
Sinking me deeper, deeper in love with you

Deeper, deeper, deeper
In love with you

My heart is a prisoner of your warm embrace
I can't help, I can't help myself
Nothing can take your place
When you say sweet things to me
I start trembling from head to feet

You're like quicksand, quicksand, yeah
Pulling me closer, closer
I just can't resist you
I just want to kiss you
You're like quicksand, yeah

Quicksand, quicksand, quicksand pulling me closer
Quicksand, quicksand, quicksand pulling me closer
Deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper in love with you
Deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper in love with you
Quicksand, quicksand, quicksand pulling me closer
