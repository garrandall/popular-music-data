Well, I was 18, makin' minimum wage,
With a Letterman jacket and a Chevrolet.
I thought I was cool, yeah, I ruled the school.
You were Coolatta with the strawberry lips,
You had the whole world danglin' at your fingertips.
Your senior year, and I was your daddy's worst fear.
We ran off on graduation night.
Thought a couple of left-hand rings would make everything all right.

With a little bit a-live, little bit a-learn,
Little bit a-watchin' a few more candles burn,
And findin' out what life was.
Oh, with a little bit a-fuss, little bit a-fight,
Little bit a-kiss and makin' up all night,
An' one day wakin' up, oh, in a real love.
Yes, that's right.

Well, I was 22, workin' double overtime.
I was spendin' dollars and makin' dimes.
We were overdrawn and barely hangin' on.
An' then one night you came to me,
With tears in your eyes and the EPT and said:
"Guess what? Yeah, baby ready or not."
Well, I just smiled but I was scared to death:
How am I gonna' have a kid when I'm only a kid myself.

With a little bit a-live, little bit a-learn,
Little bit a-watchin' a few more candles burn,
And findin' out what life was.
Oh, with a little bit a-fuss, little bit a-fight,
Little bit a-kiss and makin' up all night,
An' one day, wakin' up, oh, in a real love.
Whoa, in a real love.
Yeah, it's a real love.

Mmm, with a little bit a-live, little bit a-learn,
Little bit a-watchin' a few more candles burn,
And findin' out what life was.
Mmm, with a little bit a-fuss, little bit a-fight,
Little bit a-kiss and makin' up all night,
An' one day, wakin' up, oh, in a real love.
Yeah, baby, it's a real love.
Yeah, it's a real love, baby.
Whoa, it's a real, real, real, real, real, real, real love.
Yeah, that's right.
Hey.
