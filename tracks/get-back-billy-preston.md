Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, yeah, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jo Jo

Jo Jo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it wouldn't last
Jo Jo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back, yeah
Get back to where you once belonged

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around said she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Get back, get back, yeah
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, yeah, woo, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back, yeah, get on back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, yeah, woo, get back
Get back to where you once belonged, now, now

Get back, yeah, get on back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, yeah, woo, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Woo

Get back Loretta
Your mama's waiting for you
With her high heel shoes and her low neck sweater
Get back, Loretta

Get back, yeah, get on back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, yeah, get on back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back, yeah, woo, get back, yeah, woo
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, yeah, woo, get back, yeah
Get back to where you once belonged
