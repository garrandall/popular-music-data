Jo Jo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jo Jo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back Jo Jo
Go home

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jo

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Oh, get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Loretta

Go home
Oh, get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Ooh, ooh, get back, Loretta
Your mommy's waiting for you
Wearing her high-heel shoes
And her low-neck sweater
Get back home, Loretta

Get back, get back, get back to where you once belonged
Oh, get back, get back
Get back, oh, yes
Jo Jo
