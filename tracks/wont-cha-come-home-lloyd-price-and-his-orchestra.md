Oh baby, please come home
Won'tcha come home
I'm sick and I'm all alone
Won'tcha come home
Oh, I love and miss you so
Won'tcha come home
How much you'll never know
Won'tcha come home

Whoa, I need you
That's why I'm blue
Come on home
Won'tcha come home
Come on home

And I never thought I'd feel this way
Won'tcha come home
When you up and left that day
Won'tcha come home
But things haven't been the same
Won'tcha come home
All I ever hear is your name
Won'tcha come home

Whoa, I need you
That's why I'm blue
Come on home
Won'tcha come home
Come on home

Whoa, I get so tired of bein' alone
I can't even reach you by telephone
Believe me baby, when I call on you
I've got a whole lot of heartache from missing you
Now tell me baby, how long
Won'tcha come home
And must I sing this song
Won'tcha come home
Oh, I must stop this third degree
Won'tcha come home
Honey, it's killing me
Won'tcha come home

Whoa, I need you
That's why I'm blue
Come on home
Won'tcha come home
Come on home

I never thought I'd feel this way
Won'tcha come home
When you up and left that day
Won'tcha come home
But things haven't been the same
Won'tcha come home
All I ever hear is your name
Won'tcha come home

Whoa, I need you
That's why I'm blue
Come on home
Won'tcha come home
Come on home

Won'tcha come home
Come on home
Won'tcha come home
Come on home
Won'tcha come home
Come on home
