All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'mma sing until I feel it, I'mma go until itâs done
I donât need to say wassup and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older, somebody shoulda told you
I'm on one
You know I'm on one, yeah
I said I'm on one
You know, I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink, it could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that ish, money that we got, never get that ish
Cause I'm on one, yeah
You know I'm one one, yeah yeah

You know what I like
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yes, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah

You just need to listen, I teach you how to fix it
Cause you're the only one cause I don't trust these women
I don't, I don't trust these women cause they might have me slipping
You're the only one
I don't trust these women cause they might have me slipping
Cause you're the only one cause I don't trust these women
I don't, I don't trust these women cause they might have me slipping
Cause you're the only one

Oh woah, trust issues, oh woah, trust issues
Oh woah, trust issues, oh woah
Oh yeah, oh yeah


(Oh yeah, let's call up one drink and let's all get wasted
One drink and let's all get faded, yeah)

Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the motherfucking North Side
Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sitting courtside
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You acting like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me, how the fuck we supposed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?
I could tell, I could tell, I could tell certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more, guess that they don't really make em like me no more
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in and tell them all leave their cell phones
On the table where we see them
I'm all day with it man, A.M to the P.M
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him, that's that ish that drives me crazy
And that's all I've been getting lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women want to fuck like they're me and I'm them
Looking for some things and I think that I can find them in you

Oh woah, trust issues, oh woah, trust issues
Oh woah, trust issues, oh woah

Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Let's call up one drink and let's all get wasted
One drink and let's all get faded, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Call up one drink and let's, let's call up one, uh
