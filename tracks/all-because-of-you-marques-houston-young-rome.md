 (Corna Boys..)

I can't blame you if you wanna leave
Cause I'm not the man that I once used to be
But there's a change that has come over me
So before you go, listen to my last plea


(all because of you) oh you're the love of my life
And I was doing wrong but I wanna do right girl
(all because of you) staying out all night
Wanna make it right, wanna change my life girl
(all because of you) I don't wanna play no games
Wanna change your name to my name baby
(all because of you) not gon' be the man that I used to be, no
I changed because of you

Can't take back the things that I did before
But baby I'm promising that my heart is yours(yours)
Know it ain't easy baby, but you gotta believe me baby
All I'm asking for is one more chance, I changed because of you


(all because of you) oh you're the love of my life
And I was doing wrong but I wanna do right girl
(all because of you) staying out all night
Wanna make it right, wanna change my life girl
(all because of you) I don't wanna play no games
Wanna change your name to my name baby
(all because of you) not gon' be the man that I used to be
I changed because of you

I-I-I-I, I wanna do right by you girl
I-I-I-I, I wanna spend my life with you girl
I don't wanna play no games, wanna change your name to my name baby
I'm turning in my player's card... all because of you


It used to be that you in the club popping bottles, wrists glistening
Shorty tried to tell me 'chill', but I wasn't listening
I can't deny, you knew me from being immature
My way of saying 'sorry', take you to the country store
You told me all you really wanted was to see me more
Then the stress hit me hard like a meteor
I hit rock bottom, you was there to pick me up
I neglected you we didn't hug, didn't kiss enough
But you never threw nuttin up in my face
Gave me all your love and your warm embrace
But now I see I'll neva find another like you
You the type boo, make a playa wanna wife you
But me and you, this money's not a issue
When I miss you, when I touch you, I can feel it it in my bone gristle
I'm still wit you and I'm sorry bout the way I did you


(all because of you) oh you're the love of my life
And I was doing (oh wrong but I wanna do right girl
(all because of you) staying out all night (no more staying out at night, oh
Wanna make it right, wanna change my life girl
(all because of you) I don't wanna play no games (see I don't wanna play no games, no games, yea, oh
Wanna change your name to my name baby
(all because of you) not gon' be the man that I used to be (not the man I used to be, nooo, yea yea)
I changed because of you
