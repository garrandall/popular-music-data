I think this party is going badly
Is there something wrong
I see faces looking sadly
Have I stayed too long

Even though I see me smile
That same scene and acting wild
Pretending that I really care
Smiling face is just a mask

Without love a kiss is nothing
Have I done something wrong
I look around and I can't find nothing
Have I stayed too long

Without beginning there ain't no end
Without a hope, you got no friends
Have I gone from loving you
To find out what's behind my tears

I got to get out of this place
I'm tired, tired of waiting
This phony place

I think this party is going badly
Is there something wrong
I see faces looking sadly
I guess I'm going home

Even though you see me smiling
That same scene and acting wild
Pretending that I really care
Smiling face is just a mask
