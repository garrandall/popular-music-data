Oh my where do


How do I begin
To answer
The question
I know you been wonderin'
When could
Why could
How could it all be true
These things
Who's that
And what is he to you?


He is
The mind injector
The heart protector
The soul defender of anything I fear
The baby conceiver
The make me believer
The joy bringer
The love giver
He is
The dough increaser
The pleasure releser
The hard knocks knowler without the scars to show ya
The night school teacher
The good life preacher
The caretaker
The kiss craver
He is


The words 
Are only
Frosting on my cake
Feelings
Explained
Don't do justice to how I
Feel...so alive
So in love for the first time
No way
Can I hide
Who...what...



He is
So 
He is
So
Everything, everything I wanted, I wanted
He is
So
He is
So and so much more than I thought it could be
So I
So I
So I gotta be the same for him
Gotta be the same for him



The make it alrighter
The get you through the nighter
The soul defender of anything I fear
The pain remover
The bad times undoer
The joy bringer
The love giver
He is
