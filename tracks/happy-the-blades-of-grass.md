Happy is the day I found you
Happy is the world around you
I'm never sad as long as
We're together
My happiness is you

Happy is the way I love you
Happy is just thinking of you
I found a lifetime of pleasure
A lifetime of treasure
In the happiness of you


You're the girl I want to marry
You're the girl that makes
You're the girl that makes
You're the girl that makes
You're the girl that makes me happy

Happy is our lives together
Happy is our love forever
What more in life could you give me
Happiness is living all my life with you



Happy is our lives together
Happy is our love forever
What more in life could you give me
Happiness is living all my life with you

You, ahhh
