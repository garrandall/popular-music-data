Doo doo doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo doo

There was a rose I knew
I met her once or twice before
She was a pretty sweet thing
Not the least bit insecure

Then you came with your slick game
And played with her youth
Unashamed of the way you lied
Played with the truth, hey hey

Mmm, she never knew what hit her, yeah
Steal her honey, then forget her
A rose, she wears a flower
Tryin' to forget about you

'Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power

Now believe me when I tell you
That I've been hurt myself
When he tells you that he loves you
And sees nobody else

And now you're so tough tryin' to
Wear tight clothes and things
Tossin' and flossin'
Tryin' to fill the void heartbreak brings

Oh yeah, when she faces the mirror, yeah
She's cryin', you can't hear her
Now the rose is still a rose
She wears a flower, tryin' to forget about you

'Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby girl, you hold the power

See a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power

Let your life be in the sunshine
Not the darkness of your sorrow
You may see you're all today
When you know it'll come tomorrow

Tough to be, but life ain't over
Just because your man is gone
Girl, love yourself and love to love
'Cause without him your life goes on

Without him your life goes on
Without him your life goes on

'Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby girl, you hold the power

See a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power
