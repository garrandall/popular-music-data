Love, ooh, love
Desire
Love, ooh, love
Desire

Love, desire
Love

Oh, oh, oh...
Love and desire, yeah
You are my love and desire
Love and desire
Love and desire

You pick me up when I'm down
And you make my spirit brighter
I just can't get enough of your love
I'm a man who's soul is on fire

There is nothing that I'd like better
Than the feeling that I get
When you're lying in my arms
And my head begins to sweat

What a feeling I get with you
?
It's just that good old love and desire
And it's running through my veins

Love and desire
Love and desire
Love and desire
Love and desire

Love, ooh, love
Desire
Love, ooh, love
Desire
Love, ooh, love
Desire

Love, desire
Love, hey, hey

What I feel in my heart for you
Is so easy to explain
It's just that good old
Love and desire
It's running through my veins

Love and desire
Love and desire
Love and desire
Love and desire

Love and desire
You are my
Love and desire

Love, ooh, love
Desire
Love, ooh, love
Desire...
