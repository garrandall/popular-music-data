Day after day
I've been pacing the floor
Wondering how I got in
This mess I'm in

And I'm left to
Conclude once again
What I knew all along
That the only way out is in

There's only one thing left to do
It's up to me to come to you
I just can't get you
Out of my heart

I surrender
You've got me where you want me
I surrender
And ever since I saw you
I haven't been the same

I, I, I, I surrender, yeah
You're such a persuasive woman
And you're the only one here
Who can end this pain

Year after year
I was running around
Playing hard to get
To know who's who

Then like that
In the middle of the night
The guru thumbed a ride and
Said have I got a woman for you

And I saw you dancing all alone
Your eyes flashed and I was blind
Now I can't get you
Out of my mind

I surrender
You got (you got) you got me
Where you want me
I surrender

I, I, I surrender
You're such a persuasive woman
I surrender

I, I, I, I, I surrender
(Surrender)

Surrender
