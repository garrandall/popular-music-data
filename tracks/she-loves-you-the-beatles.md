She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


You think you've lost your love
Well, I saw her yesterday
It's you she's thinking of
And she told me what to say


She says she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad


She said you hurt her so
She almost lost her mind
But now she said she knows
You're not the hurting kind


She says she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad, ooh


She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
With a love like that
You know you should be glad


You know it's up to you
I think it's only fair
Pride can hurt you, too
Apologise to her


Because she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
She loves you
And you know you should be glad, ooh


She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
With a love like that
You know you should be glad


With a love like that
You know you should be glad
With a love like that
You know you should be glad
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
