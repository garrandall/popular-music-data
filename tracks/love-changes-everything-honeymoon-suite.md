There was a time
I wore different face
I stood alone
Feelings had no place
I've givin' it all
Taking nothing back
You brought this lonely heart
Back in from the cold

Just like a fire
Burning higher
You got my heart on a string
But now I know, love changes everything

I don't need money
Don't need no fame
I gained only wisdom from so long in the game
I built such a wall
Love was just too dangerous
Turned around you were right behind me
There to catch my fall

Just like a fire
Burning higher
You got my heart on a string
But now I know, love changes everything
Just like a fire
Burning higher
You got my heart on a string
But now I know, love changes everything

Only a fool believes in a heart of steel
Yesterdays behind me now, whoa

Just like a fire
Burning higher
She's got my heart on a string
But now I know, love changes everything
Just like a fire
Burning higher
She's got my heart on a string
But now I know, love changes everything

Just like a fire
You got me burning
You got me on a string
But now I know, love changes everything
Just like a fire
You got me burning
