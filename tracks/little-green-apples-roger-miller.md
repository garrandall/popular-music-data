Well I wake up in the morning 
With my hair down in my eyes and she says 'hi'
Then I stumble to the breakfast table
Where the kids are going off to school, goodbye
Then she reaches out takes my hand and squeezes it 
And says 'how you feeling hon'
Then I look across the smiling lips 
That warms my heart and see my morning sun

And if that's not loving me all then all I've got to say
'God didn't make those little green apples
It don't rain in Indianapolis in the summer time
And there's no such thing as dr soos, 
or Disney land or mother goose or nursery rhymes
'God didn't make those little green apples
It don't rain in Indianapolis in the summer time

And when myself is feeling low I think about her face 
Aglow to ease my mind

Sometimes I call her up at home knowing she's busy
And asked her if she can get away and meet me
And grab a bite to eat 
And she drops what she's doing hurries down to meet me
And I'm always late 
But she sits waiting patiently smiles when she first sees me
'Cos she's made that way

And if that's not loving me all then all I've got to say
'God didn't make those little green apples
It don't snow in Indianapolis when the winter comes
And there's no such thing as make believe no puppy dogs
No autumn leaves no
