Words are easy to be spoken
I know that and so do you
But when I say I love you, darling
Every word of it was true
Fancy words, I never use them
Since I met you from the start
Plain old simple words are better
They come directly from the heart
When I take your hand forever
All the chapel bells will chime
Woah, we will say I do together
And with these words
I'll make you mine
(With these words)
