Why am I treated so bad
Why am I treated so bad
You know I'm all alone
While I sing this song
Hear my call
I've done nobody wrong
But I'm treated so bad
Ohh so bad

I'm gonna run
Up to my baby's door
Ask him why
Why, why
He don't love me no more

He was wrong
Said I was too vain
But I'll walk on in
And love him just the same
Thought he treats me so bad
Ohhh so bad
