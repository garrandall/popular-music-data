Have mercy on my eyes
Lady, whatcha wearing now?
You know it's a crime
The way you look in clothes

Girl
You take the prize
Five foot five
And dressed to kill
Strike my fancy every time
You strike a pose


There's one more outfit
That I ain't seen yet
One more outfit
That looks great
I bet

I bet you sure look cute
In your birthday suit
I bet you sure look cute
In your birthday suit

You've got your best feature
Straight from Mother Nature
Now I bet you sure look cute
In your birthday suit


Got so many shoes
You got satin
You got lace
You got things from head to toe
That make you look so hot

Don't have to pick and choose
You don't have to shop around
I don't think you really know
What you already got




Sure looks good, baby

Flash that smile
And work that hair (aw yeah!)
Give it all you've got
(Say what?)

When the photographer starts to shoot
Make sure you're wearing
Your birthday suit
