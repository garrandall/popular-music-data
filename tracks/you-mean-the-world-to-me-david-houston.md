Daylight comes and bluebirds sing and outside the grass is green
But I don't care if sun shines or it rains
Cause I'm happy as I can be as long as you will stand by me
And nothing beside of heaven can make me change
Cause you you mean all the world to me

You start my day with one sweet kiss
You keep my world turnin' with tenderness
And you always say the right things when I'm blue
When dark clouds gettin' to cover my sky
And temptation looks me straight in the eye
It all disappears when you say I love you
Cause you you mean all the world to me
You you mean all the world to me you you
