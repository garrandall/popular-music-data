Baby
It's been a long day,
Baby
Things ain't been going my way
You know I need you here
To clear my mind
All the time

And baby
The way you move me,
It's crazy
It's like you see right through me
And make it easier
Believe me,
You don't even have to try

Oh, because

You are the best thing
(you're the best thing)
You are the best thing
(you're the best thing, baby)
You are the best thing
(you're the best thing, oh)
Ever happened to me

Baby
We've come a long way
Baby
You know I hope and I pray
That you believe me
When I say
This love will never fade away

Oh, because

You are the best thing
(you're the best thing)
You are the best thing
(you're the best thing, baby)
You are the best thing
(you're the best thing, oh)
Ever happened to me

Both of us have known love before,
To come on all promising like a spring
Then walk on out the door
Our hearts are strong and our hearts are kind
Let me tell you just exactly what's on my mind

You are the best thing
(you're the best thing)
You are the best thing
(you're the best thing, baby)
You are the best thing
(you're the best thing, oh)
Ever happened to me

You are the best thing
(you're the best thing)
You are the best thing
(you're the best thing, baby)
You are the best thing
(you're the best thing, oh)
Ever happened to me

You are the best thing
You are the best thing
You are the best thing
That ever happened to me
