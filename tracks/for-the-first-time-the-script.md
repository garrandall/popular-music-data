She's all laid up in bed with a broken heart
While I'm drinking Jack all alone in my local bar
And we don't know how
How we got into this mad situation
Only doing things out of frustration
Tryna make it work, but, man, these times are hard


She needs me now but I can't seem to find the time
I got a new job now on the unemployment line
And we don't know how
How we got into this mess, is it God's test?
Someone help us 'cause we're doing our best
Tryna make it work, but, man, these times are hard
But we're gonna start by


Drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Shit talking up all night
Saying things we haven't for a while, a while, yeah
We're smiling but we're close to tears
Even after all these years
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting
For the first time


She's in line at the dole with her head held high
While I just lost my job but didn't lose my pride
And we both know how
How we're going to make it work when it hurts
When you pick yourself up you get kicked to the dirt
Tryna make it work, but, man, these times are hard
But we're gonna start by


Drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Shit talking up all night
Doing things we haven't for a while, a while, yeah
We're smiling but we're close to tears
Even after all these years
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting
For the first time


Drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Shit talking up all night
Saying things we haven't for a while
We're smiling but we're close to tears
Even after all these years
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting
For the first time


Yeah, for the first time
Oh, for the first time
Yeah, for the first time
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting for the first time


Oh, these times are hard
Yeah, they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me, baby
Oh, these times are hard
Yeah, they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me, baby
Oh, these times are hard
Yeah, they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me, baby
Oh, these times are hard
Yeah, they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me, baby
