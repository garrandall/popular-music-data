Home is where I'm goin'
No matter how long it takes
And I've been livin' high 'n' free, love
It's time for me to try another way
I think I'll send her a postcard
So she can meet my plane
Well I don't know what I'll say to her
I've caused her so much pain
Houston, I'm-a comin' to see you
Houston, has it really been that lo-hong
I know I've been away
But I'm just callin' to tell you I'm leavin' today-hay-ay-hay-ay
Sittin' here in San Francisco
Lord I'm tryin' to get more pay
You know it's good to hear your voice again
You say the words I like to hear you say
Now I'm tryin' to read your letter
It's been almost a year
It did me good to get away from you
Now I'm wishin' you were here
Houston, I'm-a comin' to see you
Houston, has it really been that lo-hong
I know I've been away
But I'm just callin' to tell you I'm leavin' today-hay-ay
Houston, I'm-a comin' to see you
Houston, has it really been that lo-hong
Houston, Houston, Houston (Yeah, I'm a comin' to see you)
Houston, has it really been that lo-ho-ho-ong
Houston, Houston, Houston
(Yeah, I'm a comin' to see you), Houston (fade)
