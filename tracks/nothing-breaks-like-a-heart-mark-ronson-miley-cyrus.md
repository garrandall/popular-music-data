This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
And nothing breaks like a heart


I heard you on the phone last night
We live and die by pretty lies
You know it, oh, we both know it
These silver bullet cigarettes
This burning house, there's nothing left
It's smoking, we both know it
We got all night to fall in love
But just like that, we fall apart
We're broken, we're broken


Mmm, well, nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now


Well, there's broken silence
By thunder crashing in the dark (Crash in the dark)
And this broken record
Spin endless circles in the bar (Spin 'round in the bar)
This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
Mhmm, and nothing breaks like a heart


We'll leave each other cold as ice
And high and dry, the desert wind
Is blowin', is blowin'
Remember what you said to me?
We were drunk in love in Tennessee
And I hold it, we both know it


Mmm, that nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now
Nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now


Well, there's broken silence
By thunder crashing in the dark (Crash in the dark)
And this broken record
Spin endless circles in the bar (Spin 'round in the bar)
This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
Mmm, and nothing breaks like a heart
Nothing breaks like a heart
Mmm, and nothing breaks like a heart


My heart, my heart
Well, nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now
My heart, my heart
Nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now


Well, there's broken silence
By thunder crashing in the dark (Crash in the dark)
And this broken record
Spin endless circles in the bar (Spin 'round in the bar)
This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
Mmm, but nothing breaks like a heart
But nothing breaks like a heart
Mmm, but nothing breaks like a heart
