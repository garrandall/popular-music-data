When I get restless, what can I do?
When I need someone I think about you
I got to move on, not fade away
I'm only just growing a little each day


(Hold it) I got to quit this runnin' 'round
(Hold it) Never gonna get rid of these blues
(Hold it) I got to find somebody to love
Slow me down, yeah
My, what a time (Look out now)

Sit yourself down, take a look around
Sit yourself down, take a look around
Sit yourself down, take a look around
Sit yourself down, take a look around
When I get older, mellowed down
Get myself settled on a patch of ground
Takin' it easy, live everyday
Me and the raven, we make our way



Sit yourself down, take a look around
