You could have given me a million reasons why
But it wouldn't change a thing
You said it all when you said goodbye
And you took off your wedding ring

I've been tryin' to get over you
I've been spending time alone
I've been tryin' to get over you
But it'll take dyin' to get it done

All my friends keep tryin' to fix me up
They say I need somebody new
When it comes to love, I've all but given up
'Cause life don't mean nothin' without you

I've been tryin' to get over you
I've been spending time alone
I've been tryin' to get over you
But it'll take dyin' to get it done
