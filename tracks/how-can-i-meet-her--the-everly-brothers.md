She's the prettiest girl in town and she sure knows it
The way she walks and the way she talks sure shows it
I hate that stuck-up so-and-so
But there's one thing I gotta know
Where does she live, what's her number and
How can I meet her?

She comes on like she's so high-classed and well-bred
But I never saw a girl with such a swelled head
She's got herself a mighty long wait
If she thinks I'll ask her for a date
But, where does she live, what's her number and
How can I meet her?

She's in love with herself; you know the kind
Always puttin' on airs

The guys in town all think she's a Mona Lisa
And she's got 'em all goin' out of their way to please her
Whatever they see's a mystery
'Cause she don't do a thing to me
But where 's she live, what's her number and
How can I meet her?

How can I meet her?
How can I meet her?
