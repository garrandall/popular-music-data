Don't get around much any
Don't get around much any
Don't get around much anymore

Missed the Saturday hop
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore
(Don't get around much anymore)

Thought I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore

Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless, why stir up memories

Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for
Awfully different without you
Don't get around much anymore
(Don't get around much anymore)

Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless, why stir up memories

Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for
Awfully different without you
Don't get around much anymore
(Don't get around much anymore)

Don't get around much anymore
(Don't get around much anymore)
Don't get around much anymore
(Don't get around much anymore)
Don't get around much anymore
(Don't get around much anymore)...
