Something's wrong, things aren't right
And it turns into a silly fight
You walk out, I get mad
And we both just end up feeling bad

Through the heat of the fire
And the trouble that we're going through
There's no harm, there's no danger
Because our love is really tried and true

And I want you here beside me, I need you
'Cause nobody's going to love me the way that you do
Baby, won't you come and hold me, hold me in your arms?
Didn't tell you that I need you?

I need you by my side
And although we're gonna fight sometimes
I need you by my side
Please don't walk away and we'll be fine

Through the heat of the fire
And the trouble that we're going through
There's no harm, there's no danger
Because our love is really tried and true

And I want you here beside me, I need you
'Cause nobody's going to love me the way that you do
Baby, won't you come and hold me, hold me in your arms?
Didn't tell you that I need you?

I, I need you, oh, oh
I need you, yes, I do

Through the heat of the fire
And the trouble that we're going through
There's no harm, there's no danger
Because our love is really tried and true

I need you by my side
And although we're gonna fight sometimes
I need you by my side
Please don't walk away and we'll be fine

You know I need you
You know I want you
I got to have you by my side (repeat and fade)
