What's the time?
Seems it's already morning
I see the sky
It's so beautiful and blue
The TV's on
But the only thing showing is a picture of you

Oh, I get up
And make myself some coffee
I try to read a bit
But the story's too thin
I thank the Lord above
That you're not there to see me in the shape I'm in

Spending my time
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small
I stare at the wall
Hoping that you think of me too
I'm spending my time

I try to call
But I don't know what to tell you
I leave a kiss
On your answering machine
Oh, help me please
Is there someone who can make me wake up from this dream?

Spending my time
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small
I stare at the wall
Hoping that you are missing me too

I'm spending my time
Watching the sun go down
I fall asleep to the sound
Of "tears of a clown"
A prayer gone blind

I'm spending my time

My friends keep telling me,
"Hey, life will go on!"
Time will make sure I get over you
"This silly game of love you play: you win only to lose."

I'm spending my time
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small
I stare at the wall
Hoping that you think of me too

I'm spending my time
Watching the sun go down
I fall asleep to the sound
Of "tears of a clown"
A prayer gone blind

I'm spending my time

Spending my time
I can't live without your love

Spending my time
I'm spending my time, my time, my time
Best to be without you honey, honey

Spending my time
