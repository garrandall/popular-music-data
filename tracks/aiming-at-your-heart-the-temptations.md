Tell me how you been
Well, it's so good to be seein' you again
Lady, you're so fine
I wish there was a way I could share your time

I need someone in my life
'Cause I'm lonely, yeah, for your lovin'
You make me feel so alive
You're the woman and nobody else will do

That's why I'm aimin' at your heart, aimin'
Aimin' at your heart, aimin', aimin'
Aimin' at your heart, aimin'
Aimin' at your heart

Why don't you love me, don't be shy
Like the wings of an eagle, let your feelings fly
Precious shinin' star
Do I need me a rocket to be where you are

I need someone in my life
'Cause I'm lonely for your lovin'
Ooh, girl, you make me feel so alive
You're the woman and nobody else would do

That's why I'm aimin' at your heart, aimin'
Aimin' at your heart, aimin', aimin'
Aimin' at your heart, aimin'
Aimin' at your heart

Aimin' at your heart
