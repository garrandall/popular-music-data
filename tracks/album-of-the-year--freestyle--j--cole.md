Album of the year on the way
Dax

Album of the year droppin'
No hate to J but I'm cold so I got it hot like the summertime out in pure Harlem
Rap but I'm still ballin'
I'm givin' niggas the buckets, I'm bangin' bitches, I been the best but I ain't chartin'
They say a nigga got Kardashian flow
Bars thick, make these niggas throw they cash at the rope
Smack, it's ten K and a laxative bro
'Cause I been shittin' on you niggas since I passed in the door
It's crazy, the flow addictive like the crack in the eighties
They bitin' styles, rap infective like it's written in rabies
I'm searchin' files, niggas fake and they was never the baby
'Cause I'm the realest rapper poppin' out vaginas from shady
Cole, yeah you have to hear me
The way I'm rappin' got these niggas scared
So they call me God 'cause they have to fear me
Fuck it, just ask Siri
She'll tell you I already make double than what signed niggas make yearly
Ayy Siri, how much I make a year?
Dax makes more than 90% of signed rappers yearly
Bitch so clearly, I'ma have these niggas shook
I went to college and I finished, man I could've wrote the book
That you was tellin' niggas pick up, but where we from, we can't bend our head
We might get shot when a nigga come for the stick up, so the
Vocabulary could probably be enhanced
But I ain't riskin' havin' niggas come watchin' out, understand
'Cause what I'm rappin' so much deeper than provin' another man
The education I received was just first nad not second hand, so me
Grab my gang, learn the ropes, feel like Pac and Biggie
Yeah I fuck with mumble rap 'cause mumble rap ain't fuckin' with me
Call up 50, he'll say it ain't a lie
He'll call me pussy 'cause he know I got nine lives
Times five, eyes wide, yeah my shit cross eyes
So when I rap I can see both sides, they lie, they try
Tellin' me I couldn't be a maverick
Was a janitor before I got established
Wanna know what happened, I got sick of the chains that they had me latched in
So I broke 'em, got myself in rappin'
They ain't with the action, applause if they clappin'
Only time they fire shots is if they throw 'em in the caption
If we really talkin' fabrics, I'm silk, they cotton
Niggas always pickin' niggas at the bottom
Why? so when they blow they can remind 'em how they got 'em
And that anything they started could be finished if they stop 'em
So Cole, I don't know if this'll reach you
But if it do, and you hungry, boy my bars finna feed you
So before your bars send 'em to hell
Let my bars take these trash niggas, throw 'em in jail
Let my bars cop a deal, let me sign to the 'Ville
Man it used to be a dream but it's startin' to feel real
Hah, it's Dax
