It don't come easy, that's understood
Faint hearted loser, that's no good
Just take a lesson from the great Mohammed
He said, he said

Pick up a rifle, you must be strong
To take a title can be so long
If you believe, you can't go wrong
I said, I said (listen)

He's a fighter, he's my friend
Always winning in the end
He's no angel, he's no fool
Never plays it by the rule
Take the glory, steal the prize
Only the hunter
Only the hunter

You took your chances, you hurt your pride
A sense of failure is hard to hide
You crossed the limit, you broke the code
Back on the road, remember?

He's a rival, he's my friend
Always winning in the end
He's a tiger, he's a swan
He's the one I'm counting on
To take the glory, steal the prize
Only the hunter
Only the hunter survives

I'm on the outside, I'm looking in
Through the lenses then into film
I've got the target set in my sights
I see a vision of truth, look out

We're gonna fight until we drop
We're gonna get back to the top
We're gonna be the first in line
Winners 'til the end of time
Only the hunter
Only the hunter
Survives
