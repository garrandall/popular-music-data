Oh!

Will you risk your reputation?
I don't know
You just don't know what you're sayin' anymore
You know beggars can't be choosers
And that's fair
When we win, we may be losers
I don't care. No, no, no

Baby, I just can't stand another lonely night
So come over and save me
Save me from another lonely night

I hear every word you're sayin'
They're all lies
But with every breath you're takin'
You're thinkin' of ways to say good night
Oh, oh, oh

Baby, I just can't stand another lonely night
So come over and save me
Save me from another lonely night
Yeah
Alright

Baby, I just can't stand another lonely night
So come over and save me
Uh, uh, uh
Baby, I just can't stand another lonely night
So come over and save me
Baby, I just can't stand it
Another lonely, another lonely night
Yeah. Ah, ah, oh

Baby, I just can't stand another lonely night
So come over and save me
Save me from another lonely night
Oh

Oh, save me
Save me
Yeah
Another lonely, lonely night
Oh, save me
I'm so lonely. Eh, eh
