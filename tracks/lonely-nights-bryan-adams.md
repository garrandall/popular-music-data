Will you risk your reputation?
I don't know
You just don't know what you're sayin'
Anymore
You know beggars can't be choosers
And that's fair
When we win, we may be losers
I don't care, no no no

Oh baby, I just can't stand another lonely night
So come over and save me
Save me from another lonely night

I hear every word you're sayin'
They're all lies
But with every breath you're takin'
You're thinkin' of ways to say good night

Oh now baby, I just can't stand another lonely night
So come over and save me
Save me from another lonely night, yeah

Baby, I just can't stand another lonely night
So come over and save me, oh

Baby, I just can't stand another lonely night
So come over and save me, oh
Baby, I just can't stand another lonely, another lonely night, oh, yeah

Baby, I just can't stand another lonely night
So come over and save me
Save me from another lonely night, oh

Oh save me, save me...
Another lonely night, I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely, yeah...
