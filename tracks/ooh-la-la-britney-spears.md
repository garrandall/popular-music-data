You don't have to look like a movie star
Ooh I think you're good just the way you are
Tell me if you could would you up and run away with me?

You don't have to roll like a millionaire
Baby I would go with you anywhere
We don't need no gold, we'll be shining anyway, you'll see

You know can't nobody get down like us
We don't stop 'til we get enough
C'mon, turn it up 'til the speakers pop
Break it down, show me what you've got

Ooh my my baby don't be shy
I see that spark flashing in your eye
My heart beats fast 'cause I want it all
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la

Take my hand, we can go all night
And spin me round just the way I like
It feels so good, I don't wanna stop
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la

You don't have to wear no designer clothes
Just as long as we're dancing on the floor
Fingers in my hair and I'm letting go tonight, so free

You know can't nobody get down like us
We don't stop 'til we get enough
C'mon, turn it up 'til the speakers pop
Break it down, show me what you've got

Ooh my my baby don't be shy
I see that spark flashing in your eye
My heart beats fast 'cause I want it all
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la

Take my hand, we can go all night
And spin me round just the way I like
It feels so good, I don't wanna stop
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la

Be my oh la la 

Ooh my my baby don't be shy
I see that spark flashing in your eye

Ooh my my baby don't be shy
I see that spark flashing in your eye
My heart beats fast 'cause I want it all
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la

Take my hand, we can go all night
And spin me round just the way I like
It feels so good, I don't wanna stop
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la

Baby come with me and be my ooh la la
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la
