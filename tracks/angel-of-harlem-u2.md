It was a cold and wet December day
When we touched the ground at JFK
Snow was melting on the ground
On BLS I heard the sound
Of an angel

New York, like a Christmas tree
Tonight this city belongs to me
Angel

Soul love...this love won't let me go
So long...angel of Harlem

Birdland on fifty-three
The street sounds like a symphony
We got John Coltrane and a love supreme
Miles says she's got to be an angel

Lady Day got diamond eyes
She sees the truth behind the lies
Angel

Soul love...this love won't let me go
So long...angel of Harlem
Angel of Harlem

She says it's heart...heart and soul...
Yeah yeah...(yeah)
Yeah yeah...(right now)

Blue light on the avenue
God knows they got to you
An empty glass, the lady sings
Eyes swollen like a bee sting
Blinded you lost your way
Through the side streets and the alleyway
Like a star exploding in the night
Falling to the city in broad daylight
An angel in Devil's shoes
Salvation in the blues
You never looked like an angel
Yeah yeah...angel of Harlem

Angel...angel of Harlem...
