I love you, yes, I do
I want you, yes, I do
I know you know it's true
From the way I looked at you
You love me, yes, you do
You need me, I need you
That's why I'm never blue
Since I first laid eyes on you
I guess you knew it from the start
From the day you took my heart
You're the one girl I'll always admire
Darling, you're my guiding star
I must be wherever you are
You set my world on fire
I miss you, yes, I do
Must hug you, kiss you too
I'm yours my whole life through
I love you, yes, I do
I love you, yes, I do
