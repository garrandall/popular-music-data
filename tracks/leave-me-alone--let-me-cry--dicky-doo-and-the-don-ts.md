Every time you told me
That you loved me
You were telling me another lie

Don't come around no more
And say you love me
Just leave me alone and let me cry

You were telling lies
So you could kiss me
When you had enough
You said goodbye

Don't come around no more
And say you miss me
Just leave me alone and let me cry

There will come a day
When you'll be lonely
There will come a day
You'll sit and sigh

There will come a day
You'll want me only
But I'll leave you alone
And let you cry

Leave you alone and let you cry
Leave you alone and let you cry
