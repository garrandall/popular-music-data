Alright

Yeah it's been a bumpy road
Roller-coasters high and low
Fill the tank and drive the car
Pedal fast, pedal hard
You won't have to go that far

You wanna give up 'cause it's dark
We're really not that far apart

So let your heart, sweetheart
Be your compass when you're lost
And you should follow it wherever it may go
When it's all said and done
You can walk instead of run
'Cause no matter what you'll never be alone
Never be alone
Never be alone

Forgot directions on your way
Don't close your eyes, don't be afraid
We might be crazy late at night
I can't wait 'til you arrive
Follow stars, you'll be alright

You wanna give up 'cause it's dark
We're really not that far apart

So let your heart, sweetheart
Be your compass when you're lost
And you should follow it wherever it may go
When it's all said and done
You can walk instead of run
'Cause no matter what you'll never be alone 
Never be alone
Never be alone

You wanna give up 'cause it's dark
We're really not that far apart

One, two, three

So let your heart, sweetheart
Be your compass when you're lost
And you should follow it wherever it may go
When it's all said and done
You can walk instead of run
'Cause no matter what you'll never be alone 
Never be alone
Never be alone

When it's all said and done
You can walk instead of run
'Cause no matter what you'll never be alone
