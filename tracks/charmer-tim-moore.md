There's a girl
Who's as sweet as the summer sky
She comes on like a rose
But she'll leave you hypnotized

You might say that she's hip
To the ways of the gypsy mind
But if you think you're the love of her life
Well baby, you're blind

That's why they call her

Charmer
Charmer comes on so steep, yeah
Charmer
Charmer with her eyes so deep
If she gets a foot inside your door
Baby, then it's all over
Jot down another score
One more for charmer

Just like a child
Like a jewel sparklin' in your hand
Just one kiss from her lips
Makes you feel like a man

Just one sigh from the depths of her eyes
Makes you melt away
Then you feel awfully weak on your feet
And you start to sway

That's why they call her

Charmer
Charmer comes on so steep, yeah
Charmer
Charmer with her eyes so deep
If she gets a foot inside your door
Baby, then it's all over
Jot down another score
One more, for

Charmer
Charmer comes on so steep, yeah
Charmer
Charmer with her eyes so deep...
