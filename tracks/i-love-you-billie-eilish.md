It's not true
Tell me I’ve been lied to
Crying isn't like you, oh
What the hell did I do?
Never been the type to
Let someone see right through, oh


Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn’t mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, oh


Up all night on another red-eye
I wish we never learned to fly
Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
Didn't mean to make you cry


Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, oh


The smile that you gave me
Even when you felt like dying


We fall apart as it gets dark
I'm in your arms in Central Park
There's nothing you could do or say
I can’t escape the way I love you
I don’t want to, but I love you, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
