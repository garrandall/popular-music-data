(Hey)
Well, I've been a-working hard the whole week long
And I'm a-gonna have some wine, women and song
I gotta work next week but that's alright
I've got five dollars and it's Saturday night

A music and dancin', flirtin' and fun
It's gonna go on until way past one
I'm a-gonna go where the lights are bright
I've got five dollars and it's Saturday night

I'm gonna have fun tonight
Gonna get right tonight
Everything will be alright
'Cause tonight is Saturday night. (hey.)

Well, other folks worry what the future may bring
I'm gonna have fun and not worry about a thing
My pants are ragged but that's alright
I've got five dollars and it's Saturday night

A-music and dancin', flirtin' and fun
It's gonna go on until way past one
I'm a gonna go where the lights are bright
I've got five dollars and it's Saturday night

Gonna have fun tonight
Gonna get right tonight
Everything will be alright
Tonight is Saturday night. (hey.)

Let other folks worry what the future may bring
I'm gonna have fun and not worry about a thing
My pants are ragged but that's alright
I've got five dollars and it's Saturday night...
