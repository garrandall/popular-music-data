I wanna find somebody to care
I wanna catch some rice in my hair
I need love and I want you, I do
I wanna spend my life loving you

Rice is nice, that's what they say
Rice is nice, throw some my way
Rice is nice on any day
Twice as nice when violins play

If I decide to walk beside you
Can I depend on your love staying true?
And when I get older and wrinkles appear
Will I still find some rice in my hair?

Rice is nice, that's what they say
Rice is nice, throw some my way
Rice is nice on any day
Twice as nice when violins play

Rice is nice, that's what they say
Rice is nice, throw some my way
Rice is nice on any day
Twice as nice when violins play
