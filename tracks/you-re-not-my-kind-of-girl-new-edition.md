Sorry
Ooh, yeah (You’re very pretty)
*stutter* Sorry
Woo, ooh, yeah, yeah


Oh, girl, I know that you're attracted to me
And I should feel the same about you
But there's something wrong
I don't know what it is
That keeps us from becoming a two


It's not your looks (You're very pretty)
It's not your style (The way you dress is oh so fresh)
It's not the way that you carry yourself


Oh, girl, I'm (sorry)
You're not my (kind of girl)
‘Cause you're the kind of girl that a man's dreams are made of
Oh, girl, I'm (sorry)
You're not my (kind of girl)
‘Cause you're the kind of girl that a man would be proud to call his own


Girl, you're so pretty
I wouldn't change a thing about you
But I've been in love before
So I know how it feels
The chemistry just isn't there


It's not your looks (You're very pretty)
It's not your style (The way you dress is oh so fresh)
It's not the way that you carry yourself


Oh, girl, I'm (sorry)
You're not my (kind of girl)
‘Cause you're the kind of girl that a man's dreams are made of
Oh, girl, I'm (sorry)
You're not my (kind of girl)
‘Cause you're the kind of girl that a man would be proud to call his own
(Sorry) You're not my (kind of girl)
‘Cause you're the kind of girl that a man's dreams are made of
Oh, girl, I'm (sorry)
You're not my (kind of girl)
‘Cause you're the kind of girl that a man would be proud to call his own


Man, I don’t know what’s wrong with that brother
You know what I’m saying, Mike?
On the serious tip, I think the girl is pretty fly
You too, Ron?
Yeah
I think he’s just buggin’, man
Yo, if I had it, I know what I’d do with it?
But if you had it, what would you do?


(Oh, girl, I’m sorry)
I’m not tryna put you down (Kind of girl)
But you’re just not that girl
(Kind of girl, oh girl, I...)
And even though you’re not my kind (Kind of girl)
You’re still so fine
Oh, girl, I’m sorry


I’m sorry
You’re not my...
Kind of girl; you’re so pretty
Oh, girl, I’m (Sorry)
I wish you were my…
My kind of girl
You’re the kind of girl that a man would be proud…
(Oh, girl, I’m sorry) …to call his own
(Kind of girl…oh, oh)
Sorry, woo!
(Sorry)
You’re not my...
(Kind of girl)
You’re not my…you’re not my, you’re not my, you’re not my kind
(Oh, girl, I'm sorry)
Oh, no (Kind of girl)
You’re not my…you’re not my, you’re not my, you’re not, you’re not my kind
(Sorry) I’m sorry, baby
(Kind of girl…oh, oh, oh, uh-oh)
