Four letter word just to get me along
It's a difficulty and I'm bitin' on my tongue
And I, I keep stallin' and keepin' it together
People around gotta find somethin' to say now
Holdin' back everyday the same
Don't wanna be a loner
Listen to me, oh no
I never say anything at all
But with nothin' to consider they forget my name (ame, ame, ame)

They call me hell
They call me Stacey
They call me Her
They call me Jane

That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name

They call me quiet
But I'm a riot
Mary-Jo-Lisa
Always the same

That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name

I'll miss the catch if they throw me the ball
I'm the last chick standing up against the wall
Keep fa-fallin', these heels that keep me borin'
Getting clamped up and sittin' on the fence now
So alone all the time and I lock myself away
Listen to me, oh no
And though I'm dressed up out and all
With everything considered they forget my name (ame, ame, ame)

They call me hell
They call me Stacey
They call me her
They call me Jane

That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name

They call me quiet
But I'm a riot
Mary-Jo-Lisa
Always the same

That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name

Are you callin' me darlin'?
Are you callin' me bird?
Are you callin' me darlin'?
Are you callin' me bird?

They call me hell
They call me Stacey
They call me her
They call me Jane

That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name

They call me quiet
But I'm a riot
Mary-Jo-Lisa
Always the same

That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name

They call me hell
They call me Stacey
They call me her
They call me Jane

That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name

They call me quiet
But I'm a riot
Mary-Jo-Lisa
Always the same

That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name

They call me hell
They call me Stacey
They call me her
They call me Jane

That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name

So alone all the time and I lock myself away
Though I'm dressed up out and all
With everything considered they forget my name
