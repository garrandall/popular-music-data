Fall in love
Why can't you fall in love
You need someone to love
Someone who really cares

And when you're feeling down
And when you're feeling low
You can reach out for me
You've got somewhere to go

All of my love
Baby you've got it
All of my love
You can't do without it
Just say the word
Darling I will be there

I saw you toss a coin
Into the good luck pond
Maybe somehow I knew
You needed someone

So when you're feeling down
And when you're feeling low
You can reach out for me
You've got somewhere to go

All of my love
Baby you've got it
All of my love
You can't do without it
Just say the word
Darling I will be there
