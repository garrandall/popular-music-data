Delta Dawn
What's that flower you have on?
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say
He was meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky

She's forty-one
And her daddy still calls her baby
All the folks round Brownsville say she's crazy
Cause she walks downtown
With her suitcase in her hand
Looking for a mysterious dark haired man

In her younger days
They called her Delta Dawn
Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on
Then a man of low degree
Stood by her side
Promised her he'd take her for his bride

Delta Dawn
What's that flower you have on?
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say
He was meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky

Delta Dawn
What's that flower you have on?
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say
He was meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky

Delta Dawn
What's that flower you have on?
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say
He was meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky

Delta Dawn
What's that flower you have on?
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say
He was meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky
