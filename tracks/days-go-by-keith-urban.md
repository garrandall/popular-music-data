Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah


I'm changing lanes and talking on the phone
I'm driving way too fast
And the interstate's jammed with gunners like me
Afraid of coming in last
But somewhere in the race we run
We're coming undone


Days go by
I can feel them flying
Like a hand out the window in the wind
As the cars go by
Yeah, it's all we've been given
So you better start living right now
'Cause days go by, oh, oh oh


Out on the roof just the other night
I watched the world flash by
Headlights, taillights running through a river of neon signs
But somewhere in the rush I felt
We're losing ourselves


Days go by
I can feel them flying
Like a hand out the window in the wind
As the cars go by
Yeah, it's all we've been given
So you better start living right now
And days go by, oh, oh oh
Yeah, the days go by, oh, oh oh


We think about tomorrow, then it slips away
Oh, yes it does
We talk about forever but we've only got today


And the days go by
I can feel them flying
Like a hand out the window
As the cars go by
It's all we've been given
So you better start living
You better start living
Better start living right now


'Cause days go by
I can feel them flying
Like a hand out the window in the wind
The cars go by
Yeah, it's all we've been given
So you better start living right now
'Cause days go by, oh, oh oh
Yeah, 'cause days go by, oh, oh oh


Oh, so take them by the hand
They're yours and mine
Take them by the hand
And live your life
Take them by the hand
Don't let them all fly by
Come on, come on now
Yeah, come on, oh, oh oh
Don't you know the days go by?
