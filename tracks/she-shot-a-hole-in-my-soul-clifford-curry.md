Oh
Oh
She shot a hole in my soul
I'm walkin' around the town
Callin' her name and tryin' to find her
She shot a hole in my soul
I'm walkin' all over town
Knockin' and beatin' on every door

Some pity me
Some people start to cry
One man said he'd help me
But I'm thinking he said goodbye

But I've got to keep on tryin' lord
I'm goin' crazy 'bout to lose my mind
I've got to keep on tryin', yeah
I'm goin' crazy 'bout to lose my mind

My heart said, without a love you're dying
Baby baby baby, can't you hear me crying
Saying

Oh
Oh
Help me somebody

I walked into a club
Jumped up and grabbed a microphone
Asked the man leading the band
To let me sing my song

My heart says, without a love you're dying
Baby baby baby, can't you hear me crying
Saying

Oh
C'mon y'all
Oh
She shot a hole in my soul
I'm goin' crazy 'bout to lose my mind
She shot a hole in my soul
I'm walkin' all over town
Callin' her name and tryin to find her
She shot a hole in my soul
I'm goin' crazy 'bout to lose my mind
