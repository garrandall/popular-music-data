Left a good job in the city
Working for the man ev'ry night and day
Then I never lost a minute of sleep
When I was worrying 'bout the way that things
Might have been

Big wheels keep on turning
Proud Mary keeps on burning
Rolling
Rolling
Rolling on the river

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city

Till I hitched a ride on a river boat queen

Big wheels keep on turning
Proud Mary keeps on burning
Rolling
Rolling
Rolling on the river
Rolling
Rolling
Rolling on the river
...

If you come down to the river
Betcha gonna find the people who live
You don't have to worry though you have no money
People on the river are happy to give

Big wheels keep on turning
Proud Mary keeps on burning
Rolling
Rolling
Rolling on the river
Rolling
Rolling
Rolling on the river...
