I Guess The Weekend's Over Now, And You'll Have To Make Your
Way (Have To Make Your Way)
We Had A Ball Of Dynomite, Right From The First Day (From The
First Day)
You Tell Me That You'll Call Me Just As Soon As You Get Home
To Pacify My Heart While I'm Alone
I Don't Like Bein' Alone

The Things We Did This Time My Love, We've Never Done Before
(Never Done Before)
You've Made Some Changes In My Head, I Don't Feel The Same
No More (Feel The Same No More)
Tell Me It's Not Make Believe, This Feeling That You've Shown
To Comfort Me My Love While I'm Alone
I Don't Like Bein' Alone

Doo Doo Doo
Doo Doo
Doo Doo Doo
Doo Doo

Doo Doo Doo
Doo Doo

Just Think The Times You Left Before, And Me Burnin' Up Inside
(Burnin' Up Inside)
Somethin' I Can't See No More, Not From My Foolish Pride (From
My Foolish Pride)
Please Be With Me Honey, All The Times When You're Not Home
To Pacify My Heart While I'm Alone
I Don't Like Bein' Alone

Hey Hey I Don't Like It
Bein' Alone
I Can't Stand It
Bein' Alone
Aw Baby
Aw Baby Babe Baby
Hey-E-Ay-E-Ay-E-Ay-E-Ay-E-Ay-E-Hey...Lah...Lah
Doo Doo Doo
Doo Doo
Alright Now, Baby
Oh I Miss You, Baby
All The Time, You Know I Don't Like Bein' All Alone, Baby
Oh
Baby Baby...
