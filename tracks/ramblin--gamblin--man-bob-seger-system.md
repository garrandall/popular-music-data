Yeah, I'm gonna tell my tale come on
A come on, a give a listen
'Cause I was born lonely down by the riverside
Learned to spin fortune wheels, and throw dice

I was just thirteen when I had to leave home
Knew I couldn't stick around, I had to roam
Ain't good looking, but you know I ain't shy
Ain't afraid to look it girl, hey hear me out
So if you need some lovin', and you need it right away
Take a little time out, and maybe I'll stay

But I got to ramble (Ramblin' man)
Gamble (Gamblin' man)
Got to got to ramble (Ramblin' man)
I was born a ramblin' (Gamblin' man)

Yeah, Uh-uh
Say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hah, hah, a bring it on, come on now

Yeah alright here we go now now

I'm out of money, 'cause you know I need some
Ain't gonna run on lovin', and I must run
Gotta keep movin', never gonna slow down
You can have your funky world, see you 'round

'Cause I gotta ramble (Ramblin' man)
Oh Lord, I gotta gamble (Gamblin' man)
Yeah, I gotta ramble (Ramblin' man)
Lord I'm a ramblin' (Gamblin' man)

Oh, I'm just a rambler
Yeah, yeah I'm just a gambler
Come on and sing along
'Cause I'm just a rambler (Ramblin' man)
Yeah, Lord, I'm a gambler (Gamblin' man)
Yeah, rambler (Ramblin' man)
Yeah, I'm a gambler (Gamblin' man)
A rambler (Ramblin' man)
