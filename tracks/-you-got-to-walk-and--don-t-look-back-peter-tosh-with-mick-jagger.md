If it's love that you're running from
There is no hiding place
Just your problems, no one else's problems
Could just have to face
If you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna lay all our troubles behind
We're gonna walk and don't look back
Gonna walk and don't look back
Now if your first love has let you down
There's something can be done
Don't you have your faith in love
Remembering what been gone
So if you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna lay all our troubles behind
Gonna walk and don't look back
We're gonna walk and don't look back
If you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna lay all our troubles behind
We're gonna walk and don't look back
Gonna walk and don't look back
Places behind you
There to remind you
If your first love have broke your heart
There's something can be done
Don't have your faith in love
Remembering what's been gone
But if you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna lay all our troubles behind
Gonna walk and don't look back
We're gonna walk and don't look back
