Yeah
(Do it, no hands, yeah)
(Do it, no hands, damn)
(They really wanna keep us outside)
('Cause you know we go way too live)

Whippin' again
Whippin' it, whippin' it, whippin' it again, yeah
Back at it again
Back at it, back at it, back at it again
All winter, all summer
Range Rovers and black Hummers
Ain't go dumb, I went dumber
When it go down, don't go under

Whippin' again
Whippin' it, whippin' it, whippin' it again, yeah
Back at it again
Back at it, back at it, back at it again
All winter, all summer
Range Rovers and black Hummers
Ain't go dumb, I went dumber
When it go down, don't go under

Sell a bird KFC
There was twenty LLCs
âAlexa, play who played meâ
Just made a mill like Meek
Pick a side, no in-between
Roll a L with the winning team
She a King like Billie Jean
I want smoke, yeah, nicotine
Is you finer than Fashion Nova?
I wanna really see what's in them jeans
Is that a lace-front, real hair extension
Or just a quick weave?
I'm 'bout the S with the lines through 'em
Partition with the blinds pulled
Had a deal on the table from Arm & Hammer
I was gon' sign to 'em

Whippin' again
Whippin' again, once again, yeah
Out on the East
Park up the Benz on the sand, yeah
Skrrt off the block
Hittin' your crib, no advance, yeah
Rip off the shirt
Rip off the, rip off the, rip off the pants

Do it, no hands, yeah
Do it, no hands, damn
While we throw bands in
While we throw bands up
They really wanna keep us outside (Outside)
'Cause you know we go way too live (Too Live)
Too turnt up for your club (Too turnt up)
4AM, ain't fucked up

GLS 63 Benz
Yeah, it really depends
Yeah, I'm covered, I'm drenched
Wet floor signs, hope you don't slip
Yeah, my homie a Crip
Seafood and you is a shrimp 
Runnin' tall, you gon' need stilts (Tall)
Rap or Go to the League blimp
Hit a home-run off a bunt, yeah (Outta here)
She do whatever I want, yeah
I had the Maybach for five years
And still never sat in the front
I bought a designer lil' momma on Prada
And she got a body, pick her out a line-up
If she ever leave me, I'm coming to find her
Whippin' the kitchen like chef had katanas
Yeah

Back at it again
Whippin' again, once again, yeah
Out on the East
Park up the Benz on the sand, yeah
Skrrt off the block
Hittin' your crib, no advance, yeah
Rip off the shirt
Rip off the, rip off the, rip off the pants

Do it, no hands, yeah
Do it, no hands, damn
While we throw bands in
While we throw bands up
They really wanna keep us outside
'Cause you know we go way too live
Too turnt up for your club
4AM, ain't fucked up
Yeah

Whippin' again
Whippin' it, whippin' it, whippin' it again, yeah
Back at it again
Back at it, back at it, back at it again
All winter, all summer
Range Rovers and black Hummers
Ain't go dumb, I went dumber
When it go down, don't go under

Whippin' again
Whippin' it, whippin' it, whippin' it again, yeah
Back at it again
Back at it, back at it, back at it again
All winter, all summer
Range Rovers and black Hummers
Ain't go dumb, I went dumber
When it go down, don't go under
