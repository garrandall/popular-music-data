Yeah
Do it no hands, yeah, do it, no handstand
They really wanna keep us outside
'Cause you know we go way too live

Whippin' again, whippin'
And whippin' and whippin' again, yeah
Back at again, back at it,
Back at it, back at again
All winter, all summer
Range Rovers and black Hummers
Ain't go dumb, I went dumber
When it go down, don't go under (Yeah)
Whippin' again, whippin'
And whippin' and whippin' again, yeah
Back at it again, back at it,

When it go down, don't go under

Sell a bird, KFC (Bird)
And it was twenty LLC's (Yeah)

Just made a mil' like Meek (Alright)
Pick a side, no in-between
Roll an L with the winning team
She a king like Billie Jean (Billie)
I want smoke, yeah, nicotine (Smoke)
Is you finer than Fashion Nova?
I wanna really see what's in them jeans
Is that a lace-front real hair extension,
Or it's just a quick weave? (What?)
I'm 'bout the S with the lines through 'em
Partition with the blind's pulled
Had a deal on the table from
Arm & Hammer, I was gon' sign to 'em
Yeah

Back at it again, whippin'
Again, once again, yeah (Yeah)
Out on the East, park
Up the Benz, I'm the same, yeah (Yeah)
Skrrt off the block, hittin'
Your crib, no advance, yeah (Yeah)
Rip off the shirt,
Rip off the, rip off the, rip off the pants
Do it no hands, yeah,
Do it, no handstand
While we throw bands in,
While we throw bands up
They really wanna
Keep us outside (Outside)
'Cause you know
We go way too live (Too live)
Too turnt up for your club (Too turnt up)
4AM, ain't fucked up

GLE, 63 Benz

Yeah, I'm covered, I'm drenched
Wet floor signs, hope you don't slip
(Slip)
Yeah, my homie a Crip

Rap or Go to the League blimp, uh
Hit a home run off a bunt,

I had the Maybach for five years
I still never sat in the front, yeah

Llil' mama, I'm proud of her
She got a body, pick her out a lineup
She ever leave me,
I'm comin' to find her
Whip in the kitchen
