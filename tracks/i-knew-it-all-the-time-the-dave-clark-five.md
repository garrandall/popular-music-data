(Yeah, yeah)
I knew it all the time
(Yeah, yeah)
That you would leave me
(Yeah, yeah)

And you would go
And leave me cold
Yep, I knew it all the time
(Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah)

You left me high and dry
(Yeah, yeah)
And broken hearted
(Yeah, yeah)

We simply parted
And that was all
Yep, I knew it all the time
(Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah)

You came to me again
(Yeah, yeah)
You said you're sorry
(Yeah, yeah)

You learned your lesson
You cried your tears
(Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah)
