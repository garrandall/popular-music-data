I bet the derby and I won by a nose,
I bet Vegas and they took my clothes.
I bet Monte Carlo I was showin' my stuff,
I bet on you baby, now ain't that enough?

You got to give it up, 
Give it up baby.
Give it up.
You got to give it up, baby, tell me where it's at.

Well there's a few more things you should know about me,
I trained trigger single-handedly.
I invented see-through negligees,
And I bought the flying saucer off the Presley estate.

You got to give it up, 
You got to give it up baby.
Give it up.
You got to give it up, baby, tell me where it's at.

I fell in love down in Mexico,
Thunderbird wine's the only way to go.
I been in love ten thousand times, 
All you got to do is remember my line.
