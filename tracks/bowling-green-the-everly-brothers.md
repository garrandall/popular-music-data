Way down in Bowling Green 
Prettiest girls I've ever seen 
A man in Kentucky 
Sure is lucky 
To love down in Bowling Green

Bowling Green folks treat you kind 
They let you think your own mind 
A man in Kentucky 
Sure is lucky 
In Bowling Green you walk your own line

Kentucky sunshine makes the heart unfold 
It warms the body 
And I know it touches the soul 
Bluegrass is fine 
Kentucky owns my mind

The fields down in Bowling Green 
Have the softest grass I've ever seen 
A man in Kentucky 
Sure is lucky 
To lie down in Bowling Green

Bowling Green girls treat you right 
They wear dresses cut country tight 
A man in Kentucky 
Sure is lucky 
If he's seen a Bowling Green night

Kentucky sunshine makes the heart unfold 
It warms the body 
And I know it touches the soul 
Bluegrass is fine 
Kentucky owns my mind

Bowling Green, Bowling Green 
Bowling Green, Bowling Green

Bowling Green, Bowling Green 
Bowling Green, Bowling Green
