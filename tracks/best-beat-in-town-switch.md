We have a beat we made just for you to rock
With harmonies and our beats you won't stop


With fingers snappin', hands clapping
Drummer poppin', bassman pluckin'
Keyboards ringing, voices dinging
All these things it takes to make the best sound


Best beat in town, best beat all around
Best beat in town, best beat all around
Best beat in town, best beat all around
Best beat in town, best beat all around
Best beat in town, best beat all around

That's it, that's it, yeah
I think I got it now
Ha ha ha haa


From left to right from side to side
We'll rock the town
And one thing we'll keep in mind
Is the country sound

Don't you know we got the best beat
We got the best beat in town

Side to side left to right
Well well well well
We gonna rock the town
Said we're feeling good like we should
Yeah yeah yeah we got the best beat

With fingers snappin', hands clapping
Drummer poppin', bassman pluckin'
Keyboards ringing, voices dinging
Yeah yeah
