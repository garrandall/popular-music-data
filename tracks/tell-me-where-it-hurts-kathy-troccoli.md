Why is that sad look in your eyes
Why are you crying
Tell me now, tell me now
Tell me why you're feeling this way
I hate to see you so down
Oh, baby, is it your heart
Oh breaking all in pieces
Making you cry
Making you feel blue
Is there anything I can do

Why don't you
Tell me where it hurts now, baby
And I'll do my best to make it better
Yes, I'll do my best to make
The tears all go away
Just tell me where it hurts now, tell me
And I'll love you with a love so tender
And if you'll let me stay
I'll love all the hurt away

Where are all those tears coming from
Why are they falling
Did somebody, somebody
Somebody leave your heart in the cold
You just need somebody to hold
So baby, give me a chance
To put back all the pieces
Take your broken heart
Make it just like new
There's so many things that I can do

Why don't you
Tell me where it hurts now, baby
And I'll do my best to make it better
Yes, I'll do my best to make
The tears all go away
Just tell me where it hurts now, tell me
And I'll love you with a love so tender
Oh, and if you'll let me stay
I'll love all the hurt away

Oh I can make it go away, baby

Is it your heart
Oh breaking all in pieces
Making you cry
Making you feel blue
Is there anything I can do

Why don't you
Tell me where it hurts now, baby
And I'll do my best to make it better
Yes, I'll do my best to make
The tears all go away
Just tell me where it hurts now, tell me
And I'll love you with a love so tender
Oh, and if you'll let me stay
I'll take all the hurt away

Tell me, oh
Tell me, baby
Tell me, oh
And I'll do my best to make
The tears all go away
Just tell me where it hurts now, tell me
And I'll love you with a love so tender
Oh, and if you'll let me stay
I'll take all the hurt away
