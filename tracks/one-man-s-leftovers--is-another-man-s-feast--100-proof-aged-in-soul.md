Yum yum yummy
Got love for my tummy
Yum yum yummy
Got love from your honey


One man's leftovers
Is another man's feast
One man's leftovers
Is another man's feast

Like a one-eyed hungry cat
I watched your woman each day
Hoping you'd be fed up
And throw her love away

You found you someone else
And now I'm helping myself
Having myself a picnic
Loving the love you left



She sent her love to you
On a silver tray
You messed over her mind
And threw her love away

When she's in my arms
My appetite's fulfilled
She brings her love to me
Like a full course meal



Yum yum yummy
Got love for my tummy
Yum yum yummy
Got love from your honey



I'm feasting on the love
You let go to waste, oh
Having myself a picnic
Loving here in your place
