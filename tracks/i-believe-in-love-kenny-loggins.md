I see faces!
Coverin' an empty 'I'
Empty spaces
Where there used to be a soul inside

Nothin' and no one ever gets to them
Seems the wind could blow right through them
Believin' in gods that never knew them
I believe in love

I believe in love, I do!
I believe I'm feelin' good
I'm feeling love!
(Feeling love is feeling good)
I believe in love
Feeling love is feeling good!

Worry!
Climbin' up your money tree
You've got to hide it
Monkey do what the monkey see

You're on a one-way street and you're speedin'
Missin' the signs you should be readin'
That's the things you'll later be needin'
I believe in love

I believe it, nobody sold me
Always knew it, nobody told me
I believe in someone to hold me
I believe in love

I believe in love, I do!
I believe I'm feelin' good
I'm feeling love!
(Feeling love is feeling good)
(Feeling love is feeling good, I believe in love)
(Feeling love is feeling good)
I believe in love
(Feeling love is feeling good, I believe in love)
Feeling love is feeling good!
(I believe in love)
Feeling love is feeling good!
(I believe in love)

Oh, never be lonely!
Sleepin' in an empty bed
Shouldn't feel it, just a place to rest my head

But I don't want to find myself one day
Wakin' up and lookin' at Monday
With some 'whats-her-name' left from Sunday
I believe in love

I believe it, nobody sold me
Always knew it, nobody told me
I believe in someone to hold me
I believe in love

I believe in love, I do!
I believe I'm feelin' good
Everybody should!
I believe I'm feelin' good
Believe in it
Believe in, love!
