Oh baby, I don't know why
But somehow I always seem to get
Tangled up in my pride
Oh baby we're not that blind
Deep down inside you know
This love's worth one more try
Don't push it all aside


'Cause I wanna be good for you
Didn't mean to be bad
But darling, I'm still the best
That you ever had
Just give me a chance
To let me show you how much
I wanna give you my love touch, oh
I wanna give you my love touch, oh


Why can't I climb your walls
And find somewhere to hide?
Can't I knock down your door
And drag myself inside?
I'll light your candles, baby
And maybe I'll light your life
I wanna feel the breathless end
You come to every night
This ever-changing love
Is pushing me too far
I feel the need to reach you
Right now wherever you are
These empty arms are getting stronger every day
Believe me, baby, they won't let you get away
No, they won't let you get away


'Cause I wanna be good for you
Didn't mean to be bad
But darling, I'm still the best
That you ever had
Just give me a chance
To let me show you how much
I wanna give you my love touch, love touch, oh
You know it doesn't matter
Doesn't matter who's wrong
I think I'm gonna find out
If this love is strong
Just give me a chance
To win back your trust
I wanna give you my love touch
I wanna give you my love touch, oh


C'mon baby, try me out
I'll be good for you, ah!
Just watch me one time


Oh you're gonna get a, ohyou're gonna get a big love touch
Oh you're gonna get a, ohyou're gonna get a big love touch
Oh baby, baby
Oh I need you


Give me a chance
To let me show you how much
I wanna give you my love touch, oh
You know it don't matter
Who's right or who's wrong
Guess we're gonna find out
If this love is strong
Just give me a chance
To win back your trust
I wanna give you my love touch, love touch, love touch
I wanna give you my love touch, oh
Gotta give you my love touch


Oh you're gonna get a, oh you're gonna get a big love touch
I wanna give you my love touch
Oh you're gonna get a, oh you're gonna get a big love touch
Come on, baby, oh
Oh you're gonna get a, oh you're gonna get a big love touch
My love touch, my love touch, my love touch
Oh you're gonna get a, oh you're gonna get a big love touch
Baby, baby, baby, I need your love touch
Honey, honey, honey, I need some love touch
Oh you're gonna get a, oh you're gonna get a big love touch
