Pop a top, again.
I just got time for one more round.
Set em' up my friend.
Then I'll be gone;
And you can let some other fool sit down.

I'd like for you to listen to a joke I heard today
From a woman who said she was through and calmly walked away.
I tried to smile, and did a while; but it felt so outta place.
Did you ever hear of a clown with tear drops streaming down his face?

Pop a top, again.
I think I'll have another round.
Set em' up my friend.
Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down.

Home for me, is misery, and here I'm wasting time
Cause a row of fools on a row of stools is not what's on my mind.
But then you see her leaving me. It's not what I perfer.
So, it's either here just drinking beer or at home remembering her.

Pop a top, again.
I think I'll have another round.
Set em' up my friend.
Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down.
Pop a top, again.
