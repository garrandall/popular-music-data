Red, red wine goes to my head,
Makes me forget that I still need her so

Red, red wine, it's up to you
All I can do I've done
Memories won't go, memories won't go

Life is fine every time,
Thoughts of you leave my head
I was wrong, now I find
Just one thing makes me forget

Red, red wine, stay close to me
Don't let me be alone
It's tearing apart my blue heart

Red red wine, you make me feel so fine,
You keep me rockin' all of the time
Red red wine, you make me feel so grand,
I feel a million dollar when you're just in my hand
Red red wine, you make me feel so sad,
Any time I see you go, it make me feel bad
Red red wine, you make me feel so fine,
Monkey back and ease up on the sweet deadline

Red red wine, you give me holy pahzing
Holy pahzing, you make me do my own thing
Red red wine, you give me not awful love
Your kind of lovin' like a blessing from above
Red red wine, I loved you right from the start,
Right from the start, and with all of my heart
Red red wine in an eighties style
Red red wine in a modern beat style
Yeah

Give me a little time, let me clear out my mind
Give me a little time, let me clear out my mind
Give me red wine, the kind make me feel fine
You make me feel fine all of the time
Red red wine, you make me feel so fine
Monkey back and ease up on the sweet deadline
The line broke, the money get choked,
Bunbah, ganjapani, little rubber boat
Red red wine, I'm gonna hold on to you,
Hold on to you 'cause I know you love truth
Red red wine, I'm gonna love you till I die,
Love you till I die, and that's no lie
Red red wine, can't get your off my mind
Wherever you may be, I'll surely find,
I'll surely find. Make no fuss, just leave us
