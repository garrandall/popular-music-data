I don't know what you got
But it's gettin' to me
It makes my cold nights hot
Hot winds just blow right through me

Oh, power
Lady, it's in your hands

'Cause you got me hummin' now
You got me hummin' now

I wake up early at night
I can't go back to sleep now
Even walk in the red lights
Tired of talking, I try to sleep

Look here if I try to walk
That's when my feet start a runnin'

'Cause you got me hummin' now
You got me hummin' now

I don't know what you got
But it's gettin' to me
It makes my cold nights hot
Hot winds just blow right through me

Look here if I try to walk
That's when my feet start a runnin'

'Cause you got me hummin' now
You got me hummin' now
You got me hummin' now

You got me hummin', oh
You got me hummin', ohyeah
You got me hummin'
