Light a candle
Turn all the lights down low
Baby, let's just lose control, lose control
I can handle every single curve, you know
That I love you, let me show you, oh


Fall into me, let me breathe the air you breathe
I can take you anywhere you wanna be
When it comes to us every single touch is something special
When we're wrapped up in those sheets
Yeah, we're winning when we're losing
When we're losing sleep


Real life, when it's this good don't you know
We don't need to dream at all
Baby, so...


Fall into me, let me breathe the air you breathe
I can take you anywhere you wanna be
When it comes to us every single touch is something special
When we're wrapped up in those sheets
Yeah, we're winning when we're losing
When we're losing sleep

Fall into me, let me breathe the air you breathe
I can take you anywhere you wanna be, yeah
When it comes to us every single touch is something special
When we're wrapped up in those sheets
Yeah, we're winning when we're losing
When we're losing sleep
When we're losing sleep
Yeah, we're winning when we're losing


Light a candle
Turn all the lights down low
