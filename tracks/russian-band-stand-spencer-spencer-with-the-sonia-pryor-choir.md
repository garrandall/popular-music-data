Welcome to Russian Band Stand
Dis is your host, Nikita Clarkchev
In Russia almost everybody watches Russian Band Stand

Now everybody watches Russian Band Stand!
Heh, heh, heh

Next is number one song in Russia

(But we don't like that song!)
You got to like that song, it's number one song!
(But we don't like...)


Who else doesn't like that song?
(I don't like...)

(... any... other... song)
Too late, comrade!

Now, anybody else don't like?
(We like that song)
All right, now a word from our sponsor
You better listen!

Play that stroganoff, new schwachling cigarette
Each cigarette two puffs
That's all you got time for
Work twenty two hours a day, so cline
Is only cigarette with microphone filter
So be careful comrade, secret police are listening
Is only cigarette I smoke, right Comrade Mamarelichev?
Right, is only cigarette you can buy

Next on Russian Band Stand is country's number one singing star, Nikita Presleychev
What are you going to sing, Nikita?

No, that's wrong song

Tomorrow we have new number one singing star
Tomorrow we have new number one song

Hey comrade, we are secret police
Tomorrow we have new host on Russian Band Stand
