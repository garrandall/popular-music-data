A little bit of soap
Will wash away your lipstick from my face
A little bit of soap
Will never, never, never, ever erase
The pain in my heart, in my eyes
As I go through the lonely years
A little bit of soap
Will never wash away my tears

A little bit of soap
(Little bit of soap)
Will take away your powder from my chin
A little bit of soap
(Just a little)
Will never (just a little) never, never, ever begin
To take away the hurt that I feel
As I go through the lonely years
A little bit of soap
(Soap)
Will never wash away my tears

Have you heard when love begins to die
It leaves someone to cry night and day
Like a bird, who left the robin's nest
You're just like all the rest
You flew away

Oh, just a little bit of soap
(Little bit of soap)
Will take away (just a little) your perfume eventually
A little bit of soap
(Just a little)
Will never (just a little) take away the memory
Of your name in the night
As I go through the lonely years
(Just a little)
A little bit of soap
Will never wash away my tears

Oh, a little bit of soap
(Just a little)
(Little bit of)
Never, never
(Never wash away the tears)
(Just a little)
(Little bit of)
Soap
(Never wash away the tears)
Just a little
(Little bit of)
Never gonna
(Never wash away the tears)
(Just a little)
Just a little
(Little bit of)
(Never wash away the tears)
(Just a little)
Just a little bit of soap
