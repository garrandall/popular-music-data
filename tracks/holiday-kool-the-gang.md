Summer fun, work is over
Let your hair down, invade the beach town
Crystal Lake, where we like to play
Me and my baby, oh, our private getaway

One on one rockin' in the sun
Relaxation our vacation
Smiling faces when the children play
Well, it's so wonderful to have a holiday

Oh, those holidays we'll be dancing, loving, romancing
Holiday, let's celebrate holiday fun!

Top of the year, we all give a cheer
Horns blowin', tears are flowin'
Spring fever love is here to stay
And it's so wonderful to have a holiday

Oh, those holidays we'll be dancing, loving, romancing
Holiday, time to play, holiday fun, holiday
Let's celebrate holiday fun!

Time flies when you're having lots of fun
Before you know it, you're back on the run
So let's rejoice and let's give a cheer this holiday!
Time flies when you're having lots of fun

Holiday, let's celebrate holiday fun!
Holiday, time to play, holiday fun
Holiday, let's celebrate holiday fun!
Holiday, time to play, holiday fun
