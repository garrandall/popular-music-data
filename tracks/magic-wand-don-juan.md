I wish I had a magic wand
I would touch your arms
So they could hold me

Fairy tales don't come true
Oh, I wish I had you
Shooby dooby wah

I wish I had a magic wand
I would touch your lips
And you would kiss me

You would give me your heart
We could never, ever part

I wish I had
The powers of a lover
No rabbit's foot
No genies for me

I would throw away
My four leaf clover
I would leave it up to destiny

I wish I had a magic wand
You would be the
First one that I run to
You would love me like I love you
If I had a magic wand, ooh
