MONY POWR RSPT World, nigga
DrugRixh
Pablo Juan, nigga

They fucked up when they put Hect on sensei
Slept in the mud until I made a way
DrugRixh had to make a better way
Trapped in the bando with my nigga K
Long line, nigga, Chick-fil-A
Play with Hect, get shot in the face
Wrong move, nigga, get out the way
It's a MONY world, nigga, stay in your place
I cut the white girl like I'm OJ
I'm cooking up, serving fish filet
I swing my door with a dirty AK
I don't play games, gotta catch a play
Fuck around and make me catch a case
Eat a nigga's plate to say my grace
V12 engine, I don't wanna race
I'm still in the hood, nigga, every day


Get shot in the face by "he say, she say"
Just talked to buzzo and the Feds on three-way
Fuck nigga, try me, you know how we play
Everybody get hit when I shoot the K
Thank you, Allah, I beat another case
Got niggas that'll rob your ass dirty-faced
I'm from the hood, where it ain't safe
I'll kick down your door, I'm looking for the safe
Finna get a Maybach, fuck the wraith
Gun rack aimed at your face
Before you kiss her, you better make her use toothpaste
Pablo used the wand, cook it up like a magic plate


They fucked up when they put Hect on sensei
Slept in the mud until I made a way
DrugRixh had to make a better way
Trapped in the bando with my nigga K
Long line, nigga, Chick-fil-A
Play with Hect, get shot in the face
Wrong move, nigga, get out the way
It's a MONY world, nigga, stay in your place
I cut the white girl like I'm OJ
I'm cooking up, serving fish filet
I swing my door with a dirty AK
I don't play games, gotta catch a play
Fuck around and make me catch a case
Eat a nigga's plate to say my grace
V12 engine, I don't wanna race
I'm still in the hood, nigga, every day


Fucked around and served twelve niggas, got the hood hot
Hit you with a clean spoon, nigga with a dirty pot
Play with Hect, that's how the last nigga got shot
Sippin to much Hi-Tech, nigga got my heart stopped
Stay down on the block
Until I came up with a whole lot
Whip it good, Auntie say her jaw locked
Shoot craps in the parking lot
Whoop whoop
Said the block hot
BOW BOW the other shot
All of you bumboclaat
Glock 19 with a 30 shot


They fucked up when they put Hect on sensei
Slept in the mud until I made a way
DrugRixh had to make a better way
Trapped in the bando with my nigga K
Long line, nigga, Chick-fil-A
Play with Hect, get shot in the face
Wrong move, nigga, get out the way
It's a MONY world, nigga, stay in your place
I cut the white girl like I'm OJ
I'm cooking up, serving fish filet
I swing my door with a dirty AK
I don't play games, gotta catch a play
Fuck around and make me catch a case
Eat a nigga's plate to say my grace
V12 engine, I don't wanna race
I'm still in the hood, nigga, every day
