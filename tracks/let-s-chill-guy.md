Sweetheart I’ve been trying so hard to get over you, just simply can’t
‘Cause the love we shared through the years...Meant so much to me
All I’m looking for is just a serious relationship
Someone I can hold all my life
Why don’t you give me that commitment?
Let’s settle down, let’s chill
Don’t be afraid of me, I’m the one that is scared
But I promise everything will be alright
Come closer
Let me talk to you
Let’s chill


Ho, ho, baby, hey,hey
Let’s chill
(Let’s chill, baby)


From the first time.. I saw your face
Girl I knew I had to have you
I wanted to wrap you with my warm embrace, visions of your lovely face
All my love is for you, whatever you want I will do
You’re the only one I want in my life
For you I’ll make that sacrifice, ho


Let’s chill
And let’s settle down
(That’s what I wannna do)
That’s what I wanna do
(Just me and you)
Just me and you (Baby)
Let’s chill
(Let’s chill)
Let’s settle down
(Come here, baby)
That’s what I wanna do
(That’s all)
Just me and you


I’m so happy to have you here, standing right by my side
Is it a dream? or reality? (reality)
If it’s a fantasy, please don’t wake me
All my love is for you, whatever you want I will do
You’re the only one I want in my life
For you I’ll make that sacrifice, so baby let’s


Let’s chill
And let’s settle down
That’s what I wanna do
(That’s all I wanna do)
Just me and you
Just me and you (Baby)
Let’s chill
(Let’s chill, baby)
Let’s settle down
(Come here, baby)
That’s what I wanna do
(That’s all)
Just me and you


Come here baby
Come lay next to me
Let’s forget about the past and think about the future
Let’s get together baby
Let’s stay together


Ho, oh
Let’s chill, baby


Let’s chill
And let’s settle down
(That’s what I want)
That’s what I wanna do
(All in my mind)
Just me and you
(To be with you baby)
Let’s chill
(So let’s chill)
Let’s settle down
(Come here, baby)
That’s what I wanna do
(That’s all I want to do with you)
Just me and you


Forever and ever
Ever and ever
Ever and ever, always
Forever and ever
Ever and ever
Ever and ever, always
