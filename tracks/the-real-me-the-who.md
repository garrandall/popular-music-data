I went back to the doctor
To get another shrink
I sit and tell him about my weekend
But he never betrays what he thinks

Can you see the real me, doctor, doctor?
Can you see the real me, doctor?
Oh, doctor


I went back to my mother
I said, "I'm crazy Ma help me"
She said, "I know how it feels, son
'Cause it runs in the family"

Can you see the real me, mother, mother?
Can you see the real me, mother?
Oh, mama
Can you see the real me?
Can you see
Can you see the real me?
The real me, the real me


The cracks between the paving stones
Like rivers of flowing veins
Strange people who know me
Peeping from behind every window pane
The girl I used to love
Lives in this yellow house
Yesterday she passed me by
She doesn't want to know me now

Can you see the real me, can you, can you?
Can you see the real me, can you?
Oh yes


I ended up with the preacher
Full of lies and hate
I seemed to scare him a little
So he showed me to the golden gate

Can you see the real me, preacher, preacher?
Can you see the real me, preacher?


Can you see, can you see, can you see
Can you see the real me doctor
Can you see the real me mother
Can you see the real me me me me me...
