Stack my money fast and go (fast, fast, go)
Fast like a Lambo (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)

Have you ever seen the crowd goin' apeshit? (Offset!)

I'm a gorilla in the fuckin' coupe
Finna pull up in the zoo
I'm like Chief Keef meet Rafiki, who been lyin' "King" to you?
Pocket, watch it, like kangaroos
Tell these clowns we ain't amused
'Nana clips for that monkey business, 4-5 got change for you
Motor cade when we came through
Presidential with the planes too
One better get you with the residential
Undefeated with the cane too
I said no to the Superbowl, you need me, I don't need you
Every night we in the endzone, tell the NFL we in stadiums too
Last night was a fuckin' zoo
Stagedivin' in a pool of people
Ran through Liverpool like a fuckin' Beatle
Smoke gorilla glue like it's fuckin' legal
Tell the Grammy's fuck that 0 for 8 shit
Have you ever seen the crowd goin' apeshit? (Rah)

Stack my money fast and go (fast, fast, go)
Fast like my Lambo (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Jumpin' off the stage, ho (jumpin', jumpin', hey, hey)
Crowd better savor (crowd goin' ape, hey)
I can't believe we made it (this is what we made, made)
This is what we're thankful for (this is what we thank, thank)
I can't believe we made it (this a different angle)
Have you ever seen the crowd goin' apeshit? Rah!

Haters in danger (dangerous)
Whole lot of gangin' (gang)

She a thot that you claim (woo!)
Can't be toppin' my reign (c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
Poppin', I'm poppin', my bitches all poppin'
We go to the dealer and cop it all (cop it all)
Sippin' my favorite alcohol (alcohol)
Got me so lit, I need Tylenol (Tylenol)
All of my people, I free 'em all (free 'em all)
Hop in the whip, wanna see the stars
Sendin' the missiles off, drinkin' my inhibitions off
250 for the Richard Mille, yeah yeah, live in a field
My body make Jigga go kneel
Man, my momma, my Lord, my shield
Look at my jewelry, I'm lethal (lethal)
These diamonds on me, they see-through (see-through)
I'm a Martian, they wishin' they equal (equal)
I got M's on the back like Evisu

Gimme the paw, gimme the ball, take a top shift (she went crazy)
Call my girls and put 'em all on a spaceship
Hang one night with 'Yoncé, I'll make you famous
Have you ever seen the crowd goin' apeshit? Rah!

Stack my money fast and go (fast, fast, go)
Fast like a Lambo (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
