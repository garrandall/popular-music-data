(ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney)


Her ass out, she goin' places that you can't (Go!)
Call up her hoes and told 'em, "Bring 'em out the sleigh" (Brrr)
Fall, touch her toes, then I'm throwin' 50K (Hey!)
Splash brothers, whoa, we just landed in the Bay (Splash)

Look at the way that I be pushin' in that Hellcat
I was jumpin' out the gym in Nike Air Max
Three bad bitches in the coupe slidin' down Fairfax
Bitch, I been gettin' to this money, I can't dare cap
Look at the way that I been shinin', diamonds gleamin' (Uh)
Rich nigga, they know my name when I'm at Neiman (Uh)
Look at the way that I been ballin' every season (Uh)
Gotta chase the money, watch the whole team win


Look at me, bitch
Look at the way I carry myself
Look at the way I'm winnin'
Look at this liquid around my neck, look how they shimmerin'
Look at this strand I'm smokin', look at this bottle I'm holdin', look at my life
Look how I'm playin' the field like I'm rollin' the dice under casino lights (Uh)
Luxury automobiles and sports cars with loud pipes (Vroom!)
Detachable steering wheels, muscle cars, and scraper bikes
Some of my niggas push pills, some of 'em push that Cha Cha (Cha Cha)
Some of 'em work for a living to make an honest dollar (Honest dollar)
And here's another thing I thought that you should know (What?)
I'll make a ho stand outside forever like a scarecrow (Scarecrow)
I'm a Bay nigga, that's affirmative, ain't no arguin' (Uh-uh)
Nigga, you soft as table butter, margarine (Uh-huh)
I'm always intoxicated, I'm never sober
Same soup, just warmed over, a little wiser and older, but dangerous like a cobra
Not a Steeler but I bust just like Jerome Bettis (Bah!)
Money longer than the end of them action-packed movie credits (Bitch!)


Her ass out, she goin' places that you can't (Go!)
Call up her hoes and told 'em, "Bring 'em out the sleigh" (Brrr)
Fall, touch her toes, then I'm throwin' 50K (Hey!)
Splash brothers, whoa, we just landed in the Bay (Splash)

Look at the way that I be pushin' in that Hellcat
I was jumpin' out the gym in Nike Air Max
Three bad bitches in the coupe slidin' down Fairfax
Bitch, I been gettin' to this money, I can't dare cap
Look at the way that I been shinin', diamonds gleamin' (Uh)
Rich nigga, they know my name when I'm at Neiman (Uh)
Look at the way that I been ballin' every season (Uh)
Gotta chase the money, watch the whole team win


Find me ridin' through yo' block like Deebo (Yeah)
My life is like a movie, Quentin Tarantino
Nas walked in Louis, I did Valentino
I stack my money tall as Bobby Valentino
Missin' holidays from chasin' C-notes
Volleyball player spread it like a eagle
Go on pop that pussy, spread it on the pillow
Yo' ex-man a scrub, why I call him Brillo
Got a crib up in the Carter feelin' like I'm Nino
John a legend, but we ain't no ordinary people
Might throw a seven, MAC-11 with the Desert Eagle
Hood Pope, I'm like a reverend, teeth is worth a kilo
Killin' niggas like 50 on the Instagram
Hot as fuck but I'm cooler than a ceiling fan
And my nigga Gus locked, go on, free the man
Where they never bring the dogs on the Peter Pan


Her ass out, she goin' places that you can't (Go!)
Call up her hoes and told 'em, "Bring 'em out the sleigh" (Brrr)
Fall, touch her toes, then I'm throwin' 50K (Hey!)
Splash brothers, whoa, we just landed in the Bay (Splash)

Look at the way that I be pushin' in that Hellcat
I was jumpin' out the gym in Nike Air Max
Three bad bitches in the coupe slidin' down Fairfax
Bitch, I been gettin' to this money, I can't dare cap
Look at the way that I been shinin', diamonds gleamin' (Uh)
Rich nigga, they know my name when I'm at Neiman (Uh)
Look at the way that I been ballin' every season (Uh)
Gotta chase the money, watch the whole team win


Woop (Ay), uh (Woop, woop)
40, fuck them other niggas, this the wave (Ay)
Gotta keep a milli' in the cut to beat the case (Case)
Gotta keep banana or the drum, I'm goin' ape (Brrr, brrr)
From the corner, 52, you niggas gettin' ace
Drop it down, went to town, give me love craze
40 lens, triple Benz, everything crazy
I done took a loss so I book it back across
Judgin' by my plans, I can't keep the hoes off
Though I never had love, I just never gave up
Had to get my change up while I never changed up
I don't beef with squares 'cause I gotta move careful
Homie got the barrel, make yo' mommy feel awful
Never told, didn't fold, where the gang go?
Big gold, debit codes, where her drawers go? (Ayy)
Girl, that pussy just ain't good enough to stay
Go from L.A. to the Bay, I'm a legend in the state
Woo!


Her ass out, she goin' places that you can't (Go!)
Call up her hoes and told 'em, "Bring 'em out the sleigh" (Brrr)
Fall, touch her toes, then I'm throwin' 50K (Hey!)
Splash brothers, whoa, we just landed in the Bay (Splash)

Look at the way that I be pushin' in that Hellcat
I was jumpin' out the gym in Nike Air Max
Three bad bitches in the coupe slidin' down Fairfax
Bitch, I been gettin' to this money, I can't dare cap
Look at the way that I been shinin', diamonds gleamin' (Uh)
Rich nigga, they know my name when I'm at Neiman (Uh)
Look at the way that I been ballin' every season (Uh)
Gotta chase the money, watch the whole team win
