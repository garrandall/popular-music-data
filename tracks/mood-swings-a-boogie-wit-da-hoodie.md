Wheezy outta here
Beast, beast


I'm a beast
Oh my God, mood swings
Out of line, mood swings
Out of time
I was broke, I don't cry
I'm the G.O.A.T., I'm a God


I'm a beast, I'm a Goblin, nigga, let that shit fly
Nigga, you don't want no problem
I be feelin' like Batman, my niggas always robbin'
I just got caught fuckin' my best friend, we wylin', yeah
She was my bestie, mm, never knew she was so nasty, mm, yeah
And she so sexy, mm, kissin' on bitches like lesbians, yeah
Ass so fat, oh, bouncin' up and down like a basketball, yeah
Niggas wanna test me, snipe a nigga, treat him like Wesley, yeah


Bitch, I go, big .44, yeah, I know they don't want no smoke
Big face watch, big bank rolls
Big ass bag with the big Lambo'
Bitch, I'm bad, young Mike, I'm a G.O.A.T.
Mike Amiri pants too tight for the pole
Me and my bestie fucked on the low
Can you still trust me? I don't know
No, I don't know, outta' time
I'm so caught out of line
Aderall analyze
Lost my bro, lost my mind
Want my soul, niggas want my life
Tryna' take my hoes, tryna fuck my wife
Mood swings, sometimes I need two at a time
Fuckin' two sets of twins, and one of them shy
Fuck two sets of 10s like a couple of dimes
Fuck two sets of twins like a couple of times
Fuck few sets of twins like a couple of times
Percocets, two times
Percocets, never knew when to come
Percocets, two time
Percocets, never knew when to come


I'm a beast
Oh my God, mood swings
Out of line, mood swings
Out of time
I was broke, I don't cry
I'm a G.O.A.T., I'm a God


I'm a beast, I'm a Goblin, nigga, let that shit fly
Nigga, you don't want no problem
I be feelin' like Batman, my niggas always robbin'
I just got caught fuckin' my best friend, we wylin', yeah
She was my bestie, mm, never know she was so nasty, mm, yeah
And she so sexy, mm, kissin' on bitches like lesbians, yeah
Ass so fat, oh, bouncin' up and down like a basketball, yeah
Niggas wanna test me, snipe a nigga, treat him like Wesley, yeah
