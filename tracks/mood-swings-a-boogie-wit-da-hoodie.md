Patek on my wrist that's a bust down
All I know is get it I'm from up town
Bitches ain't shit It left me stuck down
Only on my dick because I'm up now
Only on my dick because I'm up now
She was with you first but she with us now
All this Aliante shit be bust down
All your shit fugazi let me find out
All your shit fugazi let me find out
All your shit fugazi let me find out
Bitches now a days will get you lined now
Bitches now a days be out of line


AP on my wrist that's a bust down
We done scored the opps that's a touchdown
Caught a nigga lackin that's a man down
We was out in traffic with that automatic
Told em they don't want no static
This shit can get tragic
Hit em all in his face that's a closed casket
Told em they don't want no smoke
This shit get so drastic
Catch a case
Shaka beat that shit like 


I don't fuck wit niggas cause they too fake
I fuck with Boogie I'm recording off a 2 way
Locked up for guns
Had a killer for a roommate
I called her told her take a Plan B
Say its too late
I remember having shootouts on the E way
9 & 22 call I do a 3 way
They closed backpage down
She using Ebates
OTF or FTO I use it each way


OTF HBTL I fuck wit New Lay
I used to ride the 4
The opps were on the 2 train
Don't call my phone no more
Lil Bitch you not my boo thing
Don't call my phone no more
Lil bitch I'm having mood swings
Riding with that HK that's my goonie
I be in my zone I'm in my two three
I used to pop the percs
Thought I was loopy
Its me and Rock and Durk
This shit is too deep
And yeah we come in peace
Don't want no drama
But when it come to defense
We got choppas
And when it come to reefa
We do robber
They don't know lowkey
Yeah I'm a rasta

Patek on my wrist that's a bust down
All I know is get it I'm from up town
Bitches ain't shit It left me stuck down
Only on my dick because I'm up now
Only on my dick because I'm up now
She was with you first but she with us now
All this Aliante shit be bust down
All your shit fugazi let me find out
All your shit fugazi let me find out
All your shit fugazi let me find out
Bitches now a days will get you lined now
Bitches now a days be out of line
