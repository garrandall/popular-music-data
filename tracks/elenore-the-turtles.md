You've got a thing about you
I just can't live without you
I really want you, Elenore, near me

Your looks intoxicate me
Even though your folks hate me
There's no one like you, Elenore, really

Elenore, gee, I think you're swell
And you really do me well
You're my pride and joy, et cetera

Elenore, can I take the time
To ask you to speak your mind?
Tell me that you love me better

I really think you're groovy
Let's go out to a movie
What do you say now, Elenore, can we?

They'll turn the lights way down low
And maybe we won't watch the show
I think I love you, Elenore, love me

Elenore, gee, I think you're swell
And you really do me well
You're my pride and joy, et cetera

Elenore, can I take the time
To ask you to speak your mind?
Tell me that you love me better

Elenore, gee, I think you're swell, ah-ha
Elenore, gee, I think you're swell, ah-ha-ha
