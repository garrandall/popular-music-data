Lucy gets home late at night
She gropes in the dark and flicks on the light
Turnin' the switch on her radio set
And spinning the dial like playing Russian Roulette

Hoping to catch her favorite DJ
Maybe he'll play her "That'll Be the Day"
Taking her back to her high school days
When love was real, not a dream for a day
Not a dream far away

But love, love is on the airwaves tonight
Love is on the airwaves tonight
And no one's gonna hurt you
No one's gonna break your heart

Gary's only 5 feet 4
When he hears his favorite record, he feels 10 feet tall
Dancing around with his headphones on
Dreaming of the woman who's sharing that song

He lies on the bed with his eyes shut tight
You can almost smell her perfume linger in the night
Gary, oh, Gary, it's no sin
It's almost as good as the real thing
The real thing

But love, love is on the airwaves tonight
Love is on the airwaves tonight
And no one's gonna hurt you
No one's gonna break your heart

Love is on the airwaves
Yeah, yeah, love is on the airwaves

I need your loving, I need your loving
Radio, take me away
I need your loving, I need your loving
Radio, take me away

Let me tell you 'bout Rocky, he's the king of the block
The biggest mouth, he's a real hot shot
Spends all his time with revived 45s
Wishing that his dead heroes were alive

Rocky, get back out on the street
The radio's on, listen to the beat
Listen to the beat

But love, love is on the airwaves tonight
Love is on the airwaves tonight
And no one's gonna hurt you
No one's gonna break you
No one's gonna hurt you
No one's gonna break you
No one's gonna hurt you
No one's gonna break your heart

Love is on the airwaves tonight
Love is on the airwaves tonight
Love is on the airwaves tonight
Love is on the airwaves tonight

Love is on the airwaves tonight
Love is on the airwaves tonight
Love, love, love is on the airwaves
Love, love, love is on the airwaves
Love, love, love is on the airwaves
Love, love, love is on the airwaves
