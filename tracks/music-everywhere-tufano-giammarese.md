Music everywhere
Music fills the air

Feeling it running down your spine
Feel it taking over your mind
Celebrate with a bottle of wine
And some music everywhere

Music fills the air

You gotta move it, groove it
You gotta soothe it, and use it
You gotta know what it means to be
What it means to be
You gotta know
What it means

Music everywhere
Music fills the air

Feel it so you'll never let it go
Take in some good old fashioned rock and roll
Get up and dance away the blues you know
And some music everywhere
Music fills the air

You gotta move it, groove it
You gotta soothe it, and use it
You gotta know what it means to be
What it means to be
You gotta know
What it means

Music everywhere
Music fills the air

Feel it running down your spine (music everywhere)
Celebrate with a bottle of wine (music fills the air)
Feel it so you'll never let it go (music everywhere)
Take in some good old fashioned rock and roll (music fills the air)
Get up and dance away the blues you know (music everywhere)
Get up, get up and move
Get up, get up move
