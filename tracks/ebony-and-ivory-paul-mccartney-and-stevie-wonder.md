Ebony and ivory
Live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard
Oh Lord, why don't we?

We all know
That people are the same wherever you go
There is good and bad in everyone
When we learn to live, we learn to give each other
What we need to survive
Together alive

Ebony and ivory
Live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard
Oh Lord, why don't we?

(Ebony, ivory)
(Living in perfect harmony)
(Ebony, ivory, ooh)

We all know
That people are the same wherever you go
There is good and bad, mmm, in everyone
We learn to live when we learn to give each other
What we need to survive
Together alive

Ebony and ivory
Live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard
Oh Lord, why don't we?

Side by side on my piano keyboard
Oh Lord, why don't we?

(Ebony, ivory)
(Living in perfect harmony)
(Ebony, ivory)
(Living in perfect harmony)
(Ebony, ivory)
(Living in perfect harmony)

(Ebony, ivory)
(Living in perfect harmony)
(Ebony, ivory)
(Living in perfect harmony)
(Ebony, ivory)
(Living in perfect harmony)
