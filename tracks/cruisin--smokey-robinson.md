Baby, let's cruise away from here
Don't be confused, the way is clear
And if you want it, you got it forever
This is not a one-night stand, baby, yeah
So, let the music take your mind
Ooh, just release and you will find

You gonna fly away, glad you're goin' my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
The music is played for love, cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

Baby, tonight belongs to us
Everything's right, do what you must
And inch by inch we get closer and closer
To every little part of each other
Let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find, baby

You gonna fly away, glad you're goin' my way
I love it when we're cruising together
The music is played for love, cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

Cruise with me, baby
Cruise with me, baby

Cruise
Ooh, ooh, baby, yeah
Oh, baby
Oh, oh, ah, baby
So good to cruise with you, baby
So good to cruise with you, baby
Ooh, yeah, you and me, baby

Oh, baby, let's cruise
Let's flow, let's glide
Ooh, let's open up, and go inside
And if you want, it you got it forever
I can just stay there inside you
And love you, baby, oh...
Let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find, baby

You gonna fly away, glad you're goin' my way
I love it when we're cruising together
The music is played for love, cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

You gonna fly away, glad you're goin' my way
I love it when we're cruising together
The music is played for love, cruisin' is made for love
I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it...
