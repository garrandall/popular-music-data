Yeah, Ace Hood
What's up baby?
We the Best huh
So I had a few things in mind
Ha ha ha ha
And I was thinkin uhm


Baby, you don't have to try to read my mind
Cause you know I wanna get it in
And tell me why would we just think about it
If you want it then I got it
We can be body to body
Body to body
I don't mean to rush you girl but,
We should be body to body
Body to body, body to body


Uh, picture your body soaking, bath water
No panties on, come up out them leg warmers
Wrap up your hair, leave on your heels
Kissing you while I whisper, shawty how it feels
Let ya mind wonder, oh you're thinking dirty?
I was thinking you can ride me, Miss. Kentucky Derby
Why dream about it, let's take advantage
My body on your body, hope that you can manage
Gotta moan it, damn-it, feels good
Pulling on her hair to let her know I'm still hood
Damn right, serve her the real
This year of the Ace, bet you that she know the deal


Baby, you don't have to try to read my mind
Cause you know I wanna get it in
And tell me why would we just think about it
If you want it then I got it
We can be body to body
Body to body
I don't mean to rush you girl but
We should be body to body
Body to body, body to body


Uh, so quit ya contemplating, skip this conversation
By the way you biting on your lips just gave me confirmation
Was that Chanel 5? Very sexy fragrance
Are those your real eyes
Can tell you're partially asian
But I know your body got me focused, I'm just so sedated
And I guarantee I do you better than your past-n-latest
Body to body, wet as Dasani
Bet if I hit your spot, then I'll make you tsunami
Change up the sheets, no time to sleep
Asked what she's thinking, she replied that I'm a beast
Yeah she replied that I'm a beast
Got it locked between the sheets and even in the streets


Baby, you don't have to try to read my mind
Cause you know I wanna get it in
And tell me why would we just think about it
If you want it then I got it
We can be body to body
Body to body
I don't mean to rush you girl but
But we should be body to body
Body to body, body to body


We're making love on the floor, you're kissing my tattoos
I'm pulling your hair you scream my name
Call me daddy, baby I got you
Go get in your bed and lay down, down, down
Girl, are you ready, cause I'm gonna want you face down, down, down
Right now, you fuckin' with a real freak!


Baby, you don't have to try to read my mind
Cause you know I wanna get it in
And tell me why would we just think about it
If you want it then I got it
We can be body to body
Body to body
I don't mean to rush you girl but
We should be body to body
Body to body, body to body
