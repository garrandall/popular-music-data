You only live twice
Or so it seems
One life for yourself
And one for your dreams

You drift through the years
And life seems tame
'til one dream appears
And love is its name

And love is a stranger
Who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger
Or the stranger is gone

This dream is for you
So pay the price
Make one dream come true 
Make one dream come true
You only live twice 
You only live twice
You only live twice
You only live twice

This dream is for you
So pay the price
Make one dream come true
You only
Make one dream come true
You only live twice 
You only live twice
Make one dream come true 
Make one dream come true
You only live twice 
You only live twice
You only live twice
You only live twice
This dream is for you 
This dream is for you
You only live twice
