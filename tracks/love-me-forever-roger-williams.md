I go sit and talk to Dezzy every chance I get
I be shooting for the stars but it's a chance that I miss
It was some nights I had it hard, I close my eyes and I wish
Bad luck, dealing with karma, all the shit that I did
I show my ass for all the times I had to struggle since a kid
My money long, I'm finally on, if you gon' do it, do it big
God called my nigga home, I gotta be there for his kid
So many people call my phone, no, I ain't change, I just forgive


Yeah, old homies changed, vibes got different, yeah
Even though I'm shy, I ride with glizzies, ayy
Count this paper, why the fuck ain't from Jacksonville
My ho got plastic surgery, I made sure that I got my steel
Kyrie Irving defense, make sure that I got my steel
Poppin' Percocets, I'm prayin' that Crawford get appeal
I spend racks on tennis shoes like Serena Williams
Wanna be Ray Charles when I catch the opps 'cause I'ma hate to see 'em
I been thinkin' 'bout my future, I hope Rocko don't sue me
I done stepped on Roger Davis, most of my socks be Gucci
So many said that they was for me, it's like nobody could prove it
Forever stayin' on my own, so I go


I go sit and talk to Dezzy every chance I get
I be shooting for the stars but it's a chance that I miss
It was some nights I had it hard, I close my eyes and I wish
Bad luck, dealing with karma, all the shit that I did
I show my ass for all the times I had to struggle since a kid
My money long, I'm finally on, if you gon' do it, do it big
God called my nigga home, I gotta be there for his kid
So many people call my phone, no, I ain't change, I just forgive

I asked my nigga, "What would I do without you?"
No matter what, you know a nigga got you
I'm still gon' kill about you
No EA but we got two K's when we slide through
24 hours, we on your block like a drive-thru
Why the fuck you sell me dreams? I never lied to you
Even when I ain't have a car, I was still gon' ride for you
I done let my feelings get involved, now I can't hide from you
My nigga fightin' for his life, ain't nothin' I can do
And that's the fucked up part about it, we still catchin' bodies
They play, we catch a body, it ain't no way around it
Since Granny died, I lost my heart, I still ain't never found it
Even though they ain't help me make the money, they wanna help me count it

I go sit and talk to Dezzy every chance I get
I be shooting for the stars but it's a chance that I miss
It was some nights I had it hard, I close my eyes and I wish
Bad luck, dealing with karma, all the shit that I did
I show my ass for all the times I had to struggle since a kid
My money long, I'm finally on, if you gon' do it, do it big
God called my nigga home, I gotta be there for his kid
So many people call my phone, no, I ain't change, I just forgive


I asked my nigga, "What I'ma do without you?"
No matter what, you know it's war about you
And I still'll die about you
Ain't from New Orleans, I'm rockin' Saint Laurent shoes
This shit get deep, so come and cry in my pool
Hate rubbin' off like it's lotion
I bet my tears fill up an ocean
Judge threw a flag, I heard he holdin'
Conversations with 12
I watched 'em turn to dirty money, they gon' think I'm Denzel
Now I lay me down to sleep
Know the devil want my soul weak
If I should die before I wake
Tell Carl I didn't make it and shoot my killer in the face


If I should die before I wake, go grab that drake
Bloody murders all around the state, I hate to say
I was fucked up, I had to make a play, so I grabbed the plate
Go hit that lick, you better play it safe, go inside the safe
I can't wait 'til I go grab the Wraith and pull up stuntin'
Your dawg got killed, he should've been in the way, he had it comin'
I pulled forty out the bank then went to thumbin'
I put dick all in her face, she seen me comin'
I ghostride the whip like my hands hurt, they call me Casper
Comin' up I didn't have a father, I'm a rich lil' bastard
I thought that rappin' shit ain't work, turned to a trapper
They was schemin' in that church, I became a pastor
If you gon' do it then go do it, don't speak on what happened after
Been grindin' for a long time, it couldn't have happened faster
They think this shit a fairytale like happily ever after
When we was callin', they ain't answer, now the tables turned backwards
Now I put Backwoods to the face 'cause I love the taste
And I turned foreign to them detectives, I ain't know what to say
They tryna build a case, can't help them build a case
What you spent on your wrist today, I put it on my waist
Bitch, I ride where you stay
