Tears on my pillow each morning
I cry when I dream about you
When I should be sleeping I lay there weeping
Wondering if you're weeping too

I'm trying to hard to forget you
But that's not so easy to do
With tears on my pillow each morning
Tears that I've shed over you

Oh you know we were so happy
When love lingered on
Back in the sweet used to be (used to be)
But now I'm so lonely because you are gone
Leaving a sad memory

I'm trying to hard to forget you
But that's not so easy to do
With tears on my pillow each morning
Tears that I've shed over you
