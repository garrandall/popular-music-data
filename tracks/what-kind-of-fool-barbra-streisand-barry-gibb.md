There was a time when we were down and out
There was a place when we were starting over
We let the bough break
We let the heartache in
Who's sorry now
Who's sorry now


There was a world when we were standing still
And for a moment we were separated
And then you found her
You let the stranger in
Together
Who's sorry now


Who's sorry now
What, what kind of fool
Tears it apart
Leaving me pain and sorrow


Losing you now
Wonderin' why
Where will I be tomorrow

Forever more that's what we are to be
Without each other
We'll be remembering when...


There was a time when we were down and out
(We cried)
There was a place when we were starting over
(We lied)
We let the bough break
We let the heartache in
Who's sorry now
Who's sorry now


What, what kind of fool


What, what kind of fool


Tears it apart


Tears it apart


Leaving me pain and sorrow


Oh! Losing you now
How can I win
Where will I be tomorrow


Was there a moment when I cut you down
Played around
What have I done
I only apologize
For being as they say, the last to know
It has to show
When someone is in your eyes


What, what kind of fool
Tears it apart
Leaving me pain and sorrow
Losing you now
Wondering why
Where will I be tomorrow
What, what kind of fool
Tears it apart
Leaving me pain and sorrow
Losing you now
How can I win
Where will I be tomorrow
