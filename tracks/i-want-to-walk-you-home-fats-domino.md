I want to walk you home
please let me walk you home
I want to walk you home
please let me walk you home
you look so good to me oowee
I wish I was a lucky guy
you've been walking right on

I love the way you walk
I love to hear you talk
I love the way you walk
I love to hear you talk
I'm not trying to be smart
I'm not trying to break your heart
but if I ask you for a date
then you tell me that I'm not too late

I want to hold your hand
please let me hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
please let me hold your hand
you look so good to me oowee
I saw you walking all alone
that's why when I walk you home

So let me walk you home
please let me walk you home
I wanna walk you home
please let me walk you home
you look so good to me oowee

That's why I want to walk you home...
That's why I want to walk you home...
