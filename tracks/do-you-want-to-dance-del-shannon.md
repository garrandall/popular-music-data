Do you wanna dance and hold my hand?
Tell me that I'm your man
Baby, do you wanna dance?

Do you wanna dance under the moonlight?
Squeeze and kiss me all through the night
Baby, do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna dance girl and hold my hand?
Tell me that I'm your man
Baby, do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna dance under the moonlight?
Love me girl all through the night
Baby, do you wanna dance?


Girl now do you do you do you do you wanna dance?
Do you do you do you do you wanna dance?
Do you do you wanna dance?


Yes, do you wanna dance I mean under the moonlight?
Squeeze and kiss me all through the night
Baby, do you wanna dance?
