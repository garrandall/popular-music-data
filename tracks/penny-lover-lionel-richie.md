The first time I saw you
Oh, you looked so fine
And I had a feeling
One day you'd be mine
Honey you came along and captured my heart
Now my love is somewhere lost in your kiss
When I'm all alone it's you that I miss
Girl a love like yours is hard to resist
Oh, oh, oh oohoh

Penny lover, my love's on fire
Penny lover, you're my one desire
Tell me baby could this be true
That I could need someone, like I need you

Nights warm and tender
Lying next to you
Girl I surrender
Oh, what more can I do
I've spent all of my life in search of your love
Now there's one more thing I'd like to say
Don't you ever take your sweet love away
Girl I'll do anything, just please stay
Oh, oh

I don't understand it, oh what's come over me
But I'm not gonna worry, no not anymore
'cause when a man's in love, he's only got one story
That's why my love is somewhere lost in your kiss
When I'm lost and alone it's you that I miss
With a love like yours, it's hard to resist
Oh, oh oh


Penny lover, don't you walk on by (don't you walk on by)
Penny lover, don't you make me cry (don't you make me cry baby)
Penny lover, don't you walk on by (don't you walk on by)
Penny lover, don't you make me cry (oh penny baby)
Penny lover, don't you walk on by (don't you walk on by)
I remember the first time I saw you baby
Penny lover, don't you make me cry
You had the look in your eye, you had the look in your eye, yeah, yeah
Oh pretty baby
I just wanted to reachout and touch you baby
I just want to reach out and hold ya, I want to reach out and say oh oh
Don't make me cry
I wanna talk about you everyday (penny lover)
Need you, need you baby
