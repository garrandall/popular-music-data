There's a pale moon in the sky
The kind you make your wishes on
Oh, like the light in your eyes
The one I built my dreams upon
It's not there any longer
Something happened somewhere and we both know why
But me, I'm getting stronger
We must stop pretending, I can't live this life


I don't care who's wrong or right
I don't really wanna fight no more
Too much talking, babe
Let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really wanna fight no more
This is time for letting go


I hear a whisper in the air
It simply doesn't bother me
Can't you see that I don't care
Or are you looking right through me?
It seems to me that lately (Seems to me that lately)
You look at me the wrong way and I start to cry
Could it be that maybe (Could it be that maybe)
This crazy situation is the reason why?


I don't care who's wrong or right
I don't really wanna fight no more
Too much talking, babe
Let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really wanna fight no more
Time for letting go
Oh, baby, don't you know
That I don't wanna hurt no more?
It's time, I'm walking, babe
Don't care now who's to blame
I don't really wanna fight no more
This is time for letting go


Hanging on to the past
It only stands in our way
We had to grow for our love to last
But we just grew apart
Oh, don't wanna hurt no more


Oh, baby, don't you know?
No, I don't wanna hurt no more
Too much talking, babe
Don't care now who's to blame
I don't really wanna fight no more
I don't care who's wrong or right
I don't really wanna fight no more
It's time, I'm walking, babe
So let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really wanna fight no more
This is time for letting go
No, I don't wanna hurt no more
Too much, hey, baby
Don't care now who's to blame
I don't really wanna fight no more
'Cause this is time for letting go


Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Hmm, so let it go
