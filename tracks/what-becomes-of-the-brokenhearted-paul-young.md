As I walk this land of broken dreams
I have visions of many things
Happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion

What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Help me please

The roots of love grow all around
But for me they come tumbling down
Everyday heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer

I walk in shadows searching for light
Going it alone, no comfort in sight
Hoping and praying for someone who cares
Always moving but going nowhere

What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Help me please

I'm searching though I don't succeed, no
For someone's love there's a growing need
All is lost there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending

What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind

I'll be searching everywhere
Just to find someone who cares
I'll be looking every day,
I know I'm gonna find a way
Nothing's gonna stop me now
I'll find a way somehow
Woo, hoo
I'll find a way somehow

What you've got to know is
What becomes of the brokenhearted
I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do the best I can, girl
Woooo hoo
I've gotta, gotta find her
Mmm mmm mmm, gotta find a way somehow, sugar
(What becomes of the brokenhearted)
I need love, baby
(Who had love that's now departed)
I need ya, darling, oh whoa, yeah
I've gotta find a woman who is gonna love me, love me
