I'm the one who put South Ah on the fucking map
Booking fee thats 200 Gs for the fucking bag
What's under the rag? It's another rag
Tell me, tell me
What's under the bag, its another bag
Baby
All you fucking brands need to holla back
I'm gon' live forever like Coachella
Call me Pac with the hologram
Don't you see the luggage with the monogram
(Don't you see)
I'm gon' treat your husband like another fan
Rubber bands, all types of crazy colors
Shabba Ranks, call me Mr. Lover Lover
Lethal Weap', Back to Back, Danny Glover
Funeral plan, dead bodies no discussion
(No discussion)
(Bust it)

And I'm smoking choking
Standing on the sofa with the phone
Say what's up? (what's up?)
Lately I been way too focused
On the motions so my elevator up

Is it finna bust a move? (bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it)
I'm gon' make your dreams come true (oh)
Kick your besty out the room
Now it's all about me and you

Baby you know
Whats mine is yours
I love you more
And time is a gone

Is it finna bust a move? (bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it)
I'm gon' make your dreams come true (oooh)
Kick your besty out the room
Now it's all about me and you

Niggas is jealous, all in their feelings
Dennis The Menace, now who Mr. Wilson?
We getting jiggy with it
Shoutout to Will Smith
I'm from the Diddy era
Who gon' put Forbes on the Forbes list?
I need more kicks like a spoiled kid in August
In the sec' sipping Demi-Sec
Bitches ain't well like dog shit
Rand Water VVS dripping out faucet
Niggas ask, "Hey Forbes Man"
"Is it going to be all-win when you're frost bit like Offset?"
Top floor with hot sauce on the oysters
Niggas wanna rock dad hats
From Le Coq Sport', thats moisture
Good girls turn to bad bads
When I pass that to the boizins
Relax with the "we" chat that's poison
What's up with your boyfriend?
(Oh yeah)

And I'm smoking choking
Standing on the sofa with the phone
Say what's up? (what's up?)
Lately I been way too focused
On the motions so my elevator up

Is it finna bust a move? (bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it)
I'm gon' make your dreams come true (oooh)
Kick your besty out the room
Now it's all about me and you

Baby you know
Whats mine is yours
I love you more
And time is a gone

Is it finna bust a move? (bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it)
I'm gon' make your dreams come true (oooh)
Kick your bestie out the room
Now it's all about me and you

I need a real one
I need a time out
Who finna vibe out?
How far the guy now?
Cav'a the big rocks
Money talks and the bullshit
Took a long walk like Jill Scott
What is still dawg, thats Hip Hop
Diamonds is dancing, like Michael Jackson
Bitches is ratchet, titties is plastic
Show me the assets, send me the address
Open the champers, extravaganza
Gatsby, Bunny Chow, Spatlo
Penthouse, en suite, no glove, no love
Jack Mabaso
Diamonds for my timer
We some brasse from the Kaap though
Reddy D with the legacy
On the road to riches with the padkos
Woo, that's hot though
Real shit Los Blancos

And I'm smoking choking
Standing on the sofa with the phone
Say what's up? (what's up?)
Lately I been way too focused
On the motions so my elevator up

Is it finna bust a move? (bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it)
I'm gon' make your dreams come true
Kick your besty out the room
Now it's all about me and you

Baby you know
Whats mine is yours
I love you more
And time is a gone

Is it finna bust a move? (bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it)
I'm gon' make your dreams come true
Kick your besty out the room
Now it's all about me and you
