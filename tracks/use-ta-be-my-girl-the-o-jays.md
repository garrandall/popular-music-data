Ooh, good lovin'
The girl's got plenty good lovin'
Ask me how I know
And I'll tell you so
She used ta be my girl

I, I respect her
When she was mine
I used to neglect her
Oh, she wanted more
Than I could give
But as long as I live
She'll be my girl

She, she used ta be my girl
She used ta be my girl

She had a charming personality
The girl was so right for me
She's my girl
And if I had the chance
Lord knows I'd take her back
As a matter of fact
Right away like today

Not only good lookin'
The girl was so smart
You can't beat her cookin'
Oh, ask me how I know
And I'll tell you so
She used ta be my girl, ooh

Deep down inside
I still love her
I place no one above her
She's warm and sensitive
For as long as I live
She'll be my girl

And if I had the chance
I'd take her back
Lord knows, as a matter of fact
Right away like today, ooh

Good lovin'
The girl's got plenty good lovin'
Ask me how I know
And I'll tell you so

She used ta be my girl, my girl
She used ta be, she used ta be my girl
She used ta be my girl (I wouldn't lie about a thing like that)
She used ta be my girl
She used ta be my girl (I know you don't believe me)
She used ta be my girl (But she really did)
She used ta be my girl
She used ta be my girl
She used ta be my girl
