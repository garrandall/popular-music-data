Can anybody find me?
Somebody to love

Each morning I get up
I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the
Mirror and cry
Lord
What you're doing to me
I have spent all my years
In believing you
But I just can't get no
Relief, Lord!

Somebody, somebody
Can anybody find me?
Somebody to love

I work hard every day
Of my life
I work till I ache my bones
At the end I take home
My hard
Earned pay all on my own
I get down on my knees
And I start to pray
Till the tears run down
From my eyes

Lord, somebody, somebody
Can anybody find me?
Somebody to love?

(He works hard)
Everyday
I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to
Put me down
They say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of
Water in my brain
Got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, Lord
Somebody, somebody
Can anybody find me?
Somebody to love?

Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat
I'm OK, I'm alright
I ain't gonna face no defeat
I just gotta get out of
This prison cell
Someday I'm gonna
Be free, Lord!

Need somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
(Somebody)
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Oh
Somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody
Somebody find me
Somebody to love
Somebody, somebody
Find me somebody to love
Can anybody find me?
Somebody to love
Somebody find me
Somebody find me
Somebody to love
Somebody, somebody
Somebody
Somebody to love
Somebody to love
Find me, somebody to
Love
