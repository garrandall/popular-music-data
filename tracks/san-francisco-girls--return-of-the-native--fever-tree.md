Out there it's summertime
Milk and honey days
Oh, San Francisco girls with
San Francisco ways
Don't try to stop me girl, you can't have your way
Don't try to stop me girl, nothin' you can say
Live like you wanna live and stay where you wanna stay
I just gotta go and get back to the Bay
So you love me girl, you're just in my way
Don't try to stop me girl, I'm movin' out today
Do what you wanna do and play what you wanna play
I just gotta go and get back to the Bay
