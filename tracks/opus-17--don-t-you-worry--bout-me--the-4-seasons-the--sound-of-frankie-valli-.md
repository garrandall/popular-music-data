I can see there ain't no room for me
You're only holding out your heart in sympathy
If there's another man, then girl I understand
Go on and take his hand, and don't you worry about me

I'll be blue, and I'll be crying, too
But girl you know I only want what's best for you
What good is all my pride, if all your love has died
Go on and be a bride, and don't you worry about me

I'll be strong, I'll try to carry on
Although you know it won't be easy when you're gone
I'll always think of you, the tender love we knew
But somehow I'll get through, so don't you worry about me

Ooh, ooh, baby

Sweetie pie, before you say goodbye
Remember if he ever leaves you high and dry
Don't cry alone in pain, don't ever feel ashamed
If you want me again, just don't you worry about me

I love you, no matter what you do
I'll spend my whole life waiting if you want me to
And if this is goodbye, you know I'd rather die
Than let you see me cry, 'cause then you'd worry about me

I'll be strong, I'll try to carry on
Although you know it won't be easy when you're gone
I'll always think of you, the tender love we knew
But somehow I'll get through, so don't you worry about me

I'll be strong, I'll try to carry on
Although you know it won't be easy when you're gone
I'll always think of you, the tender love we knew
But somehow I'll get through, so don't you worry about me
