If you're looking for a lover
You don't have to look no further
I'm the one

If you want to have a good time
Playing in the midnight sunshine
I'm the one

If you're looking for a hot night
I can put you in the spotlight
I'm the one

If it's pleasure that you're after
Party lights and fun and laughter
I'm the one

When it comes to making love
I am the best
I'm all yours
Put me to the test
Love is my specialty
And I know what to do
To make you give your love to me

For real live celebration
And a standing ovation
I'm the one

Like a hundred angels strumming
Baby, I can keep it coming
I'm the one

When it comes to making love
I am the best
I'm all yours
Put me to the test
Love is my specialty
And I know what to do
To make you give it up
I know what to do
To make you give it up
I know what to do
To make you give it up
I know what to do
To make you give your love to me

If you're looking for a lover
You don't have to look no further
I'm the one

If you want to have a good time
Playing in the midnight sunshine
I'm the one

When it comes to making love
I am the best
I'm all yours
Put me to the test
Love is my specialty
And I know what to do
To make you give your love to me

Making love I am the best
I'm all yours
Put me to the test
It's my specialty
I know what to do

Making love I am the best
I'm all yours
Put me to the test
My specialty
And I know what to do

Comes to making love
I'm all yours
