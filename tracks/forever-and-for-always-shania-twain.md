In your arms I can still feel the way you
Want me when you hold me
I can still hear the words you whispered
When you told me
I can stay right here forever in your arms

And there ain't no way
I'm lettin' you go now
And there ain't no way
And there ain't no how
I'll never see that day


'Cause I'm keeping you
Forever and for always
We will be together all of our days
Wanna wake up every
Morning to your sweet face - always

Mmm, baby
In your heart - I can still hear
A beat for every time you kiss me
And when we're apart
I know how much you miss me
I can feel your love for me in your heart

And there ain't no way
I'm lettin' you go now
And there ain't no way
And there ain't no how
I'll never see that day

'Cause I'm keeping you
Forever and for always
We will be together all of our days
Wanna wake up every
Morning to your sweet face - always

(I wanna wake up every morning)

In your eyes - (I can still see
The look of the one) I can still see
The look of the one who really loves me
(I can still feel the way that you want)
The one who wouldn't put anything
Else in the world above me
(I can still see love for me) I can
Still see your love for me in your eyes
(I still see the love)

And there ain't no way
I'm lettin' you go now
And there ain't no way
And there ain't no how
I'll never see that day

Cause I'm keeping you forever and for always
We will be together all of our days
Wanna wake up every morning to your sweet face
I'm keeping you forever and for always
We will be together all of our days
Wanna wake up every morning to your sweet face
I'm keeping you forever and for always
I'm in your arms
