It was late one night in the 4-0-4 
I was gone off that water chillen on the front porch 
I was lean back laxin in puffin on some swag 
When this bitch came up in a tight ass jag 
She pulled right in the driveway bumpin' Clint Black 
We she stepped to the ride i had to take a step back 
She had long blonde hair and an ass that wouldnt quit 
Titties fallen all out becuz her shirt didnt fit 
Started walkin up to me and she dropped the keys 
Kneeled down to pick 'em up and all i saw was g-string 
Pussy lips hangin' out and it was the shit 
Now im sprung on a bitch in a XJ6 



Hey lady in the Jaguar 

How'd you get you so much money 

What u doin' out here, down there, 'roud here 

Hey lady in the Jaguar 

Who u trying to impress 

What u doin' out here, down there, 'roud here 



It was jumpin' down town on a Saturday night 
I was wipin' car windows on the corner street light 
She was parlayin' on a money green Jaguar 
She locked the door 
Now whatcha' do that for? 
I could see she had a dead fox chillin on her shoulder 
Blonde highlight hair her face a little older 
I knocked on the windshield and kissed the glass 
I think I probably scarred a dune out of her ass 
But shepeeled my wig back and offer me a ride 
Smiled at a Juggalo and told me "get inside" 
Im like, "hell yeah bitch, you old rich freak" 
I went to get inshe peeled off and ran over my feet 





O shit, who that?..rollin' down the block 
Another closet smoker lookin' for some rock 
The Jag pulled up and the window rolled down 
"I'm lookin for the infamous Shaggz The Clown" 
I tried to say "what up" but before i had the chance 
I seen her camel toes trying to push through her pants 
So i said "come here bitch" she said "What fo'" 
She grabbed me by the pants and open up the do' 
She pulled out her titties said she likes kinky stuff 
If i wanted the neden I had to put on these handcuffs 
She cuff me to the seat "A yo' what the hell" 
She said "I'm taking u in for jumpin' your bell" 




How'd u get you so much money 
Who you trying to impress
