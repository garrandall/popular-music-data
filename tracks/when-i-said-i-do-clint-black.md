Clint Black & Lisa Hartman Black

These times are trouble
And these times are good
There always gonna be
They rise and they fall
We take them all the way that we should
Together you and me
Forsaking them all

Deep in the night
And by the light of day
It always looks the same
True love always does
Here by your side or a million miles away
Nothin' is ever gonna change the way I feel
The way it is, is the way that it was

Chorus:
When I said I do, I meant that I will
Til' the end of all time
Be faithful and true, devoted to you
That's what I had in mind, when I said I do

Well this whole world keeps changin'
And the world stays the same
For all who came before
And it goes hand in hand

Only you and I can undo
All that we became
That makes us so much more (so much more)
Than a woman and a man

After everything
That comes and goes around
Has only passed us by
Here alone in our dreams

I know there's a lonely heart
In every lost and found
But forever you and I will be the ones
Who found out what forever means


Truer than true
You know that I'll always be there for you

That's what I had in mind
That's what I had in mind

Together:
When I said I do
