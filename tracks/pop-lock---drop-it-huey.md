Aye, it's so beautiful when a plan comes together yup
It's your boy melv hits 
You already know what this is 
H-U-E-Y (reemix) 
Bow Weezy 
T-Pain 
Hits Commited 
partna

 
It's H-U-E-Y, home fly G five 
And by the look in my eyes she have nice thighs 
What her mama done gave her then grew from local to major 
Pockets flooded with paper, born as a Missouri stater 
Mami gon take it low if you can then touch your toes 
You and your partna them, you can get dollas then 
Trickin aint in my blood, but I'ma make it rain on'em 
Too rich for dolla bills, I consider that as change 
25's on my range, know that that's a odd number 
The way you tootin that thang can make the guys wonder 
What's underneathe or even if it's real 
I'm hoping she a freak cause I ain't tryna chill 
I'm tryna get it poppin, wit a shortie like mine 
Thats willing to drop it low enough to blow my mind 
It's H-U-E-Z and Bow Weezy 
Let's see if she can get lower than before on the remix 

 
Toot that thang up mamii make it roll 
once you pop, pop lock it for me girl get low 
if yo mama gave it to you, baby girl let it show 
once you pop lock drop it for me maybe we can roll (oh) 

Pop lock and drop it 

 
Damn lil mama I'm sayin 
All that in them jeans (woo) 
Aye, aye, let me holla at chu for a minute 
Hey what it is they call me Bow Wizzle 
Now pop, lock, drop it for me, make that thang jiggle 
She moves her hips just like Shakira 
If she was in a contest she would be the winner (yep) 
From Ohio all the way to St. Louis, hey all the girls do it just put your back into it 
Now shake what she gave ya, I'm talking bout ya mama 
If you wont do it for me then do it for these dollas 
Cause I'ma make it rain, these otha dudes is lame 
They talk a good game, but they can't do the same 
Now drop it up and down, now take it to the ground 
If you wanna please me baby all you gotta do is 
Pop, Lock, and Drop It 
But baby don't stop it, we can do it like Chris Brown girl get it poppin 
Man I'm a pro, look I'm far from a rookie 
Girl get your pretty self over here gimme them cookies 

 
Toot that thang up mamii make it roll 
once you pop, pop lock it for me girl get low 
if yo mama gave it to you, baby girl let it show 
once you pop lock drop it for me maybe we can roll (oh) 

Pop lock and drop it 

 
Shawty snap (yeah!) 
GodDamn, shawty snap (shaw-tay!) 
Yea 
Now let me ask you a lil question that you never heard 
How do you make them dollas disappear like i'm for real for a lack of better words 
Let me introduce my friend, Huey and Bow Wow 
I'm the pain better known as Teddy Pin-Her-Ass-Down 
I'm G (yea) 
But, you probably already knew that 
But you didn't know that I could make you pop, lock and do that 
Now understand i'm the baddest man alive 
So let's just bend your knees and do the G5 
now we fly
Yea you can do it (yea) 
Yea I know you see me (yea) 
Yea you wanna be me (yea) 
Yea you got my CD (yea) 
Yea thats hits commited (yea) 
Yea thats Baby Huey (yea) 
Yea thats Bow Weezy (yea) 
Yea thats Teddy Pain 
I'ma make you climb the pole 
I'ma play you depending on how this money unfold
And I got it from my mama I aint tryna go pro 
If you pop lock drop it I might let all of this go 
Oooh 

 
Toot that thang up mamii make it roll
once you pop, pop lock it for me girl get low
if yo mama gave it to you, baby girl let it show 
once you pop lock drop it for me maybe we can roll (oh)
