I can't imagine life
without you by my side
This is love baby that I'm feeling
and I'm hoping
that you're feeling the same way
things tend to slip my mind
like how you like to wine and dine baby
with romantic lights you mean a lot to me
in so many ways 

Lately
have I told you I love you
lately
have I told you you still mean the world to me
lately 
have I told you I love you
I'll be your wishing well 
tell me what you want baby 

don't think twice of our love
I say these things because
I love you but it's hard to explain
and I'm hoping that you're feeling the same way
You know that all of my
feelings are inside
and verbally I tend to forget
how much I L-O-V-E U Really means 

Lately
have I told you I love you
lately
have I told you you still mean the world to me
lately
have I told you I love you
I'll be your wishing well 
tell me what you want baby 


Try your hardest to deal
yes I forgot but you know how I feel
things slip my mind baby that's a fact
tell me you love me
and I'll tell you back
