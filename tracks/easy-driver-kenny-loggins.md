Easy driver, she's a wicked rider
She's smooth and she's skinny and she's probably mean
Easy driver, pull up beside her, roll down the window on this fine machine


(Ooh ooh ooh) don't turn away, (ooh ooh ooh) just give me a sign
(Ooh ooh ooh) don't be afraid, (ooh ooh) love is so hard to find
Easy driver, get on up beside her, she don't drive like she knows the way
Easy driver, road's getting wider

There's room to run and she might skate away
Come on back, baby what you say



One lane away from love, the story of my life
Could I be good enough for your lonely avenue tonight
It's a lonely avenue tonight



Easy driver, she's a wicked rider
She's smooth and she's skinny and she's probably mean
Easy driver, get on up beside her, roll down the window on this fine machine
Easy driver, oh oh oh oh, easy driver, easy driver, easy driver (easy driver)
Easy driver, easy driver, easy driver, easy driver
