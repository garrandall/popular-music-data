Oh, what you do to me
Oh, what you do to me, little girl
Oh, have another hit of sweet air

Oh, have another hit of fresh air
Oh, have another hit

Oh, baby what you gonna do?
I what to know what you gonna do sweet thing?
Oh, have another hit of sweet love in the morning
Oh, have another hit

I love you, yes I do

Oh, have another hit of sweet California sunshine
Oh, have another hit

Take me home, take me home
Take me home, I wanna go home with you
Oh, have another hit of fresh air
