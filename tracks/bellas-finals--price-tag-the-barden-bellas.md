Seems like everybody's got a price,
I wonder how they sleep at night,
When the sale comes first and the truth comes second,
Just stop for a minute and smile,

Everybody look to the left,
Everybody look to the right,
Can you feel that yeah,
We're paying with love tonight,

(It ain't about the money)

It's not about the money, money, money,
We don't need your money, money, money,
We just wanna make the world dance,
Forget about the price tag,

It ain't about the (ugh) cha ching cha ching,
It's not about the (yeah) ba bling ba bling,
Wanna make the world dance,
Forget about the price tag,
(Price tag forget about the price tag)
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

Won't you come see about me,
I'll be alone dancing, you know it, baby,
Tell me your troubles and doubts,
Giving me everything inside and out,

Don't you forget about me,
(You look amazing just the way you are!)

As you walk on by,
Will you call my name,
As you walk on by,
Will you call my name,
As you walk on by
Will you call my name

I say la lalalala lalalala lalalala lalalala
(You look amazing just the way you are!)

Tonight,
I will love, love you tonight,
Give me everything tonight,
For all we know we might not get tomorrow,
Let's do it tonight,

Forget what they say,
All my care they play,
I want you tonight,

Grab somebody sexy,
Tell them, "Hey."
Give me everything tonight,
(There's not a thing that I would change)
Give me everything tonight,

Take advantage of tonight (what's up)
'Cause tomorrow I'm off to Dubai to perform for a princess
(We just want to make the world dance)
But tonight, I can make you my queen,
(We just wanna make the world dance)
And make love to you endless,

This is insane: the way the name growin'
(We just wanna make the world dance)
Money keep flowin', hustlers move aside,
So, I'm tip-toeing to keep blowing,
(We just wanna make the world dance)
I got it locked up like Lindsay Lohan,

(Forget about the price tag)
Put it on my life, baby,
I make you feel right, baby,
Can't promise tomorrow,
But I'll promise tonight, dal√©

Excuse me,
But I might drink a little more than I should tonight,
And I may take you home with me if I could tonight,
(Don't you forget about me)
And baby I will make you feel so good tonight,
'Cause we might not get tomorrow tonight.
Night, night, night, night, n-n-n-n-n-n-n, uh.

Hands up,
I put my hands up,

Don't you forget about me,
(Party in the U.S.A.)

Tonight,
I will love love you tonight,
Give me everything tonight,
(Hands up, they're playing my song)
For all we know,
We might not get tomorrow,
Let's do it tonight
