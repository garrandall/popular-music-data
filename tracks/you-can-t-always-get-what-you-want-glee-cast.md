Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so I call your name
Whispers in morning our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel this thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high I long to get by
This time is forever 
Love is the answer


I hear your voice now you are my choice now
The love we bring
Heaven's in my heart at your call I hear harps
And angels sing
You know how I feel this thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you


I just can't hold on 


I feel we belong


My life ain't worth living if I can't be with you


I just cant stop loving you
I just cant stop loving you
And if I stop then tell me just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you


At night when the stars shine I pray in you I'll find
A love so true


When morning awakes me 
You come and take me
I'll wait for you


You know how I feel 
I wont stop until
I hear your voice saying, I do 


I do
This thing can't go wrong 


This feel's so strong


Well, my life ain't worth living 


If I can't be with you


I just cant stop loving you (oh no!)
I just cant stop loving you (loving you)
And if I stop (uh woah) 
Then tell me just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you


We can change all the world tomorrow


We can sing songs of yesterday


I can say hey, farewell to sorrow


This is my life and I


Want to see for always


I just cant stop loving you (ooh, baby no!)
I just cant stop loving you (cant, cant stop!)
And if I stop (no!) 
Then tell me just what will I do (what will do!)
I just can't stop loving you (eee)

I just cant stop loving you 
I just cant stop loving you (no, will do) 
And if I stop 
Then tell me just what will I do 
I just can't stop loving you
