I looked at Heaven
And you looked back at me
I looked at Heaven
It was a wonderful thing to see

Your smiling face
And there in your eyes
Every star in place
Like they are in the skies

I talked to Heaven
When you said I love you
I walked with Heaven
Under a sky of blue

It was wonderful
Absolutely, it was meant to be
When I looked at Heaven
And you looked back at me

Your smiling face
And there in your eyes
Every star in place
Like they are in the skies

I talked to Heaven
When you said I love you
I walked with Heaven
Under a sky of blue

It was wonderful
Absolutely, it was meant to be
When I looked at Heaven
And you looked back at me
