Soulja Boy Tell'em


Do not turn me down
DJ turn me up
Roscoe dats wassup (wassup) and shawty we


All the way turnt up 
All the way turnt up (shawty we all the way turnt up) 


DJ turn me up, crank it to the max
I got lots of gwalla, I be blowin stacks
Polo on my hat, shoes and shirt dat match
I be so turnt up, I be swaggin to the max
If u get it in, and u gettin dough
Gon pop a bottle, dis rite here yo song
Purple by the zone, u can smell it on my clothes
And it went up in my switch up bout to take one to tha doe
I'm gone in another zone
I be riding on the engine with no roof goin strong
Dey like wat is goin on
I don't realy kno
Den I roll up all my windows, and I crank dis shit some moe broooooo




Hopped up out da bed, wat happenin
Soulja Boy Tellem, turn them to my level man
Yeeaaah
Money on the table
All up in Mexico, gettin to the peso
Whoooa
Check out the gear
If gettin money was a sport, I'm MVP every year
Gettin money ova here
Den I kno where I'm from
Yo girl spinnin on my dick jus like a cd rom
T-t-t-t-turn uuppp
Turn up til u can't turn no mo
Burn up til u can't burn no mo
Rock my chain er'where I go
Smoke til u can't smoke no mo
Choke til u can't choke no mo
Work til u can't work no mo
I'm rich I can't get rich no mo




Turn up
All I kno is turn up
Smokin like a hippie I swear all I do is burn up
I'm in VIP and they be actin like they kno us
I'm like free turn up
Excuse me wile I turn up
All dese hoes be choosen but I'm turnt up all the way
I don't turned up on da road
I be turned up round da globe 
All dese niggas mad cause I be pullin all they hoes
First I get em to the room
They be turnt up out they clothes like

And I be goin ham
I don't think dese niqqas really kno jus how I am
Just r-o-s-c-o-e dash
And I gets lots of cash
But for short u call me Mr Way to turnt up for your ass
