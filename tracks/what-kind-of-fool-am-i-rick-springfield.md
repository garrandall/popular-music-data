I wonder who she's seeing tonight
Is she really going out with him
He's not her type
And doing all the things
She used to do with me
Well, I'd say something to her
But I get so jealous
When I think of her loving someone else
And I can't think why we ever let go
We must have been crazy
Tell me what kind of fool am I
To just let go,To just let go like that
What kind of fool am I, To lose you
She was cold sometimes
But she made me feel alive
She was such a spoiled baby
But baby she could love
And she loved me like nobody
Ever will again
I thought we'd be together 
When the world ran down
When the curtains fell 
And the lights came up 
But the gods or whatever
Make the world go 'round
Shuffled when they should've cut
Tell me
What kind of fool am I
To just let go, To just let go like that
What kind of fool am I
To lose you
Did it come to easy to the two of us
Did we go to wrong to ever make it right
Were we too busy checking out the left hand 
That we didn't see the right
Tell me
What kind of fool am I
To just let go, To just let go like that
What kind of fool am I
Oh baby please, Oh baby please come back
I meant to say in time
Baby we can work it out
But I never meant to say goodbye
Tell me
What kind of fool am I
What kind of fool am I
What kind of fool am I
To lose you
