Awww Yah!
Billys at the bar, he's been there all night 
First ten beers hes had, since her goodbye
HEY! HEY!

She left him broke, in his new truck
He don't smoke, but he lights one up 
Temporary fix, for his heartache
Hes hurting bad, but hes feeling great

Hes on the dance floor yelling Freebird
Singing off pitch but he knows every word
Grabs him a girl and he holds on tight
Hes chasing everything in sight
Hell fall apart when he gets home
But right now his worries are gone
Life looks good, good, good
Billys got his beer goggles on
Hey!

Lot of drunks, get real mean
Theyll pick a fight, over anything
Billy wants to laugh, that's why hes here
You won't see him cry, unless you spill his beer

Hes on the dance floor yelling Freebird
Singing off pitch but he knows every word
Grabs him another girl and he holds on tight
Now hes chasing everything in sight
Hell fall apart when he gets home
Right now his worries are gone
Life looks good, good, good
Billy's got his beer goggles.....on

Hes on the dance floor yelling Freebird
Singing off pitch but he knows every word
Grabs him another girl he hold on tight
He don't see ugly
Through blood shot eyes
Hell fall apart when he gets home
But right now his worries are gone
Cause life looks good, good, good
So good, good, good,
Life looks good, good, good
Billy's got his beer goggles.....on
