You're my love, you're my angel
You're the girl of my dreams
And I'd like to thank you for waiting patiently

Daddy's home
Daddy's home to stay

How I've waited for this moment
To be by your side
Your best friends wrote and told me
You had teardrops in your eyes

Daddy's home
Daddy's home to stay

It wasn't on a Sunday
Monday and Tuesday went by
It wasn't on a Tuesday afternoon

All I could do was cry
But I made a promise that you treasure
And I made it back home to you

How I've waited for this moment
To be by your side
Your best friend wrote and told me
You had teardrops in your eyes

Daddy's home
Daddy's home to stay
Daddy's home to stay

I'm not a thousand miles away
