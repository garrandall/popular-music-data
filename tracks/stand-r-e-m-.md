Stand in the place where you live
Now face north
Think about direction
Wonder why you haven't before
Now stand in the place where you were
Now face west
Think about the place where you live
Wonder why you haven't before


If you are confused, check with the sun
Carry a compass to help you along
Your feet are going to be on the ground
Your head is there to move you around


Stand in the place where you live
Now face north
Think about direction
Wonder why you haven't before
Now stand in the place where you were
Now face west
Think about the place where you live
Wonder why you haven't before


Your feet are going to be on the ground
Your head is there to move you around
If wishes were trees, the trees would be falling
Listen to reason, the season is calling


Stand in the place where you live
Now face north
Think about direction
Wonder why you haven't before
Now stand in the place where you were
Now face west
Think about the place where you live
Wonder why you haven't before


If wishes were trees, the trees would be falling
Listen to reason, reason is calling
Your feet are going to be on the ground
Your head is there to move you around


So stand (Stand!)
Now face north
Think about direction
Wonder why you haven't before
Now stand (Stand!)
Now face west
Think about the place where you live
Wonder why you haven't


Stand in the place where you live
Now face north
Think about direction
Wonder why you haven't before
Now stand in the place where you were
Now face west
Think about the place where you live
Wonder why you haven't before


Stand in the place where you are
Now face north
Stand in the place where you are
Now face west
Your feet are going to be on the ground
(Stand in the place where you are)
Your head is there to move you around, so stand
