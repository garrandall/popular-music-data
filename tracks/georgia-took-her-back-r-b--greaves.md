When I woke up yesterday
I found I was alone
A note was on my pillow
Said she'd gone back home
Tried to find myself
As the sleep was in my eyes
Read the note again
And I suddenly realized

Georgia took her back
Georgia took her back
Georgia took my baby
Georgia took her back

Georgia took her back
Georgia took her back
Georgia took my baby
Georgia took her back

Found her down in Georgia
A country girl at heart
I told her that I loved her
And went and broke her heart
She just wanted to love me
And the little things we shared
Now she's gone back to Georgia
Because I didn't care

Georgia took her back
Georgia took her back
Georgia took my baby
Georgia took her back

Georgia took her back
Georgia took her back
Georgia took my baby
Georgia took her back

Going back toda
To Georgia, U.S.A
I really need that girl
I found that out today
If she'll have me back
I'll give her my name
I just can't hide the fact
Georgia won again

Georgia took her back
Georgia took her back
Georgia took my baby
Georgia took her back

Georgia took her back
Georgia took her back
Georgia took my baby
Georgia took her back

Georgia took her back
Georgia took her back
Georgia took my baby
Georgia took her back
