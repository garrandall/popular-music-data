Do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well
Here's the thing
I was minding my own business doin' what I do
I wasn't tryina look for anything
All of a sudden couldnt take my eyes off you
I didn't even know if you could tell
That you had me in a daze sayin' 'What the hell'
Here's my name, number baby just hit my cell
Loving everything you do 'cause you do it well

Don't know what you got me thinkin'
You ain't even tryina play me boy
'Cause you're so good, and you're so fine

Got me sayin' crazy things, listen
I ain't ever met a man like that (No)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well
I ain't ever met a man like that (No)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy you do it, do it
You do it, do it

You're doin' it well
Oh, yeah... hey
Let me tell you how it's gonna go
You and me, gonna need a little privacy
I don't wanna do the dance, no do-si-do
I'm a one woman man 7 days a week
Quit tryina play it cool boy make your move
I told you how it is, nothin' to lose
You been starin over here all night for free
And I ain't takin' no cash or credit, just a guarantee

There ain't nobody else but me boy
You ain't even tryina play me boy
'Cause you're so good, and you're so fine

Got me sayin' crazy things, listen
I ain't ever met a man like that (No)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well
I ain't ever met a man like that (No)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy you do it, do it
You do it, do it

You're doin' it well
Baby not lookin' for false pretenses
I think you just shocked me to my senses
Everything that you do feels right

Do it, do it
Do it, do it all night
Baby not lookin' for false pretenses

I think you just shocked me to my senses
Everything that you do feels right
Do it, do it
Do it, do it all night
I ain't ever met a man like that (No)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
'Cause you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well
I ain't ever met a man like that (No)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No)

You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well
I ain't ever met a man like that (No) (Like that)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No) (Like that)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well
I ain't ever met a man like that (No)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy you do it, do it
You do it, do it
You're doin' it well
