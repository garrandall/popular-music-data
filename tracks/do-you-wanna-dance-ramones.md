Do you wanna dance and hold my hand?
Squeeze me baby I'm your lover man
Oh baby, do you wanna dance?

Do you wanna dance under the moonlight?
Squeeze me baby all through the night
Oh baby, do you wanna dance?

Do you do you do you do you wanna dance
Do you do you do you do you wanna dance
Do you do you do you do you wanna dance

Do you wanna dance and hold my hand?
Squeeze me baby I'm your lover man
Oh baby, do you wanna dance?

Do you wanna dance under the moonlight?
Squeeze me baby all through the night
Oh baby, do you wanna dance?

Do you do you do you do you wanna dance
Do you do you do you do you wanna dance
Do you do you do you do you wanna dance

Do you do you do you do you wanna dance
Do you do you do you do you wanna dance
Do you do you do you do you wanna dance
Do you do you do you do you wanna dance
Do you do you do you do you wanna dance
Do you do you do you do you wanna dance
Do you do you do you do you wanna dance
Do you do you do you do you wanna dance
Do you do you do you do you wanna dance
