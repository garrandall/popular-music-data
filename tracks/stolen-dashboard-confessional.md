We watch the season pull up its own stakes
And catch the last weekend of the last week
Before the gold and the glimmer have been replaced
Another sun-soaked season fades away

You have stolen my heart
You have stolen my heart

Invitation-only grand farewells
Crush the best one of the best ones
Clear liquor and cloudy-eyed
Too early to say goodnight

You have stolen my heart
You have stolen my heart

And from the ballroom floor we are in celebration
One good stretch before our hibernation
Our dreams assured and we all will sleep well
Sleep well
Sleep well
Sleep well
Sleep well

You have stolen my
You have stolen my
You have stolen my heart

I watch you spin around in your highest heels
You are the best one of the best ones
We all look like we feel

You have stolen my
You have stolen my
You have stolen my heart
