I'm gonna do it darlin'
I could waste time tryin' to figure it out
But I'm jumpin' in anyhow
I've never been this far
Didn't know love could run so deep
Didn't know I'd lose this much sleep

Holdin' you close, chasin' that moon
Spendin' all night
Lovin' just who you are
Sparks flyin' in the dark
Shootin' out lights, huntin' down dreams
Figurin' out what love really means

Baby givin' you my heart
Is a real fine place to start
Something is goin' on
I can't explain but sure can touch
It's callin' both of us
Stronger than any fear or doubt

It's changing everything I see
It's changin' you, it's changin' me
Holdin' you close, chasin' that moon
Spendin' all night
Lovin' just who you are
Sparks flyin' in the dark

Shootin' out lights, runnin' down dreams
Figurin' out what love really means
Baby givin' you my heart
Is a real fine place to start
Right here, right now's the perfect spot, the perfect time
The perfect moment when your skin is next to mine

Yaa yaa yaa yaa
Holdin' you close, chasin' that moon
Spendin' all night
Lovin' just who you are
Sparks flyin' in the dark
Shootin' out lights, runnin' down dreams

Figurin' out just what love really means
Baby givin' you my heart
Is a real fine place
A real fine place to start
Oh, yeahhh
Oh, oh, oh
