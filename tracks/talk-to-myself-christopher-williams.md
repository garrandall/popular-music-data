No, come on, I said no
No means no now
I said no


I talk to myself
'Cause there is no one to talk to
People ask me why
Why I do what I do
I talk to myself
'Cause there is no one to talk to
People ask me why
Why I do what I do

People ask me why
I feel this way
Always alone
Day after day

Well, I used to be sweet
And I used to be kind
But I've been used and abused
For the last time

I just don't know
Why I do what I do
I can't let go
This feeling that I'm feeling



They think that I'm crazy
They say I'm strange
'Cause my attitude
Has taken a change

Well, it doesn't really matter
I really don't care
'Cause all of them
Can go to Hell

I just don't know
Why I do what I do
I can't let go
This feeling that I'm feeling
Solo

Yo, Chris (what)
You want to talk (no)
What do you want to do
(Kick it)

Talk to myself
This is how it started
People call me crazy
And think I'm retarded

Since you've been gone
I've been all alone
No one to talk to on the phone

Yeah, baby
I admit I was to blame
But since you've left
Life hasn't been the same

Since you've left
There's been no one else
So all I do is talk to myself

I can't let go
This feeling that I'm feeling
