High school U.S.A
High school U.S.A
High school U.S.A
High school U.S.A

High school U.S.A., come Friday noon
Bout a half past three
(High school U.S.A.)
I drop my books and my misery (high school U.S.A.)

Stroll up and down
Through the soda shop
(High school U.S.A.)
Drop a coin in the old jukebox (high school U.S.A.)

Well, now looking all around
What did I see every school kid
There could ever be
They come from Pittsburgh

Chicago and Boston too
New Orleans, San Diego
And old St. Lou
Cleveland, Portland, and L. A

Fort Worth, Charlotte
And Frisco Bay
Detroit, Newark and Memphis too
Well, they wanna do the high school bop with you

Well, come Saturday morning
They were still going strong
(High school U.S.A.)
They've been rocking and

A-rolling all night long
(High school U.S.A.)
No time to study on their ABC's
(High school U.S.A.)

Mmm they're getting their lessons
On the birds and the bees
(High school U.S.A.)
Yeah all across the floor

They're doing the hop
Everybody's doing that
High school bop
They come from Dallas

Cincinatti and good old Philly
Houston, Raleigh, and Kansas City
Miami, Baltimore and Washington
Norfolk, Atlanta and Charleston

Birmingham, Jacksonville
Tulsa too
Well, they wanna do the
High school bop with you

There was St. Paul
Nashville and San Antone
New York, Hartford, and Oklahome
Camden, Durham, Indianapolis, Buffalo, Tampa, Minneapolis

New Orleans
Columbus, Seattle too
They all wanna do the
High school bop with you

Mmm
Look out!
(High school U.S.A.)
(High school U.S.A.)
