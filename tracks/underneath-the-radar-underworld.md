Unknown unseen
We live underneath the radar
No sign on screen
We dance underneath the radar

Between the walls well hey
We're just too small to make a fuss about it
Did somethin' fall well hey
Where is the point in losin' sleep about it

See you later see you later
Hip uh no no no no uh hip uh no no no no
I see you later call me

We dance underneath the radar
We live underneath the bomb
When you live underneath the radar
There's no way that you're ever gonna get far
Huh huh huh so get hip

We speak unheard
Like ants we dance between the towers
We sleep they move
Come sailin' over the horizon

Between the walls well hey
We're just too small to make a fuss about it
Did somethin' fall well hey
Where is the point in losin' sleep about it

See you later see you later
Hip uh no no no no uh hip uh no no no no
I see you later call me

We dance underneath the radar
We live underneath the bomb
When you live underneath the radar
There's no way that you're ever gonna get far
We dance underneath the radar
We live underneath the bomb
When you live underneath the radar
There's no way that you're ever gonna get far
Huh huh huh so get hip

He says I am the doctor in a B 52
I come across the horizon drop my love on you
I'm gonna double you oh oh oh oh all watch out uh

See you later see you later
Hip uh no no no no uh hip uh no no no no
I see you later call me

We dance underneath the radar
We live underneath the bomb
When you live underneath the radar
There's no way that you're ever gonna get far
We dance underneath the radar
We live underneath the bomb
When you live underneath the radar
There's no way that you're ever gonna get far
Huh huh huh so get hip
