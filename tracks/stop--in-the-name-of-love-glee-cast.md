Here we go!
Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart (Free your mind!)
Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart, think it over

I wear tight clothing, high heeled shoes
It doesn't mean that I'm a prostitute, no no
I like rap music, wear hip hop clothes
That doesn't mean that I'm out sellin' dope, no no no

Before you can read me you gotta
Learn how to see me, I said

Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart (Free your mind!)
Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart, think it over
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color blind, don't be so shallow Think it over
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color blind, don't be so shallow

I've known of your
Your well secluded nights
I've even seen her
Maybe once or twice
But is her sweet expression
Worth more than my love and affection ?

Before you can read me you gotta
Learn how to see me, I said

Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart

Think it over

Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color blind, don't be so shallow Think it over
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color blind, don't be so shallow
Don't break my heart

Stop!
Stop! In the name of love
Free Your Mind
Stop!
Free Your Mind
Stop!
Free Your Mind

Before you can read me you gotta
Learn how to see me, I said

Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart (Free your Mind) 
Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart (Free Your Mind) 
Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart

Baby, think it over
Free Your Mind and the rest will stop!
