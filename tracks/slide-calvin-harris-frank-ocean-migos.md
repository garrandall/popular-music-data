I might empty my bank account
And buy that "Boy with a Pipe"
Buy that "Boy with a Pipe"
I might,
I might empty my bank account
And buy that "Boy with a Pipe"
Buy that "Boy with a Pipe"
I might

Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this?
I might put some spotlight on the side
Whatever comes, comes through clear
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this?
I might put some spotlight on the side
And whatever comes, comes through clear

All this jewelry ain't no use when it's this dark
It's my favorite part,
We see the lights, they got so far
It went too fast, we couldn't reach it with our arms
Wrist on a wrist, a link of charms,
Yeah
Laying, we're still a link apart
It's like we could die here all young
Like we could dye hair all blonde
If we could see in twenty twin
Twice we could see it 'til the end


Put that spotlight on her face, spotlight
Put that spotlight on her face, ah, yeah
We gon' pipe up and turn up, pipe up
We gon' light up and burn up, burn up
Mama too hot like a, like what?
Mama too hot like a furnace, furnace
I got a hundred Gs in my Goyard, Gs
My diamonds gonna shine when the lights dark, shine
You and I'll take a ride down the boulevard, yeah
And your friends really wanna break us apart
Good Lord


(Offset)
Good gracious
Starin' at my diamonds while I'm hoppin' out the spaceship
Need your information, take vacation to Malaysia (info)
You my baby,
The paparazzi flashin' crazy
She swallowed the bottle while I sit back and smoke gelato
Walk in my mansion. 20 thousand paintings. Picasso
Bitches be dippin', dabbin' with niggas like a nacho
Took off her panties, diamonds dancin' like Rick Ricardo
She havin' it
Went to college, workin' on her bachelor
I know you got a past, I got a past, that's in the back of us
Average, I'mma make a million on the average
I'm ridin' with no brain, bitch, I'm out of it


Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this?
I might put some spotlight on the slide, oh, yeah
Whatever comes, comes through clear
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this?
Put some spotlight on the side
And whatever comes, comes through clear

I might empty my bank account
And buy that "Boy with a Pipe"
Buy that "Boy with a Pipe" (Come on, yeah)
I might, (Come on, yeah, slide it)
I might empty my bank account (Oh, light it)
And buy that "Boy with a Pipe" (Slide, yeah)
(Do you slide on all your nights like this?)
Buy that "Boy with a Pipe"
I might
