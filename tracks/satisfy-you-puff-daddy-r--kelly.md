All I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me
Somebody I can love for them
All this money don't mean shit
If you ain't got nobody to share it with
Love rules the world, you feel me

He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

When it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame
Get them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner
Do what you want, it's your thing girl, I persist and try but
We one in the same girl, it ain't a game
So I can't play with you, I wanna lay with you
Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you
In good and bad times, we'll always make it through
Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it
Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer
Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to
Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you
Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier

Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy
Feel emptiness inside? I can fill that void
When you spend time with your woman and listen
It shines more than any bagguette diamond can glisten
I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth
Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt
And prove to you you're more important than anything else
Worthwhile, special like my first child
When I see your face it's always like the first time
Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri-jet
I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet
Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you
Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to
Let it be known, I told you
And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true

Don't let him sing you a sad song (No baby)
Waiting for love like this too long
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby)
All that you need I can give you
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on)
I do, satisfy you
(You don't have to wait on him)

I'm the light when you can't see
I'm that air when you can't breathe
I'm that feeling when you can't leave
Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive
So it's only you and me
When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong
I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong
Keep you away from harm, my love is protected
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected
I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare
In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared
Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you
Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you
Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil
Make love all night, bending bed coils
You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal
This is all for you, cause I simply adore you

This one right here goes out to all my sisters
