Hsss ugh
I gotta be real wit' you, baby
Just gotta let you know

You've got the love that I want (That's right)
The love that I need (Word is bond, it's butta, baby)
(Check this out)

You're like my homie, my shorty, you've shown me so many things
And you're so special to me
We been kickin' it for a while, your sexy smile, Prima Donna style
Oh you're drivin' me so wild (so wild)

Ain't got no reputation, educated conversation
And, oh you've got that bomb love makin'
It's more than sexual, this love you know, is proper dough
It's, oh, so, so incredible

You've got the love that I want (The love you want)
And you've got the love that I need (The love you need)
Girl, it's so smooth and so creamy (You know, you know)
You've got that butta love, baby (You've got that butta love, baby)

You've got the love that I want (The love you want)
And you've got the love that I need (The love you need)
Girl, it's so smooth and so creamy
You've got that butta love, oh, baby

You've got it goin' on, word is bond, sundress with platforms
Feet pedicure with no corns
You've got that sex appeal, on the real, so sure
Soft hands, French manicure, no makeup, you're so pure

You don't be trippin' when I'm kickin' it with my niggas
You don't be questionin' where I been and what I did
You got that confidence, sexiness, thickness, that bomb shit
And I like it oh.

When I'm chillin' with my homies (Think about it)
I think about you only
(You know what I want) You got what I want
(You know what it is) It's that (Oh butta love
(All you got to do) Just hit me on my hip baby
(And I will, I will) I'll meet you at your crib, baby
'Cause I'll rock your world, I'll rock you, girl
Butta babe, butta, babe

You've got the love that I want (The love you want)
You've got the love that I need, yeah (The love you need)
Girl, it's so smooth and so creamy
You've got that butta love, baby

You've got the love that I want (The love you want) (You know you do)
And you've got the love that I need (That love, that love) (The love you
need) (Oh, yeah)
Girl, it's so smooth and so creamy
You've got that butta love, oh, baby (You've got that, you've got that butta
love)

You've got those sexy eyes, enticing thighs, you make me rise
(You've got that love I wanna try, send my tongue up and down your spine)
You've got that perfect shape, the love you make, I scream your name
(Wanna take all your clothes off, sex you till the song goes off)

I like your everything, your navel and your pinky ring
(Sexy from head to toe, girl, never gonna let you go)
You got that confidence, sexiness, thickness that bomb play
And I like it all, yeah.

You've got it goin' on, word is bomb, baby
You've got that sex appeal, on the real, lady
You're like my homie, my shorty, huh
You've got that butta love

You've got it goin' on, don't you know, that's for sure
I like your face and hands and all of your pretty toes
Baby, you're so right, you're locked tight
You've got that butta love, oh

I want it, I need it
