Come back, you know I miss you
Got to hold you once again in my life

It's late, it's quiet
A taxi waits at the door
Footsteps, a door slams
What's going on, it's quarter to four

So many times, so many tears
So many words unspoken
So many doubts, so many fears
So many hearts are broken

'Cause I'm lonely and I miss you tonight (come back)
Got to hold you again in my life (come back)
'Cause I'm lonely and I need you tonight (come back)
Got to hold you again in my life (come back)

The phone keeps ringing
Are you there with a friend
I call back, it's busy
I'll hang up and try once again

So many times, so many tears
So many words unspoken
So many doubts, so many fears
So many hearts are broken

'Cause I'm lonely and I miss you tonight (come back)
Got to hold you again in my life (come back)
'Cause I'm lonely and I need you tonight (come back)
Got to hold you again in my life (come back)

And a whoa, hoe

So many times, so many tears
So many words unspoken
So many doubts, so many fears
So many hearts are broken

'Cause I'm lonely and I miss you tonight (come back)
Got to hold you again in my life (come back)
'Cause I'm lonely and I need you tonight (come back)
Got to hold you again in my life (come back)

I'm lonely and I miss you tonight (come back)
Got to hold you again in my life (come back)
I'm lonely and I need you tonight (come back)
Got to hold you again in my life (come back)

(Love you, miss you, need you, want you back in my life)
Come back, baby come back
(Love you, miss you, need you, want you back in my life)
Come back, hey, come on, come on back
(Love you, miss you, need you, want you back in my life)
Take a boat, take a train, take the airplane, just come on back, yeah, yeah, come on back
(Love you, miss you, need you, want you back in my life)
I don't care, I don't care how you do it, come on back baby
(Love you, miss you, need you, want you back in my life)
