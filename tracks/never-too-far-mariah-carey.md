You're with me
Til the bitter end
What we had transcends 
This experience 
Too painful to 
Talk about 
So I'll hold it in 
Til my heart can mend 
And be brave enough to love again 

A place in time 
Still belongs to us 
Stays preserved in my mind 
In the memories there is solace 

Never too far away 
I won't let time erase 
One bit of yesterday 
Cause I have learned that 
Nobody can take your place 
Though we can never be 
I'll keep you close to me 
When I remember 

Glittering lights 
Incandescent eyes 
Still preserved 
In my mind 
In the memories I'll find solace 

Never too far away 
I won't let time erase 
One bit of yesterday 
And I have learned that 
Nobody can take your place 
Though we can never be 
I'll keep you close to me 
And I'll remember 

A place in time 
Still belongs to us 
Stays preserved in my mind 
In the memories there is solace 

Never too far away 
I won't let time erase 
One bit of yesterday 
Cause I have learned that 
Nobody can take your place 
And though we can never be 
I'll always think of you and me 
Always remember 

Love 

You're never too far
