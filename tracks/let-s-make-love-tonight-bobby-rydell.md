Would you like to be kissed
In the moonlight
A touch of my lips
Will thrill your heart

This is a night
Just made for lovers
So let's make love tonight

Kiss me, dear
And hold me tight
Look around and you will see

Signs of love
Sounds of young lovers
So let's make love tonight

Let's not resist
What we feel inside
A moment like this
Is a moment in paradise

So, kiss me now
The time is right
Tell me now
How much you love me

This is a night
Just made for lovers
So let's make love tonight

This is a night
Just made for lovers
So let's make love tonight
So let's make love tonight
