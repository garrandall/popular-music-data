I want to know, I want to know, I just got to know
Why do you always play around?
If you, if you have the same feeling for me
Then why don't you settle down?


I want to know
I want to know I just got to know


I think you want me for conveniency
If I'm wrong please tell me right
I know, I know I been in the dark a long time
But some day I will see the light


And I want to know
I want to know, I just got to know


It takes you to prove you love me
You can prove it sure as the world is round
But from, but from your ways and actions
I have a feeling you have let me down


I want to know
I want to know, I just got to know
I want to know
I want to know, I just got to know
