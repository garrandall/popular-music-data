You there, on the corner, you're making the sick survive
You look a lot like lad I knew when I was a child of five
And now I see you're leading me and the people to a heavenly end
But I don't forget a friend, didn't I know you when?

Didn't I know you when you were
Pellin' papers, door to door
Didn't I know you when you were a neighbor?
Well, Jack, jump back
You may look different, but it's a fact
That I don't forget a friend, didn't I know you when?

And you there, his disciple, you're passin' the hat around
You're braggin' about the life you lived, while you're braggin' about the life you found
You may have been livin' in sin, runnin' from the arms of the law
But you may have been my friend, didn't I know you when?

Didn't I know you when you were
Waitin' tables, sweepin' the floor
Didn't I know you when you were a neighbor?
Well, Jack, jump back
You may look different, but it's a fact
That I don't forget a friend, didn't I know you when?

Seems to me you used to love the ladies
Playin' Louie, Louie in the band
But isn't life strange, Lord how some people change
Sanctify me, Lord baptize me, tell me what's your name

Didn't I know you when you were
Waitin' tables, sweepin' the floor
Didn't I know you when you was a neighbor?
Well, Jack, jump back
You may look different, but it's a fact
That I don't forget a friend, didn't I know you when?

Didn't I know you when you were
Pellin' papers, door to door
Didn't I know you when you were a neighbor?
Well, Jack, shucks
You may look different, but it's a fact
That I don't forget a friend, didn't I know you when?
