The world "talkin" 'bout the world belongs to you 
It belongs to yo 
The world 
I know I know I know 
Belongs to me 
It belongs to me 
I'm ready for the eighty's glad to be alive 
I'm waiting for those magic numbers to arrive 
I've got myself together got myself in gear 
I'm gonna be the first out there,to greet those 
Fabulous year 

I'm ready for the eighty's, I'm ready for the eighty's 
Ready for the time of my life 
Are you ready

'Cause I'm ready for you,honey 
'Cause I'm ready for you

Ready for the time of my life 

Are you ready for me 
Are you ready for me 
'Cause I'm ready for you,baby 
'Cause I'm ready for you 
Take my dream and hitch it to a star 
In the eighty's we will travel far 
We will realize just who we are 
We can move as one 

Baby,I'm ready,... 
And baby I'll be waiting for you 

Listen to me baby

There's hope in ev'ry heart and love on ev'ry face 
The eighty's promise ev'rything is just gonna be great

We'll be loving in the bright sunshine

And I want to share it all with you 
Give the universe a different view we'll communicate
