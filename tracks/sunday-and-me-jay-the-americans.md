Her eyes would make an angel smile
They'd call her Sunday
She'll take a man and drive him wild
Her name is Sunday

And one day I'm gonna make her mine
It's gonna be so fine, you wait and see
It's gonna be just Sunday and me

There's not a star that shines as bright
Her name is Sunday
She'll take the dark out of the night
They call her Sunday

And one day I'm gonna take her home
Tell the world that she's my own, you'll wait and see
It's gonna be just Sunday and me

Sunday
Sunday

Oh, I see bells and wedding gowns
When I see Sunday
You know I dream of walkin' down
The aisle with Sunday

And one day, it's gonna come for sure
The day that I've been livin' for, you'll wait and see
It's gonna be just Sunday and me

Sunday
Sunday
