Three steps from the altar
(Three steps, by step, by step)
Here's your chance to change your mind
Remember forever
Is a very long time

(Walking step by step, by step)
Two steps from the altar
Please don't ever?
Everyone's?
They are happy for a?
Last night our last date

Don't look back at your mother
(She is standing there)
For she will only cry
She gave us her blessing
That's all she could do
And she knows that I'll take care of you

(Walking step by step, by step)
One step from the altar
Now we make our vows
Your father stepped back, and said
You take over now, you take over now
