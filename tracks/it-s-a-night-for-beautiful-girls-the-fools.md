It's a night, oh yeah
For beautiful girls

It's a night, yes it is
For beautiful girls

Something's gonna happen here tonight
I can feel it
Stay with me 'til mornin'
I really need it

It's a night, oh yeah
For beautiful girls

It's a night, woh woh woh
For beautiful girls

Girls girls girls girls girls everywhere
Girls girls girls girls girls, in my hair

Goin' to a nightclub
And I peek under the table
Maybe find some legs down there
That look like Betty Grable

It's a night, oh yeah
For beautiful girls

What is it
It's a night, it's a night
For beautiful girls

Goin' to a nightclub
And I drink some more tequila
Maybe find some legs down there
I can give a little feel-a

It's a night, oh yeah
For beautiful girls

What is it
It's a night, it's a night
For beautiful girls

It's a night

It's a night

It's a night
