I know the reason you've been crying
Oh yes I heard she won't be needing you
How does it feel being the one left behind
What's a matter baby is it hurting you
I know you found out she's been cheating
And I heard she even told you she was untrue
How does it feel being on the outside looking in
What's a matter baby is it hurting you
Remember
Remember when I needed you so bad
Remember
Remember what you had to say
You told me to find another shoulder to cry on
Then you laughed
You laughed and you walked away
I know that you've been asking about me (ha-ha)
And I'm sorry but I've got somebody new
Now my hurting is just about over
But baby it's just starting for you!
