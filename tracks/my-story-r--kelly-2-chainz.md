This is my story. Yeah, I'm from that Chi-town dirt.
I went from being broke to sleeping in Versace shirts.
This is my story. Money, cars, bad hoes.
This is my story.

And I'm stickin' to it. 

.
Came from humble beginnings.
Now, I'm cocky with my spending.
They say, "Life is just a game,"
And I thank God that I'm winning.

Models roll my indo.
I beat the pussy. Django.
Them niggas talking money.
I got more digits in my gate code.

She make a pole disappear like hocus pocus.
You're ain't never gon' find another nigga this focused.
I got every block, every street corners sold-up.
Whatever club represent my city, throw it up.

I own the game. Coach slash player shown up.
OK. Haters forfeited. Never showed up.


This is my story. Yeah, I'm from that Chi-town dirt.
I went from being broke to sleeping in Versace shirts.
This is my story. Money, cars, bad hoes.
This is my story.

And I'm stickin' to it. 

.
Yeah, 2 Chainz.
Velcro. I'm sticking to it.
Hating. I've been a victim to it.
Your conversation is sanitation.
Ain't no hesitation
When I finna do it.

I stick it in. Uh.
Switch it up and try to hit a friend. Uh.
Live it up and count my dividends.
Roll like cinnamon.
Whoa.

Big-face Benjamins
As she lookin' at me like ye'en ain't nothin' but a star
I looked at her like this ain't nothin' but a car.
If you ride with them you ain't going that far,
But if you ride with me...

Crib so big
We can play hide-and-seek.
You can confide to me,
Ride me like I ride the beat.
Pilot seat.

I need a co-pilot.
Kiss a ass in both mouths.
Them talking both lips.
What you know 'bout boat trips?

Drop her ass at the Chocolate Factory. Yeah.
We did them 12 Play's. yeah.
And you know who you is, girl.
We been fuckin' since the 12th grade.
Goddamn.


This is my story. Yeah, I'm from that Chi-town dirt.
I went from being broke to sleeping in Versace shirts.
This is my story. Money, cars, bad hoes.
This is my story.

And I'm stickin' to it. 


Pull up to the club at about three.
I'm killin' it. Guilty. No plea.
I'm leaving out at six with a dime piece.
By nine o'clock, we on round three.

I speak of rain. They say I'm crazy like they didn't know.
See, I'm not crazy, but my talent, man, got bipolar.
Say she's a church girl, but, man, she's blowing holy smokes.
Showed her the Jesus piece. Now, she got the Holy Ghost.

They asked them in a interview, "Why do he love these girls?"
The only thing he had to say was, "Motherfuck the world!"


This is my story. Yeah, I'm from that Chi-town dirt.
I went from being broke to sleeping in Versace shirts.
This is my story. Money, cars, bad hoes.
This is my story.

And I'm stickin' to it.
