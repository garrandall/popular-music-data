Another ringer with the slick trigger finger
For Her Majesty
Another one with the golden tongue
Poisoning your fantasy
Another bill from a killer turned a thriller
To a tragedy


Yeah
A door left open
A woman walking by
A drop in the water
A look in your eye
A phone on the table
A man on your side
Or someone that you think that you can trust
It's just
Another way to die

Another tricky little gun giving solace to the one
That'll never see the sun shine
Another inch of your life sacrificed for your brother
In the nick of time
Another dirty money heaven sent honey
Turning on a dime



(It's just another)
Hey!
(It's just another)
You're nothing to me die
(It's just another)
Shoot 'em up bang bang

Another girl with her finger on the world
Singing to you what you wanna hear
Another gun thrown down in surrender
Took away your fear
Another man there he stands right behind you
Looking in the mirror



It's just another
It's just another
It's just another way
Shoot 'em up, bang bang
Hey Hey
It's just another
Yeah Yeah

It's just another
It's just another
It's just another
It's just another day

Bang bang bang bang
