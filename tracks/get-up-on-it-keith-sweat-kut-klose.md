I got something for the fellas this time around
Lady's, won't you tell me your names
Tabath, Avina and Lavan

If you really, really want it
All you got to do is get up on it
If you really, really want it
All you got to do is get up on it

The time has come for us, oh baby
To get real busy baby, oh yes, it has, umm
And you don't have to be afraid of our love, oh no
'Cause it won't hurt you sugar
Oh no, it won't, oo yeah, baby

If you really, really want it
All you got to do is get up on it
If you really, really want it
All you got to do is get up on it

I like it girl when we can get real freaky baby
Oh yes, I do baby
And I'm on my hands and knees
You know I'm with you sugar
Girl, I am with everything you want to do, sang

If you really, really want it
All you got to do is get up on it
If you really, really want it
All you got to do is get up on it

Boy yeah, I know that this is it, a love
'Cause I know that I'm giving you my love
Love, love, a love that you can't resist, baby
Sang, sang, bring it on

If you really, really want it
All you got to do is get up on it
If you really, really want it
All you got to do is get up on it

Ho baby yeah
I know that this is it, boy
And I'm giving you my love
Don't leave me baby, ho oh
Yeah baby
Oh boy, I know, I know, I know
I know I'm giving you, I'm giving you all my love, baby
Oh love, nothing can resist
I wanna lift you up and down, oh baby
I want you take me, take me, take your time
I want you to take your time with me
