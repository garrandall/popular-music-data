I was born in Lil' Rock
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I wore hightop shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pigtails
I knew I loved her even then


You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boo-hooed it
But I told them time and time again
"Don't you know I was made to love her
Build my world all around her"
Yeah! Hey, hey, hey


She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years


I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey, hey, hey


All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby, hey
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere


I was knee-high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there


'Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her, yeah!
Ah, I was made to love her
Build my world all around her
Hey, hey, hey
Oh baby, I was made to please her
You know Stevie ain't gon' leave her, no
Hey, hey, hey, ohwee, baby
