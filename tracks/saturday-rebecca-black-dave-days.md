(Oh my god, I love this song. This is my jam! Where is the peanut butter?)

2pm, getting out of my bed
Tryin to get Friday out of my head
It's all so hazy, got a little too crazy
You know I'd do it all again

Call everyone you know
turn up the radio
'cause this is our song
we can do no wrong
Are you ready, are you ready to go?
This saturday, we gon' party all night
One we will remember for the rest of our lives
This Saturday, we gon' do it bigger than, we ever had before
I don't want this Saturday to end 

(Brrpt, brrpt, "Hello?" "Hey, come over." "Alright, alright, I'll be right over, I just gotta find my...pants.")

Rollin' up in my new scene
Want you here right next to me
'cause this our night, ain't got no deadlines
There's nowhere else I'd rather be

Call everyone you know
Turn up the radio
'cause this is our song
We can do no wrong
Are you ready, are you ready to go?
This saturday, we gon' party all night
One we will remember for the rest of our lives
This saturday, we gon' do it bigger than, we ever had before
I don't want this saturday to end 

Yesterday was Friday, today is Saturday
We gonna live like theres no tomorrow
Wouldn't have it any other way

Yesterday was Friday, today is Saturday
We gonna live like theres no tomorrow
Wouldn't have it any other way

This Saturday, we gon' party all night
One we will remember for the rest of our lives
This Saturday, we gon' do it bigger than, we ever had before
I don't want this Saturday to end 

This Saturday, we gon' party all night
I don't want this Saturday to end
This Saturday, we gon' party all night
I don't want this Saturday to end
