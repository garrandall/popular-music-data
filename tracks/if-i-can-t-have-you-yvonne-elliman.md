Don't know why I'm surviving every lonely day
When there's got to be no chance for me
My life would end

And it doesn't matter how I cry
My tears of love are a waste of time
If I turn away

Am I strong enough to see it through?
Go crazy is what I will do


If I can't have you, I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh


Can't let go, and it doesn't matter how I try
I gave it all so easily
To you my love

To dreams that never will come true
Am I strong enough to see it through?
Go crazy is what I will do


If I can't have you, I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh
Oh, If I can't have you, I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh
If I can't have you, I don't want...
