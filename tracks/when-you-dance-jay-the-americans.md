When you dance be sure to hold her, hold her tight
When you dance you'll squeeze her, yes, with all your might
Such a thrill, oh, when she's close to you
Well, hold her tight when you dance

When you dance you'll feel the warmth of her embrace
Then you'll know this feeling, yeah, is no disgrace
Such a thrill, oh, when she's close to you
Well, hold her tight when you dance

You may do a rumba or a tango
Mambo, calypso or a strand
Lights are turned down low
You go hand and...

When you dance be sure to hold her tight
When you dance you'll squeeze her, yes, with all your might
Such a thrill, oh, when she's close to you
Hold her tight

When you dance be sure to hold her, hold her tight
When you dance you'll squeeze her, yes, with all your might
Such a thrill, oh, when she's close to you
Well, hold her tight when you dance
