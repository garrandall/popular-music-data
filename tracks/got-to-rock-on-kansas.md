It's no funny hanging around
Winter seems so numbing
Getting fat where I sit down
Do you suppose it's old age coming

I get this feeling I'm no good for nothing
Life has led me wrong
Once in a while it makes it all worthwhile
If I can sing this song

I got to rock on I can't be this way
I'm hanging around but wait till music's in season
That's when I'm high that is how I play
And I do it the best that's all I need for a reason

Can't think straight, can't think at all
Staring out the window
Hear the band, I hear them call
Everything will disappear and

I get the feeling I can conquer
Anything gets in my way
Well I don't need no doctor 'cause I
Know exactly what I need today

I got to rock on I can't be this way
I'm hanging around but wait till music's in season
That's when I'm high that is how I play
And I do it the best that's all I need for a reason

The sun beats down upon me and it looks
As tough that spring has waited long enough to get here
She knows that I must sing about her future
Oh, sing about her past, I love to play my music
And I try to make it last, sometimes summer comes too fast

I got to rock on I can't be this way
I'm hanging around, wait till music's in season
That's when I'm high that is how I play
And I do it the best that's all

I got to rock on I can't be this way
I'm hanging around wait till music's in season
That's when I'm high that is how I play, hey, yeah

I got to rock on I can't be this way
That's when I'm high that is how I play
And I do it the best that's all I
