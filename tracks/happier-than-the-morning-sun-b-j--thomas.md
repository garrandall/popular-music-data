Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom

I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life

I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life

All my life I was alone
Didn't think I'd find my part
Now I see there's joy inside your arms

Every day I searched for the star
That never was in the sky
And now I see this star is on earth

And I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that I would be
That's what you told me, yeah
If I gave you a chance to come inside my life

(I am)
And I am happier than the morning sun
And that's the way it will always be
That's the way it will always be
Ever since the day you came inside of my life

Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom, I love you
Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom, I love you

Dum, dum, yeah

And I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said that it would be
Baby, that's what you told me, yeah
If I should ever bring you inside my life
Bring you inside my life

I'm happier than the morning sun
And that's the way you said it would be
Woah, that's what you said it would be
If I should ever bring you inside my life

Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom, I love you

Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom
Bom, bom, bom, I love you

Happier than the morning sun
That's the way you said it would be
Baby, that's what you told me, yeah
If I should ever bring you inside my life
Bring you inside my life, yeah

I'm happier than the stars above
Yeah, the morning stars above
That's the way you said that it would be
That's what you told me, yeah
If I should ever bring you inside of my life

I believe that everyone should be
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun
Happier than the morning sun
Happy happy, happy
