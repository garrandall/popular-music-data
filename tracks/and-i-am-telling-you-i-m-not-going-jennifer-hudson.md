And I am telling you
I'm not going
You're the best man I'll ever know
There's no way I can ever go
No, no, there's no way
No, no, no, no way I'm living without you
I'm not living without you
I don't wanna be free
I'm staying, I'm staying
And you, and you
You're gonna love me
You're gonna love me

And I am telling you I'm not going
Even though the rough times are showing
There's just no way, there's no way
We're part of the same place
We're part of the same time
We both share the same blood
We both have the same mind

And time and time, we've had so much to see and
No, no, no, no, no, no way
I'm not waking up tomorrow morning
And finding that there's nobody there

Darling there's no way
No, no, no, no way I'm living without you
I'm not living without you
You see there's just no way, there's no way

Please don't go away from me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay, stay and hold me
Stay, stay and hold me

Please stay and hold me, Mr. Man
Try it Mr, try it Mr
I know, I know, I know you can

Tear down the mountains
Yell, scream and shout like you can say what you want
I'm not walking out
Stop all the rivers
Push, strike and kill
I'm not gonna leave you
There's no way I will

And I am telling you I'm not going
You're the best man I'll ever know
There's no way I could ever, ever go
No, no, no, no way
No, no, no, no way I'm living without you
I'm not living without you, not living without you
I don't wanna be free
I'm staying, I'm staying
And you, and you, and you
You're gonna love me
You're gonna love me
Yes you are, yes you are
Love me, love me
Love me, love me, love
You're gonna love me
