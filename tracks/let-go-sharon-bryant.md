Hey, yeah, oh, oh

I've been searching
Searching for so long
For that special guy
I can call my own
I never realized love could
Be so hard to find, ooh

I need a lover
A lover with a steady hand
Need somebody
Somebody who will understand
The one who could soon
Give me what I need

(CHORUS)
I need (someone who)
Can make me feel all right
(Someone who)
Can take me through the night
(Someone who)
Can make my feelings show
(Someone who)
Can make me just let go

I wanna lose my self control
All I wanna do is let go
And let all my emotions explode
I've got to let it go

I've been waiting
I can't wait no longer
I've been patient but I
Need something stronger
Wanna find the kind of
Feeling that I can't deny

It's gotta be just right
Something close to dynamite
Too tough, I never wanna get enough
I need to release what I'm feeling inside

(CHORUS)

I wanna lose my self control
All I wanna do is let go
And let all my emotions explode
I've got to let it, got to let it go

Got to let it go, mmm
Yeah. let, let, let go
Let, let, let go
Got to let it, got to let it go
Let go, let, let, let go
Got to let it, got to let it go

(CHORUS)

Let go
And let all my emotions explode
I've got to let it, got to let go

I wanna lose my self control
All I wanna do is let go
And let all my emotions explode
Got to let it, got to let it go

I wanna lose, wanna lose
All I wanna do is let go
And let all my emotions explode

Let go
I need someone to help me let go
Let me feel free, free and easy

Let go
Let all my emotions explode
I wanna let go
Let go
Let all my emotions explode
I wanna let go...
