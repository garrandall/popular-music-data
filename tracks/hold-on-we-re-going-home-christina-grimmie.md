I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your high love and emotion, endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your high love and emotion, endlessly


'Cause you're a good boy and you know it
You act so different around me
'Cause you're a good boy and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on we're going home, ah, ha-ah, ha-ha
Just hold on we're going home, ah, ha-ah, ha-ha
It's hard to do these things alone, ah, ha-ah, ha-ha
Just hold on we're goin' home, ah, ha-ah, ha-ha


You're the one, you're the one
Gave you everything I love
I think there's something, baby
I think there's something


I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your high love and emotion, endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your high love and emotion
Endless, endlessly


'Cause you're a good boy and you know it
I know exactly who you could be, yeah
Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home
