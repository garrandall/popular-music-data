Countdown - countdown - countdown - countdown
Countdown - countdown - countdown - countdown, countdown, oh oh
(Countdown) Well, well, well, well
(Countdown) Ah, well, well, well, well
(Countdown) Counting every minute you're away
(Countdown, countdown, oh oh)

I got to get a hold of this burning desire, oh baby, oh yeah
I got to keep me from catching on fire, oh baby ooh yeah
You've been gone, and I'm all alone
I need you and can't wait for you to come home
I'm spinning my wheels, don't know what I can do
All I can think of is you, you, you

(Countdown) I'm counting down, I'm counting down
(Countdown) Oh yeah, counting every hour
(Countdown) Ooh, every beat of my heart
Countdown, countdown, oh oh
(Countdown) Ah, it's a countdown, countdown
(Countdown) Ooh, just watching time go by
(Countdown) I want you back in my arms, yeah
(Countdown, countdown) in my arms again

Anticipating the moment with you, oh baby, oh yeah
Trying to forget that I'm losing my sleep, oh baby, oh yeah
Time moves too slow, and I'm caught in a dream
Is this nightmare as bad as it seems
I'm pulling my hair, I can't lose control
I miss you so much, don't you know

(Ooh the countdown - ooh the countdown - ooh the countdown - ooh the countdown)
Time goes on too slowly, when you miss the one you love
Ooh I'm counting every minute, counting every second, every beat of your heart
There must be a reason for feeling this way
I wish that I knew, 'cause I'd change it today
If it's true love, then I'll just have to wait
I can't be changing my plans all day?
I just keep standing in front of your door
Thinking I'll see you, wishing for more
Soon you'll be back, and calling my name
Then I'll be saved, from going insane
Save me, save me, save me

(Countdown - countdown - countdown - countdown, countdown, oh oh)
(Countdown) oh, I'm hungry for your love
(Countdown) oh, I'm hungry for your love
(Countdown) ooh, I need so bad I can taste it, I can taste it
(Countdown) oh...
(Countdown) oh, oh, oh
(Countdown) oh, oh, oh
(Countdown, countdown, oh, oh)

I need love - I need love
Bring me your love - give me love
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh I'm all ready, oh I can't stand it
Can't stand, to count it down one more day, one more day, hey
Can't stand it, the wait, I'm waiting, waiting, anticipating
Oh, I'm waiting for you baby
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, yeah - Oh, oh, hoo, hoo
I'm hungry for your love - I'm hungry for your love
I'm hungry for your love - I'm hungry for your love

This is it, this is the moment I've been waiting for
Hold me even tighter, I need your loving more
You're the one I adore, you more than satisfy, oh oh oh
This is it, this is the time and the place for love
Ooh we got this fast to a heaven above?
Ooh leave your troubles behind - Love is yours and mine
This is my destiny, that you're so right for me
And then I give to you a feeling so true, when you're here next to me
Ooh, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I, ooh I do
And you know all the while, it's making me smile
Before you returned, I know why I yearned

This is it, this is the top of the world for me
Oh, we get to act out our fantasy
Make it reality - and fly it to the Moon
And love will play the tune

Ah, this is it, this is it, this is love, love, love
Ah, this is it, this is it, this is love, love, love
Oh, this is it, this is it, this is love, love, love

You give me so much of all this is you
But when you're away sometimes I get blue, I miss you
Oh I start the countdown again
(Countdown) Counting every, every hour
(Countdown) Ooh, every, every, every, ooh
(Countdown) Ooh, every beat of my heart
(Countdown) Ah, every beat of my heart
(Countdown) I'm count every second your away
(Countdown) I want you so bad baby I can taste it
I'm hungry for your love, I'm hungry for your love, I'm hungry for your love
Oh, softly tell me me baby, just one more time
I know we 
But we got something better baby, right here
So touch me with your loving, touch me with your hugging
Touch me with emotion, touch me with devotion
Touch me with passion, touch me with ease
Touch me with everything, touch me please
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I, ooh I do
Oh baby, oh baby, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, this is love, love, love
This is it (this is it)
This is it (this is it)
This is love, love, love

Oh, this is it now, this is it now, this is love, love, love
Oh, this is it now, this is it now, this is love, love, love

Oh, get together lovers, come on everybody, rejoice
Take hand in hand, ooh, raise your voices
You've got to sing with me, now
The world loves love, oh, yeah, oh
You know, instant replay forever, oh
