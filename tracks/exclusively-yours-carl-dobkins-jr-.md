No more playing the field for me
Since I met you, my heart's not free
I just wanna be exclusively yours

Once you kissed me, I found out
There's no other I care about
I just wanna be exclusively yours

I'll take you to the dance
I'll take you to the show
I'll take you every single place
You ever wanna go

I don't care where it is
I don't care what we do
As long as I can just
Be there with you

If it's my love you're longing for
You can have it forever more
I just wanna be exclusively yours

I'll take you to the dance
I'll take you to the show
I'll take you every single place
You ever wanna go

I don't care where it is
I don't care what we do
As long as I can just
Be there with you

If it's my love you're longing for
You can have it forever more
I just wanna be exclusively yours

I just wanna be exclusively yours
