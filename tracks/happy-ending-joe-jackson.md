I'm in a movie where boy meets girl
What happens to me in this brave new world?
Do I listen to my heart, do I listen to my head?
Do I look at what I see, or remember what I read?
When I tell you how I feel, do I wonder what I've said?
Is there nothing we can do about it?

Anyone
Anyone can be so hard hearted
But everyone
Still everybody wants a happy ending

It's not so easy, it's '84 now
How tough must we be to ask for more now?
Do I listen to my head, do I listen to my heart?
Do I try to feel the same as I feel when we're apart?
Do I think about the end when it's only just the start?
Is there nothing we can do about it?

Anyone
Anyone can be so hard hearted
But everyone
Still everybody wants a happy ending

I get so scared when I see the evidence against our case
Each movie so far this year ends up with someone crying
Or even someone dying

Do I listen to my head, do I listen to my heart?
Do I try to feel the same as I feel when we're apart?
Do I think about the end when it's only just the start?
Is there nothing we can do about it?

Anyone
Anyone can be so hard hearted
But everyone
Still everybody wants a happy ending
