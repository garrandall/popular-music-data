You say that's your boyfriend
You say I'm out of line
Funny, he said I could call him up anytime
You can say I'm wrong say I ain't right
But if that's your boyfriend he wasn't last night
I'm the kind of woman
I'll do almost anything to get what I want
I might play any little game
Call me what you like but you know it's true
You're just jealous cause he wasn't with you
Don't mean no harm I just like what I see
And it ain't my fault if he wants me
Got what I wanted and the feeling was right
So if that's your boyfriend he wasn't last night


Boyfriend boyfriend yes I had your boyfriend
If that's your boyfriend if that's your boyfriend
If that's your boyfriend
He wasn't last night
Boyfriend boyfriend yes I had your boyfriend
If that's your boyfriend if that's your boyfriend
If that's your boyfriend
He wasn't last night


Now late at night he calls me on the telephone
That's why when you call
All you get is the busy busy tone
You're upset cause you're one stuck-up bitch
Maybe he needed a change a switch
And who am I not to oblige
Especially if the man is fly
So call me what you like
Call me what you like
While I boot slam your boyfriend tonight


Boyfriend boyfriend yes I had your boyfriend
If that's your boyfriend if that's your boyfriend
If that's your boyfriend
He wasn't last night
Boyfriend boyfriend yes I had your boyfriend
If that's your boyfriend if that's your boyfriend
If that's your boyfriend
He wasn't last night
Boyfriend boyfriend yes I had your boyfriend
If that's your boyfriend if that's your boyfriend
If that's your boyfriend
He wasn't last night
Boyfriend boyfriend yes I had your boyfriend
If that's your boyfriend if that's your boyfriend
If that's your boyfriend
He wasn't last night


Ohohbaby baby
Good to the last chip at the bottom of the bag
Oh baby baby
Make you wanna do things that you never have
Oh baby baby
Mad sex and when we're through
I really have no problem actin like I don't know you


You can say I'm wrong
You think that's kinda freaky
I can't be trusted
I'm kinda sneaky
But no get your story right
He knocked on my door
So what should I say no for?
So If that's your boyfriend
If that's your boyfriend
If that's your boyfriend
He wasn't last night
So If that's your boyfriend
If that's your boyfriend
If that's your boyfriend
He wasn't last night


Boyfriend boyfriend yes I had your boyfriend
If that's your boyfriend if that's your boyfriend
If that's your boyfriend
He wasn't last night
