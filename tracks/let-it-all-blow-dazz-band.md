This one diamond in a rough
Big plans, I can't fuck it up
Mind track, fuck and run it up (Yeah)
Past, ain't no runnin' from (Too)
I'm too proud to admit it right now (Yeah)
Just hope when I see shit
Money and tree, that's a whole lot of green, no (Woo!)

I know that I spend so much time
All on these drugs and chicks
Tryna make them my wife (Ooh)
Gonna put my birthstone on your ring finger tonight
No matter who I'm with when it's you on my mind (Ooh)

I been green
I been (I been) green
Was he loving you, touching you,
Treatin' you right, the way I should (Ooh)
(I been, I been)
The way I should
I been (I been) green
(I been, I been, oh)
Green
(I been, I been)

Right (Right)
Although I tried, I just can't put it aside (No way, no way, for real)
How many times can I say, "I apologize?" (Oh)
Then I'm ridiculed and ignored (Mm, huh)
But no more, no more (No more)
Whoa

I know that I spend so much time (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
All on these drugs and chicks
Tryna make them my wife (Yeah, yeah, yeah, woo)
Gonna put my birthstone on your ring finger tonight (Yeah)
(Make it bounce, make it bounce)
No matter who I'm with when it's you on my mind (Yeah, ooh)
(Make it bounce, make it bounce)

I been (I been) green
I been (I been) green (Oh)
Was he lovin you, touching you,
Treatin' you right, the way I should (The way)
(I been, I been)
The way I should
I been (I been) green
(I been, I been, oh)
Green
(I been, I been)

I just wanna realign your chakras (Chakras)
Baby, I'ma make you feel it in your body (Body)
You know I'ma mess around and fuck you all up (All up)
Shit, you gon' fuck around and need a doctor (Doctor)
Don't tell nobody what we up to (Oh)
Keep this between you and me
I just wanna realign your chakras (Oh, we all green)

I been (I been) green (Oh)
I been (I been) green (Oh, we all green)
Was he lovin you, touching you,
Treatin' you right, the way I should (The way)

(Juvenile throw? the street by the derby)


About to throw these last few hunnids (Throw it), this your last chance (Chance)
You lookin' like a laptop, I need a lap dance (Dance)
That ass'll make a cab driver leave the cab stand (Stand)
Shit, I'm about to whip it on you like the Dazz Band (Band)
I'm lookin' at that pussy print, I call it cat scan (Scan)
These other bitches lookin' garbage like the trash can (Can)
Whilin' for it, I fuck up a hundred thousand for it
I throw some money in the air, then hit the dollar mode
Bottles on the table, you could drink a fountain (Drink a fountain)
You been smokin', now the drinkin', let's blow up a pound then (Blow a pound)
Got some out of town friends, bring them bitches down then
Say you was gon' tear down for me, tear down then (Tear it down)
I been stackin' all my money, shit look like a mountain (Ayy)
If you standin' in my circle, you ain't get surrounded
I don't fuck with stupid hoes, I let 'em do they clown dance (Bitch)
If you make it clap for me, bitch, I'm pullin' out bands (Shut the fuck up)


Fuckin' to some Chris Brown, king of R&B (B)
She want me to climb up in it like a tree (Tree)
Is that ass real or fake? I'ma find out (Out)
She say she like it rough, I'ma pull her tracks out (Yank it)
I might blow it all, baby, tell me what's the total? (I got you)
Ain't nothin' out my range, I get brain in the Rover (Gangsta)
You knew she was a diamond, should have kept her in the vault
Uncut, no soda, she want me to hit it raw
At the Bentley dealership, if she want it, she can have it
Gon' grab it baby, hashtag rich nigga challenge (Challenge)
Bust it wide open, baby, gon' bend it over (Over)
Fuck me like you hate me, girl, that pussy bipolar

Rock the boat, rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock-rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat


I been (I been) green
I been (I been) green
Was he lovin you, touching you,
Treatin' you right, the way I should (The way)
(I been, I been)
The way I should
I been (I been) green
(I been, I been, oh)
Green
(I been)
