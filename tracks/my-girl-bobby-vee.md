I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
And when it's cold outside
I've got the month of May

I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talking 'bout my girl, my girl

Hey, girl, I want you to know
I'm gonna miss you so much
If you go (please don't go)

Hey, girl, I tell you no lie
Something deep inside of me's
Going to die if you say so long

I've got so much honey
The bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song, baby
Than the birds in the trees

I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talking 'bout my girl, my girl

Hey, girl, now don't put me on
What's gonna happen when you've gone
How will I live, how can I go on
How can I go on

Hey, girl (my girl, my girl)
(What can make me feel this way)
How can I go on...
