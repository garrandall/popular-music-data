Da da da...

I'll make you mine, yes I will, just give me a little time
All of the words that I wanna say are hard to find

I'll make you mine, yes I will, just give me a little time
To let you know how I really feel and make you mine

I'm not the kind of guy who'll say a lot of fancy things that
Sweep you off your feet before you even know what's happening
But

I'll make you mine, yes I will, just give me a little time
All of the words that I wanna say are hard to find

Da da da...

I'm not the kind of guy who'll say a lot of fancy things that
Sweep you off your feet before you even know what's happening
But

I'll make you mine, yes I will, just give me a little time
To let you know how I really feel and make you mine

Da da da...

Just wait a little while, then I'll find a way to tell you
You're gonna be my girl, then I'm gonna build my world around you

I'll make you mine, yes I will, just give me a little time
All of the words that I wanna say are hard to find

Da da da...
