How can I unsay the things I said to you
How can I undo the things that we used to do
Tell me how can I unfeel the way I feel for you how can I unlove you
How can I untight the hold that you got on me
When you won't unchain my heart and set me free
How can I unremember every memory so how can I unlove you

I'll never never uncry tears that I cried when you said goodbye
No I'll never never unmiss the thrill that I missed when we used to kiss
How can I unsay the things I said to you
And how can I undo the things that we used to do
Tell me how can I unfeel the way I feel for you how can I unlove you
