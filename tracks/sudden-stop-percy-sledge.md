Walkin' out
Didn't talk it out
Now she's gone so you can't mark it out
I'm all alone and I must do without
All the love that I can't live without

Played along
Did her wrong
And I don't blame the girl for being gone
I was cheating on her all along
I can't really see her stayin' on

When a man is being loved
He takes it for granted
He can't see himself fallin'
He thinks he's on top
Oh, but it's not the fall
That hurts him at all
It's the sudden stop

Suddenly
She stopped loving me
Found me running 'round and set me free
Now my misery is my company
And I'm missing her touch constantly

(Walkin' out)
Oh, she's walking out
(Didn't talk it out)
(Now she's gone so we can't)
Don't wanna talk it out
Now she's gone so you can mark it out
All the love that I can't live without
(Walkin' out)
Oh, she's walkin' out
(Walkin' out)
(Now she's gone so you can mark it out)
