My baby lives in shades of blue
Blue eyes and jazz and attitude
He lives in California too
He drives a Chevy Malibu

And when he calls
He calls for me and not for you
He lives for love, he loves his drugs
He loves his baby too

But I can't fix him, can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about this strange weather

But you are invincible
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable

My baby lives in shades of cool
Cool heart, and hands and aptitude
He lives for love, for women, too
I'm one of many, Bonnies blue

And when he calls
He calls for me and not for you
He prays for love, he prays for peace
And maybe someone new

But I can't help him, can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather

'Cause you are invincible
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable

Your hot, hot weather in the summer
Hot, hot, neglectful lover
Hot, hot weather in the summer
High, neglectful lover
You're crumbling, sadly
You're sadly crumbling

You are invincible
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable
