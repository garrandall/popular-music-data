So I never really knew you
God I really tried to
Blindsided, addicted
Thought we could really do this
But really I was foolish
Hindsight it's obvious

Talking with my lawyer
She said where'd you find this guy
I said young people fall in love
With the wrong people sometimes

Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you're in love
When you're really just in pain
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end it's better for me
That's the moral of the story babe

It's funny how a memory
Turns into a bad dream
When running wild turns volatile
Remember how we painted our house
Just like my grandparents did
So romantic but we fought the whole time
Should have seen the signs yeah

Talking with my mother
She said where'd you find this guy
Said some people fall in love
With the wrong people sometimes

Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you're in love
When you're really just in pain
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end it's better for me
That's the moral of the story babe

They say it's better to have loved and lost
Than never to have loved at all
That could be a load of shit
But I just need to tell you all

Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you're in love
When you're really just engaged
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end it's better for me
That's the moral of the story

Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you're in love
When you're really just in pain
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end it's better for me
That's the moral of the story babe
