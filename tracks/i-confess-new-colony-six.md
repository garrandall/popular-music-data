I confess to have a willingness
And wanting for you
To have you here by me, here by me
And all my life through

You run around
You run around
Run around baby
Run around baby

Someday maybe we'll have a love
Someday you say you'll 
Someday you may be my girl
Hand in hand we walk 
Though the land we walk around the world

But right now
But right now
You run around
You run around

Run around baby
Run around baby

Someday maybe we'll have a love
You'll be with me
'Til eternity and be mine
Sent from above, will
Be my love 'til the end of time

But right now
But right now
You run around
You run around

Run around baby
Run around baby

Someday maybe
We'll have a love

I confess to have a willingness
And wanting for you
To have you here by me, here by me
And all my life through
