Oh no!

Baba bababa baba ba ba
Baba bababa baba baba

I can't stand still 'cos you've got me goin'
Baba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Your slacks are low and your hips are shown'
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
I take you girl as you're standing there
Your low cut slacks and your long black hair
Don't want you goin' round with no one else
Cause when I'm with you I can't control myself

Defense is down and you've got me shakin'
Baba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
You've got me so that my nerves are breakin'
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
If you knew me like I know you girl
Your knees would bend and your hair would curl
You make me move yeah like no one else
When I'm with you I can't control myself



I've got this feeling that's inside of me
It makes me think of how things used to be
It makes me feel allright
When I'm with you at night
And we love, and we love

Baba bababa baba ba ba
Baba bababa baba baba

You fill me so with this big temptation
Baba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
This kind of feeling could move a nation
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
And I'm okay when I'm here with you
I do the things that you want me to
But do these things for no one else
When I'm with you I can't control myself

Baba bababa baba ba ba
Baba bababa baba baba

I Can't control myself
Baba bababa baba baba
I Can't control myself
But when I've got this feeling that's inside of me

Ah...
