Baby, tell me are you serious
Hey, boy
You got me so delirious

Oh, uh

Why don't you stop playing games
Oh, boy
Do you think you'll ever change

Baby, I don't know what I should do
No, about you
You sure make me feel like loving you
Ha, you sure do
Come on, baby

(Are you serious)

Don't tell me
Your heart belongs to someone else
Baby
I just can't be killing myself

No, no
You got me going round and round
Honey
I can't seem to settle down

Baby, I don't know what I should do
No, about you
You sure make me feel like loving you
Ha, you sure do
Come on, baby

(Are you serious)

Talk, talk about serious
Talk, talk about serious

Breaking hearts was my claim to fame
And I don't know if I'm gonna change

But if I'm really gonna be your man
I gotta change my ways if I can

Talk, talk about serious
Talk, talk about serious

You and me right from the start
Everything was fine then I broke your heart

So I'm telling you now
Like I told you then
If we can't be lovers
Let's just be friends

Baby, I don't know what I should do
No, about you
You sure make me feel like loving you
Huh, you sure do
Come on, baby

(Are you serious)

Breaking hearts is my claim to fame
And I don't know if I'm gonna change

But if I'm really gonna be your man
I gotta change my ways if I can

Talk, talk about serious (Are you serious)
Talk, talk about serious

(Talk) You and me right from the start
(Talk about serious) Everything was fine then I broke your heart

(Talk) So I'm telling you now like I told you then
(Talk about serious) If we can't be lovers let's just be friends

Talk, talk about serious (Are you serious)
Talk, talk about serious
