Hallelujah day
Sing hallelujah
Love is on its way
It's coming to ya

Children gather 'round now
Clap your hands and sing
That old sun is shining down
Soon the bells are gonna ring
Yes they will now
Can't you see that ray of hope
Somebody finally saw the light
They're gonna send our brothers home
It's gonna be alright, yeah

Hallelujah day
Sing hallelujah
Love is on its way
It's coming to ya
Hallelujah day
Sing hallelujah
Love is on its way
It's coming to ya

People come together
Let the good times roll
We can make this last forever
If you feel it in your soul
Somebody found that key
Somebody opened up the door
Now there'll be dancing in the street
This is the day we've been waiting for, yeah

Hallelujah day
Sing it, yeah
Sing hallelujah
Hallelujah day
Sing hallelujah

Oh yeah
Everybody get together
Put your hands like this
And sing along with the Jackson Five, yeah
Singing hallelujah
Singing, singing, singing, yeah
Hallelujah, yeah
