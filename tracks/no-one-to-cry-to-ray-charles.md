(I need someone to say I do)
No one to cry to now, no one to say goodnight
No one to tell my troubles to

I've got no one, to sigh to, no one to hold me
Tight
No one to chear me when I'm blue

When I go home to my lonely room
And find there's no one there
And each night I think of you, so please answer this
One prayer

And you'll need someone, I said to cry to
Someone to say I do
Someone to whisper I love you

When I go home to my lonely room
And find there's no one there
And each night I think of you, so please answer this
One prayer

And you'll need someone, I said to cry to
Someone to say I do
Someone to whisper I love you
