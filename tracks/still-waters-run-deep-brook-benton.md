As we walk along and I hold her hand
I may never even speak
But my love is strong and she understands
Still waters run deep, still waters run deep
Like the mountain tall reaching for the sky
My love reaches silently
And my eyes disclose what my darling knows
Aww, still waters run deep, still waters run deep
She don't need to hear all those pretty words repeated endlessly
In her heart she knows I would die for her if it had to be
So we walk along and I hold her hand
Though we hardly even speak
I'm a lucky man 'cause she understands
Still waters run deep, still waters run deep
She don't need to hear all those pretty words repeated endlessly
In her heart she knows I'll die for her if it had to be
So we walk along and I hold her hand
Though we hardly even speak
I'm a lucky man 'cause she understands
And still waters run deep, still waters run deep
Still waters
