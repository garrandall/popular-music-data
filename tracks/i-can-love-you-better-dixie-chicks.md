She's got you wrapped up in her satin and lace
Tied around her little finger
She's got you thinkin' you can never escape
Don't you know your heart's in danger


There's a devil in that angel face
If you could only see the love that you're wasting


I can love you better than that
I know how to make you forget her
All I'm askin' is for one little chance
'Cause, baby, I can love you
Baby, I can love you better


I'm gonna break the spell she's got on you
You're gonna wake up to find
I'm your desire, my intentions are true
Hey, babe, I know in time


You're gonna see what you mean to me
So open up your eyes 'cause seein' is believin'


I can love you better than that
I know how to make you forget her
All I'm askin' is for one little chance
'Cause, baby, I can love you
Baby, I can love you better

Woah
Yeah, oh, yeah


I can love you better than that
I know how to make you forget her
All I'm askin' is for one little chance
'Cause, baby, I can love you
Baby, I can love you
I can love you better than that
I know how to make you forget her
All I'm askin' is for one little chance
'Cause, baby, I can love you
Baby, I can love you better

Woah
Yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, oh


I can love you better than that
I know how to make you forget her
All I'm askin' is for one little chance
'Cause, baby, I can love you
Baby, I can love you
I can love you better than that
I can love you better
I can love you better than that
Baby, I can love you
Baby, I can love you better
