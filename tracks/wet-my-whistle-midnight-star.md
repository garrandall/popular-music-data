Wet my whistle
Wet my whistle
Wet my whistle


Just like sweet wine baby
Your love's intoxicatin'
Why'd I had to taste it mmh
This is much too good to waste it
So baby let me love you
I'll place no one above you


Cause I'm hooked babe
On your love
Just because


I just had to wet my whistle
When I kissed your lips girl
I couldn't get enough
I had to wet my whistle
Just a little bit baby
Was much too much
Wet my whistle


First I was only playin'
Now look where love is layin'
So softly on my pillow (Little girl)
I'll never ever let you go (No, no, no)
Love was never on my mind
I thought I'd better take my time
But girl you drive me crazy
(You're such a real fine lady) You're so fine


And I'm hooked baby
On your love
Yes I'm hooked baby
I just can't get enough
Said I'm hooked baby
On your love
Just because


I just had to wet my whistle
When I kissed your lips girl
I couldn't get enough
I had to wet my whistle
Just a little bit baby
Was much too much
I had to wet my whistle
When I kissed your lips girl
I couldn't get enough
I had to wet my whistle
Just a little bit baby
Was much too much
Wet my whistle (Yeah, yeah)


(Just a little bit) Oh
(Just a little bit) Baby
(A little bit baby) Just a little bit
(Just a little bit) On your love
(Just a little bit) Baby
(A little bit baby) Whoa whoa
(Just a little bit) Baby
(Just a little bit) Baby
(A little bit baby) Whoa whoa
(Just a little bit) Oh baby
(Just a little bit) Oh baby yeah
(A little bit baby)


I just had to wet my whistle
When I kissed your lips girl
I couldn't get enough
I had to wet my whistle
Just a little bit baby
Was much too much too much
I had to wet my whistle
Oh when I kissed your lips baby
You know how to drive me crazy
Oh oh
Was much too much
I just had to wet my whistle
