Seems everyday
I'm gettin' harder pressed
To find a reason to shave
Watchin' the hours
Just slippin' away
No motivation to get out of bed
And carry on the charade
Caught in a dream that's goin' astray

Oh, all those great expectations
Seems they never work out, never work out
The way that I plan
All those great expectations
Why they never work out, never work out
I can't understand

And just when I think
That things are goin' right
I get a call from L.A.
Sorry to say "we're changin' your song"
I try to reason
But I can't get through
They're gonna do it their way
What can I say
They've never been wrong

Oh, all those great expectations
Seems they never work out, never work out
The way that I plan
All those great expectations
Why they never work out, never work out
I can't understand

Life is just a game of chance
I think somebody said so
Sometimes you get a hula hoop
Sometimes you get an Edsel

Oh, all those great expectations
Seems they never work out, never work out
The way that I plan
All those great expectations
Why they never work out, never work out
I can't understand
