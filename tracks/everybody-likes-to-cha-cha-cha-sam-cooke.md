Everybody loves to cha cha cha
Little children loves to cha cha cha
They like to cha cha cha 
They like to cha cha cha
Everybody loves to cha cha cha

I took my baby to the hop last night
And much to my surprise
When we got there she hit me with the news
Right between the eyes

Well, she said she could't do the cha cha cha
She said she couldn't do the cha cha cha
She couldn't cha cha cha 
She couldn't cha cha cha
My baby couldn't do the cha cha cha

I told her not to worry 
They'll play some other dance
But we sat there for an hour and a half
And we never got the chance

'Cause, every song they played was the cha cha cha
Every song that played was the cha cha cha
It was the cha cha cha 
It was the cha cha cha 
Every number was the cha cha cha

I told her not to worry
Theres only one thing we can do 
Baby if you'll let me take you by the hand
I'm going to teach this dance to you

And then I taught her one, two cha cha cha
Three, four cha cha cha
And up now cha cha cha 
Back now cha cha cha
Turn now cha cha cha 
Back now cha cha cha 
I taught my baby how to cha cha cha 

We kept on dancing 
And was I surprised, for you see
After we practiced for a little while 
She was doing it better than me

Now, my baby loves to do the cha cha cha
She loves to do the cha cha cha 
She loves to cha cha cha 
She loves to cha cha cha 
My baby loves to do the cha cha cha

Now here we go one, two cha cha cha 
Three, four cha cha cha...
