I can't believe that you're not here with me
To have a laugh or share a tear with me
It's all so wrong it can't be right
It must have been something I dreamed last night

To never see your funny face again
To never thrill to your embrace again
Oh, it's so wrong it can't be right
It must have been something I dreamed last night

Those midnight suppers for two
Our silly duets at dawn
Those crazy moments with you
Don't tell me that they are gone

To never look into those eyes again
The sun might just as well not rise again
Oh no, no, no, it can't be right
It must have been something I dreamed last night

I've set the table and a plate for you
Making believe you will soon be here
I watched the dawn sit and wait for you
It's impossible, hard as I try to convince myself
We've said goodbye

To never look into those eyes again
The sun might just as well not rise again
Oh no, no, no, it can't be right
It must have been something I dreamed last night
