Yeah
I'm home now, it's over now, shit
Yeah

She got a thing for Chanel vintage
That dropped before she could speak English
Do you love me or love seekin' attention
I mean which one is it?
You keep callin' me ya twin but twins ain't this different
Mentally I'm already on next year, that's some 2020 clear vision
You sayin' let you finish, I ain't tryin' hear it
I'm all for spiritual liftin' but I don't fly Spirit
I'm all for findin' happiness but down to die serious
All smiles, Kevin Durant trials
Had to blow it on the court I must of blew a mili'
I'm walkin' on all charges, that's my new Achilles
I know they love to rock a check but who gon' do it really? Really?
My depositions never surface
Tanenbaum know the logo on the jersey it's gettin' purchased
Ten years in and y'all yet to hear my most impressive verses
Paid the cost to be the boss wasn't even my most expensive purchase
Trust when I say I'm never on the shit they assumin' I'm on
Tales about me are like Kirito's and Kublai Khan's
Sashimi from Saito, you know that man two Michelin Star
Postcard from Grace Bay, sendin' my distant regards
Vision wasn't mine, told my niggas the vision was ours
Still a part of shawty even if we've been livin' apart
Rocks will do you filthily for me soon as I give him the nod
Meanin' he'll blast for me like puttin' the 6 with the God
Hop on a float to show the city the one they appointed
The one that's rebuilding schools and feedin' the homeless, hang with my niggas
But sometimes I be trying to avoid it
'Cause they'll get to poppin' out of place like they double jointed
Goals was the top of the pyramid in this shitty world
I got to get the most of everything is the axis on which it sit and twirls
Point blank period, like a city girl
And then I'll bring it back to fifty world

Aye, woah, you made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my face
Won't you let me know that I did okay?
Don't wait till some other day, no no
They love to wait till it's too late, too late

It's this one right here, yo (Aye)
I was nominated, never won a Grammy
But I understand they'll never understand me
Lotta lives lost but I never panicked
Lotta lines crossed I never did a Xanny
A hundred-room mansion but I felt abandoned
Love makin' love but where will love land me?
Jealous, so they bitches be actin' like they sleepin' on us
But they speakin' on us Zulus quote us even numbers
Still blowin' smoke as angels float above us
Love givin' back but will they ever love us?
Chanel in the mail, FedExin' for real
And what I got for sale just sit on the scale
Triple beam dream a buck on the shades
I really seen things give mothers the shakes
I really bought cars for woman on face
I know it seem odd but money amazin'
College loans really did fuck up her credit
Discover cards look back I know she regret it
While we keep pushin', keep our foot on the pedal
In the mirror she a blessin', rebukin' the devil
Livin' on the edge, she keepin' me level
Money come and go I'ma keep you forever
Money come and go I'ma keep you forever
Slip-on glass slippers and tickle with feathers
Everywhere we go we create a dilemma
Coming to America really to set
I'll let your Soul Glo, I'm keepin' you wet
All my cold Decembers I know she remembers
Forgiveness for a sinner but is it that simple?
Holdin' on your hands your body's a temple
Fly you out to Cannes, m√©nages with bitches
Lobsters and the praws, thought you was spinach
Bottles for the Don, our parties the biggest
(Maybach Music)

Aye, woah, you made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my face
Won't you let me know that I did okay?
Don't wait till some other day, no no
They love to wait till it's too late, too late (Aye)

Had a dream she was singin' to me like Gladys Knight
True love in the projects is called paradise
All your niggas left you wasn't actin' right
But honesty itself a small sacrifice
My moneybag heavy, got me packin' light
You movin' funny, can you fuel my appetite?
Niggas conversations a lot of it false
You own condos right over Carnegie Hall
Speak about your cars but all of them parked
You niggas money light, come out of the dark
You really are my type, this not a facade
One of the reasons why I write, we got a synopsis
I'm always at the top of barbershop gossip
After further thought, better not knock 'em
Allocate some dollars to go out shoppin'
Bitch, we on the real it's time to stop talkin'

Aye, woah, you made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my face
Won't you let me know that I did okay?
Don't wait till some other day, no no
They love to wait till it's too late, too late (Aye)
(Maybach Music)
