Ah-ah
Ah-ah


I came here tonight to get you out of my mind
I'm gonna take what I find (Uh-oh, yeah!)
So open the box, don't need no key, I'm unlocked
And I won't tell you to stop (Uh-oh, yeah!)


Hey boy! I don't need to know where you've been
All I need to know is you in, no need for talkin'
Hey boy! So don't even tell me your name
All I need to know is whose place
And let's get walkin'


All I wanna do is love your body
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
All I wanna do is love your body
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it


It's true what you heard, I am a freak, I'm disturbed
So come on and give me your worst (Uh-oh, yeah)
We're moving faster than slow
If you don't know where to go
I'll finish off on my own (Oh-oh, yeah)


Hey boy! I don't need to know where you've been
All I need to know is you in, no need for talkin'
Hey boy! So don't even tell me your name
All I need to know is whose place
And let's get walkin'
Say, say, hey


All I wanna do is love your body
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
All I wanna do is love your body (Your body)
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
Yeah, yeah


I think you already know my name
I think you already know my name
Hey, hey, ha! Alright, say
I think you already know my name


All I wanna do is love your body (Hey, hey, say)
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
All I wanna do is love your body (Say, say, hey)
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
