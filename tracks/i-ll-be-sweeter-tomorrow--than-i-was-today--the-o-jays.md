Do do do do...
I always like to be
On my P's and Q's
I don't want to miss something
Nice that I can do for you
I know you love me
The way I, ohh
But something inside of me
Keeps saying do more
Do more, do more if you can
I got news for you
Good news for, oh
I'm gonna be sweeter to you
Than I was yesterday
You call me your
Sugar and spice man
Your everything nice man
But I'm just trying to
Give you half as much
As you've given me
And I, I don't doubt myself
I know I'm doing my jo
But I believe I can squeeze
A little bit more love
Out of this old heart
I know you love me
The way I, ohh
But something inside of me
Keeps saying do more
Do more, do more if you can
I got news for you
Good news for, oh
I'm gonna be much sweeter
To you than I was yesterday
I got news for you
Good news for, oh
I'm gonna be sweeter to you
Than I was yesterday
