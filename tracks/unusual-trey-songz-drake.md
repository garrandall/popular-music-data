And I Wouldnât Be Me If I Didnât Get A Little Nasty

Na Na Na Na Na Na Na 



How `bout we just move over and do it where we at
How `bout you just lift that skirt up
Ohh... We can be bad

That place that ainât been touched, Iâm feeling on it
Iâll let you sit through, keep spinning on it
Girl... Giddy Up Giddy Up, take me on a ride to ecstasy

You donât wanna bump bump then take a nap
You just wanna bump bump bring right back
Watch me
Iâma heat it up, beat it up
Ohhh


I know youâre tired of the usual, usual, usual
I can give you more than the usual
Not your regular, Tell you what, Let me touch
You gonâ feel something unusual, unusual, unusual
Iâm not gonâ do what the usual,
Not your regular, Tell you what, Let me touch
You gonâ feel something unusual


I wanna do the wicked things you never do
What if we get it while your friends was in the room
Is that too hot for ya?
Donât you feel bad, Let em feel sexy
We can make a sex room wherever we go
Take it to the restroom, they ainât gotta know
No.. Ohh..
Watch me heat it up, Beat it up
Woo.. Hey!
Do You hear me girl?
Watch me heat it up, Beat it up
Woo


I know youâre tired of the usual, usual, usual
I can give you more than the usual
Not your regular, Tell you what, Let me touch
You gonâ feel something unusual, unusual, unusual
Iâm not gonâ do what the usual,
Not your regular, Tell you what, Let me touch
You gonâ feel something unusual


Restaurant (Check)
Cinema (Check)
On the hood (Check)
Of the car (Check)
On the top (Check)
On the beach


This that other shit
You know you ask for it
I might just save you some money, And getcha passport
So You can come to me city, Iâll take you all over
And Hit you on the balcony, Just donât fall over
Send me a picture baby, you know Iâd never leak it
I know you got something recent, For someone decent
Why you laughing out loud, Iâm serious
Bring your girl if you a little bi-curious
Please... Please No Storytelling to others
I promise you gonâ love it
I would never let you down
Feel like I might of perfected, All the things that youâve expected
And you gonâ know it when you bring your ass around
Motherfu... Oh!


I know youâre tired of the usual, usual, usual
I can give you more than the usual
Not your regular, Tell you what, Let me touch
You gonâ feel something unusual, unusual, unusual
Iâm not gonâ do what the usual,
Not your regular, Tell you what, Let me touch
You gonâ feel something unusual


Get it all different kind of ways
All different places
Look at the many love faces you making
But can you take it
Ohh
