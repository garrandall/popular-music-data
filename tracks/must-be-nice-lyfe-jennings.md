Ayo you
You that just flipped on this CD player
I just wanna inform you that
When you got somebody good

You hold on to em'
Mmm...
Must be nice
Having someone who understands

The life you live
Must be nice
Having someone who's slow to take
And quick to give

Must be nice
Having someone who sticks around
When the rough times get thick
Someone who's smile is bright enough

To make the projects feel like a mansion
Must be nice
Having someone who loves you
Despite your faults

Must be nice
Having someone who talks the talk
But also walks the walk
Must be nice

Having someone who understands
That a thug has feelings too
Someone who loves you for sho'

You just remember to never let 'em go
Even when your hustling days are gone
She'll be by your side still holding on
Even when those 20's stop spinning

And all those gold-digging women disappear
She'll still be here
Must be nice
Having someone you can come home to

From a long day of work
Must be nice
Having someone you don't have to show
They know exactly where it hurts

Must be nice
Having someone who trusts you
Despite what they've heard
Someone as mighty as a lion

But still as gentle as a bluebird
Must be nice
Having someone you don't have to tell
You don't want to be alone no, no
Must be nice
Having someone you can grow old with
Until God calls ya'll home
Must be nice
Having someone who understands
That a thug has feelings too
Someone who loves you for sho'
You never let 'em go
X3
Even when your hustling days are gone
She'll be by your side still holding on
Even when those 20's stop spinning
And all those gold-digging women disappear
She'll still be here
Well I guess the next part of the story is that
After all this lust and all this time
I finally found me ssombody for me
Somebody I can tell the way I feel about you
