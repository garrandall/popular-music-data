I say, baby, don't you cry
You know I'll soon discover
One day by and by
That you loved another
No matter what you say
I'm going to leave you right away
So now, baby, baby, don't you cry
Mmm, you know you can't deny
I did my best to please you
But you were so unkind
But still I try to need you
True love that was sincere
You didn't really care
So now, baby, baby, don't you cry
And I remember, sweetheart, that it was you not I
Who said that we must part, uh huh
And the time has come to say goodbye
So why do you cry, sweetheart


Hey, hey, baby, don't you cry
Because I'm interfering
You ought to be satisfied
You know I'm going to keep on caring


Why should you feel blue
I'll tell you, I'm going to be the one to lose
Baby, baby, don't you cry


Whoa, baby, don't you cry
Because of any hearing
You ought to be satisfied because
I'm going to keep on caring


Why should you feel blue
You know I'll be the one to lose
So now, baby, baby, don't you cry
