Sophisticated lady
Sophisticated lady
She's a different lady with a different style
She stands tall and steady like the Eiffel Tower
She is hip to politics but loves her jazz
She's got lots of rhythm, she's got lots of class
Everybody knows
How she got her name, yeah
Oh, ha, she wears knee length dresses with her high heel steppers
She's not no back stabber but she's sure a pleaser
She talks quiet and gentle, she acts very cool
She sticks close to her lover, she obey God's rules, woh
Sophisticated lady
Sophisticated lady, yeah
Sophisticated lady
Oh
Sophisticated lady
That's her name, that's her name
Sophisticated lady
Woh, woh
Everybody knows
How she got her name, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, woh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
She's the kind of person that you'd like to meet
'Cause she's always smiling and she's always neat
She can start a fire in the coldest man
She's a hip slick sister known throughout the land, oh
Sophisticated lady
That's her name
Sophisticated lady, yeah
Oh, well, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, hoo
That's her name
Sophisticated lady, lady, lady
Sophisticated lady, oh
Sophisticated lady, ah
Sophisticated lady
Ooh, ooh
Sophisticated lady
Sophisticated lady
Just sit on down
Sophisticated lady
