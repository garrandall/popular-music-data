Trapped at first glance
I did a double take
A victim without a chance
Pulled in by the bait

When I caught the fishnet
Black pantyhose
Big legs show through the holes

Fishnet
Black pantyhose
She’s out to catch you
With those fishnet pantyhose

Closer
I can’t see
These drawers I could not pass
She turned toward me
Things were moving kinda fast, kinda fast

When I saw those fishnet
Black pantyhose
Big legs show through the holes

Fishnet
Black pantyhose
She’s out to catch you
With those fishnet pantyhose

Fishnet
Black pantyhose
Show everything from
Her waist down to her toes

Fishnet
Black pantyhose
Now I’m the catch
Anything goes

You know
I always wondered
What it’d feel like to be hunted
Kinda makes you feel like a fish in the sea

But the way you’re looking
In those fishnets, mama
You could trap me

Fishnet
Black pantyhose
Fishnet
Black pantyhose

Fishnet
Big legs
Fishnet
Black pantyhose

Ah, this is gonna be serious
But I must remember
My own famous words

Look at this big-legged woman
Wondering what to do
You can do most anything
Just don’t lose your cool

Fishnet
Black pantyhose
Big legs show through the holes

Fishnet
Black pantyhose
Out to catch you
With those fishnet pantyhose

Fishnet
Black pantyhose
Big legs show through the holes

Fishnet
Black pantyhose
Now I’m the catch
Anything goes

Women, let your big legs show
Let me lose control
Every time I see you in your

Fishnet
Black pantyhose
Big legs show through the holes

Fishnet
Black pantyhose
She’s out to catch you
With those
Fishnet pantyhose

Fishnet
Black pantyhose
Big legs show through the holes

Fishnet
Black pantyhose
Now I’m the catch
Anything goes
(Fishnet)
