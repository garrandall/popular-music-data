Come with me
Stay the night
You say the words but boy it don't feel right
What do you expect me to say
(You know it's just too little too late)

You take my hand
And you say you've changed
But boy you know your begging don't fool me
Because to you it's just a game
(You know it's just too little too late)

So let me on now
'Cause time has made me strong
I'm starting to move on
I'm gonna say this now
Your chance has come and gone
And you know

It's just too little too late
A little too wrong
And I can't wait
But you know all the right things to say
(You know it's just too little too late)
You say you dream of my face
But you don't like me
You just like the chase
To be real it doesn't matter anyway
(You know it's just too little too late)

It's just too little too late

I was young and in love
I gave you everything
But it wasn't enough
And now you wanna communicate
(You know it's just too little too late)

Go find someone else
I'm letting you go
I'm loving myself
You got a problem
But don't come asking me for help
'Cause you know

It's just too little too late
A little too wrong
And I can't wait
But you know all the right things to say
(You know it's just too little too late)

You say you dream of my face
But you don't like me
You just like the chase
To be real it doesn't matter anyway
(You know it's just too little too late)

I can love with all of my heart, baby
I know I have so much to give
(I have so much to give)
With a player like you I don't have a prayer
That's no way to live, no, no

It's just too little too late

It's just too little too late
A little too wrong
And I can't wait
But you know all the right things to say
(You know it's just too little too late)

You say you dream of my face
But you don't like me
You just like the chase
To be real it doesn't matter anyway
(You know it's just too little too late)

You know it's just too little too late
I can't wait, no, no, no

It's just too little too late
A little too wrong
And I can't wait
But you know all the right things to say
(You know it's just too little too late)

You say you dream of my face
But you don't like me
You just like the chase
To be real it doesn't matter anyway
(You know it's just too little too late)
