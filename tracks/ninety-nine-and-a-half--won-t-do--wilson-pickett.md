I got to have all your love, night and day
Not just a little part, but all of your heart, sugar

Ninety-nine and a half just won't do
Oh, no, no, just won't get it

Don' t be led in the wrong direction
To start this thing off right, a man need a little love and affection
Yes he do, now

Ninety-nine and a half just won't do
Oh, no, no, just won't get it

All right. Lookie here

We got to bring it all down, start gettin' it right
We got to stop this messin' around, and keep the thing up tight
Yes we do, now

Ninety-nine and a half just won't do
Oh, no, no, just won't get it

All right, sugar
Got to have a hundred
Got to have a hundred
All right
Ooh, I must do, I must do
I must do now

Oh! Got to have a hundred
Got to have a hundred
Oh! Got to have a hu-hu-hu-hu-hu-hundred, too right
Got to have a hundred, now. Oh
