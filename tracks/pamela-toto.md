Side by side
I'll be yours forever
Yes I will
Rain or shine
Any kind of weather
Any kind

There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
Let's take what's getting old and make it new

Eye to eye
It's a blinding confrontation
I said you and I
are a deadly combination

So don't start mixing truth with jealousy
The road we're on is clear as far as I can see

Pamela
Don't break this heart of mine
Just remember it may not heal this time
Pamela
There is no second chance
For the one who leaves it all behind

Black and white
Always go together
And on day and night
You're the precious jewel I treasure

Wanting every part of you is not a crime
Could it be that you're the one who's wrong this time

Pamela
Don't break this heart of mine
Just remember it may not heal this time
Pamela
There is no second second chance
For the one who leaves it all behind
Leave all

Oh Pamela
Thousands of miles away but always in my heart

Pamela
So don't break this heart of mine
Just remember it may not heal this time
Pamela
There is no second chance
For the one who leaves it all behind

Pamela
Don't break this heart of mine
Just remember it may not heal this time
Pamela
There is no second chance
For the one who leaves it all
Leave all beind

I still love you little girl
I still love you
And you know it little Pamela
I still love you yes I do
And you know it little Pamela
Come on
Oh little Pamela
