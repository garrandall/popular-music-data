Bill walked me to my door last night
And he said, Before I go....
There's something about our love affair
That I have a right to know......
I said, Lets not stand out here like this
What would the neighbors think?
Why don't we just step inside
And Ill fix us both a drink

My girl Bill
My, my, girl Bill
Can't say enough about the way I feel
About my girl..... my girl Bill

Williams hands were shaking
As he took his glass of wine
And I could see we both felt the same
And when his eyes met mine
I said, Who we love and why we love
Its hard to understand
Lets just sit here on the couch
And face this, man to man

My girl Bill
My, my, girl Bill
Can't say enough about the way I feel
About my girl..... my girl Bill

Bill, you know we just left her place
And we both know what she said
She doesn't want to see your face
And she wishes you were dead!
Now, I know we both love her
And I guess we always will
But you're gonna have to find another
Cause shes my girl ........ Bill!

My girl Bill
My, my, girl Bill
Can't say enough about the way I feel
About my girl..... talkin' bout my little girl
My girl, Bill
