The sound of your footsteps
Telling me that you're near
Your soft gentle motion, baby
Brings out the need in me that no one can hear, except

In my midnight confessions
When I tell all the world that I love you
In my midnight confessions
When I say all the things that I want to
I love you

But a little gold ring you wear on your hand makes me understand
There's another before me, you'll never be mine
I'm wasting my time

Staggering through the daytime
Your image on my mind
Passing so close beside you, baby
Sometimes the feelings are so hard to hide, but

In my midnight confessions
When I tell all the world that I love you
In my midnight confessions
When I say all the things that I want to
I love you

That's a little gold ring you wear on your hand that makes me understand
There's another before me, you'll never be mine
I'm wasting my time

In my midnight confessions
When I'm telling the world that I love you
In my midnight confessions
When I say all the things that I want to
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
