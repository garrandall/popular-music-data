It was 9-29,9-29 back street big city.
The sun was going' down,there was music all around
It felt so right.

It was one of those nights,one of those nights when
you feel the world stop turnin',you were standing
There,there was music in the air.I should have been
Away,but I knew I'd have to stay.


Last train to London,just headin' out,
Last train to London,just leavin' town.
But I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you.
Let the music play on down the line tonight.

It was one of those nights,one of those nights when
You feel the fire is burnin',everybody was there,
Everybody to share,it felt so right.

There you were on your own,lookin' like you were
The only one around,I had to be with you,
Nothin' else that I could do,
I should have been away,but I knew I'd have to say.



Underneath a starry sky,time was still but hours
Must really have rushed by,I didn't realize
But love was in your eyes I really should have
Gone,but love went on and on...
