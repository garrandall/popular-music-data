Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waiting for a train
When I was feeling nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained
And rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
I was playing soft while Bobby sung the blues, yeah
Windshield wipers slapping time I was holding Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew


Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing, I mean nothing, honey if it isn't free, no no
Yeah feeling good was easy Lord, when he sang the blues
You know feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee


From the Kentucky coal mines to the California sun
Yeah, Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
Yeah, Bobby baby kept me from the cold
One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away
He's lookin' for that home, and I hope he finds it
But I'd trade all of my tomorrows for one single yesterday
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine


Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing, and that's all that Bobby left me
Feeling good was easy Lord, when he sang the blues
You know feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee


La da la la la, la da la la la da la
La da da la la la Bobby McGee yeah

La da la la la, la da la la la da la
La da da la la la Bobby McGee yeah

La da la la la, la da la la la da la
La da da la la la Bobby McGee yeah

La da la la la, la da la la la da la
La da da la la la Bobby McGee yeah


Lord, I called him my lover, I called him my man
I said called him my lover just the best I can and come on
And and a Bobby oh, and a Bobby McGee yeah
Lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo
Hey hey hey Bobby McGee, lord
La da la la la, la da la la la la la
Hey hey hey, Bobby McGee yeah
