Listen, baby
Ain't no mountain high
Ain't no valley low
Ain't no river wide enough, baby


If you need me, call me
No matter where you are
No matter how far (Don't worry, baby)
Just call my name
I'll be there in a hurry
You don't have to worry
Cause baby there


Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, babe


Remember the day
I set you free
I told you you could always count on me, darling
From that day on, I made a vow
I'll be there when you want me
Someway, somehow
Oh baby there


Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, babe


Oh no, darling


No wind, no rain
Nor winter storm
Can't stop me, baby


No, no baby


Cause you are my goal


If you're ever in trouble
I'll be there on the double
Just send for me


Oh, baby!


My love is alive
Way down in my heart
Although we are miles apart


If you ever need a helping hand
I'll be there on the double
Just as fast as I can


Don't you know that there...
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, baby
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
