This will be an everlasting love
This will be the one I've waited for
This will be the first time anyone has loved me

I'm so glad you found me in time
And I'm so glad that you rectified my mind
This will be an everlasting love for me

Loving you is some kind of wonderful
Because you showed me just how much you care
You've given me the thrill of a lifetime
And made me believe you've got more thrills to spare, oh

This will be an everlasting love
Oh, yes it will now

You brought a lot of a sunshine into my life
You filled me with happiness I never knew
You gave me more joy than I ever dreamed of
And no one, no one can take the place of you

This will be
You and me
Yes sir-ee
Eternally
Hugging and squeezing and kissing and pleasing together forever through ever whatever
Yeah yeah yeah yeah you and me
So long as I'm living true love I'll be giving to you I'll be serving 'cause you're so deserving
Hey, you're so deserving, you're so deserving
Yeah yeah yeah whoah
Love love love
Love love love
Love love love
Love love love
Love love love
Love love love
From now on
From now on
From now on
...
