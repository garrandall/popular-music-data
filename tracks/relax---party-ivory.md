Baby, baby, just stay, relax and party
Never take it there, never take it there

Baby when you're in a mood for a good time
All I need is a little of your time
We'll get together and hang out
No doubt, no, no

I'm feeling your fine and it's right
So let's go to the back of the club and unwind
Can't you feel me, can't you feel me

Baby, baby, just stay, relax and party
Let me take you there
Let me take you there
Let me take you there

And I like, the way that you move is so smooth
And there's someone there to feel you groove
You know that it's all good, baby

Girl until it stops the way you throw your hands in the air
There's always a fight
We can party all night long
Cause baby, baby, just stay, relax and party

Oh, let me take you there
Ohhh-woah
So, baby, baby, won't you stay, relax and party
Let me take you there
Let me take you there
Let me take you there
