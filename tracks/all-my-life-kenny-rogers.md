Are you sure I
Haven't loved you somewhere before
In another time, another place
On some distant shore?

You know me so well
Better than I know myself

And you loved me tonight (tonight)
Like you loved me all my life
All my life

And with the touch of your hand
You took me farther than I've never been
You love me like
You've loved me all my life

Love like we made
Could have taken a lifetime to find
But you found the way
To my heart in a moment of time

You know how to care
Just like you've always been there
(Just like you've always been there)
Just like you've always been there

And you loved me tonight (tonight)
Like you loved me all my life
All my life

And with the touch of your hand
You took me farther than I've never been
You love me like
You've loved me all my life

With the touch of your hand
You took me farther than I've never been
You love me like
You've loved me all my life

You love me like
You've loved me all my life
