She said, "I've seen you in here before."
I said, "I've been here a time or two."
She said, "Hello, my name is Bobby Jo.
Meet my twin sister Betty Lou.

And we're both feeling kinda wild tonight.
You're the only cowboy in this place.
And if you're up for a rodeo,
I'll put a big Texas smile on your face."
I said, "Girls,

I ain't as good as I once was
I got a few years on me now
But there was a time
Back in my prime
When I could really lay it down.

And if you need some love tonight
Then I might have just enough.
I ain't as good as I once was,
But I'm as good once as I ever was."

I still hang out with my best friend Dave.
I've known him since we were kids at school.
Last night he had a few shots,
Got in a tight spot
Hustlin' a game of pool
With a couple of redneck boys.
One great big bad biker man.
I heard David yell across the room,
"Hey, buddy, how 'bout a helping hand!"
I said, "Dave,

I ain't as good as I once was.
My, how the years have flown,
But there was a time
Back in my prime
When I could really hold my own.

But if you wanna fight tonight,
Guess those boys don't look all that tough.
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was."

I used to be hell on wheels
Back when I was a younger man.
Now my body says, "You can't do this, boy,"
But my pride says, "Oh, yes you can."

I ain't as good as I once was.
That's just the cold hard truth.
I still throw a few back,
Talk a little smack
When I'm feeling bullet-proof.

So don't double-dog dare me now
'Cause I'd have to call your bluff.
I ain't as good as I once was,
But I'm as good once as I ever was.
May not be good as I once was,
But I'm as good once as I ever was.
