Hey, Bill Bailey, Don't look now but somebody's callin' you
Who? Why, your lady friend, that's who
If I were you, if I were you, I'd get my little old self home
Won't you come home, Bill Bailey
Won't you come home?
She moans the whole day long
I'll do the cookin', honey, I'll pay the rent
I know, I done you wrong
Do you remember that rainy evenin'
I drove you out with nothin' but a fine tooth comb, yeah
I know I'm to blame, ain't it a shame
Bailey, won't you please come home
Ah, walk on home, Bill
Ah, like it, like that
Hey, Bailey, Let's go on home one more time here
Won't you come home Bill Bailey
Won't you come home?
She moans the whole day long
I'll do the cookin' honey, I'll even pay the rent
I know, I know, I done you wrong
Do you remember that rainy evenin', ah
That I drove you out, with nothin' but a fine tooth comb
And you are bald
I know I'm to blame, well ain't it a shame
Bailey, won't you please come
Bailey, won't you please come
Bailey, won't you please come
Bailey, won't you please come
Bailey, won't you please come
C'mon, Bailey, won't you please come
Go, Bailey, won't you please come
Bailey, won't you please come
Bailey, won't you please come
One more time
Oh, Bailey won't you please come home
Get on home
