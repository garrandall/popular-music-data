Softly whispering I love you
Echoes of your voice are calling
Still through my dreams
Softening the chill of the breeze
Through my window
I can see the moonglow
Painting silver shadows
On a rose-colored land

A world that we
Walk hand in hand
In a day of gold colored
By the glow of new love

Oh, woman
I can feel your warm face
Ever close to my lips
And the scent of you
Invades the cool evening air

I can close my eyes and
You're there in my arms still
And I know your soft kiss
Turning into music

Every beat of my heart
When I hold you close to my heart
And I hear your voice
Whispering I love you

I can feel your warm face
Ever close to my lips
And the scent of you
Invades the cool evening air

I can close my eyes
And you're there
There in my arms still
And I know your soft kiss
Kiss, turning into music

Every little beat of my heart
When I hold you close to my heart
I hear your voice, I love you

I can feel your warm face
Ever close to my lips
And the scent of you
Invades my every cell

I close my eyes
And you're there
Waiting in my arms, baby
And I know your soft kiss
Kiss, turning into music

Every beat of my heart, oh, yeah
When I hold you close to my heart
I hear your voice
Whispering I love you
