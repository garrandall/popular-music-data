Sitting in my class
Just drifting away
Staring into the windows of the world
Yeah
I can't hear the teacher
His books don't call me at all
I don't see the bad boys trying to catch some play


'Cause I love your smile
I love your smile


The clock at work says three
And I wanna be free
Free to scream, free to bathe
Free to paint my toes all day, woo!
My boss is lame you know
And so is the pay
I'm gonna put that new black mini on my charge anyway


'Cause I love your smile
Hey, said I love your smile


Time came and showed me your direction
Now I know I'll never ever go back
Taught me that
I can be a better girl
With the love you give
You rock my world
You dig?


I'm showin' the life that I'm living
This is the life that I have and it's given to you
Yeah and it's true
La-dee-da
Twinkly dee
Do you, believe in a girl like me?
Shanice is the one for you to be with
But when I'm caught all alone
I start fessing
It's from a state of depression
And the thunder clouds of doubt move in
I begin to wonder
"Do you still love me?"
But after that
My whole world is beautiful




Blow, Branford, blow


Time came and showed me your direction
Now I know I'll never ever go back
Taught me that
I can be a better girl
With the love you give
You rock my world
Smile, sike


Ooh, I love your smile (smile for me)
Yes I do boy, hee
I love your smile
I love your smile, baby


Heee, heee, heeee, heeeee
I love your smile
I really do (hahahahahaha)
