Well, I'm so tired of crying but I'm out on the road again
I'm on the road again
Well, I'm so tired of crying but I'm out on the road again
I'm on the road again

I ain't got no woman just to call my special friend

You know the first time I traveled out in the rain and snow
In the rain and snow
You know the first time I traveled out in the rain and snow
In the rain and snow

I didn't have no payroll, not even no place to go

And my dear mother left me when I was quite young
When I was quite young
And my dear mother left me when I was quite young
When I was quite young (When I was quite young)

She said: "Lord, have mercy on my wicked son"

Take a hint from me, mama, please, don't you cry no more
Don't you cry no more
Take a hint from me, mama, please, don't you cry no more
Don't you cry no more

Cause it's soon one morning down the road I'm going

But I ain't going down that long old lonesome road
All by myself
But I ain't going down that long old lonesome road
All by myself

I can't carry you, baby, gonna carry somebody else
