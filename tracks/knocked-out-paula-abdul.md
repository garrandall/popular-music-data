I was in love the moment that I saw you
I followed you through the crowd
And I almost lost you

I was dying to tell you but scared of your reaction
But I can't hold back
Because I'm rushed with thing called "passion"

You've got me knocked out
Turn me inside out
It's you that makes my heart beat
You've got me knocked out
Baby, there's no doubt
You swept me off of my feet

I walked your way hoping that maybe you noticed
(â Hi.)
(â Hello there.)
I don't wanna move so fast
I don't wanna blow it

Never did I think love could be so amazing
But the things that you're making me do
It's driving me crazy

You've got me knocked out
Turn me inside out
It's you that makes my heart beat
You've got me knocked out
Baby, there's no doubt
You swept me off of my feet

You've got me knocked out
Turn me inside out
It's you that makes my heart beat
You've got me knocked out
Baby, there's no doubt
You swept me off of my feet

I want us to be closer, boy
I wanna be startin' something with you, baby
My heart is steady knocking,
Boy, you've got my body rockin',
Caught blow-by-blow,
Love T.K.O.

You've got me knocked out
(I'm not down.)
Turn me inside out
It's you that makes my heart beat
You've got me knocked out
(I'm not down.)
Baby, there's no doubt
You swept me off of my feet

You've got me knocked out
Turn me inside out
It's you that makes my heart beat
You've got me knocked out
Baby, there's no doubt
You swept me off of my feet

You've got me knocked out
(I'm not down.)
Turn me inside out
It's you that makes my heart beat
You've got me knocked out
(I'm not down.)
Baby, there's no doubt
You swept me off of my feet
