Da da da da
Ooh, I've had sleepless nights
Toss and turn
Wake up burning for you to inspire

So I'm gonna walk right down your street
With a love that I can't hide
I've got one thing on my mind, yeah
I'll even sacrifice my pride
'Cause I want you

Oh, oh, how I wish you would be mine
My pulse is weak
I'm blushing brighter than a valentine

So I'm gonna walk right down your street
With a love that I can't hide
I've got one thing on my mind, yeah
I'll even sacrifice my pride

'Cause I can't stop the way I feel
So I keep walking, ohh
'Cause I want you

Walking down, down your street
I'm walking down your street
Walking down your street
Down your street, ohhh

I can't stop the way I feel
So I keep walking, ohh

Walking down your street
With a love that I can't hide
I've got one thing on my mind, yeah
I'll even sacrifice my pride

Walking down your street
With a love that I can't hide
I've got one thing on my mind, yeah
I'll even sacrifice my pride

Walking down your street
With a love that I can't hide
I've got one thing on my mind, yeah
I'll even sacrifice my pride
