On Lover's Island
Where the trees stand so tall
And the dust turn to gold
And love never grows old

On Lover's Island
Where the birds sing of love
Seems a gift from up above
I met her one day
(Met her one day)

As we stood alone on the mountain
Under the moon and stars above
Oh, darling, don't ever go
She was Venus, the goddess of love

On Lover's Island
Where the trees stand so tall
And the dust turn to gold
And love never, never
Never, never grows old
