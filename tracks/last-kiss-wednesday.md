Well, where oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road, straight ahead...
The car was stalled, the engine was dead

I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
Never forget the sound that night...
The cryin' tires, the bustin' glass
The painful scream that I heard last

Well, where oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

Well, when I woke up, the rain was pourin' down
There were people standing all around
Something warm running in my eyes
But I found my baby somehow that night

I raised her head, and when she smiled, and said
"Hold me darling for a little while."
I held her close. I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I would miss
But now she's gone, even though I hold her tight
I lost my love... my life, that night

Well, where oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world
