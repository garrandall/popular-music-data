When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it's hard
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you know it's hard
Everybody wants her, everybody loves her
Everybody wants to take your baby home
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch your friends

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it never ends
You know that it's crazy, you wanna trust her
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone
Maybe it's just an ego problem
Problem is that I've been fooled before

By fair-weather friends and faint hearted lovers
And every time it happens it just convinces me more
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you look for lies

Everybody tempts her, everybody tells her
She's the most beautiful woman they know
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch your friends
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it never ends
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes
