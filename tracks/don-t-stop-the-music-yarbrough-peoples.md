Don't you stop it, don't you stop
Don't stop the music
Don't you stop it, don't you stop
Don't stop the music

Don't you know you've got me mesmerized
With the beat I always fantasize
Don't stop the music cause it tends to soothe
I can tell you want to groove

Don't you stop it, don't you stop
Don't stop the music
Don't you stop it
(The beat keeps going round and round)
Don't you stop
(Turns me upside down)
Don't stop the music

I just wanna rock you (Oh, baby)
All night long (To my love song)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I just wanna rock (I just wanna rock you)
All night long (yeah)
I've got a love song (Whoa, whoa, whoa...)

Everything we do is right on time
The beat's so smooth, it blows my mind
Don't stop the music, it's so satisfying
It feels so good to me, there is no denying
Just because it's two o'clock, don't stop the music
Don't you feel like dancing and prancing
Don't stop the music

Don't you stop it, don't you stop
Don't stop the music
You don't really wanna stop, no
You don't really wanna stop, uh uh
You don't really wanna stop, no
You don't really wanna stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop

You've got me moving
You've got me grooving
Don't stop the music

Don't you feel like dancing
I can tell you wanna dance
Don't you feel like dancing
You've got me moving
You've got me grooving
Don't stop the music, yeah

Don't you stop it, don't you stop
Don't stop the music

(I just wanna rock you)
I just wanna rock you
(All night long)
All night long
(I just wanna rock you)
I just wanna rock you
(All night long)
All night long
(Love song, love song)
(Love song, love song)
I can tell you wanna boogie
I can tell you wanna boogie
I can tell you wanna boogie
I can tell you wanna boogie
(Boogie)

Don't you stop it
(You don't really wanna stop, no)
Don't you stop, don't stop the music
(You don't really wanna stop, uh huh)
Don't you stop it
(You don't really wanna stop, no)
Don't you stop, don't stop the music
(You don't really wanna stop, uh huh)

Just because it's two o'clock
Don't mean that we have to stop
(Don't stop)
Just because it's two o'clock
Don't mean that we have to stop
(Don't stop)
Just because it's two o'clock
Don't mean that we have to stop
(Don't stop)
Just because it's two o'clock
Don't mean that we have to stop
(Don't stop)
Boogie with me all night long

Don't you stop it, don't stop the music
Don't stop the music
Don't you stopit, don't stop the music
Don't stop the music
Don't you stop it, don't stop the music
Don't stop the music
Don't you stop it, don't stop the music
Don't stop the music
