I walk along the city streets
You used to walk with me
And every step I take recalls
How much in love, we used to be

Oh, how can I forget you
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me

I was born to love you, and I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me

When shadows fall, I pass a small cafe
Where we would dance at night
And I can't help recalling how it
Felt to kiss and hold you tight

Oh, how can I forget you
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me

I was born to love you, and I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me

If you should find you miss the sweet
And tender love we used to share
Just go back to the places where we used to go
And I'll be there

Oh, how can I forget you
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me

I was born to love you, and I will never be free
When there is, when there is
When there is always something there to remind me
