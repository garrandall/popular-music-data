Wrong side of town on the second floor
Couple blocks down from the liquor store
I got a love seat and a couple DVD's we can watch... or not
I can call a car, it will be two minutes
'Til it's at the bar and we hop in it
It's pretty clear that we're both here to get over someone

So if you wanna come over, come on
If you need a shoulder, it's on
I know you got your past and baby I got mine

But every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
Maybe that starts with me and you
We got all night
To get to know each other better
And try moving on together, together
I could kill the pain that you've been in
You can be my heartbreak medicine
Proof that even dark clouds have a silver lining
Every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
I wanna start something with you

There's a reason that we're both here right now
And a reason everything didn't work out
We're two sets of previous relationships at the same time

Every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
Maybe that starts with me and you
We got all night
To get to know each other better
And try moving on together, together
I could kill the pain that you've been in
You can be my heartbreak medicine
Proof that even dark clouds have a silver lining
Every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
I wanna start something with you

Baby come over, come on
If you need a shoulder, it's on
I know you got your past and I got mine

But every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
Maybe that starts with me and you
We got all night
To get to know each other better
And try moving on together

Baby come over, come on
If you need a shoulder, it's on
I know you got your past and I got mine
But every goodbye
