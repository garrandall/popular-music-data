It's your life, you say you need a change
Don't all the dreams we've seen come true mean anything
You say it's different now and you keep starin' at the door
How can you walk away, don't I matter anymore


If bein' free's worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye time


If we had known our love would come to this
We could have saved our hearts the hurt of wasted years
Well it's been fun, what else can I say
If the feeling's gone words won't stop you anyway


If bein' free's worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye time


Goodbye, Baby
