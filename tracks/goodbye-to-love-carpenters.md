I'll say goodbye to love
No one ever cared if I should live or die
Time and time again the chance for love
Has passed me by and all I know of love
Is how to live without it I just can't seem to find it

So I've made my mind up I must live my life alone
And though it's not the easy way
I guess I've always known I'd say goodbye to love

There are no tomorrows for this heart of mine
Surely time will lose these bitter memories
And I'll find that there is someone to believe in
And to live for something I could live for

All the years of useless search have finally reached the end
Loneliness and empty days will be my only friend
From this day love is forgotten I'll go on as best I can

What lies in the future is a mystery to us all
No one can predict the wheel of fortune as it falls
There may come a time when I will see that I've been wrong
But for now this is my song and it's goodbye to love
I'll say goodbye to love
