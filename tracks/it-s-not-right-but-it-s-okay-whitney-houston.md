Friday night
You and your boys went out to eat
Then they hung out
But you came home around three
Now if six of ya'll went out
Then four of you were really cheap
'cause only two of you had dinner
I found your credit card receipt

It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me

It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you, leave your keys
I'd rather be alone than unhappy

I'm packing bags so you can leave town for a week, yes I am
The phone rings then you look at me
Why'd you turn and look at me?
You said it was one of your friends
Down on 54th street
So why did 213 show up on your caller ID?

I've been through all this before
Don't think about it, don't think about it
Get gone, get gone
Things are gonna change, baby
You don't stand a chance, boy
You don't stand a chance
Don't you turn around
There's no more tears left here for you to see

Was it really worth you going out like that?
See, I'm moving on
And I refuse to turn back
See, all of this time
I thought I had somebody down for with me
It turns out
You were making a fool of me

It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me

It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you, leave your keys
I'd rather be alone than unhappy
