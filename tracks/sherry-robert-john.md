Sheeeeery baby
Sherry, can you come out tonight
You better ask your mama
Tell her everything is all right

(Why don't you come out)
To my dance party (come out)
Where the bad moon shines (come out)
We're gonna dance the night away
I'm gonna make you mine

Sheeeeery baby
Sherry, can you come out tonight

(Why don't you come out)
With your red dress on (come out)
Girl, you look so fine (come out)
Move it nice and easy
I'm gonna make you mine

Sheeeeery baby
Sherry, can you come out tonight
You better write your mama
Tell her everything is all right

Ah (Sherry baby) Sherry baby
Ah (Sherry baby) Sherry baby
Ah (Sherry baby) Sherry baby...
