I don't think that man should sleep alone
I don't think it's fair
Do you, baby?
I don't think that man should sleep alone
Somebody should be there

This world that we live in
Has too many laws and too many rules
The thought of you and me sleeping here
Seems like everybody disapproves

Now I'm not I'm not saying
That I'm right and everyone else is wrong
I admit I've got a problem
I can't stand sleeping alone

I don't think that man should sleep alone
I don't think it's fair
Do you, baby?

I can't seem to get warm enough
Even with four blankets and a sheet
I may as well be honest, girl
I think I need a little body heat

Wake up
Wake up, baby
Yes, I know it's a quarter to 3:00 a.m
But either you're coming here
Or I'm coming there
'Cause I just can't get to sleep

I don't think that man should sleep alone
I don't think it's fair
Do you, baby

Baby, come on
I want to feel you lying next to me
Don't you, baby?

Sugar, come on
Rock this baby to sleep

Come on come on
Let's hold each other real good
Come on come on
I won't try nothing baby

Come on
Come on
But honey it could feel good
If you'll only let loose
Come on

I don't think that man should sleep alone
I don't think it's fair
Do you, baby?

Help me, baby
Baby, come on
I need body heat
Don't you, baby?

Sugar
Come on, girl
I want to feel your
Baby come on
Rock, rock me to sleep

Sugar
Come on, girl
I want to feel your heat
