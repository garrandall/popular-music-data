Girl, if ever the going got rough
You never
Were the type to think of backing down
So when you got more than your share
In a minute, I knew your heart was in it
I knew that it would make you be your best
Put you to the test
But if sometimes it seems not worth the battle
That's when you'll see
You can count on me


'Cause I'm with you all the way
I'll never give up this dream
Although it may seem
There's no way out today (Oh, girl)
Yes, I'm with you all the way
Whatever places love might put us through
Remember I'm with you
With you all the way


When you see me
Your eyes say that you need me
But there's another feeling they can't hide
And it hurts so deep inside
To think maybe before I'd let you down
Won't you hear me out now
Believe me somehow


'Cause I'm with you all the way
I'll never give up the dream
Although it may seem
There's no way out today (Oh, girl)
Yes, I'm with you all the way
Whatever places love might put us through
Remember I'm with you
With you all the way


I thought I'd never know just where to start
Delivering this promise from my heart
Holding you here in my arms
Has told me what to say, yeah


'Cause I'm with you all the way
I'll never give up the dream
Although it may seem
There's no way out today (Oh, girl)
Yes, I'm with you all the way
Whatever places love might put us through
Remember I'm with you
With you all the way
