Alone and far away from home
A boy stands in a foreign land

Lonely is he and in the dark
He wipes away a tear
As he thinks to himself
Does anybody know I'm here

He's got a girl
Far on a distant shore
And he wonders
If she loves him anymore

Cold, so cold is the wind
And in the dark
He wipes away a tear
As he thinks to himself
Does anybody know I'm here

And then a voice says
Don't worry bout it, baby
I'll be right here
Don't worry bout it, baby
I'll be right here

(But he keeps on saying, baby)
Don't worry bout it baby
(Don't let me lose your love)
I'll be right here (oh, oh, baby)

Don't worry bout it, baby
(Don't let me lose your loving)
I'll be right here

Cold, oh, so cold is the wind
And in the dark
He wipes away a tear
Oh, as he thinks to himself
Does anybody know I'm here

(But he keeps on saying, baby)
Don't worry bout it baby
(Don't let me lose your love)
I'll be right here (oh, oh, baby)

Don't worry bout it, baby
(Don't let me lose your loving)
I'll be right here
