Help the poor
Won't you help poor me
I need help from you baby
Need it desperately
I need you so much
I need your care
Need all the loving baby you can spare
Help the poor
Oh, baby won't you help poor me

Say you will
Say you'll help me on
I can't make it no longer
In this world alone
Baby I'm beggin' with tears in my eyes
For your love don't you realize
I need help 
Oh baby help poor me

You are my inspiration
Baby that's makes be a king
But if you don't come to my rescue
I couldn't ever be anything

Help the poor
Won't you help poor me
Have a heart won't you baby
Listen to my plead
Oh I lost my courage till I found you
You got what it takes baby
To pull me through
Help the poor
Oh baby won't you help poor me

You are my inspiration
Baby that's makes be a king
But if you don't come to my rescue
I couldn't ever be anything

Help the poor
Won't you help poor me
Have a heart won't you baby
Listen to my plead
Oh I lost my courage till I found you
You got what it takes baby
To pull me through
Help the poor
Oh baby won't you help poor me
