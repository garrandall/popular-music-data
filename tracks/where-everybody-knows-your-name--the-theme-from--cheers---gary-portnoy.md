Making your way in the world today
Takes everything you've got
Taking a break from all your worries
Sure would help a lot
Wouldn't you like to get away?


All those nights when you've got no lights
The check is in the mail
And your little angel hung the cat up by its tail
And your third fiance didn't show


Sometimes you want to go
Where everybody knows your name
And they're always glad you came
You wanna be where you can see
Our troubles are all the same
You wanna be where everybody knows your name


Roll out of bed, Mr. Coffee's dead
The morning's looking bright
And your shrink ran off to Europe and didn't even write
And your husband wants to be a girl
Be glad, there's one place in the world


Where everybody knows your name
And they're always glad you came
You want to go where people know, people are all the same
You want to go where everybody knows your name


Where everybody knows your name
And they're always glad you came
Where everybody knows your name
And they're always glad you came
Where everybody knows your name
And they're always glad you came
