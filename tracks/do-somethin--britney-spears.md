Do you feel this?
I know you feel this
Are you ready?
I don’t think so


Somebody give me my truck
So I can ride on the clouds
So I can turn up the bass like
Somebody pass my guitar
So I can look like a star
And spend this cash like


What you gonna do when the crowd goes 'ayo'?
Why you standing on the wall?
Music starting everywhere
So why don’t you just move along?


I see you lookin' at me
Like I'm some kind of freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don’t you do somethin'?
I see you lookin' at me
Like I got what you need
Get up out of your seat
Why don’t you do somethin'?


Now you all in my grill
'Cause I say what I feel
Only rock to what's real
Baby, bump, bump
But I can't do that with you
Only here with my crew
You can roll if you can
Don’t be a punk, punk


What you gonna do when the crowd goes 'ayo'?
Why you standing on the wall?
Music starting everywhere
So why don’t you just move along?


I see you lookin' at me
Like I'm some kind of freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don’t you do somethin'?
I see you lookin' at me
Like I got what you need
Get up out of your seat
Why don’t you do somethin'?
I see you lookin' at me
Like I'm some kind of freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don’t you do somethin'?
(Uh-huh)


I see you lookin' over here
Can’t you tell I'm havin' fun?
If you know like I know
You would stop starin' at us
And get your own space
And do somethin'


I see you lookin' at me
Like I'm some kind of freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don’t you do somethin'?
I see you lookin' at me
Like I got what you need
Get up out of your seat
Why don’t you do somethin'?
I see you lookin' at me
Like I'm some kind of freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don’t you do somethin'?


Fuck
Do somethin'
Ow!
Why don’t you do somethin'?
