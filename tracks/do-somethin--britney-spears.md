Crazy!
Oh baby baby how was I supposed to know?
That something wasn't right
(Oops, I did it again)
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight
But to lose all my senses
(Show me how you want it to be)
That is just typically me 
(Tell me baby cause I need to know, now)

Oh baby, baby
(Oops, I did it again)
My loneliness is killing me
(I played with your heart)
And I 
I must confess 
(Got lost in the game)
I still believe
(Oh baby, baby)
Still believe
(Oops, you think I'm in love)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
(I'm sent from above)
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

Hush, just stop! 
I'm so into you
You got that somethin' what can I do
I've had enough 
You spin me around
(You spin me around)
The Earth is movin' but 
I can't feel the ground
And you might think
I can't take it
(Everytime you look at me
My heart is jumpin' 
It's easy to see)
But you're wrong

You drive me crazy
(Stronger that yesterday)
I just can't sleep
I'm so exited, I'm in too deep
(Now, it's nothing but my way)
Woah crazy
(Stronger)
But it feel alright
Baby thinkin' of you
Keep me up all night
(Up all night)

Baby, can't you see
I'm calling
A guy like you
Should wear a warning
And you you 
I know what you are
What you are, baby
There's no escape
I can't wait
I need a hit
Baby, give me it

You! (You call me crazy)
You! (I got you crazy)
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer baby
(Too high, can't come down)
I feel the adrenaline runnin' through my veins
(I feel my head spinnin' round and round)
Spotlight on me 
I'm ready to break
(Too high, can't come down)
I'm like a performer
The dancefloor is my stage
(I feel my head spinnin' round and round)
Better be ready
I hope you feel the same

With a taste of your lips 
I'm on a ride
All eyes on me 
In the center of the ring
Just like a circus
A taste of your poison paradise
When I crack that my whip
Everybody gonna trip
Just like a circus
Don't stand there watching me
Follow me
Show me what you can do womanizer
Oh you're a womanizer, oh
Boy don't try the front
I-I just know what you are
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic

(I'm a slave for you)
1,2,3 not only you and me
(I'm a slave for you)
Got on one 80 degrees 
And I'm caught in between
I'm countin'
(I'm a slave for you)
1,2,3 Peter, Paul and Mary
(I'm a slave for you)
Gettin' down a 3P
Everybody loves countin'

In this american dream since I was 17
Don't matter if I step on the scene
Or skink away to the Philippines
There's still gon' take picture of my derriere 
In the magazine
Do you want a piece of me?
You want a piece of me
You want a piece of me
You want a piece of me
This gets in got your tongue tied in knots
I see 
(Gimme, gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more)
Gimme more 
Spit it out cause I'm dying for the company
(Gimme, gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more)

And you feel like paradise and I need a vacation tonight
if I said I want your body now
Gimme, gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more

I notice that you got it
(Shame on me)
You notice that I want it
(Oooooh ooooh)
You know that I can take it
(To need release)
To next level, baby
(Oooooh ooooh)
If you want it good bitch
(Uncontrollably)
Sick than the remix
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight
(-llably -llably -llably)
I can't take it, take it 
Take it no more
Never felt like this before
Come on get me, get me on the floor
Dj what you waiting for?

Woah oh oh oh oh
(I wanna go all the way)
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna show all the dirt 
I got runnin' through my mind
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me
See the sunlight we ain't stoppin'
Keep on the dancing 'till the world ends
If you feel it let it happen 
(Whoa crazy I'm in too deep)
Keep on the dancing 'till the world ends
(My loneliness is killing me)
See the sunlight we ain't stoppin'
(And the taste of your lips I'm on a ride)
Keep on the dancing 'till the world ends
(All eyes on me takin' out my freak tonight)
If you feel it let it happen 
(I'll let you believe we're more than just friend)
Keep on the dancing 'till the world ends

Oops, I did it again 
Can you send me a sign 
I'm addicted to you could
You hit me baby one more time
