Yeah
That be Maaly Raw
Now, now is my time
Now is my time
That be Maaly Raw

Everybody rock with me because I'm up now
Took your girl and I'ma score, like I made the touch-down
Swervin' and the Lambo doors go up, not on the bus now
Used to want a G-Shock, now I'm walking with a bust down
Pull up and I'm flooding with an iced out watch
Whip it look like butter baby, pecan drop
Pick and drop, put that four inside drop
Stack my knots, count a lot, saw a lot
Got them rocks, diamond rocks, whip the pot
Suicide, 1600, that's the block
Hit your girl that's check free
She ainÂ´t used to text me
Now she wanna caress me
She keep tryna neck me
I got' tell my bestie, someone call my bestie
Think I found my bestie, link up make the check bleed
You know that I'm smoking dope, I'll be high til' next week
Know I had to let her go, cause she can't arrest me


Woke up with my toolie, what it do?
Meet me in the ally with the troops
I got red shooters, I got blue
Let that thing down then point at you
Bentley or a Rari, ho, lets choose
We gon' the rob the bank, bring the loot
We gon' take the boy back to school
Money on the floor just like some shoes


Stackin', Rackin', all hunnids I'm packin'
My life it is like a movie minus all the actin'
Jacket, jack it, yeah it's made of rabbit
Diamonds on my neck and wrist they compliment that karats
You ain't nuthin' but a mockingbird, boy you a parrot!
Oops, yeah my bad, that's your girl? We could share it
Might buy her diamonds and pearls, but can't marry
She, said my D-Bomb like a terrorist
He, thinkin' he on but man, that's barely
We, rock all white ice look like dairy
Keys, my red hellcat it sound scary
Please, you talk shit and you get buried
See, ain't no fuck nigga around me
I said free my dogs from the county
Yeah, the ones on the run from the bounty
Yeah, diamonds they so wet, need some bounty


Woke up with my toolie, what it do?
Meet me in the ally with the troops
I got red shooters, I got blue
Let that thing down then point at you
Bentley or a Rari, ho, lets choose
We gon the rob the bank, bring the loot
We gon take the boy back to school
Money on the floor just like some shoes
