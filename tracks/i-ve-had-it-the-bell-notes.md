La la la la la
When I saw her on the corner
Then I knew that I was a goner
I've had it
Well I've had it
When you say that I should phone
Then I do and there's nobody home
I've had it
Well I've had it
La la la la la
La la la la la
When you say that you'll keep a date
Then you show up two hours late
I've had it
Well I've had it
When you say that you love me honey
When you really need my money
I've had it
Well I've had it
La la la la la
