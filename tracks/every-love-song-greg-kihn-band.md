Now we aren't strangers but we never met
Once I got some I want all I can get
What can I say now you already know
It starts with a feeling it grows and it grows
The cafe is crowded a room full of noise
Music is loud and you don't have a choice
Used to be a song about people I knew
But somehow they all seem to be about you

Now every love song (Every love song)
Every love song (Every love song)
Every love song (Every love song)
Is going to be for us tonight

Now every love song (Every love song)
Every love song (Every love song)
Every love song (Every love song)
Is going to be for us tonight

In a crowd we're all alone
Music is playing but it's all wrong
You know the words and you know the tune
But it always seems to end too soon
You got me turning around and around
The people are talking I don't hear a sound
I search the sky and I wonder why
I can't relax and I can't get high

Every love song (Every love song)
Every love song (Every love song)
Every love song (Every love song)
Is going to be for us tonight

Every love song (Every love song)
Every love song (Every love song)
Every love song (Every love song)
Is going to be for us tonight (Every love song)

Love is what you need
Love is what you have
It's what you need
Love songs

Every love song (Every love song)
Every love song (Every love song)
Every love song (Every love song)
Is going to be for us tonight

Comeon baby
