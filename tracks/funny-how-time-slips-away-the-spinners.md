Well hello there
Ah, it's been a long, long time
How am I doin'?
Well, I guess I'm doin' fine

It's been so long now
But it seems like it was only yesterday
Ain't it funny, it's so funny how time can slip right away?

How's your new love?
Oh, I hope he's doin' fine
I heard you told him
That you're gonna love him, till the end of time

Oh, that's the same thing that you told me
It seems like just the other day
Ain't it funny, it's so funny how time can just slip right away?

I gotta go now
Oh I guess, I'll see you somewhere 'round
But you never can tell, you never can tell
You never can tell when I'll be back in town

Oh please remember
What I told you, "In time you're gonna pay"
Ain't it funny, it's so funny how time slips right away?
