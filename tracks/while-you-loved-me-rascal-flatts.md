If I ever write the story of my life
Don't be surprised if you're where it begins
Girl, I'd have to dedicate every line on every page
To the memories we made, while you loved me


I was born the day you kissed me
And I died inside the night you left me
But I lived, oh how I lived
(I lived)While you loved me

I'd start with chapter one, love innocent and young
As a morning sun on a new day
Even though I know the end, Well I'd do it all again
'Cause I got a lifetime in while you loved me
