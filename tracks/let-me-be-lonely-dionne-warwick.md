Oh, let me be lonely
I wanna be faithful and honest
And true to the one I love
The one I love

Oh, let me be lonely
I've gotta be someone he's proud
To come home to some happy day
What a day that will be

I wanna be there, be there by the door
When he comes back to me
If I deceive him even once, I couldn't face him
Oh, I know I couldn't face him

If I give in to loneliness
And hold you tight
All through the night

Oh, let me, let me be lonely
'Cause I love him only
Oh, let me be, oh, let me be
Let me be lonely

I wanna be there, be there by his side
All through my life and if I ever let him down
I have to tell him, oh yes, I have to tell him
And if I did, what could he do?
He'd say goodbye and I would die, yes

Let me, let me be lonely
'Cause I love him only
Oh, let me be, oh, let me be
Oh, let me be, let me, let me
Oh, won't you let me be lonely

Oh yeah, let me be lonely
Oh, oh, yeah, let me be lonely, yeah
I'll be, let me be lonely
