(The pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue)

Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Wrap your presents to your darling from you
Pretty pencils to write I love you
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue

Crowded street, busy feet, hustle by him
Downtown shoppers, Christmas is nigh
There he sits all alone on the sidewalk (ah)
Hoping that you won't pass him by (oo oo oh)

Should you stop? Better not, much too busy
You're in a hurry, my how time does fly
In the distance the ringing of laughter (ohhohoh
And in the midst of the laughter he cries

Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Wrap your presents to your darling from you
Pretty pencils to write I love you
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue (ohhoh
