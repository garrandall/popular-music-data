I'm in love, alright
With my crazy, beautiful life
With the parties, the disasters
With my friends all pretty & plastered

Every night we're down to go out
Waking up on a different couch
'Til the next night on the next flight
Yeah, I guess we're doing alright

Oh, oh, oh
We're falling in love
Oh, oh, oh
'Til the sun's coming up
Oh, oh, oh
Just living the life
Oh, oh, oh

Every single night we fight
To get a little high on life
To get a little something right
Something real, at least we try

Time after time
try dodging all the douche-bag guys
Try trading all the wasted times
For something real in this crazy life

I just hope some people see
There's nothing that I'm trying to be
Let me just stop all the shit talk
I know I'm the new bitch on the block

I've been through my sketchy phases
Been broke, been a shitty waitress
But I'm not now, guess it worked out
Got here by running my mouth

Oh, oh, oh
We're falling in love
Oh, oh, oh
'Til the sun's coming up
Oh, oh, oh
Just living the life
Oh, oh, oh

Every single night we fight
To get a little high on life
To get a little something right
Something real, at least we try

Time after time
Try dodging all the douche-bag guys
Try trading all the wasted times
For something real in this crazy life

Every single night we...

Every single night we fight
To get a little high on life
To get a little something right
Something real, at least we try

Time after time
try dodging all the douche-bag guys
Try trading all the wasted times
For something real in this crazy life

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
