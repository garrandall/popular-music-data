If you read in the paper that I went away
Would it make any difference to you?
If I packed my things and left town today
Would it make any difference to you?

Do you, do you even know?
Do you even know that I'm still alive?

Oh, I wonder
I wonder if I ever, oh, cross
If I ever cross your sweet mind

If I got in, if I got into trouble
Would I send for you?
Would you come, would you come
Or would you stay away?

If we never love again
Like we used to do
Would it make, oh
Would it make any difference to you?
