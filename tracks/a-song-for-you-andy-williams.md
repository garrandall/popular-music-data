I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my love in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singin' this song for you

I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but baby can't you see (baby can't you see now)
There's no one more important to me (baby)
Baby can't you please see through me
'cause we're alone now and I'm singin' this song for you

You taught me precious secrets of the truth, withholding' nothin'
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody (listen to the melody) cause my love's in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life, you are a friend of mine (you are a friend of mine)
And when my life is over, remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singin' this song for you
We were alone and I was singin' this song for you
We were alone and I was singin' this song, singin' this song for you
