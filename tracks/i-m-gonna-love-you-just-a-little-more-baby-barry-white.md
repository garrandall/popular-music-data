It feels so good
You lying here next to me
Oh, what a groove
You have no idea how it feels
My hands just won't keep still
I love you, baby
Oh, I love you, I love you, I love you
I just wanna hold you
Run my fingers through your hair
Oh
Outta sight
Uh-huh, right there, you like it like that
Closer
Come here, closer, close
Oh, baby
Oh, baby


Give it up
Ain't no use
I can't help myself if I'd wanted to
I'm hung up
No doubt
I'm so in love with you
For me there's no way out, 'cause


Deeper and deeper
In love with you I'm falling
Sweeter and sweeter
Your tender words of love keep calling
Eager and eager, yeah
To feel your lips upon my face
Please her and please her
Any time or any place


I'm gonna love you, love you, love you
Just a little more, baby
I'm gonna need you, need you, need you
Every day, yeah
I'm gonna want you, want you, want you
In every way, yeah


Make no mistake
For I'll
Hold back
Knowin'
This time it looks like love is here to stay
As long as I shall live
I'll give you all I have and all I have to give, 'cause


Please her and please her
Any time or any place
Eager and eager
To feel your sweet lips on my face
Deeper and deeper
In love with you I'm falling, yeah
Sweeter and sweeter
Your tender words of love keep calling


I'm gonna love you, love you, love you
Just a little more, baby
I'm gonna need you, need you, need you
Every day
I'm gonna want you, want you, want you
In every way, yeah


Oh, stop that babe
'Cause I swear to God you understand
I can't, I can't believe that I'm
That I'm really here
It's like, it's like sometimes baby
You are somethin', you are somethin'
Such a groove, it's hard to believe you're really there doin' it
You hear what I'm sayin'?
Baby, don't stop
I swear, don't stop
Hey hey hey hey, yeah
Ohhh baby, that's outta sight
Uhh huh huh
Ohh baby, oh baby

Oh I love you, I love you, I love you


I'm gonna love you, love you, love you
Just a little more, baby
I'm gonna need you, need you, need you
Every day
I'm gonna want you, want you, want you
In every way, yeah


Stick to me
Stick
Oh get down, baby, get down
Down down
Ohhhhhh, such a groove
