You're near
That moment's here
I'm almost in your arms
Tonight, the mood is right
I'm almost in your arms

One sigh
One word and I
Will rush to your embrace
Say that certain word
Sigh that certain sigh
And will all my heart
To your arms I'll fly

It's strange
How we are changed
By things that seem so small
One look
Can write a book
One touch can say it all

We've known
Those nights alone
And now we found our way
I'm almost in your arms
Almost in your arms to stay

(Say that certain word)
(Sigh that certain sigh)
(And will all my heart)
Yeah, to your arms I'll fly

It's strange
How we are changed
By things that seem so small
One look
Can write a book
One touch can say it all

We've known
Those nights alone
And now we found our way
I'm almost in your arms
Almost in your arms
Almost in your arms to stay
