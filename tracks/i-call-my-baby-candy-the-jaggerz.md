Call my baby candy
She's sweet as sweet can be
Call my baby candy
She lays those candy kisses on me

When me and my baby go shopping
Don't have to buy her a brand new dress
She digs potato chips and licorice sticks
And that's the key to her happiness

Don't have to spend a whole lot of money (Money)
And yet the girl still calls me honey (Honey)
A little help from milk chocolate
Should see the results I get

Call my baby candy
She's sweet as sweet can be
Call my baby candy
She lays those candy kisses on me

And when I pick her up at home
To take her out on a date
Don't have to take her to a fancy restaurant
For a five dollar cheapo steak

She'd rather go to a drive-in movie (Movie)
Where the popcorn sure is groovy (Groovy)
A little help from milk chocolate
Should see the results I get

Call my baby candy
She's sweet as sweet can be
Call my baby candy
She lays those candy kisses on me

Call my baby candy
She's sweet as sweet can be
Call my baby candy
She lays those candy kisses on me

Call my baby candy
She's sweet as sweet can be
