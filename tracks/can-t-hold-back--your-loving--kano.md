Come to me she calls me ( I really need your lovin’)
Come to me I need you (right now)
Come to me oh baby ( I wanna feel your lovin’)
Come to me I want you ( right now)

She’s got what it takes / she can pin you to the floor
She knows just what she’ll do to you
She’s dynamite dynamite

You can’t hold back don’t fall for her she’s coming
You just can’t hold back your lovin’
(you know you can’t resist her)

You can’t hold back don’t fall for her she’s coming
You just can’t hold back your lovin’
( that girl is out to get ya)
(break)

Come to me she calls me (i really need your lovin’)
Come to me I need you (right now)
Come to me oh baby (i wanna feel your lovin’)
Come to me I want you (right now)

She’s got what it takes she can pin you to the floor
She knows just what she will do to you
She’s dynamite, dynamite

You can’t hold back, don’t fall for her she’s coming
You just can’t hold back your lovin’
(you know you can’t resist her)

You can’t hold back, don’t fall for her she’s coming
You just can’t hold back your lovin’
(that girl is gonna get ya)
(break)

Come to me she calls me (i really need your lovin’)
Come to me I need you (right now)
Come to me oh baby (i wanna be your lovin’)
Come to me I want you ( right now)

You can’t hold back, don’t fall for her she’s coming
You just can’t hold back your lovin’
(you know you can’t resist her)

You can’t hold back don’t fall for her she’s coming
You just can’t hold back your lovin’
(that girl is out to get ya)
(break)

Come to me she calls me (i really need your lovin’)
Come to me I need you (right now)
Come to me oh baby (i wanna feel your lovin’)
Come to me I want you (right now)

She’s got what it takes she can pin you to the floor
She knows just what she will do to you
She’s dynamite, dynamite

You can’t hold back don’t fall for her she’s coming
You just can’t hold back your lovin’)
(you know you can’t resist her)
You can’t hold back, don’t fall for her she’s coming
You just can’t hold back your lovin’
(that girl is out to get ya)
(break)

Come to me she calls me (verse)

She’s got what it takes (bridge)

You can’t hold back don’t fall for her she’s coming
(break)

Come to me oh baby
