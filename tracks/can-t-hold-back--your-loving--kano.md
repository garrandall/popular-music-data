there are lots of signs in life
some that you may not like
you could be living this minute
the next minute your gone away
so hold up your heads my brothers
and be concious my sisters
and by the worse you will get paid


true, you can move food on the streets
did a bit of that got bored of that
didnt move the brown or da crack
use to pick up for the facts
I could make more back by breaking down to scores n that
Stack to buy out the stores n that
Didn't give a shit about laws or that
But I did give a shit about getting locked up
Or get boxed up, sentenced you'll get about 4 for that
Crap, you aint so rich now
I bet you feel like a prick now
Coz where's all your fancy shit now
Where's your whips, chicks and your bits now
Shit, you should have fixed up
Fuck drugs, the mic you should have picked up
And it was all for the big bucks
Now you're sitting in a cell doing sit ups
Blood I told you this shit's fucked
The ghetto lifestyle's too much
If I bust, be proud of me
But you can't take it out of me
So im a bit stuck
But, I got too much to lose now
Love my life, and I don't wanna lose out
Im still about, Im home sweet home
In the ends, like I don't wanna move out
Im too proud




Look, you can do moves on the street
Id rather spit bars on the beat
Id rather that than nick cars every week
But jack is when I split scars with the heat
So Im solo like the guitars and the beat
But this rhyming shit is for me
I live this, drink this, eat this, shit this
And I've even writ bars in my sleep
But I aint on hype, I've had enough phase
Ghetto's probably inside, hope he bust K's
That undergrounds like roll this, a tough race
You can be living this minute, then gone again like mum you was right
And I was wrong again
But Im strong again
Still moved on again
Ten more minutes and I writ another song again
If I can do it, you can im a true fan
Up and coming MC's big up you man
The doors open but I aint through man
Im'a ball through like a cue dan
Watch me, aint gonna let no-one stop me
UK im gonna break you properly
And If you aint gonna watch me do that, move back
Who's that? K-A â¦ I knew that
And I know its not easy, and I know what you're feeling
Just believe me




I fear my safety, I fear im bait, but I cant put my skills to waste
Because if you're living by the gun you surely will get blazed
I still gon' blaze, refuse to smoke my life away
Refuse to die before I try then put the mic away
This life of K, is just one big hype for praise
Right, night, record then start to write okay
But Im just saying, back on hype of Kane
But only Im to blame
Today I saw the signs that came, and it's got a good look
But that's life they say, crime pays
And Ill stop crime whenever this grime decides to pay
But grime aint making me mill's
So Im picking up a 9 today
And spittin' aint getting me deals
But this shits just getting real
