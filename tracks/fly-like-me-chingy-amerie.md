Now you done been around the world,
And you'd seen alot of girls,
But, you ain't neva seen a girl look so fly like,
Now you done rolled through some hoods,
There's some girls that look good,
But, you ain't never seen a girl look so fly like,
And you partied, and have hugs
And sum girls sho you love,
But, you ain't never seen a girl look so fly like me
Baby, But chu never had a girl look so fly like me.

Now I'd done been around the world thought I'd seen it all
Er color, er shape, what I need and all,
Switch like seasons, when the summers, spring, & fall,
And back seat of my jeep, I'm chrome veet & all.
On the hunt for these girls were like my day to day,
I get em alone I jump em and den fade away,
I give it good so some of them won't stay away,
They try to lock me up, but I break away.
And to the day I lay my eyes on the princess,
And you can tell she was a dime from a distance,
It took a minute to come to my senses,
Shes the perfect match and god is my witness,
Now for the first time I've opened my eyes,
Put the glass in the air, now I toast to the sky,
Feels like I'm in heaven, & I'm hoping to fly,
Baby girl come along for the ride, you know why cuhs I

Now you done been around the world,
And you'd seen alot of girls,
But, you ain't neva seen a girl look so fly like,
Now you done rolled through some hoods,
There's some girls that look good,
But, you ain't never seen a girl look so fly like,
And you partied, and have hugs,
And sum girls sho you love,
But, you ain't never seen a girl look so fly like me
Baby, But chu never had a girl look so fly like me.

Now I ain't neva had a girl that was so fly,
Other guys come around, you acting so shy,
You got em shaking in their boots, and I know why,
Cuhs they can't handle the truth and that's no lie,
As for me, I'm the one that you been dreaming on,
And wen you saw me I'm the one that you were steaming on,
And when you need it I'm the shoulder that you would be leaning on,
Take off that guchi and keep them vickie sneakers on,
Let's take a flight because the world is our playground,
And buy houses from the lou, to the A-Town,
It's silk sheets so it's soft when you lay down,
Ching-a-ling yea, I get down, and stay down,
There's no one better baby girl you'sz a blessing,
You got me heading in a positive direction,
You got my vote, when you re-up for election,
Cuhs all I wanna do is give you love and affection.

Why you wasting your time, & boy, running the streets,
When you can just come to me? (huh)
You know I got what you need,
I got what you want,
Boy, won't you come and see?
What if you never, (seen) a girl like me ever, (like me before)?
Won't you come inside, let me keep it dry,
Cuhs, I'm, so, flyyyyy.
