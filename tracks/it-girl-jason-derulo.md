Oh yeah
Oh yeah


I been looking under rocks and breaking locks
Just tryna find ya
I been like a maniac, insomniac
5 steps behind ya
Tell them other girls, they can hit the exit, check please
'Cause I finally found the girl of my dreams
Much more than a Grammy award
That's how much you mean to me


You can be my it girl, baby, you the shit, girl
Loving you could be a crime
Crazy how we fit, girl, this is it, girl
Give me 25 to life
I just wanna rock, all night long
And put you in the middle of my spotlight
You could be my it, girl, you're my biggest hit, girl
Let me play it loud, let me play it loud like
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Let me play it loud, let me play it loud like
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Let me play it loud


You can't help but turn them heads, knocking 'em dead
Dropping like flies around you
If I get your body close, not letting go
Hoping you're about to
Tell them other guys they can lose your number, you're done
They don't get another shot 'cause you're love drunk
Like a TV show playing reruns
Every chance I get, I'ma turn you on


You can be my it girl, baby, you the shit, girl
Loving you could be a crime
Crazy how we fit, girl, this is it, girl
Give me 25 to life (hey)
I just wanna rock, all night long
And put you in the middle of my spotlight (hey, yeah)
You could be my it, girl, you're my biggest hit, girl
Let me play it loud, let me play it loud like (hey, yeah)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (oh, yeah)
Let me play it loud, let me play it loud like
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Let me play it loud


Can't seem to stop you from running, running
Through my, through my mind, mind
Just keep it coming, coming
'Til I make you mine, mine
You've got that something, something, I wanna be with, girl
You're my greatest hit, girl, just say this is it, girl
Hey, baby
Don't you know you're my it, girl?


You can be my it girl, baby, you the shit, girl (ooh, woo)
Loving you could be a crime
Crazy how we fit, girl, this is it, girl (woo)
Give me 25 to life (give me 25 to life, baby)
I just wanna rock, all night long
And put you in the middle of my spotlight (oh, yeah)
You could be my it, girl, you're my biggest hit, girl (oh, yeah)
Let me play it loud, let me play it loud like (I'ma play it loud like)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Let me play it loud, let me play it loud like (baby, let me play it loud like, yeah)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Let me play it loud
Let me hear you sing like
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Everybody in the crowd let me hear you singing like
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
This is it, girl
