May I, my lady...
Escort you to Jefferson ball?
Yeah

My clothes on tough satin
My horse, not the white one
I bear deeper riches
No thang, no, no
But I have been waiting
Anticipating
In hopes that my lady
I might take you to the ball
And love you, it's all

May I, my lady
May I, my lady
Escort you to Jefferson ball?
Yeah

I've seen you each morning
Since you were a baby
And now you're the queen of my heart
Maybe one day I'll know you
Maybe then I'll show you
My plan to see castles
On Venus and Mars
We'll make love in the stars

May I, my lady (may I, my lady)
May I, my lady (may I, my lady)
Escort you to Jefferson ball?

May I my lady, now may I?
Now may I, my lady, now may I?
May I my lady, now may I?
Now may I, my lady, now may I?
May I my lady, now may I?
Now may I, my lady, now may I?
May I my lady, now may I?
Now may I, my lady, now may I?

If you come to the ball
And we love after all
When the dancing is through
I'll make sure of you
There's no need to say no
If you do, I won't go
There'll be no ball

When you come to the ball

Yeah...

You know, in our livetimes, of living, learning, loving each other
There comes a time when we all must kinda like... just sit down
Think about the love we give to one another
It's not a hard thing to give up the feeling, whether it be black or white
There's no color to the feel, the love makes anything alright
So think love, feel love, try love, taste love
Know love, grow love, touch love, it's yours

You're not black, you're not white
You're not cool as the ice
You're not high as the sun
You're my lover one
And you make me those things
And you teach me to sing
I feel in your arms
I'm the only one

Baby
Baby
Baby
Baby...

May lady, my lady, my lady
Could it be I...
