We Were Holding Hands
In The Park
We Had To Hurry Home Before It's Dark
I Can't Wait To See Your Smile Again
And I Love The Time We Spend
I Waited For The Break Of Day To Come
So I Could See Your Smile In The Sun
I Guess I Couldn't Wait To Get To School
To See Your Pretty Face
I've Got To Stay Cool
Break It Down


Girl Don't Leave Me, Don't Leave Me
Oh, The You Receive Me
Don't Take This As An Aggression
Girl I Learned My Lesson
Don't Leave Me, Oh
The Natural Way You Receive Me
Don't Take This As An Aggression
That's Why


I Just Want To Be Alone With You
And There's Nothing Else
I'd Rather Do
I Just Want The Chance I Had Again
Just Us Two, Til The End


Now Just The Other Night
On The Phone
I Tried To Impress You With My Tone
I've Got To Be For Real
If You're My Friend
Or You'll Never Call Me Back Again
