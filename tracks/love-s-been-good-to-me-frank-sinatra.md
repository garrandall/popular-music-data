I have been a rover I have walked alone
Hiked a hundred highways never found a home
Still in all I'm happy the reason is you see
Once in a while along the way love's been good to me

There was a girl in Denver before the summer storm
Oh, her eyes were tender, oh, her arms were warm
And she could smile away that thunder, kiss away the rain
Even though she's gone away you won't hear me complain

I have been a rover I have walked alone
Hiked a hundred highways never found a home
Still in all I'm happy the reason is you see
Once in a while along the way love's been good to me

There was a girl in Portland before the winter chill
We used to go out courtin' along October Hill
And she could laugh away the dark clouds, cry away the snow
It seems like only yesterday as down the road I go

I've been a rover I have walked alone
Hiked a hundred highways never found a home
Still in all I'm happy the reason is you see
Once in a while along the way love's been good to me
