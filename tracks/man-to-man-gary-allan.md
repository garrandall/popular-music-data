You're throwing around a lot of serious accusations
Ain't too hard to tell what you're insinuating
You think I'm the one who stole her away
And if not for me she'd still be yours today
We're both men here so why play games
Why don't we call a spade a spade?


Man to man, tell me the truth, tell me
Were you ever there when she needed you?
Man to man, look me in the eye, tell me
If you really loved her, why'd you make her cry?
Man to man, well who cheated who?
You're the one to blame, tell me it ain't true
Man to man, man to man


Well, you think all your anger is justified
Me, I think, it's just your wounded pride
What did you really think she was gonna do?
She's a real woman, not a doormat for you
You want her back, but it's too late
Why don't we just cut to the chase?


Man to man, tell me the truth, tell me
Were you ever there when she needed you?
Man to man, look me in the eye, tell me
If you really loved her, why'd you make her cry?
Man to man, well who cheated who?
You're the one to blame, tell me it ain't true
Man to man


Man to man, tell me the truth, tell me
Were you ever there when she needed you?
Man to man, look me in the eye, tell me
If you really loved her, why'd you make her cry?
Man to man, well who cheated who?
You're the one to blame, tell me it ain't true
Man to man, man to man


Man to man to man to man to man to man to man
Man to man to man to man to man to man to man
