(Brett Bouldin: This love's for real)


Can't you see how I feel baby?
I never felt this way before
You know what you did to me
(This love's for real)
Can't you see how I feel?
(This love's for real)


I can't ignore the way I feel about you
Baby, I just want you to be mine
And all along waiting for your tender touch
So I hope you give this love a try


Can't you see just how I feel?
It's for you
Don't you know this love is real?
It's for you

Can't you see?


I can't deny the way I feel inside
I've been wondering if you're for real
And I like your style, your eyes and smile
Boy, you turn me on
I just wish that you were in my life


Can't you see just how I feel?
It's for you (It's for you)
Don't you know this love is real?
It's for you (It's for you)

Can't you see?


Baby, maybe you'll be my lady
Dream of us together but my vision's hazy
Whenever you're in need, it’s myself I offer
Soft spot in my heart and it's getting softer
Weather the storm, hon, and nothing will harm ya
My ebony queen, well, I'm your knight in armor
I wish I could tell you how I feel
Here’s a kiss *smooch* this love's for real

Can't you see just how I feel?
It's for you (It's for you)
Don't you know this love is real?
It's for you (It's for you)


Can't you see how I feel?
Don't you know this love is real?
It's for you (It's for you)

Can’t you see just how I feel?
(I love you, baby. I want you, baby)
It’s for you
Don’t you know this love is real?
It’s for you (It’s for you) It’s for you


Can’t you see how I feel?
Don’t you know this love is real?
It’s for you
