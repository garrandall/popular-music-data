Queen of the night
Life of the party 
It's all an illusion
You can't hide that big a heart ache
So stop the delusion
Waitin' for someone's rescue
My arms are right here for you


Through the wind and the rain
Through the laughter and pain 
Count on me
And when life isn't fair and there's nobody there
I will be 
In a world of pretenders 
I am your defender
And when it all comes down
I'll be the last one standing

This is for life don't ever doubt it
You've already fallen
Love is alive so stand up and shout it
'Cause destiny's callin'
The others who stand behind me
They don't look nothin' like me



Waitin' for someone's rescue
My arms are right here for you



Yeah yeah
I'll be the last one standing
Through the wind and the rain 
Through the laughter and pain
I'll be the last one standing
