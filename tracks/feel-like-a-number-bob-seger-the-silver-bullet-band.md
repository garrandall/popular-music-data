I take my card and I stand in line
To make a buck I work overtime
Dear Sir letters keep coming in the mail

I work my back till it's racked with pain
The boss can't even recall my name
I show up late and I'm docked
It never fails

I feel like just another
Spoke in a great big wheel
Like a tiny blade of grass
In a great big field, whoa

To workers I'm just another drone
To Ma Bell I'm just another phone
I'm just another statistic on a sheet

To teachers I'm just another child
To IRS I'm just another file
I'm just another consensus on the street

Gonna cruise out of this city
Head down to the sea
Gonna shout out at the ocean
Hey it's me

And I feel like a number
Feel like a number
Feel like a stranger
A stranger in this land

I feel like a number
I'm not a number
I'm not a number
Dammit I'm a man
I said I'm a man

Gonna cruise out of this city
Head down to the sea
Gonna shout out at the ocean
Hey, it's me

And I feel like a number
Feel like a number
Feel like a stranger
A stranger in this land

I feel like a number
I'm not a number
I'm not a number
Damn it, I'm a man

I feel like a number
Feel like a number
Feel like a number

I feel like a
I feel
Feel like a
Feel like a

I feel like a
I feel like a
