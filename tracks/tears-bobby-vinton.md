Tears for souvenirs
Are all you left me
Memories of a love
You never meant

I just can't believe
You could forget me
After all the happy hours
We spent together

Tears have been my only consolation
But tears can't mend a broken heart
I must confess

Let's forgive and forget
Turn our tears of regret
Once more to tears of happiness

Tears have been my only consolation
But tears can't mend a broken heart
I must confess

Let's forgive and forget
Turn our tears of regret
Once more to tears of happiness

Let's change our tears to happiness
