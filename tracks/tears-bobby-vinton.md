My tears are fallin' 
'cause you've taken her away 
And though it really hurts me so 
There's something that I've gotta say 

Take good care of my baby
Please don't ever make her blue
Just tell her that you love her 
Make sure you're thinking of her 
In everything you say and do

Aww, take good care of my baby
Now don't you ever make her cry
Just let your love surround her 
Paint a rainbow all around her 
Don't let her see a cloudy sky 

Once upon a time that little girl was mine 
If I'd been true,
I know she'd never be with you 

So, take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover 
That you don't really love her 
Just send my baby back home to me 

Well, take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover 
That you don't really love her 
Just send my baby back home to me 

Aww, take good care of my baby
Well, take good care of my baby
Just, take good care of my baby
