You don't know what it means, yeah
To lose the one you love
You don't know how I pray, yeah, yeah
To the one up above
Whoa-oh, I went to my doctor
I tried everything he had
He said, I can't help you, son
Cause what you've got, you know you've got it bad
You don't know baby but I'm in love with you
Well, I lay inside at night with tears streaming down
And on my face there's a frown
Won't somebody help me win this wicked race
So I can see my baby face to face
You don't know what it means, no, no
To be a little lonely
You don't know what I mean, baby
When I say I've been blue
Whoa-oh, have you had the blues so bad
Till it hurts your feet to walk?
And now that it's time for your hurt, baby
And now it hurts your tongue to talk
Ha! You don't know, baby
But I'm in love with you
Well, if you know what I mean
Baby, if you know the pain
You would stop my tears from falling
Falling down like rain
Ha! You don't know baby, but I'm in love with you
Hey, I'm in love, I'm in love, baby
I'm in love, I need you so bad
Baby won't you come on, come on, come on
Come on...
