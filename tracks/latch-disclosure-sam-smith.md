(Never )

You lift my heart up when the rest of me is down (never)
You, you enchant me even when you're not around (never)
If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down (never)
I'm latching on, babe, now I know what I have found (never)

I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?

Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you (never)
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you (never)

Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you (never)
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you (never)

I'm so encaptured, got me wrapped up in your touch (never)
Feel so enamored, hold me tight within your clutch (never)
How do you do it, you got me losing every breath (never)
What did you give me to make my heart beat out my chest (never)?

I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?
I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?

Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you (never)
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you (never)

Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you (never)
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you (never)

Latching on to you (I'm latching on to you)
I won't let go of you (never) (No, I won't let go)
Latching on to you (How you wanna get down)
I won't let go of you
(I won't let go, I won't let go)

(I won't let go, I won't let go)

Never
Never
