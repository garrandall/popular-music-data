Loser, loser

It's so hard being a loser
Always trying to find a way
To overcome this heartache inside
And find happiness someday

Listen to me
Look upon this empty face
And you'll see a lonely man
So all alone, so far from home

Reaching out for happiness
Only finding emptiness
Someone please
Won't you help me

I walk in silent solitude
Shattered dream never came true
Many night I cried, unsatisfied

A dark cloud's hanging over me
My life leads to nowhere
No peaceful times
I've known were mine

It's so hard, yes, it is, being a loser
Always trying to find a way
(I know it's so hard)
To overcome this heartache inside
And find happiness someday

I don't wanna be a loser, oh, no

Need a touch of tenderness
Lead me out of this wilderness
Please help me find
Some peace of mind

Endlessly, I wander on
Looking for hope to build a?
Oh, someone see, I'm so alone

It's so hard (it's so hard)
Being a loser
