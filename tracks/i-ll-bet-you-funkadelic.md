Ice cubes on a red hot stove will melt, and I'll bet ya,
A drowning man bet his first words are help, and I'll bet ya,
If you bet on a horse and the horse don't win, you lose, and I'll bet ya,
If you try, to sit on air, you're gonna fall, and I'll bet ya,

If you want a winning hand,
If you want a perfect man,
I'll bet you never lose with love,
I'm gonna win, and I'll bet ya,
Bet you never lose with love,
I'm gonna win, and I'll bet ya,

Take a car, without fuel, it ain't gonna move, and I'll bet ya,
A carpenter can't build his house without any tools, and I'll bet ya,
If your shoes are too small, they hurt your feet, and I'll bet ya,
And you can't know what's goin' on, if you're asleep, oh I'll bet ya,

If you want a winning hand,
If you want a perfect man,
I'll bet you never lose with love,
I'm gonna win, and I'll bet ya,
Bet you never lose with love,
I know I'm gonna win, and I'll bet ya,

Oh, (oh
Aaargh, argh

I'll bet you never lose with love,
I'm gonna win, and I'll bet ya,
Bet you never lose with love,
I know I'm gonna win, and I'll bet ya
