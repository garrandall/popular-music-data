Baby, I-I-I can't wait

My love, tell me what it's all about
You've got somethin' that I can't live without
Happiness is so hard to find
Hey baby tell me what is on your mind

'Cause I can't wait
Baby 'til you call me on the telephone
I can't wait
Baby 'til we're all alone
I can't wait

You know I love you even when you don't try
I know that our love can never die
Hey darlin' when you look into my eyes
Please tell me you'll never have to say goodbye

'Cause I can't wait
This is what I've been waitin' for
I can't wait
Baby, 'til my love walks in the door
I can't wait
Baby, true love is so hard to find
I found yours you found mine
I can't wait
Tell me what is on your mind

I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait

No, I can't wait
Say it one more time
Tell me what is on your mind
'Cause I can't wait
This is what I've been waiting for
I can't wait
Baby, 'til my love walks in the door
