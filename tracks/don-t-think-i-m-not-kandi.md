Now I don't have to question
Where you were last night
'Cause I already know what you will say
I already know you'll lie
But I can't be mad at ya
'Cause there's something that you don't know
Then when you're gone I do my own thing
And I catch a bone while you're doggin' me


When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not
When you're feeling good
In somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not, 'cause I'm out getting mine
When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not
When you're feeling good
In somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not, 'cause I'm out getting mine


When I tried to get your attention
You ignored me every time
You were so caught up doin' your dirt that
You didn't notice mine
Well I couldn't put up with your schemin'
And I couldn't put up with your lies
They say two wrongs don't make a right but
But It's suiting me just fine


When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not
When you're feeling good
In somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not, 'cause I'm out getting mine
When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not
When you're feeling good
In somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not, 'cause I'm out getting mine (I'm not)


Don't be so surprised to know that sometimes women play the field
You may not believe it, but it's real, the game is so real (So real)
So real, so real
Oh, don't think we won't know it
When you're out in the club


When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not
When you're feeling good
In somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not, 'cause I'm out getting mine
When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not
When you're feeling good
In somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not, 'cause I'm out getting mine


When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not
When you're feeling good
In somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not, 'cause I'm out getting mine (-I-I-I)
When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not
When you're feeling good
In somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not, 'cause I'm out getting mine
