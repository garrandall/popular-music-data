Cross fire cross fire cross fire
Me and my baby we were doing fine

When he started dancing he was mine oh mine
Started doing the cross fire cross fire cross fire
And I know it was a big old time
When they started doing that crazy dance
Well that was the ruin of our big romance
Started doing the cross fire cross fire cross fire
And I never never had a chance
Everybody was cross fire
Cross fire cross fire nothing to it

Keep your eyes on your guy
And kiss your baby goodbye
I look for my baby but he ain't in view
I'm looking like crazy what could I do
They're doing the cross fire cross fire cross fire
And I found it when the dance was through
Cross fire cross fire get down to it
Cross fire

Keep your eyes on your guy
And kiss your baby goodbye
They're doing the monkey and the pony too
They do something crazy like the hippies do
They're doing the cross fire cross fire cross fire
Caught in the middle of the cross fire
Yeah everybody's doing cross fire
