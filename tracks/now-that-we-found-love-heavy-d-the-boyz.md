You said "good-bye" leaving the words behind
As the oversized umbrella watches you go passing by.
Tears of rain make the city sky look sorry,
But even with the heavy mists nothing makes me hard to see
I really want this time to last forever like the rain,
So I drove my heart held you in my arms and gave you all I had

How could I repress our memories so fast, my love
Baby, I'll be crying over you all through the night
Should somebody try to take you away, from me
I'd rather hold you tight like my captive for eternity

Silent nights feeling your warm embrace,
My heart and mind were mesmerized by your gracious love...
But now I know I took this love for granted
When the troubled waves came crashing down you looked for me with empty hope
Did you find another shoulder to shed your tears tonight?
Now it's too late, you've closed your door we will never be the same

How could I repress those memories so fast, my love
Baby, I'll be crying over you all through the night
Should somebody try to take you away, from me
I'd rather hold you tight for eternity

Realized with these rain drops failing down on me,
I wanted to, but it wasn't me that could cherish you sweetly
Words cannot express the feelings and emotions inside
Lonely words cannot define this love chemistry
Wandering alone, my love has nowhere else to move on
So I held on to my thoughts and allowed my heart to guide me
