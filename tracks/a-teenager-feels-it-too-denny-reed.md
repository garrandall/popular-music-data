Do you think just because you're older
You're among the chosen few
Who can lean on somebody's shoulder
And be thrilled like you never knew
Well I've got news for you
A teenager feels it too
(A teenager feels it too)

When you're kissed by your one and only
And she swears that she'll be true
Then she leaves you alone and lonely
You don't have to be twenty-two
To really have the blues
A teenager feels it too
(A teenager feels it too)

My love and I are only sixteen
We wouldn't trade it for all the gold
So there is really no difference between
Love that is old or love in it's teens

So when we say that we're going steady
And you say it's puppy love
Could it be that you're forgetting
All the heartaches of your first love
Remember it's nothing new
A teenager feels it too
A teenager feels it too
A teenager feels it too
A teenager feels it too
