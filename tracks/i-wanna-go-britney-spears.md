Lately, I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out
Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it, when the light's out


Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably


I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind, woah
I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind, whoa


Lately, people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out
I've been told just what to do with it
To keep both my hands above the blanket, when the light's out


Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably


I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind, woah
I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind, whoa


Shame on me (Shame on me)
To need release (To need release)
Uncontrollably (Uncontrollably, -lably, -lably, -lably...)


I wanna go (I wanna go...) all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show (I wanna show...) all the dirt I got running through my mind
I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind, whoa
