You wanna dance?
Ha, I'ma make you dance
You wanna move?
Ha, I'ma make you move
Dru Hill come on


I got this feeling
I can't turn it loose
That somebody else is getting next to you
Can't walk around
Like I was your fool
Cause being who I am I can't lose my cool
My friends keep telling me bout things going on
But deep in my heart babe
I hope that I'm wrong


Somebody's sleepin' in my bed
Messin' with my head
Takin' my place
(Somebody's sleepin' in my bed)
Sleepin' in bed
Messin' with my head
Takin' my place
(Takin my place, Oh oh)

I come home early expecting your warm embrace
But something's wrong cause it's written on your face
(Written on your face)
Cause it hurts so bad when I walk through the door
But you know one thing
I ain't comin' back no more
Don't try to tell me things are still the same
Cause when we made love I heard you call out his name



What else did you want?
What else did you need?
Giving you everything plus my heart
I gave you the world (Yes I did)
Cause you were my girl (Oh yes I)
But you still ran out on me


Uh, fly shit, differnt colors whips
I got plenty big hits, all kinda dips
Got too many


My life ain't complete if I ain't got no buzz
And can't nobody do it like we does
It's a must brat bust and the mike you hand to me
And represent for the rest of the family


Well I'm known for makin' moves on my own big songs
And now I keep it commin' stong till the early morn


Lemme interrupt
Your regular schedule
Twistin' off high levels of bubonic
Chokin' amateurs till they vomit


I make em sick cause I'm the williest


Too much for you to deal with
My niggas that ride quick
Survive or die bitch


Why switch this remix hurts everyday
It's like this and I never stop puttin it in work
I rock from L.A. to Dru Hill
Something you can feel
All I'm about is that dolla dolla bill
What the deal?


Funkier than parliment
Stay bent behind tent
And keep a nigga payin' my rent
My goldier scent lingers
VVS describes best what's on the fingers


We make believers out of dreamers
