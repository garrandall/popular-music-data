Into my life you came
Spreading a glow, you shared my name
Baby, Lord knows I'm not ashamed
To tell the whole world I love you, yeah

Stretch out your hand and pick me up
Nourish me from the lovin' cup
With a love that filled me up
Till my cup runneth over

With your sweet-er, understanding love
Undemanding love
And it's sho nuff love, hey baby
Sweet-er and undying love
Undenying love
And it's sho nuff love, hey baby

Picked me up when they tore me down
Rescued me from the underground
Encircled me with your lovin' arms
And I'll always be thankful

Look at me, I'm a brand new man
With you a part of my master plan
Now I'm ready to take a stand
'Cause you made me a winner

With your sweet-er, understanding love
Undemanding love
Is sho nuff love, hey baby
Sweet-er and undying love
Undenying love
And it's sho nuff love, hey baby

L, L-O-V-E

L is for the new love you gave me
When I thought mine was through

O, L-O-V-E, love

O is for the only love I've ever known
Given to me by you

V, L-O-V-E, love

V is for the value
Of our priceless understanding

E, L-O-V-E, love

E is everlasting, girl

Sweet-er, understanding love
Undemanding love
And it's sho nuff love, hey baby
Sweet-er and undying love
Undenying love
And it's sho nuff love, hey baby

Sweet, understanding love
Undemanding love ...
