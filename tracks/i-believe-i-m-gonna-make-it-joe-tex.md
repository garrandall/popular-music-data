When I got your letter baby
I was in a foxhole on my knees
(Oh yes, I was)
And your letter brought me so much strength

Tell you what I did, baby
(Oh, you won't believe it)
I raised up and got me
Two mo' enemies
(Oh yes, I did)

Listen, that's why
I believe that I'm gonna make it
(Tell everybody back home)
I believe that I'm gonna make it
And baby, I'll be home before you can say
Jackie Robinson
(Oh yes, I will, yes, I will)

Sometimes I wonder
Do you really love me
Then I'll think of something sweet
You once said to me

And the thought makes me feel
So good inside
I raise up and get me
Two mo' enemies

Listen, baby
(Oh, oh baby)
I wished a thousand times
That we had gotten married
Before I left home for Vietnam

But then when I see so many of my buddies
Gettin' shot down all around me
Makes me kinda glad that we waited
Because I don't wanna leave you
At home being a widow, no
I know you understand, babe

Listen darling
They promised me a furlough
On the fifteenth of next month
And I want you to say a prayer tonight
That my furlough will come through

So I can come home to be with you
And tomorrow, oh tomorrow
Go by and tell my mom and daddy
That I love 'em
And for 'em not to worry about me

Listen
'Cause I believe that I'm gonna make it
Tell everybody back home
I believe that I'm gonna make it
And baby, I'll be home before you can say
Batman and Robin
