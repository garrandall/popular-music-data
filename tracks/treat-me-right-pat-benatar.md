You want me to leave
You want me to stay
You ask me to come back
You turn and walk away
You wanna be lovers
And you wanna be friends
I'm losing my patience
You're nearing the end
One of these days
You're gonna reach out and find
The one that you count on
Has left you behind
Don't want to be no martyr
With no one, no say
Oh my, my baby
Before it's too late

Treat me right
Treat me right
Open your eyes
Maybe you'll see the light

Do you think I'm a fool
Well you better think twice
I've had enough, baby
It's time you realized
That you can't have it both ways
It's no way to live
You've done all the takin'
It's your turn to give

One of these days
You're gonna reach out and find
The one that you count on
Has left you behind
Don't want to be no martyr
With no one, no say
Oh my, my baby
Before it's too late

Treat me right
Treat me right
Open your eye's
Maybe you'll see the light
Ooh-ooh
Treat me right



You want me to leave
You want me to stay
You ask me to come back
You're turnin' love away
You wanna be lovers
And you wanna be friends
I'm losing my patience
You're nearing the end

Treat me right
Treat me right
Open your eyes
Maybe you'll see the light
Ooh-ooh
Treat me right

Treat me right, treat me right
Treat me right, treat me right
Treat me right, treat me right
Treat me right, treat me right
Treat me right
