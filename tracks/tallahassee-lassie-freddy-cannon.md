Well, she comes from Tallahassee, whoa
She got a hi-fi chassis, whoa
Maybe looks a little sassy, whoa
But to me she's real classy, whoa
Yeah, my Tallahassee Lassie
Down in F-L-A

Well, she's rompin' to the drag
The cha-cha, rag-a-mop
Stompin' to the shag, whoa
Rocks the bunny hop

(Oo, oo)
(Oo, oo)

Well, she dances to the bop
She dances to the stroll
She dances to the walk, whoa
She can rock 'n' roll

She's my Tallahassee lassie, whoa
Yeah, my Tallahassee lassie, whoa
She's my Tallahassee lassie
Down in F-L-A

Well, she's rompin' to the drag
The cha-cha, rag-a-mop
Stompin' to the shag, whoa
Rocks the bunny hop

(Oo, oo)
(Oo, oo)

Well, she dances to the bop
She dances to the stroll
She dances to the walk, whoa
She can rock 'n' roll

She's my Tallahassee lassie, whoa
Yeah, my Tallahassee lassie, whoa
She's my Tallahassee lassie
Down in F-L-A

Come on, baby
Come on, honey
Yeah, come on, sugar
Come on, baby

Come on, baby
Come on, honey
Yeah, come on, sugar
Come on, baby

Come on, baby
Come on, honey
Yeah, come on, sugar
Come on, baby
