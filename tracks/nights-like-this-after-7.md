Shoo bee doop do do doo oo...
Shoo bee doop do do doo
Shoo bee doop do do doo oo...
Shoo bee doop do do doo

I could feel
That it was over
Your love for me
Diminished slowly
Why couldn't you tell me
You had a lover on your mind
It's no way to treat me
When you know how I feel inside

I could not hide the
Way I felt last night
Tears I cried
My love for you
I can't deny
No, no, no...

Nights like this I wish
That raindrops would fall
Yes, I do, yeah, yeah
Nights like this I wish
That raindrops would fall

Girl, I know
What's been going on
You got another lover
And you got it going strong
I been walking round town
With a smile on my face
Trying to fight the hurt
Trying to hide the shame, baby
I cannot cry no more
Now I realize I was too blind, baby
Being the fool in love
You know it ain't right, girl
If you really wanna
Be happy, baby

Nights like this I wish
That raindrops would fall
Oh, how I wish raindrops
Would fall on my face, baby
Nights like this I wish
That raindrops would fall
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Nights like this I wish (Rain, rain, rain, yeah)
That raindrops would fall (Rain down my face, baby)
Nights like this I wish
That raindrops would fall

Baby, yeah, yeah, yeah

Tears I've cried

I could feel when everything
Was not too real
Inside, I cried
To win your love
You know I tried

Nights like this I wish (Come on, come on)
That raindrops would fall (Keep rain falling down On my face, baby)
Nights like this I wish
That raindrops would fall (Come on, come on, yeah)

Nights like this I wish
That raindrops would fall
(Let then fall, baby)
Nights like this I wish
That raindrops would fall...
