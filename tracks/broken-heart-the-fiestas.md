My deja vu
Like so many nights before
We're so wavy on the floor, gentle dancing
Maybe feel a little fancy, deja vu
Deja vu
Alors alors
Broken hearts and sweet liqueur
Where did you go, my karaoke seÃ±orita
With the frozen margarita, deja vu
Deja vu

Blue eve on my Vespa
Take me to local cities
Take me to local fiesta
I know it's a fine line but
I'm on vacay on a half time 'cause
I need the space to get over you
Blue nights on my Vespa
Take me to local cities
Take me to local fiesta
I know it's a fine line but
I'm on vacay on a half time plus
I need the space to get over you

My deja vu
Like so many nights before
We're so wavy on the floor, gentle dancing
Maybe feel a little fancy, deja vu
Deja vu
Alors alors
Broken hearts and sweet liqueur
Where did you go, my karaoke seÃ±orita
With the frozen margarita, deja vu
Deja vu

Cold breeze by the ocean
Radio gives me a feelin'
Radio give me emotions playin'
ClichÃ©s from the 80s and
All it does is remind me that
I need the space to get over you

My deja vu
Like so many nights before
We're so wavy on the floor, gentle dancing
Maybe feel a little fancy, deja vu
Deja vu
Alors alors
Broken hearts and sweet liqueur
Where did you go, my karaoke seÃ±orita
With the frozen margarita, deja vu
Deja vu
