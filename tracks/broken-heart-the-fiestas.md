Don't build your hopes too high
Don't fall for the look in her eye
Don't wish on a twinklin' star
Don't let it go too far

She'll love you
She'll leave you
With a broken heart
With a broken heart

Just let her tell you things she'll do
Just let her make a promise to you
Just let her tell you all those lies
Just remember there will be goodbyes

She'll love you
She'll leave you
With a broken heart
With a broken heart

She'll tell you she loves you
She told me that before
She'll tell you she wants you
Then she'll walk out the door

She'll go off with somebody new
She'll do them like she did you
She'll forget she ever knew your name
She'll make you think that you're to blame

She'll love you
She'll leave you
With a broken heart
With a broken heart

She'll tell you she loves you
She told me that before
She'll tell you she wants you
Then she'll walk out the door

She'll go off with somebody new
She'll do them like she did you
She'll forget she ever knew your name
She'll make you think that you're to blame

She'll love you
She'll leave you
With a broken heart
With a broken heart
