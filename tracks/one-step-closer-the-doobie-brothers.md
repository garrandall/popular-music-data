Baby, there's a chance you ought to take
Chance of a mistake you gotta make
Maybe I'm mistaken too
To take my chance with you
I need you like a shadow needs a light
I'll follow you like morning follows night
When nothin's left ahead of you
I'll be right behind you
Shadows disappear at night
We both know it's a shame if you should lose one
Why is it so hard to find
Tell me that you're right there too
One step baby
Two steps maybe
One step closer
I'll be next to you

Baby, it's a secret I can't keep
Trouble comes and suddenly you're weak
I don't believe you got the strength
To fight this kind of love
I know it's risky now and then
What with all the what ifs and the whens
Who is there to say we're wrong - to tell us it can't be
Come on, baby, please don't go
I'm no heart of stone and you know
Why is it so hard to do
Tell me that you're right there too, baby

Baby, can't you see we're runnin' late
Can't you see we ain't got time to wait
Might be that you're scared of me
Of something you might feel
Hold on to me, baby, hold on tight
I can take us through the night all right
Maybe I will stay here too
Take my chance with you

Shadows disappear at night
We both know it's a shame if you should lose one
Why is it so hard to find
Tell me that you're right there too

One step baby
Two steps maybe
One step closer
