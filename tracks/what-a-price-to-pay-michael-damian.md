Makin' love to you
Wasn't the right thing to do
What a price to pay
For the friend I could lose

Did you think you were misled
By the words you thought I said
When you know that I never meant to harm you

I could never be
What you want me to be
What a price to pay
To lose a friend this way

Did you think you were misled
By the words you thought I said
I never meant to harm you
What a price it is...
... To pay

Gotta know?
The way the sun shines on your hair
I wanna be a part of you
But I can't change what isn't there

Baby don't push it, don't force it
Don't make me have to choose
Either way you know I'm gonna lose

No, I could never be
What you want me to be
What a price to pay
To lose a friend this way

Did you think you were misled
By the words you thought I said
I never meant to harm you
What a price it is...
... To pay



I tell you somethin'
I tell you somethin'
I'm still in love with you
After all that we've been through
I think we can make it
I know I can make it to you

I can never be
What you want me to be
What a price to pay
To lose a friend this way

Did you think you were misled
By the words you thought I said
I never meant to harm you
What a price it is...

I can never be
What you want me to be
What a price to pay
To lose a friend this way

Did you think you were misled
By the words you thought I said
I never meant to harm you
What a price it is...

I can never be
What you want me to be
What a price to pay
To lose a friend this way

Did you think you were misled
By the words you thought I said
I never meant to harm you
What a price it is...
No...
