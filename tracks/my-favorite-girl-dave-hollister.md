I'd like to dedicate this ring
To my favorite girl
I know I haven't been the most perfect man ever
But I love you
God knows I do


Ohh yeah
Why... why
Ummmmm
What's wrong with your shady ***
Waking me up early in the mornin' still yawning
Don't you know a ***** half sleep
So why the hell you keep on paging me
I told you once before
I'm gon' say it once again don't you call no more
My girl is lying next to me
Do you think this is a game whay you testing me
You keep on stressing me


Can't keep callin' me
All night long just constantly
Interuppting can't you see
I'm with my favorite girl
What's that **** you on
Talkin' 'bout my baby's mom
When she's here laying in my arms
She is my favorite girl


I saw you round my way
Riding by my crib just the other day
The order of protection was restraining me
I couldn't take the chance of someone naming me
You tryina frame me
Leave my alone
Callin' me and hangin' up cause wifey's home
How d'you get my number in the first place
Cause the **** ain't even listed under my name


You call me
And your tellin' me
That you wantin'me
And you needin' me
Cause you lonely
And you can't see
How I could be with another three
At tch and and that she
Could never be my wifey
Why can't you see it wasn't meant for you and me
(you're so damn crazy girl)
Your crazy
If you thinkin I'll never need my baby
My lady
My only one
Who was ther for me
Who cares for me
My destiny who
Knows the thing's
That's best for me
But you can't see
It's ecstasy
What will only mean the world to me




Ohhh
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Gotta go
Stop callin' me!
Why don't you
(why don't you just leave me alone)
Let me be
... I can't take no more
No
Think I need alittle help
Stevie j play it for me



Ohhhhh
You can't keep callin' me
