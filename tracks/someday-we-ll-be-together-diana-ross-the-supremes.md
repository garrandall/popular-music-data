I say, say, say it again
(Someday, we'll be together)
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
You're far away from me, my love

And just as sure my, my, baby
As there are stars above
I wanna say, wanna say, wanna say
(Someday, we'll be together)

Yes we will, yes we will
(Say, someday, we'll be together)
Some sweet day
I know, I know, I know, I know
My love is yours, baby

Oh, right from the start
You, you, you possess my soul now, honey
And I know, I know you own my heart
And I wanna say
(Oh, someday, we'll be together)

Some sweet day
Oh, yes we will, yes we will
(Someday, we'll be together)
Tell everybody, yes we will, yes we will
Long time ago, my, my sweet thing

I made a big mistake, honey
I, I, I say, I said, goodbye
Oh, oh, baby, ever, ever, ever
Ever, ever and ever since that day
All I wanna do, all I wanna do was cry, cry, oh
Hey, hey, hey

I long for you every, every night
Oh, just to kiss your sweet, sweet lips, baby
Hold you ever, ever so tight
And I wanna say
Someday we'll be together
Yes we will, yes we will
Someday we'll be together
Yes we will, yes we will
Someday we'll be together
Someday we'll be together
Yes we will, yes we will
