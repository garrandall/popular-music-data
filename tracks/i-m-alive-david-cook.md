Here in this crowd I'm feeling all alone
Turn me around and point me back to home
I'm getting lost more everyday
And I can't tear myself away
From the stars in my eyes with no light
Here are my terms, have some faith in me
And I'll let you be who you need to be


Life on the moon couldn't be any stranger
Life on the moon wouldn't feel this far away?
The life that I knew is trough
And I'm gonna need you more than ever
I'm alone in this crowded room
Its like life on the moon

Flown off the ground my head's up in the air
Self counscious to a fault with all the pople everywhere
Is getting harder everynight to take the punches left and right
Just to know that you're here by my side
Here are my terms have some faith in me
And I'll let you be who you need to be


Life on the moon couldn't be any stranger
Life on the moon wouldn't feel this far away
The life that I knew is through
And im gonna need you more than ever
Im alone in this crowded room
Its like life on the moon

Getting lost in my own atmosphere
Stars in the sky are the stars in my eyes
Is the cost of getting out of here alive


Life on the moon couldn't be any stranger
Life on the moon wouldn't feel this far way
The life that I knew is through 
And im gonna need you more than ever
Im alone in this crowded room
Life on the moon
Life on the moon
The life that I know is through
And im gonna need you more than ever
Im alone in this crowded room
Its like life on the moon
Life on the moon
