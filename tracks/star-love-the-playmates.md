Bright stars, Venus and Mars and Jupiter too
Bright stars, Venus and Mars and Jupiter too
(Bright stars, Venus and Mars and Jupiter too)
(Bright stars, Venus and Mars)

Star love, that's what we call our love
Bright as the light that shines on a night like this
(Bright stars, Venus and Mars and Jupiter too)

Star dreams, that's what we call our dreams
Born of surrender, warm and so tender kiss
(Bright stars, Venus and Mars)

The first week we met was our lucky seven
How can I forget, I'm still in heaven
Heavenly star love, if you should stray far love
I'd glide to a star to be where you are, star love
(Bright stars, Venus and Mars and Jupiter too)
(Bright stars, Venus and Mars)

The first week we met was our lucky seven
How can I forget, I'm still in heaven
Heavenly star love, if you should stray far love
I'd glide to a star to be where you are
I'd glide to a star to be where you are
I'd glide to a star to be where you are, star love
(Bright stars, Venus and Mars)
And Jupiter too
Bright stars, Venus and Mars and Jupiter too
Bright stars, Venus and Mars...
