Hey, Stephen,
I know looks can be deceiving,
But I know I saw a light in you.
And as we walked
We were talking.
I didn't say half the things I wanted to.

Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold.
Hey, Stephen,
Boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone.

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel,
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.
So, come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.
Can't help it if there's no one else.
I can't help myself.

Hey, Stephen,
I've been holding back this feeling.
So, I got some things to say to you, ha.
I seen it allâ
So I thoughtâ
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do.

The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my nameâ
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change.
Hey, Stephen,
Why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same.

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel,
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.
So, come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.
Can't help it if there's no one else.
I can't help myself.

They're dimming the street lights.
You're perfect for me. Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so, come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine.

Hey, Stephen,
I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose.
All those other girlsâ
Well, they're beautiful,
But would they write a song for you?

I can't help it if you look like an angel,
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.
So, come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.
Can't help it if there's no one else.
I can't help myself...

...if you look like an angel.
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.
So, come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.
Can't help it if there's no one else.
I can't help myself.

Myself.
Can't help myself.
I can't help myself.
