Honey, when we're together
It seems like we both got
A whole lot of nothing to say

But I know if we try
We can work it out someday
Good Lord, I know if we try
We can work it out someday

(CHORUS)
Cause I believe
If there's a will
Sure enough, honey
There's a way
If there's a will, yeah, yeah
Sure enough, honey
There's a way, oh, lord

There ain't no need to worry
Cause nothing's wrong
It just ain't the time
Or place, no, no

And you can believe
Nearly every word I say
Oh, yeah, you can believe
Nearly every word I say

(CHORUS)

Got to get a thing together
Little less talking
We have lots more to say

When we're alone
It's gonna happen anyway
When we're alone
It's gonna happen anyway

(CHORUS) 3X
