I see main street closing
Miles of âFor Saleâ signs
And them fields ainât growing
Fast enough to get us by
I feel the sweet release,
Of a Friday night
For a couple of hours we can run this town
Till it runs dry

Tip it on back, make it feel good
Sip a little more than you know you should
Let the smoke roll, off your lips
Let it all go whatever it is
And tip it on back

So grab the girl you came with
And set her world on fire
And watch her sway and singing to the music
Until itâs all alright
Yeah

Tip it on back, make it feel good
Sip a little more than you know you should
Let the smoke roll, off your lips
Let it all go whatever it is
And tip it on back

I donât wanna lose this feeling
And I donât wanna close my eyes
I donât wanna remember what Iâm here to forget tonight
So tip it on back

Tip it on back, make it feel good
Sip a little more than you know you should
Let the smoke roll, off your lips
Let it all go whatever it is
And tip it on back
Tip it on back

Yeah, I donât wanna lose this feeling
I donât wanna close my eyes
I donât wanna remember what Iâm here to forget tonight
So tip it on back
Just tip it on back

Feel the sweet release of a Friday night
For a couple of hours we can run this town
Till it runs dry
Tip it on back
