Hey, Mr. Limousine Driver
Can I ask you a favor, please?
Let her in my door and don't look back here no more
I know you can do it with ease

Although we're on our way from the show
And you don't like to get off the track
Please, Mr. Chauffeur, let's talk things over
'Cause she says she loves me and that's a fact

Can you hear what I'm sayin'? It's not like I'm prayin'
You know because you've done it before
So, why make me wait, please don't hesitate
Just get back here and let her in my door

Hey, Mr. Limousine Driver
I know you know where it's at
Too late will be later, you just read your evening paper
And don't worry 'bout what's goin' on in back

Hey, Mr. Limousine Driver
Hey, Mr. Limousine Driver
