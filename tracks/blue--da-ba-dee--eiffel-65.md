Yo listen up here's a story
About a little guy that lives in a blue world
And all day and all night and everything he sees
Is just blue like him inside and outside

Blue his house with a blue little window
And a blue Corvette and everything is blue for him
And himself and everybody around
'Cause he ain't got nobody to listen to

I'm blue da ba dee da ba die

I have a blue house with a blue window
Blue is the colour of all that I wear
Blue are the streets and all the trees are too
I have a girlfriend and she is so blue

Blue are the people here that walk around
Blue like my Corvette, it's in and outside
Blue are the words I say and what I think
Blue are the feelings that live inside me

I'm blue da ba dee da ba die

I have a blue house with a blue window
Blue is the colour of all that I wear
Blue are the streets and all the trees are too
I have a girlfriend and she is so blue

Blue are the people here that walk around
Blue like my Corvette, it's in and outside
Blue are the words I say and what I think
Blue are the feelings that live inside me

I'm blue da ba dee da ba die

Inside and outside
Blue his house with the blue little window
And a blue Corvette and everything is blue for him
And himself and everybody around
'Cause he ain't got nobody to listen to

I'm blue da ba dee da ba die

I'm blue (da ba dee da ba die)
