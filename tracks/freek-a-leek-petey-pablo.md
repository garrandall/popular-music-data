Twenty-four, thirty-four, forty-six
Good and thick and what you give her she'll work wit' it (she'll work wit' it)
Pretty face and some cute lips
Earing in her tongue and she know what to do with it (she know what to do wit' it)
Made a name for herself and she do her shit well and know how
To keep her business to herself
Come over anytime nigga call check
1 o'clock, 2 o'clock (ding dong) and she right there
And she know why she came here
And she know where clothes suppose to be (off and over there)
Sniff a lil' coke, take a lil' x, smoke a lil' weed, drink a lil' bit
I need a girl I could freak wit' (freak wit')
And wanna try shit and ain't scared of a big dick (big dick)
And love to get her pussy licked by another bitch
Cause I ain't drunk enough to do that shit

I need to know a whole lot
That could teach me broad
Need a ding dong stick a tongue and take her to ball
I had to gon' head do that for her
I'm spoiled (and I don't like to work that hard)
I like to lay back relax and enjoy my turn
Let my eyes roll back and my toes curl (I love when you do that girl)
Til it come time for me to have to give her hers
Tell me what you want
Do you want it missionary with your feet crammed to the headboard
Do you want it from the back with your face
In the pillow so you could yell as loud as you want to
Do you want it on the floor, do you want it on the chair
Do you want it over here, do you want it over there
Do you want it in your pussy, do you want it in your ass
I could give you (anything you can handle)

Double-U boom boom beat
The radio station that plays all the new hip hop and R&B
That was the new "Freek-A-Leek" by Petey Pablo
Something to put a little razzle to your dazzle
A little pimp in your step
We gonna keep it going and we're gonna play another one of the songs off of the album
This one right here, one of my personal favorites
Featuring Young Buck from G-G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit!
