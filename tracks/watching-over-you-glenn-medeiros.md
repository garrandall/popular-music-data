Now that you're far away
I can see everything so clear
Now that you're really gone
I can feel you
Like you´re standing here

And if I had another chance to say goodbye
I would just say thank you
For the times we spent
And not to cry
Cause I'm...


Still watching over you
Though we´re far apart
You´ll never really be
So far from my heart

I´m watching over you
I´ve looked inside my dreams
And everything
I see you watching over me


How can we lose our way
If we just let ourselves be led
And maybe it hurts today
But tomorrow we´ll come out ahead

I don´t want to lose you
So I´ll let you go
And if it ends up
We are meant to met again
We'll let each other know
Cause I'm...




I don´t want to lose you
So I'll let you go
And if it ends up
We are meant to meet again
We'll let each other know
