Listen, dear
I need you to hear
I cannot disappear
I've tried again and again and again and again
I know we said
That we'd give up
You said we'd had enough
Again and again and again and again


But you, you're always on my mind
It's like this all the time
Say it's cause you're mine, all mine


And if you will, I will
Try to let it go
And if you try, I'll try
Try to let it show us the way
'Cause love is here to stay
Just look me in the eye
This is do or die
I will not say enough
'Til you say enough
There is no giving in
There is no giving up in love


Walk down the street
Stare at lots of things
The passing steady streams
Again and again and again and again
Do what I should
Try to stay busy
Your face is all I see
Again and again and again and again


But you, you're always on my mind
It's like this all the time
Say it's cause you're mine, all mine


And if you will, I will
Try to let it go
And if you try, I'll try
Try to let it show us the way
'Cause love is here to stay
Just look me in the eye
This is do or die
I will not say enough
'Til you say enough
There is no giving in
There is no giving up in love
Oh, oh, oh


Like a movie I once saw
In the darkness I recall
Feeling the beauty and the pain
And when you call my name
Say you feel the same


'Cause if you will, I will
Try to let it go
And if you try, I'll try
Try to let it show


And if you will, I will
Try to let it go
And if you try, I'll try
Try to let it show us the way
'Cause love is here to stay
Just look me in the eye
This is do or die
I will not say enough
'Til you say enough
There is no giving in
There is no giving up in love
In love, in love
We're in love


I cannot disappear
I've tried again and again and again and again
