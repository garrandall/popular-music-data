I long for
The warmth of
Days gone by
When you were mine
But now those days are memories in time
Life's empty
Without you
By my side
My heart belongs to you
No matter what I try


When I get the courage up to love somebody new
It always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you
Your love won't release me, I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change


In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean
Where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves
The trees are bare when you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
(It doesn't feel the same, oh)


Remember
The nights when (remember the night)
We closed our eyes (when we closed our eyes)
And vowed that you and I
Would be in love for all time


Everytime I think about these things I shared with you
I break down and cry 'cause I get so emotional
Until you release me I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change


In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here
It doesn't feel the same


This loneliness has crushed my heart (it's killing me, baby)
Please let me love again (I just wanna know if I can fix this)


'Cause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain
Or four seasons will bring the loneliness again


In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
(It doesn't feel the same)


Remember
The warmth of
Days gone by
