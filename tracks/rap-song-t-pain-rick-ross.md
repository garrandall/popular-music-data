Everybody say yeaaaah
Oh oh oh...

We been messinâ round for a long (long time)
A while now (while now, uh)
And you already know whatâs on my mind (mind)
Itâs goinâ down now (itâs goinâ down now?)
And I donât need no background music, girl
I turn it loud now
I got the gangsta feelinâ
And Iâma do somethinâ to you
To you, to you
Oh
We can take it over The Bay
Where my Mistah F.A.B. at? (F.A.B. at, uh)
Or just put on that N.W.A.
Cominâ Straight Outta Compton on that pussy, baby
And we can all night long (haha)
Iâm bout to have yoâ head gone
And I ainât doinâ nothinâ wrong
But we can make love to a rap song


Me and you, yoâ mama and yoâ cousin
Baby we can make love to a rap song
A milli, a milli, a milli, a-muthafucka Iâm ill
Baby we can make love to a rap song
Go shawty (uh) itâs ya birthday (uh)
We gonâ party like itâs ya birthday

And you been on my mind all day (all day)
I know you wit it (know you wit it baby, uh)
And Iâma do you like Kanye (yeah) cuz Iâma let you finish (let you finish!)
You can get it (you can get it)
Or we can do it east coast style and Iâll keep on my fitted
I said I got the gangsta feelinâ
I feel like breakinâ you off
You off, you off
Off
We can take it way down south
Rick Ross on the iPad (cuz you the bossâ girl)
Super-thick thighs and ya booty like Bombs Over Baghdad (BOOM!)
Wait, hold up
She got a donk (YUP!) she got a donk (YUP!), she got a donk
Iâm bout to have yoâ head gone
And I ainât doinâ nothinâ wrong
But we can make love to a rap song


Me and you, yoâ mama and yoâ cousin
Baby we can make love to a rap song
A milli, a milli, a milli, a-muthafucka Iâm ill
Baby we can make love to a rap song
Go shawty (uh) itâs ya birthday (uh)
We gonâ party like itâs ya birthday

Or do you like a Juvie, make ya back it all up (uh)

Blow a couple racks in Barneyâs on that Phillip Lim

Haters do they thing, but we do it bigger
