Want some whiskey in your water?
Sugar in your tea?
What's all these crazy questions they're askin me?
This is the craziest party that could ever be
Don't turn on the lights cause I don't wanna see

Mama told me not to come
Mama told me not to come
That ain't the way to have fun, no

Open up the window, let some air into this room
I think I'm almost chokin from the smell of stale perfume
And that cigarette you're smokin bout scare me half to death
Open up the window, sucker, let me catch my breath

Mama told me not to come
Mama told me not to come
That ain't the way to have fun, son
That ain't the way to have fun, son

The radio is blastin, someones knockin at the door
I'm lookin at my girlfriend - she's passed out on the floor
I seen so many things I ain't never seen before
Don't know what it is - I don't wanna see no more

Mama told me not to come
Mama told me not to come
She said, That ain't the way to have fun, son
That ain't the way to have fun, no

That ain't the way to have fun, no
That ain't the way to have fun, son
That ain't the way to have fun, no
That ain't the way to have fun, son

That ain't the way to have fun, no
That ain't the way to have fun, son
That ain't the way to have fun, no
That ain't the way to have fun, son
