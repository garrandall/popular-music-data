Frustration (watching you dance)
Hesitation (to get in them pants)
Come closer baby (so I can touch)
One question: Am I moving too fast?


'Cause I ain't leaving alone
Feel like I could be honest babe
We both know that we're grown
That's why I wanna know


How many drinks would it take you to leave with me?
Yeah you look good, and I got money
But I don't wanna waste my time
Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three
You look good; we came to party
But I don't wanna waste my time


Temptation (is calling your name)
Sweet persuasion, oh (baby this is a game)
Come closer baby (if you like what you hear)
Impassioned (is what I'm making you feel)


'Cause I ain't leaving you alone
Feel like I could be honest babe
We both know that we're grown
That's why I wanna know


How many drinks would it take you to leave with me?
Yeah you look good, and I got money
But I don't wanna waste my time
Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three
You look good; we came to party
But I don't wanna waste my time, waste my time


No-no-no. I ain't judging
If you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight
What? More power to you
If you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight
Le-le-let me dig that out like a fossil
Damn baby, that ass is colossal
Pilates and milk did that body so good
You got in them pants? I wish I could
How many drinks would it take you to leave with me? (oh, well...)
You look good, and we came to party
But I don't wanna waste my time (oh no)
Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three
Agree? Indeed
You look good, and we came to party
But I don't wanna waste my time


Or waste your time, or waste your time
Or waste our time, baby it's alright
Baby it's alright, baby it's alright yeah
Oh it's alright now
Alright, oh yeah
I don't wanna waste my time, no
I don't wanna waste no time, oh no
I don't wanna waste your time, babe
I don't wanna waste our time, oh my time, oh whoa, now


How many drinks would it take you to leave with me? (oh yeah)
Yeah you look good, and I got money
But I don't wanna waste my time (come wit' me baby)
Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three (yeah it's just a short drive home from here)
You look good; we came to party
But I don't wanna waste my time (waste my time)


No-no-no, I ain't judgin'
If you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight
What? More power to you
If you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight
I ain't judgin'
If you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight
What? More power to you
If you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight


Let's go, shit we only live once right?
I mean, where's the fun in forever anyway?
