Yeah
Lady got a man, but her man donât know
Get down, get drunk let it get low
Give me the chance and Iâma slide on through
Three point stance girl get a little room
12 gauge hit with a slap jack bite
Make them boys in the club get right
Man on the phone tell her I said hi
Jeans so tight woman ainât no lie
So pour me a shot and let me get one more
And get your little pretty ass back on the floor
Making an olâ country boy say oh, oh, oh, oh

You know you got it baby
That country walk you do
You know you drive me crazy
That country walk you do (Lookinâ for a country girl)
You know you got it baby (Lookinâ for a country girl)
That country walk you do (Lookinâ for a country girl)
You know you drive me crazy (Lookinâ for a country girl)
That country walk you do

No hotel no motel in the back of a field
A little Conway Twitty and the seat laid back
And I know she know the deal
Got a sexy little body and it move
Ainât no need in actinâ shy
My little di-di-di-di-dixie girl love to shake hers all the time
No hotel no motel in the back of a field
A little Conway Twitty and the seat laid back
And I know she know the deal

You know you got it baby
That country walk you do
You know you drive me crazy
That country walk you do (Lookinâ for a country girl)
You know you got it baby (Lookinâ for a country girl)
That country walk you do (Lookinâ for a country girl)
You know you drive me crazy (Lookinâ for a country girl)
That country walk you do

Now heel to toe, dosy-do
Baby let me see that dance
I saw you from across the room
And I think I got a chance
Let me buy you a drank, sang you a song
Cuz you sure are fine
And if you wanna go back to my world baby
Just hop in the 4 wheel drive

Good lawdy go-go-good lawdy
Look at that broad in them shorty-shorts
Everybody in the place get off the wall
Watch a little country girl shake-sh-shake it all
In a little bitty faded jean skirt
Short John Deere green t-shirt
Up to her knees in her cowboy boots
Getting down on the floor where she letting loose
And the little country girl said her name was Trixie
Say she got a man, well how bad is he
Says that she love it when Iâm whistling Dixie

You know you got it baby
That country walk you do
You know you drive me crazy
That country walk you do (Lookinâ for a country girl)
You know you got it baby (Lookinâ for a country girl)
That country walk you do (Lookinâ for a country girl)
You know you drive me crazy (Lookinâ for a country girl)
That country walk you do

You know you got it baby
That country walk you do
You know you drive me crazy
That country walk you do (Lookinâ for a country girl)
You know you got it baby (Lookinâ for a country girl)
That country walk you do (Lookinâ for a country girl)
You know you drive me crazy (Lookinâ for a country girl)
That country walk you do
Ha
