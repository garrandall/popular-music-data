I've got a gal who treats me right
Plenty good loving every night
There just ain't nothing
That she don't know
I guess that's why I love her so

I'd do anything she wants me to
I lnow that her love for me is true
Why do I love this gal of mine
Because she's, mmm, so fine

(She's mine) well, I like
The way she walks (she's mine)
I like the way she talks
(She's mine) and I'm her loving man
She stole my heart when she held my hand

We talked it over and we set the date
I can hardly wait
My dear little daisy's mine, all mine
My gal is, mmm, so fine

(She's mine) yes, I like
The way she walks (she's mine)
I like the way she talks
(She's mine) well, I'm her loving man
She stole my heart when she held my hand

We talked it over and we set the date
I can hardly wait
My dear little daisy's mine, all mine
My gal is, mmm, so fine

(She's mine)
Yeah, she's really fine (she's mine)
Whoa, she's mine, all mine (she's mine)
My gal's so doggone fine (she's mine)
Yeah, I love her all the time (she's mine)
