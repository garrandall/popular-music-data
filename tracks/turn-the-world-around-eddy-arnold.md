Turn the world around the other way
Back it up and stop on yesterday
Back to before that silly fight
And give me a chance to make things right

I said some things I didn't mean to say
Things that I am sorry for today
Down on my knees I beg you please
To turn the world around the other way

I never really wanted us to break up
And I'm sorry for each teardrop that you cried
We need to give our hearts a chance to make up
And darling will you stand in by my side?

We'll turn the world around the other way
Back to where it started yesterday
Just take my hand together we can turn
The world around the other way

Yes, we'll turn the world around the other way
Back to where it started yesterday
Just take my hand together we can turn
The world around the other way...
