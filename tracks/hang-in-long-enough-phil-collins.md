The signs are getting clearer, clearer than you need
The writing's on the wall, for you to see

You never thought you'd ever get the taste
You never thought that it could be this good
Just tell me what you want and I'll find the key
Reach out and touch it's all yours.

If you hang in long enough, you'll do it
Just hang in long enough

You're down on the ground, or so you say
You'd sell the hole in your pocket, if you could find a way
Don't ask me how I know, you don't wanna hear
It's been a long hard road, and the end is getting near.

You never thought you'd ever get the chance
You never thought your break would come along
If you tell me what you want, I'll find the key
Just reach out and touch it's all yours

If you hang in...

They always say
The best things in life are free
But you want to have everything 
Well you're going to have to beg if you want it all.

So hang in long enough, you'll do it
Hang in long enough

They'll let you out, then pull you in
Playing hell with your emotions,
You'll feel like giving in.

So just hang in long enough...
