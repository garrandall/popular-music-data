He needs me more than you do
And I know that he loves me
You never have
To you I am only a play thing
Just a toy that you found
You just keep around
Let me go to him
Let me be the woman I can be
If you set me free
Let me go to him
I can't live without his love
So I'm beggin' you to let me go to him
Let me go to him

Face the truth
You just don't care
When I try to work things out
You're never there
And lately we're never together
Half the time you don't call
That's no life at all
