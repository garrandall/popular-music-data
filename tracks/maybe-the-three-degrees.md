You know girls:
It's hard to find a guy that really blows your mind
And you just dig everything about him
And when you mess up your good thing
You feel like you wanna die
I know because I messed up mine

You know girls:
Sometimes we can say some pretty dumb things
I told the nicest guy in the world to get lost
"I don't need you"
But he was cool...
How do you just forget something that's a part of you

And then one evening I was standing at the bus stop
And I heard a voice behind me say:
"Hi baby"
Oh I just fell apart inside
Because I hadn't heard that voice in such a long time
I turned aroud and there he was
Aww he was looking so good
I couldn't help but wonder if the flame was still there
But I knew I had to find out and it had to be now
So I took his hand and I looked into his eyes and I said
I Said:

Maybe if I prayed every night (on my knees)
You'll come home to me (home home)
And baby maybe if I cry every day
You'll come back, you'll come back to stay
Maybe (maybe maybe baby)

Oh, oh maybe if I could hold your hand (maybe)
You'd understand (maybe maybe baby)
Maybe maybe maybe
Maybe if I just kissed your sweet lips
You'll be at my command
Maybe (maybe maybe baby)
Oh, oh, Maybe (maybe maybe baby)
Yeah Maybe (maybe maybe baby)
