If I was a carpenter 
And you were a lady 
Would you marry me anyway? 
Would you have my baby? 

If a tinker was my trade 
Would you tinker with me? 
Would you keep the vows we made 
Followin' behind me? 

And if I was Jesus 
And I built some crosses 
Could you see the future? 
Could stand the losses 
Of lovin' a carpenter 
And being a lady 
And takin' a chance on me 
Just to be my baby? 

Save my love through loneliness 
Save my love through sorrow, yes 
I'll give you my onliness 
If you just give me tomorrow, yeah

If I was a rock star 
Would you be my groupie? 
Would you make sweet love to me? 
Come to California? 

Well, I might go crazy 
I have to warn you 
Well, I get so mean sometimes 
When the spirit's on me 

That I think I'm Jesus 
Out buildin' crosses 
Could you see the future? 
Could you stand the losses? 
Of lovin' a carpenter 
And being a lady 
And takin' a chance on me 
Just to be my baby? 

Save my love through loneliness 
Save my love through sorrow, yeah 
I'll give you my onliness 
If you'd only give me tomorrow, yeah

If I was a carpenter 
And you were a lady 
Would you marry me anyway? 
Would you have my baby?

If a tinker was my trade 
Would you still love me? 
Would you keep the vows we made 
Followin' behind me?

And if I was Jesus 
And I built some crosses 
Could you see the future? 
Could stand the losses

Of lovin' a carpenter 
And being a lady? 
Would you take a chance on me? 
Would you be my baby? 

Come take a chance on me 
Won't you come away with me 
Come take a chance on me 
Won't you be my baby? 

Won't you take a chance on me? 
Won't you be my baby? 
Won't you take a chance on me? 
Won't you be my...
