I've been your lover
You've been my friend
Love and a friend's all you need in the end
We'll keep on growing
And ever we'll be
A friend and a love, indivisible

Loving
The seed we're sowing
Gonna keep it growing
As long as we can

Sometimes a sunshine day
Sometimes we're rain
Sunshine and rain keeps the fields ever green you know
It'll keep our love growing
Sure as a spring
The rain and the sun's indivisible
The sunshine and rain indivisible

Growing
The seed we're sowing
Gonna keep it growing
As long as we can
Uh mama
Growing
The seed we're sowing
Gonna keep it right on growing
As long as we can

Growing
The seed we're sowing
Gonna keep it growing
As long as we can
Oh growing
The seed we're sowing
Gonna keep it on growing
As long as we can
Gonna keep it on growing
As long as we can
