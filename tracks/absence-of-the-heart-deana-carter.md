I write you letters but I don't send them
I just can't figure out how to end them
I try to reach you you're right beside me
There's something missing and we can't deny that

We live together separately
We don't wanna fall apart
But every time we kiss
There's an emptiness
An absence of the heart

How did we lose it? Why did this happen?
When did we take it all for granted?
We sit in silence inside we're crying
How can we keep our love from dying?

We live together separately
We don't wanna fall apart
But every time we kiss 
There's an emptiness
An absence of the heart

We live together separately
We don't wanna fall apart
But every time we kiss 
There's an emptiness
An absence of the heart

We live together separately
We don't wanna fall apart
But every time we kiss 
There's an emptiness
An absence of the heart

I write you letters but I don't send them
