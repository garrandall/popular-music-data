A lonesome fear
A hungry face
A barren pain
A dream unchased
Oh I can't wait until the day there's sunshine in their eyes

A prayer is heard
By one so small
Let love be in the
Hearts of all
Oh I can't wait until there's sunshine in their eyes

You and I may never see them cry
Or wonder why the world's so cold
You feel that they're too young
To take a look around
But in their faces I can see the trouble all around

Today we must turn into lies
The truth already in their minds
Oh I can't wait until the day there's sunshine in their eyes

He can't wait until the day there's sunshine in their eyes
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO sunshine
Oh I can't wait until the day there's sunshine in their eyes
Sunshine in our eyes

Oh my momma's worried cause she feels the world is ending
She believes that everything is coming to an end
Papa's stayin real careful cause his brother Sam was robbed
Trying to buy just a loaf of bread for baby John

See how the world escaped
All the streets turin bare
Most of the news is bad
Crime just feeds in the air

Sad is the song
Rolling along
Everything is happening

Wit is the tune
Are we all doomed?
Everything is happening

Cost of livin's up, but the pay is low and down
Hate to see the babies starve cause momma cant be found
Sister lives alone, bolts and chains the door at night
Never ever walks an alley or a shorter way

See how the world escaped
All the streets turin bare
Most of the news is bad
Crime just feeds in the air

Sad is the song
Rolling along
Everything is happening

Wit is the tune
Are we all doomed?
Everything is happening

Father Bills gone fighting in a place where he's a stranger
But could men die a stranger in every war
We all hide in shame bolding pointing to another
When the blame we know for sure is right in ourselves, in ourselves, in ourselves, in ourselves, in ourselves

Sad is the song
Rolling along
Everything is happening

Wit is the tune
Are we all doomed?
Everything is happening

la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la
yeah yeah yeah
la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la
everybody say it now
