I met a fan dancer 
Down in Southside Birmingham 
She was running from a fat man 
Selling salvation in his hand 

Now he's trying to save me 
When I'm doing all right
The best that I can 

Just another fallen angel 
Trying to get through the night

Step by step, one by one
Higher and higher 
Step by step, rung by rung
Climbing Jacob's ladder

Coming over the airwaves 
The man says I'm overdue 
Sing along, send some money 
Join the chosen few, hey

Mister, I'm not in a hurry 
And I don't want to be like you 
All I want from tomorrow 
Is to get it better than today

Step by step, one by one
Higher and higher 
Step by step, rung by rung
Climbing Jacob's ladder

All I want from tomorrow 
Is to get it better than today

Step by step, one by one
Higher and higher 
Step by step, rung by rung
Climbing and climbing

Step by step, one by one
Step by step, rung by rung
Step by step
And step by step
Step by step
