It's out with the old and in with the new
Goodbye clouds of gray, hello skies of blue
A dip in the pool, a trip to the spa
Endless days in my chaise
The whole world according to moi

Iced tea imported from England
Lifeguards imported from Spain
Towels imported from Turkey
And turkey imported from Maine

We're gonna relax and renew
You go do

She want fabulous, that is my simple request
All things fabulous, bigger and better and best
She need something inspiring to help me get along
She need a little fabulous, is that so wrong?

Fabulous pool, fabulous splash
Fabulous parties even fabulous trash
Fabulous fashion, fabulous bling
She's got to have fabulous everything

Nothing to discuss

I need, I need, I need, I need, I need, I need
I need fabulous
