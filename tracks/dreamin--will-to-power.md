Tell me that I'm dreamin'
I'm dreamin'
Don't you stop me from believin'
I'm dreamin'

You, you came into my life
Without a reason why
Why did you have to smile?
Why did you have to touch my soul?

It cries right out for you
I love the little things you do
My heart depends on you
So say, you'll never leave me

Tell me that I'm dreamin'
I'm dreamin'
Don't you stop me from believin'
I'm dreamin'

You, you walked out of my life
We didn't even say goodbye
I didn't even hear you cry
I know how hard you tried

'Cause your soul is still part of my dreams
You'll never know what I mean
I miss you but you'll never see
You said you'd never leave me

Tell me that I'm dreamin'
I'm dreamin'
Don't you stop me from believin'
I'm dreamin'

Stay with me, don't ever go away
Being with you is a holiday
If my dream should ever fade away
You will still be here with me today

Seems so far, but I don't know why
Keep on pushin' up to the sky
I'm dreamin', believin'
Time is runnin', but I don't why
Keep on pushin' up to the sky
I'm dreamin', believin'

I'm dreamin', believin'
I'm dreamin', believin'

You mean the world to me
The time is right for you to see
You mean the world to me
The time is right for you to see

You mean the world to me
The time is right for you to see
You mean the world to me
The time is right for you to see

Seems so far, but I don't know why
Keep on pushin' up to the sky
I'm dreamin', believin'
Time is runnin', but I don't why
Keep on pushin' up to the sky
I'm dreamin', believin'

I'm dreamin', believin'
I'm dreamin'
