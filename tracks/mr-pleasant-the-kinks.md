Oh, Mr. Pleasant, how is Mrs. Pleasant?
I hope the world is treating you right and your head's in the air
And you're feeling so proud 'cause you're such a success
'Cause the whole wide world is on your side, hey hey

How are you today? People say Mr. Pleasant's good, Mr. Pleasant's kind
Mr. Pleasant's OK, Mr. Pleasant don't mind
As long as Mr. Pleasant's all right, hey hey

How are you today? How's your father? How's your mother
How's your sister? How's your brother?
How's your brand new limousine? 24 inch TV screen?
Do you like prosperity more than you like poverty?

Life is easier, so much easier, life is easier, now

Oh, Mr. Pleasant, how is Mrs. Pleasant? Did you know she was flirting
Around with a lovely young man? And he's taking her out, when you
Have to work late
So it's not so pleasant after all, hey hey

How are you today? People say Mr. Pleasant's good, Mr. Pleasant's kind
Mr. Pleasant's OK, Mr. Pleasant don't mind
As long as Mr. Pleasant's all right, hey hey

How are you today? La la la...
As long as Mr. Pleasant's all right, hey hey
