Wait a minute, let me finish
I know you don't care, but can you listen?
I came committed, guess I overdid it
Wore my heart out on a chain around my neck
But now it's missin'

So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're lookin' at me like I'm see-through
I guess I'm gonna go
I just never know how you feel
Do you even feel anything?

You said, "Don't treat me badly,"
But you said it so sadly
So I did the best I could
Not thinking you would have left me gladly
I know you're not sorry
Why should you be?
'Cause who am I to be in love
When your love never is for me, me

So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're lookin' at me like I'm see-through
I guess I'm gonna go
I just never know how you feel
Do you even feel anything?
