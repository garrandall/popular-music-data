You can't run away forever
But there's nothing wrong with getting a good head start
You want to shut out the night, you want to shut down the sun
You want to shut away the pieces of a broken heart

Think of how we'd lay down together
We'd be listening to the radio so loud and so strong
Every golden nugget coming like a gift of the gods
Someone must have blessed us when he gave us those songs

I treasure your love
I never want to lose it
You've been through the fires of hell
And I know you've got the ashes to prove it
I treasure your love
I want to show you how to use it
You've been through a lot of pain in the dirt
And I know you've got the scars to prove it

Remember everything that I told you
And I'm telling you again that it's true
When you're alone and afraid and you're completely amazed
To find there's nothing anybody can do


Keep on believing
And you'll discover baby:
There's always something magic
There's always something new
And when you really
Really need it the most
That's when rock and roll dreams come through
The beat is yours forever
The beat is always new
And when you really
Really need it the most
That's when rock and roll dreams come through
For you
