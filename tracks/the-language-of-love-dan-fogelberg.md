She says no
When she means yes
And what she wants
You know that I can't guess
When we want more
You know we ask for less
Such is the language of love

I say leave
When I mean stay
But she don't see
And so she moves away
What we really want
You know we rarely say
Such is the language of love

It's tooth for tooth
And eye for eye
We hide our hearts
And then we won't say why
It's truth for truth
And lie for lie
Such is the language of love

One cries foul
And will not speak
The other claims a little victory
And all the time
You know we fail to see
This is the language of love

When a loves begins to wander
No one ever knows
But we feel it deep inside us
Long before it shows
Long before it shows

We hem and haw
We balk and bluff
Our words don't ever 
Seem to say enough
But a simple smile
A tender touch
Speaks the true language of love

When a loves begins to wander
No one ever knows
But we feel it deep inside us
Long before it shows
Long before it shows

She says no
When she means yes
And what she wants
You know that I can't guess
When we want more
You know we ask for less
Such is the language of love
Such is the language of love
