You can blame me
Try to shame me
And still I'll care for you

You can run around
Even put me down
Still I'll be there for you

The world
May think I'm foolish
They can't see you
Like I can
Oh but anyone
Who knows what love is
Will understand

For the ones
For the ones who pity me

(Anyone) 'Cause they don't know, oh

For it's more than I could ever stand
Oh but anyone

Will understand

For it's more than I could ever stand
