Another one
We The Best Music!


Yo, he ain't messing with no average chick, pop, pop
He got Nicki, he know that he hit the jackpot
Every baller tryna score, check them shot clocks
But I hit 'em with them 'Bron/Iguodal blocks
Eat the cake and he suck on my toes, yes
Hitting them home runs, I'll be like "Go Mets!"
I want a dude that'll still kiss me when he mad
Type to cut me diamonds, he can miss me with them bags



Baby you should be up in my bed
Ooh
Do you mind, do you mind? (DJ Khaled!)
Baby you, do you mind? Do do you mind? Do you mind?


I'm just tryna get to know ya
Get a little closer, maybe post up
Ooh
Do you mind? Do you mind? Do you mind?
Do you mind? Do do you mind? Do you mind?

Baby you should be up in my bed
Ooh
Do you mind, do you mind?
Baby you, do you mind? Do do you mind? Do you mind?


You know, you know, you know, you know
He ain't got forever and ever
You know, you know, you know, you know
Let me be the one, baby, you deserve better
You know, you know, you know, you know
We ain't got forever and ever
You know, you know, you know, you know
Let me be the one, baby do you mind? Do you mind?


Oh, do you mind if I talk to you?
And do you mind if I touch you there?
Baby know you can't do better baby
I know that it don't get no better than me
Let's not waste that time
You ain't gotta hold back
'Cause once I get inside
You won't change your mind, know that you can take it
No need to hesitate, I need a new patient
I'm not used to waiting, I want you to give it to me
Come on let me taste it until I get enough
Hope you're ready cause I'mma beat it up
Do you mind when I'm behind it? Know how to heat it up


I should, I should be the one, baby you gon' learn that
Girl I know your body, know where every curve at
We be going all night till the early
Know you, know you wanna take off when you on my runway
We ain't got to talk bodies conversate
Baby by the way I touch you you know what I'm saying
Oh, oh, oh, oh ride it slow
Oh, oh, oh


I'm just tryna get to know ya
Get a little closer, maybe post up
Ooh
Do you mind? Do you mind? Do you mind?
Do you mind? Do do you mind? Do you mind?

Baby you should be up in my bed
Ooh
Do you mind, do you mind?
Baby you, do you mind? Do do you mind? Do you mind?


You know, you know, you know
He ain't got forever and ever
You know, you know, you know, you know
Let me be the one, baby you deserve better
You know, you know, you know, you know
We ain't got forever and ever
You know, you know, you know, you know
Let me be the one, baby do you mind? Do you mind?


Man with all this red carpet "You know what I'm saying?"
Future Hendrix
I'm a do that favor, drippin' flavor in the two piece
I'm gonna keep my promise, never treat you like a groupie
Calamari dinners, got you eatin' raw sushi
Still in the trap but I like my bitches bougie
Two cups of Styrofoam, excuse me little mama
I can hold you down, be your friend and your lover
You want watches, new Versaces, you want CÃ©line
Top back, dreamin' money ain't a ting


Seeing two G-wagons in my driveway
Facetime, two black bottles by my fireplace
Fell out with your peoples so you took the pictures down
Instagram ain't been the same since you so distant now
Take you shopping in other places that I won't name
First time your friends really got to see Balmain
20 million cash, seen it there with my two eyes
We the best and I told you this back in '05
(Maybach Music)


I'm just tryna get to know ya
Get a little closer, maybe post up
Ooh
Do you mind? Do you mind? Do you mind?
Do you mind? Do do you mind? Do you mind?

Baby you should be up in my bed
Ooh
Do you mind, do you mind?
Baby you, do you mind? Do do you mind? Do you mind?


Ooh, just in case you need me
I don't mind
Yo, tell them what to do, tell them what to do, tell them what to do
When you see a bad bitch in front of you baby
Yeah, assume the position


I'm just tryna get to know ya
Get a little closer, maybe post up
Ooh
Do you mind? Do you mind? Do you mind?
Do you mind? Do do you mind? Do you mind?

Baby you should be up in my bed
Ooh
Do you mind, do you mind?
Baby you, do you mind? Do do you mind? Do you mind?
