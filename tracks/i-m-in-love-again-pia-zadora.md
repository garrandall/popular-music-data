I gave my heart away
The first time that I loved
And it came back, broken up
What a fool I was
Just to give my heart away, now babe

Said I'd never love again
Told you so when you walked in
But you changed my mind
In a little time
Being oh so kind

I'm in love again
In a love that feels so right
When I'm holding you
And I'm touching you
In a closeness that feels so right

I'm in love again
In a love I've never known
And makes me strong
And it sings my song
And it's mine and mine alone

I can't believe myself
When I tried to put you down
I would turn my head around
And gently made me fall

After all the hurt I had known before
I was afraid to try again
Thought that love had reached its end
Then you held me tight
And I couldn't fight
What I knew was right
I'm in love again

And it's where my must be
In a love for two
Only me and you
Living openly and free

I'm in love again
In a love I've never known
And makes me strong
And it sings my song
And it's mine
And mine alone

Lying with you in the still of the night
Feeling the warmth of the sweet morning light
Everything seems so perfectly right
To love again

The warmth of your hand
The taste of your kiss
I never knew such a love could exist
Bringing me to the wonder of you
And in love again

I'm in love again
In a love that feels so right
When I'm holding you
And I'm touching you
In the closeness of the night

I'm in love again
In a love I've never known
'Cause makes me strong
'Cause it sings my song
And it's mine and mine alone

I'm in love again
In love again
In love again
I'm in love again
In love again
In love again
