Well, it's good to hear your voice
I hope you're doing fine
And if you ever wonder, I'm lonely here tonight
I'm lost here in this moment and time keeps slipping by
And if I could have just one wish, I'd have you by my side


Oh oh, I miss you
Oh oh, I need you


And I love you more than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place
It gets harder every day
Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask me, I will stay
I will stay


Well, I try to live without you
And tears fall from my eyes
I'm alone and I feel empty
God, I'm torn apart inside
I look up at the stars, hoping you're doing the same
And somehow I feel closer
And I can hear you say


Oh oh, I miss you
Oh oh, I need you


And I love you more than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place
It gets harder every day
Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask me, I will stay
I will


Stay, always stay
I never wanna lose you
And if I had to, I would choose you
So stay
Please always stay
You're the one that I hold onto
'Cause my heart would stop without you


I love you more than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place
It gets harder everyday
Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry that it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask me, I will stay
I will stay
I'll always stay
And I love you more than I did before
And I'm sorry that it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask I will stay
I will stay
I will stay
