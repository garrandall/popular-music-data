I've got your picture hanging on the wall
But it can't see or come to me
When I call your name
I know it's just a picture in a frame

Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

I've got your picture hanging on the wall
But it can't see or come to me
When I call your name
I know it's just a picture in a frame

I read your letters when you're not near
But they don't move me
They don't touch me like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear

I play the game of fantasy
I pretend that I'm not in reality
The shelter of your arms will comfort me

I've got some memories to look back on
Though they help when you phone
I'm well aware nothing can
Take the place of you being there

I will go where you lead
Always there in time of need
And when I lose my will
You'll be there to push me up the hill

You're all, you're all I need
You're all, you're all I need
You're all, you're all I need
