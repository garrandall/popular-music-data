Saying I love you
Is not the words I want to hear from you
Its not that I want you not to say
But if you only knew
How easy it would be to show me how you feel

More than words
Is all you have to do to make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say
that you love me, yeah
Cause I'd already know.


What would you do (what would you do)
If my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say
If I took those words away
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying I Love You

(just saying I love you, saying I love you)
More than words
(just saying I love you, saying I love you)


Now that I've tried to (now that I've tried to)
Talk to you and make you understand
All you have to do is
Close your eyes and just reach out your hand
And touch me
Hold me close don't ever let me go

More than words
Is all I ever needed you to show
Then you wouldn't have to say
That you love me, yeah
Cause I'd already know

(just saying I love you, saying I love you)
More than words
