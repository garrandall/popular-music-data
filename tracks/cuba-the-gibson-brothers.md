Cuba
Quiero bailar la salsa
Cuba
Quiero bailar la salsa


You dance to the music like nobody does
The first time I saw you, I knew it was love


Cuba
Quiero bailar la salsa
Cuba
Quiero bailar la salsa


My heart is on fire, the night is divine
My only desire is making you mine


You're the one that I want
You're the one, yes, you are


Cuba
Quiero bailar la salsa
Cuba
Quiero bailar la salsa


When you're in motion you seem not to care
You hide your emotions, the joy, the despair


You're the one that I want
You're the one, yes, you are


Cuba
Quiero bailar la salsa
Cuba
Quiero bailar la salsa


You dance to the music like nobody does
The first time I saw you, I knew it was love


You're the one that I want
You're the one, yes, you are

You're the one that I want
You're the one, yes, you are


Cuba
Quiero bailar la salsa
Cuba
Quiero bailar la salsa
Cuba
Quiero bailar la salsa
Cuba
Quiero bailar la salsa


You're the one that I want
You're the one, yes, you are


Cuba
Quiero bailar la salsa
Cuba
Quiero bailar la salsa
Cuba
Quiero bailar la salsa
