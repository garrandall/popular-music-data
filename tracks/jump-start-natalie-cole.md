Alright Paul, oh, oh, oh
Uh, oh, uh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, hey, oh, yeah

Feels like my battery's in need of a jump
Our love is running down, done fell into a slump
Give me a spark to get the fire burning
A get my engine movin', set these wheels a turnin'

Our love could use some rejuvenation
You bring the wine, I'll bring the sweet conversation
Romance is here to stay
I'll testify 'cause I need some today

So won'tcha jump start my heart
Charge me up when I'm runnin' down
Oh, jump start my heart
Lift my feet up off the ground

When it comes to lovin', baby can't get enough
Hot wire me satisfy me, don't give me up
Turn on the heat on a cold winter's morning
Don't let the seasons change and nature catch me callin'

Can't let this feelin' just slip away
Our love was meant to last forever and a day
We can't neglect what we cherish the most
So drop your foolish pride 'cause I need you more and more

(Nothing good comes easily)
Oh, we've got to work it 'til we get it right
(You see I love you so)
I'll, I'll never let you go
(Never let you go)
I wanna hug you and kiss you, keep you right here with me

So won't ya jump start my heart
Oh, charge me up when I'm running down
Would you do that for me, baby
Jump start my heart
Hey, lift my feet up off the ground
Oh, don't let me down

Jump start my heart
Woo, charge me up when I'm running down
Would you do that for me, baby
Jump start my heart, hey, hey
Lift my feet up off the ground
Don't let me down
(Jump)

Don't step on me now
Alright let's uncross those wire
(Jump)
When I say hit it, Paul hit it
Ignition, ignition
Give it a little gas Paul, come on, ou

Oh, baby uh, oh, uh, oh, oh
(Jump)
I say don't stomp hard, baby
(Jump, jump)
(Jump)
Lift me up
Take it on up Paul
(Jump start my heart, my heart)

Oh, oh
(Nothing good comes easily)
Oh, we've got to work it 'til we get it right
You see I love you so I'll never let you go
(I wanna hug you and kiss you keep you right here with me)
Yeah, yeah

(Jump start my heart)
Oh charge me up when I'm runnin' down
Oh, don't let me down
(Jump start my heart)
Hey, hey lift my feet up off the ground
Lift me up, lift me
(Jump start my heart)
Oh, do that for me, baby
(Charge me up when I'm runnin' down)
Oh

I know the groove is cold
Jump, jump start my heart, jump, jump start my heart
Jump, jump start my heart, jump, jump start my heart
Jump, jump start my heart, jump, jump start my heart
Jump, jump start my heart, jump, jump start my heart

Get it, get it Paul

(Jump start my heart)
Hey, hey, hey
(Charge me up when I'm running down)
A get those engines movin'
(Jump start my heart, lift my feet up off the ground)
It's time we started groovin'
(Jump start my heart)
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
(Charge me up when I'm runnin' down)
