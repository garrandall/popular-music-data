Give it up for naughty by nature,
(O.P.P)
OPP, how can I explain it
I'll take you frame by frame it
To have y'all jumpin' shall we singin' it
O is for Other, P is for People scratchin' temple
The last P, well, that's not that simple
It's sorta like another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missin' here
How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at
Who thinks it's wrong 'cause I'm splittin' and co-hittin' at
Well if you do, that's OPP and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me) 
Who's down with OPP (Every last homie)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me) 
Who's down with OPP (All the homies)
(Hip Hop Hooray)
Hip hop hooray-ho-hay-ho-hay-ho-hay-ho
I live and die for Hip Hop 
This is Hip Hop for today
I give props to Hip Hop so Hip Hop hooray
Ho-hay-ho-hay-ho-hay-ho
Smooth it out now
(Uptown Anthem)
Hey, you could smoke a spliff with a cliff
But there's still no mountain high enough, or wide enough to touch
The naughty nappy nasty
Naughty naughty nappy nasty 
Naughty, naughty, naughty, naughty
We gonna BREAK, we gonna BASH
We gonna ROLL, we gonna SMASH

Here we go yo
(Feel Me Flow)
Here we go now,
Holla if ya hear me though, come and feel me flow

You 'bout to feel the chronicles of a bionical lyric
Lyrically splittin dismissin
I'm on a mission of just hitting
Now it's written and kitten hittin with mittens
I'm missing wishing man listen
I glisten like sun and water while fishing.
Bust the move and then swerve
Serve words with nerve embedded I said it word
Damn, you nerd man, you heard
(Craziest)
Jersey homies are the craziest
New York homies are the craziest
DC homies are the craziest
Philly homies are the craziest
California homies are the craziest
Chi town homies are the craziest
Texas homies are the craziest
Utah homies are the craziest
(Ghetto Bastard)
Some get a little and some get none
Some catch a bad one and some leave the job half done
I was one who never had and always mad
Never knew my dad motherfuck the fag
Well anyway I did pick up lift and click up
See many stick ups 'cause niggas had the trigger hick-ups
I couldn't get a job, nappy hair was not allowed
My mother couldn't afford us all, she had to throw me out
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright now (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)
