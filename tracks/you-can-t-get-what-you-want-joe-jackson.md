Sometimes you start feelin'
So lost and lonely
Then you'll find
It's all been in your mind
Sometimes you think
Someone is the one and only
Can't you see
It could be you and me?
But if there's any doubt
Then I think I'll leave it out
'Cause I'll tell you one thing
You can't get what you want
Till you know what you want
Said, you can't get what you want
Till you know what you want?
Sometimes you keep busy
Reaching out for something
You don't care
There's always something there
Sometimes you can't see
That all you need is one thing
If it's right, you could sleep at night
But it can take some time
But at least I'm here in line
'Cause I'll tell you one thing
You can't get what you want
Till you know what you want
Said, you can't get what you want
Till you know what you want
Sometimes you can't see
That all you need is one thing
If it's right, you could sleep at night
But it can take some time
But at least I'm here in line
'Cause I'll tell you one thing
You can't get what you want
Till you know what you want
Said, you can't get what you want
Till you know what you want
Tell everyone
You can't get what you want
What you want?
Tell everyone
You can't get what you want
What you want?
