Last night I couldn't sleep
I found it hard to even breathe
Oh, I'm in trouble deep
With you
Today I stayed in bed
Can't shake these voices in my head
I've fallen off the edge
With you
Well all my friends say that I'm way out of touch
If I'm not crazy then baby
This must be love

I would go anywhere
Do anything
No, I don't care
Long as I know
I'll always go
With you

Now it's all making sense
Forever's in the present tense
I know it all begins
With you
And so this story goes
I am yours to have and hold
And I can't wait to grow old
With you
Well all my friends say that I'm way out of touch
If I'm not crazy then baby
I'm crazy in love

I would go anywhere
Do anything
No, I don't care
Long as I know
I'll always go
With you

Well all my friends say that I'm way out of touch
If I'm not crazy then baby
This could be love

I would go anywhere
Oh...I would go anywhere
Do anything
No, I don't care
Long as I know
I'll always go
With you
