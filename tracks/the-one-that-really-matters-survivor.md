I know your mind like the back of my hand
A race that I ran before
Are you so blind that you'd turn your back
On love and slam the door
If you're searching for something more
Have a good time
But if you'd follow your heart
You're gonna find that I'm

*The one, the one
The one that really matters
The one that really cares
The one, when your whole world is shattered
Snap your fingers and I'll be there.*

There's someone new
He's your brand new toy
You could break that poor boy in two
If that's your style
I should have known from the start
This heart wants no part of you
But if you're still the same girl I knew
All in good time
You're gonna follow your heart
And you're gonna find I'm still...

( * Repeat)
