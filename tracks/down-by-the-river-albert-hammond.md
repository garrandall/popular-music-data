City life was gettin' us down
So we spent a weekend out of town
Pitched the tent on a patch of ground
Down by the river

Lit a fire and drank some wine
You put your jeans on the top of mine
Said, come in the water's fine
Down by the river

Down by the river
Down by the river
I said, come in the water's fine
Down by the river

Didn't feel too good all night
So we took a walk in the morning light
We came across the strangest sight
Down by the river

Silver fish lay on its side
It was washed up by the early tide
I wonder how it died
Down by the river

Down by the river
Down by the river
A silver fish lay on its side
Down by the river

Doctor put us both to bed
He dosed us up and he shook his head
Only foolish people go, he said
Down by the river

Why do willows weep, said he
Because they're dying gradually
From the waste from the factory
Down by the river

Down by the river
Down by the river
Why do willows weep, said he
Down by the river

In time, the river banks will die
And the reeds will wilt and the ducks won't fly
There'll be a tear in the otter's eye
Down by the river

The banks will soon be black and dead
And where the otter raised its head
Will be a clean white skull instead
Down by the river

Down by the river
Down by the river
The banks will soon be black and dead
Down by the river

Down by the river
Down by the river
The banks will soon be black and dead
Down by the river
