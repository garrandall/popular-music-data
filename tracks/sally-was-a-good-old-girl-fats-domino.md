Sally used to carry my books to school
(Sally was a good old girl)
Helped me with my homework 'cause I was a fool
(Sally was a good old girl)

If you wanted a kiss or a little bit of squeeze
She was always willing and do her best to please
The girl's made for love and not made to tease
(Sally was a good old girl)

Sally was a good old girl
Sally was a good old girl
No matter what the request, she gave it her best
Sally was a good old girl

Now her folk was poor and she helped all she could
(Sally was a good old girl)
The hardest workin' girl in the neighborhood
(Sally was a good old girl)

Now she walked up and down the street all day
Selling neckties to the ones who'd pay
If you couldn't afford them, then she'd give 'em away
(Sally was a good old girl)

Sally was a good old girl
(Ah, ah, ah)
Sally was a good old girl
(Oh yes)
No matter what the request, she gave it her best
Sally was a good old girl

She was the favorite of all the men
(Sally was a good old girl)
And all the women despised her then
(Sally was a good old girl)

All the girls talked 'bout Sally, but Sally didn't care
She kept on workin' and doin' her share
She wound up married to a millionaire
(Sally was a good old girl)

Sally was a good old girl
(Ah, ah, ah)
Sally was a good old girl
No matter what the request, she gave it her best
Sally was a good old girl

Sally was a good old girl
Sally was a good old girl
No matter what the request, she gave it her best
Sally was a good old girl

Sally was a good old girl
Sally was a good old girl
No matter what the request, she gave it her best
Sally was a good old girl
