From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinking, step into the sun
There's more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done
Some say, "Eat or be eaten"
Some say, "Live and let live"
But all are agreed as they join the stampede
You should never take more than you give


In the circle of life
It's the wheel of fortune
It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle, the circle of life


Some of us fall by the wayside
And some of us soar to the stars
And some of us sail through our troubles
And some have to live with the scars
There's far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rollin' high through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round


In the circle of life
It's the wheel of fortune
It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding, yeah
In the circle, the circle of life


It's the wheel of fortune, yeah
It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding, yeah
In the circle, the circle of life
On the path unwinding, yeah
In the circle, the circle of life
