Johnny is a joker (he's a bird)
A very funny joker (he's a bird)
But when he jokes my honey (he's a dog)
His jokin' ain't so funny (what a dog)
Johnny is a joker that's a-tryin' to steal my baby (he's a bird dog)

Johnny sings a love song (like a bird)
He sings the sweetest love song (ya ever heard)
But when he sings to my gal (what a howl)
To me he's just a wolf dog (on the prowl)
Johnny wants to fly away and puppy-love my baby (he's a bird dog)

Hey, bird dog get away from my quail
Hey, bird dog you're on the wrong trail
Bird dog you better leave my lovey-dove alone
Hey, bird dog, get away from my chick
Hey, bird dog, you better get away quick
Bird dog you better find a chicken little of your own

Johnny kissed the teacher (he's a bird)
He tiptoed up to reach her (he's a bird)
Well he's the teachers pet now (he's a dog)
What he wants he can get now (what a dog)
He even made the teacher let him sit next to my baby (he's a bird dog)

Hey, bird dog get away from my quail
Hey, bird dog you're on the wrong trail
Bird dog you better leave my lovey-dove alone
Hey, bird dog get away from my chick
Hey, bird dog you better get away quick
Bird dog you better find a chicken little of your own
He's birdâ¦â¦
