(Oldie but a goodie...) 
True MC, no slack on the track
Here to tell the people that love's what we lack 
In this family we gotta love like Christ 
So precise in your life so take this advice 
Brother to brother we need to learn to love each other 
So lean on me when you're in trouble 
I cast my cares on Christ 'cause He cares for me 
So when you need a shoulder to cry on, just lean

Lean on me when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on 
For it won't be long 
'Til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on 

Sometimes in our lives 
We all have pain, we all have sorrows 
But if we are wise 
We know that there's always tomorrow 

Lean on me when you're not strong 
And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on 
For it won't be long 
'Til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on 

Please, swallow your pride 
If I have things you need to borrow 
For no one can fill those of your needs, yeah
If you won't let them show 

Lean on me when you're not strong 
And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on 
For it won't be long 
'Til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on 

You just call on your brother when you need a hand 
We all need somebody to lean on 
I just might have some problems that you understand, yeah 
We all need somebody to lean on 

Lean on me, when you're not strong 
And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on 
For it won't be long 
'Til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on 

Make it funky, make it funky 
Make it funky, make it funky 
Make it funky, make it funky 

Cause I'm housin' this joint like a brother with an attitude 
And comin' straight so you best give me latitude 
Leanin' on my boys from the word get go 
And bein' there for them 'cause the Lord said so 
Many of us just don't know what to do 
Well take it here and now from the boy named True 
Don't dog a brother out when he stumbles and falls 
Just be there to lean on, y'all 

Call me, call me, just call me 
Call me, call me, just call me, lean on me 

Don't you know that I'll be there, you can lean on me 
Don't you know that I'll be there, you can lean on me 
Don't you know that I'll be there, you can lean on me
...
