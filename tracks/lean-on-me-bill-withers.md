Hm
Hm hm hm hm
Hm hm hm hm
Hm hm hm hm hm


Sometimes in our lives, we all have pain
We all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that there's always tomorrow


Lean on me, when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on


Please swallow your pride
If I have things you need to borrow
For no one can fill
Those of your needs
That you won't let show


You just call on me brother, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on


Lean on me, when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on


You just call on me brother, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on


If there is a load you have to bear
That you can't carry
I'm right up the road
I'll share your load
If you just call me


(Call me) If you need a friend
(Call me) Call me, uhuh uhuh
(Call me) If you need a friend
(Call me)  If you ever need a friend
(Call me) Call me
(Call me) Call me
(Call me) Call me
(Call me) Call me
(Call me) If you need a friend
(Call me) Call me
(Call me) Call me
(Call me) Call me
(Call me) Call me
(Call me)
