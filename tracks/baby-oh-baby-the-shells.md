Baby oh baby, I love you, love you so madly
Baby oh baby, I need you, need you so badly

There is a favorite, favorite girl I meet
Baby oh baby, there is nothing I wouldn't do for you
Yeah, I go walkin' down the street

Yeah, yeah, yeah, on the arm to look nice
But then when I'm with you, I'm in paradise
Baby I love you, oh baby I do for you

Baby oh baby, why don't you be true?
Baby oh baby, there is nothing I wouldn't do

Yeah, yeah, yeah, on the arm to look nice
But then when I'm with you, I'm in paradise
Baby I love you, oh baby I do for you

Baby I do, I do love you
