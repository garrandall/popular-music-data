It’s knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk (free to walk, free to walk, free to walk, free to walk)
That makes me know that I can leave
My sleeping bag behind your couch (yes it’ll be right there)
Yes it does (yes it’ll be right there)
It’s knowing I’m not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And your ink stains that have dried upon some line
Keeps you on the back roads (back roads)
By the rivers of my memory (memory)
It keeps you ever gentle on my mind (gentle on my mind, yeah)
Oh, oh oohoh (gentle on my mind, yeah)
It’s not clinging to some rocks and ivy planted
On some column now that binds me, no, it don’t
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking
We did it, baby
It’s knowing that the world will not be cursing or forgiving
When they turn around and find
That you’re moving on the back roads (back roads)
You’re still on my memory (memory)
You’re ever gentle on my mind (gentle on my mind, yeah)
Yes, I’m baby (gentle on my mind, yeah)


Yeah, you are gentle (gentle on my mind, yeah)
You are gentle (gentle on my mind, yeah)
You are gentle and gentle (gentle on my mind, yeah)
You are gentle on the back roads (gentle on my mind, yeah)
Yeah, yeah (gentle on my mind, yeah)
You are gentle on my mind (gentle on my mind, yeah)
Say that, babe (gentle on my mind, yeah)
You are gentle on my mind (gentle on my mind, yeah)
Yeah (gentle on my mind, yeah)
