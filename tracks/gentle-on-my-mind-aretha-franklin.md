Itâs knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk (free to walk, free to walk, free to walk, free to walk)
That makes me know that I can leave
My sleeping bag behind your couch (yes itâll be right there)
Yes it does (yes itâll be right there)

Itâs knowing Iâm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And your ink stains that have dried upon some line
Keeps you on the backroads (backroads)
By the rivers of my memory (memory)
It keeps you ever gentle on my mind (gentle on my mind, yeah)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ouh (gentle on my mind, yeah)

Itâs not clinging to some rocks and ivy planted
on some column now that binds me, no, it donât
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking
We did it, baby

Itâs knowing that the world will not be cursing or forgiving
When they turn around and find
That youâre moving on the backroads (backroads)
Youâre still on my memory (memory)
Youâre ever gentle on my mind (gentle on my mind, yeah)
Yes, Iâm baby (gentle on my mind, yeah)

Yeah, youâre gentle (gentle on my mind, yeah)
Youâre gentle (gentle on my mind, yeah)
Youâre gentle and gentle (gentle on my mind, yeah)
Youâre gentle on the backroads (gentle on my mind, yeah)
Yeah, yeah (gentle on my mind, yeah)
Youâre gentle on my mind (gentle on my mind, yeah)
Say that, babe (gentle on my mind, yeah)
Youâre gentle on my mind (gentle on my mind, yeah)
Yeah (gentle on my mind, yeah)
