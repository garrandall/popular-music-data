Bop 'til you drop 
In the hot city 
Keep on working day and night 
Don't stop 'til you get what you want

Bop 'til you drop
'Til you sit pretty 
Burn the candle, burn it bright 
Love won't, love won't wait

You wake up wired and draw on your makeup 
And the city breathes 
And the city jumps to life 

Lately it seems 
Your time is all used up 
Chasing dreams 
Of money and the good life

But there is something 
You've been thinking of 
Lately you're feeling 
The power of love 

Everybody says it's
So hard to hold 
The alarm rings 
You gotta get up, you gotta get up

Bop 'til you drop
In the hot city 
Keep on working day and night 
Don't stop 'til you get what you want

Bop 'til you drop
'Til you sit pretty 
Burn the candle, burn it bright 
Love won't, love won't wait

Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

People say you're the lucky one 
But you don't believe it 
And you want to stop 
And you want to take some time 
To sus' out a feeling and look for a reason 
And the flesh is weak 
But the spirit is willing

'Cause there is something 
You've been thinking of 
Lately you're feeling 
The power of love 

Everybody says it's so
So hard to hold 
The alarm rings 
You gotta get up, you gotta get up

Bop 'til you drop
In the hot city 
Keep on working day and night 
Don't stop 'til you get what you want

Bop 'til you drop
'Til you sit pretty 
Burn the candle, burn it bright 
Love won't, love won't wait

There is something 
You've been thinking of 
Lately you're feeling 
The power of love 

Everybody says it's so
So hard to hold 
The alarm rings 
You gotta get up, you gotta get up

Bop 'til you drop
In the hot city 
Keep on working day and night
