Baby's gone away
Baby's gone away
Baby's gone away
And left me lonely
Didn't say goodbye
Didn't tell me why
Just left me here to cry
With nothing but a memory
The pain I feel inside
Is more than I can hide
I need her by my side
Oh where can baby be
Won't somebody please
Bring her back to me
And she'll never
Be lonely anymore
A funny photograph
That made the gang all laugh
Two tickets torn in half
Our only reminder
A ribbon from her hair
Her little teddy bear
They're just waiting there
For me to find her
I miss her so tonight
I long to hold her tight
I hope that she's all right
Oh where can baby be
Won't somebody please
Bring her back to me
And she'll never
Be lonely again
