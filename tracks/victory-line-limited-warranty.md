Soldiers, drop your toys
Whatever be the sign
Stand in line to face each other
On a field that's bleached
A lion's heart eases
For every acre you recover

And we can survive it all
With the promise that is given
Wait for me
‘Cause I’ll be coming home for you
Stand, fall or die (this time)
Wait for me
‘Cause I’ll be coming home for you
All is fine behind the victory line

A distant drummer beats
He’s called upon to guard his nation
Flowers on the streets
Are wilting in the heat
Memories of our civil nature

And did we forget it all
Silent echos of the free
Wait for me
‘Cause I’ll be coming home for you
Stand, fall or die (this time)
Wait for me
‘Cause I’ll be coming home for you
All is fine behind the victory line

And did we forget it all
Silent echoes of the free
Wait for me
‘Cause I’ll be coming home for you
Stand, fall or die (this time)
Wait for me
‘Cause I’ll be coming home for you
All is fine behind the victory
Wait for me
All is fine behind the victory line
