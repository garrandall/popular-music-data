Money sprung, money sprung

Fuck it, I'm back with another one
Fuck it up and do another one
My niggas do not shoot dirty guns
Shoot it up and get another one
I keep on counting them hundreds up, I think I'm falling in love with 'em
I keep on counting them hundreds my nigga, I think that I'm money sprung
Money sprung, money sprung, my nigga, I think I'm money sprung
Money sprung, money sprung, my nigga, I think I'm money sprung
I keep on counting them hundreds up, I think I'm falling in love with 'em
I keep on counting them hundreds my nigga, I think that I'm money sprung

Track after track and another one, know that's a hit, they can't fuck with us
Nigga, you don't gotta like me to understand where I'm coming from
I know you would eat it, what's up, don't chew on the dick like a bubble gum
Told herself to be the plug, now everybody wanna fuck with her
Everybody need love, everybody need drugs
Nobody wanna be a dub
Every fit I put on probably cost me like a dub
I'm way too up, they can't keep up
Yeah, yeah
I'm way too stuck, I faced two cups
Yeah, yeah
My chain it look like a puck
My nigga, I'm icy as fuck
Yeah, yeah
I feel like the King of New York
My jeweler is better than yours
Yeah, yeah
A hundred sitting on my neck
Another hundred on the arm
Yeah, yeah
I put the city on my back
How can I ever go wrong?
Yeah, yeah
I don't need no groupie love
Go holla at my nigga Don (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I put my number in your phone, just DM me if it was wrong (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I told her my name is Artist
Now she wanna call me Arty
Telling me about a party
Told her, "I'm the one performing"
Fuck it up before the party started

Fuck it, I'm back with another one
Fuck it up and do another one
My niggas do not shoot dirty guns
Shoot it up and get another one
I keep on counting them hundreds up, I think I'm falling in love with 'em
I keep on counting them hundreds my nigga, I think that I'm money sprung
Money sprung, money sprung, my nigga, I think I'm money sprung
Money sprung, money sprung, my nigga, I think I'm money sprung
I keep on counting them hundreds up, I think I'm falling in love with 'em
I keep on counting them hundreds my nigga, I think that I'm money sprung


I'm ahead of the race
Flooring the gas, I'm passing the cops that I lead on a chase
If they come find out this weapon I placed
They might just give me a federal case
All of my folks has a residue taste
Rollie presidential when that presidential
Counting blue strips with the President face
I got the votes, don't you ever debate
Yeah, yeah
I got a chef at the crib, little hoe, I don't never do dates
Yeah, yeah
We are not looking for friends, so, ain't no competitors safe
Yeah, yeah
Five in the morning, I'm drinking on dirty, it's never too late
Yeah, yeah
Leaving the spot had to switch up the whip, they was checking the plates
I'm still a menace
I do what I say and I won't give a fuck if you feel offended
You selling your soul just to get attention
I crept with a pole 'cause I feel the tension
Trappers, they love me
They throw on that Don, they get on that road with a pigeon in it
Little bitch you know me, I'm really the Don
I don't gotta try hard to fit the image
Look at my cup, it's Dirty Diana
I dropped two bananas and shook up the Fanta
Booked in Atlanta
I go to the club with the paper and I throw a book on the dancer
I am the one they was counting out
Now I get hundreds and count it out
Designer shit, they can't pronounce it
I'm styling out, they tryna spell it and sound it out
Yeah, yeah
