Yeah


I'm from the Bronx, not Benny
I swear I don't even know why I did it
AP cost a hundred and fifty (Hundred and fifty)
I be feeling like I'm drowning with it (Drowning with it)
If you tryna ride the wave, you should be afraid that you don't drown in it
I be feeling like the king of my city
From the Bronx, not Benny, yeah, yeah
500K, that's just on the Richie
My nigga, you don't wanna play with my city
Niggas die every day in my city
Whole lotta young wild niggas (Wild niggas)
If you tryna ride the wave, you should be afraid that you might drown in it
I be feeling like the king of my city (King of my city)
And every nigga with me wearing Amiri


Headshot like baow, nigga (Pow)
Headshot like pow, nigga (Pow)
Hit him twice, make sure you don't miss him
Them bullets in this pistol look like a missile (Look like a missile)
Headshot like baow, nigga
Hit 'em up, man down, nigga
Send a nigga on a motherfuckin' mission
It's fucked up, yeah, I know they gon' miss him
I am not with it, yeah
Try to play with me, you might end up missing (Might end up missing)
VVS's Elliot, not Missy
Sorry, miss, these Elliot VVS's
Long johns on just for the crills (Just for the crills)
Long johns on, crill tuckin' (Crill tuckin')
If you gotta pay the bills, fuck it (Yeah)
Westside nigga from the Bronx, yeah
Throw it up like LeBron, yeah
Thirty rounds on a hundred FN's (Hundred FN's)
All my guys came with the shits (Came with the shits)
And they might get to bustin', yeah (Bustin', yeah)
If I like your necklace, yeah (Necklace, yeah)
Those guys might take off your necklace (Take off your necklace)
Fuck a fight, I ain't with the Tekken (I ain't with the Tekken)
Those guys might want you to check in (Might want you to check in)


I'm from the Bronx, not Benny
I swear I don't even know why I did it
AP cost a hundred and fifty
I be feeling like I'm drowning with it
If you tryna ride the wave, you should be afraid that you don't drown in it
I be feeling like the king of my city
From the Bronx, not Benny, yeah, yeah
500K, that's just on the Richie
My nigga, you don't wanna play with my city
Niggas die every day in my city
Whole lotta young wild niggas
If you tryna ride the wave, you should be afraid that you might drown in it
I be feeling like the king of my city
And every nigga with me wearing Amiri
