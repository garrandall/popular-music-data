Gee, whiz
Oh, have you seen my girl
Gee, whiz
She's out of this world
She's got lips so sweet
Candy red
Honey bees flying
All around her head
Candy
Candy
Oh wee
She's got a heart so warm
Oh wee
She's like a lucky charm
She's got eyes so bright
Sky blue
A voice so soft
Just like the morning dew
Candy
Candy
She's just a lump of sugar
And sweetened my tea
And one of these days
She's gonna marry me
Gee, whiz
She's got everything
Gee, whiz
She should be a queen
She's got a loving heart
Gold pure
One of these days
I'll make her mine I'm sure
Candy
Candy
Candy
Candy
Candy
