Don't try and understand me, you never could do that
Ah, and in the end you'd wind up being hurt
I'm a man with too many problems that keep pounding on my brain

So if you want me you'll take me for what I'm worth
(If you want me you'll take me for what I'm worth)

I don't pretend to be a saint, my sins they are many
But there's no one perfect in this universe
And though you think I'm weird, don't try and change me, dear

'Cause if you want me you'll take me for what I'm worth
(If you want me you'll take me for what I'm worth)

Hear a howling wind outside my door, there's restlessness within
Oh, I'm like a rain cloud that one day may burst
We both know I'll be leavin' and if one little tear you grieve

Ah, it's all right 'cause that's all I'm really worth
(It's all right 'cause that's all I'm really worth)

And if you think about me in your lonesome hours
Ah, and on your lips there's a sweet word and not a curse
Ah, then I'll be comin' back one day when my wandering is over

Ah, if you want me you'll take me for what I'm worth
(If you want me you'll take me for what I'm worth)

Ah, if you want me you'll take me for what I'm worth
(If you want me you'll take me for what I'm worth)
