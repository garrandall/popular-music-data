After lovin' you the longest time
Your eyes show me the exit sign
I can't ignore the sign I read
'Cause when I hold you, how cold you feel

But it's so hard for me to say goodbye
Yes, I know you see tears in my eyes
So I'll go before I break down and cry
'Cause it's so hard for me to say goodbye

Girl, I'm leavin' you, I won't try to force you back
Although I'll be lovin' you, at least my pride will stay intact
My heart says "Stay", but my mind says "No"
The longer I delay, I just won't go

But it's so hard for me to say goodbye
I can't change from a lover to a friend
I can't stay once I know it's the end
'Cause it's so hard for me to say goodbye

It's so hard, ohyeah
It's so hard, yeah, yeah

Yes, I know you see tears in my eyes
So I'll go before I break down and cry
'Cause it's so hard for me to say goodbye
'Cause it's so hard for me to say goodbye

'Cause it's so hard for me to say goodbye
Every time I think about it, it's so hard for me to say goodbye
I'll break down and cry every time I think about it
It's hard, oh
