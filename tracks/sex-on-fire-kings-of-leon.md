Lay where you're layin'
Don't make a sound
I know they're watchin'
They're watchin'
All the commotion
The kiddie like play
It has people talkin'
Talkin'


You!
Your sex is on fire


The dark of the alley
The breakin' of day
Head while I'm drivin'
I'm drivin'
Soft lips are open
Them knuckles are pale
Feels like you're dyin'
You're dyin'


You!
Your sex is on fire
Consumed!
With what's just transpired


Hot as a fever
Rattle of Bones
I could just taste it
Taste it
If it's not forever
If it's just tonight
Oh, we're still the greatest
The greatest, the greatest


You!
Your sex is on fire
You!
Your sex is on fire, ah
Consumed!
With what's to transpire
And you!
Your sex is on fire
Consumed!
With what's to transpire
