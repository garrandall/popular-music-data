(Verse 1:)
I used to think you were the perfect one
I’d watch your every move, couldn’t get enough
I’d see you in my dreams, always on my mind
You made me wish there was no end to time

You said we had what they called a real thing
All I know is that you took away the key
You gave your heart to somebody new
But now he’s gone, so tell me what you’re gonna do

(Chorus:)
‘Cause I’ve got a new love now
And she really turns me on
I’ve got a new love now baby
Since you’ve been gone
I’ve been lost and found
And I thank you everyday
For leaving me this way
Na-na-na-na-hey

(Verse 2:)
There was a time when I’d give you anything
I’d walk a mile for you in the pouring rain
You knew just what to do, you played the game well
Just one kiss from you and that’s when I fell

So many signs you gave along the way
I always knew you’d come back some day

(Chorus:)
I’ve got a new love now
And she really turns me on
I’ve got a new love now baby
Since you’ve been gone
I’ve been lost and found
And I thank you everyday
For leaving me this way
Na-na-na-na-hey

(Bridge:)
I just want to let you know
Baby, that’s the way it goes
No time for lies
It’s over now
Let’s just say goodbye

(Chorus:)
I’ve got a new love now
And she really turns me on
I’ve got a new love now baby
Since you’ve been gone

OOOH yeah
I’ve got a new love now
And she really turns me on
I’ve got a new love now baby
Since you’ve been gone
I’ve been lost and found
And I thank you everyday
For leaving me this way
Na-na-na-na-hey
Na-na-na-na-hey
Na-na-na-na-hey
I’ve got a new love baby
Na-na-na-na-hey
I’ve got a new love baby
Na-na-na-na-hey
Na-na-na-na-hey
Na-na-na-na-hey
Na-na-na-na-hey
Na-na-na-na-hey
Na-na-na-na-hey
Na-na-na-na-hey
Na-na-na-na-hey
Na-na-na-na-hey
Na-na-na-na-hey
Na-na-na-na-hey
Na-na-na-na-hey
