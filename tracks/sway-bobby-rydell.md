When marimba rhythms start to play
Dance with me, make me sway
Like the lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more

Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance, you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me

Other dancers may be on the floor
I got eyes to see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway, I grow weak

I can hear the sound of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now

Like the lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more

When we dance, you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me

Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway, I grow weak

I can hear that sound of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now

Make me thrill as only you know how
Come on and sway me now
