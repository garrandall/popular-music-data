Would you like to know a secret
Just between you and me
I don't know where I'm goin' next
Don't know where I'm gonna be

That's another side to this life
I've been leadin'
That's another side to this life

I think I'll go to Nashville
Down to Tennessee
The ten cent life, I've been leading here
Is gonna be the death of me

But that's another side to this life
I've been leadin'
But that's another side to this life

I don't know what I'm doing half the time
I don't know where I'll go
I think I'll get me a sailin' boat
And sail the Gulf of Mexico

But that's another side to this life
I've been leadin'
But that's another side to this life

My whole world's in an uproar
My whole world's upside down
I don't know what I'm doin' here
But I'm always hangin' round

And that's another side to this life
I've been leadin'
And that's another side to this life

Would you like to know a secret
Just between you and me
Don't know where I'm goin' next
Don't know where I'm gonna be

And that's the other side to this life
I've been leadin'
And that's the other side of this life
