Well, it's a hula hoop
I never seem to want to do
The stroll anymore
And western movies really
Are becoming a bore
Cause now I discovered
There's a new way to swing
I'm getting all my kicks
In a big brown ring

I got a hula hoop
I got a hula hoop
I do the hoopa hoola
Hoopa hoola
Hoopa hoola
Hoola all the time

Early in the morning
We all doing the hoola
Walking down the street
On our way to school-a
The teachers are saying
That we're acting like fool-a
They really ought to try it
Cause it's real, real cool-a

The hula hoop
I got a hula hoop
I do the hoopa hoola
Hoopa hoola
Hoopa hoola
Hoola all the time

I never seem to want to do
The stroll anymore
And western movies really
Are becoming a bore
Cause now I discovered
There's a new way to swing
I'm getting all my kicks
In a big brown ring

I got a hula hoop
I got a hula hoop
I do the hoopa hoola
Hoopa hoola
Hoopa hoola
Hoola all the time

I do the hoopa hoola
Hoopa hoola
Hoopa hoola
Hoola all the time
I do the hoopa hoola
Hoopa hoola
Hoopa hoola...
