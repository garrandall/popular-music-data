Black dress with the tights underneath
I got the breath of a last cigarette on my teeth
And she’s an actress (Actress), but she ain’t got no need
She’s got money from her parents in a trust fund back East
T—t—t—tongues always pressed to your cheeks
While my tongue is on the inside of some other girl’s teeth
You tell your boyfriend (Boyfriend), if he says he’s got beef
That I’m a vegetarian and I ain’t fucking scared of him


She wants to touch me, woah-oh
She wants to love me, woah-oh
She’ll never leave me, woah-oh, woah-oh, oh-oh
Don’t trust a ho, never trust a ho
Won’t trust a ho ‘cause the ho won’t trust me
She wants to touch me, woah-oh
She wants to love me, woah-oh
She’ll never leave me, woah-oh, woah-oh, oh-oh
Don’t trust a ho, never trust a ho
Won’t trust a ho ‘cause the ho won’t trust me


Xs on the back of your hands
Washed them in the bathroom to drink like the bands
And the setlist (Setlist) you stole off the stage
Has red and purple lipstick all over the page
Br—br—br—bruises cover your arms
Shaking in the fingers with the bottle in your palm
And the best is (Best is), no one knows who you are
Just another girl alone at the bar


She wants to touch me, woah-oh
She wants to love me, woah-oh
She’ll never leave me, woah-oh, woah-oh, oh-oh
Don’t trust a ho, never trust a ho
Won’t trust a ho ‘cause the ho won’t trust me
She wants to touch me, woah-oh
She wants to love me, woah-oh
She’ll never leave me, woah-oh, woah-oh, oh-oh
Don’t trust a ho, never trust a ho
Won’t trust a ho ‘cause the ho won’t trust me


Shush girl, shut your lips
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips
I said shush girl, shut your lips
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips
I said shush girl, shut your lips
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips


She wants to touch me, woah-oh
She wants to love me, woah-oh
She’ll never leave me, woah-oh, woah-oh, oh-oh
Don’t trust a ho, never trust a ho
Won’t trust a ho ‘cause the ho won’t trust me
She wants to touch me, woah-oh
She wants to love me, woah-oh
She’ll never leave me, woah-oh, woah-oh, oh-oh
Don’t trust a ho, never trust a ho
Won’t trust a ho ‘cause the ho won’t trust me
