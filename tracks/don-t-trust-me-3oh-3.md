Black dress with the tights underneath,


I've been feeling some type of way about her
Wanna wife her
Borderline I dont really like her
Cause she like to play around and she know she got it
In turn and make a kid not really want it
A bad bitch who know she a bad bitch

Worst type in the world if you ask me
Worst thing in the world is emotions
So I'm sitting here trying to go through the motion
Get along but it would be better if we boned
You dont understand, I dont need you honey
I beat my dick like I don't need money
She get around probably fuck yo homie
She text me then she probably gonna text drake
Cause it be the ones man, with the pretty face
I guess it be the moon man who cracked the case


She wants to touch me (Woah),
She wants to love me (Woah),
She'll never leave me (Woah, woah, oh, oh),
Don't trust a ho,
Never trust a ho,
Won't trust a ho,
Won't trust me.

She wants to touch me (Woah),
She wants to love me (Woah),
She'll never leave me (Woah, woah, oh, oh),
Don't trust a ho,
Never trust a ho,
Won't trust a ho,
Won't trust me.


Shes a freshman, with a cup in her hand
She tries her best to pretend she doesnt know who I am
Her and her bestfriend, I seen em pull up they skirts
They got a wagger to see who can hook up with me first
The threesome, like you aint done it before
Oh youre a good girl, from high in his port
Well tell your boyfriend, if he even exists
He shouldnt trust you, because I'm stealing his bitch


Hey hater, sign language
Middle finger, middle finger
Let me tell you now
Intergalactical
I see them rockin the pole
I see them 3 0 4
