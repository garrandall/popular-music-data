Y'all just love me for my lifestyle, baby
Y'all just love me for my lifestyle, uh
Y'all just love me for my

Rock star lifestyle might not give up
Wake up everyday next to different bitches
Now I'm still thinking 'bout the times I was wit' ya
Used to see me broke, now you looking at me lit up
Rock star lifestyle might not give up
Wakin' up next to different bitches
Nine times out of ten I probably won't miss her
Niggas want the juice so they movin' like Bishop

Elliante got me iced out, yeah, yeah
I ain't nothin' like a rapper, I'm a artist
Hundred for a show is light now, light-light
And I need my money right now, swear to God, yeah
Fuck a forty, with a knife I'm crazy
He was frontin', left blood on the pavement
I was never that boy you should play with
That's word to my dawgs, I'ma stay rich
I'm livin' the good life, no complainin' (Complainin', yeah)
Porn stars in my backyard like the slave ship
Took a blue pill, feel like I was in the Matrix (Matrix)
Shit is too real, it get hard for me to fake it

Rock star lifestyle might not give up
Wake up everyday next to different bitches
I'm still thinking 'bout the times I was wit' ya
Used to see me broke, now you looking at me lit up
Rock star lifestyle might not give up
Wakin' up next to different bitches
Nine times out of ten, I probably won't miss her
Niggas want the juice so they movin' like Bishop


Rock star lifestyle, rock star wife, ra-ra
Rock star for real, low life
My balls soon will be a lifetime, hey
Take the Rolls Royce and the Ferrari, bitch is time out
Take the spoon and fuckin' peel his motherfuckin' eyes out
I'm a real mobster, I'm a kind one
I been shinin' out the rough, I'm a diamond
Fuckin' walk inside the club, change climate
Y'all tellin' on each other, pigs rhymin'
Ain't no stories 'round me, we all climbin'
Ain't no subs in the back, I got to find one
'Bout to sign to her pussy with my right hand
Yellow stones in the bracelet like a Sinus
Yeah the dawgs own a 'Ghini the way I signed 'em
I don't know how to keep it, see I mind them
SS to a million because how the way she get on top and ride that like
Oh, woah, Minnesota rider (Girl)
Yeah, I could color all your stones like tie-dye
Yeah, the door will put a stone on your side eye
'Cause I'm sold a million five, yeah, yeah

Rock star lifestyle might not give up (Woah)
Taking out the air, fuck a PullUp
You stabbed me, gang death, girl good luck
Welcome y'all to Barbie life
Rock star lifestyle might not give up (Woah)
I just bought a Range with a green butter guts
Put some Forgiattos on a pickup truck
Air the Bronco out, in Colorado


Rock star lifestyle might not give up (Hey, woah)
Wake up everyday next to different bitches (Bitches)
I'm still thinking 'bout the times I was wit' ya (Wit' ya)
Used to see me broke, now you looking at me lit up
Rock star lifestyle might not give up
Wakin' up next to different bitches
Nine times out of ten, I probably won't miss her (Yeah)
Niggas want the juice so they movin' like Bishop


Rock star lifestyle might not give up (Woah)
Taking out the air, fuck a pull-up
You stabbed me, gang death, girl good luck
Welcome y'all to Barbie life
Rock star lifestyle might not give up (Woah)
I just bought a range with a green butter guts
Just a Forgiatto on a pickup truck
Air the Bronco out, in Colorado
Hey-hey
