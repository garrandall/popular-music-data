I spend my time
Thinkin' 'bout you constantly
It's true that I want you
You're the meaning of success to me 
Cause anything you want
You can get from me
Don't try to work it out
Just let it be
Emotion has no price
And love is free 
I've been going round in circles
You're always on my mind
I need you so bad
It's driving me out of my mind
Reflected in your eyes
Can't you see
You and I against the world
Young lions roam free
You're always taking me somewhere
That I've never seen 
No matter where you go
I'm with you
Every step of the way
No matter what you need
I've got more every single day
My heart is full for you
And I'm longing to find you 
Every step of the way
I'm with you
Every step of the way
I'm right beside you
Cause anything you want
You can get from me
Don't try to work it out
Just let it be
Emotion has no price
And love is free 
It's free and no matter where you go
I'm with you
Every step of the way
No matter what you need
I've got more every single day
My heart is full for you
In your shadow you'll find me 
Every step of the way
I'm with you
Every step of the way
I'm right beside you 
No matter what you do
No matter what you say
I'm right beside you 
Every single day
No matter what you do
Or who you do it to
No matter where you've been
No matter what you say
Or who you say it to
No matter what you do
I will stay close to you
Every step of the way
Every single day
Every step of the way
