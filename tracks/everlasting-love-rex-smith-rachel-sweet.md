Hearts go astray
Leaving hurt when they go
I went away
Just when you needed me so


Finding your way
You come back wanting me
I'm gonna stay
Loving you endlessly


Open up your eyes
Then you'll realize
Here I stand with my
Everlasting love
Need you by my side
There's no need to hide
You'll never be denied
Everlasting love


Look in my eyes
See my love burning strong
No more goodbyes
In your arms I belong, baby

Our time has come
All my dreams have come true, darlin'
[Both}
Two hearts as one
Lovin' me, lovin' you


Open up your eyes
Then you'll realize
Here I stand with my
Everlasting love
Need you by my side
There's no need to hide
You'll never be denied
Everlasting love


From the very start
We'll open up our hearts
We'll be a lasting part of
Everlasting


Where life's really flows
No one really knows

'Till someone's there to
Show the way to everlasting love

Like the sun it shines
Endlessly it shines

You always will be mine
Everlasting love


When other loves are gone
Ours will still be strong
We'll have our very own
Everlasting love

Open up your eyes
Then you'll realize
Here I stand with my
Everlasting love
Need you by my side
There's no need to hide
You'll never be denied
Everlasting love


From the very start
We'll open up our hearts
We'll be a lasting part of
Everlasting love


Open up your eyes
Then you'll realize
Here I stand with my
Everlasting love
Need you by my side
There's no need to hide
You'll never be denied
Everlasting love


From the very start
We'll open up our hearts
We'll be a lasting part of
Everlasting love


Open up your eyes
Then you'll realize
Here I stand with my
Everlasting love
Need you by my side
There's no need to hide
You'll never be denied
Everlasting love
