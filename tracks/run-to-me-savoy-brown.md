Lord knows I try, to do what's right
One whole long year I stayed home both day and night
'Cause I smell-a, hmmm, trouble, way over yonder way up there ahead of me
Yes, worries and troubles, Lord, they just won't let me be

People talk about me, both night and day
I said, "Lord, please forgive them and go the other way"
'Cause I smell-a, hmmm, trouble, Lord, I smell trouble ahead of me
Yes, worries and troubles, Lord, they just won't let me be

And from now on, I will not run and hide
I'll face trouble with s smile, and hope it pass me by
'Cause I smell-a, hmmm, trouble, way over yonder way up there ahead of me
Yes, worries and troubles, they just won't, they just won't, they just won't let me be
Oh yeah
