They come from every state to find
Some dreams were meant to be declined
Tell the man what did you have in mind
What have you come to do?
No turning water into wine
No learning while you're in the line
I'll take you to the broken sign
You see these lights are blue
Come and get it
Lost it at the city limit
Say goodbye, cause they
Will find a way to trip it
Everybody's looking for a silly gimmick
Got to get away
Can't take it for another minute
This town is made of many things
Just look at what the current brings
So high it's almost promising
This place was made on you


Tell me baby
What's your story?
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
Tell me lover
Are you lonely?
The thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh
Tell me baby
What's your story
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
You're so lovely
Are you lonely?
Giving up on the innocence you left behind


Some claim to have the fortitude
Too shrewd to blow the interlude
Sustaining pain to set the mood
Step out to be renewed
I'll move you like a baritone
Jungle brother's on the microphone
Getting over with the undertone
It's time to turn to stone
Chitty chitty baby
When your nose is in the nitty gritty
Life can be a little sweet
But life can be a little shitty
What a pity
Boston and a Kansas City
Looking for a hundred
But you only ever found a fifty
Three fingers in the honeycomb
You ring just like a xylophone
Devoted to the chromosome
The day that you left home


Tell me baby
What's your story?
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
Tell me lover
Are you lonely?
The thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh
Tell me baby
What's your story
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
You're so lovely
Are you lonely?
Giving up on the innocence you left behind
Tell me baby
What's your story?
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
Tell me lover
Are you lonely?
The thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh
Tell me baby
What's your story
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
You're so lovely
Are you lonely?
Giving up on the innocence you left behind
