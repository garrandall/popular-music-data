Attack of the name game
Attack of the name game

I was walkin' down the street keepin' time with my feet
When I heard the strangest sound
I saw a spaceship scene and a man in green
And a crowd was gathered 'round

Well, I stepped up close just to get a little dose
Of his rhymin' kind of game
Then he winked all three of eyes at me
And he said, "Did you catch my name"

It's Clack it back, I gotta Clack attack
I gotta Clee Cly Cloe the Clack a jack
Turn the Tyde, you gotta move the Myde
You gotta wham-bam funkify the Fyde with Clyde

I said, "Hey, Clyde, you're sure outside
Your rap is truly meaner
Now try some more," he said "For sure
Come on, let do Tina"

Tack it back, I gotta Tack attack
I gotta Tee Ty Toe the Tack a jack
Turn the Tina, gotta move the Mina
Gotta wham-bam funkify the Fina, Tina

Well, how 'bout Stevie
(That's easy)

Stack it back, I gotta Stack attack
I gotta Stee Sty Stoe the Stack a jack
Turn the Tevie, gotta move the Mevie
Gotta wham-bam funkify the Fevie, Stevie

Oh.. but can you do Shirley
(Why surely)

Shack it back, I gotta Shack attack
I gotta Shee Shy Shoe the Shack a jack
Turn the Tirley, gotta move the Mirley
Gotta wham-bam funkify the Firley, Shirley

Attack of the name game
Attack of the name game

I couldn't believe what he was sayin' to me
This dude sure came on hip (Hey, mama)
His threads were fine and electric lime
Was the color of his ship (Check it out)

And the rhymin' sounds that cat threw down
Were surely from above
And I said, "Why'd you come here Clyde"
And he said, "To spread some love"

I got Slack it back, I gotta Lack attack
I gotta Lee Ly Loe the Lack a jack
Turn the Tove, you gotta move the Move
Gotta wham-bam funkify the Fove with Love

Yeah, I got it
Check this out

Stack it back, I gotta Stack attack
I gotta Stee Sty Stoe the Stack a jack (That's a fact)
Turn the Tacy, gotta move the Macy
Gotta wham-bam funkify the Facy, my name is Stacy
Well, can you picture that (Right where it's at)

Now we got it, try and see
If you can do some names with me
How about Slick Rick

Slack it back, I gotta Slack attack
I gotta Slee Sly Sloe the Slack a jack
Turn the Tick Rick, gotta move the Mick Rick
Gotta wham-bam funkify the Fick Rick, Slick Rick

(I said who is this little dude)

Hey, big sis give me a shot
And I'mma gonna show you just what I got

Jack is back, I gotta Jack attack
I gotta Jee Jy Joe the Jack a jack (Get back)
Turn the Terry, gotta move the Merry
Gotta wham-bam funkify the Ferry, Jerry

Attack of the name game (You better lock up your daughter)
Attack of the name game (I'll make her do what she hadn't oughta)

(I said yo', I gotta go)
(But there's one more thing I want you to know)
(Now everybody come and take a chance)
(And all get down on this spaceman dance)

(Shooby doo bop, shooby doo wop)
(Shooby dooby dooby doo wop)
(Shooby doo bop, shooby doo wop)
(Shooby dooby dooby doo wop)

(Dooby dooby dooby dooby doo wop)
(Dooby dooby dooby doo wop)

(You're lookin' good)
(Now, now put your left foot down)
(Now put your other left foot down)
(Now put your right foot down)
(Now put your good foot down)
(And walk like this)
(Well, get down earthlings, get down)
(Now put all three hands together and clap)
(Good, a good God)
(Check it out, hey)
(Gotta split, baby)
(Goodbye)
