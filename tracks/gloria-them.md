Like to tell ya about my baby
You know she comes around
She about five feet four
From her head to the ground
You know she comes around here
At just about midnight
She make ya feel so good, Lord
She make ya feel all right
And her name is G-L-O-R-I
G-L-O-R-I-A (GLORIA)
G-L-O-R-I-A (GLORIA)
I'm gonna shout it all night (GLORIA)
I'm gonna shout it everyday (GLORIA)
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
She comes around here
Just about midnight
Ha, she make me feel so good, Lord
I wanna say she make me feel alright
Comes a-walkin' down my street
When she comes to my house
She knocks upon my door
And then she comes in my room
Yeah, and she make me feel alright
G-L-O-R-I-A (GLORIA)
G-L-O-R-I-A (GLORIA)
I'm gonna shout it all night (GLORIA)

Looks so good (GLORIA) alright
Just so good (GLORIA) alright, yeah
