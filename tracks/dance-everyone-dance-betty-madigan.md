Dance everyone dance
Betty Madigan

Over the valley voices are singing
Bells are a ringing
Dance everyone dance
Come to the valley
Run through the clover
Harvest is over
Dance everyone dance

Dance where the corn was high
Under a full moon sky
Dance where the wine was born
Dance everyone dance

Whirl and turnabout
Lift up your arms and shout
Join hands and skip along
Dance everyone dance

Turn left, turn right, hold tight
Lift your feet your heart will follow
Lift your voice till they holler
Lift your wings like the swallow
Fly away, free today
Dance, dance everybody dance

Dance, dance, dance, dance
Repeat from 2nd verse twice
Everybody dance
