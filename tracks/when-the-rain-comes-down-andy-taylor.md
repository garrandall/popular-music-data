There's a change of heart
And you're in a race
And you don't know where it ends
In another world
Where you're upside down
Trying to make amends

Whoa, I don't believe what I see and I hear
Whoa, I can't explain what is here but it's here

Whoa, when the rain comes down
When the rain comes down

Time to start with a different face
I gotta get out of here
I'll take my chance
In a different place
Now my mind is clear
Whoa,I don't believe what I see and I hear
Whoa, I can't explain what is here but it's here
Whoa
