Some girls love to run around
Love to handle everything they see
But my girl has more fun around
And you know she'd rather be with me
Me oh my (Me oh my), lucky guy is what I am
Tell you why, you'll understand
She don't fly although she can

Some boys (Some boys) love to run around
They don't think about the things they do
But this boy (This boy) wants to settle down
And you know he'd rather be with you
Me oh my, lucky guy is what I am
Tell you why, you'll understand
She don't fly although she can

(Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba-ba, ba)
(Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba-ba, ba)
(Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba-ba, ba)
(Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba-ba, ba)

Some girls (Some girls) love to run around
Love to handle everything they see
But my girl (My girl) has more fun around
And you know she'd rather be with
Yes, she'd rather be with
You know she'd rather be with me

(Ra-pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa, pa)
You know she'd rather be with me (Pa, pa, pa, pa)
(Ra-pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa, pa)
You know she'd rather be with me (Pa, pa, pa, pa)
(Ra-pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa, pa)
You know she'd rather be with me (Pa, pa, pa, pa)
(Ra-pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa, pa)
