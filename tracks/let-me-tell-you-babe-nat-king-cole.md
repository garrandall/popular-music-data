Let me tell you, babe
You got me crazy
You got your head in
Those big white clouds

Let me tell you, babe
You got me crazy
You don't know, girl
What life's all about

Let me tell you, babe
You must be dreaming
The world ain't spinning
Just for you alone

Let me tell you, babe
You must be dreaming
'Cause it's rough, girl
Out there on your own

And love that's worth your salt
Don't grow on trees
It won't show upon
Every breeze that blows

It beats me, honey
How your eyes don't see
They just don't see what's
Right in front of your nose

Let me tell you, babe
You just ain't thinking
The grass ain't greener
On that side of town

Let me tell you, babe
You know I need you
If you stay, girl
I won't let you down

(Let me tell you, babe)
If you stay, girl
(Let me tell you, babe)
I won't let you down

(Let me tell you, babe)
If you stay, girl
(Let me tell you, babe)
I won't let you down
