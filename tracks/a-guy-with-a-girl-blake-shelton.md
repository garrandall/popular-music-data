Sometimes I'm the guy with the boys kicking it back
Or the guy with the guitar singing on a country track
I might be the guy with an ice cold can, stirring up dust on some old farmland
When I walk into the party with you girl, you change all that

I'm just the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like "ain't she beautiful?"
I'm invisible but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they're seein'
But I don't mind being the guy with the girl, no

It's funny watchin' 'em do the way they do
They come walkin' up to me but they only wanna talk to you
And I don't blame 'em that they're hypnotized
They keep staring at your heartbreak eyes
It's like their heart starts stoppin' when you come walkin' into the room

And I turn into the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like "ain't she beautiful?"
I'm invisible but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they're seein'
But I don't mind being the guy with the girl

The guy that don't know how he got her
But he ain't never gonna let her, never gonna let her go
Woah-oh, yeah

I'm just the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like "ain't she beautiful?"
I'm invisible but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they're seein'
But I don't mind being the guy with the girl

(Guy with the girl)
No, I don't mind being the guy with the girl
(Guy with the girl)
Yeah, I'm just the guy with the girl
I'm always the guy with the girl
I don't mind it, baby
I don't mind it, baby
I'm always the guy with the girl
