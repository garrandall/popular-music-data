Make me feel like paradise
Give me what I'm missing
Send me to the highest heights
Take me up and away

I've tasted love so many times
With something always missing
But I know that you got the kind
To take me up and away

I know that our journey
Will be filled with passion, love and pleasure
Touching down where only
Satisfactionâs guaranteed
We won't let our feelings
Auto pilot perfect navigation
Sending us to love bliss
Like no one ever knew could be

Make me feel like paradise
Fill me with your kisses
Make the moment feel just right
Take me up and away

'Cause I have waited all my life / Flying high
For the one worth giving / Love sky high
And I don't have to think twice / Flying high
Let's go up and away


Love light in flight
Fuel injection passion


 - Flying high, love sky high

We need just to feel it
To know that our loving has the power
Showing that these feelings
Emanate from you and me
With love high aviation
We will fly forever and one hour
Giving us the always
To live out all our fantasies

Make me feel like paradise
Give me what I'm missing
Send me to the highest heights
Take me up and away

I've tasted love so many times / Flying high
With something always missing / Love sky high
But I know that you got the kind / Flying high
To take me up and away
