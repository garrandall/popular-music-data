Make me feel like paradise
Give me what I'm missing
Send me to the highest heights
Take me up and away
I've tasted love so many times
With something always missing
But I know that you got the kind
To take me up and away

I know that our journey
Will be filled with passion, love and pleasure
Touching down where only
Satisfactionâ€™s guaranteed
We won't let our feelings
Auto-pilot perfect navigation
Sending us to love bliss
Like no one ever knew could be

Oh, make me feel like paradise
Fill me with your kisses
Make the moment feel just right
Take me up and away
Because I have waited all my life (Flying high)
For the one worth giving (Love sky high)
And I don't have to think twice (Flying high)
Let's go up and away


Love's light in flight, mmm-hmm
Fuel injection passion (Flying high)
Love's light in flight (Love sky high)
Fuel injection passion


We need just to feel it
To know that our loving has the power
Showing that these feelings
Emanate from you and me
With love high aviation
We will fly forever and one hour
Giving us the always
To live out all our fantasies


Make me feel like paradise
Give me what I'm missing, yeah
Send me to the highest heights
Take me up and away
I've tasted love so many times
With something always missing, yeah
