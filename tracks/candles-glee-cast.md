The power lines went out
And I am all alone
But I don't really care at all
Not answering my phone

All the games you played
The promises you made
Couldn't finish what you started
Only darkness still remains

Lost sight
Couldn't see
When it was you and me
Blow the candles out
Looks like a solo tonight
I'm beginning to see the light
Blow the candles out
Looks like a solo tonight
But I think I'll be alright

Been black and blue before
There's no need to explain
I am not the jaded kind
Playback's such a waste

You're invisible
Invisible to me
My wish is coming true
Erase the memory of your face
Lost sight
Couldn't see
When it was you and me
Blow the candles out
Looks like a solo tonight
I'm beginning to see the light
Blow the candles out
Looks like a solo tonight
But I think I'll be alright

One day
You will wake up
With nothing but your sorries
And someday
You will get back
Everything you gave me
Blow the candles out
Looks like a solo tonight
I'm beginning to see the light

Blow the candles out (The candles out)
Looks like a solo tonight (Solo tonight)
But I think I'll be alright
