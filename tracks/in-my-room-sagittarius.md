There's something you should know


Yeah, It's intermission time again
I'm about 2 bottles of Merlot in
I go by a couple names
My mom calls me Dom
And I know you been waitin
Wonderin when we was comin back
Cause I know it gets lonely when I'm not around
But we had to perfect the sound
Tell Em


Yeah, Your now tuned into the smooth sounds of
The Los Angeles Unified Sound District
Comin to you from, the West with Love
My name is Lazy Lou and I'm a Sagittarius
Can ya dig it?

Yea, it's ya boy Polyester, Libra


There's something you should know
Before we go and play
That baby tonite
You can't stay
So GO
You should go girl
So GO... Now
You should go girl
