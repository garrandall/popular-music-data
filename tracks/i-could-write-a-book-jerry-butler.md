I could write a book
About the way you hurt me
About you left me now
And filled my heart with misery

You could have made the chapter
The one I was after
Filled the whole book with laughter
But, girl, you chose to go
I don't know why

Heaven knows I could write a script
About how you changed my life
The script would be so hip
It might even win a prize

Girl, you've been a life line
A once in a lifetime love affair
But you didn't read it
To see what it needed
I don't believe you ever cared

I'm gonna make me a play
About how you went away
And said you were going to stray

The play would make Broadway
And I bet it would run
For about a thousand days

Cause people would say
You misused, Lord, you abused me
The whole world would see
That I love you alone

Hey, you walked off the stage
In such a rage
I wonder what in the world
Did I do wrong

I'm gonna make me a movie
And it's gonna be so groovy
My name would be filled to the brim
People would say, take a look at him

There he stands with a broken heart
You're gonna have a real heavy part
People will be in the audience crying tears
They're gonna make it the reel of the year

I know it's gonna get a nomination
Girl, cause you're getting a standing ovation
You really turn me on...
