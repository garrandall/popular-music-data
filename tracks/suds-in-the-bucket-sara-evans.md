She was in the backyard
Say it was a little past nine
When her prince pulled up
A white pick-up truck

Her folks should've seen it comin'
It was only just a matter of time
Plenty old enough
And you can't stop love

She stuck a note on the screen door
"Sorry but I got to go"
That was all she wrote
Her mama's heart was broke
That was all she wrote
So the story goes

Now her daddy's in the kitchen
Starin' out the window
Scratchin' and a rackin' his brains
How could 18-years just up and walk away

Our little pony-tailed girl
Grown up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin' out on the line

Now don't you wonder
What the preacher's gonna preach about Sunday morn
Nothin' quite like this
Has happened here before

Well he must have been a looker
Smooth talkin' son of a gun
For such a grounded girl
To just up and run
Course you can't fence time
And you can't stop love

Now all the biddies in the beauty shop
Gossip goin' non-stop
Sippin' on pink lemonade
How could 18-years just up and walk away

Our little pony-tailed girl grown up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin' out on the line

She's got her pretty little bare feet hangin' out the window
And they're headin' up to Vegas tonight
How could 18-years just up and walk away

Our little pony-tailed girl grown up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin' out on the line

She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin' out on the line

She was in the backyard
Say it was a little past nine
When her prince pulled up
A white pick-up truck
Plenty old enough,
And you can't stop love,
And no you can't fence time
And you can't stop love.
