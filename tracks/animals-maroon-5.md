Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm... (Hey)


So what you trying to do to me? (Hey)
It's like we can't stop, we're enemies (Hey)
But we get along when I'm inside you, yeah (Hey)
You're like a drug that's killing me (Hey)
I cut you out entirely (Hey)
But I get so high when I'm inside you


Yeah, you can start over, you can run free (Hey)
You can find other fish in the sea (Hey)
You can pretend it's meant to be (Hey)
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound (Hey)
Taking me down, rolling on the ground (Hey)
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh (Hey)


Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm... (Hey)


So if I run, it's not enough (Hey)
You're still in my head, forever stuck (Hey)
So you can do what you wanna do, yeah (Hey)
I love your lies, I'll eat 'em up (Hey)
But don't deny the animal (Hey)
That comes alive when I'm inside you


Yeah, you can start over, you can run free (Hey)
You can find other fish in the sea (Hey)
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound (Hey)
Taking me down, rolling on the ground (Hey)
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh (Hey)


Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...


Don't tell no lie, lie, lie, lie
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No girl don't lie, lie, lie, lie (No, no, don't lie)
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny (You can't deny)
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals (Hey, hey)
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals, oww!
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)


Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...


Don't tell no lie, lie, lie, lie
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No girl don't lie, lie, lie, lie (No, no, don't lie)
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny (You can't deny)
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah
