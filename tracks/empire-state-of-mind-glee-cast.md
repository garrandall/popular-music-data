Yeah
Yeah, I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere


I used to cop in Harlem – all of my Dominicanos
Right there up on Broadway, pull me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen like a Simmons with them pastries


Cruisin' down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me, I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say what up to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside, Knicks & Nets give me high five
Jigga, I be spiked out, I could trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from...


In New York (Ayy, aha)
Concrete jungle (Yeah) where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (Yeah)
Now you're in New York (You're in New York) (Aha, aha, aha)
These streets will make you feel brand-new (New)
Big lights will inspire you (Come on)
Let's hear it for New York (You're welcome, OG)
New York, New York (I made you hot, jigga)


Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Dude, I made the Yankee hat more famous then a Yankee can
You should know I bleed Blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of brothers walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the meltin' pot, corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambaataa, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners it ain't for they act like they forgot how to act


Eight million stories out there in the naked
City, it's a pity half of y'all won't make it
Me? I gotta plug, Special Ed "I Got It Made"
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwayne Wade
Three dice Cee Lo, three card Molly
Labor Day Parade – rest in peace Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
Long live the Kingdom – I'm from the Empire State that's...


In New York (ayy) (yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (That boy good) (You can't do)
Now you're in New York (You're in New York)
(Welcome to the bright lights, baby)
These streets will make you feel brand-new (Rachel: New, brand-new)
Big lights will inspire you (Rachel: oh, oh)
Let's hear it for New York
New York, New York (Rachel: yeah)


Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick, the side lines is
Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
Then gradually become worse – don't bite the apple, Eve!
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in style
End of the winter gets cold, en vogue, with your skin out
City of sin is a pity on the whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them


Mami took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
"Hail Mary" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
Dub, MHS got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien


In New York (in, in, uh) (Mercedes: yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of (Mercedes: made)
There's nothin' you can't do (Mercedes: you can't do)
Now you're in New York (Rachel: You're in New York) (Mercedes: yeah, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new (Mercedes: new)
Big lights will inspire you (Mercedes: you)
Let's hear it for New York
New York (Mercedes: New York), New York (Rachel: yeah)


One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty
No place in the world that could compare
Put your lighters in the air
Everybody say, "Yeah, yeah"
"Yeah, yeah"


In New York (New York)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of (oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York (New York, New York)
These streets will make you feel brand-new (Brand-new)
Big lights will inspire you (Inspire you)
Let's hear it for New York (New York)
New York (New York), New York (New York)
