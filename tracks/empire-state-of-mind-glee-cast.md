Yeah Iâm out that Brooklyn, now Iâm down in Tribeca
Right next to Deniro, but Iâll be hood forever
Iâm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem, all of my Dominicanoâs
Right there up on Broadway, pull me back to that McDonaldâs
Took it to my stashbox, 560 State Strett
Catch me in the kitchen like a Simmons with them pastries

Cruisinâ down 8th Street, off white Lexus
Drivinâ so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me, Iâm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say whatup to Ty-Ty, still sippinâ mai taiâs
Sittinâ courtside, Knicks & Nets give me high five
Nigga I be Spikeâd out, I could trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that Iâm most definitely from

New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
Thereâs nothinâ you canât do
Now youâre in New York (new york!)
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Letâs hear it for New York, New York, New York

Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Do I made the Yankee hat more famous then a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ainât a Crip though
But I got a gang of brothers walkinâ with my clique though
Welcome to the melting pot, corners where we sellinâ rock
Africa Bambata home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners it ainât for they act like they forgot how to act
Eight million stories, out there in it naked
City is a pity, half of yâall wonât make it
Me, I got a plug, Special Ed âI Got It Madeâ
If Jesus payinâ Lebron, Iâm payinâ Dwayne Wade
Three dice cee-lo, three card molly
Labour Day Parade, rest in peace Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
Long live the Kingdom, Iâm from the Empire St. thatâs

New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
Thereâs nothinâ you canât do
Now youâre in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Letâs hear it for New York, New York, New York

Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick
The sidelines is, lined with casualties, who sip to life casually
Then gradually become worse, donât bite the apple leaf
Caught up in the in-crowd, now youâre in style
End of the winter gets cold, en vogue, with your skin out
City of sin, itâs a pity on the wind
Good girls gone bad, the cityâs filled with them

Mommy took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
Hail Mary to the city, youâre a virgin
And Jesus canât save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelinâ like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien

New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
Thereâs nothinâ you canât do
Now youâre in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Letâs hear it for New York, New York,
New York

One hand in the air for the big city
Streetlights, big dreams, all lookinâ pretty
No place in the world that could compare
Put your lighters in the air
Everybody say âYeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeahâ

New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
Thereâs nothinâ you canât do
Now youâre in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Letâs hear it for New York, New York, New York
