As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom


Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?


Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you — a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom


Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?


You've been hit by—
You've been hit by—
A Smooth Criminal


So they came in to the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Every time I tried to find him
There were no clues, they’re behind him
And they end up never knowing
Who’s the suspect or what to expect
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidation


Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
Annie, are you okay? Are you okay?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?


Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you — a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom


Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?


You've been hit by—
You've been struck by—
A Smooth Criminal


Okay, I want everybody to clear the area right now!


Annie, are you okay? (I don't know)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (I don't know)
There's a sound at the window (I don't know)
Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie? (I don't know)
He came into your apartment (I don't know)
Left bloodstains on the carpet (I don't know why, baby)
And then you ran into the bedroom (Help me)
You were struck down
It was your doom Annie (Dag gone it)
Annie are you okay? (Dag gone it-baby)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (Dag gone it-baby)
There's a sound at the window (Dag gone it-baby)
Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie
He came into your apartment, (Dag gone it)
Left bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down (Dag gone it)
It was your doom Annie
