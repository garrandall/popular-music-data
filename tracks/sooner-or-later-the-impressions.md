You know this morning when the phone rang
I knew something was wrong
You know that funny feeling you get sometimes
Sure enough it was your girl friend on the phone
And she told me that
She said you had a fight when you got home last night
You know it hurt me so doggone bad
Because I love you so much
I love you so much
But you and I both knew that...

Sooner or later
It had to happen girl
Sooner or later
It had to happen girl

If you do wrong
You know someday (Someday baby)
You're gonna have to pay
We knew it

Sooner or later
It had to happen girl
Sooner or later
It had to happen girl

We knew we'd have to face that lie (Someday baby)
'Cause he found out about you and I

Sooner or later
It had to happen girl
Sooner or later
It had to happen girl

We couldn't go on leanin' on a talk
We couldn't go on siftin' on a rock
We couldn't go on
Can't you see girl
We live in a small small world

Sooner or later
It had to happen girl
You see girl yeah
If you do wrong you got to pay (Yes you do girl)
Just like the Grateful Dead

Didn't mean to do nobody wrong
But I love you too much
It's so damn strong
Ohbaby, it's plain to see
From now on it's you and me

Sooner or later
It had to happen girl
Sooner or later
It had to happen girl

Sooner or later...
