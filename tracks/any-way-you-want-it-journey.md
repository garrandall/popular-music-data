Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it


She loves to laugh
She loves to sing
She does everything
She loves to move
She loves to groove
She loves the loving things


Oh, all night
All night
Oh, every night
So hold tight
Hold tight
Oh, baby, hold tight
Oh, she said


Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
She said, Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it


I was alone
I never knew
What good love could do
Oh, then we touched
Then we sang
About the loving things


Oh, all night
All night
Oh, every night
So hold tight
Hold tight
Oh baby, hold tight
Oh, she said


Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
I said, any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it




She said oh
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on


Oh, she said any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
(Any way) Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it


Oh, she said any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it


Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it


(Any way) Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
(Any way) Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it


(Any way) Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
(Any way) Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
