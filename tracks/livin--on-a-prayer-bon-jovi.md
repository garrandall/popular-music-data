Tommy used to work on the docks
Unions been on strike
He's down on his luck... it's tough, so tough
Gina works the diner all day
Workin' for her man, she brings home her pay
For love, oh for love

She says we've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other, and that's a lot
For love, we'll give it a shot

Whooah, we're halfway there
Oh livin on a prayer
Take my hand, and we'll make it I swear
Oh livin on a prayer

Tommy's got his six string in hock
Now he's holding in what he used
To make it talk, so tough, it's tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night
Tommy whispers, baby it's okay, someday
For now

We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other, and that's a lot
For love, we'll give it a shot

Whooah, we're halfway there
Oh livin on a prayer
Take my hand, and we'll make it I swear
Oh livin on a prayer

Kick it Simon!



We've got to hold on ready or not
You live for the fight when it's all that you've got
Whooah, we're halfway there
Oh Livin on a prayer
Take my hand, and we'll make it I swear
Oh Livin on a prayer
Livin on a prayer!
Livin on a prayer!
Livin on a prayer!

Thank you!

Good night!
