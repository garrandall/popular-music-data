Met the girl that I want to get to know a little better
Tonight I'm gonna take her to the picture show
Gonna park in the darkest spot I know
I got a question
That I never asked anybody else before

Hey would you help me make it to my rockin' chair
Love me all of my life
Don't wanna grow old without ya
Don't wanna be out in the cold without ya
No more

Help me make it to my rockin' chair
Been saving my good times for the good
Would you hold me and never ever let me go

I've been told about love for so long
Been left cold without love for so long
Told of disappointments all so wrong
And I can't see me
In tomorrow
Without you beside me

Help me make it to my rockin' chair
Love me all of my life
Don't wanna grow old without ya
Don't wanna be out in the cold without ya
No more

Help me make it to my rockin' chair
Been saving my good times for the good
Would you hold me and never ever let me go

Help me make it to my rockin' chair
Been saving my good times for the good
Would you hold me and never ever let me go

Hey would you help me make it to my rockin' chair
Love me all of my life
Don't wanna grow old without ya
Don't wanna be out in the cold without ya
No more

Help me make it to my rockin' chair
Been saving my good times for the good
Would you hold me and never ever let me go

Help me make it to my rockin' chair
Been saving my good times for the good
Would you hold me and never ever let me go
