Closer...
Closer to me.
Now that i've found you girl.
I'll never let you leave...

Closer...
Closer to me.
I will give you everything.
Your heart will ever need...

Often i have wondered
Could this be true
I've searched my whole life for someone like you
Ooohh someone to make my dreams come true
Is this a fantasy or have my dreams come true

So come closer.
Closer to me.
Now that i've found you girl.
I'll never let you leave.

Come closer.
Closer to me.
I will give you everything.
Your heart will ever need...

Like the high tide in the ocean
Splashes on the beach
Coloring the rocks on shore
Like your love colored me
Oohh i've never felt this way
In my life before
Cuz you've brought out that part of me

That i've learned to adore

Closer.
Closer to me.
Now that i've found you girl.
I'll never let you leave.

Closer.
Closer to me.
I will give you everything.
Your heart will ever need...

You are my everything
You are my hopes my thoughts my wishes and my dreams yeah
As sure as the sun will shine and i'm so glad that you are mine
Will bond your soul and mine our love is one of a kind. whoaaaa

Closer.
Closer to me.
Now that i've found you girl.
I'll never let you leave.

Closer.
Closer to me.
I will give you everything.
Your heart will ever need...

Can't you see can't you see
You are my hopes my thoughts my wishes and my dreams...
