There's a destination a little up the road
From the habitations and the towns we know
A place we saw the lights turn low
The jig-saw jazz and the get-fresh flow
Pulling out jives and jamboree handouts
Two turntables and a microphone
Bottles and cans just clap your hands
Just clap your hands


Where it's at!
I got two turntables and a microphone
Where it's at!
I got two turntables and a microphone
Where it's at!
I got two turntables and a microphone
Where it's at!
I got two turntables and a microphone


(Take me home with my elevator bones!)
(That was a good drum break)
Pick yourself up off the side of the road
With your elevator bones
And your whip-flash tones
Members only hyponotizers
Move through the room like ambulance drivers
Shine your shoes with your microphone blues
Hirsute with your parachute fruits
Passing the dutchie from coast to coast
Like my man Gary Wilson (rocks the most)


Where it's at!
I got two turntables and a microphone
Where it's at!
I got two turntables and a microphone


("What about those who swing both ways? AC-DC's?")
(Let's make it out baby)

Mmm
Cheese

Two turntables and a microphone
Two turntables and a microphone
Two turntables and a microphone
Two turntables and a microphone
Two turntables and a microphone
Two turntables and a microphone
(We're all part of the total scene)


Where it's at!
I got two turntables and a microphone
Where it's at!
I got two turntables and a microphone

Make yourself
(That's beautiful, dad)
Got my microphone


There's a destination a little up the road
From the habitations and the towns we know
A place we saw the lights turn low
The jig-saw jazz and the get-fresh flow
Pulling out jives and jamboree handouts
Two turntables and a microphone
Bottles and cans just clap your hands
Just clap your hands


Where it's at!
I got two turntables and a microphone
Where it's at!
I got two turntables and a microphone

(Make it our baby)
(Make it our baby)
(Let's make it our baby)

Ohhhhhhhhhhh
It's all good
All good
