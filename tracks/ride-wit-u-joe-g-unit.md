Couple pounds in the sack

Thats what I do, just so that she would be mine, I give her all my time, every part of me 
My mind, soul, my body wassup

Ride with ya, ride with ya, I wanna move with ya, move with ya, move with ya, I wanna ride
With ya, ride with ya, ride with ya, I wanna move with ya, move with ya, move with ya, I wanna

Intelectual, matches up with your physical baby

Ice, drop the top and let your head blow back them j.lo jeans girl that ass so fat buck know
