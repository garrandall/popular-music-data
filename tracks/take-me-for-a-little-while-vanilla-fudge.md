I've been trying
To make you love me
But everything I try
Just takes you further from me

You don't love me no no
So you treat me cruel (baby I need you)
But no matter how you hurt me
I'll always be a fool

If you don't want me (forever)
If you don't need me (forever)
And if you don't love me (forever)
(Take me for a little while)
I've got to make you love me
(For a little while)
Just got to make you want me
I've got to stop it

There should be a law (baby I need you)
And no maatter how
You put me down
I love you more

I feel so helpless (baby I need you)
And it ain't funny (you know I need you)
'Cause deep down inside I know
You're never gonna love me

If you don't want me (forever)
If you don't need me (forever)
If you can not love me (forever)
(Take me for a little while)
I've got to make you love me
(For a little while)
I've got to make you want me

(Take me for a little while)
Baby, can't you see
(Take me for a little while)
Yeah, yeah, uh huh
(Take me for a little while)
(Take me for a little while)
(Take me for a little while)
(Take me for a little while)
