I phoned the local station
I kinda like the things they're playing
So I settled down to listen nice and easy
The DJ plays our kind of music
He's asked us folk to choose it
But it all adds up to another
Night without you

Now and then he takes a phone-in
And anyone who's feeling lonely
Can call him up
And make a little conversation
And in the night there's music playing
Soft behind the words he's saying
Would I like to make a dedication

This song I wanna dedicate to you
And to everyone who feels the way we do
As long as you're a part of me
The song will play on endlessly
I hope my dedication's getting through

I'm standing in this lonely city
There's not enough to keep me busy
And we can't meet till I can take
A short vacation
You'll never know how much I love you
Lying here thinking of you
And all I got is a late night music station

This song I wanna dedicate to you
And to everyone who feels the way we do
As long as you're a part of me
The song will play on endlessly
I hope my dedication's getting through
Dedication playing just for you

This song I wanna dedicate to you
And to everyone who feels the way we do
As long as you're a part of me
The song will play on endlessly
I hope my dedication's gettin' through
Dedication's playing just for you
