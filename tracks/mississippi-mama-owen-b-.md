Yeah, now come on
Yeah yeah yeah

Hailing from St. Louis moving down the line
Heading to New Orleans try to open wide
Got my girl waiting got one thing on my mind
Mississippi mama yeah you're outta sight

Mississippi mama never lost her fight

 got to be on time
Hear that whistle blowing yeah so is my mind now
Got my final paycheck this is my last ride
Mississippi mama yeah you're outta sight

Mississippi mama never lost her fight

Yeah

Hailing from St. Louis moving down the line
Heading to New Orleans try to open wide
Got my girl waiting got one thing on my mind
Mississippi mama yeah you're outta sight

Mississippi mama never lost her fight
