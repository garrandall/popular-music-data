Cutie pie
You're the reason why
I love you so
I don't want you to go

You're the girl who makes me feel so good
Cutie pie

Cutie pie
You brighten up my day
It's impossible
For me to stay away

Lately hazy
Girl, I'm goin' 'round
Want you to know
How much I love you so

Lately hazy
Girl, I'm goin' 'round
Want you to see
How much you mean to me

You're the girl who makes me feel so good
Cutie pie
Nothin' but a cutie pie

Cutie pie
You really pick me up
Till I can't
Hardly get enough

You're the girl who makes me feel so good
Cutie pie

Cutie pie
You're the reason why
I'm full of joy
Since you came into my life

Lately hazy
Girl, I'm goin' 'round
Want you to know
How much I love you so

Lately hazy
Girl, I'm goin' 'round
Want you to see
How much you mean to me

You're the girl who makes me feel good
Cutie pie

You're the girl who makes me feel so good
Cutie pie
Nothin' but a cutie pie
Who makes me feel so good
You're my cutie pie

You're the girl who makes me feel so good
Cutie pie

You're nothin' but a cutie pie
Who makes me feel so good
You're my cutie pie

You're the girl who makes me feel good
Cutie pie

You're the girl who makes me feel so good
Cutie pie

You're the girl who makes me feel good
Cutie pie
