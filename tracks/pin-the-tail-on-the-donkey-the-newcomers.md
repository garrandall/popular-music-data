Whoo-oh-oh!
Come on now!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

Whooo-oh!


One day I took you to the zoo
And I did all the tricks for you that the monkeys wouldn't do
(I stood on my head for you)
I played the part of a clown just to have you put me down
But I still love (I love you)


So go ahead, pin the tail on the donkey (Ay-ya-ya!)
Go ahead, girl and call me a fool (Call me a fool!)
Go ahead, pin the tail on the donkey (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause one day the tail will be pinned on you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Go ahead girl!


It started back when we were young
Pigtails and bubblegum
Now it's the junior prom
(All dressed up in ties and tails)
But still you won't dance with me
Leave me standing like a tree 'til time to take you home (I love you)


So go ahead, pin the tail on the donkey (Ay-ya-ya!)
Go ahead, girl and call me a fool (Call me a fool!)
Go ahead, pin the tail on the donkey (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause one day the tail will be pinned on you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Go ahead girl!

Better move!
Better move on!

Baby (baby), baby (baby)
Baby (baby), baby (baby)
Baby (baby), baby (baby)
Oh baby (baby), baby (baby)
Baby (baby), baby (baby)
Baby (baby), baby (baby)
Whoa-oh!

Yeah, yeah!

Yeah girl!
Come on girl!


I lay my heart down at your feet
Hoping someday you'll retreat
And return your love to me
(Love me just a little girl)
I'll wear a dunce-cap on my head
Like it was a crown instead
'Cause I'll always love
(I love you)


So go ahead, pin the tail on the donkey (Come on girl!)
Go ahead, girl and call me a fool (Call me a fool!)
Go ahead, pin the tail on the donkey (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause one day the tail will be pinned on you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Go ahead girl!


So go ahead, pin the tail on the donkey (Girl I love you!)
Go ahead, girl and call me a fool (Call me a fool!)
Go ahead, pin the tail on the donkey (But I do love you)
'Cause one day the tail will be pinned on you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
