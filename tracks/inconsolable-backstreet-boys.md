I close the door
Like so many times, so many times before
Filmed like a scene on the cutting room floor
I wanna let you walk away tonight without a word

I try to sleep, yeah
But the clock is stuck on thoughts of you and me
A thousand more regrets unraveling
OOoh, if you were here right now,
I swear I'd tell you this


Baby, I don't wanna waste another day
Keepin' it inside, it's killing me
Cause all I ever wanted comes right down to you (to you)
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I'ma tell you, every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

I climb the walls, yeah
I can see the edge,
But I can't take the fall, no
I've memorized the number
So why can't I make the call?
Maybe cause I know you'll always be with me
In the possibility



No, no, no

I don't wanna be like this
I just wanna let you know
That everything I hold in
Is everything I can't let go (oh, can't let go)

Cause Baby,



Don't you know it baby
I don't wanna waste another day
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby I'ma tell you, every time you leave
I'm inconsolable

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, I'm inconsolable
Whoaa yeah
I'm inconsolable
