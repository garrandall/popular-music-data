Don't stop dancing to the music
Just let the music make you high
We've got rhythm, you can use it
Don't let this feeling pass you by, by, by

Don't fight the feeling in your soul
Just boogie on back and
Let the good times roll, yeah
We're here to move your soul

Just get on up, yeah
Everybody party, come on
Y'all, let's get started, yeah, yeah

Shake your rump to the funk now
Shake your rump to the funk now
Shake your rump to the funk now
Shake your rump to the funk now
Well, well, well, well

Everybody, keep on moving
Just get on up and do your stuff, yeah, yeah
Everybody, keep on grooving
Moving and grooving is what they all are doing

Come on, everybody, yeah, yeah
Feel this stuff, yeah
We just wanna groove you
Till you get enough, yeah

We want to play for you
Our funky sound, yeah
Move it to the music and
Get down, down, down

Shake your rump to the funk now
Shake your rump to the funk now
Shake your rump to the funk now
Shake your rump to the funk now

Well, well, well
Well, well, well

Shake your rump to the funk, come on and
Come on and, come on and

Shake your rump to the funk
Shake your rump to the funk now
Shake your rump to the funk now
Shake your rump to the funk now

Shake your rump to the funk now
Shake your rump to the funk now
Shake your rump to the funk now
Shake your rump to the funk now
