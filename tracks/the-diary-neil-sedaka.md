Whoa, oh

How I'd like to look
Into that little book
The one that has the lock and key
And know the boy that you care for
The boy who's in your diary

When it's late at night
What is the name you write?
Oh, what I'd give if I could see
Am I the boy that you care for?
The boy who's in your diary

Do you recall
And make note of all
The little things I say and do?
The name you underline
I'm hoping
That it's mine
Darling, I'm so in love with you

Please don't leave me blue
Make all my dreams come true
You know how much you mean to me
Say I'm the boy that you care for
The boy who's in your diary

Whoa, oh

Oh, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo
Whoo
