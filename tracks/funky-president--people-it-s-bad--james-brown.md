Funky town, nasty
Hey, listen to the man
Rap, Godfather
Payback, cold blooded
People, people, we've got to get over
Before we go under, yeah Lord
People, people, we've got to get over
Before we go under
Hey, country, you didn't say what you meant
You just changed, a brand new funky President
Stock market going up, jobs going down
It ain't no funky job to be found
Tax keep going up, I changed from a glass
Now I drink from a paper cup, getting bad
People, people, we've got to get over
Before we go under, listen to me

Let's get together and raise...
Let's get together, get some land
Raise our food like the man
Save our money like the mob
Put up a factory, own the job

Wow, tell them, Godfather
Hey Lord, hey, turn on your funk motor
Get down and praise the Lord
Get sexy, sexy, get funky and dance
Love me baby, love me nice
Don't make it once, but can you make it twice
I like it
People, people, we've got to get over
Before we go under
People, people, well well well
Before we go under
Turn on your funk motor, I know it's tough
Turn on your funk motor until you get enough, yeah
Hey, give yourself a chance to come through
Wow, tell yourself, I can do what you can do

Hey, listen to the man, rap godfather
Pay back, cold blooded
People, people, hey, people, people
People, people, don't you see what's going on?
People, people, we've got to get together
Oh, get on your good foot, huh, change it, yeah

Got to get together and get some land
Raise our food just like the man
Hey... I got to say it again
We got to get together and buy some land
Raise our food just like the man
Save our money, do like the mob
Put up your factory and own the job

We've got to get over, before we go under
Time ain't a jaunt, hey Lord
Country, do you know just what I meant
We just changed
And got a brand new funky President
And hey, I need to be the mayor
So I can change the things around here
I need to be the governor, huh
I need to be the governor, huh
