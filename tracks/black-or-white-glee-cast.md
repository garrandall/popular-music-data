Ouh!
Ouh!
I took my baby
On a saturday bang
Boy is that girl with you
Yes we're one and the same


Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle
Has happened tonight
Hee!
Ah!


But, if
You're thinkin'
About my baby
It don't matter if you're
Black or white


Whoo!
They print my message
In the saturday sun
I had to tell them
I ain't second to none


And I told about equality
And it's true
Either


You're wrong
Or you're right


Whoo!
Ah!


But, if
You're thinkin'
About my baby
It don't matter if you're
Black or white


Hee!


Don't babe!


Hehe!


I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Sew when the
Going gets rough
I ain't scared of
Your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl when the
Goin' gets mean


Protection
For gangs, clubs,
And nations
Causing grief in
Human relations
It's a turf war
On a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides
Of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places
Faces
Where your blood
Comes from
Is where your space is
I've seen the bright
Get duller
I'm not going to spend
My life being a color


Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you
Kicking dirt in my eye


But, if
You're thinkin'
About my baby
It don't matter if you're
Black or white
I said if
You're thinkin' of
Being my baby
It don't matter if you're
Black or white
I said if
You're thinkin' of
Being my brother
It don't matter if you're
Black or white


Yeah yeah yeah!


Whoo!
Black or white!


It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white, whoo
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white
( Yeah yeah yeah!)
It's tough for you to get by
( Black or white!)
It's black , it's white, whoo
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white, whoo
( C'mon!)
It's black, it's white, whoo
( Ah)
( Yeah! Yeah! Yeah)
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white, whoo
It's tough for you to get by
( Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!)
( Oouh!)
