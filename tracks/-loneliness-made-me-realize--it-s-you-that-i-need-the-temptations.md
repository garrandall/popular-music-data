Oh, lonely man am I
Ever since you said goodbye
Girl, I know that I should have woke up
'Cause I see it now that we've broke up
Your farewell kiss is haunting me
My tooting lips cry out constantly
Let your heart, let your heart be your guide
Forget about your foolish pride

Starting tomorrow I keep telling myself
(I need ya; baby, I need ya)
I'm gonna get out and find somebody else
(I need ya; baby, I need ya)
Somebody that's sweet and kind
(I need ya; baby, I need ya)
Who will erase you out of my mind

But tell me, how could I find somebody new, baby?
(It's you that I need)
When my two arms keep reaching out for you?
(It's you that I need)
And my two lips keep right on repeating
It's you that I need (Baby, I need you)

You know that even when I close my eyes to forget ya
I see your face and your memories too
Girl, I've never felt this loneliness before
And oh, girl, I just can't take it no more
Every night a million tears I shed
Girl, next morning going out of my head
Just take a good look and you'll see
What this loneliness is doing to me

Baby, it's you that need
Don't you know that it's you that I need?
Oh, I can't take this loneliness
It's you that I need
Oh baby, I need ya
It's you that I need; baby, I need ya

Some fool I'm gonna be no more
'Cause I'll soon be knocking, knocking on your door
Gonna get down on my bended knees
Beg and plead, girl, come back to me
It's you that I need
(Every night a million tears I shed)
Girl, it's you that I need
(Very soon going out of my head)
Girl, take a good look and you'll see
What does this loneliness is doing to me
