I got the magic stick
I know if I can hit once, I can hit twice
I hit the baddest chicks
Shorty don't believe me, then come with me tonight
And I'll show you magic
(What? What?) Magic (uh huh uh huh)
I got the magic stick



I'm a freak to the core
Get a dose once, you gon' want some more
My tongue touch ya girl, ya toes bound to curl
This exclusive shit I don't share with the world
I have you up early in the mornin, moanin
Back shot, proper or low can't stop us
Been a fiend for this since Rakim made hits
Get the position down pat, then it's time to switch
I'll rock the boat, I'll work the middle
I speed it up, straight beat it up..
.. and I ain't in the hood with my toast out loc'n
I'm in the telly workin up a sweat strokin
Tonight's the night, you can fall in love
You can call your mama right now, tell her you met a thug
I pop a lot of shit cause I can back it up
My left stroke's the death stroke


I got the magic clit
I know if I get licked once, I get licked twice
I am the baddest chick
Shorty you don't believe me, then come with me tonight
And I'll show you magic
(What? What?) Magic, uh huh uh huh
I got the magic clit


Lil' Kim not a hore
But I sex a nigga so good, he gotta tell his boys
When it, come to sex don't test my skills
Cause my head game have you HEAD over heels
Give a nigga the chills, have him pay my bills
Buy matchin Lambo's with the same color wheels...
.. and I ain't out shoppin spendin dudes C-notes
I'm in the crib givin niggas deep throat
Tonight Lil' Kim gon' have you in the zone
Girls, call ya crib, I'm answerin' the phone
Guys wanna wife me 'n' give me the ring
I'll do it anywhere, anyhow,down for anything
Couple of humps, give a nigga goosebumps
This junk in my trunk ain't made for chumps
When Lil' Kim's around you don't need to lie
It's the "Drugs" baby, I'm makin' ya HIGH!



I got the magic stick
I know if I can hit once, I can hit twice
(I give em' the baddest chick
Shorty you don't believe me, then come with me tonight
And I'll show you magic What? What?)
Magic(uh-huh, uh-huh)
(I got the magic clit)



I put your face in it
I know you sprung off in your tongue, I know you tastin it
(Sex ain't a race) But I have a thug nigga breakin records
And the time is (one minute, six seconds)
(Magic stick) I got the magic box
HAVE THAT ASS TRICKIN AFTER ONE BACK SHOT
(The gifts, the ice, I like that a lot)
The minks, the leathers, the CL drop



I got the magic stick
I know if I can hit once, I can hit twice
I hit the baddest chicks
Shorty don't believe me, then call me tonight
And I'll show you magic
(What? What?) Magic
 I got the magic stick (clit)



I know if I get licked once, I get licked twice
I give em' the baddest chick
Shorty you don't believe me, then call me tonight
And I'll show you magic
(What? What? Magic), uh huh uh huh
 I got the magic clit (stick)
