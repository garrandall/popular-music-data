Whoa 


Stressed out, uptight, over worked wow'd
Unleash what you got let's explore your naughty side
Follow me, where we're going we don't need no bread crumbs

Cause I got one thing on my mind, I'll be your valentine
Spread your wings and baby fly away

Love if you want to, scream if you want to
Just let me love you lay right here, girl don't be scared of me

Just let me love you lay right here, I'll be your fantasy
Give you sex therapy
