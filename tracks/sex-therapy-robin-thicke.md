Stressed out, uptight, overworked, riled up
Unleash what you got let's explore your naughty side
Follow me, where we're going, we don't need no bread crumbs
Can't you see, baby? You're the only one

You are among the few hot women
Let me be your medicine
Cause I got one thing on my mind, I'll be your valentine
Spread your wings and baby, fly away

It's your body, we can love if you want to
Loud if you want to, scream if you want to
Just let me love you, lay right here, girl, don't be scared of me
Give you sex therapy, give you sex therapy

It's your body, we'll go hard if you want to
As hard as you want to, soft as you want to
Just let me love you, lay right here, I'll be your fantasy
Give you sex therapy, give you sex therapy

Baby, that's all for you to do, let your body be
I'll lick you down, I'll make you feel like you're out of body
The doctor's here for you

Take you like Twilight, I'll bite your neck
You don't have to stay in the rain, I'll get you wet, yeah
Push you up against the wall, turn you out and turn you on
Yea, yea, whoa

It's your body, we can love if you want to
Loud if you want to, scream if you want to
Just let me love you, lay right here, girl, don't be scared of me
Give you sex therapy, give you sex therapy

It's your body, we'll go hard if you want to
As hard as you want to, soft as you want to
Just let me love you, lay right here, I'll be your fantasy
Give you sex therapy, give you sex therapy

Girl, it's your body we can do whatever you like
Girl, it's your body we can do whatever you like
It's your body we can ride and rock and roll
Ride and rock and roll
Ride and rock, oh oh oh oh

It's your body, we can love if you want to
Loud if you want to, scream if you want to
Just let me love you, lay right here, girl, don't be scared of me
Give you sex therapy, give you sex therapy

It's your body, we'll go hard if you want to
As hard as you want to, soft as you want to
Just let me love you, lay right here, I'll be your fantasy
Give you sex therapy, give you sex therapy

Shawty, shawty it's your body we can do can do can do
(Sex therapy)
Shawty, shawty it's your body we can do whatever you like
(Sex therapy)
Just let me love you, lay right here, girl, don't be scared of me
Give you sex therapy, give you sex therapy
