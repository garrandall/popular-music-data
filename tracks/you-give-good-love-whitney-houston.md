I found out what I've been missing
Always on the run
I've been looking for someone


Now you're here, like you've been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see that you give good love to me
Baby, so good
Take this heart of mine into your hands
You give good love to me
Never too much
Baby, you give good love


Never stopping
I was always searching for that perfect love
The kind that girls like me dream of


Now you're here, like you've been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see that you give good love to me
Baby, so good
Take this heart of mine into your hands
You give good love to me
Never too much
Baby, you give good love


Now I, I can't stop looking around
It's not what this love's all about
Our love is here to stay, stay


Now you're here, like you've been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see that you give good love to me
Baby, so good
Take this heart of mine into your hands
You give good love to me
Never too much
Baby, you give good love
