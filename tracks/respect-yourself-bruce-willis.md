If you disrespect everybody
That you run into
How in the world do you think
Anybody 'sposed to respect you

If you don't give a heck about
The man with a bible in his hand
Just get out the way and
Let the gentleman do his thing

You're the kind of gentleman
That wants everything their way
Take the sheet off your face, boy
It's a brand new day

Respect yourself
Respect yourself
If you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good
Ca-hoot na na na oh oh
Respect yourself

If you're walking around thinking
That the world owes you something
'Cause you're here
You're going out the world backwards
Like you did when you first came here

Keep talking about the president
Won't stop air pollution
Put your hand over your mouth
When you cough
That'll help the solution

You cuss around women folk
You don't even know their name
Then you're dumb enough to think
That it makes you a big ol' man

Respect yourself
Respect yourself
If you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good
Ca-hoot na na na oh oh
Respect yourself

Respect yourself
Respect yourself
If you dont respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good
Ca-hoot na na na oh oh
Respect yourself
