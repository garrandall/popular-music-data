I lay beside you in the warmth of the night.
I can fell you breathe, I can hear you sigh, so softly.
Tell me now baby, this feeling won't change.
That it's a lasting love, not a passing phase, darling
I need to know I can depend on you.
I need someone who's gonna see me through.


(Baby be there)
There when I need you,
Tell me you care,
Make me believe you.
Promise you will stay by my side.
Through the good times, through the bad times.
If you just swear, that you'll be there.

Bring me your kisses, for the rest of my life.
Baby feel my face, as we lie in the nights, with your love.
I'll always be, will be there for you.
So won't you tell me now,
That you'll be there too, darling.

And every morning when the sun will rise.
I wanna see love shining in your eyes.
Tell me you'll still be mine.


(Baby be there)
There when I need you,
Tell me you care,
Make me believe you.
Promise you will stay by my side.
Through the good times, through the bad times.
If you just swear, that you'll be there.

Be there, be there, of your love I can be sure of.
I have all I need baby.
As long as I have your love.
I wanna be the one you reach for each night girl.
So every night till the end of time.
Baby be there.


(Baby be there)
There when I need you,
Tell me you care,
Make me believe you.
Promise you will stay by my side.
Through the good times, through the bad times.
If you just swear, that you'll be there.

Just swear
(Baby be there)
There when I need you,
Tell me you care,
Make me believe you
