Another dream that will never come true
Just to compliment your sorrow
Another life that I've taken from you
A gift to add onto your pain and suffering

Another truth you can never believe
Has crippled you, completely
All the cries you're beginning to hear
Trapped in your mind, and the sound is deafening


Let me enlighten you
This is the way I pray


Living just isn't hard enough
Burn me alive, inside
Living my life's not hard enough
Take everything away


Another nightmare about to come true
Will manifest, tomorrow
Another love that I've taken from you
Lost in time, on the edge of suffering

Another taste of the evil I breed
Will level you, completely
Bring to life everything that you fear
Live in the dark, and the world is threatening


Let me enlighten you
This is the way I pray


Living just isn't hard enough
Burn me alive, inside
Living my life's not hard enough
Take everything away


Return to me, return to me, return to me
Turn to me, leave me no one
Turn to me, return to me, return to me
Turn to me, cast aside

Return to me, return to me, return to me
Turn to me, leave me no one
Turn to me, return to me, return to me
You've made me turn away


Living just isn't hard enough
Burn me alive, inside
Living my life's not hard enough
They take everything from you

Living just isn't hard enough
Burn me alive, inside
Living my life's not hard enough
Take everything away
