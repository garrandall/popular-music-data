Clap your hands everybody
If you got what it takes
'Cause I'm Kurtis Blow and I want you to know
That these are the breaks


Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head (ha-HA-HA-HA)
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under


Express yourself
I'm expressing with my full capabilities
And now I'm living in correctional facilities


Bass! How low can you go?
Death row, what a brother knows


I wanna rock right now
I'm Rob Bass and I came to get down
I'm not internationally known
But I'm known to rock a microphone
So let's go, go!
(Sing it Jimmy!)
It takes two to make a thing go right!
It takes two to make it out--


Yo, yo, yo baby pop baby-pop
Yeah, you come here, give me a kiss
Better make it fast or else I'm gonna get pissed
Now push it
Ah, push it
Push it good
Ah, push it
Push it real good


All right, stop


Engine, engine, number 9
On the New York transit line
If my train falls off the track
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up


Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain
Insane in the membrane
Crazy, insane, got no brain

(Break it down
Oh, put your hands up! Put your hands up!)


Let me clear my throat! Oh!
Have mercy baby! I hope you don't mind! Aha-aha


Whooo! Y'all gonna make me lose my mind up in here, up in here!
Y'all gonna make me go all out!
Up in here! Up in here! Oh!


It's getting hot in here (So hot!)
So take off all your clothes
I am getting so hot
I'm gonna take my clothes off


Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, shawty
It's your birthday
We're gonna party like it's ya birthday
We're gonna sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't really care, it's not your birthday


My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so
And this I know for sho
Hey Ya! Hey Ya!


A milli, a milli, a milli, a milli
A-a-a milli, a milli, a milli


All I do is win, win, win, no matter what
Got money on my mind I can't ever get enough
And every time I step up in the building everybody's hands go up


Teach me how to dougie
Teach me, teach me how to dougie
All the girls love me
All the, all the the girls love me
All the girls love me
You ain't messing with my dougie


(Oh! Here's a hip hop tune you know)
I think I'm Big Meech, Larry Hoover
Whipping work, hallelujah
(Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, stop!
Why do you always do that?)


Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait?
Let me tell you a story about my situation
I was talking to this girl from the U.S. Nation
You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend
Oh baby, you, you got what I need (Everybody!)
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend
You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend
Oh baby, you, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend


Clap your hands everybody if you got what it takes
( Cause I'm Justin
 I'm Jimmy!
And we want you to know)
That these are the breaks
