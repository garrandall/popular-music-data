Hello, hello
I like your smile
Hello, hello
Shall we talk awhile
Would you like some of my tangerine
I know I'd never treat you mean
Never knew how I'd meet you
Didn't know how to greet you
When I saw you look that way
I knew I had to say hello, hello
Always longed to say I love you
Always been too high above you
Now you're not so far away
Now at last I can say
Hello, hello
You got pretty hair
Hello, hello
Can't you tell I care
Would you like some of my tangerine
You know I'd never treat you mean, oh, no
You know I'd never treat you mean
