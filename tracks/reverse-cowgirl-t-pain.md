Welcome to my rodeo
Hold on to me
Baby Imma take it slow
How you ride is the key

We gonna go left, right, front, back
That just ain't enough
I can take you everywhere
All around the world
I like how you do it
Just put it in reverse cowgirl
Get it up get it up
Pump it up girl
Set it up set it up
I like how you do it
Just put it in reverse cowgirl
Get it up get it up
Pump it up girl
Set it up set it up
I like how you do it do it do it

Just put your hands in the air
Wave em round and go
Ewwww...Haaa Eee...ahhh
Put your hands in the air
Wave em round and go
Ewwww...Haaa Eee...ahhh
Girl

Baby let me rope you up
Tie you down
Do it right
No matter how hard you buck
Gonna get wild all night

We gonna go left, right, front, back
That just ain't enough
I can take you everywhere
All around the world
I like how you do it
Just put it in reverse cowgirl
Get it up get it up
Pump it up girl
Set it up set it up
I like how you do it
Just put it in reverse cowgirl
Get it up get it up
Pump it up girl
Set it up set it up
I like how you do it do it do it

Just put your hands in the air
Wave em round and go
Ewwww...Haaa Eee...ahhh
Put your hands in the air
Wave em round and go
Ewwww...Haaa Eee...ahhh


Girl you lookin like a nine
Where I'm from that's a neener
If she got that trunk space
Remind me of my Beemer
Yeah right, that 760 that not that 745
Like the way you back it up
Even might to let ya try
Get jail no bail
Worried because I'm high risk
I'm the type to ride and listen to his own shit
Like the way I write the track
I'm tryin to pull the tracks out
I'm gonna be a chiropractor
I'm bout to check her back out
Told em like the Feds
Take a picture I don't give a fuck nah
We can do it anywhere
Even in my Caddy truck
Yeah you know she thoroughbred
Me I gets that thoroughbred
Girls just say shes so smart
That's why I call her thorough head

Just put it in reverse cowgirl
Get it up get it up
Pump it up girl
Set it up set it up
I like how you do it
Just put it in reverse cowgirl
Get it up get it up
Pump it up girl
Set it up set it up
I like how you do it do it do it

Just put your hands in the air
Wave em round and go
Ewwww...Haaa Eee...ahhh
Put your hands in the air
Wave em round and go
Ewwww...Haaa Eee...ahhh
Girl

Get it up get it up
Set it up set it up
Get it up get it up
Set it up set it up
