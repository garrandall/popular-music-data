Ok, so your heart is broken 
You're sitting around mopin', cryin', cryin' 
You say you even think about dying 
Well, before you do anything rash, baby, dig this 

Everybody plays the fool, sometime 
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby 
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I ain't lying 
Everybody plays the fool 

Fallin' in love is such an easy thing to do 
But there's no guarantee that the one you love, is gonna love you 
Oh, loving eyes they cannot see a certain person could never be 
Love runs deeper than any ocean, it clouds your mind with emotion 

Everybody plays the fool, sometime 
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby 
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I ain't lying 
Everybody plays the fool 

How can you help it, when the music starts to play 
And your ability to reason, is swept away 
Oh, heaven on earth is all you see, you're out of touch with reality 
And now you cry, but when you do, next time around someone cries for you 

Hey, everybody plays the fool, sometime 
Use your heart just like a tool, listen baby 
They never tell you so in school, I wanna say it again, 
Everybody plays the fool 

Everybody plays the fool, sometime 
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby 
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I ain't lying 
Everybody plays the fool 

Every plays the fool, sometime 
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby 
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I wanna say it again 
Everybody plays the fool
