Okay, so you're heartbroken
You sit around mopin'
Crying, crying
You say you're even thinking about dying?
Well, before you do anything rash
Dig this


Everybody plays the fool sometime
There's no exception to the rule
Listen, baby
It may be factual, may be cruel
I ain't lying
Everybody plays the fool


Falling in love is such an easy thing to do
And there's no guarantee that the one you love
Is gonna love you

Oh, loving eyes, they cannot see
A certain person could never be
Love runs deeper than any ocean
It clouds your mind with emotion


Everybody plays the fool sometime
There's no exception to the rule
Listen, baby
It may be factual, may be cruel
I wanna tell you that
Everybody plays the fool


How can you help it when the music starts to play
And your ability to reason is swept away

Oh, heaven on earth is all you see
You're out of touch with reality
And now you cry, but when you do
Next time around someone cries for you


Everybody plays the fool sometime
They use your heart just like a tool
Listen baby
They never tell you so in school
I wanna say it again
Everybody plays the fool

Listen to me, baby
Everybody plays the fool sometime
(There's no exception to the rule)
No exception to the rule
It may be factual, may be cruel sometimes
Everybody plays the fool


Listen, listen, baby
Everybody plays the fool
