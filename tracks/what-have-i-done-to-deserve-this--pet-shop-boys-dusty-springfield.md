You always wanted a lover
I only wanted a job
I've always worked for my living
How am I gonna get through?
How am I gonna get through?


I come here looking for money
Got to have it
And end up living with love, oh, oh
Now you left me with nothing
Can't take it
How am I gonna get through?
How am I gonna get through?


I bought you drinks, I brought you flowers
I read your books and talked for hours
Every day, so many drinks
Such pretty flowers, so tell me
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I


Since you went away I've been hanging around
I've been wondering why I'm feeling down
You went away, it should make me feel better
But I don't know, oh
How I'm gonna get through
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
How I'm gonna get through
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?


You always wanted me to be something I wasn't
You always wanted too much, oh, oh
Now I can do what I want to, forever
How am I gonna get through?
How am I gonna get through?


At night, the people come and go
They talk too fast and walk too slow
Chasing time from hour to hour
I pour the drinks and crush the flowers
What have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I


Since you went away I've been hanging around
I've been wondering why I'm feeling down
You went away, it should make me feel better
But I don't know, oh
How I'm gonna get through
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
Baby
How I'm gonna get through
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
Baby
How I'm gonna get through
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
Baby
How I'm gonna get through
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
Tell me
How I'm gonna get through
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
Baby
How I'm gonna get through
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
Yeah


I'm gonna get through
I'm gonna get through
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
I'm gonna get through, right?
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
We don't have to fall apart, we don't have to fight
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
We don't need to go to hell and back every night
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
We can make a deal
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
We don't have to fall apart, we don't have to fight
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
We don't need to go to hell and back every night
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
