I warned you baby from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen
Now pay me no mind

So I'm movin' on, I'm rollin' on
You've broken your vow and it's all over now
So I'm movin' on

That big eight-wheeler rollin' down the track
Means your true lovin' daddy ain't comin' back
'Cause I'm movin' on, I'm rollin' on
You were flyin' too high for my little sky
So I'm movin' on

Someday baby when you had you play
Your gonna want your daddy but your daddy will say
Keep on movin', keep rollin' on
I'm through with you, too bad you're blue
'Cause I'm movin' on

Mister Engineer take the throttle in hand
And take me down to that southern land
Keep movin' on, keep rollin' on
You can ease my mind if you get me there on time
Move on

Mister Fireman, won't you please listen to me?
'Cause I got a pretty woman in Tennessee
Keep movin' on, keep rollin' on
She's fine as can be and she's waitin' on me
Keep movin' on

I'm gonna move, I'm gonna move
I'm gonna move, I'm gonna move
Whoa move, whoa move
Whoa move, whoa move on
Keep on movin', every day, every night
And all the time baby

I'm gonna move on, I'm gonna move on
Yeah, gonna move, I'm gonna move on now
I'm gonna move on, I'm gonna move
