This is the story about a dog
A female dog

Froggy, froggy style

I know you want a little froggy style
Come with me and we can get buckwild
I know you want a little
Froggy style

I know you want a little froggy style
Come with me and we can get buckwild
I know you want a little
Froggy style

I'm in my room
Thinking about you
Sneaking from behind
Ready for the 1, 2
Feeling kinda freaky
Damn near tweaking
I wanna give it to you
You got me feenin'

I just wanna rock you
All night long
Oh oh oh oh
I just wanna rock you
All night long
All night, all night

I know you want a little froggy style
Come with me and we can get buckwild
I know you want a little
Froggy style

I know you want a little froggy style
Come with me and we can get buckwild
I know you want a little
Froggy style

Don't get me wrong 'cause I'm not afraid
But making love to you brings out the player in me
Mm, the way you climb on top
Froggy on you
I like the way you work it, baby
So keep on doing what you do


I just wanna rock you
All night long
Oh oh oh oh oh
I just wanna rock you
All night long
All night, all night

I know you want a little froggy style
Come with me and we can get buckwild
I know you want a little
Froggy style

I know you want a little froggy style
Come with me and we can get buckwild
I know you want a little
Froggy style

(Laughs) Ah yeah
Now that's what I like
Really tho'
Do it baby
Uh, uh
Freak me
Ah yeah, Froggy style
Froggy style
Uh huh
In the meanwhile
But in the meanwhile

I just wanna rock you
All night long
Oh oh oh oh oh
I just wanna rock you
All night long
All night long, night long, oh

I know you want a little froggy style
Come with me and we can get buckwild
I know you want a little
Froggy style

I know you want a little froggy style
Come with me and we can get buckwild
I know you want a little
Froggy style

I know you want a little froggy style
Come with me and we can get buckwild
Woof!
Buckwildin', buckwildin', buckwildin'

I know you want a little froggy style
Come with me and we can get buckwild
Woof!
Buckwildin', buckwildin', buckwildin'

I know you want a little froggy style (I just wanna rock you)
Come with me and we can get buckwild
(All night long) I know you want a little
Froggy style
I know you want a little froggy style
(I just wanna rock you)
Come with me and we can get buckwild
(All night long) I know you want a little
(All night long, night long, oh) Froggy style
