Used to play the Casanova
Smoother than the Bossa Nova
Love to play the Romeo
But I never need a home to go to
I'm so greasy, I'm so slick.
I leave no traces
I just get out quick
I use cheap champagne
Brief affairs and backstage love

But a love like this
Is much too good
To ever throwaway

I've played the fool
I've played the clown
I'm an easy lover
When I come to town
It's a fashion
It's a buyers market
It's a buyer's market
To bust it up
Before it's really started
I'm incurably romantic
If you leave me I'll go frantic
With cheap champagne
Brief affairs and backstage love

But a love like this
Is much too good
To ever throwaway
Yes a love like this
Is much too good
To ever throwaway
If the glove still fits
Don't call it quits
Don't throw your life away
Cause a love like this
Is much too good
To ever throwaway

Used to play the Casanova
Faster than a roller coaster
I gave you the best years of my life
Don't you kick me in the gutter

Cause a love like this
Is much too good
To ever throwaway
Yes a love like this
Is much too good
To ever throwaway
Yes there's many a slip
Between a cup and lip
Don't let it slide away
Cause a love like this
Is much too good
To ever throwaway
