Strange

Ow
Fine lady
Ow

I like the way she walks, I like the way she talks
As she turns me on with a special concern
Now, I'm a different guy, and I don't compare to many
But next to her I'm plain ordinary
Not many can see the light blue aura
That surrounds the girl wherever in the world
She's a nine, a ten, a twenty-fifth
She's bittersweet and a taco treat

(She's strange) And I like it
(She's strange) Just the way she is
(Strange) Walking down the avenue
(She's strange) Always doing something new

She's the kind of person everybody knows
She reeks distinction from head to toe
She's my Twilight Zone, my Al Capone
She's my Rolling Stones and my Eva Per√≥n

(And I like it) Yes, I like it
(I like it) The way she wears her hair
(And I like it) Mmm, mmm
(I like it)

In room 123, she's elusive, you see
Like the invisible man in drag
And when you come to meet her, you'll never greet her
She'll be waving her skirt as a flag
Like the cold in October, she'll take you right over
It's not mean to be facetious
And that look in her eye says you're the guy
She plans to spend this evening with

(She's strange) And I like it (And I like it)
(She's strange) Just the way she is (Just the way she is)
(Strange) Walking down the avenue (I like the way she does everything she do)
(She's strange) Always doing something new

No, no-no, no-no
Knock me off my feet
Strange
