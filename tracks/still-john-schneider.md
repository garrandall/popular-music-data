Every step is the same 
Whether in the sunshine or in the rain 
If you can hold on even through the pain 
Show up tomorrow - do it all again 
Show up tomorrow - do it all again 

You'll have better love, better love 
You are - you are courageous walk on, walk on 
These are the times that can make us 
Courageous and strong 

There's a bigger plan that's what they say 
But you still gotta make it through today 
You may be feeling scared you want to run away 
But if you choose to look fear in the face 
You'll have better love, better love 

You are courageous, walk on - walk on 
These are the times that can make us 
Courageous and strong 

Life is hard that's how it goes 
You've come this far - you gotta know that you are 
You are courageous, walk on walk on 

These are the times that can make us 
Courageous and strong 

You are - you are courageous 
Courageous and strong
