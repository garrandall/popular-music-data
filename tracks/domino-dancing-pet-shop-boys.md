The man who's escorting Don Juan to his bride
Knows he is courting an impudent pride
Think of his jealousy, oh where will he hide?
The man who's escorting Don Juan to his bride

The man who will cover for Don Juan's old soothsayer
Films for a Warner brother or Mister Goldwyn-Mayer
Think of his starlet, how much will he pay her?
The man who will cover for Don Juan's old soothsayer

An impasse has been reached
With the teacher of the rich
To quit would be discreet if swift
But you know that I can't do that

It would be a disaster
It would be a disaster
I've got this sinking feeling
I'm not dreaming
We'll be sorry soon

At the end of the day when everyone's resigned
To the heart of the matter and the measures in mind
King Zog's back from holiday, Marie Lupescu's grey
And King Alexander is dead in Marseilles

An impasse has been reached
With the teacher of the rich
To quit would be discreet if swift
But you know that I can't do that

It would be a disaster
It would be a disaster
I've got this sinking feeling
I'm not dreaming
We'll be sorry soon
