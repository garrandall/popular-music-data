Time it took us
To where the water was
Thatâs what the water gave me
And time goes quicker
Between the two of us
Oh, my love, donât forsake me
Take what the water gave me

Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
Pockets full of stones

Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow

And oh, poor Atlas
The worldâs a beast of a burden
Youâve been holding up a long time
And all this longing
And the ships are left to rust
Thatâs what the water gave us

So lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
Pockets full of stones
Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow

âCause they took your loved ones
But returned them in exchange for you
But would you have it any other way?
Would you have it any other way?
You couldn't have it any other way

âCause sheâs a cruel mistress
And a bargain must be made
But oh, my love, donât forget me
When I let the water take me

So lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the over flow
Pockets full of stones

Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow

So lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
Pockets full of stones

Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
