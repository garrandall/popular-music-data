Jesus is a soul man,
Jesus is a soul man,
Jesus is a soul man,
And I'm sure sold on Him.

Oh they say that he's a square,
That Jesus, He aint nowhere.
I know better, He lives in my heart.
Jesus is a soul man.

You can find Him in the Bible pages.
Jesus - he's the rock of ages.
Hides me in the cleft of the rock.
Jesus is a soul man.

He calms the waves when the storm is ragin.
Keeps me safe when the devils ravin.
He's my staff, he's my sword and my shield.
Jesus is a soul man.

Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
The king, he said, In the fire you must go.
He found out that the fire wouldn't burn em.
They were saved by the soul man.
