It's Electric!

You can't see it

You gotta feel it

Oh, it's shakin'

[Jiggle-a-mesa-cara
She's a pumpin' like a matic
She's a movin' like electric
She sure got the boogie]

You gotta know it
[It's electric
Boogie woogie, woogie!]
Now you can't hold it
[It's electric
Boogie woogie, woogie!]
But you know it there
Yeah here there everywhere

I've got to move
I'm going on a party ride
I've got to groove, groove, groove
And from this music
I just can't hide

Are you comin' with me?
Come let me take you on a party ride
And I'll teach you, teach you, teach you
I'll teach you the electric slide

Some say it's mystic
[It's electric
Boogie woogie, woogie]
You can't resist it
[It's electric
Boogie woogie, woogie]
You can'y do without it
[It's electric
Boogie woogie, woogie]
Jiggle-a-mesa-cara she's a pumpin' like a matic
She's movin' like electric
She sure got the boogie

Don't wanna lose it
[It's electric
Boogie woogie, woogie]
But you can't choose it
[It's electric
Boogie woogie, woogie]
But you know it's there
Yeah here there everywhere

I've got to move
Come let me take you on a party ride
And I'll teach you, teach you, teach you
I'll teach you the electric slide

Some say it's mystic
[It's electric
Boogie woogie, woogie]
You can't resist it
[It's electric
Boogie woogie, woogie]
You can'y do without it
[It's electric
Boogie woogie, woogie]
Jiggle-a-mesa-cara she's a pumpin' like a matic
She's movin' like electric
She sure got the boogie

Don't wanna lose it
[It's electric
Boogie woogie, woogie]
But you can't choose it
[It's electric
Boogie woogie, woogie]
But you know it's there
Yeah here there everywhere
