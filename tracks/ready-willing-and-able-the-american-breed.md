Right now, you're hung up on someone
Who really don't need you
How long are you gonna fall for
The lines that he feeds you

Now you're wasting precious time
You wait for him when you know that

I'm ready, willing, and able
To give you all the love you need
I'm ready, willing, and able
I'm qualified to satisfy you

If he really, really loves you
You wouldn't be so lonesome
Sweet love shouldn't be wasted
When you know I want some

Now you need someone to care
Say the word and I'll be there

I've got a whole lotta loving
That I wanna give you
Come on, get yourself together
And let me stay with you

Girl, it's gonna be a groove
The time is right, make your move
