Pain, flows like a river, just keeps on livin'
with all them memories
Shame, you're so heartbroken
now you're scared to open and give your love again
And now anticipation waits for love
Will it be everything you dreamed this time around
I know you have your doubts
but I won't let you down

Darlin' if, if we fall in love tonight
you're gonna be alright
your heart is in good hands
Darlin' if, if we fall in love again
on me you can depend, if you could take a chance
Open your heart and let love, love again

Blame, who's fault is it this time
I can see it in your eyes, I know you're wonderin'
Things can change, say you'll be all mine
I'm gonna love you all the time
Don't let it slip away
And now anticipation waits for love
Will it be everything you dreamed this time around
I know you've got your doubts
but honey I won't let you down

Darlin' if, if we fall in love tonight
you're gonna be alright
your heart is in good hands
Darlin' if, if we fell in love again
on me you can depend, if you can take a chance
and open your heart and let love, love again

Honey I don't, I don't want you to have any doubts about me
Whatever makes you happy, I'm gonna do
Baby I'm so ready to love you down
I can't wait another moment I need you right now

Darlin' if, if we fall in love tonight
you're gonna be alright
your heart is in good hands
Darlin' if, if we fall in love again
on me you can depend, if you can take a chance

Open your heart and let love, love again
