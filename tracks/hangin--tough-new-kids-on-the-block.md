You can hear them going crazy
In stadiums in every nation
A never-ending celebration baby
That's how we show our dedication
The boys in the band
The boys in the band
We do it for the fans
The boys in the band

Where the ladies, let the crowd in
'Cause it's about to get loud in here
And we're only getting started baby
Everybody wanna party
With the boys in the band
The boys in the band
We do it for the fans
The boys in the band

And if it isn't love
Then why these new editions keep on showin' up
And why do boys from Boston keep on hangin' tough
Went from boys to men but we ain't ever growin' up
Can't get enough

You can hear them going crazy
In stadiums in every nation
A never-ending celebration baby
That's how we show our dedication
The boys in the band
The boys in the band
We do it for the fans
The boys in the band

We like the boys
The boys in the band
The boys in the band
The boys in the band
We like the boys
The boys in the band
The boys in the band
The boys in the band

Before we go Boyz II Men to the end of (the road)
Let's go back to the beginnin', pay respect, New Edition
Then came BBD, BSB, B2K, 1D
98 Degrees, "Come and Talk to Me", Jodeci
From B-Brown to Beantown to H-Town to O-Town
Came the sound Berry Gordy found all the way back in Motown
Ah, had to catch my breath
Peace, LFO, Menudo, JLS, BTS
Westlife, Jackson 5, NSYNC, Take That
I want you

And if it is enough
Then why does every generation have another one
And why do all directions only lead to one
Before you know there'll be even more to come
You can't get enough, whoa

You can hear them going crazy
In stadiums in every nation
A never-ending celebration baby
That's how we show our dedication
The boys in the band
All around the world
The boys in the band
All across the land
Let me hear you say
The boys in the band
We wanna be with the boys in the band

We like the boys
The boys in the band
The boys in the band
The boys in the band
We like the boys
The boys in the band
The boys in the band
The boys in the band
