You had to be the one to say it
You couldn't keep it our secret, oh, no
All over town, everybody's talking
It ain't no secret anymore
You are the one they're saying
That has phony information
My confidence you've been betraying
I don't know what (I don't know what) To do
'Cause the word is out

That you and I are lovers (Oh, yeah)
That you and I are lovers
That you and I've been getting it on
The word is out
That you and I are lovers (Oh, yeah)
That you and I are lovers
That you and I've been getting it on
It on, it on, it on, it on

There's nothing left to do but stop it
I won't repeat it, oh no, I won't
I can't stand the gossip out on the streets now
How could they see us behind closed doors?
Why did you have to tell them?
I told you not to say a word
Why did you have to say it
We were never seen (Never seen)
Now I can't believe the word is out

That you and I are lovers
That you and I are lovers (Oh yeah)
That you and I've been getting it on
The word, the word, the word is out
That you and I are lovers
That you and I are lovers
That you and I've been getting it on
The word is out

That you and I are lovers (Oh, yeah)
That you and I are lovers
That you and I've been getting it on
The word, the word, the word is out
That you and I are lovers (Oh, yeah)
That you and I are lovers
That you and I've been getting it on
It on, it on, it on, it on

You are the one they're saying
That has phony information
My confidence you've been betraying
I don't know what (Don't know what) To do
'Cause the word is out

That you and I are lovers
That you and I are lovers
That you and I've been getting it on
The word, the word, the word is out
That you and I are lovers (Don't you know?)
That you and I are lovers (Oh yeah)
That you and I've been getting it on
The word is out

That you and I are lovers (I told you so)
That you and I are lovers (Oh yeah)
That you and I've been getting it on
I told you not to tell your friends, oh, yeah
That you and I are lovers
That you and I are lovers
That you and I've been getting it on
The word is out

That you and I are lovers
That you and I are lovers
That you and I've been getting it on
