Twist, twist, Senora
Hey now, hey now
Twist all around
What you say, now
Twist, twist, Senora
Come on, come on
Shake it up and down
One more time, now
Jump, jump, Senora
Let me hear you, now
Jump all around
Come on, come on
Twist, twist, Senora
Well, all right
Twist it all around

Well, there's a real swinging
Dance called the twist, now
Come on and get with it
Young and old dance together
Come on and dance
Bring your partner

Twist, twist, Senora
Come on, come on
Twist all around
Well, well, alright
Twist, twist, Senora
Yeah, oh, yeah
Shake it up and down
Let me hear you, now
Jump, jump, Senora
Jump up in the air now
Jump through the night
Let me hear you now
Twist, twist Senora
Come on, come on
Twist it all around, well

When I say stick your
Shoulders, I mean so
Left or right to the temple
And in case you get a notion
Jump in the air
Come down In slow motion

Twist, twist, Senora
Come on, come on
Twist all around
Twist with me, now
Twist, twist, senora
Come on, come on
Shake it up and down
Come on, baby
Jump, jump Senora
Let me hear you now
Jump through the night
What you say, now
Twist, twist, Senora
Alright, well, alright
Twist it all around

Blow, blow, daddy

Jump, jump, Senora
Jump through the night
Twist, twist, Senora
Twist it all around
Twist, twist, Senora
Twist it all around
Twist, twist, Senora
Shake it up and down

I want a pretty girl to assist me
Go with me on up 5th street
And in case she gets a notion
I want her to jump in the air
Come down in slow motion

Twist, twist, Senora
Come on, come on
Twist all around
And jump up, jump up
Twist, twist, Senora
Yeah, well, alright
Twist it up and down
Shake, baby, now
Jump, jump, Senora
Yeah, oh, yeah
Jump up and down
