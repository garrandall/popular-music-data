(You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love)

Here's how it goes, you and me, up and down
But maybe this time we'll get it right, worth the fight
'Cause love is something you can't shake
When it breaks
All it takes is some trying

If you feel like leaving
I'm not gonna beg you to stay
But soon you'll be finding
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love

So if you go
You should know
It's hard to just forget the past so fast
It was good, it was bad but it was real
And that's all you have in the end, our love mattered

If you feel like leaving
I'm not gonna beg you to stay (I'm not gonna beg you to stay)
But soon you'll be finding
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love

You can run (you can run)
You can hide (you can hide)
But you can't escape my love (my love)
You can run (you can run)
You can hide (you can hide)
But you can't escape my love

Here's how it goes
All it takes is some trying
You can run...

If you feel like leaving
I'm not gonna beg you to stay (I'm not gonna beg you to stay)
Soon you'll be finding (you'll be finding)
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love (escape my love)

If you feel like leaving
I'm not gonna beg you to stay (you can't escape my love)
Soon you'll be finding
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love

You can run 

Baby, you can run, baby, you can hide
But you can't escape my love
Baby, you can run, baby, you can hide
But you can't escape my love

But you can't escape my love
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love
