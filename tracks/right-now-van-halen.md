Don't wanna wait til tomorrow
Why put it off another day?
One more walk through problems
Built up, and stand in our way ,ah
One step ahead, one step behind me
Now you gotta run to get even
Make future plans, don't dream about yesterday, hey
C'mon turn, turn this thing around


Right now, hey
It's your tomorrow
Right now
C'mon,it's everything
Right now
Catch a magic moment, do it
Right here and now
It means everything

Miss the beat, you lose the rhythm
And nothing falls into place, no
Only missed by a fraction
Slipped a little off your pace, oh
The more things you get, the more you want
Just trade in one for the other
Workin so hard, to make it easier, whoa
Got to turn, c'mon turn this thing around



It's enlightened me, right now
What are you waitin for
Oh, yeah, right now





Right now, oh, Right now
It's what's happening?
Right here and now
Right now
It's right now
Oh
Tell me, what are you waiting for
Turn this thing around
