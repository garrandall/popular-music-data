Two fingers in the air cause I'm too gone
Tell them hating ass niggas don't lose hope
And tell the waitress bring a few more
We in this bitch like before you get 2-O
She with a friend, hope I did them both
And when you fuck boys, guy I hope you be broke
I like my girls small waist big culo
Pussy bubble gum pink like Nuvo
Flow tight like precious in the tudo
Oh you're finally getting money nigga Kudos!
I've been about mine since the playground
Since another bad creation made the playground
Cut the molly,
Beat that pussy up, then I tear it down
And a hardcore freak is how I like her note
That love but a Rowdy paper

Rowdy, Rowdy, I'm a young almost bought it
100 K that's stuntin
You see me that's money
Rowdy, Rowdy I'm a young almost bought it
You see me that's money
100 K that's stuntin

Had a centerfold before I put my foot on the street back
Gas like the freeway when they put on a beat
Heartbreakers in the stand like desert
They fall us in the stray like the ass curve
Rotty, rotty paper like the gas alert
And I ain't playing with yo kids no more less turn
I'd be smoking papers with the tellers
When put a killer out of state
12-13 filling cup of B12
They hear me they hear the wave like sea shell
Sit, vomit, people hatin on me
But they don't know I get paid off every comment,
Commas, that's commas
Young Suzy go crazy on mamas
Putting on the city everyday, YM this bitch

Rowdy, Rowdy, I'm a young almost bought it
100 K that's stuntin
You see me that's money
Rowdy, Rowdy I'm a young almost bought it
You see me that's money
100 K that's stuntin

Four fingers in the air cause it's for life
At the comic girl go the whole night
Chanel booth sync yeah them hoes like
Got a chick in the basement
Man I love to sleep behind her
I'll be rapping for my jets and she for real about my ninest
Get money grind hard and for the finest
Fuck turnt up take the party to the diner
Smoking east bay fuck in the A like JR writer
Niggas rap same shit I kill them all with one
Like what, shout out to the homey problem
What it is?
They gonna pint at me cause we is all them
Swerving through he hood with my jewels
Just me and my respect
Ain't even got my tune on
Shout out to them rappers hating cause they look on
Shout out to poking department shout out to Sue

Rowdy, Rowdy, I'm a young almost bought it
100 K that's stuntin
You see me that's money
Rowdy, Rowdy I'm a young almost bought it
You see me that's money
100 K that's stuntin
