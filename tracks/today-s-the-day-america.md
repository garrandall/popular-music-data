Hold me close
You turn nighttime into day
And you're the most
Brightest star that lights my way

So come home to me now
'Cause it won't matter anyhow
I've got this feeling that today's the day
I've got this feeling today's the day

Turn me out
Turn me out on this fine day
'Cause all about
All the people like to play

So come home to me now
'Cause it won't matter anyhow
I've got this feeling that today's the day
I've got this feeling today's the day
I've got this feeling that today's the day
I've got this feeling today's the day

Oo, oo ...

Hold me close
You turn nighttime into day
And you're the most
Brightest star that lights my way

So come home to me now
'Cause it won't matter anyhow
I've got this feeling that today's the day
I've got this feeling today's the day
I've got this feeling that today's the day
I've got this feeling today's the day
I've got this feeling today's the day
I've got this feeling today's the day ...
