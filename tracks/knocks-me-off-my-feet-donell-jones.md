I see us in the park strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head
And words from my heart told only to the wind
Felt even without being said


I don't wanna bore you with my troubles (yeah)
But there's something 'bout your love
That makes me weak and knocks me off my feet
There's something 'bout your love
That makes me weak and knocks me off my feet
Knocks me off my feet


I don't wanna bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't wanna bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you

More and more


We lay beneath the stars under a lover's tree
That seems through the eyes of my mind
I reach out for the part of me that lives in you
That only our two hearts can find
