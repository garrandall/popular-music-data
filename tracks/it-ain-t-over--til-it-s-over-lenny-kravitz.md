Here we are still together
We are one
So much time wasted
Playing games with love


So many tears I've cried
So much pain inside
But baby It ain't over until it's over
So many years we've tried
To keep our love alive
But baby it ain't over until it's over


How many times
Did we give up
But we always worked things out
And all my doubts and fears
Kept me wondering, yeah
If I'd always, always be in love


So many tears I've cried
So much pain inside
But baby It ain't over until it's over
So many years we've tried
And kept our love alive
But baby it ain't over until it's over


So many tears I've cried
So much pain inside
But baby It ain't over until it's over
So many years we've tried
And kept our love alive
But baby it ain't over until it's over
So many tears I've cried
So much pain inside
But baby It ain't over until it's over
So many years we've tried
To keep our love alive
Cause baby it ain't over until it's over
So many tears we've cried
So much pain inside
But baby It ain't over until it's over
So many years we've tried
To keep our love alive
Cause baby it ain't over until it's over


So many tears we've cried
So much pain inside
Baby It ain't over until it's over
Over
