She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her mama and her daddy
With the baby in the backseat
50 miles to go and she was running low
On faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going away too fast
And before she knew
She was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both her lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even had time to crash
She was so scared she threw her hands up in the air
Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
So Jesus take the wheel
It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from know on tonight
Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
So Jesus take the wheel
Ooooh Jesus take the wheel
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Just save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
So Jesus take the wheel
Ohhh take it
