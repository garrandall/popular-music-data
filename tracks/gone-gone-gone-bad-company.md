Well, I been havin a little trouble lord
But I'm keepin it together yeah
My baby just walked out the doors
She said this time forever

It ain't the first time baby
Baby it won't be the last
I'd better get the boys round
And do some drinkin fast

Cause she's gone, gone, gone
I don't know if I'm happy
I don't know if I'm sad
She's gone gone gone
I don't know if I'll cry
I don't know if I'll die laughin'

Well I'm gonna miss your lovin
And your perfume and your smile
I'm gonna miss your stealin all my booze
And talkin all the while
I'm gonna miss you cleanin' round the home
And helpin' with my blues
You know I think I'll get myself a maid
And take her on a cruise

It ain't the first time baby
Baby it won't be the last
I'd better get the boys round
And do some drinkin fast

Cause she's gone gone gone
AI don't know if I'm happy
I don't know if I'm sad
She's gone gone gone
I don't know if I'll cry
I don't know if I'll die laughin'

It ain't the first time baby
Baby it won't be the last
I'd better get the boys round
And do some drinkin fast
Cause she's gone gone gone
I don't know if I'm happy
I don't know if I'm sad
She's gone gone gone
I don't know if I'll cry
I don't know if I'll die laughin'
