Mary Hill used to hang out in Cherry Hill Park
The game she played lasted all day to way after dark
Now all the girls they criticized her
But all the guys just idolized her
'cause Mary Hill was such a thrill after dark
In Cherry Hill Park

Mary Hill loved to ride on the merry-go-round
All the guys got eager eyes watchin' Mary go 'round
Now in the daytime Mary Hill was a teaser
Come the night she was such a pleaser
Mary Hill was such a thrill after dark
In Cherry Hill Park

Oh, Mary Hill sure was fun down at Cherry Hill Park
Playin' games with everyone 'till way after dark
In Cherry Hill Park, in Cherry Hill Park

And then one day, Mary Hill, she married away
A man with money said "Come on honey" and she said "Ok"
She went away to play a one man game
And since that day it ain't been the same
'cause Mary Hill was such a thrill after dark
In Cherry Hill Park

Oh, Mary Hill sure was fun down at Cherry Hill Park
Playin' games with everyone 'till way after dark
In Cherry Hill Park, in Cherry Hill Park
In Cherry Hill Park, in Cherry Hill Park
In Cherry Hill Park, in Cherry Hill Park
