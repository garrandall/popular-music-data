If I had a hammer
I'd hammer in the morning
I'd hammer in the evening
All over this land

And I'd hammer out danger
I'd hammer out a warning
I'd hammer out love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land

If I had a bell
I'd ring it in the morning
I'd ring it in the evening
All over this land

I'd ring out danger
I'd ring out a warning
I'd ring out love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land, ooh

If I had a song
I'd sing it in the morning
I'd sing it in the evening
All over this land

I'd sing out danger
I'd sing out a warning
I'd sing out love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land, ooh

Well I got a hammer
And I got a bell
And I got a song to sing
All over this land

It's the hammer of Justice
It's the bell of Freedom
It's the song about Love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land

It's the hammer of Justice
It's the bell of Freedom
It's the song about Love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land
