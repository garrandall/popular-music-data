Yeah
Yo son we gotta take it and go get the Clarks man
Yo, check it out, yo
Yo, I got a new, wooooo!!!  Niggaz don't even know son
Yo check the joint
Boom, yo I got a crazy idea how to do Clarks now
Check it out, boom, this how you freak em, boom
You go get you go get the cream joints right?  Boom
Now now, all you all you dye, is this shit right here
Boom, and this, yaknowhatI'msayin?  Any color you want
But it'd be like, blue and cream, yaknowhatI'msayin?
Shit like that, niggaz don't even know this stuff
Word is bond I'ma rock niggaz this summer, on the real
KnowhatI'msayin?  Yo son, I had crazy visions
Check it out check it out check it out, boom
Just imagine if you buy, ooooh!!  Check it out
Just imagine you bought navy blue, right
A navy blue, a navy blue pair right, boom
Of this, of this shit, knowhatI'msayin?
But dye gold top and got cream on top
Then you can have any color like
But you gotta drip it like it's marble cake...



KnowhatI'msayin?  Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Check it, yo, yo, yo, yo



Stand on the block Reebok gun cocked
Avalance rock get paid off mass murderous services
Chef break em, watch the alley cats bake em
watch the alley cats bake em
Four-nine made em, Jah create em take em
quick fast we reflect like the sky be blue true
Wu-Tang saga continue
Grab Myer Lansky crashin fantasy
get high fellas, stand by, 'here's the plan, see?'
sit back collectin' Tecs N checks and
blowin slow in a Montaro flexin
Beats break heavily word to INS bless me
Blow me like three bags of cess
For real from the Killa Hill locked and caged in
We're swarm representatives, reactin like paid men
Strive for why's, nine lives in lies
Max sell and enjoy the highs -- what



 The treasure is the glaciers of ice
 Orginal man
 Posess the power to hold G's guns and grams
 Caker baker 
 Pull off a keystone caper
Point out the baddest bitch in the crowd
 And i'm a scrape her



Proceed with caution as you enter the symphony
Degrees of pulse will increase intensely
Syndrome was caused by the deadly drums
But the battle was won by swords being swung
Slicing with a vocal
From the international vocalist
Ya style is too local
To fuck with this
All fits of antagonists
No assistance movin motionless
Mysterious swiftness
Thoughts roll down the shaft of the brain
Mental gives the signal to the physical
Whirlwind kicks and hits from every angle
Violent temperments
Uncountenance dented
Poison vintage wine rhymes I invented
Chumped by the drunken punches that punches the heart
Vital sparks from the arteries start



The treasure is the glaciers of ice original man
Posess the power of hold G's guns and grams
Straight up and down it's all good
Peace to them check castin chain snatchin gun flashin
Niggaz in the hood bubblin good
Analyze stocks, we'll be buyin lion heads and cloths
To all my house bitches, Starks will be home soon
I'm on tour chill, catch you Ninety-Six in June
But until then my ten-man team be safe
Chill on the whips to settle this, we can all get laced
Take a boat cruise, sip daquiris and max swimmin pools
Fly jewels Wally shoes blow stacks relax kid
black kids got a cravin for grapes until we get back
I'm packed leave the Mac that you're with
but whatever, I gotta hit other sides of the Earth
Spread Wu-ness, foolish, civilization's cursed
But luckily I'm born to be wild and aure-al 
Move crowds collect twenty thou and then we out
Heavy convoys my crew keep pretty boys paranoid
Blow like a steroid pat Dan's they're Akyroid
My seeds growin his seeds marry his seeds
that's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family





my seeds growin his seeds marry his seeds
that's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family

(it's been a long time...
since Wu-Tang family came to shine...)
