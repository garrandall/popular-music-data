You're a fancy dancer, yeah (fancy dancer)
You're a fancy dancer, well sing (fancy dancer) ow
You're a fancy dancer, yeah (fancy dancer)
You're a fancy dancer, well sing (fancy dancer) ow

Visions of you, my love, dancin' in my head
Girl, you know there's only one thing I can say, yeah

You're a fancy dancer, yeah (fancy dancer)
You're a fancy dancer, well sing (fancy dancer) ow
You're a fancy dancer, yeah (fancy dancer)
You're a fancy dancer, well sing
