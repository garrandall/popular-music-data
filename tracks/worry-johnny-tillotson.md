Worry the nights away worry all through the day
I worry what's come over you
Worry somehow you've changed worry you seem so strange
I worry what am I gonna do

Your lips keep saying that you care
But your heart just isn't there
And your eyes reveal the lies your lips have told
No use pretending nothing's wrong
Guess I've known it all along
I'm slowly losing you and all that I can do

Is worry the nights away worry all through the day
I worry I'm so in love with you
(That's why I worry) I'm so in love with you
