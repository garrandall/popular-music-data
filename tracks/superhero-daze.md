I need a super hero lover
(Super lover, super lover)
I need a super hero lover
(I e yeah e oh)
I need a super hero lover
(super lover, super lover)
I need a super hero lover
(i e yeah ee oh)

She was walking down the street that night
Singin' mmmbop a ay yah
All the was she thought, I want that guy
Singin' mmmbop a ay yah

He was driving all alone that night
Singin' mmmbop a ay yah
All the was he thought, his
Singin' mmmbop a ay yah

They just want each other
They don't need no other
