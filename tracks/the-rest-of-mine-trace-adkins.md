There's no guarantee that we'll see tomorrow
Heaven only knows how long we have
So there's no way I'll ever for one second let you wonder
Just how long my love for you will last

'Til my last breath, 'til I'm called on high
'Til the angels come and I see the light
To the very end, 'til I give in
To the last beat of my heart
No I can't swear that I'll be here for the rest of your life
But I swear I'll love you for the rest of mine

'Til my last breath, 'til I'm called on high
'Til the angels come and I see the light
To the very end, 'til I give in
To the last beat of my heart
No I can't swear that I'll be here for the rest of your life
But I swear I'll love you for the rest of mine

No I can't swear that I'll be here for the rest of your life
But I swear I'll love you for the rest of mine
