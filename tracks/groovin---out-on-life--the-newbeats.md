I get my kicks
From watching people
Running to and fro
I bet if you asked them
Where they're going
Half of them don't know

And they're the ones
Who think I'm crazy
But they don't realize
That I'm just grooving
Grooving
Grooving out on life

And I keep grooving
Grooving
Grooving till I die

To see a river
Floating by me
Heading for the sea
I get a feeling
Deep inside me
So good to be free

To have the sunshine
In the daytime
The moonlight every night
It keeps me grooving
Grooving
Grooving out on life

And I keep grooving
Grooving
Grooving till I die

To watch the sunrise
In the morning
Just takes my breath away
And I just know
That I'll be in for
Another perfect day

I thank the lord
For all he gave me
It's so good to be alive

I keep grooving
Grooving
Grooving out on life

And I keep grooving
Grooving
Grooving till I die

I keep grooving
Grooving
Grooving out on life
