Many a year I was so confused
and didn't know what to play
But then I met a man who picked up his horn
and showed me just what to say

He was skinny and lean and he kept himself clean
and he knew how to write them tunes
Then came a day when we started to play
And you know we conquered the moon


I'm in a band
A rock and roll band
I'm in a band

We called him Beethoven and then we showed them

Exactly where we wanted to go
So we started a band and toured all the land
A-rakin' in all of that dough

We smoked a few cigs and we played a few gigs
and never missed nearly a one
We covered the States and we hit the Great Lakes
And boy, did we have us some fun



We had an idea so we put it in gear
and soon we were out on the road
We did it to play and they started to say
The Animal Trainer and the Toad
