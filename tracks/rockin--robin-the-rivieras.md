Well, he rocks in the treetop all the day long
Rocking and a-bopping and singing a song
All the little birds on Sunset Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet, tweet, tweet

Rocking robin
Come on and go, rocking robin
You really go, rocking robin
'Cause you're really gonna rock tonight

Every little swallow, out across the sea
Back from Capistrano, where we oughta be
Every single bird in Californ-i-a
Gather 'round the robin singin' hey, hey hey

Rocking robin
Come on and go, rocking robin
You really go, rocking robin
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight

Well, a pretty little raven round 'Frisco Bay
Went flirtin' with the robin all through the day
They started going steady and bless my soul
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriole

He rocks in the treetop all the day long
Hopping and a-bopping and singing a song
All the little birds on Sunset Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet, tweet, tweet

Rocking robin
Come on now, go, rocking robin
Yeah, go, rocking robin
Hey, rock, rock, rock tonight



Oh well, a pretty little raven round 'Frisco Bay
A-flew with the robin all through the day
They started going steady and bless my soul
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriole

Every little swallow, out across the sea
Back from Capistrano, where he oughta be
Every single bird in Californ-i-a
Gather 'round the robin singin' hey, hey hey

Rocking robin
Come on and go, rocking robin
Hey now, go, rockin' robin
'Til I rock, rock, rock tonight
