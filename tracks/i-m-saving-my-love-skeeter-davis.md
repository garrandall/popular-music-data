I'm saving my love for someone who loves me
For someone who loves me the way I loved you
I'm saving my lips for someone to kiss me
For someone to kiss me the way I kissed you

Time after time I've waited for your caress
Time after time I've waited in loneliness
I'm saving my dreams for someone to dream of
For someone to dream of like I dreamed of you

Time after time I've waited for your caress
Time after time I've waited in loneliness
I'm saving my love for someone who loves me
For someone who loves me the way I loved you...
