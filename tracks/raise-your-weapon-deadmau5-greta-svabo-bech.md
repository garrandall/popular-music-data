Rippin' my heart was so easy, so easy,
Launch your assault now, take it easy.

Raise your weapon, raise your weapon, one word and it's over.

Rippin' through like a missile,
Rippin' through my heart,
Rob me of this love.

Raise your weapon, raise your weapon... and it's over.

Love your ego, you won't feel a thing,
Always number one, the pen with a bent wrist crooked king,
Sign away our peace for your war,
One word and it's over.

Dropping your bombs now
On all we've built,
How does it feel now
To watch it burn, burn, burn?

Raise your weapon, raise your weapon... and it's over.

Rippin' through like a missile,
Rippin' through my heart,
Rob me of this love.

Raise your weapon, raise your weapon... and it's over.

How does it feel now to watch it burn, burn, burn?

Rippin' my heart was so easy, so easy,
Launch your assault now, take it easy.

Raise your weapon, raise your weapon, one word and it's over.

Rippin' through like a missile,
Rippin' through my heart,
Rob me of this love.

Raise your weapon, raise your weapon... and it's over.

Love your ego, you won't feel a thing,
Always number one, the pen with a bent wrist crooked king,
Sign away our peace for your war,
One word and it's over.

Dropping your bombs now
On all we've built,
How does it feel now
To watch it burn, burn, burn?

Raise your weapon, raise your weapon... and it's over.
