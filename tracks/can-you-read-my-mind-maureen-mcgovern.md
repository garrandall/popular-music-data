Can you read my mind?
Do you know what it is you do to me?
Don't know who you are
Just a friend from another star

Here I am like a kid at a school
Holding hands with a god, I'm a fool
Will you look at me quivering
Like a little girl shivering?
You can see right through me

Can you read my mind?
Can you picture the things I'm thinking of?
Wondering why you are
All the wonderful things you are

You can fly, you belong to the sky
You and I could belong to each other

If you need a friend
I'm the one to fly to
If you need to be loved (to be loved)
Here I am, read my mind!

Will you look at me quivering
Like a little girl shivering?
You can see right through me

If you need a friend
I'm the one to fly to
If you need to be loved
Here I am, read my mind!

Read my mind!
