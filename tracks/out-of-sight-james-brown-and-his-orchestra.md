You got your high-heeled sneakers on
Slip-in mules
You got your high-heeled sneakers on
And your slip-in mules
You're more than alright
You know you're out of sight
You got a shapely figure mama
That's keepin' me uptight
You got a shapely figure mama
And keep me uptight
You're too much
You know you're out of sight

Hey, the way you do the things you do
The way you kiss me too
The way you do the things you do
The way you kiss me too
A heart delight, that's what you are
You know you're out of sight

Ho, hey, hey

You got a sweet disposition
Ho, you're always right
You got a sweet disposition
You know you're always right
You know just what you're doin' baby
You know you're out of sight

Ow, you're too much
You're the end
You're so hip baby
You know just where it's at
You're beautiful mama
Most of all, you're honest
There's no doubt, you're out of sight
Out of sight, whoo, wee
Out of sight
