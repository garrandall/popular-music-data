I like it-like it
I like it-like it
I like it-like it
I I like it-like it
I like it-like it
I like it-like it
I like it-like it

Na na na na
Come on (I like it-like it)
Na na na na
Come on (I I like it-like it)
Na na na na na
Come on (I like it-like it)
Na na na na
Come on, come on, come on
Na na na na na na

Feels so good being bad (Oh uh, oh oh uh)
There's no way I'm turning back (Oh uh, oh oh uh)
Now the pain is my pleasure cause nothing could measure (Oh uh, oh oh uh)

Love is great, love is fine (Oh uh, oh oh uh)
Out the box, outta line (Oh uh, oh oh uh)
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more (Oh uh, oh oh uh)

Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Na na na na
Come on, come on, come on
I like it-like it
Come on, come on, come on (Na na na)
I like it-like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it-like it
Come on, come on, come on

Just one night full of sin (Oh uh, oh oh uh)
Feel the pain on your skin (Oh uh, oh oh uh)
Ten bottles, scream mercy, it's your turn to hurt me (Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!)

If I'm bad, tell me that (Oh uh, oh oh uh)
Shut me up, gag and bound... me (Oh uh, oh oh uh)
Cause the pain is my pleasure, nothing comes better (Yeah, Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!)

Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Na na na na
Come on, come on, come on
I like it-like it
Come on, come on, come on (Na na na)
I like it-like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it-like it
Come on, come on, come on

S-S-S and M-M-M
S-S-S and M-M-M

Oh, I love the feeling you bring to me, oh you turn me on
That's exactly what I've been yearning for, give it to me strong
And meet me in my boudoir, make my body say ah ah ah
I like it-like it

Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Na na na na
Come on, come on, come on
I like it-like it
Come on, come on, come on (Na na na)
I like it-like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it-like it
Come on, come on, come on

S-S-S and M-M-M
S-S-S and M-M-M
S-S-S and M-M-M
S-S-S and M-M-M

(Uh!)
