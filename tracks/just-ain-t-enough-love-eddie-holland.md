Oh, just ain't enough love
Oh, just ain't enough love


These are the words my baby spoke
As she bid her last goodbye
With tears in my eyes as she walked from my side
I sadly asked her why


And she said, "Oh, oh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
She said, "Oh, oh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")


Now I was too busy, but that girl of mine
I'd buy her gifts from time to time
So sure this would satisfy, 'til she up and left me
With this reply


She said, "Oh, oh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love") I gotta leave you
Because, "Oh, oh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
She said, She said, "Oh, oh," that's what she told me
("Just ain't enough love")
And she said, "Oh, oh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")


I said, sweet thing, sweet thing, please don't leave
I'm so sorry I made you grieve
So confident pretty words would make her stay
But this is what she said
As she turned and walked away


She said, "Oh, oh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
She said, "Oh, oh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
Ain't enough love, baby, ("Oh, oh,")
That's what she told me ("Just ain't enough love")
Ain't enough love baby ("Oh, oh,")
That's what she said I got to move on ("Just ain't enough love")
Oh baby, ain't enough love
