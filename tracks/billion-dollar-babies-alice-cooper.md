Billion dollar baby
Rubber little lady, slicker than a weasel
Grimy as an alley
Loves me like no other lover

Billion dollar baby
Rubber little monster, baby, I adore you
Man or woman living couldn't love me like you, baby

We go dancing nightly in the attic
While the moon is rising in the sky
If I'm too rough, tell me
I'm so scared your little head will come off in my hands

Billion dollar baby
I got you in the dimestore
No other little girl could ever hold you
Any tighter, any tighter than me, baby

Billion dollar baby
Reckless like a gambler, million dollar maybe
Foaming like a dog that's been infected by the rabies

We go dancing nightly in the attic
While the moon is rising in the sky
If I'm too rough, tell me
I'm so scared your little head will come off in my hands

Million dollar baby
Billion dollar baby
Trillion dollar baby
Zillion dollar baby
