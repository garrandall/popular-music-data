What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
I'm never coming back down
Can't you see
I could but wouldn't stay?
I wouldn't put it like that

What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
I'm never coming around
It'd be so sweet if
Things just stayed the same
La-da-da-da-da

All the lights couldn't put out the dark
Running through my heart
Lights up and they know who you are
Know who you are
Do you know who you are?

(Shine)
Step into the light (Shine)
So bright sometimes (Shine)
I'm not ever going back

(Shine)
Step into the light (Shine)
So bright sometimes (Shine)
I'm not ever going back

(Shine)
Step into the light (Shine)
So bright sometimes (Shine)
I'm not ever

What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
I'm never going back now
It'd be so sweet if
Things just stayed the same
La-da-da-da-da

La-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da

All the lights couldn't put out the dark
Running through my heart
Lights up and they know who you are
Know who you are
Do you know who you are?
