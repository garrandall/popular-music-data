Another time, another place
Her candles flicker in the fading light
I sit alone and watch that lonely night
I see you everywhere and I try desperately to hide

Another time, another place, I see that old familiar face
And I try hard to catch your eye
Another road, another mile, I see that old familiar smile
But you'll be with somebody new

Another night, another day, I'll see you standing in my way
I'll stop and say "hello, my friend"
Another place, another time, you'll tell me you've been doing fine
And walk away from me once more.

I try to run away from sad regrets
The bitter wine won't help me to forget
That I locked up my heart and threw away the precious key 

Another time, another place, I see that old familiar face
And I try hard to catch your eye
Another road, another mile, I see that old familiar smile
But you'll be with somebody new

Another night, another day, I'll see you standing in my way
I'll stop and say "hello, my friend"
Another place, another time, you'll tell me you've been doing fine
And walk away from me once more.
