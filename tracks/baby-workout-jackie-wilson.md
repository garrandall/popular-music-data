Hey, you!
Come out here on the floor.
Let's rock some more.
Come out here on the floor,
Honey, let's rock some more, yeah!

Now when you get out here
Don't you have no fear.
Put your hands on your hip
And let your backbone slip
And work out.

Oh, my momma, move up (first step),
Party move back (second step),
Shuffle to the left (third step),
Wobble to the right (fourth step).

Now it's plain to see
You put a hurtin' on me
But it's a natural fact
I like it like that,
So work out!

Yeah, baby work out (work baby, work out)!
Honey, work out!
Ah, baby work out!
Shout and turn the joint out!
Work out!
Work out!
Work all night long!
Yeah, yeah! (round and around and around and around)
Baby, round and round we go.
Don't you know, don't you know?
Round and round we go,
Where we stop, nobody knows.
The band is swinging on the stand,
We're moving in, we're moving out.
Then we'll step back now and end this dance with a shout,
So work out!

Now when I tell you to shout I want you to jump at it!
Yeah, let's shout, baby, let's shout! (shout baby shout)
Honey, let's shout!
Baby, let's shout!
Yeah, shout and turn it out, baby!
Let's shout, let's shout, shout all night long!
I gotta have it just one more time,
Now here we go!
Round and round we go,
Now work out, work out, work all night long!
Work out, baby!
Work out woman!
Shout and turn the joint out!
Work out, work out, baby, baby...
