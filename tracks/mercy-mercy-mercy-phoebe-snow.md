We see these manifold expressions
All at once on his face
And that's when we make our confession
He has conquered inner space
Take your children home
I am one, I am one
Take your children and tell them
All the peoples of the world
Should be as one
So take your children home
I am one

He kept on tickling us until
We laughed screamingly for mercy
And we marveled at his skill
He said I'm glad you didn't curse me
He might be my demise
Cause he's such a good magician
I'd like to get behind his eyes
And sing and cry from that position
