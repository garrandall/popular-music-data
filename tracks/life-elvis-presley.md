A water glass full of whiskey
And women that I never knew too well
Lord, the things I've seen and done
Most of which I'd be ashamed to tell


I don't know how it started
But that's what makes a man a man, I guess
Now I'm holding on to nothing
Trying' to forget the rest


I'm looking back on my life
To see if I can find the pieces
I know that some were stolen
And some just blew away
Well, I found the bad parts
Found all the sad parts
But I guess I threw the best part away
Lord away, away


Playin' the bars, playin' like a star
Anything to get a name
Carryin' on, livin' on songs
My friends wrote for me to sing


I'm looking back on my life
To see if I can find the pieces
I know that some were stolen
And some just blew away
Well, I found the bad parts
Found all the sad parts
But I guess I threw the best parts away
Away, away


Lord, the pieces of my life
They're everywhere, they're everywhere
And the one I think I miss most of all
Is you and you know who

Looking back on my life Lord
To see if I can find the pieces
Looking back on my life today
To see if I can find the pieces
Looking back on my life
God help me find the pieces
