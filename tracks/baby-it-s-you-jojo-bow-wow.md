OoooohhaaaahhhhhOhhhaaaahhhh.......


Can somebody explain to me
Why everybody is trying to be
Living like a celebrity
Doing what they see on MTV.
Ice is cool but I am looking for more, simple things is what my heart beats for. 

Cause its me 
I don't ask for much 
Baby 
Having you is enough


You ain't got to buy nothing
It's not what I want
Baby it's You
We don't have to go nowhere
Its not what I want
Baby it's you
It's not for what you got 
Cause I know you got alot 
No matter what you do
You always gettin Hot
It's You,
It's You
Baby all I want is You Yeah


It don't matter that your car is fly 
And your rims are spinning on the side and 
It don't matter where we go tonight 
Cause if I'm with you I'll be alright. 
That's cool but I'm lookin for more 
Its your love that my heart beats for.

Cause thats me 
Don't have to spend a dime 
Baby
I just want your time.




5,4,3,2,1
Babygirl don't care bout' my dough stack
And she get down chick
And she knows I love that
She sees past all these Bow Wow stuff
B'cos she knows at the end of the day,
The only thing that matters is us
And there be a lot of groupies on the road
But they can't do nothing for me
I gotta good girl back at home
Matching Charm bracelets and pendants
Whoever wouldv'e thought our relationship will be so tremendous
And lately you've been missing me crazy
And anytime you miss me baby sidekick page me
I got a dime piece you know she's the bomb
The type of girl you bring back home just ta meet your mum
I'm not Lorenz Tate, but I think I'm caught in love Jones
Cuz I think bout' her every time I hear a slow songs
And when she thinks about me
I think about her too
When she ride for me
Baby I'm a ride for you
Let's go


Yeah Yeah Yeaey Yeahey Ye Ye Yeay......
