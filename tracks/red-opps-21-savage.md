I just bought a benz so I'm wood grain gripping
Pull up on you right now anybody get it
You know where to find me I'm the princess in my city
Lil buddy must be tripping really rapping how I'm living
I'm on southside with it
Riverdale with it
Old nat with it
College park with it
Highway 85 with it
Godby road with it
Grove street with it
Tara boulevard with it

I'm on southside with it 
Don't let me catch you slipping
Everywhere I go 50 deep
Have you swimming
Have you sleeping with the fishes 
No pacific, be specific when you dissing
Must be tripping come up missing no magician
Don't think that its sweet cause I'm on your TV tho
I'm cute but it gets ugly when I'm off the TV show
Please bring me some tp I'm the Sugar Honey Ice Tea
Something like a nightmare, these kids don't wanna see me

I just bought a benz so I'm wood grain gripping
Pull up on you right now anybody get it
You know where to find me I'm the princess in my city
Lil buddy must be tripping really rapping how I'm living
I'm on southside with it
Riverdale with it
Old nat with it
College park with it
Highway 85 with it
Godby road with it
Grove street with it
Tara boulevard with it

Lil girl, big boss all I hang with big dogs
All these kids they scared of me
Make em jump like Criss Cross
That thang same like Vandross
Flow nasty like no draws
I'm dripping like soy sauce
These rappers they broke they need red cross
I think these rappers they punk
Dressed in all black like a nun
This mouth they want none
I am at the top like a bun
You below me like a bunk bed
I got beef if they want that
Out in France getting to the french bread
And if they sleeping on me
Imma put em on they death bed

I just bought a benz so I'm wood grain gripping
Pull up on you right now anybody get it
You know where to find me I'm the princess in my city
Lil buddy must be tripping really rapping how I'm living
I'm on southside with it
Riverdale with it
Old nat with it
College park with it
Highway 85 with it
Godby road with it
Grove street with it
Tara boulevard with it
