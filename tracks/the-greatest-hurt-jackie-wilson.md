Oh the greatest hurt
The heart will ever know
Is when the one you love
Says she can't love you anymore
The pain that you feel
Is too much to conceal
As she slowly turns and walks towards the door

Yes

The saddest words to ever reach the heart
Are those cold, final words just before teardrops start
You wonder, yes you do, what's left in life for you
When the pain begins to burn in your heart

Then somewhere deep down inside you
You search to defend your pride
But all that you find deep down inside you
Are reflected by the tears that fill your eyes

You want to speak, huh
But words don't seem to flow
You want to cry baby, baby, baby please don't go, don't go
But then without a sigh she bids that last goodbye
Then she turns away and walks out the door

The greatest hurt
The greatest hurt
The greatest hurt
The heart has ever, ever known
