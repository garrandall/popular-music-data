Just a small town Cinderella
Daddy wants you back home by midnight
Every time we're together
Yeah, that's my dilemma
I need more time with ya
I wanna watch the sun rise through the pines with ya

Night like this, wouldn't wanna miss
Moonlight shining on a long slow kiss
You can be the one I can get lucky with
If the boot fits

Woah
Diamonds in the sky lighting up those eyes like
Whoa
You're the kind of fine that I can't deny
It gets me high, cross my heart hope to die
Pick a star make a wish
Yeah girl, you can be my all night
Dancing in the headlights
Fairytale good as it gets
If the boot fits

Yeah baby we can run away
My carriage is a 4x4 400 horse Chevrolet
You're like a princess,
In a blue cotton dress
I can be your prince

Woah
Diamonds in the sky lighting up those eyes like
Woah
You're the kind of fine that I can't deny
It gets me high, cross my heart, hope to die
Pick a star make a wish
Yeah girl, you can be my all night
Dancing in the headlights
Fairytale good as it gets
If the boot fits

Woah
Let me show you how a country boy treats a lady
Woah
Go ahead kick em off cuz the boot fits baby

Woah
Diamonds in the sky lighting up those eyes like
Woah
You're the kind of fine that I can't deny
It gets me high
Cross my heart, hope to die
Pick a star make a wish
Yeah girl, you can be my all night
Dancing in the headlights
Fairytale good as it gets
If the boot fits

Whoa
Mmm if the boot fits
Whoa
Yeah if the boot fits
