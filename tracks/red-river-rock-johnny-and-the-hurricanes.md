Paddy O'Brian left Ireland in glee;
He had a strong notion old England to see;
He shipped in the Nellie, for England was bound
And the whiskey he drank made his head go around

Laddy whack, fol de dol, fol de rol I dee dee

O, Paddy been never sailing before;
It made his heart ache when he heard the loud roar;
For the glance of his eye, a whale he did spy:
"I'm going to be ate," says Paddy, "by-and-by"

O, Paddy run forward and caught hold of the mast
He grasped his arms round and there he held fast
The boat gave a tip, and, losing his grip
Down in the whale's belly poor Paddy did slip

He was down in the whale six months and five days
Till luck one day to his throat he did pop
The whale give a snort and then give a blow
And out on the land poor Paddy did go

O, Paddy is landed and safe on the shore;
He swears that he'll never go to sea any more
The next time he wishes old England to see
It will be when the railroad runs over the sea
