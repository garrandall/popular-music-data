Tears and roses, tears and roses
Remind me that we're through but I'm still in love with you
(Tears and roses, tears and roses)

Today I passed a flower shop and in the window there
Were dozens of red roses like the ones you used to wear
I walked on by and when I saw a little baby cry
I thought about the tears that fell the day you said "Goodbye"

Tears and roses, tears and roses
Remind me that we're through but I'm still in love with you
(Tears and roses, tears and roses)

I think about the good old days when we were so in love
And I was still the only one that you were dreamin' of
I'd send a million roses and my tears would fill the sea
If all those tears and roses could bring you back to me

Tears and roses, tears and roses
Remind me that we're through but I'm still in love with you
Remind me that we're through but I'm still in love with you
(Tears and roses, tears and roses)
