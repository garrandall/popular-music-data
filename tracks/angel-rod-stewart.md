Angel came down from heaven yesterday
stayed with me long enough to rescue me
And she told me a story yesterday
about the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea
Then she spread her wings high over me
she said she's goin' now, come back tomorrow
And I said, "Fly on my sweet angel, fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side"

Fly away, high away, fly away

Sure enough this morning came unto me
silver wings silhouetted against a child's sunrise
And my angel she said unto me
Today's the day for you to rise
Take my hand, you're gonna be my man, you're gonna rise
Then she took me high over yonder

And I said, "Fly on my sweet angel, fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel forever I will be by your side"
And I said, "Fly on my sweet angel, fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel forever I will be by your side"
Fly away, come back another day
