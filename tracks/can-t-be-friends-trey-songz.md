Its crazy.. You kept me on this pedestal no matter how much I let you down too long too long too long.
Now you trapped... My love 4 U ain't going nowhere nowhere (Just me 4 U) Onlyyyy (Just me 4 U) Onlllyyy (Me 4 U) Onnllyyy (My love 4 U)
She told me I'm dieing I'm trying to survive never be enough if its just (Just me 4) now she question if its real when I say I
I love You You (My Love 4 U)


I guess its hard to feel when I'm never even there. Actions speak louder than words and they say I don't care.
(My love 4 U) But I know its in my heart if you can hold it right now you see its only beating cuz you hold a nigga down think about that for a second now baby...
un un un un Woop! I cant say its right when I'm running through the night you're my shining star cant afford to lose your light.
So busy doing wrong Will I ever get it right for you?


She deserves something better and she know she does but I'm never gonna let her cuz she knows my love.
(My Love for you) You can never find another man (Just me 4 U) Cuz I ain't never gonna understand if it ain't me 4 u me 4 u.
Even tho I'm doing wrong girl you can never move along girl cuz its just juuust me 4 u


Me 4 U & U 4 me that's the way its gotta be even tho I'm in the streets fucking with these fucking freaks stupidly truthfully I know you been so thru with me you put up with my foolery I guess you got so used to me and my infidelity and thru the bad you saw the better man in me you picked me up every time they put me down you try to leave me Imma tie you to the ground.
Baby look what you've allowed
Baby look what you've allowed
Baby look what you've allowed and I never find no nigga in my house
(who who that talking in the background huh?)


She deserves something better and she know she does but ill never gonna let her kill a nigga dead that's just (My Love for you)
You can never find another man (Just me 4 U) Cuz I ain't never gonna understand if it ain't me 4 u Just me 4 u u.
Even tho I'm doing wrong girl you can never move along girl cuz its just juuust me 4 u



 It meant nothing I was helping her thats all
 The way you helped me?
 I thought she was your friend?
 So you wouldn't fuck her?
 That language does not become you
 yes. you'd rather I be demure
 I'd rather you be rational
 Meaning what? That I say nothing about what I see what I hear?
 What have you heard?
 That you're capable of anything
 Well if you didn't tell me about then it couldn't have been very upsetting
 You make me sick to my stomach. This whole arrangement of...
 What arrangement?
 That I do accept what you tell me and there's nothing more.
That I aid you in the business you conduct and pretend I don't now what that business is.
 I don't recall you ever saying no to anything I put in front of you.
You make a little noise every now and then to remind me what a good person you are but a good person wouldn't be here right now.
