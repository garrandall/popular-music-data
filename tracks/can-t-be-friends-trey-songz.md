Look what this girl done did to me
She done cut me off from a good, good love
She told me that those days were gone


Now I'm sitting here going half crazy
'Cause I know she still thinks about me too
And it ain't no way in hell
That I can be just friends with you


And I wish we never did it
And I wish we never loved it
And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you
And now it ain't no way we can be friends


The way it felt no faking it
Maybe we were moving just a little too fast
But what we've done, we can't take it back
(Back, back)


Now I'm sitting here halfway crazy
'Cause I know she still thinks about me too
And it ain't no way in hell
That I can be just friends with you


And I wish we never did it
And I wish we never loved it
And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you
And now it ain't no way we can be friends


And all I can say is
La la la la la la la, a
La la la la la la la la la, la la la oh
La la la la la la la la la la, hey
Ain't no telling what we could have been
Ain't no telling what we could have been, no


And if I knew it'd ends like this
I never would have kissed you 'cause I fell in love with you
We never would have kicked it, girl, now everything's different
I've lost my only lover and my friend


That's why I wish we never did it, woo
Oh yeah and I wish we never loved it
And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you
And now it ain't no way we can be friends
