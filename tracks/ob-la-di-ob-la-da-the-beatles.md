Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly, "Girl, I like your face"
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand


Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on


Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store (chu chu chu)
Buys a twenty carat golden ring (Ring)
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her, she begins to sing (Sing)


Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on
Yeah


In a couple of years they have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones (Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)


Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand (Arm, leg)
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band (Yes!)


Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on (heh-heh) (Yeah)
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on


In a couple of years they have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones (Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha) (Yeah)


Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand (Foot)
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening she's a singer with the band (Yeah)


Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on (Yeah)
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on


And if you want some fun
Take Ob-la-di-bla-da
(Ah)
Thank you
