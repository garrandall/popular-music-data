Desmond has his barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly, "Girl, I like your face"
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand

Ob-la-di ob-la-da life goes on brah
La-la how the life goes on
Ob-la-di ob-la-da life goes on brah
La-la how the life goes on

Desmond takes a trolley to the jewelry store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring (bling)
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing

Ob-la-di ob-la-da life goes on brah
La-la how the life goes on
Ob-la-di ob-la-da life goes on brah
La-la how the life goes on

In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones

Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond let's the children lend a hand
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band

Ob-la-di ob-la-da life goes on brah
La-la how the life goes on
Ob-la-di ob-la-da life goes on brah
La-la how the life goes on

In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones

Hey, happy ever after in the market place
Molly let's the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band

Ob-la-di ob-la-da life goes on brah
La-la how the life goes on
Ob-la-di ob-la-da life goes on brah
La-la how the life goes on

And if you want some fun
Take ob-la-di ob-la-da
