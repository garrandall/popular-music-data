Wish I could reach up and reset that sun
Reverse these wheels go back and re-pick you up
Went by so fast, oh, so sweet
Make me wanna remake a memory
Wish I had me a time machine

Oh, I float the moon back up in the sky
Put a cork back into that sweet red wine
Put your midnight hair back up
So you can let it fall one more time
Untouch your skin
Unkiss your lips and kiss 'em again
So good, so right,
This is one night I'm wishing I could rewind

I turn back that radio dial re-open your door,
Try to talk George Strait into giving us an encore
Re-spin you around
Replay that sound
Of you laughing when we hit the ground,
I can see it now how 'bout we

Float the moon back up in the sky,
Put a cork back into that sweet red wine
Put your midnight hair back up
So you can let it fall one more time
Untouch your skin
Unkiss your lips and kiss 'em again
So good, so right,
This is one night I'm wishing I could rewind

I wanna re-fall and re-fly
Baby, re-live this night

Float the moon back up in the sky,
Put a cork back into that sweet red wine
Put your midnight hair back up
So you can let it fall one more time
Untouch your skin
Unkiss your lips and kiss 'em again
So good, so right,
This is one night I'm wishing I could rewind

(Float the moon back up in the sky)
I'm wishing I could rewind
(put a cork back into that sweet red wine)
I wanna re-live this night
So good, so right
