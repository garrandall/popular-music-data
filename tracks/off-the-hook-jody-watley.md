You're off the hook

Unlike my past relations
You were into more than friendly datin', yeah
Well, you didn't have time for games
You were ready to stake your claim
And I felt just the same way about you

It started out with just one touch
But little did I know I'd get this much
Lovin' (oh, kissin' (ah), huggin' (ah)
From just one man, you're...

Off the hook
And your love is unexplainable
Oh, baby, you're off the hook
And your love is so untamable
Between us there's fire (fire)
My only desire (desire)
Is being with you, boy
'Cause you know just what to do
Oh, oh, oh, oh

It really turns me on
How my man is so sensitive and warm
Well, well, well
He knows what I want and need
At any cost he'll give it to me
And I'll do just the same for my man, oh, yeah

Never been so happy, boy
Your love is off the hook
And why should I complain, baby
Crazy, insane, I lose my cool over you
Your lovin' (oh, kissin' (ah)
Huggin' (ah), from just one man, you're

(Just one touch) started with just a touch
(I know) mmm, mmm, mmm (oh
The kissin' (ah), the huggin' (ah), the lovin'
(Just one touch) mmm, damn
(I know) it's off the hook (oh, yeah (ah, ah)

Off the hook
And your love is unexplainable
Oh, baby, you're off the hook
And your love is so untamable
We don't need no other (no other)
'Cause we got each other
And baby, it's all good, yeah, yeah
Your love is off the hook
Oh, boy you're

Off the hook (oh, oh, oh, oh)
And your love is unexplainable (yeah, yeah)
Oh, baby (off the hook)
You're off the hook
And your love is so
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) untamable
Between us there's fire (fire)
My only desire
'Cause baby, it's all good, yeah, yeah
Your love is off the hook
