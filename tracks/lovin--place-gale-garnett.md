Summer has come and gone
You have gone too
You were my summer song
My skies are blue

But with the Autumn skies
My skies turn grey
You were my lovin' place
You've gone away
And now that lovin' place
Stays on my mind, oh yeah
Gonna leave this lonely place behind

You werent meant to stay
Your heart runs free
I thought you'd change your ways
For love only
I still can hear your voice
Ring in the air
But when I turn around
Woah, you are not there

And still that loving place
Stays on my mind, oh yeah
Gonna leave this lonely place behind

I've cried a little?
Remembering, the way you used to laugh
The way you'd sing
I'll wait and watch the trains
Hauling through
As they pull into town
Well, I'll be lookin' for you

Because that lovin' place
Stays on my mind, oh yeah
Gonna leave this lonely place behind
Gonna leave this lonely place behind
