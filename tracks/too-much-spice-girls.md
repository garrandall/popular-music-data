Love is blind, as far as the eye can see
Deep but meaningless words to me
Easy lover, I need a friend
Road to nowhere, twist and turns but will this never end


Well my dear you'll know that he pleases me (pleases me)
But short term solution ain't no resolution
That ain't no release for me


Too much of something is bad enough
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied


Unwrap yourself from around my finger
Hold me too tight or left to linger
Something fine built to last
Slipped up there, I guess we're running out of time too fast


Yes my dear you know he soothes me (moves me)
There's no complication, there's no explanation
It's just a groove in me


Too much of something is bad enough (bad enough)
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough (just as tough)
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied


What part of no don't you understand
(understand, understand)
I want a man not a boy who thinks he can
Boy who thinks he can


Too much of something is bad enough
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied


Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie
Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie
Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie
