Look up at the sun but when I see it, I just close my eyes
Shawty wanna love me but I'm only seein' lies
Niggas wanted war, shoulda told me, choppa's make me cry
Bitches want in love with me but I'm only gettin' high
I'm so lovely, so wavy, I can never die
Feelin' like I'm James Bond, cruisin' with the black tie
Stupid bitches tryna play me like I'm the bad guy
But I set it back, I close my eyes, look at the blue sky

Call my cell phone, I'm busy, you can call back tonight
I'm a wolf, sleep all the day, up at moonlight


Wake up in the morning then I grab myself some ice (Ah)
Every day is Christmas, you can see it in my eyes (Hahaha)
I don't got no time to talk so I grab myself my bike
Fine ass shawty lookin' good from the side (Who that?)
She the sun in my eyes and I'm so satisfied (Satisfied)
I ask for her number, "Please baby, let me slide" (Please)
She ask me for a ride and I just can't deny (Nah)
I asked her where she's from and she said, "Shanghai" (Shanghai)
Fuck what them niggas sayin', I'll kill 'em with a knife (Chew-chew)
Dropped that bitch off and she said goodbye (Au revoir)
I said, "See you later," and I flew to the sky (Haha)
Lovely nigga in the morning just can't die (Nah)
Wavy nigga walkin' and I'm always glorified (Glorified)
Lovely nigga with' a blade, nice hair with some suede (Yuh)
Chillin' at night, head low with some shade (Ayy)
Yuh (Hey, listen)


Look up at the sun but when I see it, I just close my eyes
Shawty wanna love me but I'm only seein' lies
Niggas wanted war, shoulda told me, choppa's make me cry

I'm so lovely, so wavy, I can never die
Feelin' like I'm James Bond, cruisin' with the black tie
Stupid bitches tryna play me like I'm the bad guy
But I set it back, I close my eyes, look at the blue sky (Blue sky)
