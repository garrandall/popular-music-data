(I'm lookin' for a love)
(I'm lookin' for a love)
Mmmm ... I'm looking for a love
(I'm lookin' for a love)
Lookin' for a love
(I'm lookin' for a love)
Well now
I'm lookin' here and there
And I'm searchin' everywhere
And I'm lookin, I'm lookin, I'm lookin, I'm lookin
Oh lookin' for a love to call my own


Well, someone to get up in the mornin' and rub my head
(I'm lookin' for a love to call my own)
Someone to fix my breakfast and bring it to my bed
(I'm lookin' for a love to call my own)
Someone to do a little housework and back with me again
(I'm lookin' for a love to call my own)
Well now with lots of love and kisses and people until then
(I'm lookin' for a love to call my own)


I'll be lookin' for a love
(I'm lookin' for a love)
I'm lookin' for a love
(Oh-oh-oh-oh I'm lookin' for a love)
Well well well
I'm lookin' here and there
And I'm searchin' everywhere
I'm lookin, I'm lookin, I'm lookin, I'm lookin
Oh lookin' for a love to call my own


Yes, someone to be in my corner all the way
(I'm lookin' for a love to call my own)
She'll be working to the end no matter what the people say
(I'm lookin' for a love to call my own)
I'll give her my love to soothe her all the time
(I'm lookin' for a love to call my own)
I'll be glad to have her know that she's mine, all mine
(I'm lookin' for a love to call my own)


But right now I'm lookin' for a love
(I'm lookin' for a love)
Let tell you
(I'm lookin' for a love)
Lookin' for a love
Woo-oo
I'm lookin' here and there
And I'm searching everywhere
And I'm lookin', I'm lookin', I'm lookin', I'm lookin'
Oh, I'm lookin' for a love to call my own
Well, I'm goin' lookin'
(I'm lookin' for a love)
(I'm lookin' yeah for a love)
(I'm lookin' yeah for a love)...
