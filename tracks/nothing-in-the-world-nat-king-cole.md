If I owned Aladdin's lamp
I'd make all your dreams come true
But nothing in the world
Could make me love you
More than I do

If I owned a magic clock
Then I'd keep our love brand new
But nothing in the world
Could make me love you
More than I do

Don't ever doubt my feelings
My love is real
My darling, I'm revealing
Exactly how I feel

If I owned a magic wand
I'd wave it for no one but you
But nothing in the world
Could make me love you
More than I do

My darling, I'm revealing
Exactly how I feel

If I owned a magic wand
I'd wave it for no one but you
But nothing in the world
Could make me love you
More than I do
