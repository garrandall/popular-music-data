Rainin' in my heart
Since we've been apart
I know I was wrong
Baby, please come home

You've got me cryin'
'Bout to lose my mind
Don't let me cry in vain
Try my love just once again

Honey, I need your love
Darlin', and you know why
If you'll only come back home
There'll be no need for me to cry

Rainin' in my heart
Since we been apart
I know I was wrong
Baby please come back home
