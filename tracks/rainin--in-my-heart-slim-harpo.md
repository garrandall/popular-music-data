Still rainin' in my heart
Baby, we still apart
Now I know that I was wrong
I need you baby, come on home

Since you been gone
I been cryin'
I've almost lost my mind
So far I've cried for you in vain
I need you baby, come on home, again

Spoken:
Honey, you played your part
But instead, I broke your heart
Now I know I wasn't so smart
That's why it's still rainin' in my heart

Still raining in my heart
Baby, we still apart
Now I know how I done ya wrong
Baby, please come on home
