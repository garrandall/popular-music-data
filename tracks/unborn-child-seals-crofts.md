Oh, little baby, you'll never cry
Nor will you hear a sweet lullaby

Oh, unborn child, if you only knew
Just what your momma was planning to do
You're still clinging to the tree of life
But soon you'll be cut off before you get ripe

Oh, unborn child, beginning to grow
Inside your momma but you'll never know

Oh, tiny bud, that grows in the womb
Only to be crushed before you can bloom

Mama, stop, turn around, go back, think it over
Stop, turn around, go back, think it over

Think of all the great ones who gave everything
That we might have a life here so please bear the pain

Mama, stop, turn around, go back, think it over
Stop, turn around, go back, think it over

Oh, turn around, think about it
Please, stop

Oh, little baby, you'll never cry
