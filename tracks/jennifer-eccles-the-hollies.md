White chalk, written on red brick
Our love, told in a heart
It's there, drawn in the playground
Love, kiss, hate or adore

I love Jennifer Eccles
I know that she loves me
I love Jennifer Eccles
I know that she loves me

I used to carry her satchels
She used to walk by my side
But when we got to her doorstep
Her dad wouldn't let me inside

One Monday morning,
Found out I'd made the grade
Started me thinking,
Had she done the same?

One Monday morning,
Found out I'd made the grade
Started me thinking,
Had she done the same?

I hope Jennifer Eccles
Is going to follow me there
Our love is bound to continue
Love, kiss, hate or adore

Singin'
I love Jennifer Eccles
I know that she loves me
I love Jennifer Eccles
I know that she loves me
