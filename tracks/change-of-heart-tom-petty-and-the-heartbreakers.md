You think you're gonna take her away
With your money and your cocaine
Keep thinkin' that her mind is gonna change
But I know everything is okay


She's gonna listen to her heart
It's gonna tell her what to do
Well, she might need a lot of lovin'
But she don't need you

You want me to think that I'm being used
You want her to think it's over
Can't you see it don't matter what you do
Buddy you don't even know her



And you just can't creep up behind her
And you can't understand that she's my girl
She's my girl
