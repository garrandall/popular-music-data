Well I fought for you
I fought too hard
To do it all again babe
It's gone too far
You never needed me
You only wanted me around
It gets me down

There's been a change
Yeah there's been a change of heart
Said there's been a change
You push just a little too far
You make it just a little to hard
There's been a change of heart

I'll get over you
It won't take long
I've stood in yer gallery
Seen what's hanging from the wall
You were the moon and sun
Yer just a loaded gun now
It gets me down


Looks like we finally found the turning point
Looks like it's time for me to kiss it goodbye
Kiss it goodbye
