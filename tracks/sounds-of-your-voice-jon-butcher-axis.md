La la la la la la la la
Oh, la la la la la la

The sounds of your voice in the night
They keep haunting me
The sounds of your voice late at night
They won't let me be

In the still, did I hear a sound?
A whisper like a ghost in my heart
It's so quiet, no one's around
I won't sleep tonight
I won't even start

It's so complicated these days
I wonder did we need to leave things this way

The sounds of your voice in the night
They won't let me be

I don't care where I'm sleeping
I don't care where I am
This frustration I feel each night
Will leave me a desperate man

But in my mind, I call your name

The sounds of your voice in the night
They keep calling me
The sounds of your voice in the night
They won't let me be

I wonder where you are
And if you feel all right
And I wonder if you're gone this time
'Cause somehow, I'll get right through this night

I can the hear the sounds of your voice in the night
They won't let me be
The sounds of your voice in the night

The sounds of your voice
I wonder where you were last night
I wonder if you feel all right

The sounds of your voice
La la la la la, yeah, yeah
The sounds of your voice

Where are they when I needed you
Oh, oh, I wonder where you were
I wonder where you are
