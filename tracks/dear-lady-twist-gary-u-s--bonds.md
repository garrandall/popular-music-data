Get up from your chair
Get up from your chair...

Darling, may I have
The pleasure of having
This next twist with you
I don't know how to twist
You don't know how to twist
No, well, let me tell you

Well now, there's a new dance
That's known as the twist
It's really not new
It's something you've missed

But there's a new dance
That's known as the twist
It's really not new
It's something you've missed

Dear lady
(Get up from your chair)
Dear, dear lady
(Get up from your chair)

Well, now, doctors agree

So I've been told
Do the twist and
You'll never grow old

Well, one night I happened
On a go-go dance
Believing I'd find
Me some romance

And this old lady
I happened to see
I said, come on, baby
Do the twist with me

Dear lady
(Get up from your chair)
Oh, dear lady
(Get up from your chair)

Well, now, doctors agree
So I've been told
Do the twist and
You'll never grow old

Get up and do the twist now
Yeah, oh, yeah

Well, I said, I'd love to
Dance from now until dawn
She said, thank you, baby
But I'm almost gone

I said, now the rhythm
Is getting real sweet
This is no time to
Slow up your feet

Dear lady
(Get up from your chair)
Dear, dear lady
(Get up from your chair)

Well, now, doctors agree
So I've been told
Do the twist and
You'll never grow old

You gotta do the twist
You gotta do the twist
