Won't you make love to me
Let it be, set me free
You and me so tenderly
Make love to me

I know what it's like to be loved
Cause I've been loved before
I know what it's like to be down
You know I fell before

I know what it's like to be lonely
I know what it's like to be blue

Won't you make love to me
Let it be, set me free
You and me so tenderly
Make love to me

Won't you make love to me
Let it be, set me free
You and me so tenderly
Make love to me

I know what it's like to be touched
Cause I've been touched before
I know what it's like to be a fool
I've been a fool before

I know what it's like to be lonely
I know what it's like to be blue

Won't you make love to me
Let it be, set me free
You and me so tenderly
Make love to me

Won't you make love to me
Let it be, set me free
You and me so tenderly
Make love to me

Won't you make love to me
Let it be, set me free
You and me so tenderly
Make love to me

Won't you make love to me
Let it be, set me free
You and me so tenderly
Make love to me
