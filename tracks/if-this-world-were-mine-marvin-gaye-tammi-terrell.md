If this world were mine
I would place at your feet
All that I own
You've been so good to me
If this world were mine

I'd give the flowers the birds and the bees
And it'd be your love beside me
That would be all I need
If this world were mine
I'd give anything

If this world were mine
I would make you a king
With wealth untold
You could have anything
If this world were mine

I'd give you each day so sunny and blue
And if you wanted the moonlight
I'd give you that too
If this world were mine, oh, baby
I'd give you anything

Oh, baby, you're my inspiration
And there's no hesitation
When you want me
Honey, just call me, oh

Oh, baby, you are my consolation
And I feel so much sensation
When I'm in your arms
When you squeeze me

Oh, the way that you do
Oh...the way that you love me
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, the way that you do

Oh...oh...every sky will be blue
As long as your loving me, baby (Ooh....)
Whoa...whoa...ho...
When you're here in my arms
Life is so wonderful, my love

Oh...oh...give me pretty lovin', baby
Give me pretty lovin', honey
Keep on lovin' me, baby
Whoa...oh...oh...
You know I need you, honey
You know I need you, baby
Keep on loving me

Lovin' me the way (The way) you do, my love
Oh...and I don't wanna let you go, wanna let you, wanna let you go, my love, no
Mmm...ooh...
You know the world would be yours
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah...hea... (Mmm...hmm...)
Yes, it would (Yes, it would)
The world would be yours (Yeah)
Baby (Baby)
Ooh...hoo...
It would be yours
If you'll believe
