She see money all around me
I look like I'm the man, yeah
But I was down and out like last week
Tell me where have you been?
You came out of hiding, girl
Don't act like I'm your man
You just a fan, you don't hold rank
Don't hold no rank


Dirty ass, Maryland ass nigga
With a sick ass mouth and a slick ass flow
Got your bitch around me, nigga, ain't no playin'
When I'm comin' for the kitty, I'm a fool, goddamn
Do it for my niggas on the coast right there
Do it for my niggas in the Ghost right now
Niggas got killed for the boy, live his dreams in the hills
And they watchin' for the boy right now
Goddamn, what a time, what a year, uh
We are what them young boys fear, uh
I kill, never been killed, that's real, no lies
You can tell that from our peers right now
Bet you wanna fuck me now, uh
Bet you wanna love me down, uh
Girl, you can't tie me down like Ray J said
But know I'm down, uh
Freaky deaky, show me somethin', uh
Shake it like you owe me somethin', uh
Pushin' on the pussy like a button
Came four times, fifth time you gushin', uh
Still gettin' rowdy in the function, uh
Bitches on my dick like it's nothin', uh
Everywhere I go now, always got shit bumpin'
Jumpin', thumpin', jumpin', yeah


Hey, nice to meet (Hey), I’m Young Jefe, who you be? (Young Jefe)
Got my piece in Southeast, got her clappin' to this beat (Clap, clap)
She invite me to her crib (Ow!), I walk in, she see my heat (Ow!)
She said, "But I live in the hills," (Girl) bitch, that’s just the way I sleep (Uh-huh)
Stop that madness, I'm a savage, in traffic with MAC 11’s (Brr)
Baddest bitch and she Spanish (Oo!), I fly her to Calabasas
We get nasty, I'm her daddy, she know a nigga ain't average (Uh)
Ain't nothin' wrong with fake asses (Uh), bitch, turn around, let's make magic
I'm geekin', uh-huh, I'm on it (Uh-huh), don't look at me like you want it (No)
Tell 'em that we ain't stuntin' (Uh-uh), in fourth down we ain't puntin' it (Woo!)
King of District Columbia, can't come here without a permit (Uh)
This shit really a jungle (Goddamn), gorillas and anacondas (Goddamn, goddamn)


She see money all around me (Hey Hey)
I look like I'm the man, yeah (Yung jefe holmes)
But I was down and out like last week
Tell me where have you been?
You came out of hiding, girl
Don't act like I'm your man
You just a fan, you don't hold rank
Don't hold no rank
