Day one
I stumbled through hello on 5th avenue
Day two
We grabbed a bite to eat and talked all afternoon
Caught a movie on day 14
And day 67 she said, "I love you" to me


Oh what a feeling
What a wonderful emotion
Yeah what a life
Counting my blessings and knowing
Oh we had our ups and downs all along the way
She had a chance to leave but chose to stay
What a beautiful day
What a beautiful day

Day 116
I asked her what she was doing for the rest of my life
Day 189
Oh I almost lost that girl to my foolish pride
She said, "I do" on day 482
And gave me a son on day 761



Day 18,253
Well honey, that's fifty years
Yeah, here's to you and me



Day one
I thank god I said hello on 5th avenue
