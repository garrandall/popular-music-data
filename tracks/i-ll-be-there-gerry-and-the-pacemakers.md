I've been a fool, yes, a fool to myself

To think that you were mine, I never thought you'd be so wild
You played around with everyone anytime at all
I thought you were bein' friendly
When you took them home to tea

I've been a fool, yes, a fool to myself
I've been a fool, yes, a fool to myself

When I used to ring you and you said you were ill in bed
I should have realized, yes, you were ill but in your head
There's only one thing left for me to say
And it's this, my friend

I've been a fool, yes, a fool to myself
I've been a fool, yes, a fool to myself

Life, I know, is not a dream
A dream of your A T
But must you go and try to make
Some kind of monkey out of me

If this life you're livin' suits your temperament and your face
I'm ever tryin' to change it, I'll leave you in disgrace
There's only one thing left for me to say
And it's this, my friend

I've been a fool, yes, a fool to myself
I've been a fool, yes, a fool to myself
