I call ya
You ain't in
What's this cold reaction
Where you been?
Oh baby
Layin' it on the line
If this is last call
And you say that's all you can take
It's fine

I'm sorry but
It don't make sense
You'd be a fool
If you just run out on first offense
Oh baby play it smart
Before you go south with your big mouth
Better check your heart

Danger there's a breakdown dead ahead
Maybe you're in way above your head
I may burn.. might upset you
But you know I'd never let you down

I told ya
No more lying
No more tears a falling
Stop your cryin'
Oh baby
I'm your man
Before you go back to your side track
Baby understand

Danger there's a breakdown dead ahead
And just maybe you're in way above your head
I may burn.. might upset you
But you know I'd never let you down
No no no
No no no no
No no no no no no no

Danger there's a breakdown dead ahead
And just maybe you're in way above your head
I may burn.. might upset you
But you know I'd never let you down
No no no

Danger there's a breakdown dead ahead
And just maybe you're in way above your head
I may burn.. might upset you
But you know I'd never let you down down down down
No no no oh oh oh
