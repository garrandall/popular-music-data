You say I sound silly when I laugh real loud
Talk about my day and you tune me out
You keep telling me lies to make things worse
But I donât hear you
âCause Iâm listening to his words

And he says I am beautiful
And when I fall
It donât matter that Iâm not perfect
I am beautiful
Iâm not alone
And in his eyes Iâm so worth it
Iâm worth every tear
And every scar
And even when you say Iâm not
He says Iâm beautiful

You say Iâll never be good enough
Knock me down
Wonât help me up
And you always say the right thing to make me hurt
But I donât hear you
âCause Iâm listening to his words

And he says I am beautiful
And when I fall
It donât matter that Iâm not perfect
I am beautiful
Iâm not alone
And in his eyes Iâm so worth it
Iâm worth every tear
And every scar
And even when you say Iâm not
He says Iâm beautiful

And I deserve better things
He says he understands
I got to do whats right for me

And he says I am beautiful
And when I fall
It donât matter that Iâm not perfect
I am beautiful
Iâm not alone
And in his eyes Iâm so worth it
Iâm worth every tear
And every scar
And even when you say Iâm not
He says Iâm beautiful
He says
He says
Iâm beautiful
And Iâm worth every tear
And every scar
And even when you say Iâm not
He says Iâm beautiful
