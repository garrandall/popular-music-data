Close your eyes, come with me
And we soon will be
In the wonderful world
Of the young

Hearts remain seventeen
Dreams are evergreen
In the wonderful world
Of the young

Fools may deny it
Wise men know the truth
They have discovered
That love is youth

Take this heart that I give
And we'll always live
In the wonderful world
Of the young

In the wonderful world
Of the young, mmmm
In the wonderful world
Of the young

Fools may deny it
Wise men know the truth
They have discovered
That love is youth

Take this heart that I give
And we'll always live
In the wonderful world
Of the young
