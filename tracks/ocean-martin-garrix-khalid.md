You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up
Just to get to your heart

Tell me what you're crying for
I'll wipe your tears, oh love
If your soul is aching love
We'll comfort you for sure

When my head goes in different directions
You know my heart's never on the move
And in the dark times you don't have to question
If I'm 100 with you

You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up
Just to get to your heart

Just to get to your hea-
Just to get to your heart
Just to get to your hea-
Just to get to your heart
Just to get to your hea-
Just to get to your heart
Just to get to your hea-

Shadows play on idle hands
I lose myself I do
But I've found my way to velvet sands
I'll crash right into you

When my head goes in different directions
You know my heart's never on the move
And in the dark times, you don't have to question
If I'm 100 with you

You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up
Just to get to your heart
If we're caught in a wave
Baby, we'll make a way
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart

Just to get to your hea-
Just to get to your heart
Just to get to your hea-
Just to get to your heart
Just to get to your hea-
Just to get to your heart
Just to get to your hea-

You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up
Just to get to your heart

Just to get to your heart
Just to get to your heart
Just to get to your heart
Just to get to your heart
Just to get to your heart
Just to get to your heart
Just to get to your heart
Just to get to your heart
