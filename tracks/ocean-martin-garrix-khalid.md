Tell me what you're crying for
I'll wipe your tears, oh love
If your soul is aching love
I'll comfort you for sure
If we're caught in a wave
I will carry you over
It don't matter where you are
I'll run to your front door


When my head goes in different directions
You know my heart's never on the move
And in the dark times you don't have to question
If I'm 100 with you


You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up
Just to get to your heart
If we're caught in a wave
Baby, we'll make a way
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could put an


Between our love, love, love, love, love
You could put an
Between our love, love, love, love, love
You could put an ocean


Shadows play on idle hands
I lose myself I do
But I've found my way to velvet sands
I'll crash right into you
If we're caught in a wave
I will carry you over
It don't matter where we are
You're still the one I choose


You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up
Just to get to your heart
If we're caught in a wave
Baby, we'll make a way
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could put an


Between our love, love, love, love, love
You could put an
Between our love, love, love, love, love
You could put an ocean
