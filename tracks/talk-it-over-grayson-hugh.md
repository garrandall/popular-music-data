Harsh words are spoken
Promises are broken
Old wounds are opened
And love walks out that door

Too proud to make up
You're ready to break up
Too late you wake up
And love walks out that door

Baby, oh sweet baby
I didn't mean a word that I said
(Well now) you know that I love you
Can't we talk it over in bed

I never meant to hurt you
Must have been out of my head
Tell me that you still want me
Can't we talk it over in bed
(talk, talk, talk it over)

Harsh words are spoken
Promises are broken
Old wounds are opened
And love walks out that door

Too proud to make up
You're ready to break up
Too late you wake up
And love walks out that door

Come on a little closer
Can't we just forgive and forget
Everything seems to work out
I never meant to hurt you
I must have been out of my head
Tell me that you still want me
Can't we talk it over in bed

Don't let it no don't let it slip away
Oh no baby oh
