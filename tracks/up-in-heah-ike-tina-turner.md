I used to live in the country, brought up by the old folks' rules
My pa was a preaching pastor, and my ma taught Sunday school
I was told about devilish people who lived just to do no good
All I knew was my religion, and how to serve the best I could
I always knew about the son of evil - could lead a woman to no good
Mm-hmm

He used to get me from the church window, telling me I wouldn't be missed
Promising we'd just hold hands, and maybe just one little kiss
It was hard on me, backsliding - I'm disowned by my family
But I'd do it all over again, that's how good it is to me
But now, I'm the daughter of evil, and I'm trying to get you up in heah, up in heah
Oh, up in heah, up in heah
Up in heah! (Up in heah...) Oh, up in heah... (Up in heah...)
Up in heah! (Up in heah...) Oh, oh... (Up in heah...)

It's hard on you when you leave home, and your people say you're on your own
When you're walkin' in the streets, and you haven't a meal all week
Oh! Oh, oh
Oh, up in heah! (Up in heah!) Up in heah... (Up in heah!)

It's cold on this path of evil - the dew falls heavy and hard
While I wait at bars and grills, commercial love, commercial thrill
But I remember the righteous living, and doing all I knew for good
If I could change this corruption, you know I would if I only could
But now, now, I'm the daughter of evil, and I'm trying to get you up in heah, up in heah
Oh, up in heah... (Up in heah...)
Up in heah! (Up in heah...) Oh, up in heah... (Up in heah...)
Up in heah! (Up in heah...) Oh, oh... (Up in heah...)
Up in heah, up in heah, oh, up in heah... (Up in heah...)
Woo, up in heah! (Up in heah...) Up in heah... (Up in heah...)
Oh! Oh, oh, oh...
