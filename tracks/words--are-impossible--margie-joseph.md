Words (Are Impossible)

Words without love are just words with no meaning
And the feeling that something has died
I can\'t hide with only words
Lose you, now the last thing I want is to lose you
But it seems like I\'m losin\' myself
I feel like someone else and not myself

Baby, words are impossible
When something\'s died
It\'s not the fame
Give me more (or \"that mean more\")
When I\'m by your side

Pretending, not part of
At heart of
Tell him once
Impossible
And it seems like I\'m losin\' myself
I feel like someone else
I\'m not myself


Baby, words are impossible
When something\'s died
It\'s not the fame
Give me more (or \"that mean more\")
When I\'m by your side

Easy, to pretend nothing\'s wrong
Would be easy
But to face it when something is wrong
It\'s the hardest thing I\'ve done
Stronger, I was weak but I\'m growing much stronger
If you give me a little more time
The more I find myself the more I found

Oooh, ooh, oh, words are impossible
When something\'s died
It\'s not the fame
Give me more (or \"that mean more\")
When I\'m by your side

Words without love have no meaning
I keep pretending
It gets harder
Sooooo, harder
Help me make it
Just a little more time, now
I\'ll get stronger
I\'ll get stronger :)
