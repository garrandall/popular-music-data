For a minute it was looking like 
I'd end up one of those guys
Spending my whole life
Looking for a special lady to save me
Maybe I'll never be satisfied 
Had a couple bad lucks and a couple dimes
Now that I'm looking for you
Why are you so hard to find?

I thought I took one step
I took two back
I'm not even close this time
And thats a fact
All I know is that we'd be the perfect match
So where you at love? 
I just gotta find you, yeah.

I wanna know, I wanna know
Your name, Your name, Your name
Why you gotta be anonymous?
I gotta know, I gotta know
Your name, Your name, Your name
Why you gotta be anonymous?
Baby I want you so much
Wanna hold, wanna feel your touch
Come fast girl I'm in a rush
Why you gotta be anonymous?
I wanna know, I gotta know
Your name, Your name, Your name
Why you gotta be anonymous?


What's your name?
Anonymous
Where you at?
Anonymous
When I think about you I get a rush
I wanna meet my Ms.Anonymous

 
Only see you when I close my eyes
We on borrowed time 
When I delayed the sunlight
Everything I tried to tell you I failed to
Maybe I'll tell you another time
How you keeping me so pre-occupied
Got a strong hold on me
Pay me no never mind

I thought I took one step
I took two back
I'm not even close this time
And thats a fact
All I know is that we'd be the perfect match
So where you at love? 
I just gotta find you, babe.

I wanna know, I wanna know
Your name, Your name, Your name
Why you gotta be anonymous?
I gotta know, I gotta know
Your name, Your name, Your name
Why you gotta be anonymous?
Baby I want you so much
Wanna hold, wanna feel your touch
Come fast girl I'm in a rush
Why you gotta be anonymous?
I wanna know, I gotta know
Your name, Your name, Your name
Why you gotta be anonymous?

What's your name?

Where you at?

When I think about you I get a rush

Girl you aint gotta lie
