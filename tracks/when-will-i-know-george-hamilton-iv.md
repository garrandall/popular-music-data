Ladedadeda, Ladedadeda
When will I know
Tell me how will it show
When will I know
I'm in love
Ladedadeda, Ladedadeda
How will I feel
When it happens for real
When will I know
I'm in love
Ladedadeda
When my true love is near
Should I hear
Angels like I do
My heart would like to know
Cause if it's so
The only one I want is you
When will I know
If you tell me it's so
When will I know
I'm in love
Ladedadeda
My heart would like to know
Cause if it's so
The only one I want is you
When will I know
If you tell me it's so
That's when I'll know
I'm in love
Ladedadeda, Ladedadeda
That's when I'll know I'm in love
