I want to tell all of you that ain't doin' nothin' for me
And can't do nothing for me
You should tend to your business and leave mine alone
Because as far as this man is concerned

I wanna tell ya he's mine (you've been a fool too long)
Now let me tell ya he's mine (wake up and he's gone)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (we know how you feel)
Yeah eh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah he's mine (but is it love for real)
I'm not ashamed (poor fool)
'Cause he's my man (says who?)
And he's mine (you've been a fool too long)

Now listen, this man is mine he's my every thought
I'd give him prussia if it could be bought
I'm not ashamed of nothing I do
I'd guide a missile if he told me to
'Cause he's mine (poor fool)
I know he's mine (says who?)
The man is mine (you been a fool too long)

And listen, if I make my bed hard
That's where I'm gonna sleep
You people talking means nothing to me
I work my fingers right down to the bone
Doin' the things to please him right or wrong
'Cause he's mine (poor fool)
I know he's mine (says who?)
The man is mine (You been a fool too long)
Oh he's a mine (you've been a fool too long)
And let me tell ya he's mine (wake up and he's gone)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (we know how you feel)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah he mine (but is it love for real?)
I'm not ashamed (poor fool)
'Cause he's my man (says who?)
And he's mine (you've been a fool too long)

And listen, I'm with my man in every way
Don't keep him hoppin' each and every day
I'll never hurt him or make him frown
I'm with my man if he's up or down
'Cause he's mine (poor fool)
I know he's mine (says who?)
The man is mine (you've been a fool too long)
And oh he's a mine (you've been a fool too long)
Now let me tell you he's mine (wake up and he's gone)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (we know how you feel)...
