Now that I know
What it is, boy
Good, good loving constantly
I wouldn't trade you
For nothing, baby
Oh, a joy you are to me

Cause you brought the
Kind of love I need
I once was blind
But now I see

You made a believer
Out of me, boy
You made a believer
Out of me
You made a believer
Out of me, boy
You made a believer
Out of me

Darling, all of my
Days are filled with love
Ever inside of me
I'm with you, baby
The walk that I walk
Is heavenly, oh, yeah

Cause you brought the
Kind of love I need
I once was blind
But now I see
Now I see

You made a believer
Out of me, boy
You made a believer
Out of me
You made a believer
Out of me, boy
You made a believer
Out of me

Oh baby, oh, baby

Oh, now I see
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You made me glad
I'm living, boy
You make my life worthwhile
You turned away
My sadness, baby
Now I can finally smile
Oh, yeah, yeah

Cause you brought the
Kind of love I need
I once was blind
But now I see
Now I see

You made a believer
Out of me, boy
You made a believer
Out of me
You made a believer
A true, true believer
You made a believer
Oh, you made a believer

Baby, oh
A believer...
