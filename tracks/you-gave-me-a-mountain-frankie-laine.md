Born in the heat of the desert
My mother died givin' me life
Deprived of the love of a father
Blamed for the loss of his wife

You know, Lord, I've been in a prison
For something that I've never done
It's been one hill after another
But I've climbed them all, one by one

But this time, Lord, you gave me a mountain
A mountain I may never climb
And is isn't a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time

My woman tired of the hardships
Tired of the grief and the strife
So tired of workin' for nothin'
Tired of bein' my wife

She took my one ray of sunshine
She took my pride and my joy
She took my reason for livin'
She took my small baby boy

So this time, Lord, you gave me a mountain
A mountain I may never climb
And is isn't a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time
