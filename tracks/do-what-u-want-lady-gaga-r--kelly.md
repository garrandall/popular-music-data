Yeah
Turn the mic up

I feel good, I walk alone
But then I trip over myself and I fall
I, I stand up, and then I'm okay
But then you print some shit
That makes me wanna scream

So do what you want
What you want with my body
Do what you want
Don't stop, let's party
Do what you want
What you want with my body
Do what you want
What you want with my body

Write what you want
Say what you want 'bout me
If youâre wondering
Know that I'm not sorry

Do what you want
What you want with my body
What you want with my body

You can't have my heart
And you won't use my mind but
Do what you want (with my body)
Do what you want with my body
You can't stop my voice cause
You don't own my life but
Do what you want (with my body)
Do what you want (with my body)

Early morning, longer nights
Tom Ford, private flights
Crazy schedule, fast life
I wouldn't trade it in
'Cause it's our life (let's slow it down...)

I could be the drink in your cup
I could be the green in your blunt
Your pusher man, yeah, I got what you want
You wanna escape all of the crazy shit
You're the Marilyn, I'm the president
And I'd love to hear you say, girl

Do what I want
Do what I want with your body
Do what I want
Do what I want with your body
Back of the club, taking shots, getting naughty
No invitations, it's a private party
Do what I want
Do what I want with your body
Do what I want
Do what I want with your body
Yeah, we taking these haters and we roughing 'em up
And we laying the club like we don't give a fuck

You can't have my heart
And you won't use my mind but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can't stop my voice cause
You don't own my life but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

Sometimes I'm scared I suppose
If you ever let me go
I would fall apart
If you break my heart
So just take my body
And don't stop the party

You canât have my heart (help me now)
And you won't use my mind but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can't stop my voice cause
You don't own my life but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

Do what you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body (world)
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body

World, help me now
What you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
What you want with my body
