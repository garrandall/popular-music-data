I feel you, your sun it shines
I feel you within my mind
You take me there, you take me where the kingdom comes
You take me to and lead me through Babylon


This is the morning of our love
It's just the dawning of our love


I feel you, your heart it sings
I feel you, the joy it brings
Where heaven waits, those golden gates and back again
You take me to and lead me through oblivion


This is the morning of our love
It's just the dawning of our love


I feel you, your precious soul
And I am whole
I feel you, your rising sun
My kingdom comes




I feel you, each move you make
I feel you, each breath you take
Where angels sing and spread their wings, my love's on high
You take me home, to glory's throne, by and by


This is the morning of our love
It's just the dawning of our love
This is the morning of our love
It's just the dawning of our love
