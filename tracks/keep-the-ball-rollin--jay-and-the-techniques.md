Keep the ball rollin', Keep the ball rollin'
Girl, the name of the game is love
On your mark, get set, let the kissin' start
And just Keep the ball rollin' baby
Right into my heart

How can you ask me to try
And get by with just one little kiss
The kissin' you do
I need a second helping to
When you light the fire in my heart
And every part of me is burning for you

You got to put your lips closer to mine
Girl, you got to follow it thru
(You got to follow it thru,)
You got to follow it thru
(You got to follow it thru.)

Keep the ball rollin', Keep the ball rollin'
Girl, the name of the game is love
On your mark, get set, let the kissin' start
And just Keep the ball rollin' baby
Right into my heart

Half of a loaf isn't better than none when I'm starvin' for you
Don't hold me tight if every night we stop at two
If you want me there when you call
Then girl it's all or nothing next time you do

You got to put your lips closer to mine
Girl, you got to follow it thru
(You got to follow it thru,)
You got to follow it thru
(You got to follow it thru.)

Keep the ball rollin', Keep the ball rollin'
Girl, the name of the game is love
On your mark, get set, let the kissin' start
And just Keep the ball rollin' baby
