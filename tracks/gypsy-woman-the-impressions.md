From nowhere through a caravan
Around the campfire light
A lovely woman in motion with hair as dark as night
Her eyes were like that of a cat in the dark
That hypnotized me with love


She was a gypsy woman
She was a gypsy woman


She danced around and round
To a guitar melody
From the fire her face was all aglow
How she enchanted me
Oh, how I'd like to hold her near
And kiss and forever whisper in her ear


I love you, gypsy woman
I love you, gypsy woman


All through the caravan
She was dancing with all the men
Waiting for the rising sun
Everyone was having fun
I hate to see the lady go
Knowing she'll never know
That I love her, I love her


The gypsy woman
(She was a) Gypsy woman
(She was a) Gypsy woman
(She was a) Gypsy woman
(She was a) Gypsy woman
(She was a) Gypsy woman
