I dedicate this song to recession
Depression and unemployment
This song's for you


Today's a new day, but there is no sunshine
Nothing but clouds, and it's dark in my heart
And it feels like a cold night
Today's a new day, but where are my blue skies
Where is the love and the joy that you promised me?
Tell me it's alright
(I'll be honest with you)
I almost gave up, but a power that I can't explain
Fell from heaven like a shower
(When I think how much better I'm gonna be when this is over)


I smile, even though I'm hurt, see I smile
I know God is working so I smile
Even though I've been here for a while
I smile
Smile
It's so hard to look up when you've been down
Sure would hate to see you give up now
You look so much better when you smile, so smile

(Now every day ain't gon' be perfect
But it still don't mean today don't have purpose
Come on)


Today's a new day, but there is no sunshine
Nothing but clouds, and it's dark in my heart
And it feels like a cold night
Today's a new day, tell me where are my blue skies
Where is the love and the joy that you promised me?
Tell me it's alright
(The truth is)
I almost gave up, but a power that I can't explain
Fell from heaven like a shower


I smile
Even though I'm hurt, see, I smile
I know God is working so I smile
Even though I've been here for a while
I smile
Smile
It's so hard to look up when you've been down
Sure would hate to see you give up now
You look so much better when you smile


Smile.. for me
Can you just smile... for me
Smile.. for me
Can you just smile... for me

Oh, oh, oh (you look so much better when you)
Oh, oh, oh (you look so much better when you)
Oh, oh, oh (you look so much better when you)
Oh, oh, oh (you look so much better when you)
Oh, oh, oh (you look so much better when you)
(And while you're waiting)
Oh, oh, oh (you look so much better when you)
(And while you're praying)
Oh, oh, oh (you look so much better when you)
(Look in the mirror)
Oh, oh, oh (you look so much better when you)
(Always remember)
You look so much better when you smile

I almost gave up, but a power that I can't explain
Fell from heaven like a shower


I smile
Even though I'm hurt, see, I smile
I know God is working so I smile
Even though I've been here for a while
I smile
Smile
It's so hard to look up when you've been down
Sure would hate to see you give up now
You look so much better when you smile

Oh, oh, oh (you look so much better when you)
Oh, oh, oh (you look so much better when you)
Oh, oh, oh (you look so much better when you)
Oh, oh, oh (you look so much better when you)
Oh, oh, oh (you look so much better when you)
Oh, oh, oh (you look so much better when you)
Oh, oh, oh (you look so much better when you)
Oh, oh, oh (you look so much better when you)
Smile...

I don’t want you you to just be happy
Because then you have to have something happening
I want you to have joy
Because can’t nobody take that from you
I see you.. SMILE!!
