And now, the end is near
Lord, you know, I got to
Face the final curtain

My friends
I'll say it real clear
Let me state my case
Of which I'm certain

I've lived, I've lived
A life that's full
I've traveled each
And every highway

More than this, man
I wanna talk about just a
Little bit more than this
I did it my, my, my, my
My, my, my, my, my, my way

Regrets, well
I've had me a few
But then again
Too doggone few to mention

I did what I had to do
And I saw it through
Without exemption

And took my time and
Planned each charted course
Each careful step
Along the byway

And more than this
More than this, more
Than this, more than this
More than this, more than this
I did it my, my, my, my
My, my, my, my, my, my way

Yes, there were times
I'm sure you knew
When I kinda bit off
A little but more
Than I could chew

But by the help of God
When there was doubt
People, I ate it up
Yes, and I spit it out

I faced it all
And I stood tall
And did it my way, my way
My, my, my, my way

I've loved, yes, I have
I've laughed and cried
God knows I've had my fill
My share of losing

And now, now, now
As tears subside
I find it all so amusing

Now just to think
I did all that
And may I say
Not in a shy way

Woah, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, not me
Man, I had to do it my way
My way

What is a man
Tell me what has he got
If not himself
Then, people, he has not

He's gotta say the things
He truly feels
And not the words
Of one who kneels

My record shows
I had to take a few blows
But I did it my way
