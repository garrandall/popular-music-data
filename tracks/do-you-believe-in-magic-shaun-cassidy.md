Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart
How the music can free her whenever it starts
And it's magi-ic, if the music is groovy
It makes you feel lovely like an old-time movie
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
But it's like tryin' to tell a stranger 'bout rock and ro-o-oll

If you believe in magic don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen it'll start with a smile
It won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start a-tappin' and you can't seem to find
How you got there, so just blow your mind

If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until mornin', 'til there's just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we'll go dancin', baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me

Yeah - do you believe in magic
Yeah - believe in the magic of a young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of rock and roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free-ee
Woh-oh, talkin' 'bout magic
Do you believe in magic
Do you believe in me-ee
Do you believe in ma-a-a-agic
Believe in me
Do you believe in ma-a-agic
Do you believe in me-ee
Do you believe in ma-a-agic
