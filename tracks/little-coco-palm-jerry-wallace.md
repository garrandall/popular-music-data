Little coco palm
Growing in the island sun
Little coco palm
Do you know what
You have done

From your coconut
Comes the meat
To make us stuck
And your milk is sweet
So we drink and eat
All the day long

Little coco palm
When we use your coconut
Then we take your leaves
And we build a little hut

Make a hula skirt for
The one I'm dreaming of
Little coco palm, little coco palm
Tree that we love

Little coco palm
Waving in the island breeze
Do you ever think of
The many hearts you please

Mama, to live out?
May you always wave about
Little coco palm, little coco palm
Tree that we love

Little coco palm, little coco palm
Tree that we love
