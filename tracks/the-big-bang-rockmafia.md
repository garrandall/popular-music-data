(Oh, babe)
I don't wanna lie
I'm gonna take what you're giving
Cause I know you're willing
To take me all the way
You got me right here
Combustible
And I can't wait to finally explode

The big big bang
The reason I'm alive
When all the stars collide
In this universe inside
The big big bang
The big big bang
The big big bang

Some people like to talk
But I'm into doing
What I feel like doing when I'm inspired
So, if we take a walk down the beach tonight
I bet that we could light up the sky

The big big bang
The reason I'm alive
When all the stars collide
In this universe inside
The big big bang
The big big bang
The big big bang

(Take it from me)
I don't wanna be mummified
Sometimes I feel so isolated
I wanna die
And now take it from me
If you got it every time, so baby
Bring your body here
Next to mine
Next to mine

Well, I don't wanna dream
I just wanna live
So baby, let's not miss this thing

The big big bang
The reason I'm alive
When all the stars collide
In this universe inside
The big big bang
The big big bang
The big big bang

Hit me, big big big bang
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
