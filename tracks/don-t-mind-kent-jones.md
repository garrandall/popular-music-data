Hola, holana


Keep telling me this and telling me that
You said once you take me with you, I’ll never go back
Now I got a lesson, that I want to teach
I'ma show you that where you from don’t matter to me


She said "Hola, ¿Cómo estás?", she said "Konnichiwa"
She said "Pardon my French", I said "Bonjour Madame"
Then she said "Sak pase" and I said "N'ap boule"
No matter where I go, you know I love 'em all
She said "Hola, ¿Cómo estás?", she said "Konnichiwa"
She said "Pardon my French", I said "Bonjour Madame"
Then she said "Sak pase" and I said "N'ap boule"
No matter where I go, you know I love 'em all


African American for sho
I told her, "Baby come and ride the rodeo"
Every time I come around man, I go for broke
She gives me desktop til' I overload
Now baby you gon' go where you pos to go
'Cause I ain't got time for you every day
She said she got a man keep it on the low
I said he don’t speak English, fuck he gon' say (aye)


Telling me this and telling me that
You said once you take me with you, I’ll never go back
Now I got a lesson that I want to teach ya

She said "Pardon my French", I said "Bonjour Madame"
Then she said "Sak pase" and I said "N'ap boule"

She said "Hola, ¿Cómo estás?, she said "Konnichiwa"
She said "Pardon my French", I said "Bonjour Madame"
Then she said "Sak pase" and I said "N'ap boule"
No matter where I go, you know I love 'em all


She from Africa but she fuck me like she Haitian
Ass black, but the eyes looking Asian
I give her the can in Kansas
I got it on tape, she on Candid Camera
Okay see, I forgot we met in Oklahoma
I use to smoke Regina, she from Arizona
Then I met a girl in Cali I never disowned her
She got that high grade, her weed come with diplomas
I want her but she keep


Telling me this and telling me that

Now I got a lesson that I want to teach ya
