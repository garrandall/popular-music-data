I remember, when i was small
I saw the preacher man (ahh!) he was walking tall
I remember his words and what he had to say

Alive in my mind... like it was yesterday

He said: just hold your head up high
And walk in the sky
And if they ask you "why?" say

I am, somebody! say it!
I am, somebody! say it!
I am, somebody! yeah!

(Brass section)

Don't be ashamed for what you are
Wear your life wit pride
Don't let it be a scar

The weak and the strong
The big and the small

They have a right to be here
They do belong

Just hold your head up high
And walk in the sky
And if they ask you "why?" say

I am, somebody! say it!
I am, somebody! say it!
I am, somebody!

(Brass section)

Stand up, and be yourself
Stand up brother... and speak for yourself

In the eyes of the lord, we're all one
What's good enough for god
You dig... right on!

Just hold your head up high
And walk in the sky
And if they ask you "why?" say

I am, somebody! say it!
I am, somebody! tell it!
I am, somebody! say it

(Trumpet solo)

I am, somebody! say it!
I am, somebody! say it sister!
I am, somebody! what you sayin' over there brother?
I am, somebody! let me her you're say it ah!
I am, somebody! tell me
I am, somebody! say it
I am, somebody! say it
I am, somebody! now you getting to it
I am, somebody! yeah
I am, somebody!
I am, somebody! yeah
I am, somebody! yeah, all together

(Fading out...)
