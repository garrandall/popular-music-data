Mrs. Brown, you've got a lovely daughter
Girls as sharp as her are something rare
But it's sad, she doesn't love me now
She's made it clear enough, it ain't no good to pine

She wants to return those things I bought her
Tell her she can keep them just the same
Things have changed, she doesn't love me now
She's made it clear enough, it ain't no good to pine


Walkin' about
Even in a crowd, well
You'll pick her out
Makes a bloke feel so proud


If she finds that I've been 'round to see you ('round to see you)
Tell her that I'm well and feelin' fine (feelin' fine, ooh)
Don't let on, don't say she's broke my heart
I'd go down on my knees but it's no good to pine


Walkin' about
Even in a crowd, well
You'll pick her out
Makes a bloke feel so proud

Tell her that I'm well and feeling fine (feelin' fine, ooh)
Don't let on, don't say she's broke my heart
I'd go down on my knees but it's no good to pine


Mrs. Brown, you've got a lovely daughter (lovely daughter)
Mrs. Brown, you've got a lovely daughter (lovely daughter)
Mrs. Brown, you've got a lovely daughter (lovely daughter)
Mrs. Brown, you've got a lovely daughter (lovely daughter)
