Tell me your secret
I don't just want to know
About any secret of yours
I wanna know about
One special secret (oh)

Because tonight I want you
To learn all about the
Secrets in your garden

I wanna read your mind
Know your deepest feelings
I wanna make it right for you
Baby, show me, let me
Share the mystery, oh

Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Listen to your heart tonight

Come on, come on
Come on, make it alright, yeah
Come on, come on tonight

I know a melody
We can sing together
I've got the secret key
To you, baby
Let's make music
Harmonize in ectasy

Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on and sing it to me

Here in the garden where
Temptations feel so right
Passion can make you fall
From what you feel

In the garden (hoooo)
We can make it come alive
(We can make it come alive)
Every night (every single night)
Oh, your secret garden (hooo)

Oh, baby
I need to be with you
Let me lay beside you
Do what you want me to
All night

Wanna hold you, oh baby
Can I touch you there

Come on, come on
Come on, come on
I can keep you satisfied, baby

Come on, come on, come on
Oowee, oowee, baby
Please, baby, oh, darling
Come on, come on tonight

I'll take good care of you
That's what a man is
Supposed to do
And I'll be there for you
All the time

Let your hair down
Let me get you in the mood

Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Take me, take me with you
Log on to Top40db.

Into the garden where
Temptation feel so right
Passion can make you fall
From what you feel

In the garden, we can
Make it come alive
Every night
Oh, woman
Here in the garden

You know I never
Wanted anyone
I never wanted anyone
As much as I
As much as I want you

I want you to show me
I want you to tell me
I want to feel all the secrets

If you think I am
Gonna take care of you
If you think I have
Got what you need
Show you right

And I want to take our time
Because we have all night

If you think I am
Gonna be good to you
If you think I
Like what you do
Show you right

Oh, gonna be so
Good to you, baby
Oowee, owee, baby

If you think I am
Gonna take care of you
If you think I have
Got what you need
Show you right

Let me find your secrets

If you think I am
Gonna be good to you
If you think I
Like what you do
Show you right

Show you right
Baby, you know

If you think I am
Gonna take care of you
If you think I have
Got what you need
Show you right

How does that feel

If you think I am
Gonna be good to you
If you think I
Like what you do
Show you right

Oh, show you right

If you think I am
Gonna take care of you
If you think I have
Got what you need
Show you right
