I said I'm tired and I must complain
I said I'm sick and tired
I'm tired of feeling the same
Well, I've been searching
Been looking so long
Forgot what the hell what I was looking for


I'm uptight, nothing right
Can't sleep, can't eat
All night and day I cry
For somebody by my side
I'd give my heart and soul
I'd give me
If someone would give me
What'd I say? What'd I say?


What I need, I need
What I need, I need
I need something to come over me
Lift me up and set me free
Someone who can give
What I need, I need
What I need, yeah


I said I'm longing
And I want relief
I said I'm aching and longing
For someone to believe in
But I been talking
Been talking so long
I forgot what the hell what I was talking 'bout


I'm uptight, nothing right
Can't eat, can't sleep
All night and day I cry
For somebody by my side
I'd give my heart and soul
I'd give me
If someone would give me
What'd I say, what'd I say


What I need, I need
What I need, I need
I need something to come over me
Lift me up and set me free
Someone who will give
What I need, I need
What I need, I need

I need
I need something to come over me
Lift me up and set me free
Someone who will give
What I need, I need, I need, I need




I said I'm uptight, nothing right
Can't eat, can't sleep
All night and day I cry
For somebody by my side
I'd give my heart and soul
I'd give me
If someone would give me
What I'd say, what I'd say?

I need, what I need
I need, I need
What I need, I need
I need, I need
What I need, I need
I need, I need
What I need, I need
I need, I need
What I need, I need
