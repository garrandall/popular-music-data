Gonna tell you a story about a little town I know
They had a real big problem
With some big mean local ghost
Those spooks were making the whole city lose control
Well the mayor was frantic, the town was panicked
'Cause they had no sense of fear
'Cause they knew that they were missing those boys with a mission
So they called them up I cheer
They went boxing and trapping and shooting through the joint
Stepped right in and got down to the point
Those Ghostbusters came in cleanin' up the town, oh yeah
About five o'clock those boys came up
And they could see those spooks were real
And they knew they'd better get right to work
So they revved up the Ectomobile
Yeah, the boys were ready, their aim was steady
And their hearts were made of steel
Well the mayor he started ranting around
And the whole town started to roar
And they're seeing this town that rocked
Those Slimers dropped down to the floor
They went boxing and trapping and shooting through the joint
Stepped right in and got down to the point
Those Ghostbusters came in cleanin' up the town
They went boxing and trapping and shooting through the joint
Stepped right in and got down to the point
You should seen those specters in the trap saying
"Those boys make 'em dance"
Well New York, New York's so happy now
They rocked that building, boy
But if the boys hadn't come to the rescue
The spooks might have still been making noise
They went boxing and trapping and shooting through the joint
Stepped right in and got down to the point
Those Ghostbusters came in cleanin' up the town
