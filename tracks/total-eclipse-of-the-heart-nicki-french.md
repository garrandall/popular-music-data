Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely and you're never coming around
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
Cause we'll never be wrong together

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart

Turn around
Every now and then I know you'll never be the boy you always you wanted to be
Turn around
Every now and then I know you'll always be the only boy who wanted me the way that I am
Turn around
Every now and then I know there's no one in the universe as magical and wonderous as you
Turn around
Every now and then I know there's nothing any better; there's nothing that I just wouldn't do
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
Cause we'll never be wrong together
We can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart
Once upon a time there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart

But now there's only love in the dark
Now there's only love in the dark
Now there's only love in the dark
Now there's only love in the dark
A total eclipse of the heart
Now there's only love in the dark
Now there's only love in the dark
Now there's only love in the dark

A total eclipse of the heart

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart
