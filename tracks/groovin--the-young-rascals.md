Groovin' on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon


I can't imagine anything that's better
The world is ours whenever we're together
There ain't a place I'd like to be instead of


Movin' down a crowded avenue
Doin' anything we like to do


There's always lots of things that we can see
We can be anyone we like to be
And all those happy people we could meet just


Groovin' on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon
No, no, no, no




We'll keep on spending sunny days this way
We're gonna talk and laugh our time away
I feel it coming closer day by day
Life would be ecstasy, you and me endlessly


Groovin' on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away to soon
No, no, no, no


Groovin' (uh huh, uh huh)
Groovin'
