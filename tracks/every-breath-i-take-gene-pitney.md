(dip-dip, dooba bop bop) (dip-dip, dooba bop bop)

I hardly ever thank the stars above
For sending me your very precious love
You never hear me say a prayer
Of thanks to someone 'way up there
Who gave me such a lucky *break*

Oh, no, darling
Only with ev'ry breath I take

And every time we have to be apart
I hardly ever find you in my heart
And when it comes to thinking of
The thought of losing all your love
I never worry how my heart would ache

Oh, no, darling
Only with ev'ry breath I *take*
Only with ev'ry little step I *make*
Only with ev'ry little beat of my *heart*
And ev'ry single minute I'm *awake*

Oh, no, darling
Only with ev'ry breath I *take*
Only with ev'ry little step I *make*
Only with ev'ry little beat of my *heart*
And ev'ry single minute I'm awake

Oh-aah, ev'ry little breath I take
Ev'ry little step I *make*
Ah, ah, ah, ah, uh, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ev'ry breath I take

(dip-dip, dooba bop bop) (dip-dip, dooba bop bop)...
