There's a rumor here
And it's going round
Can you hear it on the street
If you realize that the pleasure lies
Between surrender and the heat

Just take a walk
on the wild side babe
And I'll meet you halfway there
And if you're talking about paradise
There's no need to say a prayer
Cause baby I'll take you there

Hey girl
Haven't you heard
Heaven is a four letter word
One touch is never enough
You'll find out when you enter the world
Heaven is a four letter word

Lose your innocence
For experience
But you've got to take the chance
Can you rock and roll
Can you get down babe
Cause it's tough for you to dance

Don't need to ride in a limousine
To feel like a millionaire
And if you're talking 'bout fantasy
It could happen anywhere
Baby I'll take you there

Hey girl
Haven't you heard
Heaven is a four letter word
One touch is never enough
You'll find out when you enter the world
Heaven is a four letter word

It's like love and kiss
And it feels like this
Baby don't wait too long
It's just me and you
We know what to do
And it's a long way til dawn

Yeah

Hey girl
Haven't you heard
Heaven is a four letter word
One touch is never enough
You'll find out when you enter the world
Heaven is a four letter word

Hey girl
Haven't you heard
Heaven is a four letter word
One touch is never enough
You'll find out when you enter the world
Heaven is a four letter word

(Hey girl)
Oh yeah
(Heaven is a four letter word)
It's a four letter word
(One touch)
Haven't you heard
(Heaven is a four letter word)

Hey
Hey girl
Haven't you heard
Heaven is a four letter word
