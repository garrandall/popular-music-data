Don't you know
They're talkin' bout a revolution
It sounds like a whisper
Don't you know
They're talkin' bout a revolution
It sounds like a whisper

While they're standing in the welfare lines
Crying at the doorsteps of those armies of salvation
Wasting time in the unemployment lines
Sitting around waiting for a promotion

Don't you know
They're talkin' bout a revolution
It sounds like a whisper

Poor people gonna rise up
And get their share
Poor people gonna rise up
And take what's theirs

Don't you know you better run, run, run,
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,
Run
Oh I said you better run, run, run, run,
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run

Just finally the tables are starting to turn
Talkin' bout a revolution
Just finally the tables are starting to turn
Talkin' bout a revolution, oh no
Talkin' bout a revolution

I've been standing in the welfare lines
Crying at the doorsteps of those armies of salvation
Wasting time in the unemployment lines
Sitting around waiting for a promotion

Don't you know
They're talkin' bout a revolution
It sounds like a whisper

And finally the tables are starting to turn
Talkin' bout a revolution
Just finally the tables are starting to turn
Talkin' bout a revolution, oh no
Talkin' bout a revolution, oh no
Talkin' bout a revolution, oh no
