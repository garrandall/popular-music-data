For awhile to love was all we could do
We were young and we knew
And our eyes were alive
Deep inside we knew our love was true
For awhile we paid no mind to the past
We knew love would last
Ev'ry night somethin' right
Would invite us to begin the dance

Somethin' happened along the way
What used to be happy was sad
Somethin' happened along the way
And yesterday was all we had
And oh after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around
Oh oh oh after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found

For awhile to love each other with all
We would ever need
Love was strong for so long
Never knew that what was
Wrong oh baby wasn't right
We tried to find what we had
Till sadness was all we shared
We were scared this affair would lead our love into
Somethin' happened along the way
Yesterday was all we had
Somethin' happened along the way
What used to be happy is sad

Somethin' happened along the way
Oh yesterday was all we had
And oh after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around
Oh oh oh after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found

Oh oh oh oh oh oh after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found
Oh woh woh after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found

Woh woh who
