Deeper and deeper
I'm falling in love with you
My life grows sweeter every day

There must be something
In the things you do
That makes me love you
In a helpless way

You`re my joy
My all and all
A fountain of love
That keeps me falling

Deeper and deeper
In love with you
Each day gets sweeter and
Sweeter just being with you
I'm so in love with you

Stronger and stronger
My heart beats for you
You give me a feeling
I can't explain

And every day you prove
Your love is true
You give me comfort
Like no others can

You're my dream
My one desire
You're the hope
That lifts me higher

Deeper and deeper
In love with you
Each day gets sweeter and
Sweeter just being with you

Each day gets sweeter
So much sweeter
Just being with you
I'm falling deeper and deeper
In love with you
