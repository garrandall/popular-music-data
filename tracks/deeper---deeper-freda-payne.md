Try, try to break you down at least a thousand times
There's an emptiness inside me when you're far away
That I can't erase and I go insane 'til I see your face
And I shout, 'cause the silence when you're gone is way too loud

Got to get my head together 'cause I'm not okay
I'm just not the same, I'm just tryin' make it
You're my everything

And I, can't stop my heart from racing
I need you here by my side
I feel the walls closing in
Baby you're saving a life

One kiss at a time
I can't live without you
And I don't wanna try
You're saving a life

'Cause you're the air that I breathe
There ain't no world without you
I'm hanging on by a thread
Maybe you're saving a life

One kiss at time
I can't live without you
And I don't wanna try
You're saving a life

You're the one that picks me up when I'm down
When the trials and tribulations of life get hard
Deep inside my heart, I let down my guard
You're the light in the dark

So stay, you're the reason why I make it through the day
There's a storm raging inside me when you're far away
That I can't escape, and I go insane, 'til I see your face

And I, can't stop my heart from racing
I need you here by my side
I feel the walls closing in
Baby you're saving a life

One kiss at a time
I can't live without you
And I don't wanna try
You're saving a life

'Cause you're the air that I breathe
There ain't no world without you
I'm hanging on by a thread
Baby you're saving a life

One kiss at time
I can't live without you
And I don't wanna try
You're saving a life

Staring into you like a dream, lean into me
I'm not giving up
I'm never giving up
Because you're saving a life
I need you tonight

Baby you're saving a life
One kiss at a time
I can't live without you
And I don't wanna try
You're saving a life

One kiss at a time
I can't live without you
And I don't wanna try
You're saving a life

'Cause you're the air that I breathe
There ain't no world without you
I'm hanging on by a thread
Baby you're saving a life

Can't stop my heart from racing
I need you here by my side
I feel the walls closing in
Baby you're saving a life

'Cause you're the air that I breathe
There ain't no world without you
I'm hanging on by a thread
Baby you're saving a life
