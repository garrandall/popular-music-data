One life, one love
Enrique Iglesias, Pitbull
Ya'll know what time it is.
We gon' set it off tonight, just go
Set the club on fire, just go
Enrique! Holla at them like


Girl please excuse me if I'm coming too strong
But tonight is the night we can really let it go
My girlfriend's out of town and I'm all alone
Your boyfriend's on vacation and he doesn't have to know

No oh oh, oh oh
No one can do the things I'm gonna wanna do to you
No oh oh, oh oh
Shout aloud, scream aloud
Let me hear you go!


Baby I like it
The way you move on the floor
Baby I like it
Come on and give me some more
Oh yes I like it
Screaming like never before
Baby I like it
I, I, I like it.


Party, karamu, fiesta, forever


Girl please excuse me if I'm misbehaving, oh
I'm tryna keep my hands off but you're begging me for more
Round round round give a low low low
Let the time time pass 'cause we're never getting old

No oh oh, oh oh
No one can do it better turn around I'll give you more
No oh oh, oh oh
Shout aloud, scream aloud
Let me hear you go!


Baby I like it
The way you move on the floor
Baby I like it
Come on and give me some more
Oh yes I like it
Screaming like never before
Baby I like it
I, I, I like it.


Go DJ. That's my DJ.
I'm a Miami boy. You know how we play
I ain't playing with you but I wanna play with you
Give me got me good.
Now watch me.

It's a different species,
Get me in DC
Let's party on the White House lawn
Tiger Woods plus Jesse James equals Pitbull all night long
Wake up Barack and Michelle, let 'em know that it's on

Pa' fuera! Pa' la calle!
Dale mamita tirame ese baile!
Dale mamita tirame ese baile!

I see you watching me,
You see me watchin' you
I love the way you move
I like them things you do like.


Don't stop baby, don't stop baby
Just keep on shaking along
I won't stop baby, won't stop baby
Until you get enough


Party, karamu, fiesta, forever


Baby I like it!
The way you move on the floor
Baby I like it!
Come on and give me some more!
Oh yes I like it!
Screaming like never before
Baby I like it!
I, I, I like it!

Baby I like it!
The way you move on the floor
Baby I like it!
Come on and give me some more!
Oh yes I like it!
Screaming like never before
Baby I like it!
I, I, I like it!

Party (oh yes I like it!) karamu, fiesta, forever!
Oh yes I like it!
Party, karamu (oh yes I like it!) fiesta, forever!
