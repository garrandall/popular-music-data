Can you see me?
'Cause I'm right here
Can you listen?
'Cause I've been trying to make you notice
What it would mean to me
To feel like somebody
We've been on our way to nowhere
Trying so hard to get there


And I say, oh
We're gonna let it show
We're gonna just let go of everything
Holding back our dreams
And try
To make it come alive
Come on, let it shine so they can see
We were meant to be
Somebody
Somebody, yeah
Somehow, someday
Someway, somebody


I'm so tired
Of being invisible
But I feel it, yeah
Like a fire below the surface
Trying to set me free
Burning inside of me
'Cause we're standing on the edge now
It's a long way down


But I say, oh
We're gonna let it show
We're gonna just let go of everything
Holding back our dreams
And try
To make it come alive
Come on, let it shine so they can see
We were meant to be
Somebody
Somebody, yeah
Somehow, someday
Someway, somebody


We will walk out of this darkness
Feel the spotlight glowing
Like a yellow sun
Oh-oh-oh
And when we fall
We fall together
'Til we get back up
And we will rise as one
Oh-oh-oh


Oh
We're gonna let it show
We're gonna just let go of everything
Holding back our dreams
And try
To make it come alive
Come on, let it shine so they can see
We were meant to be
Somebody
Somebody, yeah
Somehow, someday
Someway, somebody


Somebody
Oh, oh, oh
