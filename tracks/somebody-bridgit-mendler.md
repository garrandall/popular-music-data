When somebody loved me,
Everything was beautiful
Every hour spent together
Lives within my heart

And when she was sad,
I was there to dry her tears
And when she was happy,
So was I

When she loved me

Through the summer
And the fall,
We had each other,
That was all
Just she and I together,
Like it was meant to be

And when she was lonely,
I was there to comfort her
And I knew that she loved me

So the years went by,
I stayed the same
She began to drift away,
I was left alone

Still, I waited for the day
When she'd say,
"I will always love you."

Lonely and forgotten,
Never thought she'd look my way
She smiled at me and held me
Just like she used to do

When somebody loved me,
Everything was beautiful
Every hour spent together
Lives within my heart

When she loved me
Like she loved me

When she loved me
When she loved me

La da da,
La, la, la
La, oh
