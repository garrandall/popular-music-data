Life is taking turns, falling flat on your chin
Trying to fly with the birds
Love sure is blind
âcause it donât see
It ainât spent one night feelinâ sorry for me
There ainât too many times I felt like a king
Sitting here with your dear makes me wanna sing
Today the sun is shininâ on me
Sitting with my feet in the breeze
Ainât sweating the little things
And who knows what tomorrow is gonna bring
But today, the sun, shininâ on me
Lady love, forgets me every time
Iâm spending my days packinâ nickels and dimes
But the man in the moon, yeah heâs alright
He must've flipped on the switch when he left last night
âcause Iâm feelingâ alright, feelinâ alright
Today the sun is shininâ on me
Sitting with my feet in the breeze
Ainât sweating the little things
And who knows what tomorrow is gonna bring
But today, the sun, shininâ on me
There ainât too many times I felt like a king
Sitting here with you dear makes me wanna sing
Today the sun is shininâ on me
Sitting with my feet in the breeze
Ainât sweating the little things
And who knows what tomorrow is gonna bring
But today, the sun is shininâ on me
Sitting with my feet in the breeze
Ainât sweating the little things
And who knows what tomorrow is gonna bring
But today, the sun is shininâ on, shining on, shining on me
