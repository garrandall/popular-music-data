There are games
That many foolish lovers play
Blindly chasing happy endings
Come what may
Never caring who gets hurt along the way

Let's not play those games
That lovers play

Sometimes lovers hurt each other
Telling lies
Acting out charades
Behind their smiling eyes

If you love me, darling
You must realize
We can't play those games
That lovers play

When I whisper
I'll be yours eternally
In my heart
I feel our love is meant to be

It's not just to have you share
One dream with me
I'm not playing games
That lovers play

I want so to let my heart
Believe in you
Let your kisses bring me thrills
I never knew
But I must be sure
You feel the way I do

Let's not play those games
That lovers play
