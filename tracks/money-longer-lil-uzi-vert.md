Yeah, it do not matter
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster


Money so old, dollars spoiled (Spoiled)
Yeah, my lil' bitch so spoiled (Spoiled)
Yeah, I rub her down in oil
Yeah, I got money, now you know it
Yeah, diamonds on my teeth
Yeah, your shit look like foil
Yeah, Chris Brown said these hoes ain't loyal
None of these hoes got no morals (No)

Never thought that she would need me that much if I leave her


It do not matter

All of this was faction
No time for actin', all this money lastin'
Like, go out to eat, get that blackened salmon
When I'm wit' my girl, we Pharrell and Vashtie
Wait, huh? That mean we are not lastin'
In that pussy, you know I like it rough, then I'm just blastin'
Yeah, tell that lil' bitch that I'm really from Mars
Uh, yeah, bitch, do not start
Yeah, pull up, my car automatic
Yeah, uh, dealt with the star, yeah!
