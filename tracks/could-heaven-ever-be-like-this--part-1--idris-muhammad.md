I feel music in your eyes
Rainbows in your kiss
I have never reached such heights
Could heaven ever be like this?

I see a love song in your touch
A miracle exists
The sweet sensation's all too much
Could heaven ever be like this

I feel music in your eyes
Rainbows in your kiss
I have never reached such heights
Will heaven ever be like this?

I see a love song in your touch
A miracle exists
The sweet sensation's all too much
Could heaven ever be like this
