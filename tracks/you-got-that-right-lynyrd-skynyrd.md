Well I've heard lots of people say
They're going to settle down
You don't see their faces
And they don't come around
Well I'm not that way
I got to move along
I like to drink and to dance all night
Comes to a fix not afraid to fight


You got that right
Said, you got that right
Sure got that right


Seems so long I been out on my own
Travel light and I'm always alone
Guess I was born with a travellin' bone
When my times up, I'll hold my own
You won't find me in an old folks home


You got that right
Said you got that right
Well, you got that right
Sure got that right


I tried everything in my life
Things I like I try 'em twice




Travelling around the world, just singing my song
I got to go, Lord I can't stay long
Here comes that ol' travelling jones once again
I like to drink and to dance all night
Comes to a fix not afraid to fight
