You ain't nothin' but a sweet thing, yeah
And I'll come back for more every day

Feels so, so good to me (I'm in the mood)
Makes me feel oh, so right
I'm in the mood, ahaha, boy
I want you forever
I'm in the mood

Let's start tonight out right
You and I bathed in candlelight
Tasting the wine on your lips
Touching your body tenderly with my fingertips

I feel a sweet sensation rushing through my body
It needs no explaining, it's for your lovin'
Just dim the lights and ask me what I want, oh, baby
So I can say exactly how I feel

I'm in the mood and I hope you feel it too
Take me away and I'll come back for more every day
I'm in the mood and I hope you feel it too
Take me away and I'll come back for more every day

Ahaha, boy, I want you forever
I don't know if you know it or not
But I'm in the mood

Let's not spoil the moment, boy
Unplug the phone so we can be alone
There is something about your kiss
That makes me feel like nothing else exists

Let's get into the moment, we won't regret it
There's so much passion between us, we can't control it
This is a night that we soon won't forget, oh, baby
I've never been more ready for your love

I'm in the mood and I hope you feel it too
Take me away and I'll come back for more every day
I'm in the mood and I hope you feel it too
Take me away and I'll come back for more every day

You ain't nothin' but a sweet thing, yeah
And I'll come back for more every day
Ahaha, boy, I want you forever (Heyeyey)
Check this out

Ahaha, boy, I want you forever
Every day (Check this out)
I'm in the mood (You make me feel so good)
You make me feel, oh, so right

I'm in the mood (So, so good to me)
Makes me feel oh, so right (Makes me feel so good)

I don't know if you know it or not
But I'm in the mood

Ready for your love every day

And I'll come back for more every day

Ahaha, boy, I want you forever
Every day (Check this out)
I'm in the mood (So, so good to me)
Makes me feel oh, so right (Makes me feel so good)
