Ready or not here I come
Gee that used to be such fun
Apples peaches pumpkin pie
Who's afraid to holler I?
That's a game we used to play
Hide and seek was its name
Oh ready or not, hear I come
Gee that used to be such fun
I always used to find a hiding place
Times have changed
Well I'm one step behind you, but still I can't find you
Apple peaches pumpkin pie
You were young and so was I
Now that we've grown up it seems
You just keep ignoring me
I'll find you anywhere you go
I'll follow you high and low
You can't escape this love of mine anytime
Well, I'll sneak up behind you
Be careful where I find you
Apple peaches pumpkin pie
Soon your love will be all mine
Then I'm gonna take you home
Marry you so you won't roam
Marry you so you won't roam. Right now
I'll find you anywhere you go
I'm gonna look high and low
You can't escape this love of mine anytime
Well, I'll sneak up behind you
Be careful where I find you
Ready or not here I come
Gee that used to be such fun
(repeat and fade)
