Hello Baby
I betcha never thought I would call
Well my heart just went in with this dime
And I only get three minutes time
Hear me out now
I wanna to make it as clear as I can
There's so much that I want to explain
And the final decision remains
In you hands

Please remember what I told you to forget
There's a man on the phone
And he wants to come home
To the woman he loves all alone

Baby remember what I told you to forget
No I won't waste anytime when I hang up the line
I'll be back in your arms
Where I know I belong

One more minute
Let me pour my heart out to you
'Cause I've kept it all locked up inside
You just can't tell your own foolish pride what to do

So remember what I told you to forget
No I wouldn't waste anytime when I hang up the line
I'll be back in your arms
Where I know I belong

If it isn't already too late
Let me give you a reason to wait
For the life that I'm begging to live
Will depend on the answer you give

Please remember what I told you to forget
There's a man on the phone
And he wants to come home
To the woman he loves all alone

Baby remember what I told you to forget
No I won't waste anytime when I hang up the phone
I'll be back in your arms
I'll be back in your ar
