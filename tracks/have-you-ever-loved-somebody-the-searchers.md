You say that you want me and now that you've got me you're gone
So think what you're doin' or else you'll regret what you've done
Don't come back tomorrow and say what we did wasn't right
You'll cry on your pillow and find it hard to sleep at night

Have you ever loved somebody
Don't you know just what it's like
Hurting someone that you're close to
Have you ever loved all night, all night

Remember what happened the last time that you said goodbye
Remember the sayin' that once bitten now means twice shy
It's no use me cryin' there is no denyin' it's right
But thinkin' has ruined the feeling that we had to fight

Have you ever loved somebody
Don't you know just what it's like
Hurting someone that you're close to
Have you ever loved all night, all night

If you hear people talkin' now
Will you laugh or cry?
If you cry I'll sympathize with you
If you laugh I'll die, if you laugh I'll die

Have you ever loved somebody
Don't you know just what it's like
Hurting someone that you're close to
Have you ever loved all night, all night

Have you ever loved somebody
Don't you know just what it's like
Hurting someone that you're close to
Have you ever loved all night, all night

Have you ever loved somebody
Don't you know just what it's like
Hurting someone that you're close to
Have you ever loved all night, all night
