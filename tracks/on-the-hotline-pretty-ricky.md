It's 5 in the mornin'
And I'm up havin' phone sex with you, you (so horny, so horny)
And now I'm on the hotline
Over here lustin' for you, you (so horny, so horny)
Let's talk about sex baby, let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about bubbles in the tub, let's talk about makin' love
Let's talk about you on top or me going down
Let's have a little phone sex baby, on the hotline

On the hotline, the sun ain't up but, I had to call you
'cause I'm home alone lustin' for you
I'm in my room, nothin' but a towel on
Take them granny panties off put a thong on
I love it when I hear you moan
You got that sexy tone that makes the dick long
You're in a complete norther city on the fan line with nothin' but a baby tee on
You're the kinda girl that's sexy in some boxer shorts
I'm the kinda player that make you ride it like a Porsche
Yeah, I met you on my space
Now I'm 'bout to fly you out to my place, in the mornin'



It's 5:30 in the mornin', good mornin'
I'm horny, I'm horny
I'm lonely, I'm lonely
I'm touchin' and rubbin'
Call me, call me, you're comin', you're comin'
Called you 7 times baby girl, don't stall me
I wanna kiss you from your temple to your feet
To the dimples in you cheek to the middle of you g-string
conversation underneath the sheet
You know me, redbull like an energy, I'm a freak

Baby girl said she loves phone sex
Say the sound of my deep voice make her wet
You call me 5 A.M. on the dot
Now I'm thinkin' 'bout you with no panties, no top
Picture this, you say you're comin' over
30 minutes later you was parkin' the Rover
Jumped out the car and I met you at the door
3 seconds in the house and your panties on the floor
Kiss you in you mouth and your hips on my cheeks
Straight action on the carpet, rug burns on my knees
Now you're on the phone like damn I made a mess
Got my hands in my pants, man, I love phone sex
