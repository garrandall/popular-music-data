(Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun d-d-duh-duh-duh)
 know why I do
(D-duh)

Don't know why I love you, don't know why I care
I just want, your love to share

I wonder why, I love you like I do
Is it because I think you love me too?
I wonder why, I love you like I do, like I do

I told my friends that we would never part
They often said that you would break my heart
I wonder why they think that we will part, we will part

When you're with me, I'm sure you're always true
When I'm away, I wonder what you do
I wonder why I'm sure you're always true, always true
Don't know why I do

(The d-duns, d-dahs, and doo-wops continue throughout the song both upfront and in the background so mentally fill them in for yourself, thank you)
