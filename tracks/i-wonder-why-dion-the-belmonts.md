Know why I love you like I do
Know why I do

Don't know why I love you
Don't know why I care
I just want your love to share

I wonder why I love you like I do
Is it because I think you love me to
I wonder why I love you like I do
Like I do

I told my friends that we would never part
They often said that you would break my heart
I wonder why they think that we will part
We will part

When you're with me I'm sure your always true
When I'm away I wonder what you do
I wonder why, I'm sure your always true
Always true

I wonder why I love you like I do
Is it because I think you love me too
I wonder why I love you like I do
Like I do

Know why I love you like I do
