Why do birds
Suddenly appear?
Everytime you are near
Just like me
They long to be
Close to you
Why do stars
Fall down from the sky?
Everytime you walk by
Just like me
They long to be
Close to you
(*) on the day that you were born
The angels got together and decided
To create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moondust in your hair
Of gold and starlight in your eyes of blue
(**) that is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me
They long to be
Close to you
Repeat (*)
Repeat (**)
Just like me
They long to be
Close to you
Woo... close to you...
