T-Kruger; who? Young Moola
Bitch just drop, shake like hoola
Hoopa, hoova, King Koopa
I'm the shit, poopa scoopa
Drunker than a mothafucka', out all night
Then she lookin' in my eyes sayin' you ain't right
Shit, you ain't right bitch I ain't wrong
And I faded going dumb to the thun thun song
It's a fuckin' house party, fuckin' somebody
Just 2 step no Ricky Bobby
Drop top to the summer I'm sorry
Pull up in tomorrow, two days to follow
Ready to get 'em your girl waitin' my nigga
What is you takin' my nigga
Fast car fast car why is you braking my nigga
Tastes like skittles tongue in the middle
Just don't don't


Don't drop that thun thun-nun (Ayy)
Don't drop that thun thun-nun
Don't drop that thun thun-nun (Ayy)
Don't drop that thun thun-nun
Don't drop that thun thun-nun
Don't drop that thun thun-nun
Don't drop that thun thun-nun (Ayy)
Don't drop that thun thun-nun
Don't drop that thun thun-nun
Don't drop that thun thun-nun


Alright oh my goodness I'm turnt up
I got a bottle you got a cup
You hit the Dougie

You're not with this I am inc. rep
Ha, you can make a chick about us
She know my whole crew, she know the song too
Ratchet boys in this shit like what it do
FiNNaTTic gang Ho now who the fuck are you
I'm easy, I'm never turnt down
Thizz face on girl this ain't no frown
Sippin' on lean somebody's girl goin' down
Like 3, 2, 1
Where your girl at now?
3 pills down, that's on me
And it wouldn't be a song if I didn't say Eeeiii!
So don't drop the thun thun
Girl turn the function up
And we gon' keep it goin' when the hook come back along

Say if you drop it (what?!)
Just pick it up
And grab a bad bitch and head to the cut (what?!)
Say if you drop it (what?!)
Just pick it up
And grab a bad bitch and head to the cut (what?!)
Say you a freak (what?!)
You're not a freak like me (what?!)
