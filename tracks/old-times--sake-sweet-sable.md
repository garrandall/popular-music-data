I know a place where we could go outside and have some fun
Just you and me, together we are one on one
I know you, you remember when we use to chill back when
Smokin' the blunt and sippin' on the Heineken

Long time no see
Whatcha been doin'
Is everything alright
I know you know, that I been coolin'
Even though, I been out of sight

This time don't leave me hangin around
I want you to love me down
Just you and me, baby you just wait
Let's get together for old time's sake

I know a place where we could go outside and have some fun
Just you and me, together we are one on one
I know you, you remember when we use to chill back when
Smokin' the blunt and sippin' on the Heineken

Let's take it slow
Can I have one more chance
To love you, I know that it will be fine
It seems to me
That you don't belong to another
And I know, that, we were meant to be

You are the only man that I need
Time will tell, you'll see what I mean
Let's have some fun
Do the things that we used to
Oh, let's get together
Just me and you

I know you, you remember when we use to chill back when
Smokin' the blunt and sippin' on the Heineken
I know a place where we could go outside and have some fun
Just you and me, together we are one on one
I know you, you remember when we use to chill back when
Smokin' the blunt and sippin' on the Heineken
I know a place where we could go outside and have some fun
Just you and me, together we are one on one
I know you, you remember when we use to chill back when
Smokin' the blunt and sippin' on the Heineken
