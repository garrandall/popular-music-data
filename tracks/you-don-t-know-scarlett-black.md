Don't believe the things
That people tell you
I know more
Than they ever could and
Somewhere there is someone
That feels the pain
The same as I do
Anger and confusion I feel inside
But what can I do

You don't know the way I feel inside
You don't know how much it hurts my pride
When I'm crying out to you

Tell me to be strong
It's easy to say
But when things go wrong
It's so hard to be
You and I share
The secrets of so many years
We've been together
Feeling exclusive can't be described
So I can't share it

You don't know the way I feel inside
You don't know how much it hurts my pride
When I'm crying out to you

You don't know the way I feel inside
You don't know how much it hurts my pride
You don't know

You don't know the way I feel inside
You don't know how much it hurts my pride

You don't know the way I feel inside
