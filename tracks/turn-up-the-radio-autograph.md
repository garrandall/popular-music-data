Turn it up
Oh!

Yeah!

I'm working hard you're working too
We do it everyday
For every minute I have to work
I need a minute to play
Day in day out all week long
Things go better with Rock
The only time I turn it down
Is when I'm sleeping it off

Turn up the radio
I need the music, give me some more
Turn up the radio
I wanna feel it, got to give me some more

Now listen
I wanna shake I wanna dance
Count it out to one, two, three
I feel the beat I'm in a trans
No better place to be
Day time night time anytime
Things go better with Rock
I'm going 24 hours a day
I can't seem to stop

Turn up the radio
I need the music, give me some more
Turn up the radio
I wanna feel it, got to give me some more

Turn up the radio
I wanna feel it, got to give me some more

Turn up the radio
I need the music, give me some more
Turn up the radio
I wanna feel it, got to give me some more

Turn up the radio
I need the music, give me some more
Turn up the radio
I wanna feel it, got to give me some more

Turn up the radio
I need the music, give me some more
Turn up the radio
I wanna feel it, got to give me some more
