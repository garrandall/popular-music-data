It don't really matter
Gonna find out for yourself
No it don't really matter
Gonna leave this thing to
Somebody else

If they were missionaries
Real time visionaries
Sitting in a Chinese stew
To view my dis-infatuation
I know that I'm a classic case
Watch my dis-enchanted face
Blame it on the Falun Gong
They've seen the end and you can't hold on now

'Cause it would take a lot more hate than you
To end the fascination
Even with an iron fist
More than you got to rule the nation
When all I got is precious time

It don't really matter
Guess I'll keep it to myself
Said it don't really matter
It's time I look around for
Somebody else

'Cause it would take a lot more time than you
Have got for masturbation
Even with your iron fist
More than you got to rule the nation
When all we got is precious time
More than you got to fool the nation
When all I got is precious time

It don't really matter
I guess you'll find out for yourself
No it don't really matter
So you can hear it now from
Somebody else

You think you got it all locked up inside
And if you beat them enough they'll die
It's like a walk in a park from the cell
Now you're keeping your own kind in hell
When your Great Wall rocks blame yourself
When their arms reach out for your help
And you're out of time
