Yeah, uh-huh
Mmm, yeah
(Ya)


You know, from the moment she turn around, ay
She know, how to back it up and drop it down
(Ya)
She know, she what all the fellas looking at, mmm
Cause they know, soon as her song come on it's a wrap, yeah
(Ya)


Cause she loves the attention
That she gets when she moves, yeah
Showing out with her home girls
Hypnotizing all the dudes, oh
(Ya)


She knows
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
She knows
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
She knows
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
I know, I know, she knows
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
And I know, I know, she knows

Oh, she knows
(Ya)


She bad, mixing ratchet with the classy, oh, yeah
Oh. So bad, I just couldn't let her pass me, no
Na na
(Ya)
I told her, "Shawty, you so right, but you so wrong"
(So wrong, so wrong, so wrong)
She said, "Daddy, I'll be back after this song"
"Then you taking me home"
(Ya)


Said I know she loves the attention
That she gets when she moves
Showing out with her home girls
And she got me watching too girl
(Ya)




She know what she working with
(She know, she know, she know)
I see you, uh
(Ya)
You got my attention baby, gone do what you do
Eviction notice, now you gone have to make a move
All this ice in my rolly, no wonder I play it cool
Ain't no 'I' in Team but
I got my eyes on you, I watch it bounce
When she walk, she lick her lips
When she talk
I throw her in that Bentley coupÃ© with the top off like Mardi Gras
All that cake, come get you some filling
Like a soap opera watch all my children
Hit it so long that she might lose feeling
With her legs in the air, she can walk on the ceiling
