O-oh
Hey girl, hey where ya goin'?
Come back and sit back down
You look too good to be
Heading home so early now
Say you gotta work tomorrow
Got a lot on your mind
Let me buy another round
Girl, I think you and I should just

Drink on it
Put our heads together and think on it
Maybe later on we can sleep on it
But for right now
Girl, we just need to drink on it

We can talk rocket science
Jesus or politics
How your boyfriend cheated on you
Man he sounds like such a prick
I could use another whiskey
And your Cosmo's gettin' low
While we're trying to figure out
The next place we should go

We can drink on it
Put our heads together and think on it
Maybe later on we can sleep on it
But for right now
Girl, we just need to drink on it

This place is closing down
But I don't wanna quit
Gotta good thing going girl
Let's find out what it is

And drink on it
Your place or mine
Girl, we can drink on it
Dust off a bottle and drink on it
Feels like we're doin' something right
Let's find a corner of the night

Where you and I can just drink on it
Put our heads together and think on it
Maybe later on we can sleep on it
But for right now
Girl, we just need to drink on it

Might make a memory that we won't forget

So let's just drink on it
Mmm
Drink on it
(Sleep on it)
(We can try to sleep on it)
