I got to have all your love
Both night and day, oh yeah
Not just a little part, but all of your heart
Oh yes I do, child

Ninety-nine and a half just won't do
No, ain't gonna get it, no

Don' t be led in the wrong direction, oh no
Start this thing, a man needs a little love and affection
Oh yes he do, child

Ninety-nine and a half just won't do
Just won't get it, no, no

We got to bring it all down
And start getting right, oh yes we do now child
Stop messin' around
And keep things up tight
Oh yeah
We got to realize that ninety-nine and a half just won't do
No, got to have a hundred, oh yeah

Got to have a hundred
Ain't no use in foolin' ourselves, honey
Lord, we ain't gonna be able to get by on ninety-nine
No, got to have a hundred

Lord have mercy
Just won't do no
Baby
It just won't do, now
