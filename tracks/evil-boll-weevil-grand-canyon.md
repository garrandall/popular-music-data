We now take you to the banks of the Chattahoochee River, the Snake pit Canyon
With  Ed Peach Tree and Evil Boll Weevil
Take  it away Ed

Alright thank you ladies and gentlemen
Right here on our canyon world-famous dare devil Evil Boll Weevil.
Alright  step over here Evil.
Few  questions before you jump over the Snake Pit Canyon and Chattahoochee River.
How was that cycle powered?
Gas. 
What will affect your jump the most?
Summer breeze.
Evil, when you were a child, what did you want to be?
Rocket  man.
Well your parents were against that, now, what did you tell them?
It's my life, and I'll do what I want.
Alright now what has your wife said about your stunt?
You got to change your evil ways.
Well has the thought of dying ever concerned you?
No I never ever think of it at all.
Well if you don't survive, where do you want to be buried?
Sweet home Alabama.
Where are you going, Evil? Come back! There he goes.
Well by-golly he made it. Come back over here Evil.
Well good going Evil. What was the first thing you thought about when you took off?
Help me I think I'm falling.
And then what?
When are you gonna come down?
How about when you landed?
Baby you're a rich man.
How fast were you traveling up there, Evil?
Seventy-five or eighty miles an hours.
Where would you have landed if you missed the other side?
Here, there and everywhere.
Alright now I'm serious, now where would you have been?
Rock and roll heaven.
Well I saw you talking to your wife over there, what was the first thing she said?
Feel like making love.
Oh you want more children, well what do you want?
Million dollar baby.
Had you survived the jump, but had been unsuccessful, what would you have done?
Go back, Jack, and do it again.
Well now if you jump again, now, what will you jump.

Now I know you have to go Evil, I know you have many engagements, what are some of them?
Boston. Denver. LA. That shack outside La Grange.
Thank you very much Evil. This is Ed Peachtree returning us to our studios.
