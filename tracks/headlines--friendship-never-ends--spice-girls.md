The time is now or never
To fit the missing piece
To take this on together
You make me feel complete
We fall into the future
And through the looking glass
The light shines over our heads
And so it comes to pass


To go beyond the surface
To reach into your soul
This love is not demanding
My heart has told me so
I hold onto my hero with faith enough to fly
The power to imagine will keep this love alive


Let's make the headlines loud and true
I wanna tell the world I'm givin' it all to you
Let's make the headlines loud and clear
The best things suddenly happen when you are here
If I lost my way you'd carry me home
Take me all the way to heaven never leave me alone
( Everything matters when you're near)
And it's just like everything matters when you are near


And it feels so good every bell's gonna ring
Your love is alive and it's making me sing
I could fly, wanna cry, want the whole world to know
We are together, come on baby let's go


And words yet to be spoken
Will fall upon the page
Spelling out true devotion
Is all we need to say


Let's make the headlines, loud and true
(Say you love me and I'll say I love you too)
I wanna tell the world I'm giving it all to you
(Just remember what simple words can do)
Let's make the headlines, loud and clear
(All that I have I give to you my friend)
The best things suddenly happen when you are here
(Just remember friendship never ends)
If I lost my way you'd carry me home
Take me all the way to heaven, never leave me alone
( Everything matters when you're near)
And it's just like everything matters when you are near
(Say you love me and I'll say I love you too)


Let's make the headlines true this time
(Just remember what simple words can do)
There's no hiding from this magical state of mind
(I feel loved, I feel, I feel loved)
If I lost my way you'd carry me home
(I know you'd take me all the way to heaven)
Take me all the way to heaven, never leave me alone
And it's just like everything matters when you are near
(Everything matters, it really matters)

Let's make the headlines loud and true
(I feel loved, I feel, I feel loved)
Let's make the headlines


'Cause I'm giving it all
Yeah I'm giving it all to you
