You're adding insult to injury
How much does my heart have to hurt?
Ain't it enough that you're through with me
Do you have to drag my pride through the dirt?

Must you praise your new love
Right in front of me?
Does it make you feel better?
Make you feel better
Adding insult to injury

You're going out of your way
To be cruel to me
Each time I show my face around
Ain't it enough you made a fool of me
Do you have to lash while I'm still down?

Must you praise your new love
Right in front of me?
Does it make you feel better?
I hope it makes you feel better
Adding insult to my injury
