Whatever you got, I want
Whatever you want
I'll give to you
Whatever you got, I want
Whatever it takes
I'm willing to do, girl

Your eyes speak
Your walk is rhythm in motion
You're too hot to handle
You're full of emotion, girl

My pride's weak
I can tell I'm standing in line again, yeah
(In line again)
When you pass by
Guys double take
It's a crime, yeah

Where there's a will there's a way
(Say it)
Even with the games you play
Girl, you've got a one track mind
(I'll make you mine)
I'll make you mine to stay, now, now

Whatever you got, I want
Whatever you want
I'll give to you
Whatever you got, I want
Whatever it takes
I'm willing to do, girl

You got me
Right on your finger tips
But I'm gonna keep my balance
I won't slip
Your sunshine ain't gonna melt my heart, yeah
If you let it shine on me
We'll never part

Where there's a will there's a way
(Say it)
Even with the games you play
Girl, you've got a one track mind
I'll make you mine to stay, now, now

Whatever you got, I want
Whatever you want
I'll give to you
Whatever you got, I want
Whatever it takes
I'm willing to do, girl
Yeah, yeah
Now

Whatever you got, I want
Whatever it takes
I'm willing to do
