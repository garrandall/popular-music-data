Papa don't take no mess
Papa is the man who can understand
How a man has to do
Whatever he can


Papa don't, Papa don't, Papa don't
Papa don't take no mess, no
He don't take no mess


Now Papa might grin
Drink a little taste of gin
Bet his last ten on
A little game of skins, hit me


Papa don't take no mess
Papa don't, Papa don't, Papa don't
Papa don't, Papa don't
Papa don't take no mess, hey, hey


Papa digs the chick
If she look real slick
Papa rap is very quick
He defintely isn't no trick

Oh, yeah


Papa don't, Papa don't, Papa don't
Papa don't, Papa don't
Papa don't take no mess
Papa is the man
Who will take a stand
Papa don't take no mess
Papa don't, Papa don't
Papa don't, don't, Papa don't

Look, dig this


Papa didn't cuss
He didn't raise a whole lotta fuss
But when we did wrong
Papa beat the hell out of us


Papa don't, Papa don't
Papa don't take no mess


I saw Papa cry when he
Thought that I would die
Lookie here
I saw papa cry
I saw Papa cry when he
Thought that I would die
He says something was in his eye
I knew it was a lie
Papa loves his son
Mama said Papa's smart
Papa got a whole lot of heart
And Papa would do his part
When the game get hard, hit me
