I know the reason you've been cryin'
And I heard she won't be needin' you
How does it feel, bein' the one left behind
(What's a matter baby) What's a matter baby, is she hurtin' you?

And I heard you found out she's been cheatin'
Oh yeah and I heard she even thought that she was untrue
Well how does it feel being on the outside lookin' in
(What's a matter baby) What's a matter baby, is she hurtin' you?

What's a matter baby, is she hurtin' you?
What's a matter baby, is she hurtin' you?

Remember, remember when I needed you so bad
Remember, what you had to say
You told me Little girl, find another sooner... (too much noise here)
You left, you left then and you walked away
I know, I know that hou've been askin' about me
(What's a matter baby) well I'm sorry baby but I've got somebody new
Whoa, whoa, whoa my hurt, my hurt, my hurt is just about over
Well let me tell you somethin' baby, it's just startin' for you

What's a matter baby, is she hurtin' you?
What's a matter baby baby baby, that girl has she been hurtin' you?

What's a matter baby?

(Spoken:)
What's a matter, uh?
Come on boy, you can tell me
Remember I'm a very good friend of yours
Yes and I know a little bit about pain
Does it hurt?...
Does it hurt, uh? What's a matter baby?...
