Number please

Hot line, hot line
Calling on the hot line
For your love, for your love
Hot line, hot line
Calling on the hot line
On the hot line

I'm calling on the hot line for your love
Baby, 'cause I'm burnin' up
Like a house on fire
My desire is climbin' higher, baby

Girl, the way you move your lips
I can tell you got fire in your kiss
The way you flash your eyes
Looks like lightnin' lightin' up the sky

Stop all the calls in the world
Till I catch you, girl
Catch you at home
I asked the C.I.A
If it was okay to use their private phone
Oh, baby, baby

Hot line, hot line
Calling on the hot line
For your love, for your love
Hot line, hot line
Calling on the hot line
On the hot line

Operator, excuse me please
But this is more than an emergency
Take those phones off-a your ears
'Cause this is only for my baby to hear

Stop all the calls in the world
Till I catch you, girl
Catch you at home
I asked the C.I.A
They said it was okay to use their private phone
Oh, baby, baby

Hot line, hot line
Calling on the hot line
For your love, for your love
Hot line, hot line
Calling on the hot line
On the hot line

Baby, where are you? Here am I
Should I get in touch with the F.B.I
I know my call will be accepted
There's no chance of bein' disconnected

On the hot line, hot line
Calling on the hot line
For your love, for your love
Hot line, hot line
Calling on the hot line
On the hot line

Don't keep it busy, don't make me dizzy
Your love makes me want to shout
You're my lover, undercover
You know what I'm talkin' about

Hot line, hot line
Calling on the hot line
For your love, for your love
