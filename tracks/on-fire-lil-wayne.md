Mama bad, mama mean
Gasoline, she’s on fire
Put her out, as a matter of fact
Take her out, cause she’s on fire
Got on my knees and asked my Lord
To keep me clear from the Devil cause my girl
She, she’s on fire, yeah
But everything is so cool, yeah


Now gimme them back shots, I want them back shots
I said shorty let me play up in that matchbox
And she’s on fire, yeah
Sh-shorty let a nigga rub his dick against her matchbox
And she's on fire, she’s steamin'
She’s screamin', she, she’s creamin'
She’s fiendin', I redeem it
I get between it, like I mean it


Now hit me
And now she's on fire
I left her steamin', yeah
But everything is so cool


Uhh, she hot as hell, let's call her Helen
Uhh, fireman to her rescue like 9-11
Uhh, fuckin' right I make her hot
She got the Devil in her, I do whatever with her
Hell's angel, I pluck her feathers nigga
I am the firespitter, I start a fire with her
Okay her flames high, but I am higher nigga
So I invite her up, and then I light her up, uhh


Mama bad, mama mean
Kerosene, she’s on fire
Put her out, as a matter of fact
Take her out, she’s on fire
Got on my knees and asked my Lord
To keep me clear from the Devil cause my girl
She's on fire, yeah
But everything is so cool, yeah


Now hit me, haha, woo!
She's on fire, yeah
I left her stingin'
Yeah, and now she's on fire
Haha (but it's cool)
Mama bad, mama mean
Gasoline, she’s on fire
Put her out, as a matter of fact
T-t-take her out, cause she’s on fire
She, she’s steamin'
She’s screamin', she creamin'
She’s fiendin', I redeem it
I get between it, like I mean it
Hehe, then I leave her stingin'
Now she's on fire, stingin'!
But everything is so cool
