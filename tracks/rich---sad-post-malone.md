Hundred thousand for the chain and now my drop (drop, drop)
When I pull out the garage, I chop my top (top, top)
Just like a fiend, when I start I cannot stop (whoa)
I got, I got hella guap, look at me now (at me now)
Oh, covered in carats, oh, mahogany cabinets
Oh, I ball like the Mavericks, oh, stable and stallions
Oh, massive medallions, oh, I finally had it
Oh, but then you just vanished, damn, I thought I was savage

All this stuntin' couldn't satisfy my soul
Got a hundred big places, but I'm still alone

Ayy, I would throw it all away
I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay
You ain't never cared about that bullshit anyway
I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay, ayy
You know I would throw it all away
I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay
Price went up, my price went up, we went our separate ways
I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay, ayy, ayy

Buy me love, tried to buy me love
Now I'm alone, Ice Box, Omarion (oh)
Plenty sluts grabbin' on my nuts (woah)
Might have fucked, it was only lust (trust)
I was livin' life, how could I have known? (could have known)
Couldn't listen to advice 'cause I'm never wrong (oh)
In the spotlight, but I'm on my own (oh)
Now that you're gone (now that you're gone)

All this stuntin' couldn't satisfy my soul
Got a hundred big places, but I'm still alone

Ayy, I would throw it all away
I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay
You ain't never cared about that bullshit anyway
I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay, ayy
You know I would throw it all away
I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay
Price went up, my price went up, we went our separate ways
I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay, ayy, ayy

I don't even wanna go home
In a big house all alone (alone)
I don't even wanna go home (no, no, no)
But I'ma try to call you on the phone
Brrt

I would throw it all away
I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay
You ain't never cared about that bullshit anyway
I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay (made you stay) ayy
You know I would throw it all away
I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay (made you stay)
Price went up, my price went up, we went our separate ways (separate ways)
I just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay (made you stay) ayy, ayy
