Dark city streets
Twist and moan in the heat
As night descends
Two searching eyes
Cut their way into mine
Inviting me in

Dancing so close
We already know
How good it will be
We slip out
From the unseeing crowd
We find what we need

In the heart of the night
We run like bandits
(In the heart of the night)
Two hungry hearts under the gun
In the heart of the night
(Heart of the night)
When we find each other
We're stealing love on the run
In the heart of the night
Heart of the night

The cool city moon
Lays its touch on the room
Your eyes reach to me
Two shadows fall
Saying nothing at all
We know what we need

In the release
Two prisoners are free
From all darkness
One more escape
Surviving the heartache
And madness

In the heart of the night
We run like bandits
(In the heart of the night)
Two hungry hearts under the gun
In the heart of the night
(Heart of the night)
When we find each other
We're stealing love on the run
In the heart of the night
Heart of the night

In the heart of the night
(Heart of the night)
When we find each other
We're stealing love on the run
In the heart of the night
Heart of the night

In the heart of the night
In the heart of the night
(In the heart of the night)
