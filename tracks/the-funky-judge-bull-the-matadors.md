I didn't do it
I didn't do it, officer
I didn't do it, his honor
I didn't do it

Judge, you sure is funky
Judge, you sure is funky
Judge, you sure is funky
Judge, you sure is funky

Now, listen
I didn't do it, your honor
I didn't do it, judge

Judge, you sure is funky
(Got to be funky)
Judge, you sure is funky

Judge, judge, judge
Judge, judge, oww

Judge, you sure is funky
(Got to be a funky judge)
Judge, you sure is funky
Judge, you sure is funky
Judge, you sure is funky

Now, listen
I didn't do it, your honor
What she told you was a lie
I call on my mother, woo
She'll give you a alibi

I didn't do it, your honor
She told you a lie
And now you're gonna
Send me away and
I wanna know why

Judge, you sure is funky
(Got to be a funky judge)
Judge, you sure is funky
(Good God almighty)
Judge, you sure is funky
Judge, you sure is funky

Now listen
I didn't do it, your honor
I didn't do it, judge

Judge, you sure is funky
(Got to be a funky judge)
Judge, you sure is funky

Judge, judge, judge
Judge, judge, oww
Judge

(Where you from, boy)
I'm from Alabama, your honor
(Seventeen years) what
I didn't do it
