For those who fancy coloring book
As certain people do
He's a new one for you
A most unusual coloring book

The kind you never see
Crayons ready, very well
Begin to color me
These are the eyes that watched him

As he walked away
Color them gray
This is the heart that thought
He would always be true

Color it blue
These are the arms that held him
And touched him then lost him somehow
Color them empty now

These are the beads I wore
Until she came between
Color them green
This is the room I sleep in

And walk in and weep in
Hiding that nobody sees
Color it lonely, please
This is the man

The one I depended upon
Color him go...
