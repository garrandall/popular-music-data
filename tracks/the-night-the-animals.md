Well, here comes the night
Its dark shadows passing over me
I've been feeling the chill
Ever since you been gone

I'm thinking of you, girl
Wondering if you're going
To return to me
Or was it a waste of time
All we've been through

When I'm all alone
I don't have someone I can run to
Baby, I ain't got no place to go

Don't you know that the night
Keeps moving on (keeps moving on)
Keeps getting colder and colder
The night, always too long
(Always too long) I keep
Looking over my shoulder

The night, I pray for the dawn
(Pray for the dawn)
Keeps getting colder and colder
The night, always too long
Baby, you're gone

We could start again
If only you would
Reach out and touch me, baby
Like a blind man
I feel you deep down inside

I'm over the edge
I'm sorry I hurt
You so badly, girl
The things that I said
Just cannot be denied

When I'm waiting here
Hoping that someday you'll
Return to me cause, baby
Feel like I'm losing control

Don't you know that the night
Keeps moving on (keeps moving on)
Keeps getting colder and colder
The night, always too long
(Always too long) I keep
Looking over my shoulder

The night, I pray for the dawn
(Pray for the dawn)
Keeps getting colder and colder
The night, always too long
Baby, you're gone

My mind's running wild
I feel like a child
Who's been lost again
You've stolen my heart
Captured my soul

Don't you know that the night
Keeps moving on (keeps moving on)
It keeps getting colder and colder
The night, always too long
(Always too long) Keeps
Getting colder and colder

The night, I pray for the dawn
(Pray for the dawn)
Keeps getting colder and colder
The night, I pray for the dawn

Yeah, the night, the night
(Keeps moving on)
Yeah, colder and colder
The night, always too long
(Always too long) it keeps
Getting colder and colder

The night, keep moving on
(Pray for the dawn) keep
Looking over my shoulder
The night, it's always too long
