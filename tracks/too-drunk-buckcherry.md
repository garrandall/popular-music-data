I guess we’re doing, uh, too drunk to fuck right?


I hit the bottle in the morning in the summer time
I quit my job because it gets in the way
Find a party by the ocean, buy the cheapest wine
Called up my friends to come and waste the day
I got a dime bag, corduroys, coloured sleeves
And a bindle and some LSD
Now I'm just looking for a girl to meet
To help me forget my name


I could spend my lifetime getting high
Never wanna live in a suit and tie
Most of us are just living a lie
That’s why we get fucked up every night
I'm getting drunk all night
Oh I'm getting drunk all day
Oh I'm getting drunk all night
I'm sorry but I have to say, I'm too drunk to fuck (ya)
(I'm sorry but I have to say, I'm too drunk to fuck ya)


Now the party was jumping and the girls were flying
With the lipstick summer glaze
Got so many women coming after me
I put some pussy on lay away
I was smoked out, tore up, drunk as fuck
And I wouldn't wanna change a thing
Young and dumb and full of cum
With a sugar loaded candy cane

I can’t eat, can’t sleep and I'm bored as fuck
And the girl I want just walked away
She just found out I'm too drunk to fuck
Looks like I'm not getting laid

Yeah! No, too drunk to fuck you, oh
I'm too drunk to fuck you, somebody, help me!
Lord have mercy, somebody help me I can't fucking breathe
I'm too drunk to fuck!
