I hit the bottle in the morning in the summer time
I quit my job cause it gets in the way
I find a party by the ocean buy the cheapest wine
Call up my friends to waste the day

I gotta dime bag, corduroys, colored sleeves,
And a bimble and some LSD
Now Iâm just looking for a girl to meet
To help me forget my name

I could spend my lifetime getting high
Never wanna live in a suit and tie
Most of us are just livin a lie
Thatâs why we get  fucked up  every night

Oh Iâll get drunk all night
Oh Iâll get drunk all day
Oh Iâll get drunk all night
Iâm sorry but I have to say
Iâm too drunk to fuck

Now the party was jumpin
And the girls were fine, with the lipstick summer glaze
I got so many women comin after me
I put some pussy on layaway

I was smoked out, tore up, drunk as fuck
And I wouldnât wanna change a thing
Young and dumb and full of cum
With a sugar loaded candy cane

I could spend my lifetime getting high
Never wanna live in a suit and tie
Most of us are just livin a lie
Thatâs why we get  fucked up  every night

Oh Iâll get drunk all night
Oh Iâll get drunk all day
Oh Iâll get drunk all night
Oh Iâll get drunk all day

Oh Iâll get drunk all night
Oh Iâll get drunk all day
Oh Iâll get drunk all night
Iâm sorry but I have to say
Iâm too drunk to fuck ya!

Iâm too drunk to fuck ya!

I canât eat, canât sleep, and Iâm bored as fuck
And the girl I want just walked away
She just found out Iâm too drunk to fuck
It looks like Iâm not getting laid

I could spend my lifetime getting high
Never wanna live in a suit and tie
Most of us are just livin a lie
Thatâs why we get  fucked up  every night

Oh Iâll get drunk all night
Oh Iâll get drunk all day
Oh Iâll get drunk all night
Oh Iâll get drunk all day

Oh Iâll get drunk all night
Oh Iâll get drunk all day
Oh Iâll get drunk all night
Iâm sorry but I have to say
Iâm too drunk to fuck ya!

Iâm too drunk to fuck ya!

Iâm too drunk to fuck ya

Somebody help me

Lord have mercy, Somebody help me
Iâm canât fucking breathe
Iâm too drunk to fuck!
