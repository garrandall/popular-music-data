Hey everybody, get out of the street now
I hear the roar of an XK-E now
Flops and sweater and ponytail
And the cop on the corner is turnin' pale
Whoa, it's Abigail Beecher
Our history teacher

All the kids are just crazy about her
Central High would be a drag without her
She knows her history from A to Z
She'd teach a monkey in Watusi
Whoa, it's Abigail Beecher
Our history teacher
Whoa

We're out in the hall and changin' classes
Plays guitar, wears blue sunglasses
She's friendly, pop'lar and a real swinger
She's gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
Whoa, it's Abigail Beecher
Our history teacher
Whoa

History class is gettin' bigger and bigger
They come for miles 'cause they really dig her
The PTA was really floored
When she walked in with a red surfboard
Whoa, it's Abigail Beecher
Our history teacher

Whoa

Come on, girl
Aw, you're too much
Whoa
Come on, girl
Whoa
