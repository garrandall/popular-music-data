Breathe in breathe out
Breathe in breathe out
Breathe in

Breathe in breathe out
Breathe in breathe out
Breathe in

Tied to a wheel our fingers got to feel
Bleeding through a tourniquet smile
I spin on a whim I slide to the right
I felt you like electric light

For our love
For our fear
For our rise against the years and years and years

Got a machinehead
It's better than the rest
Green to red machinehead

Got a machinehead
It's better than the rest
Green to red

And I walk from my machine
I walk from my machine

Breathe in breathe out
Breathe in breathe out
Breathe in

Deaf, dumb, dirty
Starting to deserve this
Leaning on my conscience wall
Blood is like wine
Unconscious all the time
If I had it all again
I'd change it all

Got a machinehead
It's better than the rest
Green to red machinehead

Got a machinehead
It's better than the rest
Green to red

And I walk from my machine
I walk from my machine

"Just minding my chemistry
Just minding my chemistry
It's a foul ball"

Breathe in breathe out
Breathe in breathe out
Breathe in
Breathe in
Breathe in

Got a machinehead
It's better than the rest
Green to red machinehead
Got a machinehead
It's better than the rest
Green to red

It's better than the rest

It's better than the rest
Machinehead

And I walk from my machine
I walk from my machine
