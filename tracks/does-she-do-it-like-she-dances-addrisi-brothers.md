Sitting at the bar
Talking to a friend
Sipping on some wine
Making time

Then our favorite record played
So I turned towards the crowd
And the dancing lady
Made me spill my wine

She was wild, she was free
She moved so temptively
Every guy had one question
On their mind

Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
Dances, dances

Finished up my drink
And was headed for the door
When I saw that lady
Giving me the eye

So we danced the night away
I hope that she will stay
And maybe I will find out
By and by

Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
Dances, dances

Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
I hope she does it like she dances

Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
I hope she does it like she dances

Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances...
