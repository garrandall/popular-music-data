Do you want to dance and hold my hand?
Tell me baby I'm your lover man
Oh baby, do you want to dance?

Do you do you do you do you want to dance
Do you do you do you do you want to dance
Do you do you do you do you want to dance

Well do you want to dance under the moonlight?
Squeeze me baby all through the night
Oh baby, do you want to dance?

Do you do you do you do you want to dance
Do you do you do you do you want to dance
Do you do you do you do you want to dance

Well do you want to dance under the moonlight?
Squeeze me baby all through the night
Oh baby, do you want to dance
