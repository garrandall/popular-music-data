You know you want me
You want this


My girls, goin 'round talking
They say that you've been watchin' me boy
I know by the way you're talking
That you're really tryin' to get to me boy
Not anyone I'll just let in my heart
You have to be hungry for me


Girls may have been easy
But you have to please me
What makes me think that I can say this to you
I know how bad you want this


If you want my future then
You better work it boy
No it won't come easy
I know you want this
By the time I'm through with you
You'll be begging me for more

You want this


I know your whole story
Because you're fine boy, and you know it
You think that you can have me
Just listen closely, no it ain't so easy
Every word you said I have heard before


Girls may have been easy
But you have to please me
One thing I've been told, nothing else compares
To this loving body


If you want my future then
You better work it boy
No it won't come easy no
I know you want this
By the time I'm through with you
You'll be begging me for more
So you want my loving
I know you want this

If you want my future then
You better work it boy
No it won't come easy no
I know you want this
By the time I'm through with you
You'll be begging me for more


You want this
Don't you?
You want this
Say it



You want this, you know it's true
You want this, you know it
You want this, you know it's true
You want this, you know it
You want this?
You want this?
Can you handle this?
Well, come here then


Early in the mornin'
You want this
Late in the evening
You want this
Just about around midnight
You want this
'Cause you know i'll do you right, baby
You want this
What's my name boy?
You want this
'Cause you gotta say my name, boy
You want this
Just a little bit louder now
You want this
Just a little bit softer now
You want this
Nice and easy
You want this
You want this
You want this
You want this
You want this
