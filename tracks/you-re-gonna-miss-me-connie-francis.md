One kiss, one little sigh
That's all you gave me
When you said goodbye
But someday, baby
Someday, darlin'
You're gonna miss me

Long gone is your caress
And with it all my happiness
But someday baby, someday darlin'
You're gonna miss me
Oh, oh, oh, yes

One of these nights
You'll wake up cryin'
But I won't be there to comfort you
You'll turn on the light
But you'll go on cryin'
'Cause only my true love
Can chase away your blues

Oh yes, you're gonna learn
I'm not the only one
Whose heart will burn
'Cause someday, baby
Someday darlin'
You're gonna miss me
Miss me, miss me, miss me

Someday baby, someday darling
You're gonna miss me
Oh yeah...
