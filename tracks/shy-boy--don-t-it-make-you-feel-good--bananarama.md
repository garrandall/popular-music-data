He used to be a shy boy
Until I made him my boy
I never missed a heartbeat
Just sitting in the back seat

I'm gonna give him all my love
Each and every night
One thing I know he's dreaming of
I wanna squeeze and hold him tight

But don't it make you feel good
(Shoop shoop ah)
And don't it make you feel good
(Shoop shoop ah)
Don't it make you feel good
(Shoop shoop ah)
And don't it make you feel good
(Shoop shoop ah)

Everything we put together
Seems to last forever
He knows about a good time
Gonna make him all mine

He gives me lovin like nobody else
I like the way he turns me on
I wanna keep him all to myself
If my heart could beat that strong

But don't it make you feel good
(Shoop shoop ah)
And don't it make you feel good
(Shoop shoop ah)
Don't it make you feel good
(Shoop shoop ah)
And don't it make you feel good
(Shoop shoop ah)

I'm gonna give him all my love
Each and every night
One thing I know he's dreaming of
I wanna squeeze and hold him tight

But don't it make you
(Shoop shoop ah)
But don't it make you
(Shoop shoop ah)

He gives me lovin like nobody else
I like the way he turns me on
I wanna keep him all to myself
If my heart could beat that strong

But don't it make you feel good
(Shoop shoop ah)
And don't it make you feel good
(Shoop shoop ah)
Don't it make you feel good
(Shoop shoop ah)
And don't it make you feel good
(Shoop shoop ah)

But don't it make you feel good
(Shoop shoop ah)
And don't it make you feel good
(Shoop shoop ah)
Don't it make you feel good
(Shoop shoop ah)
And don't it make you feel good
(Shoop shoop ah)
