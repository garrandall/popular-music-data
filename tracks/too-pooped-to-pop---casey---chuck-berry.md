Casey is an old man who wants to be a teen
He goes to all the dances and they call him cha-cha king
He cha-chas when the band is playin' rock and roll
He tries to keep in time but the beat leaves him cold. 

Because he's too pooped to pop, too old a soul
Hips gettin' weaker when he tries to do the stroll
And every time his feet get to go in one way
Here comes a new dance and it's goin' to stray.

Chicks told Casey, You better move man,
This is only a one night stand
Casey wasn't in time but he was dancin' awhile
Till a cramp caught his leg and he had to change his style. 

Because he's too pooped to pop, too old a soul
Hips gettin' weaker when he tries to do the stroll
And every time his feet get to go in one way
Here comes a new dance and it's goin' to stray.

Because he's too pooped to pop, too old a soul
Hips gettin' weaker when he tries to do the stroll
And every time his feet get to go in one way
Here comes a new dance and it's goin' to stray.

Casey finally learned to do the hoochie koo
This might have been fine back in '22
Now, I'm gonna give you fellows just a little tip
If you wanna keep your girl you'd better get hip
Or, you'll be too pooped to pop, too old a soul
You hips are gettin' weaker when you'll try to do the stroll
And every time your feet gettin' to go in one way
Here comes a new dance you'll be left to stray.
