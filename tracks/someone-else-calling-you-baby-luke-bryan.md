I saw a truck backin' out of your drive
You were sitting in the passenger side
Messin' with the radio, you had your sun glasses on
I pulled over cause I couldn't believe
Two weeks ago that was you and me
Riding down these old back roads, singing our songs
Now everybody round our town's been whisperin'
A tear in your eye says I should have been listenin'

Baby is someone else calling you baby
It's driving me crazy
This being in the dark
Goodbye ain't never easy
So break it to me hard
If you're over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don't try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?

You wanted time and you wanted your space
So I backed off, did whatever it takes
Never really thought you were that ready for moving along
Now I ain't leaving till I hear you say what's going on
It'll be what it will be, its either him or me
Give me the word and girl I'm gone

Baby is someone else calling you baby
It's driving me crazy
This being in the dark
Goodbye ain't never easy
So break it to me hard
If you're over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don't try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?

No Goodbye ain't never easy
So break it to me hard
If you're over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don't try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
No, don't try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
Is someone else calling you baby?
