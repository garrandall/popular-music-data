(Stop)
Oh yes, wait a minute Mr Postman
(Wait)
Wait Mr Postman


Please Mr Postman, look and see

Oh yeah

If there's a letter in your bag for me

Please, Please Mr Postman

Why's it takin' such a long time

Oh yeah

For me to hear from that boy of mine


There must be some word today
From my boyfriend so far away

Please Mr Postman, look and see
If there's a letter, a letter for me


I've been standin' here waitin' Mr Postman
So patiently

For just a card, or just a letter
Sayin' he's returnin' home to me


Mr Postman

Mr Postman, look and see

Oh yeah

If there's a letter in your bag for me

Please, Please Mr Postman

Why's it takin' such a long time

Oh yeah

For me to hear from that boy of mine

Stop


So many days you passed me by
See the tears standing in my eyes

You didn't stop to make me feel better
By leaving me a card or a letter


Mr Postman

Mr Postman, look and see

Oh yeah

If there's a letter in your bag for me

Please, Please Mr Postman

Why's it takin' such a long time


Why don't you check it and see one more time for me, you gotta

Wait a minute, Wait a minute
Wait a minute, Wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute

Mr Postman, look and see


C'mon deliver the letter, the sooner the better


Please Mr Postman, look and see

Oh yeah

If there's a letter in your bag for me

Please, Please Mr Postman

Why's it takin' such a long time

Oh yeah

For me to hear from that boy of mine


Wait a minute, Wait a minute ( Oooh yeah)
Wait a minute, Wait a minute ( Oooh oooh)
Wait a minute, wait a minute

Come on deliver the letter, the sooner the better


Stop, oh yes wait a minute Mr Postman
