Whoa, yeah

Countrymen, friends, lend me your ears
I'll tell you a tale of fifteen years
I'm an old man that's so forlorn
I wanna see the city where I was born

I got a feeling that I can't stand
I wanna go home to my homeland
Ain't got no money, I ain't got a cent
I can't get on that train to help me

Show me the way to St.Louis
Show me the way
Show me the way to St.Louis
Show me the way
Come on, people, gotta get moving
Come on, people, gotta get grooving
Show me the way to St.Louis
Show me the way

Step up to me, you city gents
And I'll clean your shoes for fifteen cents
I'll fix your tie, you'll look a smash
If you don't mind, I'll take the cash

Soon I'll get the money and I'll feel fine
To pack my bags and drink my wine
I only know I got to go home
The good Lord told me so, so help me

Show me the way to St.Louis
Show me the way
Show me the way to St.Louis
Show me the way
Come on, people, gotta get moving
Come on, people, gotta get grooving
Show me the way to St.Louis
Show me the way

Which train goes to Louis
You know I got the fare
I know my time's coming fast
I got to try to raise the fare

Come on, people, gotta get moving
Come on, people, gotta get grooving
Show me the way to St.Louis
Show me the way
Show me the way to St.Louis
Show me the way

Louis, Louis, Louis, Louis
Louis, Louis, Louis, Louis...

Show me the way to St.Louis
Show me the way
Show me the way to St.Louis
Show me the way
Show me the way to St.Louis
Show me the way...
