I was born on a levy
A little bit south of Montgomery
Mama worked in the big house
And daddy he worked for the County

I never had no learnin' until I turned 16
When Joe Henry come up the river, yonder
Law, made a woman out of me
Lord, he made a woman outta me

I used to tease Joe Henry
Guess it served me right
Wasn't long till he left me
Crying out in the night

Joe Henry had his say, he wouldn't set me free
I fear to tell everybody
That the man made a woman outta me
Lord, he made a woman outta me

When I think back to that day so long ago
I get a little feelin' on my mind
Although it hurt me there's one thing I know
When he left, he left him a woman behind

When I meet another young man
Wantin' to love and run
My mind goes back to Joe Henry James
And a heck of a job he done

Ain't no other man let me down
You see I been set free
Ever since way back yonder
When Joe made a woman outta me

Lord, he made a woman outta me
Lord, he made a woman outta me
Joe made a woman outta me
Lord, he made a woman outta me

Joe made a woman outta me
Lord, he made a woman outta me
