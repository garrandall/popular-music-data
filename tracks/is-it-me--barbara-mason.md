Is it me or is it her
Tell me which one do you prefer
I love you (you know that it's you)
You know I do (baby, I love you)
I'm gonna ask you one more time
(Who do you choose)
Are you hers or are you mine
Is it me (who do you choose)
Is it her, Is it me, is it her
Is it me, is it her
Which one, baby, do you prefer
(It's you, baby)
Do you want her rather than me
(You know that it's you, baby)
I need to know how it's gonna be
(Baby, I love you)
You don't even know, my baby
(Who do you choose)
Which way your love will go
I'm a better woman than she
(Who do you choose)
If you don't believe it
Come try me
I'll love you in a way
(You know that it's you, baby)
You'll never forget (I love you)
I won't do anything to my baby
You'll regret
All the things I've said are true
(Who do you choose)
But the choice is up to you
(Who do you choose)
Is it me (who do you choose)
Is it her, is it me, is it her
Is it me, is it her
Which one, baby, do you prefer
I've gotta know, baby
Is it me or her
Which one, baby, is it gonna be
I've gotta know, baby
Is it her or me
Is it her or is it me
