You and I
We fit together like a glove on hand
That's right
Don't you know
That I would gladly take you anywhere
You wanted to go

You and me
We are as close as three-part harmony
Wouldn't you agree
And if by chance
Our romance ended it would surely be
The end of me


Some people might say I'm infatuated
But I don't care
Cause they really don't know
They'll never see or hear
The things I do with you
So far as I'm concerned
They all can go to hell


Whoe, baby yeah
Now sing it, sugar
Do-do-do
Now sing it, baby


You and I
We'll be together 'till the six is nine
That's right
When you need me
I never hesitate, I always come
It's so much fun, yeah

You and I
Although we're poor
Our love has greater wealth
Than Hughes himself
And if by chance
There is an afterlife when we die
Hope it's with you and I


Some people might say I'm infatuated
But I don't care
Cause they really don't know
They'll never see of hear
The things I do with you
So far as I'm concerned
They all can go to hell


Baby sing it for me
Sing it to me, baby
I said take it baby

You and I
You and me
We'll be together eternally
You and I
You and me
We'll be together eternally
You and I
You and me
We'll be together eternally
Eternally will be you and me

So you can move on the funk
Everybody dance on the funk
We're laying this groove
So you can move on the funk
Everybody dance on the funk
We're laying this groove
So you can move on the funk
Everybody dance on the funk
We're laying this groove
So you can move on the funk
Everybody dance on the funk
Everybody dance on the funk
Everybody dance on the funk
Everybody shake your booty 'round
Everybody shake your booty 'round
Everybody shake your booty 'round
Everybody shake your booty 'round
Everybody dance on the funk
