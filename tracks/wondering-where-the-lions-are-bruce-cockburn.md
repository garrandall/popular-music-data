Sun's up, mm, hmm, looks okay
The world survives into another day
And I'm thinking about eternity
And this ecstasy's got a hold on me
Yeah, I had another dream about lions at the door
They weren't half as frightening as they were before
I'm thinking about eternity
Some kind of ecstasy's got a hold on me
Walls windows trees, waves coming through
You'll be into me and I'll be into you
Together in eternity
All this ecstasy's got a hold on me
And I'm wonderin' where the lions are
Wonderin' where the lions are
Wonderin' where the lions are
Wonderin' where the lions are
I'm wonderin' where the lions are
Wonderin' where the lions are
Wonderin' where the lions are
Wonderin' where the lions are
Wonderin' where the lions are
Big orange flying boat rises off the lake
Thousand-year-old dinosaur doing a double take
Pointing a finger at eternity
I'm sitting here in the middle of this ecstasy
Last night again there where lions at the door
But I wasn't frightened like I was before
Thinking about eternity
And the ecstasy that's got a hold on me
And I'm wonderin' where the lions are
Wonderin' where the lions are
Wonderin' where the lions are
Wonderin' where the lions are
I'm wonderin' where the lions are
Wonderin' where the lions are
Wonderin' where the lions are
I'm wonderin'



Freighters on the nod on the surface of the bay
One of these days we're going to sail away
Sail into eternity
All this ecstasy's got a hold on me
And I'm wonderin' where the lions are
Wonderin' where the lions are
Wonderin' where the lions are
Wonderin' where the lions are
Tell me where the lions are
Wonderin' where the lions are
Tell me where the lions are
Tell me where the lions are
Tell me where they are
I wanna know
Where the lions are
