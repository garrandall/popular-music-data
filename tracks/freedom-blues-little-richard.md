I hope that I should live to see,
When every man can know he's free.
Sufferin' from the past.
I make I ought to be sad

I got my duty rock and roll,
Now everybody, everybody, everyone's gotta be free!
Oh...

Now la-la, la-da-da-da.
La-la, la-da da-da.

Mmm, let's get rid of that old man, hey-ey-ey,
And bring our government up to date.
It may be very hard to do,
Just open your mind, let love come through.

You hear me callin' you my?
Everybody, everybody, everyone's gotta be free!
Oh yes!

La-la, la-da-da-da.
La-la, la-da da-da.

We did our thing every thing and we paid our dues,
Now let's get rid of these freedom blues.
It may be very hard to do,
Just open your mind, let love come through.

I got my duty rock and roll,
Now everybody, everybody, everyone's gotta be free!
Oh...

La-la, la-da-da-da.
La-la, la-da da-da.
La-la, la-da-da-da.
La-la, la-da da-da.
