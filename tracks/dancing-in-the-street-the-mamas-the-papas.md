Callin' out around the world -
Are you ready for a brand new beat?
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancin' in the streets.

They're dancin' in Chicago,
Down in New Orleans,
Up in New York City.

All we need is music (sweet music),
Sweet music (sweet music).
There'll be music everywhere (everywhere);
There'll be swingin' and swayin' and records playin'
And dancin' in the streets.

Oh, it doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there.
So come on, every guy (come on) grab a girl
Everywhere around the world.
There'll be dancing -
They're dancing in the street

This is an invitation
Across the nation;
A chance for the folks to meet.
There'll be laughin', singin', and music swingin'
And dancin' in the streets.

Philadelphia, P.A. (Philadelphia, P.A.)
Baltimore and DC now (Baltimore and DC now)
Yeah, don't forget the Motor City.
(Can't forget the Motor City)
All we need is music (sweet music),
Sweet music (sweet music).
There'll be music everywhere (everywhere).
There'll be swingin' and swayin' and records playin'
And dancin' in the street, yeah.

Oh, it doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there.
So come on, every guy (come on, come on) grasp a girl
Everywhere around the world...

There'll be dancin',
Be dancin' in the streets
Philadelphia, P.A. (Philadelphia, P.A.)
Baltimore and DC now (Baltimore and DC now)
Can't forget that Motor City.
(Can't forget the Motor City)
Way down in L.A., California
(Way down in L.A., California)

Not to mention Halifax, Nova Scotia (Not to mention, indeed)
Or Long Barn they do that Riverdale, Cream you know (Yes, I know)
Manchester? (And, oh, Amherst, Amherst)
Alexandria? (Virginia, Virginia)
Falls Church (Where's that?)(Alabama)
Oh Boyle Heights! (Boyle Heights, never heard of it)
