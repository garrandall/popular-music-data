You're happy now it's plain to see you're not concerned with your old used to be's
You could at least show some sympathy you're happy I see what about me
You pass me by with your head up high
You've known regrets since we said goodbye
You've got no heartaches or misery you're happy I see what about me
What about me what about me
Those sweet words you said were just words to deceive
What about me what about me I'm left with the promises you didn't keep
Someday you may find a love untrue you'll feel the same way I feel about you
You could at least show some sympathy you're happy I see what about me

You could at least show some sympathy you're happy I see what about me
What about me
