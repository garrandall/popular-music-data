If you should hear
That someone new
Has eased the pain
Of losing you

Don't you believe it
Not for a moment
Don't you believe it
Because it isn't true

Those angry words
That made us part
Put out the flame
That's in my heart

Don't you believe it
Not for a moment
Don't you believe it
Because it isn't true

I haven't changed
I still love you
And it will always be

I only hope and
I pray each night
You'll feel the
Same about me

So if you hear
Some false alarms
Like you're not welcome
In my arms

Don't you believe it
Not for a moment
Don't you believe it
Because it isn't true

Oh, how I still love you
