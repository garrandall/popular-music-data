Rockets, moon shots
Spend it on the have nots
Money, we make it
'Fore we see it you take it

Oh, make you wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
Way they do my life

This ain't livin', this ain't livin'
No, no, baby, this ain't livin'
No, no, no, no, no

Inflation, no chance
To increase the finance
Bills piled up sky high
Send that boy off to die

Oh, make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Oh, make me wanna holler
The way they do my life

Hang ups, let downs
Bad breaks, set backs
Natural fact is, honey that
I can't pay my taxes

Oh, make me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands
Yeah, it makes me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands

Crime is increasing
Trigger happy policing
Panic is spreading
God knows where we're heading

Oh, make me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands
Yeah, it makes me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands

Hang ups, let downs
Bad breaks, set backs
Natural fact is, honey that
I can't pay my taxes

Crime is increasing
Trigger happy policing
Panic is spreading
God knows where we're heading

Oh, make me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands
Yeah, make me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands

Make me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands
Make me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands

Rockets, moon shots
Spend it on the have nots
Money, we make it
'Fore we see it you take it

Oh, make you wanna holler
Throw up both my hands
Make me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands

Make me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands
Make me wanna holler
Throw up my hands

Make me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands
Make me wanna holler
Throw up my hands

Make me wanna holler
Throw up my hands
Make me wanna holler
Throw up my hands

Make me wanna holler, yeah
Make me wanna holler, yeah

Make me wanna holler
Throw up my hands
Make me wanna holler
Throw up my hands
Make me wanna holler
