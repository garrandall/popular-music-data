I've been feeling real good,
Came a long way from misunderstood.
Far away from the days where I wouldn't wanna go home,
'Cause I was afraid of the truth.

See I was scared to admit,
That failing was in the back of my head.
Comes a point when lying no longer works,
So you have to stand up for how you want to live.

Tonight is the night is the night,
That were losing control.
Tonight is the night is the night,
We set it off.

Everybody go
Wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
Wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Everybody go
Wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
Wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

And I don't know better,
But as far as I came it felt like forever.
Seconds turn to hours, days turn to months,
Another year pass by but don't feel like much.

So if I got one chance,
Motherfucker, I'm a make y'all dance.
I'm a have as much fun as I can,
And figure out the rest when I etch out a plan.

Tonight is the night is the night,
That were losing control.
Tonight is the night is the night,
We set it off.

Everybody go
Wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
Wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Everybody go
Wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
Wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I'm feelin' better than I ever thought,
It's possible but now I know.
I'm feelin' better than I ever did,
Impossible don't exist.

Impossible don't exist...

Everybody go
Wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
Wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Everybody go
Wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
Wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Tonight is the night is the night that were losing control
Tonight is the night is the night we set it off
Tonight is the night is the night that were losing control
Tonight is the night is the night we set it off
