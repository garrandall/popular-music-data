Hotter than the sun of south in Spain
Got me soon as I walked through the door
My pocket started tickling
The way she dropped it low that thang
Got me wanna spend my money on her, her

She get it pop it, lock it, drop it
That birthday cake
Got a candle, need to blow that crazy flame away
Now take my red, black card and my jewelry
Shawty is cool like the fire, cool like fire

Somebody call 911!

Whoa!
I gotta cool her down
She wan' bring the roof to ground on the dance floor
Whoa!

That little shawty's fire-burning on the dance floor
She's fire-burning, fire-burning on the dance floor

That body is a masterpiece
The order is one in every hundred years
But ain't no doubt I'm taking it home
I'm afraid we'll blow them legs
Little mama, game is about to change
She'll be on covers over the world, world

She get it pop it, lock it, drop it
That birthday cake
Got a candle need to blow that crazy flame away
Now take my red, black card and my jewelry
