I find myself in a strange situation
And I don't know how
What seemed to be an infatuation
Is so different now
I can't get by if we're not together
Oh can't you see
Girl, I want you now and forever
Close to me


I'm longing for the time
I'm longing for the day
Hoping that you will promise to be mine
And never go away


I don't want to live without you
I could never live without you
Live without your love


I ask myself but there's no explanation
For the way I feel
I know I've reached the right destination
And I know it's real


I'm longing for the time
I'm longing for the day
When I'll be giving you this heart of mine
Believe me when I say




Now I don't want to live without you
I don't want to live without you
I could never be without you
Be without your love
I don't want to live without you
Live without your love
You see I'm lost without your love


Oh...oh
Without your love
