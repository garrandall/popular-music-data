You've got that smile
That only heaven can make
I pray to God every day
That you keep that smile

You are my dream
There's not a thing that I won't do
I'll give my life up for you
'Cause you are my dream

And baby, everything that I have is yours
You will never go cold or hungry
I'll be there when you're insecure
Let you know that you're always lovely

Girl, you are the only thing that I got right now

One day
When the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you
Right next to you

Nothing will ever come between us
I'll be standing right next to you
Right next to you

If you had my child
You would make my life complete
Just to have your eyes on little me
That'd be mine forever

And baby, everything that I have is yours
You will never go cold or hungry
I'll be there when you're insecure
Let you know that you're always lovely

Girl, you are the only thing that I got right now

One day
When the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you
Right next to you

Nothing will ever come between us
I'll be standing right next to you
Right next to you

We were made for one another
Me and you
And I have no fear
I know we'll make it through

One day
When the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you
Right next to you

Oh, oh

One day
When the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you
Right next to you

Nothing will ever come between us
I'll be standing right next to you
Right next to you
Right next to you
