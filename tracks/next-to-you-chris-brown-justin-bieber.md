You've got that smile
That only heaven can make
I pray to God everyday
That you keep that smile

Yeah, you are my dream (You are my dream)
There's not a thing I won't do
I'll give my life up for you
'Cause you are my dream

And baby, everything that I have is yours
You will never go cold or hungry
I'll be there when you're insecure
Let you know that you're always lovely
Girl, 'cause you are the only thing that I got right now

One day when the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you
Right next to you
Nothing will ever come between us
'Cause I'll be standing right next to you
Right next to you

If you had my child (Yodel-lay-ah)
You would make my life complete (Yodel-lay-ah)
Just to have your eyes on little me
That'd be mine forever (Oh)

And baby, everything that I have is yours (Oh, everything)
You will never go cold or hungry (Oh)
I'll be there when you're insecure (Insecure)
Let you know that you're always lovely
Girl, 'cause you are the only thing that I got right now

One day when the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you
Right next to you (Whoa)
Nothing will ever come between us
I'll be standing right next to you
Right next to you

We're made for one another (One another)
Me and you (And you, and you, and you)
And I have no fear
I know we'll make it through

One day when the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

One day when the sky is falling (When the sky is falling)
I'll be standing right next to you (Right next to you, oh)
Right next to you (Right next to you, oh)
Nothing will ever come between us (Nothing will ever, between us)
I'll be standing right next to you
Right next to you (Right next to you)

Oh, nah, nah
Oh, yeah
Stand by my side, side, side
When the sky falls
I'll be there, I'll be there

You've got that smile
That only heaven can make
I pray to God everyday
To keep you forever
Oh-oh
