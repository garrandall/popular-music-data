Fats spoken: 'Ha-ha-ha, Let's go!'

Unks:
'Settle down, alright, alright'
'Settle down there, slow down'
'Can't wait'
'Have to all wait for the party'
'Then I want ya to slow down, ha-ha-ha)
'Just wait'
'Woo-woo!'

Song begins vocal, Fats Domino

Where was Jody, when the lights went out?
Standin' in the corner
Shout-shout sissy, shout

What a party
Lordy, Lordy!
(Big fat piano man
He sho' can (wail) wail away

What a party
Lordy, Lordy!
(Big fat piano man, he sho' could play-ay-ay)

The girl was dressed
Wit' no shoes on
(Ah, roll)
The big tenor man
Really blew his horn

What a party
Lordy, Lordy!
(Big fat piano man, he sho' could wail away)

What a party
Lordy, Lordy!
(Big fat piano man, he sho' could play-ay-ay)

Somebody called a cop
About half past four
(Quiet now, six feet four)
Laughter
He knew he just couldn't get
Through that do'

(One mo' time!)

What a party (Lordy!)
Lordy, Lordy!
(Big fat piano man, he sho' could wail away)
What a party
Lordy, Lordy!
(Big fat piano man, he sho' could play-ay-ay)

(instrumental, sax and chatter)

'Blow that thing, now! Hard!'

'One more for man Hardesty'

Take out

FADES-
