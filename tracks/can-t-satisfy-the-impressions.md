You know I can't satisfy your love, I can't satisfy
Seems I can't satisfy your love, I can't satisfy

Oh I found out in time what was on your mind
You never planned to stay, didn't love me anyway
One of the chosen few, did what you told me to
All you ever did was lie, I can't satisfy

Seems I can't satisfy your love, I can't satisfy

You seem so complete, so petite and sweet
But never do I know just which way you're gonna go
Sometimes I wonder why, why do you make me cry
Why do the love inside swallow up all of my pride

But I can't satisfy your love, I can't satisfy
No, no, no, no, no, I can't satisfy your love, I can't satisfy

(musical interlude)

You seem so complete, so petit and sweet
But never do I know just which way you're gonna go
Sometimes I wonder why, why do you make me cry

Why does the love inside swallow up all of my pride

When I can't satisfy your love, I can't satisfy, I can't, no, no, no
I can't satisfy your love, I can't satisfy

One of the chosen few, did what you told me to
All you ever did was lie, I can't satisfy

Seems I can't satisfy your love, I can't satisfy
No no no I can't satisfy your love, no I can't satisfy
