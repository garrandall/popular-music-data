Why do I cry why do I sigh when I know oh when I know deep down inside
What you told me was just another lie
Everyday I get the blues I get those bad kind of blues I just can't lose
What you told me was just another lie
I should know better by now I shouldn't trust you like I do
But when you wrote those great big lies you're just like an angel out of the blues
So why do I cry why do I sigh when I know when I know deep down inside
What you told me was just another lie

I should know better by now...
