I ain't got a type
Bad boyz, is the only boys that I like
Need em in my life
Attitude boss, like adidas they don't stress
I ain't fucking with no guy
Sexy Dons is the only Donners that I like
I'm just living life
Smoking till I fly, yea we do this every night

I like my boys bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
I like my boys bad, if I chat shit he get mad
Never no push over, never ever will he back
There for anybody who never had his back
Monoply, got the whole world on smash
Ain't topping me, scrapping skys
Yeah that's what I like, just trapping every night
Its just do or die, homocide
I told him, money ain't the only thing that's on my mind
Ride or die
My words don't lie, badboy I'm a hit like a good jean
Nigga come quick like a a track team
Belling me down like a crack fiend
Told me that them other bitches irritate him like fluorine
This mami... quantro...

I ain't got a type
Bad boyz, is the only boys that I like
Need em in my life
Attitude boss like a adidas they don't stress
I ain't fucking with no guy
Sexy Dons is the only Donners that I like
I'm just living life
Smoking till I fly, yea we do this every night

TT's wiv B.Ds on one
Big breasts but no sex, I'm a nun
That means f.u.c.k.s.I.d.o.n.t ever give none
B.I.G but I ain't pun
Got money like bees they all come
Now they wanna be with the d
But back in the day, they never want to put me on
See fuck with them like x-rays
They be going back n forth like the nay-nay
But its cool, cause mumma never raised no fool
Times up and I'm ending the play date
D.o - n.I.s.h, we know that I don't play
I say the right scene
 on your tongue like colgate

I ain't got a type
Bad boyz, is the only boys that I like
Need em in my life
Attitude boss like a adidas they don't stress
I ain't fucking with no guy
Sexy Dons is the only Donners that I like
I'm just living life
Smoking till I fly, yea we do this every night

Yea we do this every night, do this every night
Smoking till I fly, yea we do this every night
I get higher than the guys, yea we do this every night
Paint the city red yeah we do this every night
