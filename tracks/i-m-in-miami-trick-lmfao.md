When I step on the scene
Y'all know me
'Cause I walk with a limp
Like a old school pimp, like a real O.G
I'm rocking vans
I'm in the sand
I've a got a red bull and vodka up in my hand


Hey!
You look kind of cute
In that polka dot bikini, guuurl
Hey!
This what I wanna do (what)
Take off that polka dot bikini, guuuurl
Drink all day
Play all night
Let's get it poppin'
I'm in Miami trick
Drink all day
Play all night
Let's get it poppin'
I'm in Miami Trick

Everybody on smash (smash)
Hands in the air (air)
I'm feelin on her ass (ass)
Like a nigga don't care (like a nigga don't care)
I've gotta a plan
What's your cell
We playing naked twister back in my hotel


Hey!
You look kind of cute
In that polka dot bikini, guuurl
Hey!
This what I wanna do (what)
Take off that polka dot bikini, guuuurl
Drink all day
Play all night
Let's get it poppin'
I'm in Miami trick
Drink all day
Play all night
Let's get it poppin'
I'm in Miami Trick

Getch yo hands up
Put that ass up

Getch yo hands up
I'm in Miami trick
Put put that ass up
I'm in Miami trick
Getch yo getch yo getch yo getch yo hands up
Put that put that put that put that ass up
Getch yo getch yo getch yo getch yo hands up
Put that put that put that put that ass up
Getch yo getch getch yo hands

Oh, ohoohhohoh

It's mornin' time and the girls are still there
They lying naked with them asses in the air
Anna wants it bad she's got some big kahunas
But I say I'll be back gotta get some more coronas
Get your hands up
Put that ass up
Get your hands up
I'm in Miami trick
Put put that ass up
I'm in Miami trick
Get yo get yo get yo get yo hands up
Put that put that put that put that ass up
Get yo get yo get yo get yo hands up
Put that put that put that put that ass up
