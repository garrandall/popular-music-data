What now my love now that you've left me
How can I live through another day
Watching my dreams turning to ashes
And all my hopes into bits of clay

Once I could see, once I could feel
Now I am numb, I've become unreal
I walk the night without a goal
Stripped of my heart
Stripped of my soul

What now my love, now that it's over
I feel the world closing in on me
Here come the stars tumbling around me
There's the sky where the sea should be

What now my love, now that you've gone
I'd be a fool to go on and on
No one would care, no one would cry
If I should live, if I should die

What now my love
Now there is nothing
Only my last goodbye
Only my last goodbye
Only my last goodbye
Only my last goodbye
