What kind of fool, what kind of fool
What kind of fool do you think I am?
You think I can 
After we had made our plans
Said I'd be your number one man

What kind of fool do you think I am
Do you think I am, do you think I am?
What kind of fool do you think I'd be?
You said you really, really loved me

Darling, you run around all over town
You build me up then you let me down
What kind of fool do you think I am
What do you think I am?

I ain't gonna be your second choice
I've got to be your number one
Or I ain't gonna love you at all

Darling, you run around all over town
You build me up then you let me down
What kind of fool do you think I am
Do you think I am, baby?

Darling, you can't think that
Darling, I'm no fool
What kind of fool?
