You know I never
I never seen you look so good
You never act the way you should
But I like it
And I know you like it too
The way that I want you
I gotta have you
Oh yes, I do

I never
I never ever stay out late
You know that I can hardly wait
Just to see you
And I know you cannot wait
A' Wait to see me too
I gotta touch you


Cause baby we'll be
At the drive-in
In the old man's Ford
Behind the bushes
Till I'm screaming for more
Down the basement
Lock the cellar door
And baby
Talk dirty to me

You know I call you
I call you on the telephone
I'm only hoping that you're home
So I can hear you
When you say those words to me
And whisper so softly
I gotta hear you


Cause baby we'll be
At the drive-in
In the old man's Ford
Behind the bushes
Till I'm screaming for more
Down the basement
Lock the cellar door
And baby
Talk dirty to me

C.C. pick up that guitar and talk to me


Cause baby we'll be
At the drive-in
In the old man's Ford
Behind the bushes
Till I'm screaming for more
Down the basement
Lock the cellar door
And baby
Talk dirty to me


Cause baby we'll be
At the drive-in
In the old man's Ford
Behind the bushes
Till I'm screaming for more
Down the basement
Lock the cellar door
And baby
Talk dirty to me
