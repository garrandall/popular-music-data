You are my everything
You are my everything
You, my everything
Everything, everything, everything


It's all because of you, I'm never sad and blue
You've brightened up my days in your own special way
Whenever you're around, I'm never feeling down
You are my trusted friend, on you I can depend
You take me away from the pain and you bring me paradise
And when there were cloudy days you brought sunshine in my life
It never occurred to me the first time I saw your face
I would fall so deep in love that your love can't be replaced


You are my everything
Love so good only you can bring
You are my everything
You are everything and everything is you


My darling only you can make my dreams come true
And every night I pray, you'll never go away
I promise I will try until the day I die
To treat you like a king cause you are my everything
You take me away from the pain and you bring me paradise
And when there were cloudy days you brought sunshine in my life
It never occurred
I would fall so deep in love that your love can't be replaced




You are everything and everything is you
You are everything and everything is you
You are everything and everything is you
You are everything and everything is you


When you're lovin' me, put your lovin' arms around me
When you're lovin' me, said I feel so safe, I find security
When you're lovin' me, forever I want you to hold me
My everything, my every, every, every, everything



You are my everything
Love so good only you can bring
You are my everything
You are everything and everything is you


And I thank you, thank you, thank you
