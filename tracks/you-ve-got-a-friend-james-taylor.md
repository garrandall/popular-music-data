When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, whoa, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest nights

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running oh yeah baby
To see you again
Winter, spring, summer, or fall
All you got to do is call
And I'll be there, yeah, yeah yeah
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Should turn dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind
Should begin to blow
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud now
Soon I be knocking
Upon your door

You just call out my name
And you know where ever I am
I'll come running oh yes I will
To see you again
Winter, spring, summer, or fall yeah
All you got to do is call
And I'll be there, yeah yeah yeah

Hey, ain't it good to know
That you've got a friend?
People can be so cold
They'll hurt you
And desert you
Well, they'll take your soul
If you let them
Oh yeah, but don't you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running
To see you again, oh baby don't you know 'bout
Winter, spring, summer, or fall
Ain't now all you got to do is call
Lord, I'll be there, yes I will
You've got a friend

You've got a friend, yes
Ain't it good to know
You've got a friend
Ain't it good to know
You've got a friend
Oh yeah yeah
You've got a friend
