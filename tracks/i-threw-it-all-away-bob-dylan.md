I once held her
In my arms
She said she would
Always stay
But I was cruel
I treated her like a fool

I threw it all away

Once I had mountains
In the palm of my hand
And rivers that ran through
Every day
But I must have been mad
I never knew what I had

Until I threw it all away

Love is all there is
It makes the world go ’round
Love and only love
It can’t be denied
No matter what you think about it
You just won’t be able to do without it
Take a tip from one who’s tried

So if you find someone
Who gives you all of her love
Take it to your heart, don’t let it stray
For one thing for certain
You will surely be a-hurtin'

If you throw it all away
If you throw it all away
