If I had no more time
No more time left to be here
Would you cherish what we had?
Was I everything that you were looking for?
If I couldn't feel your touch
And no longer were you with me
I'd be wishing you were here
To be everything that I've been looking for


I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted
The time you may have here with me
'Cause Lord only knows another day here's not really guaranteed


So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me
Love me like you'll never see me again
Oh oh oh


How many really know what love is?
Millions never will
Do you know until you lose it?
That it's everything that we are looking for
When I wake up in the morning
And you're beside me
I'm so thankful that I found
Everything that I've been looking for


I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted
The time you may have here with me
'Cause Lord only knows another day here's not really guaranteed


So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me
Love me like you'll never see me again
So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
(Can you do that for me, baby?)
Every time you touch me
(See, we don't really know)
Touch me like this is the last time
(Say every day, we never know)
Promise that you'll love me
(I want you to run with me)
Love me like you'll never see me again
(Like you'll never see me again)


Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
