Lennon-McCartney

Late yesterday night
I saw a light shine from a window
And as I looked again
Your face came into sight
I couldn't walk on
Until you'd gone from your window
I had to make you mine
I knew you were the one

Oh, I would be glad just to have a love like that
Oh, I would be true and I'd spend my life with you

So meet me tonight
Just where the light shines from a window
And as I take your hand
Say that you'll be mine tonight
