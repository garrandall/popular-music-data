As I write this letter
Send my love to you
Remember that I'll always
Be in love with you


Treasure these few words 'til we're together
Keep all my love forever
P.S. I love you
You, you, you


I'll be coming home again to you, love
And 'til the day I do, love
P.S. I love you
You, you, you


As I write this letter
Send my love to you
Remember that I'll always
Be in love with you


Treasure these few words 'til we're together
Keep all my love forever
P.S. I love you
You, you, you


As I write this letter (oh)
Send my love to you
(You know I want you to)
Remember that I'll always (yeah)
Be in love with you


I'll be coming home again to you, love
And 'til the day I do, love
P.S. I love you
You, you, you


You, you, you
I love you
