She came in like a hurricane
Wearing boots and diamond rings
And with a fox fur on her shoulder
She set me wondering

Well, I could tell
She was feeling abandoned
Because she dropped her cup
And looked my way

And she said, hey
You never asked me
So I'll tell you anyway


She took me out
In the blackboard jungle
Put me straight in a hurricane
She hypnotized my eyes
With her silver heeled ways
If I could sing like Paul McCartney
Or get funky like Etta James
I'd never change, I'd never change
I'd never change her silver heeled ways

Silver, silver heels
Silver, silver heels

She came in and her flags were flying
She was a sailboat of sweet perfume
And I could see that her eyes were
Smiling from across the room

Well, I couldn't think of conversation
I was busy looking at her fur
She said, hey, you'll never ask me
So I guess I'll say the word



Silver, silver heels
Silver, silver heels
Whoa, whoa
Silver, silver heels
Silver, silver heels



Silver, silver heels
Silver, silver heels
Whoa, whoa
Silver, silver heels
Silver, silver heels
