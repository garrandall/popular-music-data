I read your mind like an open book
You lost the fire in your eyes
You turn to me with a different look
And then it's raining, looks like it's raining


Oh no, tears are falling


Something is wrong as I hold you near
Somebody else holds your heart, yeah
You look at me with your eyes in tears
And then it's raining, feels like it's raining


Oh no, tears are falling
Oh no, tears are falling, whoo oh
I saw you cry


And now it's raining (yeah)
Looks like it's raining (someone stole your heart)
And now it's raining, feels like it's raining


Oh no, tears are falling
Oh no, tears are falling, whoo oh
Oh no, tears are falling, someone stole your heart
Oh no, tears are falling, they're falling from your eyes
Oh no, tears are falling, (no no, falling from your eyes)
Oh no, tears are falling
(Oh no, no, falling, oh, they're falling from your eyes)
Oh no, tears are falling (Oh no, no, falling from your eyes)
Oh no, tears are falling
