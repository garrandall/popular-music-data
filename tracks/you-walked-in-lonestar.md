Everybody's talkin' 'bout the supermodel world
Cindy, Naomi and that whole bunch of girls
Redheads, brunettes and blondes with blue eyes
They come in every shape yea they come in every size
You know I love everything they do
I check 'em out on every Pay-Per-View
Oh, but honey that was way before I met you.
And then

You walked in with legs up to your neck
You walked in I'm a physical wreck
You walked in I've lost my cool babe
But what'd you expect
When you walk in baby love begins
When you walk by baby oh my my
When you come around, my jaw hits the ground
When you shake your thing I jump outta my skin
When you cross the floor I scream "more baby more"
When you flash your smile you drive me wild
Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea

Everybody's checkin' out the glossy magazines
Madonna, Diana, you know the whole scene
The covergirls, the centerfolds and every movie star
And all those pretty ladies down there at the local bar
I couldn't think of nothin' better to do
Than checkin' out a little wiggle or two
Oh, but honey that was way before I met you
And then

You walked in with legs up to your neck
You walked in I'm a physical wreck
You walked in I've lost my cool babe
But what the heck
When you walk in baby love begins
When you walk by baby oh my my
When you come around, my jaw hits the ground
When you shake your thing I jump outta my skin
When you cross the floor I scream "more baby more"
When you flash your smile you drive me wild
Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea

I couldn't think of nothin' better to do
Than checkin' out a little wiggle or two
But honey that was way before I met you

When you walk in baby love begins
When you walk by baby oh my my
When you come around, my jaw hits the ground
When you shake your thing I jump outta my skin
When you cross the floor I scream "more baby more"
When you flash your smile you drive me wild
Now you drive me wild

When you walk in baby love begins
When you walk by baby oh my my
When you come around, my jaw hits the ground
When you shake your thing I jump outta my skin
When you cross the floor I scream "more baby more"
