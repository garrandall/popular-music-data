Here we go here we go as the tune starts to bloom
With a phat phat phat chorus
1-2-3 if this is O.G
The freaks would ya move ya booties
The getto jam is about to slam
With some notes from the diggady D-E
As I key what's really goin on
Would ya reminisce with me-e


Saturday mornin' just gettin up
With a hangover smellin' like I fucked
I really can't remember cause I'm still kinda faded
So I close my eyes and thank God that I made it
Now I'm gettin flashbacks of some O.J
With a green glass, says Tanqueray
Took it to the head, gulped it down with the quickness
Now I need a bitch so I can handle my business
What do you know, a freak's in my reach
Threw her on the flo', stuck it in her deep
She's screamin and she's screamin and she's screamin, gettin hoarse
But then I busted a nut, and that was that
So kick the chorus

My homies are down, chillin' in the hood
But them hood bitches, well they ain't no good
To another man well she might be some good cat
But homies in the hood label her as a hood rat
She's scandalous
So those with game can fuck
And oh she'll clown your ass real fast, if you're quick to nut
And when you're in that thi-ing
She'll make a nigga si-ng
Duh-du-dway, duh-dum-dway, duh-dum-dway
But you don't hear me doe
Ain't nuthin wrong with being a Trojan man, when ya ridin
So let's kick the chorus please if ya like it

My homie's clownin' in his dope, yellow chevy
Too O.D.'ed to be dropped
Kenwood's kickin that funk in the trunk
Clean with the rag on top, yeah
Rollin down the 'Shaw, guess what we saw, some bitches
The finest one is on my nuts, she's blowing kisses
So I approached the freak of the week
And I played it like a game of blackjack
And for all that ass that she toted around
Well I offered a backpack
And since I'm a mack
Well you know how the story goes
So all ya hoes and their bros here we go
