Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody has those days

One, two, three, four

Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody has those days (Oh yeah)
Everybody knows what, what I'm talkin 'bout
Everybody gets that way
Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody has those days
Everybody knows what, what I'm talkin 'bout
Everybody gets that way, yeah!

Sometimes I'm in a jam
I've gotta make a plan
It might be crazy
I do it anyway
No way to know for sure
I figure out a cure
I'm patchin' up the holes
But then it overflows

If I'm not doin' too well
Why be so hard on myself?

Nobody's perfect
I gotta work it
Again and again
'Til I get it right
Nobody's perfect
You live and you learn it
And if I mess it up sometimes
Nobody's perfect

Sometimes I work a scheme
But then it flips on me
Doesn't turn out how I planned
Gets stuck in quicksand
But no problem can't be solved
Once I get involved
I try to be delicate
Then crash right into it

But my intentions are good, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sometimes just misunderstood

Nobody's perfect
I gotta work it
Again and again
'Til I get it right

Nobody's perfect
You live and you learn it
And if I mess it up sometimes
Nobody's perfect
I gotta work it
I know in time I'll find a way
Nobody's perfect

Sometimes I fix things up
And they fall apart again
Nobody's perfect
I might mix things up
But I always get it right in the end
You know I do

Next time you feel like
It's just one of those days
When you just can't seem to win
If things don't turn out the way you planned
Figure something else out
Don't stay down
Try again
Yeah!

Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody has those days (that's right!)
Everybody knows what, what I'm talkin 'bout
Everybody gets that way
Everybody makes mistakes (here we go!)
Everybody has those days (uh huh)
Everybody knows what, what I'm talkin 'bout
Everybody gets that way

Nobody's perfect
I gotta work it
Again and again
'Til I get it right
Nobody's perfect
You live and you learn it
And if I mess it up sometimes
Nobody's perfect
I gotta work it
I know in time I'll find a way
Nobody's perfect
You live and you learn it
'Cause everybody makes mistakes
Nobody's perfect (Nobody's perfect)
No, no
Nobody's perfect
