Come to send. Not condescend
Transcendent to consequences
To transcend where we are
Who are we? Who we are


Trampled moss on your souls
Changes, all you're a part
Seen it all. Not at all
Can't defend fucked up men


Take me for a ride before we leave


Circumstance. Clapping hands
A driving winds. Happenstance
Off the track, in the mud
That's the moss in the aforementioned verse


And a little... Wow... And a little...
Just a little time before we leave


Stop light plays its part
So I would say you've got a part
What's your part? Who you are
You are who who you are
