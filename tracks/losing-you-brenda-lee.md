Don't sigh a sigh for me
Don't ever cry for me
This is goodbye for me
I know we're through
I'm Losing you

Love sang it's song for me
Then things went wrong for me
Nights are too long for me
Because I'm losing you

Our love and our devotion
Were deep as any ocean
Then one day like the tide you began to change
And you became a perfect stranger

Someone is holding you
Sharing the lips I knew
I can't believe it's true
That I am losing you

I can't believe it's true
That I am losing you
