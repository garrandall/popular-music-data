Girl, try to remember
When we didn't have no shoes
We stuck together, just me and you
It took a long time, to get what we got today
Now ya wanna give it all up for another guy

Baby, I'm tellin' ya
Don't let the green grass fool ya
Don't let it change your mind

It's gonna be hard for me, baby
Build my life all over
Because baby, you got the love
That I really need, really

'Cause if you leave
Leave me this way, baby
You know what?
I may not live to see a brand new day

Oh baby
Don't let the green grass fool ya
Don't let it change your mind
You know why?
It may be greener on the other side, baby
But right in my arms is where you belong

Umm, mmm
Ooo-oo, baby
Oh-oh

Don't let the green grass fool ya
Don't let it change your mind, oh baby
It may be greener on the other side, baby
But oh right in my arms is where you belong, baby
Gotta feel it

Don't let the green grass fool ya, baby
(Don't let it change your mind)
Ah-hey (greener on the other side)
Don't, don't let it fool ya
Baby, in my arms is where you belong, yeah
