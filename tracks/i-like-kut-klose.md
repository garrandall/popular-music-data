Tender loving
It's one on one
Don't wanna rush it, nah
Let's take it nice and slow, honey
Caress my body
And hold me tight
Don't let me go, baby
Until I get enough, oooh


(Baby tonight) baby tonight
(The loving is right) the loving is right
(You know how I like it)
You know how I like it, yeah
(You know how I want it)
You know just what I want, baby


I like the way you tease me
I like the way you squeeze me
I like the way you touch me
I like the way you sex me


Turn down the lights, baby
Take off what you have on
Let's do it to the music
Come bring your loving on
My body's yearning for you, baby
For a taste of your love
Only you can fill this appetite
Come on and satisfy my love


(Baby tonight) baby tonight
(The loving is right) the loving is right
(You know how I like it)
You know how I like it
(You know how I want it)
You know how I want it


I like the way you tease me
I like the way you squeeze me
I like the way you touch me
I like the way you sex me
I like the way you tease me
I like the way you squeeze me
I like the way you touch me
I like the way you sex me


Baby, don't you hold back on me
(Can't nobody do it like you do it)
Give me everything you've got
I wanna give you all my loving
It will be good to the last drop
Baby, don't you hold back on me
Give me everything you've got
I wanna give you all my loving
It will be good to the last drop


I like the way you tease me
I like the way you squeeze me
I like the way you touch me
I like the way you sex me
I like the way you tease me
I like the way you squeeze me
I like the way you touch me
I like the way you sex me
I like the way you tease me
I like the way you squeeze me
I like the way you touch me
I like the way you sex me
