Oh, well, imagine
As I'm pacing the pews in a church corridor
And I can't help but to hear
No, I can't help but to hear an exchanging of words
"What a beautiful wedding!
What a beautiful wedding!”, says a bridesmaid to a waiter
"And yes, but what a shame, what a shame
The poor groom's bride is a whore"


I chime in with a "Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality
I chime in, "Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of...


Oh, well in fact
Well, I'll look at it this way, I mean technically our
Marriage is saved, well this calls for a toast
So pour the champagne
Oh! Well in fact
Well, I'll look at it this way, I mean technically our
Marriage is saved, well this calls for a toast
So pour the champagne, pour the champagne


I chime in with a "Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality
I chime in, "Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality, again


I chime in "Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality
I chime in, "Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality, again
