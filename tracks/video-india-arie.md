Mmm, mmm, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah


Sometimes I shave my legs and sometimes I don't
Sometimes I comb my hair and sometimes I won't
Depend on how the wind blows, I might even paint my toes
It really just depends on whatever feels good in my soul (Oh, oh, oh)


I'm not the average girl from your video (Oh)
And I ain't built like a supermodel (Oh)
But I learned to love myself unconditionally
Because I am a queen
I not the average girl from your video
My worth is not determined by the price of my clothes
No matter what I'm wearing I will always be
India.Arie


When I look in the mirror and the only one there is me
Every freckle on my face is where it's supposed to be, yeah (Haha)
And I know my creator didn't make no mistakes on me
My feet, my thighs, my lips, my eyes, I'm loving what I see (Yeah)


I'm not the average girl from your video (Oh)
And I ain't built like a supermodel (Oh)
But I learned to love myself unconditionally
Because I am a queen (Yeah)
I not the average girl from your video (Oh)
My worth is not determined by the price of my clothes (Oh)
No matter what I'm wearing I will always be
India.Arie


Am I less of a lady if I don't wear pantyhose?
My momma said a lady ain't what she wears but what she knows
But I've drawn the conclusion, it's all an illusion
Confusion's the name of the game
A misconception, a vast deception
Something's got to change
Now don't be offended, this is all my opinion
Ain't nothing that I'm saying law
This is a true confession of a life learned lesson
I was sent here to share with y'all
So get in when you fit in, go on and shine
Clear your mind, now's the time
Put your salt on the shelf
Go on and love yourself (Go on and love yourself, go on and love yourself)
â€˜Cause everything's gonna be alright


I'm not the average girl from your video (Oh)
And I ain't built like a supermodel (Yeah)
But I learned to love myself unconditionally
Because I am a queen
I not the average girl from your video
My worth is not determined by the price of my clothes
No matter what I'm wearing I will always be
India.Arie


Uh, keep your fancy drinks, and your expensive minks
I don't need that to have a good time
Keep your expensive cars and your caviar
All I need is my guitar
Keep your Cristal and your pistol
I'd rather have a pretty piece of crystal
Don't need your silicone, I prefer my own
What God gave me is just fine (Oh)


I'm not the average girl from your video (Yeah)
And I ain't built like a supermodel
But I learned to love myself unconditionally
Because I am a queen
I not the average girl from your video
My worth is not determined by the price of my clothes
No matter what I'm wearing I will always be
India.Arie
I'm not the average girl from your video (Yeah)
And I ain't built like a supermodel
But I learned to love myself unconditionally
Because I am a queen
I not the average girl from your video
My worth is not determined by the price of my clothes
No matter what I'm wearing I will always be
India.Arie
