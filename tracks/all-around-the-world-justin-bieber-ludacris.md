You're beautiful, beautiful, you should know it
(You're beautiful, beautiful, you should know it)
I think it's time, think it's time that you show it
You're beautiful, beautiful

Go go go

Baby what you doin', where you at, where you at?
Why you actin' so shy holdin' back, holdin' back?
We're not the only ones doin' it like that, it like that
So DJ bring that, bring that, bring that, bring that back

'Cuz all around the world people want to be loved (yeah)
'Cuz all around the world they're no different than us (no)
All around the world people want to be loved
All around the world they're no different than us
All around the world
All around the world

You're crazy girl, crazy girl, you should know it
(You're crazy girl, crazy girl, don't control it)
Light it up, light it up, so explosive
You're crazy girl (yeah yeah)

Baby what you doin', where you at, where you at?
Why you actin' so shy holdin' back, holdin' back?
We're not the only ones doin' it like that, it like that
So DJ bring that, bring that, bring that, bring that back

All around the world people want to be loved (yeah)
All around the world they're no different than us (no)
All around the world people want to be loved
All around the world they're no different than us
All around the world


Yeah
Okay
Once again
(All around the world)
The dynamic duo is back at it
JB, Luda!
I love everything about you, you're imperfectly perfect
Everyone's itching for beauty, but just scratchin' the surface
Lost time is never found, can the DJ please reverse it?
In life we pay for change, let's make every second worth it
Anything can work if you work it when people say you don't deserve it
Then don't give in, 'cuz hate may win some battles, but love wins in the end
You shine just like the sun while the moon and the stars reflect your light
Beauty revolves around you
It's only right that...


All around the world people want to be loved
All around the world they're no different than us
All around the world (all around the world people wanna be loved)
All around the world (all around the world they're no different than us)
All around the world (all around the world people wanna be loved)
All around the world (all around the world they're no different than us)
All around the world
