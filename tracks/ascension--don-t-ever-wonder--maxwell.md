It happened the moment, when you were revealed
Cause you were a dream that you should not have been
A fantasy real
You gave me this beating baby
This rhythm inside
And you made me feel good and feel nice and feel loved
Give me paradise


So shouldn't I realize
You're the highest of the high
If you don't know, then I'll say it
So don't ever wonder (don't ever wonder)
So shouldn't I realize (shouldn't I realize)
You're the highest of the high
If you don't know, then I'll say it
So don't ever wonder


So tell me how long
How long it's gonna take until you speak, babe
Cause I can't live my life
Without you here by my side
You gave me the feelin', feelin' in my life


So shouldn't I realize
You're the highest of the high
If you don't know, then I'll say it
So don't ever wonder wonder (don't ever wonder wonder)
Shouldn't I realize shouldn't I realize
You're the highest of the high
You're the highest of the high
If you don't know, then I'll say it
So don't ever wonder wonder
So don't ever wonder wonder
Shouldn't I realize
You're the highest of the high
If you don't know, then I'll say it
So don't ever wonder wonder (don't ever don't ever wonder)
(don't ever wonder)
(don't ever wonder)
(don't ever wonder)
Never wished that
(don't ever wonder)
(without you, don't ever wonder)
(don't ever wonder)
(can't you see don't ever wonder)
(can't you see don't ever wonder)
