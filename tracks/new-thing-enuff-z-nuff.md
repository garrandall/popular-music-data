Information came about her
Suddenly I live without her
Turn my stereo up louder
I don't want to hear about her
Took myself a small vacation
Kind of on investigation
Checking out a new sensation
Finding much invigoration
Hand is on the buzzer
And I'm walking through the door

Get high on a new thing
Get high on a new thing
Get high, high on a new thing

Everybody wants to find it
Just they're all so narrow-minded
See a hill, they've got to climb it
May be pots of gold behind it
Worry, worry is your answer
If you like your wrinkles faster
Nursing old things make them last
The way we did it in the past
With everybody telling you
"You ain't got no respect!"

Repeat Chorus
