I had enough
Of body style
Wearing clothes
And wiping my nose
I give him chills
I give him medication
I just want to feel every sensation

I'm feelin' clean
My experience machine
It takes so much time
To wind and unwind

From time to time
I lose my mind
I don't want nobody
I get so bored
I want to cut the cord
I don't want no one

Don't want no body
Don't want no body
I don't want no body
I don't want no body
I don't want no
I don't want no
I don't want no
I don't want no body
I don't want no
I don't want no
I don't want no
I don't want no body

There's got to be a fine fine line
Between living and dying
I'm using my body up
I can't deny it
I got to find that fine fine line
I've got to know the difference between walking and flying
To close to the sun to hide and feel
I've got to know the difference between living and dying

I don't want no body
I don't want no body
Don't want no body
Don't want no body
I don't want no
I don't want no
I don't want no
I don't want no body
I don't want no
I don't want no
I don't want no

Where's that energy coming from
What kind of pain would pay for my fun
Part of me is leaving
Leaving the bag
But part of me is dying
Dying to get high

I lift my hand
To shade my eyes
In my room
There's a surprise
But where's that energy coming from
What kind of pain would pay for my fun
Part of me is leaving
Leaving the bag
But part of me is dying
Dying to get high

Don't want no body
I don't want no body
I don't want no body
Don't want no body
Don't want no
Don't want no
Don't want no body
Don't want no
Don't want no
I Don't want no body
