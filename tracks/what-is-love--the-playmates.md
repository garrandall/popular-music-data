Sways with a wiggle, with a wiggle when she walks
Sways with a wiggle when she walks
Sways with a wiggle, with a wiggle when she walks
Sways with a wiggle when she walks
What is love? Five feet of heaven in a ponytail
The cutest ponytail that sways with a wiggle when she walks
What is love? Five feet of heaven and the bluest eyes
And what a pretty smile that shows you a dimple when she talks
What is love but a little angel who's makin' me lose my sleep?
And she's always makin' promises that she says she'll keep
What is love? Five feet of heaven in a ponytail
The cutest ponytail that sways with a wiggle when she walks
Brief instrumental interlude
Shows you a dimple, yes a dimple when she talks
Shows you a dimple when she talks
Shows you a dimple, yes a dimple when she talks
Shows you a dimple when she talks
What is love but a little angel who's making me lose my sleep?
And she's always breakin' promises that she says she'll keep
What is love? Five feet of heaven in a ponytail
The cutest ponytail that sways with a wiggle when she walks
The cutest ponytail that sways with a wiggle when she walks
Sways with a wiggle, with a wiggle when she walks
Sways with a wiggle when she walks
FADE
Sways with a wiggle, with a wiggle when she walks
Sways with a wiggle when she walks
