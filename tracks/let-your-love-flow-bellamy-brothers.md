There's a reason for the sun-shining sky
And there's a reason why I'm feeling so high
Must be the season when that
Love light shines all around us


So, let that feeling grab you deep inside
And send you reeling where your love can't hide
And then go stealing
Through the moonlit nights with your lover


Just let your love flow
Like a mountain stream
And let your love grow
With the smallest of dreams
And let your love show
And you'll know what I mean
It's the season
Let your love fly
Like a bird on a wing
And let your love bind you
To all living things
And let your love shine
And you'll know what I mean
That's the reason


There's a reason for the warm sweet nights
And there's a reason for the candlelights
Must be the season when those
Love lights shine all around us


So, let that wonder take you into space
And lay you under its loving embrace
Just feel the thunder as it warms your face
You can't hold back


Just let your love flow
Like a mountain stream
And let your love grow
With the smallest of dreams
And let your love show
And you'll know what I mean
It's the season
Let your love fly
Like a bird on a wing
And let your love bind you
To all living things
And let your love shine
And you'll know what I mean
That's the reason


Just let your love flow
Like a mountain stream
And let your love grow
With the smallest of dreams
And let your love show
And you'll know what I mean
It's the season
Let your love fly
Like a bird on a wing
And let your love bind you
To all living things
And let your love shine
And you'll know what I mean
That's the reason


Just let your love flow
Like a mountain stream
And let your love grow
