All my girls at the party
Look at that body
Shakin' that thing
Like you never did see
Got a nice package alright
Guess I'm gonna have to ride it tonight
All my girls at the party
Look at that body
Shakin' that thing
Like you never did see
Got a nice package all right


Edit, 4, 3, 2, 1


It's all for you
If you really want it
It's all for you
If you say you need it
It's all for you
If you gotta have it
It's all for you if you make a move
It's all for you


I see you staring out the corner of my eye
You seem uneasy want to approach me
Throw me a line
But then something inside you grabs you says, who am I?
I know exactly cause it happens with all the guys


So you do what you gonna do
Come on and talk to me
Promise you won't even have an attitude
I'll let you sit right next to me
Don't join the list with these other fools
That ain't the way to be
Yes, it's cool
Yes, I'm in the mood
Intimidations got that mind


It's all for you
If you really want it
It's all for you
If you say you need it
It's all for you
If you gotta have it
It's all for you if you make a move
It's all for you
Tell me I'm the only one
It's all for you
Soon we'll be having fun
It's all for you
Come over here and get some
It's all for you if you make a move
It's all for you


Can't be afraid or keep me waiting for too long
Before you know it, I'll be outta here, I'll be gone
Don't try to be all clever, cute, or even sly
Don't have to work that hard
Just be yourself and let that be your guide


So you do what you gonna do
Come on and talk to me by
Promise you won't even have an attitude
I'll let you sit right next to me
Don't join the list with these other fools
That ain't the way to be boy
Yes, it's cool
Yes, I'm in the mood
Intimidations got that mind


It's all for you
If you really want it
It's all for you
If you say you need it
It's all for you
If you gotta have it
It's all for you if you make a move
It's all for you
It's all for you
Tell me you're the only one
It's all for you
Soon we'll be having fun
It's all for you
Come over here and get some
It's all for you if you make a move
It's all for you


All my girls at the party
