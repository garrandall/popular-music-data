Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me and then

Spin me around till I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me
And I knew for sure
I was loved

If I could get another chance
Another walk, another dance with him
Iâd play a song that would never, ever end
How Iâd love, love, love to dance with my father again

Ooh, ooh

When I and my mother would disagree
To get my way I would run from her to him
Heâd make me laugh just to comfort me, yeah, yeah
Then finally make me do just what my mama said

Later that night when I was asleep
He left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he
Would be gone from me

If I could steal one final glance
One final step, one final dance with him
Iâd play a song that would never, ever end
âCause Iâd love, love, love to dance with my father again

Sometimes Iâd listen outside her door
And Iâd hear her, mama cryinâ for him
I pray for her even more than me
I pray for her even more than me

I know Iâm prayinâ for much too much
But could You send back the only man she loved
I know You donât do it usually
But Lord, sheâs dyinâ to dance with my father again
Every night I fall asleep
And this is all I ever dream
