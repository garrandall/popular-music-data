You say we're falling out of love
You say we're running out of things to say
Don't you think we've had enough
Letting useless words get in the way
Can't you see what's going on
We're bringing problems where
They don't belong.

There's no way to work it out
When there's always something
We can turn this love around but
There's always something.

Stop and think and realize
We got something here that's really good
And maybe all we gotta do
Is believe in us the way we should
Without questions, without doubts
Live and learn babe that's what love's about.

There's no way to work it out when
There's always something
We can turn this love around but
There's always something
Starting here and starting 

Now we can work together
But we haven't got a prayer when
There's  always something.

Always agonizing, never compromising
Always finding something wrong
Stop and think and look around you
Since the day I found you
There's been something wrong.

There's no way to work it out when
There's always something
We can turn this love around but
Starting here and starting
Now we can work together
But we haven't got a prayer when
There's always something.
