She knew what she wanted
I knew what I wanted too
When I met her
I gave what she needed
She gave what I needed too
And I let her
I was too happy to notice that
She needed more than to hold me
Now she is holding somebody
That she knew before and she told me
Goodbye, baby, bye bye
Goodbye, baby, bye bye
Goodbye, baby, bye bye, bye bye
I should have known I'd be here
All alone, trying hard to forget her
Last time I saw her, she smiled and
She hoped I was feeling much better
She said, I don't want to see you cry
I don't want to see you cry
I don't want to see you cry
Wish I hadn't learned so much about her
Better off if I could live without her
Better off if I could live without her
Better off if I could live without her
Better off if I could live without her
Goodbye, baby, bye bye
(I don't want to see you cry)
Goodbye, baby, bye bye
(I don't want to see you cry)
Goodbye, baby, bye bye, bye bye
(I don't want to see you cry)
Goodbye, baby, bye bye
(I don't want to see you cry)
Goodbye, baby, bye bye...
