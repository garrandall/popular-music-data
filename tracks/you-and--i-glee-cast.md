Shelby:
It's been a long time since I came around
It's been a long time, but I'm back in town
This time I'm not leaving without you

Will:
Ooh, just you and I
Sharing our love together
And I know in time
We'll build the dreams we treasure
We'll be all right, just you and I

Shelby & Will:
Something, something about this place (Just you and, just you and I)
Something 'bout lonely nights (Lonely nights)
And my lipstick on your face (Just you and I)
Something, something about my cool Nebraska guy (Something about)
Yeah, something about
Baby, you and I

Just you and I
Sharing our love together
And I know in time
We'll build the dreams we treasure
And we'll be all right
Just you and I

Something, something about this place (Just you and, just you and I)
Something 'bout lonely nights (Lonely nights)
And my lipstick on your face (Just you and I)
Something, something about my cool Nebraska guy (I love you, you and I)
Yeah, something about
Baby, you and I

Oh, you and I
Remember our first embrace
That smile that was on your face
The promises that we made
Ooh, and now your love is my reward
And I love you even more
Than I ever did before

Something, something about this place (Just you and, just you and I)
Something 'bout lonely nights (Lonely nights)
And my lipstick on your face (Just you and I)
Something, something about my cool Nebraska guy (I love you, you and I)
Put your drinks up, for Nebraska
For Nebraska, Nebraska, I love you
You and I
You, you and I
Nebraska, I'd rather die
Without you and I
We made it, you and I
