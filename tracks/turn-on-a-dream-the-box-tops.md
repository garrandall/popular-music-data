We're too far away from each other
We got to get together
Because all I want to do is think about you
Don't you know there's no other?

Just turn on a dream, girl
That's all I wanna do is dream, girl
Just think about you and me, yeah, and how it could be
Why can't you see?

What can I do?
You won't let me show you
Don't you know that I know you?
When I'm down and my daytime's blue, I get by thinking of you

Just turn on a dream, girl
That's all I wanna do is dream, girl
Just think about you and me, yeah, and how it could be
Why can't you see?

I close my eyes… I can see
I can feel… that it's real
I can turn out the sad, turn on the glad

Shifting sand like an hourglass
Waiting for the time to pass
But I'll keep waiting like I always do
Dreaming sunny dreams of you

Just turn on a dream, girl
That's all I wanna do is dream, girl
Just think about you and me, yeah, and how it could be
Why can't you see?

Yeah
