Ah
Surrender me a kiss

Let me loose on you inch by inch

The one and only reason is fun, fun, fun
I said "Well baby, we've only just begun"
So don't talk Just kiss

We're beyond words and sound
Don't talk just kiss

Let your tongue fool around
Let's fool around

Oh yeah
There's people, there's love
You and I both apply to the above

The one and only reason is fun, fun, fun
I said "Well baby, we've only just begun"
So don't talk Just kiss

We're beyond words and sound
Don't talk just kiss

Let your tongue fool around

Ah ha
We're wasting precious time

Don't talk
Kiss
Ah
And make it mine

The one and only reason is fun, fun, fun
I said "Well baby, we've only just begun"
So don't talk Just kiss

We're beyond words and sound
Don't talk just kiss

Let your tongue fool around

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Fool around
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Fool around
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Fool around
(Surrender your love to me!)

So don't talk just kiss
We're beyond words and sound
Don't talk just kiss
Let your tongue fool around

We're beyond words and sound
Don't talk just kiss
Let your tongue fool around

Let's fool around
Let's fool around
