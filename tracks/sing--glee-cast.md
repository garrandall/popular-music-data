Sing it out
Boy, you've got to see what tomorrow brings


Sing it out
Girl, you've got to be what tomorrow needs


For every time that they want to count you out


And use your voice


Uhhh
Every single time


You open up your mouth


Sing it for the boys
Sing it for the girls; Every time that you lose it sing it for the world
Sing it from the heart
Sing it 'til you're nuts
Sing it out for the ones that'll hate your guts
Sing it for the deaf
Sing it for the blind
Sing about everyone that you left behind
Sing it for the world, sing it for the world


Ah


Sing it out!


Boy they're gonna sell what tomorrow means


Oohuh


Sing it out!


Boy before they kill what tomorrow brings


You've got to, make a choice if the music drowns you out


Music drowns you out
And raise your voice every single time
They


Try and shut your mouth


Sing it for the boys
Sing it for the girls; every time that you lose it sing it for the world
Sing it from the heart
Sing it 'til you're nuts
Sing it out for the ones that'll hate your guts
Sing it for the deaf
Sing it for the blind
Sing about everyone that you left behind
Sing it for the world, sing it for the world


Hooo-ho


Cleaned-up, corporation progress
Dying in the process
Children that can talk about it
Living on the webways
People moving sideways
Sell it ‘til your last days
Buy yourself the motivation
Generation nothing, nothing but a dead scene
Product of a white dream
I am not the singer that you wanted, but a dancer
I refuse to answer, talk about the past, sir
Wrote it for the ones who want to get away


Keep running!


Sing it for the boys
Sing it for the girls; every time that you lose it sing it for the world
Sing it from the heart
Sing it 'til you're nuts
Sing it out for the ones that'll hate your guts
Sing it for the deaf
Sing it for the blind
Sing about everyone that you left behind
Sing it for the world, sing it for the world


We’ve got to see what tomorrow brings


Sing it for the world
Sing it for the world


Boy you've got to be what tomorrow needs


Sing it for the world
Sing it for the world
