I want you to love me like I'm a hot ride (Uh, yeah)
Be thinking of me
Doing what you like
So boy, forget about the world
'Cause it's gon' be me and you tonight (Yeah)
I wanna make you beg for it
Then I'ma make you swallow your pride, oh


Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that's in command
'Cause I'm the only one who understands
How to make you feel like a man, yeah
Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only one


Want you to take it like a thief in the night
Hold me like a pillow
Make me feel right (Feel right)
Baby, I'll tell you all my secrets that I'm keeping
You can come inside (Yeah)
And when you enter, you ain't leaving
Be my prisoner for the night, oh


Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that's in command
'Cause I'm the only one who understands
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only one


Take me for a ride, ride
Oh, baby, take me high, high
Let me make you rise, rise
Oh, make it last all night, night
Take me for a ride, ride
Oh, baby, take me high, high
Let me make you rise, rise
Make it last all night


Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that's in command
'Cause I'm the only one who understands
How to make you feel like a man
Only girl in the world
Girl in the world
Only girl in the world
Girl in the world
