You can see her walking down on a city street, 
The American Girl 
She's got the passion in her eyes 
She's got the blush on her cheeks, 
The American Girl

I love to watch her move, her body sways 
She whispers then she laughs 
Did you hear what she says 
I wanna know if she's talking 'bout me 
Doing things her daddy can't see

The American Girl, out in the dark 
She's looking for love, oh oh 
The American Girl, she breaks hearts 
But that's not enough 
She's such a mystery to me

Love is full of intrigue 
And full of Bogart mystique, The American Girl
She's got the promise in the night 
The romance in the back seat, The American Girl

I love to watch her move, her body sways 
She whispers then she laughs 
Did you hear what she says 
I wanna know if she's talking 'bout me 
Doing things her daddy can't see

The American Girl, out in the dark 
She's looking for love, oh oh 
The American Girl, she breaks hearts 
But that's not enough 
She's such a mystery to me

And she stares at herself 
In the harsh white light 
And she draws in her cheeks 
Just like the model 
So unsure of herself in the big wide world 
The American Girl

The American Girl, out in the dark 
She's looking for love, oh oh 
The American Girl, she breaks hearts 
But that's not enough 
She's such a mystery to me

The American Girl, out in the dark 
She's looking for love, oh oh 
The American Girl, she breaks hearts 
But that's not enough

The American Girl, out in the dark 
She's looking for love, oh oh 
The American Girl, she breaks hearts
