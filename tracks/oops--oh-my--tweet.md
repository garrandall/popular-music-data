Tell you what I did last night
I came home, say, around a quater to three
Still so high
Hypnotized
In a trance
From this body, so butter and brown and tantalizing
You woulda thought I needed help from this feeling that I felt
So shook I had to catch my breath


Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my
Oops, there goes my skirt dropin' to my feet
Oh my
Ooh, some kinda touch careesing my legs
Oh my
Ooh I'm turning red
Who could this be?

I tried and I tried to avoid
but this thing was happening
Swollow my pride
Let it ride and party
But this body felt just like mines
I got worried
I looked over to the left
A reflection of myself
That's why I couldn't catch my breath


Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my
Oops, there goes my skirt dropin' to my feet
Oh my
Ooh, some kinda touch careesing my legs
Oh my


Uh, yeah, yeah, Desert storm, yeah
Fabolous, yeah, Tweet, yeah

Shorty I strickly wanna spank you
The most I gotta do is spell my name to get your 
Vickies to your ankles
I'm serious mami
You're fuckin wit the kid
aka William H period Bonnie
You know I'm the type
that be Crushin and merkin
Havin ladies touchin the herk
And blushin and smirkin
Early in the morning rushin for workin
Screaming Ooh My F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S
Each night I'm freakin
Ma, you ain't gonna talk me to death 
cause you got free nights and weekends
Ghetto Fab's all over the place
Oops there goes my kids all over you face
Ooh My


(I looked over to the left)
Umm I was looking so good I couldn't reject myself
(I looked over to the left)
Umm I was feeling so good I had to touch myself
(I looked over to the left)
Umm I was eyein my thighs butter pecan brown
(I looked over to the left)
Umm comin outta my shirt and then the skirt came down


Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my
Oops, there goes my skirt dropin' to my feet
Oh my
Ooh, some kinda touch careesing my legs
Oh my
Ooh I'm turning red
Who could this be?

Ooh My
