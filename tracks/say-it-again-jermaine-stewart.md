Say it again, oh baby
Please say it one more time for me
I don't believe I heard you right
Did you say you love me? Mmm-hm
(Ohohooh

We've been friends, real close friends, for a long time
I can tell there's something heavy hanging on your mind
Action speaks louder than words
I was sure you said it right when you said last night
"I love you"

Say it again, oh honey
Please say it one more time for me
I don't believe I heard you right
Did you say you love me?
(Ohohooh
Say it again and again and again and again

Sitting here with your head in a crazy spin
Don't be afraid to let this love affair begin
Hold me, tell me what's on your mind
I'll always have the time to hear those words
"I love you"

Say it again, oh honey
Please say it one more time for me
I don't believe I heard you right
Did you say you love me?
(Ohohooh
Say it again and again and again and again

Hold me, tell me what's on your mind
I'll always have the time to hear those words
"I love you"

Say it again, oh honey
Please say it one more time for me
I don't believe I heard you right
Did you say you love me?
(Ohohooh
Did I hear you say you love me?
(Ohohooh
I need to hear you say you love me
(Ohohooh
Oh!

Say it again, oh honey
Please say it one more time for me
I don't believe I heard you right
Did you say you love me?

I don't believe I heard you right
I need to hear you one more time
I don't believe I heard you right
I need to hear you one more time
I don't believe I heard you right
I need to hear you one more time
I don't believe I heard you right
I need to hear you one more time

Say it, say it again
I don't believe I hear you right
Is there something on your mind?
Say it, say it again
I don't believe I heard you right
Say it again and again and again
Say it, say it again
I don't believe I heard you right
Say it, say it again
I don't believe I heard you right
Say it again, say it

Say it again, oh honey
Please say it one more time for me
I don't believe I heard you right
Did you say you love me?

I don't believe I heard you right
I need to hear you one more time
I don't believe I heard you right
I need to hear you one more time

Say it, say it again
I don't believe I hear you right
Is there something on your mind?
Say it, say it again
I don't believe I heard you right
Say it again and again and again
Say it, say it again
I don't believe I heard you right
I don't believe I heard you right
Say it, say it again
I don't believe I heard you right
Say it, say it again
I don't believe I heard you right
I need to hear you one more time
