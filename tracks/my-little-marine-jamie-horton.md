The Marines are sending my boyfriend
Somewhere across the sea
I know I'll cry my heart out
When they take him from me

How could they be so mean
To my little Marine
He's really all that I've got
And I love him an awful lot

The Marines are sending my boyfriend
Somewhere across the sea
I know I'll cry my heart out
When they take him from me

Oh, my little Marine
Though I'll have oceans between
You'll still be all that I've got
And I love you an awful lot
