Christmas comes just once a year (I got a baby doll) 
With all its yuletide joy and cheer (I got a football) 
But theres one thing I'd like to say 
Is that I hate Christmas day (I got a rock!) 

Its time for everybody to have a christmas party. 
Everyone but me I'll step outside 
Boycott your office party. 
No secret Santa for me. 
Mistletoe makes me sneeze anyway. 
Cos I don't wanna go, where happy days are snow 
I'd rather stay where 
Frosty melts in the sun. 
July 4 parade. 
A Lynchburg lemonade. 
An alcohol-a-day by the pool in the sun (now everybody sing).

 
Deck the halls with bells of holly 
'Tis the season to be jolly but, 
I hate Christmas 
I'm glad it only comes one time a year 

Its time for everybody to head out Christmas shopping. 
Everyone but me I'll stay inside. 
No presents under your tree that have a nametag for me. 
And it makes my gifts so easy to hide 
I don't wanna go where shopping lines are slow. 
I rather stay at home with the frosty cold one. 
A bud on ice in may, a lazy summer day. 
An alcohol-a-day by the pool in the sun (now everybody sing) .

 
Deck the halls with bells of holly 
'Tis the season to be jolly but, 
I hate Christmas 
I'm glad it only comes one time a year 

 
It was the night before Christmas and all through the house, 
All the creatures was chillin like Flint drinkin stout. 
I woke from my sleep, heard 'here comes the boom'. 
I knew that Santa would be comin' soon. 
On Dascher on Donner, Commit, on Blitzen. 
I yelled 'shut up ya'll,' but they wouldn't listen. 
And then he came down with his belly of jello. 
He says, 'where the ladies at cuz I'm a real jolly fellow.' 
Then he gave me a wink and was quick out of sight. 
Merry Christmas to all, and to all a super deeky duper fly night.


(now everyone - sing) 
Deck the halls with bells of holly 
'Tis the season to be jolly but, 
I hate Christmas 
I'm glad it only comes one time a year (one more time, like you mean it) 

 
Deck the halls with bells of holly 
'Tis the season to be jolly but, 
I hate Christmas 
I'm glad it only comes one time a year 
Cos I hate Christmas I'm glad it only comes one time a year 
Cos I hate Christmas I'm glad it only comes one time a year
