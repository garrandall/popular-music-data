I-I-I-I-I-I need, I need you
I-I-I-I-I-I need, I need you
I-I-I-I-I-I need, I need you


I never said I wasn't gonna tell nobody
No, baby
But this good lovin', I can't keep it to myself
Oh, no
When we're together, it's like hot coals in a fire
Hot, baby
My body's burning so come on, heed my desire
Come on, come on!


Two of hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts
I need you! I need you!
Two of hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts (Two hearts)
Come on! Come on!


People get jealous 'cause we always stay together
Yeah, baby
I guess they really want a love like yours and mine
Together, forever
I never thought that I could ever be this happy
Yeah, baby
My prayers were answered, boy, you came in the nick of time
Whoa, whoa, whoa!


I got this feeling that you're going to stay
I never knew that it could happen this way
Before I met you I was falling apart
But now, at last, I really know that we are


Two of hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts
I need you! I need you!
Two of hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts (Two hearts)
Come on! Come on!


I-I-I-I-I-I need, I need you
I-I-I-I-I need
I-I-I-I-I-I need
I need, I need, I need you


I never said I wasn't gonna tell nobody
No, baby
But this good lovin', I can't keep it to myself
Oh, no
When we're together it's like hot coals in a fire
Hot, baby
My body's burning so come on, heed my desire
Whoa, whoa, whoa!


I got this feeling that you're going to stay
I never knew that it could happen this way
Before I met you I was falling apart
But now, at last, I really know that we are


Two of hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts
I need you! I need you!
Two of hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts (Two hearts)
Come on! Come on!

Two of hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts
I need you! I need you!
Two of hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts (Two hearts)
Come on! Come on!
