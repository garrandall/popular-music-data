Everytime I'm telling secrets
I remember how it used to be
And I realized how much I miss you
And I realize how it feels to be free

Now I see I'm up to no good (no, no good)
And I wanna start again
Can't remember when I felt good (felt good baby)
No I can't remember when

No, only in my dreams
As real as it may seem
It was only in my dreams

Couldn't see how much I missed you (now I do)
Couldn't see how much it meant (ahh)
Now I see my world come tumbling down
(Tumbling down my world)
Now I see the road is bent

If I only once could hold you (no, no, no)
And remember how it used to be (ahh)
If only I could scold you
And forget how it feels to be free

No, only in my dreams
As real as it may seem
It was only in my dreams

No,
No, no, no, only in my dreams
As real as it may seem
It was only in my dreams

No, only in my dreams
As real as it may seem
It was only in my dreams

No,
No, no, no, only in my dreams
As real as it may seem
It was only in my dreams

No, no, no, only in my dreams
As real as it may seem
It was only in my dreams
