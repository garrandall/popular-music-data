Out on the street I was talkin' to a man
He said "there's so much of this life of mine that I don't understand"
You shouldn't worry, I said, that ain't no crime
Cause if you get it wrong you'll get it right next time (next time)

You need direction, yeah you need a name
When you're standing in the crossroads every highway looks the same
After awhile you get to recognize the signs
So if you get it wrong you'll get it right next time (next time)

Life is a liar yeah life is a cheat
It'll lead you on and pull the ground from underneath your feet
No use complainin', don't you worry, don't you whine
Cause if you get it wrong you'll get it right next time (next time)

You gotta grow, you gotta learn by your mistakes
You gotta die a little everyday just to try to stay awake
When you believe there's no mountain you can climb
And if you get it wrong you'll get it right next time (next time)

Next time, hmmmmm
