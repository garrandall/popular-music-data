Hey girl, I want you to know
I'm going to miss you so much if you go.
And hey girl, I'll tell you no lie
Something deep inside of me is going to dye.
If you say so long, if this is goodbye.
Whoa

Hey girl, this can't be true
How am I suppose to exist without you?
And hey girl, now don't put me on
What's going to happen to me when you're gone?
How will I live, how can I go on?
How can I go on, hey girl



Hey girl, now sit yourself down.
I'm not ashame to get down on the ground
And beg you, baby. Beg you to stay.
Don't go away.

Hey girl.
Naw, naw, don't go away.
Hey girl, little girl, don't go away.
I'm beggin' you to stay.
Little girl, don't go away.
Hey girl, little girl, don't go away.
