Who da hell you think you messin' wit
Tryin' to play me like a fool
I overheard a conversation
Between your ex-girlfriend and you
Then I saw it so clearly
Suddenly it all made since
Before you go on explaining yourself
Let me explain my evidence


No that's not my shade of lipstick
Or my scratch marks on your back
Is it her that you wanna be with
You got me involved in some talk show shit

I made the bed before work this mornin'
Come home later and there's new sheets on it
Your gonna lose the one your with
You got me involved in some talk show shit

I felt like you was hiding something
When you started showering alone
And someone used my Chanel perfume
Since this moment when I left home
You tiptoeing in the bedroom
While your thinking I'm asleep
If I catch your ass in one more lie
I'll be telling you to leave


No that's not my shade of lipstick
Or my scratch marks on your back
Is it her that you wanna be with
You got me involved in some talk show shit

He say, she say
You got our business all up in the streets cheatin'
He say, she say
Everyone knows us like we're on t.v

I made the bed before work this mornin'
Come home later and there's new sheets on it
Your gonna lose the one your with
You got me involved in some talk show shit

No that's not my shade of lipstick
Or my scratch marks on your back
Is it her that you wanna be with
You got me involved in some talk show shit

I made the bed before work this mornin'
Come home later and there's new sheets on it
Your gonna lose the one your with
You got me involved in some talk show shit

He say, she say
He say, she say
He say, she say
He say, she say


No that's not my shade of lipstick
Or my scratch marks on your back
Is it her that you wanna be with
You got me involved in some talk show shit
