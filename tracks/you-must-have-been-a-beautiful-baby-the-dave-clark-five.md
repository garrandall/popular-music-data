You must have been a
Beautiful baby, yeah, yeah
You must have been
A beautiful child

Cause when you was only
Starting to go to kindergarten
I bet you drove those
Other childs wild

Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah

Oh, when it came
To winning blue ribbons
I bet you showed
Those other kids how

I can see the judges eyes
As he handed you the prize
You must have did the cutest bow

Oh, you must've been a beautiful baby
Oh, baby, won't you look at you now

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, beautiful, oh, beautiful
Oh, you got to sock it to me, baby

Oh, when it came
To winning blue ribbons
I bet you showed
Those other kids how

I can see the judges eyes
As he handed you the prize
I bet you did the cutest bow

Yeah, you must've been a beautiful baby
Oh, baby, won't you look at you now

Yeah, now when it came
To winning blue ribbons
Yeah, yeah
I bet you did the cutest bow

I can see the judges eyes
As he handed you the prize
You must have did the cutest bow

Oh, you must've been a beautiful baby
Oh, baby, won't you look at you now
Baby, won't you look at you now
