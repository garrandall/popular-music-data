They say that life is a two-way street
And you're not sure
You gotta trust your feet
To know the right way

You can keep on movin' with your head down
Or you can stop and take a look around
And that's the choice I've made

It's for that movie inside your head
Making memories we can't forget
And when you can't forget

You're gonna know in your soul
This is what we came here for
So live it loud
Here and now
This moment, it won't be ignored
So why not open up that door?
It's what we came here for

For every song we let play outside
The melodies began to write
Every time we sing
Friends we've made, fun we've had
Memories gonna make me laugh
It's a beautiful thing
So beautiful

I want to say ti around the world (all around the world)
Cause everybody should feel this good
'Cause when you feel this good

You're gonna know in your soul
This is what we came here for
So live it loud
Here and now
This moment, it won't be ignored
So why not open up that door?
It's what we came here for

No
The fun's just getting started
Just celebrating where we are
And loving who we are

You're gonna know in your soul
This is what we came here for
So live it loud
Here and now
This moment, it won't be ignored

You're gonna know in your soul
This is what we came here for
So live it loud
Here and now
This moment it won't be ignored (it won't be ignored)
So why not open up that door
So come on open up that door
It's what we came here (oh yeah)
That's what we came here
Came here for
