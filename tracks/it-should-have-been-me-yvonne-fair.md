I saw my love walking down the aisle
And as he passed me by
He turned to me and gave me a smile

Then the preacher, then the preacher
The preacher joined their hands
And all the people, the people began to stand

When I shouted, "It should have been me
No, it should have been me
You know it should have been me
Baby how can you do this to me?"

"You made a promise that we'd never part
Then you turned around and you broke my, my heart
Now you're standing there saying "I do"
Holding hands with somebody new"

"When you know that it should have been me
No, it should have been me
Oh, it should have been me
Baby how can you do this to me?"

Then the preacher, whoa yeah
The preacher asked that there be silence please
"If any objections to this wedding
Speak now or forever, forever hold your peace"

And I stood up and said:
"It should have been me
No, it should have been me!"
Jumped out of my seat and screamed "It should have been me!
Oh, don't blow away my mind
People, believe me, that man is mine
It should have been me
No, you know it should have been me
Oh, it should have been me
Oh, somebody call the police
That woman down there is a doggone thief
It should have been me
No doubt, it should have been me
Oh, it should have been me..."
