I'm in my zone I'm feeling it
Stop blowing my buzz quit killing it
So buy another round
They tried to shut us down
About an hour ago
But we still in this bitch
Turn this shit up loud
And buy another round
They tried to shut us down
About an hour ago
But we still in this bitch

I pull up, pull up, pull up in that automatic cook up
B Rich pull up in that rooster 'til we wake the fucking hood up
Got all these pounds of ganja, I work out, I'm doing kush-ups
Bobby Bands is in the building, pop that pussy throw a foot up
In the air, one time for a nigga like me with a squad like this
With a team so strong with a flow so cold, ain't nothing but some bad bitches in my clique
What's up Eastside?
We in this bitch
They think they seeing me
But they ain't seen shit
Girls on the pole yeah they make me rich
Girls at my shows wanna take my pic
Yeah we can do this here all night, can't tell me nothing, can't tell me shit
All in my zone, all on my own
Open that pack, rollin' that strong
And we still up in this bitch, won't turn down, won't go home

I'm in my zone I'm feeling it
Stop blowing my buzz quit killing it
So buy another round
They tried to shut us down
About an hour ago
But we still in this bitch
Turn this shit up loud
And buy another round
They tried to shut us down
About an hour ago
But we still in this bitch


I got big wheels on my ride, spent about six mills on my ride
You catch me swervin' all on your side of town bumpin' "Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe"
Don't blow my high, just blow my jock, I'm so paid, I'm so fly
Your baby daddy disrespect me, black his eye, that's no lie
I'm on my square, blowing circles in the air, of that purple
I'm a boss and you a worker, listen here boy don't make me hurt you
You want trouble I got plenty, how you want it full or semi
I'm so rich so all that fuckboy shit you kickin' don't offend me
Don't get killed of in this bitch, I spent mills all on this shit
Boy it's been eleven years of this shit, look at me now still in this bitch
I stand tall no can fall, you pussy ass niggas can't touch a G
See me don't speak ain't' nothing G, I'm in my zone nigga don't fuck with me


I'm in my zone I'm feeling it
Stop blowing my buzz quit killing it
So buy another round
They tried to shut us down
About an hour ago
But we still in this bitch
Turn this shit up loud
And buy another round
They tried to shut us down
About an hour ago
But we still in this bitch


Juicy J stay in the club, me and all my niggas
All these bad bitches, all this free liquor
Surrounded by so many women one of these hoes might be your wife
She lookin' for a nigga that's ballin' so tonight might be her night
You know me I stay stuntin', lowkey I threw tuition at Onyx
Flip money fast like Sonic, rich nigga I speak Ebonics
Got a new car I paid cash, got a new crib with a weed lab
Crisp bills I need that, fuck your team where the freaks at
Hundred deep in V.I.P., niggas always hatin'
I came in with a bunch of goons and I'm leavin' with out with his lady
I got your boo in my Bugatti, she bout to swallow my babies
My system loud my weed loud, no hair clippers I'm faded


I'm in my zone I'm feeling it
Stop blowing my buzz quit killing it
So buy another round
They tried to shut us down
About an hour ago
But we still in this bitch
Turn this shit up loud
And buy another round
They tried to shut us down
About an hour ago
But we still in this bitch
