I don't ask for too many things
Only one thing I really need
That is you baby next to me
With that I'm satisfied
Don't need diamonds
I don't need gold
I just need someone here to hold
To keep me warm when the nights are cold
That would do just fine, just fine


You don't have to promise me the stars
Just promise me love, inside your heart
And that's enough
Baby that's enough


(Give me you)
Give me you, give me all of you
(Give me night)
All my nights spent just holding you
(Give me day)
All my days being close to you
Nothing else that I need
(Give me you)
Give me you, give me all your love
(Give me time)
All your time, all your tender time
(All your heart)
All your soul baby that's enough
Nothing else that I need
Give me you, give me you
That's enough for me baby


Hm
I don't need things that money buys
All I need is there in your eyes
I just need your heart next to mine
All my whole life through


You don't have to bring the moon to me
Just bring me the love
The love that I need
And that's enough
Oh baby that's enough


(Give me you)
Give me you, give me all of you
(Give me night)
All my nights spent just holding you
(Give me day)
All my days being close to you
Nothing else that I need
(Give me you)
Give me you, give me all your love
(Give me time)
All your time, all your tender time
(All your heart)
All your soul baby that's enough
Nothing else that I need
Give me you, give me you
That's enough for me baby


You don't have to promise me the stars
Just promise me that I have your heart
You don't have to bring the world to me
Just give me your word, you will never leave
Cause having you beside me, I have everything I need
So give me, give me you


(Give me you)
(Give me night)
All my nights spent just holding you
(Give me day)
All my days being close to you
Nothing else that I need, oh
(Give me you)
Give me you, give me all your love
(Give me time)
All your time, all your tender time
(All your heart)
All your soul baby that's enough
That's enough, nothing else that I need
Give me you, give me you
That's enough for me baby, yeah
Give me you
