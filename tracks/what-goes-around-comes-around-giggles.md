You came into my life and said you'd give me love
You promised I would never hurt again
I believed your words
I had trust in you
I was just a fool
Your love was never true
But no more tears will be shed from my eyes anymore
I know I'll be strong and you will be gone
These silly games will end
You'll never break my heart again
Tell him why girlfriend

Chorus:
'Cause what goes around, comes around
That's what people say
Some of the pain that you have caused me will come back to you
'Cause what goes around, comes around
That's what people say
Some of the pain that you have caused me will come back to you someday

You had something really good and then you let it go
And now you say you want me here to hold
Are you blind to see
We will never be
So don't you think about coming back to me
I gave you all the love a man would ever need
But then you did me wrong
With you I don't belong
Now I'll get over you
But someday you will get yours too
Tell him why girlfriend


Girl:
What goes around, comes around
That's not a fiction, that's a fact
Some men think they got it like that
Women like me you better respect
If you don't I'll put you in check
I've been hurt so many times before
I'm not gonna take this anymore
Sorry Charlie about the door

Guy:
Woman, what's wrong with you
Saying that my love was never true
You just wanted me for my money
Now I know you're someone else's honey
You spread rumours all around town
Talking about what goes around, comes around
You better think before you speak
Don't go putting the blame on me

Tell him why girlfriend
