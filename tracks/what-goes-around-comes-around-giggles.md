Aiyyo, somethin' funny, somethin' got you caught up in digs
It's me, why you wanna pimp with today?
Two made from the boy, yeah
Now, helpless, he's tryin' cause he full of giggles
You gonna need more than an iron to stretch out ya wrinkles
You startin' so ordinary, and me, map me out for sprinkler
You got the fever for the flavor for the giggles
Who got the giggles is the jam of December, hey
I remember we release specifically
Back in grammar school days it's me the E's-M-T
Totally and directly, wonder, more than too fresh and nuttin' really else today
It was my accent and where I came from that ya really hate
The 'N' wear - Levi's, Pumas, struggle Adidas
Some say I'm with the losers cause I didn't have the ladies
No R-E-F-P's, the T as we can't get no punanny
Definitely hittin' them daily
Now I roll with the squad that's so hard and makes
you wanna catch an erection - relax man!!
I don't allow you to put-out actin' on if the one's direction
So it's Pete Prop, yo what's up man, hah
So if ya were thankful then I see cause the paper
gettin' murderin' like the a-lovin' - now the news - Rodney King is
now with the double list comin' through your speakers
remember durin' steebers, why don't you get your speakers tweetered, whoo!!


Who got the giggles?
You got the giggles, they got the giggles
Everybody got the giggles
Who got the giggles?
You got the giggles, they got the giggles
Everybody got the giggles


Now ya wanna be down, you come around, touch gun of the town
You gotta dig my sound - Wow!!
It seems like everybody's jumpin' on the bandWAGON!!
Her money grabbin' a chick is a suburban dragon
I wasn't all of that - rappin' - but this is now
What's the matter? Ya milkin' like a freakin' cow
Cat guns yo' Tennessee, here kitty, kitty, kitty
Here pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy cat
You start to smell like one - all you really are was the head
I wanna give a shout-out to those who try and curse
my fave for ?? gat, you were funny though
Shall, shall, leave the play-down
These are the things we can do without, huh
So what's this all about man?
Just when I thought I was chillin' with my Lee's
and my fellas, seeds and my pro-kicks
My style was so deaf, "thuggin' won't even make it fresh" he said
So now I need my tracks that ?bite-neck? Fred
It's that ya mess with, it's just stitches that I thread

Loadin' the clip for-go-twenty-four-Karen-Lead
her double-days, puttin' 'G' at her head - RAPOW!! You're dead


Who got the giggles?
You got the giggles, they got the giggles
Everybody got the giggles
Who got the giggles?
You got the giggles, they got the giggles
Everybody got the giggles


Who got the giggles?
You got the giggles, they got the giggles
Everybody got the giggles
Who got the giggles?
You got the giggles, they got the giggles
Everybody got the giggles


You ever havin' the giggles to the HUH!!
The hiccups, the kinda hiccups that makes ya wanna come up
In your face and throw up, you're totally ?smuck?!!
You feelin' dirty and quitter, you neither or either a home or hitter
much more like Peter but couldn't beat her pick
caught in the middle with the rhythm, you're feelin'
wish she trippin', you'll be livin' with the A-hahahahahaha......
The giggles


Who got the giggles?
You got the giggles, they got the giggles
Everybody got the giggles
Who got the giggles?
You got the giggles, they got the giggles
Everybody got the giggles

Who got the giggles man? Who got the giggles man?
Who got the giggles man? Everybody got the giggles
Who got the giggles man? Who got the giggles man?
Who got the giggles man? Everybody got the giggles
Who got the giggles man? Who got the giggles man?
Who got the giggles man? Everybody got the giggles
Who got the giggles man? Who got the giggles man?
Who got the giggles man? Everybody got the giggles
Who got the giggles man? Who got the giggles man?
Who got the giggles man? Everybody got the giggles
Who got the giggles man? Who got the giggles man?
