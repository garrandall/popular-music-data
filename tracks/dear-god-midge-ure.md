Dear God, is there somebody out there?
Is there someone to hear my prayer?
I'm a simple man with simple words to say
Is there some point in asking?
Asking for more only got us where we are today
Lost and alone and afraid

Give me, love for the lonely
Give me, food for the hungry
Give me, peace in our restless world
Give me, hope for the children
Give me, a worldwide religion
Give me, peace in our restless world

Dear God, can you hear me crying?
A whole world crying
Looking for something to say
We had it all and we threw it all away
Is there somebody watching
Somebody watching over the mess that we've made
We're lost and alone and afraid

Give me, love for the lonely
Give me, food for the hungry
Give me, peace in our restless world
Give me, hope for the children
Give me, a worldwide religion
Give me, peace in our restless world

And we need to know there's something good
Though all our years of solitude go on and on and on...

Give me, love for the lonely
Give me, food for the hungry
Give me, peace in our restless world

Oh, oh

Give me, hope for the children
Give me, a worldwide religion
Give me, peace in our restless world

Oh, oh

Give me, love for the lonely
Give me, food for the hungry
Give me, peace in our restless world

Oh, oh

Give me, hope for the children
Give me, a worldwide religion
Give me, peace in our restless world

Dear god, is there somebody out there
Is there someone to hear my prayer
