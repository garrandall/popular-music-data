In spurts we live
Still soft from birth
Like an invisible shield surrounds us
So that nothing hurts

But we're born bald and lonely
And we're knowing one thing only
But we do it one time
We want to do it again, yeah
And when we see it one time
We want to see it again, and again and again

Fallin' for that trap
That I laid for myself
I'm constantly amazed
Yeah, by the cards I'm dealt
And it's agonizing reappraisal
Said Dusty Rhodes
And he's the American Dream

When you do it one time
You want to do it again
And when you see it one time
You want to see it again, and again, and again and again

That's your secret
Keep it
Keep it

That's your secret
Keep it
Keep it



That's your secret
Keep it
Keep it

That's your secret
Keep it
Keep it

That's your secret
Keep it
Keep it

That's your secret
Keep it...
