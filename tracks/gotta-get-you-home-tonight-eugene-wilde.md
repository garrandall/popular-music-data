Oh baby
Gotta get you home with me tonight
Oh baby
Gotta get you home with me tonight

Gotta hold your body tight
Make you scream and shout all night
I'll do those things
That are good... to you lady..
I've got the tools. I'm sure you gonna like...

So kick off you shoes
And lay back and let me soothe you
I'm in No rush
I'll take my time..

A bottle of Dom Pérignon
To get us in the mood
And an atmosphere
That's sure to please you..

Oh lady
Gotta get you home with me tonight
Oh lady
I gotta get you home with me tonight

Gotta hold your body right
Make you scream shout all night
I'll do those things.. that are good to you lady...
When you lay your body next to mine

So, kick off your shoes
And lay back and let me soothe you...
I'm in no rush..
I'll take my time...

A bottle of Dom Pérignon
To get us in the mood
And an atmosphere
That's sure to please you..

Oh lady
Gotta get you home with me tonight
Oh lady
I gotta get you home with me tonight

Bridge:
So come on lady
Let's get into the groove
I've got to get next to you..
No matter what it takes

So come let dance
And make a little romance...

Oh come on lady!
Oh come on girl!
Oh come On girl!

Oh lady
Gotta get you home with me tonight
Oh lady
I gotta get you home with me tonight

C'mon baby
C'mon baby
C'mon lady
C'mon lady

Oh lady
Gotta get you home with me tonight
Oh lady
I gotta get you home with me tonight

(instrumental break)

Oh lady
Gotta get you home with me tonight
Oh lady
I gotta get you home with me tonight

Oh lady
Gotta get you home with me tonight
Oh lady
I gotta get you home with me tonight
