I need you so
To keep me happy
And if I can't have you
I know I, I know I
Can't go on

I need your arms
I need your arms
Around me so tightly
Yes, I do

You know I
I miss them nightly
(What do you miss the most)
Baby, when you're not at home

When day is done
(When day is done)
I need you so
(Oh, I need you so)

And I lie and wait
Yes, I lie awake, baby
Only to hear, only to hear
Your little knock upon my door

When you leave me
I said I'll try not to worry
I'll try not to worry
Just come back
In a hurry, oh, baby
Cause I need you so
