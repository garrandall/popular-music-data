Well I've driven half my life under the city lights. I'm gonna meet the San Jose Bay.
Workin' hard 'til the sunrise, I've been at it so long.
Got to pack my bags and get me away.

Now come on down, doo doo-yoo doo, takin' it easy.
Come on down, doo doo-yoo doo, everything nice and slow.
Doo doo-yoo doo, takin' it easy. Soon I'll be saying goodbye.

Well those foggy days and nights in San Francisco, got me feelin' so down.
Drivin' cabs for peanuts ain't my idea of livin'. I just got to get away from this town.

Now I'm lookin' for the sunshine, place where I can rest my mind.
Maybe down Mexico way.
There comes a time when for no reason or rhyme,
A man is bound to seek a sunnier day, bound to seek a sunnier day.
Now come on down...
