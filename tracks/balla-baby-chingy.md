You know the definition... of a Balla
That's me... C-H-I-N-G to the Y
Lemme explain it to you though


I'mma Balla (Balla) SAY WHAT
High Rolla Baby (Baby BABY)
Shot-caller balla (that's right)
Drivin chickens crazy
You a hata (You a hata)
Why you tryna play me (I don't think he know)
Fake playa (Fake playa)
Scarred I'll take ya lady
Ain't nobody gettin it like me (I'mma balla fa real)


Girl I know you do the nasty (nasty)
I can tell when ya (when ya) walk past me (past me)
And ya Prada lookin flashy
Errthang on ya mind jus ask me
I know my err{ear} related to the wasky wabbit
Carrots{karets} all in it jazzy, it's a habit (uh)
Wurrs my cash? Outside - I gotta Benz & Jag
Both sittin on chrome Mags
Is ya down for gettin dirty wit a Git It Boy?
All I need is one night, just to hit it boy
After the club we can take it to a five star telly
Get a suite and lemme put some in ya belly
What's ya name? Sheena? Aw thought you was Shelly
Don't matta - 4 o'clock juss be ready
For a episode you prolly won't come - back from
Ya mama must be thick...that's where ya get ya back from?


I'mma Balla (Balla) SAY WHAT
High Rolla Baby (Baby BABY)
Shot-caller balla (that's right)
Drivin chickens crazy
You a hata (You a hata)
Why you tryna play me (I don't think he know)
Fake playa (Fake playa)
Scared I'll take ya lady
Ain't nobody gettin it like me (I'mma balla fa real)


G.I.B. we keep it crackin ask M & Rich (wats up)
The girls on us, so derrty who you rollin wit? (G.I.B.)
From Magic City to The Pink Slip in The Lou
Them chicks love the diamonds that I get from Rob Jewels
We be in the spot, main hang up, flirtin'
We be surrounded by girls...man and I ain't perpin'
All I know is money, cash, hoes like Jay (like Jay)
And I got all 3. No I don't play! (don't play)
Chicks call me "Drama King" like Kay Slay (Kay Slay)
Cuz in the bed I bring it - Yeah! Night & day. (day)
Lettin' rounds off in em like a A.K.
You leavin wit me... tell me is it free or do I have to pay?
Whatchu say?


I'mma Balla (Balla) SAY WHAT
High Rolla Baby (Baby BABY)
Shot-caller balla (that's right)
Drivin chickens crazy
You a hata (You a hata)
Why you tryna play me (I don't think he know)
Fake playa (Fake playa)
Scared I'll take ya lady
Ain't nobody gettin it like me (I'mma balla fa real)


I like em black, white, puerto rican or haitian
Japanese, chinese, or even asian
It don't matta what color on this occasian
Like smoke, take a hit of what I'm blazin
Instead of GOD it's me these girls praisin'.
Meet me at about 6 at the Days Inn.
5 of dem, 1 of me, I'm feelin' caged in.
I'mma pimp... I'mma keep on playin'.
You know I luv em for that 1 night (1 night)
I can take on 10 with my 1 pipe (1 pipe)
Knock em all like a bowlin pin on sight (on sight)
Think I'm shawt changin girl look hurr,
You betta getcha mind right cuz...


I'mma Balla (Balla) SAY WHAT
High Rolla Baby (Baby BABY)
Shot-caller balla (that's right)
Drivin chickens crazy
You a hata (You a hata)
Why you tryna play me (I don't think he know)
Fake playa (Fake playa)
Scared I'll take ya lady
Ain't nobody gettin it like me (I'mma balla fa real)
