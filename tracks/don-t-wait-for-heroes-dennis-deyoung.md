I've got my dreams
I know you think that's crazy
But I won't give up
'Cause I've got this burning desire in me
Oh baby it's me

While the world sleeps
I sit up all night thinking
And making my plans
'Cause there's something special ahead for me
Something ahead for me

So don't you tell me that I'm wasting my time, ruining my life
And that the odds against me are a million-to-one, don't be concerned
I'll take the heat for all the chances I'm gonna take
Mistakes that I'll make
Wait and see
You're gonna hear from me

So don't wait for heroes, do it yourself
You've got the power
Winners are losers
Who got up and gave it just one more try
One more tryâ€¦ One more try

If you're waiting for that miracle train to call out your name
And if you think the rainbow always finds someone else, never yourself
Just look inside and find that spark that's burning in you
Follow it through
The light you find
Well, it could change your life

So don't wait for heroes
Think for yourself
Make your own choices
You know it's easy
To follow the crowd
But my advice is
Don't wait for heroes
Believe in yourself
You've got the power
Winners are losers
Who got up and gave it just one more try
