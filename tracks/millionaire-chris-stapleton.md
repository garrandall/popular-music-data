They say love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought, and it can't be sold
I've got love enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire

I got a woman with eyes that shine
Down deep as a diamond mine
She's my treasure, so very rare
She's made me a millionaire

When we ride around, ride around this old town
In my beat up car, with the windows down
People look at her, then they look at me
They say that boy, he's sure living in luxury, sweet luxury

Because love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought, no, never could be sold
I've got love, enough to share
That makes me a millionaire

When her kisses fall from everywhere
Like riches on a millionaire
When my pockets are empty and my cupboard is bare
I still feel like a millionaire

Because love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought, no, and it can't be sold
I've got love, enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire
