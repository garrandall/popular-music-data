Lover lover why do you push
Why do you push, why do you push
Baby baby, did you forget about me

I've been standing at the back of your life
Back row centre just above the ice
Please don't ask me how I've been getting off
No please don't ask me how I've been getting off

Break my body, with the back of your hand
Doesn't make sense from where I stand
Baby, baby why you wanna mess it up
Sooner or later I'll find my place
Find my body better fix my face
Please don't ask me
How I've been getting off
No please don't ask me
How I've been getting off

It's a fine line between pleasure and pain
You've done it once you can do it again
Whatever you done don't' try to explain
It's a fine, fine line between pleasure and pain

It's all the same
It's all the same
It's all the same
