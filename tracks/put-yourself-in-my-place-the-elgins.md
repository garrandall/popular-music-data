Put yourself in my place
If only for a day
See if you can stand
The awful hurt I feel inside
And oh
Put yourself in my place
For just a little while
Live through the loneliness
The endless emptiness I go through


Oh, and when you lose a little sleep at night
Cause you ain't been treated right
Then you know heartaches are sad
Sitting by the telephone
Being left all alone
Then you know why I'm feeling bad
(Put yourself in my place)
Oh my, my


Oh, and when you're just about to go insane
Cause it hurts to love in vain
Ask a girl who's been in love
I believed your evil line
Now I'm left alone and crying
Alone to count the stars above
Oh


Put yourself in my place
If only for a day
See if you can stand
The awful hurt I feel inside
Ooo baby
Put yourself in my place
For just a little while
Why don't you try it?
Why don't you try it?
Why don't you try it baby, baby, try it?


Put yourself in my place
Oh baby
C'mon and try it
C'mon and try it
Baby try it, baby try it
Put yourself in my place
