(Cupid)
Cupid draw back your bow
(And let)
Your arrow go
(Straight to my lover's heart)
For me nobody but me

Cupid, "Please hear my cry?"
(And let)
Your arrow fly
(Straight to my lover's heart)
For me
(Straight to my lover's heart)

Now, I don't mean to bother you but I'm in distress
There's danger of me losing all of my happiness
For I love a girl who doesn't know I exist
And this you can fix

(Cupid)
Cupid draw back your bow
(And let)
Your arrow go
(Straight to my lover's heart)

Now, Cupid if your arrow makes her love strong for me
I promise I will love her until eternity
I know between the two of us her heart we can steal
(Help me if you will)

Cupid draw back your bow
(And let)
Your arrow go
(Straight to my lover's heart)
For me
(Straight to my lover's heart)

Don't you hear callin'?
(Straight to my lover's heart)
My tears keep fallin'
(Straight to my lover's heart)
I' gotta have a lot of na na

(Cupid)
Whoa
(Cupid)
Yeah

Look I've loved you for a long time
Now it's time to make you my baby
I've loved you for a long time
Now it's time to make you my baby

I look at you
(You turn away)
I say to you
(Please look my way)
But you say to me
(Leave me alone)
Then I say
I can't live without you

Hey, I've loved you for a long time
Now it's time to make you my baby
I've loved you for a long time
Now it's time to make you my baby

Girl didn't you know that
(My love's for you)
And it hurts me so bad
(I'm telling you)
Come on look at you want
(Try it again)

Then you see you see I can't live without you
I've loved you for a long time
Now it's time to make you my baby
Make you my baby

(Cupid)
Draw back your bow
(And let)
Your arrow go
(Straight to my lover's heart)
For me
(Straight to my lover's heart)

Hear me callin'
(Straight to my lover's heart)
Hear the love's getting stronger
(Straight to my lover's heart)

(Cupid)
All I got to do is callin' louder
(Cupid)
Cupid
(Cupid)
Cupid
(Cupid)
Cupid
