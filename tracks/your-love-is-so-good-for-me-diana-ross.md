Your love is so good for me
Your love is so good for me

Every day you're on my mind
Wanna be near you all the time
You made my poem rhyme
And my heart began to sing again
The day your eyes met mine

Your love is so good for me
Your love is so good for me

Two hearts just running free
Like a wind song through the trees
Your love does not possess
It just holds me where I wanna be
With binds of tenderness

Your love is so good for me
Your love is so good for me

Baby, you know your love is so good
It's good
You know it's good

Like a star up in the sky
Burning brightly, you and I
Time will tell if love survives
For we only have today
And today love is alive

Your love is so good for me
Your love is so good for me

It's so good
You know your love is so good,
So good for me...
It's so good

No need to say the words
When you touch me they will be heard
You gave so much to me
And you showed me how to love the way
True love was meant to be

Your love is so good for me
Your love is so good for me
