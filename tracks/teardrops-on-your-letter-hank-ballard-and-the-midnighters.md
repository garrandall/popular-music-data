Teardrops on your letter
That I got from you
Made me realize
Every word you wrote was true
That you miss me
(You miss me)
And wanna kiss me
(Wanna kiss me)
So I'm coming home to you
Teardrops on your letter
On each word I read
Was the sweetest message
That you have ever said
They told me
(They hold me)
You wanna hold me
(Wanna hold me)
So I'm coming home to you
I hate to know
That you been crying
I hate to see
See you blue
But the teardrops
On your sweet letter
Started me to crying
Crying, crying some too
Oh, oh
Teardrops on your letter
Was a certain sign
When we're not together
We're on each other's mind
Cause I love you
(I love you)
I'm thinking of you
(Thinking of you)
So I'm coming home to you
