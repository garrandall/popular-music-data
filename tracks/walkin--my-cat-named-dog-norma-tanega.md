I'm walkin all around the town
Singin all the people down
Talkin around, talkin around.
Me and my cat named Dog
Are walkin high against the fog
Singin the sun
Singin the sun

Happy, sad and crazy wonder
Chokin up my mind with perpetual dreamin...

I'm driftin up and down the street
Searchin for the sound of people
Swingin their feet, swingin their feet
Dog is a good old cat
People what you think of that?
That's where I'm at, that's where I'm at.

Happy, sad and crazy wonder
Chokin up my mind with perpetual dreamin...

Dog is a good old cat
People what you think of that?
That's where I'm at, that's where I'm at, that's where I'm at.
