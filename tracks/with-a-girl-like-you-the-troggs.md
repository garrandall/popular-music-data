I want to spend my life with a girl like you
Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba
And do all the things that you want me to
Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba

'Til that time has come that we might live as one
Can I dance with you?
Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba

I tell by the way you dress that you're so refined
Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba
And by the way you talk that you're just my kind
Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba

Girl, why should it be that you don't notice me?
Can I dance with you?
Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba

Baby, baby is there no chance
I can take you for the last dance?
All night long yeah, I've been waiting
Now there'll be no hesitating

So before this dance has reached the end
Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba
To you across the floor, my love I'll send
Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba

I just hope and pray that I'll find a way to say
Can I dance with you?
Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba
