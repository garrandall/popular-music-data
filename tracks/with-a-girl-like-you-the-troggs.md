I want to spend my life with a girl like you 
And do all the things that you want me to 

Till that time has come 
That we might live as one 
Can I dance with you 

I tell by the way you dress that you're so refined 
And by the way you talk that you're just my kind 

Girl why should it be 
That you don't notice me 
Can I dance with you 

Baby baby is there no chance 
I can take you for the last dance 
All night long yeah I've been waiting 
Now there'll be no hesitating 

So before this dance has reached the end 
To you across the floor my love I'll send 
I just hope and pray that I'll find a way to say 
Can I dance with you
