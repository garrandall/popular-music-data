But a man gotta do what a man gotta do

Well, a just the loving weh mi fling fling control you girl

And now you want draw card, say me just can't perform

When me leaving, me see the gyal cry cry cry
And it hurts my heart fi tell a lie lie lie
So don't cry no more
Baby girl for sure
Just remember the good times we had before
