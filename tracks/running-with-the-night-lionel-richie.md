The heart of the city street was beating
Lights from the neons
Turned the dark to day
We were too hot to think of sleeping
We had to get out
Before the magic got away

We were running with the night
Playingin the shadows
Just you and i
Till the morning light
(we were running) oh, oh
Running with the night
You were looking so good girl
Heads were turning
You and me on the town
Ooh, we let it all hang out
The fire was in us, we were running
We were gonna go all the way
And we never had a doubt

We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and i
Till the morning light
Running with the night
We were so in love you and me
On the boulevard wild and free
Giving all we got, we laid it down
Taking every shot, we took the town

We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and i
Girl, it was so right
Girl, it was so right.
