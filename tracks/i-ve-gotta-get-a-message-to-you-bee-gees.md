The preacher talked with me and he smiled
Said "Come and walk with me, come and walk one more mile
Now for once in your life you're alone
But you ain't got a dime, there's no time for the phone"


I've just gotta get a message to you
Hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on, hold on


I told him I'm in no hurry
But if I broke her heart, then won't you tell her I'm sorry
And for once in my life, I'm alone
And I gotta let her know just in time before I go


I've just gotta get a message to you
Hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on, hold on


Well I laughed, but that didn't hurt
And it's only her love that keeps me wearing this dirt
Now I'm crying, but deep down inside
Well I did it to him, now it's my turn to die


I've just gotta get a message to you
Hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on, hold on


I've just gotta get a message to her
Hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through
Hold on, hold on
I've just gotta get a message to her
Hold on, hold on
