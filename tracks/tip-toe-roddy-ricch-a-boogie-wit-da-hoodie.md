Rose gold Rollie, I'm the nigga
Put the whole damn hood on
Patron of the new, I help put the drip on
Ask me how many niggas I done put on
My private plane's 'bout to fly with the good O's
I fuck with boujee bitches, fuck a hood hoe
Hit that bitch from the back and told her, "Ditto"
Sitting adjacent, a nigga had to get low
She looking at the Patek like some Skittles
Her husband been talking tough, I turned her widow
Giuseppe got me on my tip toe
Why you wifin' on the flip hoe?
'Bout to strap it, playing give and go
Serving junkies out the window
Tried to rob us, got Extendo
We ain't playing no pretend though

Sipping on this codeine, a nigga gotta speak my mind
I remember we was having pope on them behind, yeah, yeah
I'm gettin' money, I can see the hate inside his eyes, yeah, yeah
Fuck a bitch, I had to grab her by the waist
Hit the pussy till I knock it outta place

In a V12, get a lot of face
Spare the details, finished on her face
And I had the strap when I caught my case
Just got the grow house started in the Bay
I made a hundred plays in a day
Put a AirB bitch inside of the face
And I got the hood damn near riding every day
Putting money on the opps, no face, no case

Rose gold Rollie, I'm the nigga
Put the whole damn hood on
Patron of the new, I had put the drip on
Ask me how many niggas I done put on
My private plane's 'bout to fly with the good Os
I fuck with boujee bitches, fuck a hood hoe
Hit that bitch from the back and told her, "Ditto"
Sitting adjacent, a nigga had to get low
She looking at the Patek like some Skittles
Her husband been talking tough, I turned her widow
Giuseppe got me on my tip toe
Why you wifin' on the flip hoe?
'Bout to strap it, playing give and go
Serving junkies out the window
Tried to rob us, got Extendo
We ain't playing no pretend though

Balenciaga wearing ass nigga
Hoodied up with a mask, nigga
Shit snatched, now you want it back, nigga
I just hope you don't go and rat, nigga
Long Johns, right under the strap, nigga
That's for you staring ass niggas
Sawed-off head tap, double tap, niggas
That's for you rat niggas

No, I can't do no 9-to-5
Nah, nah, nah
I went to work with the strap, nigga
I came around with five
Roddy came with six and we got 11 straps with us
Fuck with my ride or die
Holes in your body, nigga, like Spongebob, and backflip it
Go ta-da-da, ta-da-da
Nigga, I know magic

Rose gold Rollie, I'm the nigga
Put the whole damn hood on
Patron of the new, I had put the drip on
Ask me how many niggas I done put on
My private plane's 'bout to fly with the good Os
I fuck with boujee bitches, fuck a hood hoe
Hit that bitch from the back and told her, "Ditto"
Sitting adjacent, a nigga had to get low
She looking at the Patek like some Skittles
Her husband been talking tough, I turned her widow
Giuseppe got me on my tip toe
Why you wifin' on the flip hoe?
'Bout to strap it, playing give and go
Serving junkies out the window
Tried to rob us, got Extendo
We ain't playing no pretend though
