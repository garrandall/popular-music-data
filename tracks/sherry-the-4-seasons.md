Sherry, Sherry baby
Sherry, Sherry baby
Sherry can you come out tonight
Come, come, come out tonight

Sherry, Sherry baby
Sherry, Sherry baby
Can you come out tonight?
Why don't you come on?
Come on twist party
Where the bright moon shines
We'll dance the night away
I'm gonna make you mine

Sherry, Sherry baby
Can you come out tonight?
Come, come, come out tonight

You'd better ask your Mama
Tell her everything is alright
Why don't you come on, come on?
With your red dress on
You look so fine
You move it nice and easy
You make me lose my mind

Sherry, Sherry baby
Sherry, Sherry baby
Can you come out tonight?
Come, come, come out tonight.
