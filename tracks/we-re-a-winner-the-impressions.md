We're a winner
And never let anybody say
Boy, you can't make it
'Cause a feeble mind is in your way
No more tears do we cry
And we have finally dried our eyes
And we're movin' on up (movin' on up)
Lawd have mercy
We're movin' on up (movin' on up)

We're living proof in alls alert
That we're two from the good black earth
And we're a winner
And everybody knows it too
We'll just keep on pushin'
Like your leaders tell you to
At last that blessed day has come
And I don't care where you come from
We're all movin' on up (movin' on up)
Lawd have mercy
We're movin' on up (movin' on up)

Hey, hey
We're movin' on up (movin' on up)
Lawd have mercy
We're movin' on up (movin' on up)

I don't mind leavin' here
To show the world we have no fear
'Cause we're a winner
And everybody knows it too
We'll just keep on pushin'
Like your leaders tell you to
At last that blessed day has come
And I don't care where you come from
We're just go move on up (movin' on up)
Lawd have mercy
We're movin' on up (movin' on up)
We'll just keep on pushin'
We're a winner
Lawd, baby
Everybody
Hey, you know we're movin' on up
We're a winner
