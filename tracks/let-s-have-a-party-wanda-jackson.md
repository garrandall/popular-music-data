Some people like to rock, some people like to roll
But movin' and a-groovin' gonna satisfy my soul
Let's have a party, hoo, let's have a party
Well, send him to the store, let's buy some more
Let's have a party tonight

I never kissed a bear, I never kissed a goon
But I can shake a chicken in the middle of the room
Let's have a party, hoo, let's have a party
Well, send him to the store, let's buy some more
Let's have a party tonight

I never kissed a bear, I never kissed a goon
But I can shake a chicken in the middle of the room
Let's have a party, hoo, let's have a party
Well, send him to the store, let's buy some more
Let's have a party tonight

Honky Tonky Joe is knockin' at the door
Bring him in and fill him up and set him on the floor
Let's have a party, hoo, let's have a party
Well, send him to the store, let's buy some more
Let's have a party tonight

The meat is on the stove, the bread's a-gettin' hot
Everybody run, he got the possum in the pot
Let's have a party, hoo, let's have a party
Well, send him to the store, let's buy some more
Let's have a party tonight
Let's have a party tonight
Let's have a party tonight
We gon' have a party tonight
