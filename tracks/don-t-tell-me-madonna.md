Don't tell me to stop
Tell the rain not to drop
Tell the wind not to blow
'Cause you said so

Tell the sun not to shine
Not to get up this time, no, no
Let it fall by the way
But don't leave me where I lay down

Tell me love isn't true
It's just something that we do
Tell me everything I'm not
But please don't tell me to stop

Tell the leaves not to turn
But don't ever tell me I'll learn, no, no
Take the black off a crow
But don't tell me I have to go

Tell the bed not to lay
Like the open mouth of a grave, yeah
Not to stare up at me
Like a calf down on its knees

Tell me love isn't true
It's just something that we do
Tell me everything I'm not
But don't ever tell me to stop (Don't you ever tell)

Tell me love isn't true
It's just something that we do (Don't you ever tell)
Tell me everything I'm not
But don't ever tell me to stop (Don't you ever)

Please don't
Please don't
Please don't tell me to stop (Don't you ever tell)
Don't you ever
Don't ever tell me to stop (Tell the rain not to drop)

Tell the bed not to lay
Like a open mouth of a grave, yeah
Not to stare up at me
Like a calf down on its knees

Tell the bed not to lay
Like a open mouth of a grave, yeah
Not to stare up at me
Like a calf down on its knees
