Little Frankie went down to the barroom, she asked for a glass of beer
She said, "Hey, bartender, has my Johnny been here?"
"He's my man but he's done me wrong"
The bartender said "Frankie, ya know I won't tell ya no lie"
"He left here about a minute ago with a gal named Alice Fry"
"He's your man, but he's doin' you wrong"
Frankie was a good little woman, surely everybody knows
She paid one hundred dollars for Johnny's new suit of clothes
She loved her man but he done her wrong
Well then Frankie went down Broadway with a razor in her hand
She said "Stand back, all you women, I'm here for my cheatin' man"
"Yes, he's my man but he's done me wrong"
It was on a Friday mornin' about a ha'past nine o'clock
Frankie pulled her 44 and fired three fatal shots
She shot her man 'cause he done her wrong
(Why dontcha run, Frankie?) they said (Frankie why don't you run?)
'Cause here come the Chief Of Police with the 44 smokeless gun
You killed your man, we know he done you wrong
SPOKEN while FADING
Yeah, he done you wrong, Frankie
You shoulda shot him forty times
I'm a witness, Frankie, I was there
When you shot that man I saw
