Well I just met you a couple hours ago
My last night in town, hey wouldn't you know
I get hooked on a girl with blue diamond eyes
Down here in Mexico, oh
Now you're walking up asking me to dance
Smiling that smile and reaching out your hand
Well there's a move or two, I'd like to show you
While I still got the chance

Well you got the soul and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip cause you know that I'll lose it
You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music
Oh oh, why wouldn't I wanna stay?
Oh oh, and let that plane fly away, hey hey

Cause you got the soul and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip cause you know that I'll lose it
You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music
The beat of the music

I think I could get used to that steel drum playing
Waking up on a beach if you know what I'm saying
One more night would be more than alright with me
So hold on baby cause

You got the soul and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip cause you know that I'll lose it
You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music
We're falling in love to beat of the music
Beat of the music
