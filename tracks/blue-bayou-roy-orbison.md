I feel so bad, I got a worried mind
I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind on Blue Bayou
Saving nickels, saving dimes
Working till the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times on Blue Bayou

I'm going back someday come what may to Blue Bayou
Where you sleep all day and the catfish play on Blue Bayou
All those fishing boats with their sails afloat if I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes how happy I'd be

Gonna see my baby again
And to be with some of my friends
Maybe I'd be happier then on Blue Bayou
Saving nickels, saving dimes
Working till the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times on Blue Bayou

I'm going back someday gonna stay on Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine, and the world is mine
On Blue Bayou
And that girl of mine by my side
The silver moon and the evening tide
Some sweet day gonna take away this hurting inside

I'll never be blue my dreams come true on Blue Bayou
