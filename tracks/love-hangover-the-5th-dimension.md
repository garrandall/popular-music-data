If there's a cure for this
I don't want it, I don't want it
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it, don't want it

Think about it all the time
Thinking only makes me smile
And say, hey
(Hey, hey)

(Got a love hangover)
I don't wanna shake it
(Got a love hangover)
I love the love you're making

If there's a cure for this
I don't want it, I don't want it
If there's a remedy
I'll run from it, run from it

Think about it all the time
Never let it out of my mind
'Cause I love you
(Love you)
(Love you, love you, love you, baby)

Got the sweetest hangover
(I don't wanna get over)
Sweetest hangover, yeah
(I don't wanna get over)

I don't wanna get
I don't wanna get
(Over)

I don't wanna get over
I don't wanna get over
I don't wanna get over
I don't wanna get over

I don't need a cure for this
Don't want it, don't need it
Don't want it, don't need it
(I've got a love hangover)

(Well, well, well, well)
I've got a love hangover
I've got a love hangover
I've got a love hangover

'Cause if there's a cure for this
I don't want it, oh, baby
If there's a cure for this
I don't need it, oh

Don't need no doctor
Don't need no lawyer
Don't need no preacher
Don't need no teacher

Don't need no doctor
Don't need no lawyer
Don't need no preacher
Don't need no teacher

Don't need no doctor
Don't need no lawyer
Don't need no preacher
Don't need no teacher

Don't need no doctor
Don't need no lawyer
Don't need no preacher
Don't need no teacher

I think about all the while
'Cause you're the only one
That makes me smile

You've got me shaking
Oh sweet love you're making
Oh love me, love me, baby
Oh love me, love me, sweet baby
Love me, oh, oh

(I've got a love hangover)
I've got a love hangover
The sweetest hangover

(I've got a love hangover)
Well, well, well, well, well
