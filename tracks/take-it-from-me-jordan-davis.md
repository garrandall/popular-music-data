I think me and you should blow this off
So much for the after-party, let's tell everybody we got lost
I think me and you should do our own thing
Our own way, at my place, why wait

Take it from me if you want a t-shirt to sleep in
It's my favorite but you can keep it
Looks good baby you should leave it
Hanging off your shoulder
Now give me them bare feet dancing down the hallway
And smiling at me running your finger down the wall
You know what I want, I got what you need
Take it from me

Maybe you should stop right now, right here
Right where we wanna be I'll spin you around and let's just see
Where this thing goes, all I know is that I'm all yours, all night
I've got nothing but time

So take it from me if you want a t-shirt to sleep in
It's my favorite but you can keep it
Looks good baby you should leave it
Hanging off your shoulder
Now give me them bare feet dancing down the hallway
And smiling at me running your finger down the wall
You know what I want, I got what you need
Take it from me
Take it from me, yeah

You can steal a kiss, I won't call you a thief
But take it from me
What I got to give you can have for free
Just take it from me

Take it from me if you want a t-shirt to sleep in
It's my favorite but you can keep it
Looks good baby you should leave it
Hanging off your shoulder
Now give me them bare feet dancing down the hallway
And smiling at me running your finger down the wall
You know what I want, I got what you need
Take it from me
Just take it from me

Take my word, take my heart
Take my kiss and maybe take it too far
But baby take it from me
Oh, just take it from me

You can steal a kiss, I won't call you a thief
But take it from me
What I got to give you can have for free
Just take it from me

Oh, just take it from me
