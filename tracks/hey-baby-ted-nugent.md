Hey baby, tell me why you hangin 'round
Ain't got time for kissin I'm too busy messin in this town
All you pretty women, you're so far an' in between
I don't need no fancy types I need the ones that's clean

Hey baby, jump into the back of my Ford
I'm gonna give you a ride baby, you never could afford
Hey baby
Hey baby
So
Follow me down to my house baby I'll show you the real love game
Yes I will

Hey baby, jump into the back of my car
I'm gonna kiss and hug you baby I'm gonna steal your heart
All you pretty women, you're so far an' in between
I don't need no fancy types I need the ones that's clean

Hey baby, I don't want you hangin 'round
I ain't got time for kissin I'm too busy steppin in this town
Hey baby
Hey baby

So
Follow me down to my house baby I'll show you the real love game

You know what I'm talkin about baby
Here we go

Hey baby, tell me why you hangin 'round
Ain't got time for nothin steady I'm too busy runnin 'round
All you pretty women, you're so far an' in between
I don't need no fancy types I need the ones that's clean

Hey baby, jump into the back of my car
I'm gonna give you love babe that's gonna steal your heart
Hey baby
ooooooooh
Hey baby
I wantcha to
Follow me down to my house baby
I'll show you the real love game

Love game
Love game
