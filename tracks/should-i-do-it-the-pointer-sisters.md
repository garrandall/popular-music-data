I swore when he hurt me so
I wouldn't see him anymore
But today he called my name
Oh, I could feel the same old flame

Should I do it, should I fall?
Should I do it after all?
Is it crazy, is it right?
I really wanna love him tonight

Should I do it, should I play?
Can I help it anyway?
When I feel him hold me tight
I'm gonna turn on like a light

I know when we're in his car
I couldn't go just so far
I wanna give him everything
So when I hear the telephone ring, yeah

Should I do it, should I fall?
Should I do it after all?
Is it crazy, is it right?
I really wanna love him tonight

Should I do it, should I play?
Can I help it anyway?
When I feel him hold me tight
I'm gonna turn on like a light

Oh, I'm so lonely and he's so fine
Maybe I should swallow my pride
Just one, one, one more time, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I really got to know

Should I do it, should I fall?
Should I do it after all?
Is it crazy, is it right?
I really wanna love him tonight

Should I do it, should I play?
Can I help it anyway?
When I feel him hold me tight
I'm gonna turn on like a light

Should I do it? Should I do it?
Should I do it? Should I do it?
Should I do it? Should I do it?
Should I do it? Should I do it?

Should I do it? Should I do it?
Should I do it? Should I do it?
Should I do it? Should I do it?
Should I do it? Should I do it?

Should I do it? Should I do it?
Should I do it? Should I do it?
Should I do it? Should I do it?
Should I do it? Should I do it?

Should I do it? Should I do it?
Should I do it? Should I do it?
