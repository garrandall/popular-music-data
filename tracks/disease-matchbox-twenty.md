Feels like you made a mistake
You made somebody's heart break
But now I have to let you go
I have to let you go


You left a stain
On every one of my good days
But I am stronger than you know
I have to let you go


No one's ever turned you over
No one's tried
To ever let you down
Beautiful girl, bless your heart


I got a disease
Deep inside me
Makes me feel uneasy, baby
I can't live without you
Tell me what am I s'posed to do about it
Keep your distance from it
Don't pay no attention to me
I got a disease


Feels like you're makin' a mess
You're hell on wheels in a black dress
You drove me to the fire
And left me there to burn


Every little thing you do is tragic
All my life before was magic
Beautiful girl
I can't breathe


I got a disease
Deep inside me
Makes me feel uneasy, baby
I can't live without you
Tell me what am I s'posed to do about it
Keep your distance from it
Don't pay no attention to me
I got a disease


Yeah well I think that I'm sick
Better leave me be
While my world is coming down on me
You taste like honey, honey
Tell me can I be your honey
Bee, be strong
Keep tellin' myself that it won't take long 'til
I'm free of my disease
Yeah, well, free of my disease
Free of my disease, oh


I got a disease
Deep inside me
Makes me feel uneasy, baby
I can't live without you
Tell me what am I supposed to do about it
Keep your distance from it
Don't pay no attention to me
I got a disease


Yeah, well, I think that I'm sick
Better leave me be
While my world is comin' down on me
You taste like honey, honey
Tell me can I be your honey
Bee, be strong
Keep tellin' myself that it won't take long 'til
I'm free of my disease
Yeah, well, free of my disease
Set me free of my disease
Oh, yeah
