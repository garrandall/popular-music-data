Yeah
Come on, take a little trip with the Frost
We about to go lowriding

(A lowrider)


Oh yeah, another night on the boulevard
Cruising hard, and everybody's lowridin'
Take a little trip with the Frost
And you know what, man?
Everything is gonna be alright
Yeah, bumper to bumper's all eyes on me
Rolling a Chico G '63
Convertable rag-top, and the rag-top's down
On the killer Daytons with the big boom sound
Lift it front to back, pancake from the bottom up
And when we rolling on 3-0, vato, what's up?
Here comes the homeboys cruising down the loma
Hitting the switches in a 39 bomba
Ha-ha-ha

(Take a little trip)
(Take a little trip)
(Take a little trip and see)	 --> War

Yeah, lowriding
All my homies roll lowriders
Hey
A lowrider is a little flier
Hey

Aiyo ALT, man
What you doin on the boulevard, loco?


Cruisin, the bass escapes from the window
I'm rollin real slow and low, it's Sunday, I gotta go
Yo, you can hear the bass of the rap jams' old breaks
A fly-ass Impalla thump, paint got the gold flakes
Kicking back, and yo, I'm soaring like an eagle
Frost in a jeep, and Ralph M's in a Regal
We're looking at the fine ladies bumping the fresh tapes
Seeing the sparks from my car when the frame scrapes
Girls from blocks and blocks, they come in flocks and flocks
Ready to box, cause my '64 rocks
We call it a caravan, and yes y'all, we're rolling hard
A single file line - on the boulevard

(Take a little trip)
(Take a little trip)
(Take a little trip and see)	 --> War

All my homies roll lowriders
Hey
A lowrider is a little flier
Hey

Aiyo Mellow, man
What's that you're bumpin in your ride, man?
What's that you're bumpin in your ride, homes?
(Ain't got... baby)


I been chasing hotties as a hobby
Mellow's on the bully and I'm out here getting irie
Oh baby, that's the things that I be doing
I think I like to do it more than I like screwing
So get me in your car, honey, I wanna cruise it
I got a jimmy hat in my pocket, I wanna use it
So take me through the canyon of love, I wanna getcha
Yo baby, it don't matter if I just metcha
Just say yeah, cause you got the Jim hard
But that's the price I pay for being on the boulevard
Honeys out here teasing, some be out here pleasing
But some just rub the Jimbrowski for easing
On the boulevard
Yeah
Up on the boulevard
You know what I'm saying
When you're out there cruising
Girlies wanna be using
Jimbrowkisssssss....

All my homies roll lowriders
A lowrider is a little flier

And you know it's fly, ha-ha-ha
