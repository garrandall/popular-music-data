You like to dance
And listen to the music
I like to sing with the band

You like your hands
Splashing in the ocean
Well, I like my feet on the sand


Does anybody have it any better?
Isn't it easy to see
Just how well we fit together


When I start to sing the blues
You pull out my dancing shoes
I think you could be so good for me

You get brave
When I get shy
Just another reason why
I think you could be so good for me
So good


You like to drive
Like Mario Andretti
I like it
Taking my time

But let me say
Wherever you are going
You know it suits me just fine





Could be so good for me
You could be so good
Could be so good
Could be so good for me

You get brave
When I get shy
I know the reason why
You could be so good for
Good for me, baby
Good for me, baby

When I want to sing the blues
Good for me, baby
Oh
When I want to sing the blues
Good for me, baby

You could be so good
Good for me, baby
When I want to sing the blues
Good for me, baby
