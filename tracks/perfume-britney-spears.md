Do I imagine it, or do I see your stare?
Is there still longing there?
Oh, I hate myself and I feel crazy
Such a classic tale
Current girlfriend, ex girlfriend
I'm trying to be cool
I'm being paranoid, am I seeing things?
Am I just insecure?


I want to believe
It's just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there's three
Of us in here, baby


So, I wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me?
And while I wait, I put on my perfume
Yeah, I want it all over you
I gotta mark my territory


I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume


I wanna fill the room, when she's in it with you
Please, don't forget me
Do I imagine it, or catch these moments?
I know you got history
But I'm your girlfriend, now, I'm your girlfriend trying to be cool
I hope I'm paranoid, that I'm just seeing things
That I'm just insecure


I want to believe
It's just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there's three
Of us in here, baby


So, I wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me?
And while I wait, I put on my perfume
Yeah, I want it all over you
I gotta mark my territory
So I, I wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me?
And while I wait, I put on my perfume
Yeah, I want it all over you
I gotta mark my territory


I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume
