Do I imagine it, or do I see your stare?
Is there still longing there?
Oh I hate myself, and I feel crazy
Such a classic tale

Current girlfriend, ex-girlfriend, Iâm trying to be cool
Am I being paranoid? Am I seeing things? Am I just insecure?

I want to believe
Itâs just you and me
Sometimes it feels like thereâs three of us in here, baby

So I wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking âbout her or about me?
And while I wait I put on my perfume,
Yeah, I want it all over you
I'm gonna mark my territory

Iâll never tell, tell on myself but I hope she smells my perfume
Iâll never tell, tell on myself but I hope she smells my perfume
I hide it well, hope you canât tell but I hope she smells my perfume
I hide it well, hope you canât tell but I hope she smells my perfume

I wanna fill the room when sheâs in it with you
Please donât forget me
Do I imagine it, or catch these moments?
I know you got history

But Iâm your girlfriend, now Iâm your girlfriend trying to be cool
I hope Iâm paranoid, that Iâm just seeing things, that Iâm just insecure

I want to believe
Itâs just you and me
Sometimes it feels like thereâs three of us in here, baby

So I, wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking âbout her or about me?
And while I wait I put on my perfume,
Yeah, I want it all over you
I'm gonna mark my territory

So I, wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking âbout her or about me?
And while I wait I put on my perfume,
Yeah, I want it all over you
I'm gonna mark my territory

Iâll never tell, tell on myself but I hope she smells my perfume
Iâll never tell, tell on myself but I hope she smells my perfume
I hide it well, hope you canât tell but I hope she smells my perfume
I hide it well, hope you canât tell but I hope she smells my perfume
