Well I don't know if itâ€™s right or if it's wrong, but I don't care about it anyway
I 've been wondering if you're chasing all the rainbows that I'm making but I'm not sure
See this one-way love affair's OK, but I don't think it's here to stay it's not natural
First it 's one thing then another, baby make me run for cover you don 't want to stop
You don't want to give up

Baby
Don 't stop trying
Don't stop trying
Don't come crying
You better keep away every night and day
Don't stop trying
Don 't stop trying
Don't come crying
You better keep away every night and day
Baby

Now two years later on you're still in touch with what goes on in my private life
And it's not so very private when you're always trying to find out who I'm with
See the situation's kind of strange I think it's something prearranged not natural
But I'm full of admiration for your continuation you don't want to stop
You don't want to give up

Baby
Don't stop trying
Don't stop trying
Don't come crying
You better keep away every night and day
That's where your love lies
Under the blue skies
Don't stop don't give up
Baby
Baby
That's where your love lies
Under the blue skies
Don't stop don't give up
Baby
Baby

Well I don't know if it's right or if it's wrong, but I don't care about it anyway anyway
Now two years later on you're still in touch with what goes on inside my private life private life my private life
Baby, baby, baby
Don't stop trying
Don't stop trying
Don't come crying
You better keep away every night and day
Baby
Don't stop trying. (never give up on a good time baby)
Don't stop trying. (never give up never give up never give up)
Don't come crying
You better keep away (keep away) every night and day
Baby
Don't stop trying
Don't stop trying (never give up on a good time baby)
