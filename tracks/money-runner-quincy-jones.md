It was raining when I met you
You were soaking wet
No time to be impressed
And I remember, so much later on
I knew that you were someone I would not forget
Everybody's searching, hungry for the glamour
You know too many hearts are in a rush
But no matter how you try to
You can't explain the places you find love

No, can't explain it

I can feel it all around me
The need to find the place where feelings can be safe
It's not money that buys happiness
It's not the shine of silver that puts the heart to rest
Everybody's pushing, the clock is always running
And no one ever seems to have enough
And when you least expect it
You come upon the places you find love
Love, love, remember...

In a flash, the feeling can hit you
After all the times that it's missed you
Reaching deep inside to find your secret heart
Yeah, yeah
Look around, you'll notice you're flying
And for once, you're not even trying
City lights below you like a million tiny stars


It's a river never stopping
Winding in and out, but you should never doubt
It will lead you to the ocean someday
There's no way to fight it, let it carry you away, oh
Everybody's dreaming, waiting for the feeling
For that moment when they finally rise above
But it's always in the giving
That gets you to the places that you find love
Yeah, yeah

In the poorest part of town
Where the sun never reaches the ground
And seeing's not believing, the feeling stays alive
Yeah yeah
Little children laughing and playing
'Cause they haven't learned to start hating
Never giving up (Never giving up)
They still believe in love, sweet love

In a flash, the feeling can hit you
After all the times that it's missed you
Reaching deep inside to find your secret heart
Yeah, yeah
Look around, you'll notice you're flying
And for once, you're not even trying
City lights below you like a million tiny stars

In the poorest part of town
Where the sun never reaches the ground
And seeing's not believing, the feeling stays alive
Yeah yeah
Little children laughing and playing
'Cause they haven't learned to start hating
Never giving up
They still believe in love, sweet love

In a flash, the feeling can hit you
After all the times that it's missed you
Reaching deep inside to find your secret heart
Yeah, yeah
Look around, you'll notice you're flying
And for once, you're not even trying
City lights below you like a million tiny stars

In the poorest part of town
Where the sun never reaches the ground
And seeing's not believing, the feeling stays alive
Yeah yeah
Little children laughing and playing
'Cause they haven't learned to start hating
Never giving up
They still believe in love, sweet love
