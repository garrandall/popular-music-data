Sister, sister, sister
Sister, sister, sister
What's goin' on
What's goin' on
What's goin' on
What's goin' on
Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying
Brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today
Father, father
We don't need to escalate
War is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some loving here today
Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me so you can see
What's goin' on
Oh, what's going on
What's goin' on
What's goin' on
Yeah, what's goin' on
What's goin' on
What's goin' on
What's goin' on
