Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

You've got some vacation time
You and your girlfriend too bad mind
Bad, bad, bad, when you're both combined
I don't know why you look so nice

Girl you're not nice, you're rude
Want me to feel like I'm new
Want me to watch you do you
Don't, gal, you look so nice
But you're not nice, you're rude
Look what you're putting me through
I'd never do this to you

I need to hold the corner and then slow whine it
One time yeah
I need to hold the corner and then slow whine it
One time yeah

You a real bad gal weh no tek back chat an anything you say you can defend that too!

And you gwahn bad, bad, bad when I treat you right
I don't care how you look so nice

Girl you're not nice, you're rude
Want me to feel like I'm new
Want me to watch you do you
Don't, gal, you look so nice
But you're not nice, you're rude
Look what you're putting me through
I'd never do this to you

I need to hold the corner and then slow whine it
One time yeah
I need to hold the corner and then slow whine it
One time yeah

You a real bad gal weh no tek bad chat an anything you say you can defend that too!

But you're not nice, not nice, not nice...
