Be sure to treat him like a king
Sitting on his throne
Don't be a fool like me
Is just too late

If you got a good guy, it's a fact
To keep you on the right track

Girls are out to get you
Girls are out to get you

One bird in the hand is better
Than two in the bush, so they say
True love is so hard to find
I know it is so
Now that he's no longer mine

There's a? figure so nice
Remember opportunity never knocks twice

Girls are out to get you
Girls are out to get you, yeah

One bird in the hand is better
Than two in the bush, so they say
True love is so hard to find
And I know it is so
Now that he's no longer mine

There's a? figure so nice
Remember opportunity never knocks twice

Girls are out to get you
Girls are out to get you
Don't wait til it's too late
Watch out...
