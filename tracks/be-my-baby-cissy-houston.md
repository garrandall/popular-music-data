The night we met
I knew I, I needed you so
And if I had the chance
I would never, never let you go

So please won't you say you love me
Somehow I'll make you so proud of me
We'll make them turn their heads
Yes, we will, every place we go

So be my baby
(Be my, be my baby)
Be my baby
(My one and only baby)
Say you'll be my darling
(Be my, be my baby)
Be my baby now

Oh, oh, oh, someday
I'll make you happy, baby
You just wait and see
And for every kiss you give me
I'm gonna give you three

Since the first day I saw you
I have been waiting for you
I'll always adore you
And I'll love you
Right through eternity

So please be my baby
(Be my, be my baby)
I gotat have you for my baby
(My one and only baby)
Say you'll be my darling
(Be my, be my baby)
Be my baby now

Don't wait
I need you to be my baby
(Be my, be my baby)
Won't you be my baby please
(My one and only baby)
Oh, oh, oh, be my darling
(Be my, be my baby)
Be my baby now

All right now
I need you, I need you
I need you to be my baby
(Be my, be my baby)
I need you to be my baby
Yes, I do
(My one and only baby)
(Be my, be my baby)
I wanna have you for my darling
It's got to be right now
Right now, right now

I need you, yes, I do

(Be my, be my baby)
I'm telling you, I need you
(My one and only baby)
Don't you know I need you
For my baby, yes, I do
(Be my, be my baby now)
Oh, oh, right now

All I can say is I want you
I got to have you
(Be my, be my baby)...
