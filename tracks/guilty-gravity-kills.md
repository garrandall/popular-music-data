This isnât easy
Easy to notice
That weâre stalling
And Iâm getting on your nerves
This isnât last year
When we were both happy
That weâll get what we deserve
(This is moving a mountain)
But itâs trying our best
(It's me losing control)
As youâre getting undressed
This is a wake up call
Wake up to all that weâve ever loved...
And give it up

Donât turn away
This time could be different
Youâre making this difficult
Just thought I let you know
That when you leave
Iâll be starting a new life on my own

'Cause itâs a constant tragedy
Connecting you and I
And I laugh when I hear you say:
"I want to feel alive
I want to be with you one more night
Just you and I
And the city lights
Weâll do it one more time
Except this time weâll get it right"

Iâve got my subtleties
That distinguish me from all the liars
'Cause I always satisfy her
When she says she says:
"Give me my fix, just gimmie my fix"
You want me to
Now weâre a one way street
And Iâm just gravity
They canât stop tearing down our dreams
(To every moment that Iâm burning alive)
I used to think you cared
But tonight I realize...

'Cause itâs a constant tragedy
Connecting you and I
And I laugh when I hear you say:
"I want to feel alive
I want to be with you one more night
Just you and I
And the city lights
Weâll do it one more time
Except this time weâll get it right"

(Get it right, get it right, let me go...)

I donât think I need you now
Cause I donât want you
I donât want to see you

(I'm gonna haunt your dreams
like a fucking nightmare,
Iâm watching you)

I bet, bet we forget
Forget everything this year
Iâm making sure we donât speak a word
Cuz lately youâre finding brand new ways to hate me
I bet, bet we forget
Forget everyone this time
Things canât be undone
You cover up so easy
But, twenty bucks says youâre guilty now

(You're guilty, you're guilty now)

So I give up 
and I give in 
And if Iâm lucky youâll fade away
(Just fade away)
Well won't you fade away? 

'Cause itâs a constant tragedy
Connecting you and I
(Just fade away)
And I laugh when I hear you say:
"I want to feel alive
I want to be with you one more night
Just you and I
And the city lights
Weâll do it one more time
Except this time weâll get it right"
