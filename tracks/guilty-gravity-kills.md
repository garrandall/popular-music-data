Behind closed doors, your words ring hollow
What you said they'd be
What behavior? Who are you?
But I like it

Now I'm done with nothing new
Sometimes green and sometimes blue
And I'm guilty
And I'm guilty
And I'm guilty
And I'm guilty
And you're guilty too

Hey, hey, hey, I'm guilty
And you're guilty too
Hey, hey, hey, hey

I'll tell you something, something new
You're hearing nothing, nothing true
You're killing me, I'm killing you
And I'm guilty too

One, two, three
I found you out so easily
One, two, three
I found in you what I found in me

The time is wrong, the time is right
Be careful who you kill tonight
And I'm melting
And I'm melting
And I'm melting
And I'm melting
And I'm melting in you

Hey, hey, hey, I'm guilty
And you're guilty too
Hey, hey, hey, hey

One and one and one makes three
One and one, why don't you see?
I'm killing you, you're killing me
Can't you set me free?

Inside out, I can't describe it
What you do to me
Inside out, I cannot hide it
Looking right through me

Now I've reached the living end
Pointing fingers to defend
And I'm guilty
And I'm guilty
And I'm guilty
And I'm guilty
And you're guilty too

Hey, hey, hey, I'm guilty
And you're guilty too
Hey, hey, hey, hey

I'll tell you something, something new
You're hearing nothing, nothing true
You're killing me, I'm killing you
And I'm guilty too
