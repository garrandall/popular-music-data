You leave the light on at your door
You cross your heart
Across the bedroom floor
And through the window
To your world
You can feel me there
And you know I'm waiting
You taste the words
Of my forbidden kiss
Our eyes connect
And we both know what this is
I will be your keeper
You possess the key
Forget me not
Forget me not
Cause you belong to me
I will be your shadow
When you walk away
Forget me not
Forget me not
I will follow you
Until your dying day
Oh yeah
Oh
A thousand lifetimes long ago
We made a promise
We would not let go
And so I come for you tonight
And we live again
Before we lose each other
I climb a stairway to the open sky
You are my universe
I won't be denied no
I will be your keeper
You possess the key
Forget me not
Forget me not
Cause you belong to me
I will be your shadow
When you walk away
Forget me not
Forget me not
I will follow you
Until your dying day
Yeah
Oh yeah
When I touch you
You will be touched by love
(touched by love by love by love)
I climb the stairway to your world
You can feel me there
And you know I'm waiting
I will be your keeper
You possess the key
Forget me not
Forget me not
Cause you belong to me
I will be your shadow
When you walk away
Forget me not
Forget me not
I will follow you
Until your dying day
Forget me not
Forget me not
Cause baby you belong day
Oh yeah
(forget me not)
(forget me not)
You're everything I see
(forget me not)
(forget me not)
And baby you belong to me
You're mine
No no no no no
(forget me not)
(forget me not)
Baby baby baby baby
You belong to me
(forget me not)
(forget me not)
Cause baby you belong to me
Oh yeah
(forget me not)
(forget me not)
(forget me not)
