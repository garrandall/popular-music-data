Ah ah...
You're gonna say you'll kiss me
You're gonna say you'll miss me
Well you're gonna say you'll love me
'Cause I'm-a gonna love you too
I don't care what you told me
You're gonna say you'll hold me
Well you're gonna say you'll love me
'Cause I'm-a gonna love you too
After all another fella took you
But I still can't overlook you
I'm gonna do my best to hook you
After all is said and done
I don't care what you told me
You're gonna say you'll hold me
Well you're gonna say you'll love me
'Cause I'm-a gonna love you too
You're gonna tell me sweet things
You're gonna see my heart sing
Well you're gonna make those bells ring
'Cause I'm-a gonna love you too
After all another fella took you
But I still can't overlook you
I'm gonna do my best to hook you
After all is said and done
I don't care what you told me
You're gonna say you'll hold me
Well you're gonna say you'll love me
Well I'm-a gonna love you too
You're gonna tell me sweet things
You're gonna hear those bells ring
Well you're gonna hear my heart sing
'Cause I'm-a gonna love you too
After all another fella took you
But I still can't overlook you
I'm gonna do my best to hook you
After all is said and done
Ah ah...
Ah ah...
