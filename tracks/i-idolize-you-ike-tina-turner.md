If you want some loving
That I can give to you
And if you want some hugging
Said I can hug some, too

All I want, baby, now
Is some thought of you

And just a little of your affection
You know, will see me through

'cause you know that you are my man
And I want you to forever be mine
I idolize you (yes, she idolize you)
