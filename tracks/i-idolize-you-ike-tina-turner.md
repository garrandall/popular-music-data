If you want some lovin' babe
I can give it to you
And if you want some huggin' babe
I can hug some too

All I want baby
Is some part of you
Just a little bit attention
You know, will see me through

Because you know that you're my kind
And I'll tell you baby one more time
Woo I idolize you

I would like to make love to you babe
When the lights are gone low
And I would like to sing to you babe
Just to let you know

All I want baby
Is some part of you
Just a little bit attention
You know, will see me through

Because you know that you're my kind
And I want you to be mine
Woo I idolize you

If you want me I'll be close to you babe
I'll have you by my side
Yes I'm in love with you babe
I have nothing to hide

Cause all I want baby
A small part of you
Just a little bit attention
Gonna see me right through

Because you know that you're my kind
And I want you forever to be mine
Woo I idolize you

If you want me to hold you babe
Underneath the moonlight
And you want me to squeeze you babe
Make you feel alright

Cause all I want baby
Is some part of you
Just a little bit attention
You know, will see me through

Girl you know that you're my kind
And I want you to be mine
Woo I idolize you

If you want some lovin' babe
I can give it to you
And if you want some huggin' babe
I can hug some too

All I want baby
Is some part of you
Just a little bit attention
You know, will see me through

Girl you know that you're my kind
And I want you forever to be mine
Woo I idolize you

Yeah I idolize you
Yeah I idolize you baby
Yeah I idolize you baby
