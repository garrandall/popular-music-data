I'm dancing with Johnny, but looking at Jim,
And praying, "Oh please make him jealous!".
my arms around Johnny, my heart's around Jim,
But nothing I do seems to matter to him!

Now Jimmy is dancing with Molly McGee,
And golly, it's me who's so jealous!
And I'm so ashamed of the tear in my eye,
As Jim dances carelessly by.

And I'm so ashamed of the tear in my eye,
As Jim dances carelessly by.
