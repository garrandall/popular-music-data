Hey Bobby, why do you like soul food?
Because it makes me ... ha-a-a-py

Pass the peas, like we used to say
Pass the peas, like we used to say
Pass the peas, like we used to say
Pass the peas, like we used to say

Pass 'em then!

Come on now!

(Trombone solo)

Pass the peas
Pass the peas
Pass the peas
Pass the peas
Pass the peas
Pass the peas
Pass the peas
Pass the peas
Pass the peas
Pass the peas
Pass the peas
Pass the peas
