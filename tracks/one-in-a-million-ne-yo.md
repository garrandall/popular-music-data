Jet-setter
Go-getter
Nothing better

Call me Mr. Been There Done That
Top-model chick to your every-day 'hood rat
Less than all but more than a few
But I've never met one like you

Been all over the world
Done a little bit of everything
Little bit of everywhere
With a little bit of everyone

But all the girls I've been with
Things I've seen
It takes much to impress
But sure enough your glow
It makes your soul
Stand out from all the rest

Baby, I could be in love
But I just don't know (don't know, girl)
Baby, one thing is for certain
Whatever you do it's working

Other girls don't matter
In your presence
Can't do what you do
There's a million girls around
But I don't see no one but you

Girl, you're so one in a million
You are
Baby, you're the best I ever had
Best I ever had
And I'm certain that
There ain't nothing better
No, there ain't nothing better than this

You're not a regular girl
You don't give a damn about the loot
Talking about I can't do for you
What you can't do for yourself

Even though that ain't so
Baby, 'cause my dough don't know how to end
But that independent thingâI'm with it
All we do is win, baby

I could be in love
But I just don't know (I don't know, girl)
Baby one thing is for certain
Whatever you do it's working

Other girls don't matter
In your presence
Can't do what you do
There's a million girls around
But I don't see no one but you

Baby, you're so one in a million
You are
Baby, you're the best I ever had
Best I ever had
And I'm certain that
There ain't nothing better
No, there ain't nothing better than this

Baby, you're so one in a million
You are (say, you are)
Baby, you're the best I ever had
Best I ever had
And I'm certain that
There ain't nothing better
No, there ain't nothing better than this

Diamond girl
Only one in the world
Just one of a kind
She mine

Ooh, all that I can think about
Is what this thing could be a future, baby
Baby, you're one of a kind
That means that you're the only one for me
Only one for me

Baby girl, you're so one in a million
You are
Baby, you're the best I ever had
(You're the best I ever had)
Best I ever had
And I'm certain that
There ain't nothing better
No, there ain't nothing better than this

Girl, you're so one in a million
You are
Baby, you're the best I ever had
Best I ever had
And I'm certain that
There ain't nothing better
No, there ain't nothing better than this
