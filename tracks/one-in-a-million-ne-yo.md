Jet setter, go getter
Nothing better
Call me Mr. Been There, Done That
Top model chick to your every day hood rat
Less than all but more than a few
But I've never met one like you


Been all over the world, done a little bit of everything
Little bit of everywhere, with a little bit of everyone
All the girls I've been with, things I've seen, it takes much to impress
But sure nuff your glow it makes your soul stand out from all the rest baby


I can be in love
But I just don't know
Don't know
Baby one thing is for certain
Whatever you do it's working
Other girls don't matter in your presence can't do what you do
There's a million girls around but I don't see no one but you


Girl you're so one in a million
You are
Baby you're the best I ever had
Best I ever had
And I'm certain that
There ain't nothing better
No there ain't nothing better than this


You're not a regular girl, you don't give a damn about the loot
Talking about I can't do it for you but you can do it for yourself
Even though that ain't so, baby cause my dough don't know how to end
But that independent thing, I'm with it, all we do is win, baby


I can be in love
But I just don't know
Don't know
Baby one thing is for certain
Whatever you do it's working
Other girls don't matter in your presence can't do what you do
There's a million girls around but I don't see no one but you


Girl you're so one in a million
You are
Baby you're the best I ever had
Best I ever had
And I'm certain that
There ain't nothing better
No there ain't nothing better than this
Girl you're so one in a million
You are
Baby you're the best I ever had
Best I ever had
And I'm certain that
There ain't nothing better
No there ain't nothing better than this


Diamond girl
Only one in the world
Just one of a kind
She mine
Oh all that I can think about is what this thing could be
A future baby
Baby you're one of a kind
That means that you're the only one for me
Only one for me
Baby...


Girl you're so one in a million
You are
Baby you're the best I ever had
Best I ever had
And I'm certain that
There ain't nothing better
No there ain't nothing better than this
Girl you're so one in a million
You are
Baby you're the best I ever had
Best I ever had
And I'm certain that
There ain't nothing better
No there ain't nothing better than this
