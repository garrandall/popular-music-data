You old fire, I'm mad with desire
You're my favorite one
You got me cookin' with the fever
Got my love runnin' for the sun
Uh, huh, runnin' for the sun

I feel so high, I feel like I may
Go blowin' away blowin' away
Blow, blow, blowin' away

My well meaner, my day fancy dreamer
Oh, what can it be?
Well, it's somethin' like a power
Like a hold, and it's holdin' me
Uh, huh, and it's holdin' me

I feel so high, I feel like I may
Go blowin' away blowin' away
Blow, blow, blowin' away
Blow, blow, blowin' away

My long laster, my soft hearted master
Ain't been born and bred
But he's standin' in my doorway, in my mind
Up above my, up above, up above my head
Up above my head, up above my head

I feel so high, I feel like I may
Go blowin' away, blowin' away
Blowin' away, blowin' away, blowin' away
Blow, blow, blowin' away

Blow, blow, blowin' away
Blow, blow, blowin' away
Blow, blow, blowin' away
