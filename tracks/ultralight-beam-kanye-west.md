We're on that ultralight beam, that ultralight beam
This is everything
We're on that ultralight beam, that ultralight beam
This is everything, it's everything

I'm tryna keep my faith, but I'm looking for more
It's holy war, it's holy war
I'm tryna keep my faith, but I'm looking for more
It's holy war, it's holy war

We're on that ultralight beam, ultralight beam, baby
This is everything
We're on that ultralight beam, ultralight beam
It's everything

Foot on the devil and I move with my family to Zambia
My daughter looks just like Sia, you can't see her

I'm just having fun with this
Know I'm feeling so lost

Laugh in my head maybe my ex looking back like a pillar of salt

Now we're on that ultralight beam, ultralight beam baby
It's everything
We're on that ultralight beam, ultralight beam
It's everything

I'm just having fun with this, know I've been feeling so lost
Laugh in my head I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt

And now we're on that ultralight beam, ultralight beam baby
It's everything
