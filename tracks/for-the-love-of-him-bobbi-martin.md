Has anybody here seen my old friend Abraham
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed a lot of people but the good they die young
I looked around one day and he was gone
Oh, he was gone

Has anybody here seen my old friend Martin
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed a lot of people but the good, they die young
I turned around one day and he was gone
He was gone

Has anybody here seen my old friend John
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed a lot of people but the good, they die young
I turned around one day and he was gone
Oh, he was gone

Didn't you love the things they stood for
Didn't they try to find some good for you and me
Oh, we'll be free
Someday soon it's gonna be, it's gonna be one day

Has anybody here seen my old friend Bobby
Can you tell me where he's gone?
I thought I saw him walking up over the hill
With old man Abraham, I believe I saw Martin and his brother John
