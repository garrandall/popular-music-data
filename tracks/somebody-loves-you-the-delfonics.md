Somebody loves you, girl
This I swear is true, girl

So you think no one cares, oh boy
What a down thing to think of
And if you give me a chance
(If you give me a chance)
I will give you true love

And every day I watch you
I just can't do without you
You're so doggone pretty
I got to have you and I've gotta say

Somebody loves you, girl
This I swear is true, girl
Somebody loves you, girl
This I swear is true, girl

Now that you understand
(Now that you understand)
Won't you please take my hand?

And let us now fall in love
(Let us now fall in love)
You're the one I always dream of

And every day I watch you
I just can't do without you
You're so doggone pretty
I got to have you and I've gotta say

Somebody loves you, girl
This I swear is true, girl
Somebody loves you, girl
This I swear is true, girl

You're so beautiful
I'm saying words that's, oh, so true
Look at me, baby
Somebody loves

And every day I watch you
I just can't do without you
You're so doggone pretty
I got to have you and I've gotta say

Somebody loves you, girl
This I swear is true, girl
Somebody loves you, girl
This I swear is true, girl

Oh, oh, oh
Somebody loves you, girl
This I swear is true, girl
