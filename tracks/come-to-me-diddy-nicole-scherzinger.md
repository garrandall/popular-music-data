It's Bad Boy bitch
Do it do it do it do it
Do it do it do it do it
(It feels good to be back, I missed ya)
Relax your mind, let your conscience be free
And I roll with the sounds of BBE
Do it do it do it do it
Do it do it do it do it
(You know what time it is)
(Report to the dance floor)
It's bad boy bitch
(Talk to 'em)


See you out the corner of my eye
Leaning on the wall, looking fly
I want you to come be with me
You're the only one I wanna talk to
But I don't wanna rush


I'm here when will you make your move?
I see you, eyeing me, I want you, why don't you?
Come to me, I can be, what you need, uh baby
I'm standing, been waiting, I'm yearning, I'm burning
Get to know me, come and get to know me
Come to show me, that you wanna know me


You know who it is, I'm back in the building
Security strapped, still stacking a million
It's doubt with the stallion, somethin' Italian
Or maybe Puerto Rican, you can catch me in Paris
I'm in it to win it but willing to carry
The game, if you think I'm not look at the carats
I buck clean about in a Phantom
The people go screaming like an opera anthem
I did it before, do it again
I got to blow, gotta to spin
Lies before, cool as the wind
Got hits go back like juice and gin
Shine the best and diamond necklace
My extravagant taste, the style perplexes
They know I'm the ish, they wanna get next
That's why she had to fit cause she wanted to get next




Anywhere I appear, they all stop and stare
Admire your body language speaking loud and clear like
(I want you to come be with me)
She be waiting anticipating for oh so long
Fantasising wild thoughts of me coming on like
(I'm here when will you make your move)
She digging my style, my swag, my suede, my swerve
My way with words, the Boys absurd for sure
You can't fall 'til my aura called
I make miracles like I walk on water
What you want mama order, it's on my tab
I'm so bad with the cash, I dropped the whole bag
Where you at girl?




I'm here right now, can't wait no more no
You were the one who stole my heart
Can't you see the wait is over
I need you to come closer
Please believe is getting stormy
You really got me hot




Do it do it do it do it
Do it do it do it do it
Why don't you come to me
I can be, what you need uh baby
I'm here, you're here, let's make it happen
Do it do it do it do it
Do it do it do it do it
Relax your mind, let your conscience be free
And I roll with the sounds of BBE (Bad Boy Entertainment)
Do it, do it
You know what this is
It's Bad Boy bitch
Press Play!
