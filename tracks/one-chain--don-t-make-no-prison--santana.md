(D. Lambert/B. Potter)
Just because in a moment of madness
I took advantage of your sweet love
Don't just hand me a lifetime of sadness
'Cause there's so little of beauty

Oh baby, one chain don't make no prison
Two wrongs don't make no right
One rain don't make no river
One punch don't make no fight

Can't you spare me a little affection
Would that be asking too much of you
Don't point love in another direction
I swear I'll make it all up to you

Oh baby, one chain don't make no prison
Two wrongs don't make no right
One rain don't make no river
One punch don't make no fight
There's a bed I'm keeping room in for you
There's a lot I know I gotta do
Don't let as simple misunderstanding
Be a mountain that we can't move
Ooooh... one chain don't make no prison
Two wrongs don't make no right
One rain don't make no river
One punch don't make no fight

One chain don't make no prison
Two wrongs don't make no right
One rain don't make no river
One punch don't make no fight
