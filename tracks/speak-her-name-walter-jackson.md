Crypt just called he said he's lookin' to scrap
He wanted GAWNE up on the track because I murder the raps
Well yo, Crypt homie' just know that I got your back
Even if I gotta be a lyrical bully to Dax
Just give me the orders' run up and kick your door in
Hit 'em with fifty mortars' rigor mortis
Kill 'em and leave their corpses on other people's doorsteps
Enter the morgue with venom and then I get morbid
Evil and horrid, imminent torture
Reapin' the organs outta the orphans
Bodily portions, gotta be foreskins
And now they like whoa
How the fuck he spit and just murder so many flows?
I don't know' I was bred for this shit since '96
Makin' hits since an embryo, I been the G.O.A.T.
I could do flippity hippity enterin' in the vicinity
Cookin' up hits like I'm Breaking Bad
Walter White Jessie when makin' amphetamines
Shits gettin' messy I'm finna be killin' the enemy
Never see any serenity
When I be mentally heavily off of the Hennessy
Sippin' the liquor I lick it up lickety split and my liver then kick in
With a little bit of venom and I'm never gonna let up
Got to get up from the bottom
Put the motherfuckin' pedal to the metal
When In my head I'm goin' mental
In retrospect I probably should check my stress
But I'm never gonna second guess this shit it's over I won
This beat is OJ's wife by the time that I'm done


Moxas
Yeah, check
Okay the SoundCloud superhero back again
I train hard so when I'm on the track I'm overlappin' them
I'm lightin' up a sack' the holy pack, my only sacrament
No California though I took the O it's on my back again
They prolly don't get it, I'ma hit them with a chrome in it
Semi automatic flow I gotta get it though I'm kickin' in the door with it
Like oh shit it's the dope kid with the flow so sick oh no sis
And to be frank no ocean, got the weed dank and a potion
When I'm fleet flank feelin' focused, on my fee fie fum foe shit
And I speak fire if I wrote shit, so the fees high you ain't know shit
Can't afford it and I'm not nice, I'ma mmm mmm like I got lice
If you cop verse I will not write, and I got slime like a stop sigh ugh
I'm goin' up that's the reason that they've been sad lately
You a loud annoyin' little kid you a Bhad Bhabie
Got up on this beat to have some fun you know I'm showin' out
If a pussy come at me Alinity I'll throw 'em out


I think this girl better back off
She lookin' at me with some bright hopes
Tell her that she can be tied down
If she wanna walk on a tight rope
Hittin' that shit from the back dog
She probably gonna need Geico
She knows that my pockets are so fat
They probably gonna need lipo
Bitch I made a quarter mil' and y'all ignored until
I started murderin' these beats, I need some more to kill
Now my pockets lookin' green they gettin' chlorophilled
It's written in my destiny I'm born to kill
So much caffeine in my system that it's hard for me to concentrate
Shittin' on my competition, rappers lookin' constipated
I never been a dick don't need to over compensate
That's why all these women hit me tryna over populate
While labels scared to hit me 'cause I got way too much leverage
If I signed to them then I'm the one that's bringin' benefits
The amount they'd have to give's a mountain like it's Everest
Once that contract's in possession y'all gon' need an exorcist, I'm ghost


Yeah, God, God, God
Oh lawd the most slept on on the site nigga
In a different pedigree dog I show my bite bigger
Worried 'bout a diskile bar I dislike your life
On a knee lettin' it ring like I'm lookin' for a wife nigga
Brought a coffin heard you jackin' a box
Try to wind me somethin' poppin' like a jack in the box
The arms strong toss a molotov from a mile away
I son y'all but I didn't get a fuckin' gift on Father's Day
Oh y'all want action 'til I'm up and blastin'
Fuckin' tragic suckas plastic
Get your surface bursted for your bubble rappin'
Rounds of applause from the rounds of the ones I'm clappin'
Channels for reactions now reactin' to your fuckin' passin'
Thanos snappin' snatchin' the clout that you niggas gained
But a lot of y'all gon' vanish if the algorithm change
Who want smoke? I'ma alter your appearance
None you mothafucka's nice
Tell KSI that I'm actually Beerus, gawd


To all the people that say I'm the bomb
I'm gonna blow up that's what I'm made for
Lookin' for flow or lookin' for bars
'Cause I'ma give you what you came for
I get the blame for murder
You are just fake with burners what are you fake for?
You fake gangs ain't plugged in like Dax with his chainsaw
It's barology welcome to the classroom
Shaq you better tell Ja to stay inside that bathroom
Like Scriptwork we fight back
Man you ought to know
Like the Vatican with out the Pope
I want all the smoke
Hi there, I'm DK, I'm new here
I'm the guy with the English accent
Or the dickhead with the blue hair, that's me
I'm a vet already I be puttin' rappers in the cemetery
Leave them dead and buried like woah
Comin' harder than the military
I'm back on my bullshit with a full clip
Got a space in the morgue if you wanna talk shit
Got orchids for your funeral and a full zipped
Body bag they won't find out where the corpse is
I'll always be myself with no apologies
DKRapArtist, everybody go and follow me


Yo Crypt wanna thanks for the opportunity
Cyphers and freestyles is nothin' new to me
I do it beautifully
A couple verses up my sleeve I love nudity
And black bitches I'm the match when your wrist flicks it
Throw that ass back like a grenade and blow my dick up
Unpredictable with verses like Tourettes or havin' hiccups
Look, they compare ya boy to that of a lighter
Who's harder than a sniper hittin' through the chest on a Bible
Don't have any rivals 'cause that would imply I fight for survival
Amidst all the rappers I jack up it's easy now back up
Callin' for backup while I got they back up against the wall
Got my Vans up against they balls, pause
I ain't mean it like that dog
And I ain't homophobic
For a mil' I'd get some head behind a Kroger
If the deal was just a minute then it's over
Yeah I'm mad buggin'
Slap you up in public in your city ho
Only time you slap is the publish button on videos
Nigga we mop floors with rappers this no hyperbole
Flippin' them vertically
For badly attackin' with words that they murmerin'
My pen is catchin' bodies call it John Wick
I feel it as I am jottin' stretchin' these words like pilates
I kick quick karate
Ya click this ya noddin'
Ya spit shit the potty
A thick bitch I'm throbbin'
Bitch I'm finna nut huh
Dick up in her gut, I eat that booty like it's lunch


Yo yo yo yo, it's the girl about to rap
Huh, yeah, you know I'm on the fuck that
Been ready to fuck the game and use these rappers as my cum rag
'Cause listenin' to y'all is like pressin' on a thumbtack
And these rappers they itchin' for the clout
Snitchin' for the fame
You know that it's a snake if you just listen for the
And I'ma be givin' them halos
When I be trigger fingerin' these flows
Leavin' them quakin' and all on their toes
This is my destiny and what I chose look
I'm the best so all these muthafuckers hate me
If I press the side of this gat then there ain't gon' be no safety
Ain't no scopin'
I'ma put this chrome to your windows aim
And click click click like the fuckin' page won't open
These little rappers know there ain't no jokin
No hehe, no haha, jaja
It don't matter which language spoken
I vanquish these angry faces who try to steal my focus
My staff with me I pass the seas like I'm the real life Moses


Ah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Hold up
I done made some enemies
Up like the son you are a kid to me
Fake niggas wearin' disguises like it's trick or treat
I will never freeze on the beat
Control-Alt-Delete
That's why I went to work as soon as Crypt sent me the beat
Like I can read the signs and see the future like a Zodiac
Leave them where they stand I'm like James Harden with a step back
Linin' up the competition I will always catch them
One hand and defended like I'm O'Dell Beckham
Different rules you play with us then homie you gonna lose
Fade to black and you couldn't see us even with Google maps
And I know I knew
You just be hatin' use it for motivation
Kill ya from the sickness like a doctor 'cause you're so impatient
I wanna keep it real with you
I am just not satisfied by a mil' or two
So I only share the plate with a chosen few
If this a five star meal you a frozen food


Listen
A wild beast is let loose in the forest
You screwin' yourself like Darth Vader masturbatin' using the Force
Now congratulate this dude he's a boss
Try me, I will embarrass you like soccer moms doin' the floss
Check out my switch mag
Get a Glock put a Joy-Con where the clip at
And when you twitch I'll be screamin' at the chat to clip that
Flows tight by know my screws is loose
I'm Samuel Jackson of this YouTube rappin'
Grabbin' my super suit
My lines got a nice ring to 'em barbells
My name carry weight in the community cartels
I makin' a mil' off of rappin' no cappin' and I am not wearin' no VVS
I got so many rhymes my rap sheet is longer than a receipt at a CVS
It's finna go down better go now
'Bout to hit 'em with a four pound better know now
I ain't talkin' about guns just talkin' about bars
Don't really wanna be the one to slow down
Bodied the beat
Draw the chalk lines on the instrumental, zip it up
Now I can crush up the Infinity Stones into powder then sniff it up


Aw man, haha
I'm the sergeant of all my squadrons
This is all out war
I'll make you sprint like the phone
I'm not the one to call out boy
And my foes is more then hoes
Them bros is all out whores
Time to dead you
Pop with the metal make you fallout boy
Fuck all that noise
'Cause now I'm in this bitch like ya mother
See Crypt is my brother
Talk slick I'll make a crypt for your brother
My nigga I've suffered
But you won't hear me bitch like the others
You think they your brothers
But you can hear them hiss with they hug ya
You slick motherfuckers
Gon' end up in a ditch when I'm done
Got a problem them bite your tongue
That's called a bitch where I'm from
A Sig is a gun
Want smoke I'll put that shit in your lungs
Turn me to a serial killer
And you Cinnamon Crunch
My niggas is ummm
Young and goin' dumb with the drum
March for a band that little drummer boy pa-rum-pa-pum-pum
For a lump sum
They shootin' like the Rucker dumb dumb
Now you M.I.A. like "Paper Planes" and "Bucky Done Gun"
Duck, or down goes Donald
A clown like Ronald
If I was black then so is the strap
Brraatt the Tom like MacDonald
They asked me why I made all these bars about clappin' people
Grew up on battle rap plus I showed you mac is lethal
No class in people but I'm gradin' like professors
Throw you in a lake and now you really wavey like Quadeca
Tried to run but I'ma catch him
See the scope can make it long range
Rifle got the magnifyin' glasses
I am Dontai
A short temper can really make it a long day
And tell Crypt that I'm sorry I took the long way
Hahahaha


Oh, oh, yeah
They like he finally entered
I guess it's time to be bitter
I'm on every track like a parental advisory sticker
In a new league
They tryin' to keep me from gettin' too hot
I got spice so I'm gettin' my bleu cheese
I cannot be measured so I am unruly
You can't get through me
I'm an IUD to all of these pussies
You know I'm gonna win it
In the end I need my rupees
Huh, they never understand how I do it
Said I couldn't say an S so I drew a line through it
Like hi stupid
My rhymes are too fly they defy Newton
They all rushin' tryna do as much work as what I put in
I'm Putin, I'm puttin' so you know nobody else is on par
Stoppin' in the tracks when I drive in like I'm a cop car
Fuck rap shit I got bars but look like a pop star
Look like the Buzzfeed intern who gets employees their Pop Tarts
Instead I toy with the top charts now they heard of me
An emergin' MC
But you ain't got the M's
So you just an emergin' C
Get it


Yo, yeah, ayy, uhh, shit damn son
You've never seen a fuckin' rapper who be this handsome
I never breathe when I be rappin' I got six damn lungs
I'm at the offices of UMG with twin hand guns
I got a hostage I'ma shoot, I'll need a big ransom
I been recordin' like a Demogorgon
That'll rip your organs out and chop you into sixty portions
Like I'm Lizzie Borden, just a bit of boredom
Got me breakin' brick and boards
And I'ma smash your pumpkin like I'm Billy Corgan
And in a tournament I'm insubordinate
I'll throw you in the city morgue
And you'll just shiver morbidly with chilly organs
When performin' I mix endorphins with liquid morphine
The shit be coursin' through my veins
I went to war with 50 horseman
Drop to your knees and kiss my foreskin
Your jam ain't impress us
Jump off the cage and kick you in the face like Anthony Pettis
I roll heads back you flows just wack
I'll never die, I'm makin' videos forever
Call me NoDeathShaq
I commit homicide like this
I get three copyright strikes quick
So tell Susan Wochsoioskski
Whatever the fuck that bitches name is
She can demonetize my dick
A lethal with the straight facts
Y'all are just a needle in a haystack
Your rap looks old
You proudly ran that shit through FaceApp
Prolly thinkin' shit is sweet and I'ma beat you up on camera
Like fuckin' ASAP Rocky copy


I copy Mac, get bodied like Tommy Mac
With tsunami raps my flow is so immaculate
They think it's a magic act
I'm makin' these rappers mad
I'll make a diss appear then they disappear
With Nato on the beat and everybody here
Cypher of the year
Let's view inside my mind
And see what things we find and discover
No rapper better than I so
Take ya pick I'll leave 'em shuddered
No exposure needed for my focus to show my light
I'll ram my way in the game with my shows
I'm hungry so my gig a bite
I'll snap in a flash
Red is the only color I see whenever I'm lookin' at you
Stompin' they ass
Kickin' them motherfuckers when they are down like Ndamukong Suh
Rappers don't get mad at me, that's something you'll regret
I'll have you nervously persperatin' over this beat like meat sweats
Rap is a house and bitch I am high up in it
Call me a rap addict bitch the sky is not the limit
Roll up on me and get smoked, yo fuck your drama
I'm crackin' skulls in this joint, I call that blunt force trauma
And much more commas
Won't make me rap with you I'm immortal
Make you and your hoe go ghost
'Cause I know you just a pair of normals
I'm sick when spittin' that's the difference between you and me
I'm me, but you wanna copyright like UMG
Wait, you thought that was it
Crypt is in this bitch and bitch you know I gotta spit it quick
So everybody come and listen up
I gotta tell you what the fuck we gonna do to go and fuckin' rip it up
Yo, switch it up, everybody fearin' when we hit it up
Ryan Oakes knows his flow was different
'Cause Mac is Lethal
Packin' gats in his rap shootin' back at people
Actin' wack in fact Nems raps are regal
Lex Bratcher is it reppin' for the chicks
And Dontai can spit and six way to represent
Luke spit so quick I can't even comprehend
Devvon Terrell with the voice of an angel
Scru done proved his spot at the table
And DK reppin' UK
He won the competition and now he's here to stay
Moxas put them in a coffin
And Quad spazzed there's no question
My shirt size is XXL but fuck bein' a freshman


Who made this beat? Nato
