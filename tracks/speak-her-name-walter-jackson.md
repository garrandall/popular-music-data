Speak her name
And I get misty eyed
Yes, I get misty eyed
I miss my baby (baby, baby, baby)

Speak her name, speak her name
Oh, I begin to cry
Yes, I begin to cry
I miss my baby (baby, baby, baby)

It's got to end someday
I can't go on this way
Living in the past
Forget about the sorrow
And live for tomorrow
This is all I ask

I don't want no-one speakin' her name
All I want is to forget
I know I must forget
Oh, she's not my baby

No she's not my baby
Baby
I need you, my baby
(Yes he is, yes he is, yes he is)
I need you, my baby
(Yes he is, yes he is, yes he is)
I need you, my baby
(Yes he is, yes he is, yes he is)... fade
