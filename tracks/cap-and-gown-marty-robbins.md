Cap and gown...
You'll be so pretty in your cap and gown.
But I'd imagine it's a wedding gown,
On our graduation day.

On your head,
You're gonna wear a graduation ring.
But I'd imagine it's a wedding ring,
On our graduation day.

When they sing,
The alma mater,
I will sing along,
But a voice deep down inside me,
Will sing the wedding song.

I love you,
And if my graduation wish comes true,
What I imagine you'd imagine too,
On our graduation day.

When they sing,
The alma mater,
I will sing along,
But a voice deep down inside me,
Will sing the wedding song.

I love you,
And if my graduation wish comes true,
What I imagine you'd imagine too,
On our graduation day.
