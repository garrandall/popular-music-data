I know I believed in you I think to me
We are over now all the times we together
Let's go

Baby one more time
Let me blow your mind

Only fantasy shijakagesseo neol wihan showtime
Dalkomhan chocolate-cheoreom nogadeun naege ppajeo bwa

Pingkeubit lipstick-cheoreom seumyeodeun naege chwihae bwa

I know I believed in you I think to me
We are over now all the times we together
Let's go

Baby one more time
Let me blow your mind

Only fantasy, just for you, I'll start the showtime
Like sweet chocolate, indulge me, soft
With sexy stares and hot body language, come a little closer
Nasty wolves that are up all night, come hold me

Baby one more time (ooh yeah)
(Baby one more time)
Let me blow your mind (ooh yeah)
(Let me blow your mind woo)

Baby come to me, I can't handle it, your scent is toxic
Soaked like pink lipstick, get drunk on me
Fix my makeup, quench my thirst, all the people dancing
Sometimes tight, sometimes hot, take me away

Baby one more time (ooh yeah)
(Baby one more time)
Let me blow your mind (ooh yeah)
(Let me blow your mind woo)
Baby one more time

You can't stop me here
Release yourself from me
The chains around my heart
Inside a maze

We can take it slow (slow)
Any way you want to go (go)
I like this music, don't stop moving
Dance in to the night (come on)
We can take it slow (slow)
Any way you want to go (go)
I like this music, don't stop moving
Dance in to the night (yeah)

Baby one more time, don't stop me
So I can tempt these blissful times
Let me blow your mind
Hold me again, so it never stops

Baby one more time
Hit me boy (hit me boy)
Baby don't be shy (baby don't be shy)
Come by my side (woo uh)
Baby hold me tight
I wanna make you mine

Let me blow your mind
Hit me boy (hit me boy)
Baby don't be shy (baby don't be shy)
Come by my side
Baby hold me tight
I wanna make you mine
Baby one more time
