Pretty little girl
Standing on the corner
Waiting for the bus to come

Driving in my car
I waved, winked, and smiled
Boy, I bet she thinks I'm dumb

I've been around this block
About fifteen times
I really don't know what to do

'Cause you're so lovely
And I'm so lonely
I wish that I could talk to you

Hey, little girl
Waiting at the bus stop
You really know you're looking fine
Hey, little girl
You're looking kind of pretty
You know this isn't just a line

I said, hey, little girl
Standing at the corner
I'll go around just one more time
Hey, little girl
Standing at the corner
I'm gonna try to make you mine

Sweet young thing just
Standing at the bus stop
And I've got no place to go

For just one smile
I'd drive another mile
And take her to the picture show

I'm getting dizzy driving
Round this same old block
Please come along with me and play

Or I'll drive you straight home
Call you on the telephone
I know there's got to be a way

Hey, little girl
Waiting at the bus stop
You really know you're looking fine
I said, hey, little girl
You're looking kind of pretty
You know this isn't just a line

I said, hey, little girl
Standing at the corner
I'll go around just one more time
Can't you hear me now

Hey, little girl
Standing at the corner
I'm gonna try to make you mine
Come on, look at me

Hey, little girl
Waiting at the bus stop
You really know you're looking fine
I'll do it one more time

Hey, little girl
You're looking kind of pretty
You know this isn't just a line

I said, hey, little girl
Standing at the corner...
