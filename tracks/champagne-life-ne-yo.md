Yes, it was a beautiful day 
It's gone be a beautiful night 
Break out the champagne 
Everybody get a glass 
Let's start it off sexy 
What do you say? 

Uh, and all the ladies say (Uh-huh) 
Uh, and all the ladies say (Uh-huh) 
Think I like that 
Uh, and all the ladies say (Uh-huh) 

Welcome to the champagne life 
Where trouble is a bubble in a champagne glass 
Dreams and reality are one and the same 
And we gone do it like this (Oh) 

Got an addiction for life and this living 
Like everyday's my birthday, know what I'm getting 
And reserved for top notch that's where I'm sitting 
Me and my friends and found 6 Miss Independents (Independents) 
And my attitude's so chill and so breezy (breezy) 
My designer suit, I make this look easy (easy) 
Sexy baby, don't you dare act like you don't see me 
Baby, I know you see me 

It's all about them fast car nights and them big boat days 
Living this champagne life, everything's okay 
Let's toast it up (Wooh) 
Let's toast it up (Wooh) 

Said we play all night and we play all day 
Living this champagne life, everything's okay 
Let's toast it up (Whoo) 
Baby, let's toast it up (Whoo) 
Oh, champagne life 

Got penthouse property on cloud nine (Oh) 
I got the sun jealous 'cause the way I shine (Oh) 
And reserved for time 'cause that's how I do mine 
Nice meal and a good wine, definition of a good time 
I'm living out my dreams, watching them come true (come true) 
Baby, I'm a boss, I don't know what they do (they do) 
You've put down the ride, come on and I'll take you 
I know you want me to take you 

So if it's all about them fast car nights and them big boat days 
Living this champagne life, everything's okay 
Let's toast it up (Whoo) 
Everybody, let's toast it up (Whoo) 

Said because we play all night and we play all day 
Living this champagne life and everything's okay 
Let's toast it up (Whoo) 
Baby, let's toast it up (Whoo) 
Champagne life 

Uh, uh, hey, uh (Uh-huh) 
We don't even clap the same when we living that champagne life 
(Uh-huh) Sexier than a regular clap 
Oh, it's a party, reserved for top notch 
Let's bring it back 

Oh, said it's all about them fast car nights and them big boat days 
Living this champagne life, everything's okay 
So let's toast it up (Whoo) 
And everybody, let's toast it up (Whoo) 

Said 'cause we play all night and we play all day 
Living the champagne life, everything's okay 
Let's toast it up (Whoo) 
Baby, let's toast it up (Whoo)
