Had a dream, I was born to be naked in the eye of the storm
And now it's standing right in front of me
What's it going to do to me, who knows
Had a dream, it was time to be taken to the front of the line
Well that is not a place you wanna be
Sleeping with the enemy, you know


I don't care what the future brings, give a damn about anything
I'd be fine if they'd only leave me alone
But it's time, gotta take a stance 'cause I won't get a second chance
And I know now I have to make it alone


Had a dream it was war, and they couldn't tell me what it was for
But it was something they could lie about, something we could die about, you know
Anytime, anyplace when you look that man in the face
Well it is not a face you wanna see
Sleeping with the enemy, you know


Mary, can you hear me, can you tell me what it's all supposed to mean
Holding out a photograph of all that I have seen
I wish I could hold you, I wish I could hold you


Had a dream, it was time to be a witness at the scene of the crime
Well that is something you can analyze, something you can criticize, who knows
So we wait, hesitate and we're making such a mistake
Oh whatever can the matter be, sleeping with the enemy you know


I don't care what the future brings, give a damn about anything
I'd be fine if they'd only leave me alone
But it's time, gotta take a stance 'cause I won't get a second chance
And I know now I have to make it alone
