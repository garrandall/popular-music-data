Hey, baby
It's your Georgie Porgie
Knocking on your door

Hey, baby
It's your Georgie Porgie
Don't you love me anymore

Hey, baby
It's your Georgie Porgie
Let me tell you where I been

Hey, baby
It's your Georgie Porgie
I just knew you'd let me in

Hold everything, baby, baby
Please put down that gun
At least you've got to give
Old Georgie one last chance to run

Hey, baby
It's your Georgie Porgie
I'm too young to die

Hey, baby
It's your Georgie Porgie
It's your everloving guy

Hold everything, baby, baby
Please put down that gun
At least you've got to give
Old Georgie one last chance to run

Hey, baby
It's your Georgie Porgie
Don't you think I look sincere

Hey, baby
It's your Georgie Porgie
I'm getting out of here

I'm getting out of here
I got to get out of here
