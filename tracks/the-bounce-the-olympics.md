Well you know there's a dance
Goin around
In every city
Every town.
You need a little soul
About one ounce
To do the dance,
To do the dance,
To do the dance
Called the bounce.

You put your right foot out,
Your left one, too.
You listen here girl
What were gonna do.
You wiggle your knees
Round and round.
Now you're doin the dance,
You're doin the dance,
You're doin the dance
Called the bounce.

You put your hands in the air.
Bring them back.
Move your hair
To the Jimmy Mack.
You need a little soul,
About one ounce.
Now you're doin the dance,
Oh, the dance.
You're doin the dance,
Called the bounce.
Hey you're doin the dance.
You're doin the dance,
Hey, the dance,
Called the bounce.
