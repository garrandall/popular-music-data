Mama, you taught me to do the right things
So, now you have to let your baby fly
You've given me everything that I will need
To make it through this crazy thing called life
And I know you watch me grow up
And only want what's best for me
And I think I found the answer to your prayers

And he Is good, so good
He treats your little girl
Like a real man should
He is good, so good
He makes promises he keeps
No, he's never gonna leave
So, don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me

Mama, there's no way you'll ever lose me
Giving me away is not goodbye
As you watch me walk down to my future
I hope tears of joy are in your eyes

Cause, he is good, so good
And, he treats your little girl
Like a real man should
He is good, so good
He makes promises he keeps
No, he's never gonna leave
So, don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me

And when I watch my baby grow up
I'll only want what's best for her
And I hope she'll find
The answer to my prayers
And that she'll say

He is good, so good
And he treats your little girl
Like a real man should
He is good, so good
He makes promises he keeps
No, he's never gonna leave
So, don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me

Mama, don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me
