Mustang Sally, guess you better slow your Mustang down (what I said now)
Mustang Sally, now baby, guess you better slow your Mustang down (oh yeah)
You been running all over the town now
Oh! I guess I'll have to put your flat feet on the ground
(what I said now)


All you want to do is ride around Sally
Ride, Sally, ride
All you want to do is ride around Sally
Ride, Sally, ride
All you want to do is ride around Sally
Ride, Sally, ride
One of these early mornings oh
You gonna be wiping your weeping eyes


I bought you a brand new Mustang
About nineteen sixty five
Now you come around signifying a woman
You don't wanna let me ride
Mustang Sally now baby
Guess you better slow that Mustang down
You been running all over the town
Oh! I'll have to put your flat feet on the ground
(what I said now)
