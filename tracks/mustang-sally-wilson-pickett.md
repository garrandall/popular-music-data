Mustang Sally
Guess you better slow your mustang down
Mustang Sally, now baby oh
Guess you better slow your mustang down
Oh, you've been running all over town
Guess I gotta go 
And put your flat feet on the ground

All you wanna do is ride around sally
Ride, sally ride
All you wanna do is ride around sally
Ride, sally ride
All you wanna do is ride around sally
Ride, sally ride
All you wanna do is ride around sally
Ride, sally ride
You've been running all over town
Guess I gotta go and wipe your weeping eyes

Bought you a new mustang
From 1965, now baby
Now you're coming around
You're a signifying woman
You won't, you won't
You won't even let me ride

Mustang sally, now baby
Guess you better slow your mustang down
Oh, you've been running all over town
Guess I gotta go 
And put your flat feet on the ground

All you wanna do is ride around sally
Ride, sally ride
All you wanna do is ride around sally
Ride, sally ride
All you wanna do is ride around sally
Ride, sally ride
All you wanna do is ride around sally
Ride, sally ride
Oh,You've been running all over town
Guess I gotta go and wipe your weeping eyes
Mustang Sally, no no oh
