Oom, yacka, wurka
Oom, yacka, wurka
Oom, yacka, wurka

In the bad back lands of Australia
Many years ago
The aborigine tribes were meeting
Having a big pow-wow

Oom, yacka, wurka
Oom, yacka, wurka

We got a lot of trouble, Chief
On account of your son Mack
My boy Mack? Why, what's wrong with him?
My boomerang won't come back
Your boomerang won't come back?

My boomerang won't come back
My boomerang won't come back
I've waved the thing all over the place
Practiced till I was black in the face
I'm a big disgrace to the Aborigine race
My boomerang won't come back

I can ride a kangaroo
(Yeah, yeah)
Make Kinkajou stew
(Yeah, yeah)
But I'm a big disgrace to the aborigine race
My boomerang won't come back

They banished him from the tribe then
And sent him on his way
He had a backless boomerang
So here he could not stay

This is nice, innit? Getting banished at my time of life
What a way to spend an evening
Sitting on a rock in the middle of the desert
With me boomerang in me hand
I shall very likely get bushwhacked

Get out of it, you nasty bushwhacking animal
Think I'll make a nice cup of tea
(Doing, doing, doing)
Good gracious, there goes a kangaroo
I must have a practice with me boomerang
Hit him right behind the left ear hole
Now then, slowly back

If you throw that thing at me
I'll jump right on your head
(It chuckles and bounces away)
Innit marvelous?
Got a land full of kangaroos
And I had to pick that one

For three long months he sat there
Or maybe it was four
Then an old old man in a kangaroo skin
Came a-knocking at his door

Well, I'm the local witch doctor, son
They call me George Alfred Black
Now tell me, what's your trouble, boy?
My boomerang won't come back
Your boomerang won't come back?

My boomerang won't come back
My boomerang won't come back
I've waved the thing all over the place
Practiced till I was black in the face
I'm a big disgrace to the aborigine race
My boomerang won't come back

Don't worry, boy, I know the trick
And to you I'm gonna show it
If you want your boomerang to come back
Well, first you've got to throw it

Oh, yes, never thought of that
Daddy will be pleased
Must have a go, nyuh, huh, excuse me
Now then, slowly back and throw

Oh my God, I've hit the flying doctor
Eee, hee, hee, can you do first aid?
Don't talk to me about first aid
Boy, you owe me fourteen chickens

You know, when I learned you to throw the boomerang
You know, first things first
Yes, I know that but I mean
I think on this occasion, you know
You could be a bit more constructive
