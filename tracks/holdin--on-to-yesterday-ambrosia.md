Well I keep holdin' on to yesterday
I keep holdin' on enough to say 
That I'm wrong

I keep thinkin' that I'm lonely 
But it's only missing you inside 
Days that we were once together 
Seems they'll never come alive

So I keep holdin' on to yesterday 
I keep holdin' on enough to say 
That it's wrong

Lord I don't know when I'll see you 
I can't reach you anymore 
If I'd only known I'd need you 
Then I'd keep you like before

I keep holdin' on to yesterday 
I keep holdin' on enough to say 
That I'm wrong, wrong, wrong 
To keep holdin' on 
My yesterdays have all gone by
