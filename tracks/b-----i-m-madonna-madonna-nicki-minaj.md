Ohhhhh...
Oh Oh Oh, You're gonna love this
Oh Oh Oh, You can't touch this
Oh Oh Oh, Cause I'm a bad bitch
We hit the elevator right up to the rooftop
The bass is pumpin', make me wanna screw the top off

Yeah we'll be drinking and nobody's gonna stop us

And we'll be kissing anybody that's around us
I just wanna have fun tonight
(Love this shit tonight) Put me under the flashing light
Ooohhhhhh...
Let me blow up this house tonight (Gonna blow, blow)

We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na na na na na
We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Bitch I'm Madonna
(Bitch, Bitch I'm Madonna)
(Bitch, Bitch I'm Madonna)
We're jumping in the pool and swimming with our clothes on
ÃŽ brought a pee-wee to my show and got my freak on
The neighbors pissed and says hes gonna call the Five-O
If that's your weapon we have gonna give a good show
I just wanna go out tonight
Put me under the flashing light
Oooohhhh...
Let me blow up this house tonight (Gonna Blow, blow)
Uh!
B-B-Bitch, Move
We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long

We get freaky if you want

Na na na na na
We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Bitch I'm Madonna
(Bitch I'm Madonna)
(Bitch, Bitch I'm Madonna)
(Bitch I'm Madonna)
(Bitch I'm Madonna)
(Bitch, Bitch I'm Madonna)
(Bitch I'm Madonna)
Who do you think you are? (Bitch I'm Madonna, Bitch I'm Madonna)
You gonna mess this Lucky Star (Bitch I'm Madonna, Bitch I'm Madonna)
Ooh, oh, oh ooh (Bitch I'm Madonna, Bitch I'm Madonna)
Who do you think you are? (Uh!)

Hold up with my nose up
And that rose up in thinga
I'm froze up, but my stove up
Cause he eatin' like this his dinner
I run shit, I don't fall back

Cause I'm on track, I'm a sprinner
I'm bossed up, I got em all struck, I'm the Toster I'm the winner
Beep beep, bitch move
'Fore I bang bang with that uzz
That's miu miu on my shoes
Ain't got a thing left for me to prove
It's that bottle service all night
It's that poppin' urban just right
It's that "go hard" or "go home" zone?
Bitch, I'm Madonna, these hoes know

We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na na na na na
We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long

We get freaky if you want
Bitch I'm Madonna
Oh Oh Oh, We do it like this
Oh Oh Oh, You're gonna love this
Oh Oh Oh, You can't touch this
Oh Oh Oh, Cause I'm a bad bitch
Who do you think you are? (Cause I'm a bad bitch)
Who do you think you are? (Cause I'm a bad bitch)
Who do you think you are? (Cause I'm a bad bitch)
Who do you think you are?!!!!!!!

"Go hard" or "go home" zone, bitch
I'm Madonna these hoes know
