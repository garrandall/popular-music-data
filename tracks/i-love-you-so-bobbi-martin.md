Has anybody here seen my old friend Abraham?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed lot of people but the good they die young
I just looked around and he's gone

Has anybody here seen my old friend Martin?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed lot of people but the good they die young, so they say
I just looked around and he's gone

Didn't you love the things that they stood for?
Didn't they try to free some good for you and me?
And one day we're gonna be free
Some day soon, it's gonna be one day

Has anybody here seen Bobby or John?
Can you tell me where they've gone?
They freed lot of people but the good they die young
I just looked around and they gone

Didn't you love the things that they stood for?
Didn't they try to free some good for you and me?
And you know one day we're gonna be free
Some day soon, it's gonna be one day, yeah
Some day soon, it's gonna be one day
I want you make it soon, it's gonna be one day
Where have you gone Abraham, Martin, Bobby and John
It's gonna be one day

Yeah, we're all gonna be free
