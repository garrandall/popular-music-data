You know I love you so
I'll never let you go
'Cause deep inside
I know I love you so

I give my heart to you
You make my dreams come true
It's you and only you
I love you so

To me
You're just everything
The sun, the moon above
To me
Only you can bring happiness and love

My years will come and go
And things will change, I know
My need for you will grow
I love you so

To me
You're just everything
The sun, the moon above
To me
Only you can bring happiness and love

My years will come and go
And things will change, I know
My need for you will grow
I love you so
(I love you so)
