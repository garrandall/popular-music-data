Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance!

Ask your mom and your daddy
Can you go out tonight
When the starts are bright
Beneath the pale moonlight
Ask your mom and your daddy
Can you go out tonight
We gonna dance by the light of the moon

Oh, by the light, by the light, of the silvery moon
We gonna dance by the light of the moon
By the light, by the light of the silvery moon
We gonna dance (dance)

I got a dollar in my pocket
Gonna keep the juke a-rockin'
Keep the juke a-rockin'
'Till she wears out her stockin'
Got a dollar in my pocket
Gonna keep the juke a rockin'
Dance by the light of the moon

Oh, by the light, by the light, of the silvery moon
We gonna dance by the light of the moon
From the light, from the light of the silvery moon
We gonna dance (yeah)

I'm gonna dance with my darlin'
With a hole in her stockin'
Knees keep a-rockin'
Toes keep a-poppin'

Gonna dance with my darlin'
With a hold in her stockin'
Dance by the light of the moon

Oh, by the light, by the light, of the silvery moon
We gonna dance a-by the light of the moon
By the light, by the light, of the silvery moon
We gonna dance (yeah)

Dance, dance, oh the silvery moon
Dance, dance, oh the silvery moon

I'm gonna dance with my darlin' with the hole in her stockin'
Knees keep a knockin'
Toes keep a-poppin'
Gonna dance with my darlin' with the hole in her stockin'
Dance by the light of the moon

Oh, by the light
