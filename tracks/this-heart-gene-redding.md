Yours are the lips that
Are tempting mine, oh, baby
Your eyes keep giving me
The go ahead sign, yes, they are

I should turn my
Head and walk away
But there's always
Something that you say

That puts me where
You want me, girl
Like a fool, I stay

I'm telling you this heart
Has never been broken
This heart has never been broken
This heart has never been
Broken before, don't break it now

One night was all it took, oh, darling
You'd lead me to the point
Of no return, yes, would would

I'm revealing things I never showed
There's just no way my eager arms say no
I'm caught up in the things you do
And now I can't let go

I'm telling you this heart
(This heart of mine)
Has never been broken
(I ain't gonna let you break it)
This heart has never been broken
(I been doing fine)
This heart has never been
Broken before, don't break it now

I'm a victim of your tenderness
Lost just like a child, I guess
There's no way my arms say no
I'm caught up in the things you do
And now I can't let go

I'm telling you this heart
(This heart of mine)
Has never been broken
(I ain't gonna let you break it)
This heart has never been broken
(I been doing fine)
This heart has never been
Broken before, don't break it now
