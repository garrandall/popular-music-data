Run, run Rudolph, Santa got to make it to town
Santa's in a hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
And away went Rudolph a-reelin' like a merry-go-round

Said Santa to a girl child "What would please you most to get?"
"A little baby doll that can cry, sleep, drink and wet"
And then away went Rudolph a whizzing like a Phantom jet

Run, run Rudolph, Santa got to make it to town
Santa's in a hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
And away went Rudolph a-reelin' like a merry-go-round

Said Santa to a boy child "What have you been longing for?" 
"All I want for Christmas is a Rock and Roll electric guitar" 
And then away went Rudolph a whizzing like a shooting star

Run, run Rudolph, Santa got to make it to town
Santa's in a hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
And away went Rudolph a-reelin' like a merry-go-round

Said Santa to a girl child "What would please you most to get?"
"A little baby doll that can cry, sleep, drink and wet"
And then away went Rudolph a whizzing like a Phantom jet

Run, run Rudolph, Santa got to make it to town
Santa's in a hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
And away went Rudolph a-reelin' like a merry-go-round

Run, run Rudolph, Santa got to make it to town
Santa's in a hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
And away went Rudolph a-reelin' like a merry-go-round
