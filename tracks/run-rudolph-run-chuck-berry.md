Out of all the reindeers, you know you're the mastermind
Run, run Rudolph, Randalph ain't too far behind
Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run Rudolph cause I'm reeling like a merry-go-round

Said Santa to a boy "Child, what have you been longing for?"
"All I want for Christmas is a Rock and Roll electric guitar"
And then away went Rudolph whizzing like a shooting star

Run, run Rudolph, Santa has to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run Rudolph, reeling like a merry-go-round

Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run Rudolph, I'm reeling like a merry-go-round

Said Santa to a girl "Child, what would please you most to get?"
"A little baby doll that can cry, sleep, drink and wet"
And then away went Rudolph, whizzing like a Saber jet

Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run Rudolph, I'm reeling like a merry-go-round
