Life is a waterfall
We're one in the river
And one again after the fall

Swimming through the void
We hear the word
We lose ourselves but we find it all

'Cause we are the ones that wanna play
Always wanna go
But you never wanna stay

And we are the ones that wanna choose
Always wanna play
But you never wanna lose

Aerials in the sky
When you lose small mind
You free your life

Life is a waterfall
We drink from the river
Then we turn around and put up our walls

Swimming through the void
We hear the word
We lose ourselves but we find it all

'Cause we are the ones that wanna play
Always wanna go
But you never wanna stay

We are the ones that wanna choose
Always wanna play
But you never wanna lose

Aerials in the sky
When you lose small mind
You free your life

Aerials so up high
When you free your eyes eternal prize

Aerials in the sky
When you lose small mind
You free your life

Aerials so up high
When you free your eyes eternal prize
