Change my attempt good intentions

Crouched over
You were not there
Living in fear
But signs
Were not
Really that scarce
Obvious tears

But I will not
Hide you through this
I want you to help them,
Please see
The bleeding heart perched
On my shirt

Die, withdraw
Hide in cold sweat
Quivering lips

Ignore
Remorse
Naming a kid,
Living wasteland

This time
You've tried
All that you can
Turning you red

Change my attempt good intentions
Should I, could I
Here we are with your obsession
Should I, could I

Crowned
Hopeless
The article read
Living wasteland

This time
You've tried
All that you can
Turning you red

But I
Will not
Hide you through this
I want you to help

Change my attempt good intentions
Should I, could I

Here we are with your obsession
Should I, could I

Heave the silver
Hollow sliver
Piercing through another victim

Turn and tremble
Be judgmental
Ignorant to all the symbols

Blind the face
With beauty paste
Eventually you'll one day know

Change my attempt good intentions
Limbs tied, skin tight
Self inflicted his perdition

Should I, could I
Change my attempt good intentions
Should I, could I

Should I, could I
