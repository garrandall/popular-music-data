Oh, uhhhhhh, oh

Something in the way he moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way he woos me

I don't want to leave him now
You know I believe him how

Somewhere in his smile, he knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in his style that shows me

I don't want to leave him now
You know I believe him how

You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around now, it may show
I don't know, I don't know

Something in the way he knows
And all I have to do is think of him
Something in the things he shows me

Don't want to leave him now
You know I believe him how

You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around now, it may show
I don't know, I don't know

Something in the way he moves
Something in the way he knows
Something in the way he smiles
Something
