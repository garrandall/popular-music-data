Hey boys, gather round boys, the money's right
Go down to low town for me tonight
Walk onto forty four and knockon that big black door
Lay some money on that man
And get the very best table you can

Well,there's a soul band's wailing behind the beat
And they cook when the blue lights spin
There's a "go-go girl"? yeah
She works it out,now
Look when you walk in
Yeah, yeah, yeah,yeah
Everybody knows
To see her dance,now
My Twinkle Toes

Twinlke Toes you move and you go
And you know you do it right
Up and down,now you dance around, now
You're look in good tonight
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, come on now
Twinlke Toes
Dance on and on, now

Yeah, but Twinkle Toes
I know you're trying
To hide your broken heart;
You act so gay
Yeah,behind the smile
I know you're crying
Your big great lonely eyes
Give you away
Hey, hey,hey
Hey, hey ,hey

Twinkle Toes
You know you must hang on, girl
Hang on tight;
Don't let your feelings show
Twinkle Toes
You know you must dance on,girl
If you work it right
They'll never know

Twinkle Toes
It's tough to forget
But every thing's all right
Yeah, Twinkle Toes
Get set, â€˜cause I bet I take your home tonight
Yeah, yeah,yeah,yeah
Yeah, you're allright, now
Yeah, Twinkle Toes
You're out of sight,now
Yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah
Yeah, you're so fine, girl
Yeah, Twinkle Toes
You've hurt my mind, girl
Twinkle Toes
Come on,carry on
Now when the dance is through
You won't be lonely
You won't be blue tonight;
I'll be with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah,yeah
Yeah Twinkle Toes...
