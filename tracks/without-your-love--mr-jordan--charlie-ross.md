Honey, we've been married
Going on five years
And my love for you
Grows stronger everyday

Funny, no one thought
This love of ours would last
But we knew this love of ours
Was here to stay

Without your love
I know that I'd be nothing
And without you
I know I surely die

(Hello) hello, sweetheart
Is that wife of yours around
Cause I'd like to know if
You're seeing me tonight

Don't worry, Mr. Jordan
I'll be over right away
My wife won't mind
If I work late tonight

Honey, do you really love me
(Yes, Mr. Jordan)
I just can't stand being away
From you for so long
(Well, just ease your mind, Mr. Jordan
I'll be right over)

I don't need to tell you
You know I hate to go
It seems I always leave you all alone

It's all right
I'm sure he really needs you
So I think you'd better go
I'll just fall asleep
And dream till you come home

Goodbye, sweetheart
(So long, honey)

(Hello) hi, sweetheart, guess what
My husband's finally gone
And I can't wait till
I'm in your arms tonight

Without your love
I know that I'd be nothing
And without you
I know I'd surely die

Without your love
I know that I'd be nothing
And without you
I know I'd surely die
