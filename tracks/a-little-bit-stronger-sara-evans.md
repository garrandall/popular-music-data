Woke up late today,
And I still feel the sting of the pain.
But I brushed my teeth anyway,
I got dressed
Through the mess
And put a smile on my face.

I got a little bit stronger.

Riding in the car to work,
And I'm trying to ignore the hurt.
So I turned on the radio,
Stupid song made me think of you,
I listened to it for a minute,
But then I changed it.

I'm getting a little bit stronger,
Just a little bit stronger.

And I'm done hoping that we could work it out,
I'm done with how it feels,
Spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around.
And oh and I'm done thinking you could ever change.

I know my heart will never be the same,
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay.
Even on my weakest days,
I get a little bit stronger.

It doesn't happen overnight,
But you turn around and a month's gone by,
And you realize you haven't cried.
Not giving you an hour or a second or another minute longer.
I'm busy getting stronger.

And I'm done hoping that we could work it out,
I'm done with how it feels,
Spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around.
And oh and I'm done thinking you could ever change.

I know my heart will never be the same,
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay.
Even on my weakest days,
I get a little bit stronger.
I get a little bit stronger.

Getting along without you baby,
I'm better off without you baby,
How does it feel without me baby?
I'm getting stronger without you baby.

And I'm done hoping we could work it out,
I'm done with how it feels,
Spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around.
And oh and I'm done thinking you could ever change.

I know my heart will never be the same,
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay,
Even on my weakest days,
I get a little bit stronger.
I get a little bit stronger.

Just a little bit stronger.
A little bit, a little bit, a little bit stronger.
Get a little bit stronger.
