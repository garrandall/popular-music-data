(Cowboys to girls)
I remember (I remember)
When I used to play shoot 'em up
(Shoot 'em up, bang, bang, baby)
I remember
When I chased the girls and beat 'em up

But I was young and didn't understand
But now I'm a grownup man
I know girls are made for kissing
Never knew what I was missing
Now my life is not the same
My whole world has been rearranged

I went from (Cowboys to girls)
Oh, yes, I did (Shoot 'em up, bang, bang)
(Cowboys to girls)

I remember (I remember)
When I used to see you jumping rope
(Jumpin' rope, up and down, baby)
And I remember
When you got your first baby coach

But you were young and didn't understand
Now you're a woman and I'm a man
And it's me that you're kissing
Ain't it fun reminiscing?
And our lives are not the same
Our whole world has been rearranged

You went from (Baby dolls to boys)
Oh, yes, you did (Jumpin' rope, baby)
And I went from (Cowboys to girls)
Oh, yes, I did

Now it's me that you're kissing
Ain't it fun reminiscing?
And our life is not the same
This whole world has been rearranged

I went from (Cowboys to girls)
Oh, yes, I did (Shoot 'em up, bang, bang)
And you went from (Baby dolls to boys)
Oh, yes, you did (Jumpin' rope, baby)

(Cowboys to girls)
Oh, yes (Shoot 'em up)
(Baby dolls to boys)
Talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout
(Cowboys to girls)
