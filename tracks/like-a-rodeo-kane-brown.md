Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo

I picked you up with a cowboy nod
At the hotel bar
It was less than 8 seconds
Girl you stole my heart
We had drinks and smokes
Played you songs on guitar
I was crazy out the gate
And you were wild from the start

You hopped in my Bronco and we had the time of our life
We come a long way since then girl, but it's been a hell of a ride

Love is like a rodeo
Trying to see how far we go
After one touch became obsessed with the rush
Yeah love is like a rodeo
I just wanna steal the show
We fight and we fall
But we keep holding on
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo

Girl there's something kinda dangerous about the way you move
I knew it wouldn't be easy hanging on to you
'Cause when you hit the lights
Put your lips on mine
It gets hotter than a Houston night

Yeah love is like a rodeo
Trying to see how far we go
After one touch became obsessed with the rush
Yeah love is like a rodeo
I just wanna steal the show
We fight and we fall
But we keep holding on
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo

You hopped in my Bronco and we had the time of our life
We come a long way since then girl, but it's been a hell of a ride

Yeah love is like a rodeo
Trying to see how far we go
After one touch became obsessed with the rush
Yeah love is like a rodeo
I just wanna steal the show
We fight and we fall
But we keep holding on
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo

I picked you up with a cowboy nod
At the hotel bar
It was less than 8 seconds
Girl you stole my heart
Rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo
