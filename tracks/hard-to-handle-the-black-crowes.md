Baby, here I am, I'm a man on the scene
I can give you what you want but you got to come home with me
I've got some good old lovin' and I got some more in store
When I get through throwin' it on you, you got to come back for more


Boys and things that come by the dozen
That ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Hey little thing, let me light your candle
Cause mama, I'm sure hard to handle now, yessiram


Action speaks louder than words and I'm a man of great experience
I know you got another man but I can love you better than him
Take my hand, don't be afraid, I'm gonna prove every word I say
I'm advertising love for free, so you can place your ad with me


Boys will come along, a dime by the dozen
That ain't nothing but ten cent lovin'
Hey little thing, let me light your candle
Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now, yessiram

Yeah
Hard to handle now
Oh baby


Baby, here I am, I'm a man on your scene
I can give you what you want but you got to come home with me
I've got some good old lovin' and I got some more in store
When I get through throwin' it on you, you got to come a-runnin' back for more


Boys will come along, a dime by the dozen
That ain't nothing but drugstore lovin'
Hey little thing, let me light your candle
Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now, yessiram

Hard
Hard to handle now
Oh yeah, yeah yeah yeah




Boys will come along, a dime by the dozen
That ain't nothing but ten cent lovin'
Hey little flame, let me light your candle cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now, yessiram
Yeah
So hard to handle now
Oh yeah


Baby!
Good lovin'
Baby!
Baby!
Ohh, good lovin'

Yeah
So hard to handle, now, yeah
