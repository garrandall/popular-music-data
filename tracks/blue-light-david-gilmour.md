She's a blue light, yes it cannot be denied
She will give you back your pride
She squeezes, she freezes, she does what she pleases
But she says she thinks of others, all the time

You must rise to her defense when she's in danger
Turn around and you're looking at a stranger
She steals your savings from under your bed
And leads you into places even angels fear to tread
She's a blue light

She's not amused, when you're trying to upstage her
So you choose to do nothing to enrage her
'Cause under her mantle you feel safe from the cold
And you're safe from the danger of ever growing old
She's a blue light
