Hello 
Hello, is there anybody up here?
(Hello) Welcome 2085!
Twenty Eighty-five it is (just me up here I guess)
(OH! )
The magic of the moment snuck up on me
And caught me by surprise (OH! )
Roaming and I'm lonely man I'm longing
For that somethin in your eyes (OH! )

And I know it's not just the song
(And I know it's not just the song)
And I know it's not just the drink
(And I know it's not the drink)
But whatever it might be (Whatever it might be)
Just keep holding on to me
(OOH!) Cause I'll pull down a cloud for you
I'll circle the stars and bring you one back
I'll walk through the sun for you
Cause there's somethin you do
That got me walking on the moon
(Uhh)There's something you do
That got me walking on the moon
(Uhh)And I know that it's true baby
You got me walking on the moon

Girl don't keep me waiting, I'm impatient
Hit my runway, and let's take off and fly
Now I'm where I wanna be, come co-pilot with me
Let's burn up the sky (OH)

And I know it's not just the song
(And I know it's not just the song)
And I know it's not just the drink
(And I know it's not the drink)
But whatever it might be (Whatever it might be)
Just keep holding on to me
(OOH!) Cause I'll pull down a cloud for you
(Pull a cloud for you)
I'll circle the stars and bring you one back
I'll walk through the sun for you
Cause there's somethin you do
(There's something you do)
That got me walking on the moon
(Uhh) There's something you do
That got me walking on the moon (OH!) (UHH! )
And I know that it's true
Baby, you got me walking on the moon

Everyone out there will know that you are my girl
And my love will circle around and round
(Ayy, ayy dream I'm too good at this)
No matter what I do


Uhh, uhh, uhh, I can't contain it
No, no, no I can't restrain it
There's a lot of stars in here ain't it
But you shine so much they don't seem famous
Where'd you come from on this lonely night?
I swear god must've made lightening strike
And I bottled it up, we hit the red carpet and modeled it up
We hopped in the 'Rari and throttled it up
Now everybody clappin, they bravoed it up
All just because it's more than a buzz
More than a drink, but I took a few sips
And let it do what it does, now drunk textin
Like it's all about you, like I can't spend
Another minute without you
You know the drinks let you say things
You ain't allowed to, things interfere
But you're way to proud to say out loud
Cause niggas gonna clown you, put your black baby down
People is around you, I'll put my mack baby down
I ain't trying to hound you, just trying to take you
Where the stars gonna surround you
And Uhmm, maybe ice down you,
And Uhmm, maybe white gown you
And Uhmm, maybe we should talk about all this
After I pound you, you know I'm just playing with you,
I know a lot of people mad cause they ain't with you
Wait is it because we on the moon,
Tell em say that hey well be home soon
(Uhh were walking on the moon)

Uhh, there's something you do,
That got me walking on the moon
Uhh, and I know that it's true,
Baby, you got me walking on the moon
Everyone out there will know that you are my girl.
