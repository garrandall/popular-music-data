Hello again hello
Just called to say hello
I couldn't sleep at all tonight
And I know it's late
But I couldn't wait
Hello my friend hello
Just called to let you know
I think about you every night
While I'm here alone
And you're there at home
Hello

Maybe it's been crazy
And maybe I'm to blame
But I put my heart above my head.
We've been through it all
And loved me just the same
When you're not there
I just need to hear
Hello my friend hello
It's good to need you so
It's good to love you
Like I do
And to feel this way
When I hear you say
Hello

Hello my friend hello
Just called to let you know
I think about you every night
And I know it's late
But I couldn't wait
Hello...
