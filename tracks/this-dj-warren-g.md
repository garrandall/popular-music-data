It's kind of easy when you listen to the G'd-up sound
Pioneer speakers bumpin' as I smoke on a pound
I got the sound fo' yo' ass and it's easy to see
That this D.J. be Warren G


Can I get in where I fit in? Sit in, listen (uh-huh)
Let me conversate better yet Regulate
Shake the spot with my knot, may fade
'Cause I don't like to dream about gettin' paid
I played ball through the halls of CIS
With Snoop Dogg's big brother, call him Dirty Left
Rack 'em up, crack 'em up, stack 'em up against the gate
The homies tryin' ta catch me but they cain't, wait
Damn, the street lights just came on!
And my momma's in the streets tellin' me to come home
I hit the gate and I hops on my Schwinn
And I tell the homies, "Aight then," yeah


It's kind of easy when you listen to the G'd-up sound
Pioneer speakers bumpin' as I smoke on a pound
I got the sound fo' yo' ass and it's easy to see
That this D.J. be Warren G
It's kind of easy when you listen to the G'd-up sound
Pioneer speakers bumpin' as I smoke on a pound
I got the sound fo' yo' ass and it's easy to see
That this D.J. be Warren G


Verse two (uh-huh), now what the fuck I do?
Catch the bus to Cal State, or chill with the Voltron crew?
And make a few ends on the side
Here comes a baby blue van, time to ride
So I hops in the van with my nigga Tick
And Baby Poppa back then, that was my clique
We groovin' to Santa Ana
And we plan-on makin' hellafied mount of money (hell yeah)
And what I did for extra fees
Was break niggas after work playin' get like me
I was fourteen years old, havin' a sack
Just a young motherfucker eatin' ValuPaks
Shootin' dice in the corners of them public schools
And I used to gangbang, but now it's a G thang
And I still know how to make those ends
You don't believe me? go ask The Twinz, motherfucker


It's kind of easy when you listen to the G'd-up sound
Pioneer speakers bumpin' as I smoke on a pound
I got the sound fo' yo' ass and it's easy to see
That this D.J. be Warren G
It's kind of easy when you listen to the G'd-up sound
Pioneer speakers bumpin' as I smoke on a pound
I got the sound fo' yo' ass and it's easy to see

KnowhatI'msayin'? I'm on my little O.G. Warren G
And he just droppin' this to let you BG's know
What's happen, y'all got to recognize
Cause this is y'know a Long Beach thang
21st Street, but check this out
G gonna go out there, yaknowhatI'msayin'?
And handle that shit y'now? Yeah


It's kind of easy when you listen to the G'd-up sound
Pioneer speakers bumpin' as I smoke on a pound
I got the sound fo' yo' ass and it's easy to see
That this D.J. be Warren G
It's kind of easy when you listen to the G'd-up sound
