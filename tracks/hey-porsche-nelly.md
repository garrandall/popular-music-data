Hey lil' Porsche, I wanna try ya
Crazy baby girl, there ain't nothing like you
Hey lil' Porsche, so right I had to get ya
B-b-back it up, let's roll, roll, roll, roll

Girl let's go!
You sexy thing, you turn me on,
I need a private show,
Here on the lawn, in my garage
I take you on the road, hey Porsche girl
You know what I wanna do (wanna do)
Come on let me slide under so I can work on, work on you


I wanna take your top off,
Celebrate this champagne pop-off, yeah,
We could turn the clocks off
No rush, baby we could just park somewhere
I don't need (I don't need) nobody's permission, yeah.
No keys (no keys), push start to ignition. Say...


Hey lil' Porsche, I wanna try ya
Crazy baby girl, there ain't nothing like you
Hey lil' Porsche, so right I had to get ya
B-b-back it up, let's roll, roll, roll, roll

Na-na-na-na-na-na
Hey Porsche
Na-na-na-na-na-na
I want you
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Hey Porsche
Na-na-na-na-na-na
I, I want you

Girl you know,
Damn I've been dreaming about the day you let me take you home
Just for a weekend, maybe more, just sayinâ
See, Iâve never seen an ass like that
You gon' make a nigga crash like that
Since I seen you in the window,
Knew what I was in for
Spending every rack on that


I wanna take your top off,
Celebrate this champagne pop-off, yeah,
We could turn the clocks off
No rush, baby we could just park somewhere
I don't need (I don't need) nobody's permission
No keys (no keys), push start to ignition. Say...


Hey lil' Porsche, I wanna try ya
Crazy baby girl, there ain't nothing like you
Hey lil' Porsche, so right I had to get ya
B-b-back it up, let's roll, roll, roll, roll

Na-na-na-na-na-na
Hey Porsche
Na-na-na-na-na-na
I want you
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Hey Porsche
Na-na-na-na-na-na
I, I want you

I wanna see how fast you can go (fast you can go)
See how you handle as I'm cruising control
As I make you turn around
Hey, let me turn up your sound
T-t-turn it up and now here we go


Hey lil' Porsche, I wanna try ya
Crazy baby girl, there ain't nothing like you
Hey lil' Porsche, so right I had to get ya
B-b-back it up, let's roll, roll, roll, roll

Na-na-na-na-na-na
Hey Porsche
Na-na-na-na-na-na
I want you
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Hey Porsche
Na-na-na-na-na-na
I, I want you
