Kick the dust up
Come on

All week long it's a farming town
They're making that money grow
Tractors, plows with flashing lights
Backin up a two lane road
They take one last lap around
That sun up high goes down
And then it's on, come on, girl, kick it on back
Z71 like a Cadillac

We go way out where
There ain't nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let's tear it up up
And kick the dust up

Bar downtown, they got a line
Of people waiting out the door
Ten dollar drinks, it's packed inside
I don't know what they're waitin for
Got me a jar full of clear
And I got that music for your ear
And it's like knock knock knock goes the diesel
If you really wanna see the beautiful people

We go way out where
There ain't nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Let's back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let's tear it up up
And kick the dust up

Just follow me down 'neath the 32 bridge
Y'all be glad you did
Kick it

We go way out where
There ain't nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up (kick the dust up)
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
That's what's up up
Let's kick the dust up
