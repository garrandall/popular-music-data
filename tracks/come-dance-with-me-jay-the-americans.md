Don't turn away, put him down, turn around and dance with me
Do like I say, don't you go, tell him no and dance with me
He may have walked you through the door
And he may be planning a whole lot more
But I'm gonna swing you 'round this floor, come dance with me

Look him straight in his eyes, put him wise and come on and dance with me
I'll sit and wait till you do, when you're through, come dance with me
Just 'cause he spent the dime to phone ya
And 20 bucks for the time he's shown ya
That doesn't give him the right to own ya, dance with me

I'm not the kind of guy who'd steal a fella's girl
But baby, your feet I need
And after taking just one look at you
I've turned into an ever-loving deed, aye!

You come into my arms, say goodbye to the guy and dance with me
Leave all your charms in my care, take your dare and dance with me
He may have brought you here, all right
Thinking he'd get to hold you tight
But you're gonna leave with me tonight, come dance with me

He may have brought you here, all right
Thinking he'd get to hold you tight
But you're gonna leave with me tonight, come dance with me
