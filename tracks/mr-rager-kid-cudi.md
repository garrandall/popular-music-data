I'm off on a adventure
Yeah.. We're good. This is dedicated to all the kids like me
I'm on my way to Heaven
Wherever you are, now
We're good

Birds seen flyin' around
You never see them too long on the ground
You wanna be one of them
You wanna be one of them

You might hear the birds sing and flyin' around
You never see them too long on the ground
You wanna be one of them
You wanna be one of them

Whoa now
Hey! Mr. Rager! Mr. Rager!
Tell me where you're going!
Tell us where you're headed!
I'm off on a adventure
Mr. Rager!
Tell me some of your stories
Tell us of your travels

Hey! Mr. Rager! Mr. Rager!
Tell me where you're going!
Tell us where you're headed!
I'm on my way to Heaven
Mr. Rager!
Can we tag along? Can we take a journey?

Knocked down round for round
You're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end? 
When will the Heaven begin?

You might be knocked down round for round
You're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end?
When will the Heaven begin?

Whoa now
Hey! Mr. Rager! Mr. Rager!
Tell me where you're going!
Tell us where you're headed!
I'm off on a adventure
Mr. Rager!
Tell us some of your stories
Tell us of your travels

Hey! Mr. Rager! Mr. Rager!
Tell me where you're going!
Tell us where you're headed!
I'm on my way to Heaven
Mr. Rager!
Can we tag along? Can we take a journey?

Hey! Mr. Rager! Mr. Rager!
Tell me where you're going!
Tell me where you're headed!
I'm off on a adventure
Mr. Rager!
Tell me some of your stories
Tell us of your travels

Mr. Rager-er-er-er-er!
Tell me where you're going!
Tell us where you're headed!
I'm on my way to Heaven
Mr. Rager!
Can we tag along? Can we take that journey?

Can we take that journey? 
I'm off on a adventure

Hey! Mr. Rager!
