I need an alarm system in my house
So I know when people are
Creeping about
These people are
Freaking me out (these days)
It's getting hectic everywhere that I go
They won't leave me alone
There's things they all wanna know
I'm paranoid of all the people I meet
Why are they talking to me?
And why can't anyone see


I just wanna live
Don't really care about the things that they say
Don't really care about what happens to me
I just wanna live
Just wanna live
Just wanna live
Just wanna live
Just wanna live
Just wanna live
Just wanna live


I rock a
Lawsuit when I'm going to court
A white suit when I'm getting divorced
A black suit at the funeral home
And my birthday suit when I'm home alone
Talking on the phone
Got an interview
With the Rolling Stone
They're saying
"Now you're rich and
Now you're famous
Fake-ass girls all know your name and
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
Your first hit aren't you ashamed?"
Of the life
Of the life
Of the life we're living


I just wanna live
Don't really care about the things that they say
Don't really care about what happens to me
I just wanna live


"Stop your messing around, boy
Better think of your future
Better make some good plans, boy"
Said everyone of my teachers
Lookout!
You better play it safe
You never know what hard times will come your way
We say
Where we're coming from
We've already seen
The worst that this life can bring
Now we expect it everywhere that we go
All the things that they say
Yeah we already know


I just wanna live
Don't really care about the things that they say
Don't really care about what happens to me
Just wanna live
Just wanna live
Just wanna live


(I just wanna live) Just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live
(I just wanna live) Just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live
(Don't really care about the things that they say)
Just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live
(Don't really care about what happens to me)
(I just wanna live)
