I need an alarm system in my house 
So I know when people are 
Creeping about
These people are
Freaking me out (these days)

Itâs getting hectic everywhere that I go
They wonât leave me alone
Thereâs things they all wanna know
I'm paranoid of all the people I meet
Why are they talking to me?
And why canât anyone see

I just wanna live
Donât really care about the things that they say
Donât really care about what happens to me
I just wanna live 
Just wanna live 

I rock a 
Lawsuit when Iâm going to court
A white suit when Iâm gettinâ divorced 
A black suit at the funeral home
And my birthday suit when Iâm home alone
Talkinâ on the phone
Got an interview
With the rolling stone
Theyâre saying 
âNow youâre rich and 
Now youâre famous 
Fake ass girls all know your name and 
Lifestyles of the rich and famous 
Your first hit arenât you ashamed?â
Of the life 
Of the life weâre livinâ

I just wanna live
Donât really care about the things that they say
Donât really care about what happens to me
I just wanna live 

Stop your messinâ around boy
Better think of your future
Better make some good plans boy
Said everyone of my teachers

Lookout
You better play it safe
You never know what hard times will come your way
We say
Where weâre coming from 
Weâve already seen
The worst that this life can bring

Now we expect it everywhere that we go
All the things that they say 
Yeah we already know 

I just wanna live
Donât really care about the things that they say
Donât really care about what happens to me
Just wanna live 

I just wanna live
Just wanna live 

I just wanna live
Just wanna live 
Donât really care about the things that they say
Just wanna live 
Donât really care about what happens to me

I just wanna live
