Love and hate get it wrong
She cut me right back down to size
Sleep the day
Let it fade
Who was there to take your place

No one knows never will
Mostly me but mostly you
What do you say
Do you do when it all comes down

'Cause I don't wanna come back down from this cloud
It's taken me all this time to find out what I need
I don't wanna come back down from this cloud
It's taken me all this all this time

There is no blame
Only shame
When you beg you just complain
The more I come the more I try
All police are paranoid

So am I
So's the future
So are you
Be a creature
What do you say
Do you do when it all comes down

'Cause I don't wanna come back down from this cloud
It's taken me all this time to find out what I need
I don't wanna come back down from this cloud
It's taken me all this all this time

Shoot up
Shoot up
Shoot up
You're high

Love and hate get it wrong
She cut me right back down to size
Sleep the day
Let it fade
Who was there to take your place

No one knows
Never will
Mostly me but mostly you
What do you say
Do you do when it all comes down

'Cause I don't wanna come back down from this cloud
It's taken me all this time to find out what I need
I don't wanna come back down from this cloud
It's taken me all this all this time

Why did you
Why did you
Why did you
Why did you
Why did you
Why did you
Why did you
Why did you
Why did you come down
I don't wanna come back down from this cloud
This cloud, this cloud, this cloud, this cloud, this cloud, this cloud, this cloud, this cloud, this cloud
