I want you, baby
More than words can say
But you got another man
Standing in my way

Now the man knows
He's got something good
He's holding on to you
The same way that I would

We've got to move 'em out
Move 'em out, move 'em out
So I can move in with you, baby
We've got to move 'em out
Move 'em out, move 'em out
So I can move in with you, baby

Whatever it takes to get you back
You can bet I'm gonna do it
And that's a natural fact

I got plans up my sleeve
And I'm tired of waiting 'round
For this man to leave

Nothing's been the same
Since he's been here
'Cause he can't hug and kiss me
Lord, like you did

It's been so hard
For the both of us
To get back together
We got to do just what we must

Yeah, yeah, yeah...

With you, baby
With you, baby
With you, baby
