With KC

Calling out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancing in the street

They're dancing in Chicago
(Dancing in the street)
Down in New Orleans
(Dancing in the street)
In New York City
(Dancing in the street)

All we need is music
(Sweet, sweet) sweet
(Sweet, sweet) music
They'll be music (music)
Everywhere (everywhere)

They'll be swinging
Swaying and records playing
Dancing in the street

Oh, it doesn't
Matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on every guy
Grab a girl, everywhere
Around the world

They'll be dancing
(Dancing in the street)
They're dancing in the street
(Dancing in the street)

This is an invitation
Across the nation
A chance for folks to meet
They'll be laughing, singing
And music swinging
Dancing in the street

Philadelphia, PA
(Dancing in the street)
Baltimore and D.C. now
(Dancing in the street)
Can't forget the Motor City
(Dancing in the street)

All we need is music
(Sweet, sweet) sweet
(Sweet, sweet) music
They'll be music (music)
Everywhere (everywhere)

They'll be swinging
Swaying and records playing
Dancing in the street

Oh, it doesn't
Matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on every guy
Grab a girl, everywhere
Around the world

They're dancing
They're dancing in the street
(Dancing in the street)

Way down in L.A. everyday
They're dancing in the street
(Dancing in the street)
Let's form a big strong line
Get in time, we're dancing in the street
(Dancing in the street)
Across the ocean blue, me and you
