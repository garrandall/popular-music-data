Get up on your feet
Before the night is through for you want miss
Get down to the beat
Pump it, stomp it, jam, trip on this!
Get the party started
Get it on, get a move on, kids
Rock! to the beat
Pump it, stomp it, jam, trip on this!

Get up, get up, get busy do it
Get up and move that body
Get up people now get down to it (before the night is over)
Get up, get up, get busy do it
I wanna see you party
Get up people now get down to it (before the night is over)

We got to take a stand
Now that we're in demand
Party all night, cut the fight
Do what's right and you just might
Win a battle you never fought
Just by checkin' this record you bought
Over and on and on again
Get with it and do that thing

Get up, get up, get busy do it
Get up and move that body
Get up people now get down to it (before the night is over)
Get up, get up, get busy do it
I wanna see you party
Get up people now get down to it (before the night is over)

Get Up
get down! (before the night is over)
get down... (before the night is over)

One, two, I'll party you
Three, four, so get your butt on the floor
Five, six, know you dig the mix
Seven, eight, let it shake
Get down, I'll party you
Three, four, so get your butt on the floor
Five, six, know you dig the mix
Seven, eight, let it shake

Get down, get up
Get down, get up
Get down, get up
Get down, get up

One, two, I'll party you
Three, four, so get your butt on the floor
Five, six, know you dig the mix
Seven, eight, let it shake

One, two, I'll party you
Three, four, so get your butt on the floor
Five, six, know you dig the mix
Seven, eight, let it shake

Get down, get up
Get down, get up
Get down, get up
Get down, get get get get
get up, Get up on your feet
Before the night is through for you want miss
Get down to the beat
Pump it, stomp it, jam, trip on this!
