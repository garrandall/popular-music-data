The moon is right
The spirits up
We're here tonight
And that's enough


Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time


The party's on
The feeling's here
That only comes
This time of year


Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time


The choir of children sing their song
They practised all year long
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong


Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time


The word is out
About the town
To lift a glass
And don't look down


Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time


The choir of children sing their song
They practiced all year long
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong


The party's on
The feeling's here
That only comes
This time of year


Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time


The moon is right
The spirits up
We're here tonight
And that's enough


Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time


Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
