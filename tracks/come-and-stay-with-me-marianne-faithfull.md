I'll send away all my false pride
And I'll forsake our love my lies
Yes, I'll be as true, as true can be
If you'll come and stay with me

Lovers of the past I'll leave behind
There'll never be another on my mind
I'll do all I can so you'll feel free
If you'll come and stay with me

The promises I made most faithfully
I'll keep still, should you decide to leave
I'll try and see that you have all you need
If you come and stay with me

We'll live a life no one has ever known
But I know you're thinking that I'm hardly grown
But O thank God, at last and finally
I can see you're gonna stay with me

But O thank God, at last and finally
I can see you're gonna stay with me
