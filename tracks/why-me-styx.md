I guess we used to be the lucky ones
Whose fortune smiled on everyone
Stop (stop)
A voice said you best beware
Stop (stop)
Bad luck is everywhere
And sure enough the voice was right
My luck had changed overnight
Stop (stop)
Please tell me what went wrong
Stop (stop)
I can't take these ups and downs
Hard times come (hard times come)
And hard times go (hard times go)
And in between you hope and pray
The scars don't show
'Cause life is strange (life is strange)
And so unsure (so unsure)
The days you hardly make it through
You swear that there's a curse on you
And nothing seems to fit
And things won't go your way
You know you've had enough
You've got the right to say
Why me, why me

Stop (stop)
Here comes anxiety
Stop (stop)
Won't you please let me be, I need relief
Hard times come (hard times come)
And hard times go (hard times go)
In between you hope and pray
The scars don't show
'Cause life is strange (life is strange)
And so unsure (so unsure)
The days you hardly make it through
You're sure that there's a curse on you
And nothing seems to fit
And things don't go your way
You know you've had enough
You can't take another day
Where to go and what to do
You've got those bills to pay
You're really not alone you know
'Cause everybody says
Why me, why me
(Why me that's what I want to know
You know what I mean?)
