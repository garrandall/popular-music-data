Look out, there's a sunny day
I do believe it's headed your way
You've been crying long enough
But you'll forget what a teardrop was

You've got a good love coming
You've got a good love coming
You've got a good love coming
To you tonight

Knock, knock baby, guess who's here
I've come to make one thing clear
No more heartaches, no more fears
Tonight's the night they're gonna disappear

'Cause you've got a good love coming
You've got a good love coming
You've got a good love coming
To you tonight

Hold on, don't you go nowhere
You're gonna get it as soon as I get there

You've got a good love coming
You've got a good love coming
You've got a good love coming
To you tonight
