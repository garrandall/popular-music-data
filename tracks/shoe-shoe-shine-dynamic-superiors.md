First of all
Let's get one thing straight
All the things you desire
Will have to come late
Ain't handing you no jive
Telling you it is what it ain't
Pretending I can do things
That I, oh, that I can't
But I remember (I remember)
I remember (I remember)
(CHORUS)
Shoe shoe shine used to cost a dime
A penny could buy you plenty
A nickel was the fare
To take you anywhere
Troubles, we didn't have many
I may not have much to speak of
But there'll always be plenty of love
You might as well get

Rid of those crazy ideas
Rainy days will outnumber
The ones you see clear
The picture in your dreams, no
That ain't the way it's gonna be
When you sit in your lucky chair
All you may have is me
Telling the story (telling the story)
Of glory (of glory) when
(CHORUS)
I may not have much to speak of
But there'll always be plenty of love
Telling the story (telling the story)
Of glory (of glory) when
(CHORUS) 3X to fade
