Sunday for tea
I'll see you Sunday for tea
And though it's not far away
Each hour's a day to me

Lettuce and ham
Or maybe crumpets and jam
Oh baby, it'll be fun
Havin' a Sunday tea

And as you pass the sugar bowl to me
I'll see at last your heart and soul will be with me

Sunday could be
A special Sunday for me
Together we'll surely find
That two of a kind are we
On Sunday for tea

And as you pass the sugar bowl to me
I'll see at last your heart and soul will be with me

Sunday for tea
I'll see you Sunday for tea
Together we'll surely find
That two of a kind are we
On Sunday for tea
