This thing called love, I just can't handle it
This thing called love, I must get 'round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love


This thing (this thing), called love (called love)
It cries (like a baby) in a cradle at night
It swings, it jives
It shakes all over like a jellyfish
I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love


There goes my baby
She knows how to rock and roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat


I gotta be cool, relax
Get hip and get on my tracks
Take a backseat, hitchhike
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love


This thing called love, I just can't handle it
This thing called love, I must get 'round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love...
