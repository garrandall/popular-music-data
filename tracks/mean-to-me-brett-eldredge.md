If I could be the reason your hair's a mess
The bass drum beatin way down deep in your chest
If I could be the voice on your radio
Then I could be your long ride home

If mine could be the name that changes yours
The wine in your glass
The swing on your porch
The dollar in your pocket
And the peaceful in your sleep
Then I'd be what you mean to me

Standing here
Watching you
Turning every head in this crowded room
The lights down low
Dancin slow
Oh, if falling's how you feel
And perfect is what you see
Then I'd be what you mean to me

If I could be the fire in your firefly
The cool in the rain
The spark in your eye
The answer to your prayer
And the faith that sets you free
Then I'd be what you mean to me

Standing here
Watching you
Turning every head in this crowded room
The lights down low
Dancin slow
Oh, if falling's how you feel
And perfect is what you see
Then I'd be what you mean to me
What you mean to me

And oh, 
All of this talkin makes you laugh
But I've gotta let you know just how I'm feeling while I'm 
Standing here
Watching you
Turning every head in this crowded room
The lights down low
Dancin slow
Oh, if falling's how you feel
And perfect is what you see
Then I'd be what you mean to me

Yea
Falling's how you feel
And perfect's what you see
Then I'd be what you mean to me
Be what you mean to me
Ohhhhh, be what you mean, what you mean, what you mean, what you mean to me
