Sailor boy (sailor boy)
Sailor boy (sailor boy)
Hurry home to me

When shadows fall
I sit alone and as
My eyes get misty

I still recall how much
I love the way
You used to kiss me

Though you're away
I love still
I always will

Sailor boy
Oh, sailor boy

My thoughts drift back

To those last days
When we were still together

And once again
I hear you say
That you'll be mine forever

I hope and pray
Those words were true
I wish I knew

Sailor boy
Sailor boy
Oh, my sailor boy

I'll never mind the waving
That's one thing
I'll be resigned to

As long I know you still
Want the girl
You left behind you

When you come home
Across the sea
Come home to me

Sailor boy
Sailor boy
Oh, my sailor boy

Sailor boy (sailor boy)
Sailor boy (sailor boy)
Hurry home to me
