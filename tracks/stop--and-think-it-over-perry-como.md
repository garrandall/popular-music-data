Why don't you stop! ( click, click ) and think it over ?
Before ( click, click ) you say it's over
Because ( click, click )
It'll never be over for me

( repeat verse )
Think of all the happy times we knew
All the memories I shared with you . . 

( repeat verse )
Don't walk out the door and say goodbye
Isn't what we had worth one more try?

( repeat verse )
I just don't know, what I would do
Darling, without you
What a cold an' lonely place this world would be . . 

If you leave me now, you'll hurt me so
Just for ol' times sake before you go . . 

( repeat verse twice to fade )
Words and Music by Sid Tepper
And Roy C. Bennett
