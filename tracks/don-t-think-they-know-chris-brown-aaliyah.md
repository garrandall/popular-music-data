I don't think they know the truth
A-A to the L-I-Y-A-H
Say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know?
I don't think they know the truth
It's Breezy
Say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know?


Don't let 'em tell you any different
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They don't know about us, they don't know about it ('Bout it)
I owe it all to you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They don't know about us, they don't know about it ('Bout it)
And as much as I messed up, always give me your best love
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They don't know about us, they don't know about it ('Bout it)
Sometimes I wonder what I did to deserve you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They don't know about us, they don't know about it ('Bout it)


They gon' talk about it, gon' talk about it
Gon' try to change your mind about it
Gon' tell you things you don't wanna hear, but we good
D-D-Don't worry 'bout it
So when they talk about, they talk about it
Just let 'em know we already got it
Just tell 'em that we gon' work at it, we good
D-D-Don't worry 'bout it


I don't think they know the truth, say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know?
I don't think they know the truth, say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know?


Don't listen to, how could they know?
What people say, how could they know?
They don't know about, how could they know?
'Bout you and me, how could they know?


At my best you love me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They don't know about us, they don't know about it ('Bout it)
Even or at my worst
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They don't know about us, they don't know about it ('Bout it)
And I know that it's different, feels like we're best friends, we connected
They don't know about us, they don't know about it ('Bout it)
What did I do to deserve you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They don't know about us, they don't know about it ('Bout it)


They gon' talk about it, gon' talk about it
Gon' try to change your mind about it
Gon' tell you things you don't wanna hear, but we good
D-D-Don't worry 'bout it
So when they talk about, they talk about it
Just let 'em know we already got it
Just tell 'em that we gon' work at it, we good
D-D-Don't worry 'bout it


I don't think they know the truth, say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know? (I don't think they—)
I don't think they know the truth (Say it ain't so), say it ain't so
I don't think they know (I don't think they—), how could they know?


Don't listen to, how could they know?
What people say, how could they know?
They don't know about, how could they know?
'Bout you and me, how could they know?


How could they know?
They don't know about us, they don't know about it
How could they know?
Damn
How could they know? (Hahaha)
They don't know about us, they don't know about it
How could they know?


I thank you for the autographs and the cheers over the years
You stood by me, you didn't doubt me (Yeah)
I think you want some more (Oh)
I do more than sing
I model now, acting now (Oh, yeah)
Plus I got my own movie now
After all the awards that they gave me, you stood by me
You didn't play me, you didn't doubt me
I think you want some more (Need some more, babe)
I truly believe that if it wasn't all for you
I don't know what I would do (Oh, whoa)
Oh-whoa


I don't think they know the truth, say it ain't so
I don't think they know, how could they know?
I don't think they know the truth (They don't know), say it ain't so (They don't know)
I don't think they know, how could they know? (Yeah, yeah)


Don't listen to (Oh-oh), how could they know? (Yeah, yeah)
What people say (Oh-oh), how could they know?
They don't know about (They don't know about us, babe), how could they know?
'Bout you and me, how could they know?
