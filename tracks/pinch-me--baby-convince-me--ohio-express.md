If you are mine
Come on, girl
And give me the sign
I need affection
Come on, baby
Supply the direction
Come on

Pinch me, baby, pinch me
Come on and convince me
Pinch me, baby, pinch me
Come on and convince me

Don't tell me stop when
I'm on my way to the top
I want to groove
So come on, baby
And make your move
Come on

Pinch me, baby, pinch me
Come on and convince me
Pinch me, baby, pinch me
Come on and convince me

Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do

If you survive
We got to do it
One more time
It's nothing moves
You pinch me
And I'll pinch you
Come on now

Pinch me, baby, pinch me
Come on and convince me
Alright
Pinch me, baby, pinch me
Come on and convince me
Do do do do
Pinch me, baby, pinch me
Come on and convince me
Do do do do
Pinch me, baby, pinch me
Come on and convince me
Do do do do
Pinch me, baby, pinch me
Come on and convince me
