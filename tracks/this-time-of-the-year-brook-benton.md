Christmas always comes this time of the year

Little girls and little boys
Dream of worlds full of toys
This time of the year
When Christmas is near

Evergreens are snowy white
Sleigh bells ring through the night
This time of the year
When Christmas is near

And somewhere near a steeple
People kneel and pray
And choirs sing
Carols of Christmas day

Santa Claus is on his way
Loads of joy, on his sleigh
This time of the year
When Christmas is near

Hear the sleigh bells
Hear the sleigh bells
Hear the sleigh bells, ring
