This is how we do it in a UK vibe
This is how we do it
Ha it's the Mis-Teeq (Mis-Teeq, Mis-Teeq)
This is how we do it
Feel the flava this is party time
This is how we do it
Cos Su-Elise, Alesha, Sabrina bring the rhyme

This is how we do it, it's Friday night
And I feel all right
The party's here on the West side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver turn the keys to my truck
Hit the shore 'cause I'm faded
Guys in the street say, "Girls, yo we made it!"
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gang bangers forgot about the drive-by

You gotta get your groove on, before you go get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbours you got much flava (This is how we do it)
So flip the track, bring the old school back (This is how we do it)

This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an O.G. mack or a wanna-be playa
You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lower-case G
But now I'm a big G, the guys see I got the money
Dollar dollar bill y'all

If you were from where I'm from then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '6 4
Whatever it is, the party's underway
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

I'm kinda buzzed, and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbours you got much flava (This is how we do it)
So flip the track, bring the old school back (This is how we do it)

Oh I'm buzzing because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does, nobody does (This is how we do it)
L O N, D O N (This is how we do it) all my homies
I'll never come wack on an old school track (This is how we do it)

Check it out!
Once upon a time in '94
Mis-Teeq made no money and life sure was slow
And all they said was 5'8" he stood
And people thought the music that he made was good
There lived a D.J. PDS was his name
He came up to me and this is what he said
You and them girls are gonna make some cash
Sell a million records and we'll make in a dash

Oh I'm buzzing because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does, nobody does (This is how we do it)
L O N, D O N (This is how we do it) all my homies
I'll never come wack on an old school track (This is how we do it)

I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbours you got much flava (This is how we do it)
So flip the track, bring the old school back (This is how we do it)

This is how we do it (This is how we do it)
Mis-Teeq does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
All my neighbours you got much flava (This is how we do it)
And we'll never come wack on an old school back (This is how we do it)

This is how we do it
This is how we do it
This is how we do it
This is how we do it
