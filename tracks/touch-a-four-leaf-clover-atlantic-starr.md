(Ooh...hoo...) Touch a four leaf clover
Maybe you'll get over (Yeah)
Try and luck might come your way (Your way)

Here I am on a cloud
If you want me, take the chance, cry "Love" out loud
As I drift through the sky
Shooting Cupid's loving arrow, you just might try

But don't miss me
Take your time and aim
âCause you've only got one chance
I think you better touch

Touch a four leaf clover (Yeah)
And maybe you'll get over
Touch a four leaf clover
And luck might get you over (Ooh)
Touch a four leaf clover (Yeah)
And maybe you'll get over
Try and luck might come your way

Like the wind, I am free
Going places, being things I wanna be
To settle down is, oh, so hard
But I will grant you that one chance, pick the right card

But don't miss it
Take your time, pick it
You only got one chance
You'd better

Touch a four leaf clover
And maybe you'll get over (Maybe you'll get over)
Touch a four leaf clover (Yeah, yeah)
And luck might get you over (It just might get you over)
Touch a four leaf clover
And maybe you'll get over
Try and luck might come your way

I'm free as a bird, yeah, yeah, yeah
To catch me is to catch a leprechaun, hoo, ooh
Hold on to your rabbit's foot
And I just might be yours forever
But you'd better

Touch a four leaf clover (Yeah)
And maybe you'll get over (Maybe you will get over)
Touch a four leaf clover (Mmm)
And luck might get you over (It might get you over)
Touch a four leaf clover (Yeah)
And maybe you'll get over (Try it)
Try and luck might come your way (Hoo)

Touch a four leaf clover
You might get lucky, you just might get me
You, yeah, oh, just get might get lucky
Touch a four leaf clover
You never know, maybe you'll get over

Come on, baby, touch it
âCause you just might do it
Like the wind I am free
But you know I think you just might be the one for me
So come and touch it
Touch that four leaf clover
Ooh, babe, oh, babe
Just might get lucky
Ooh, yeah, touch that four leaf clover
