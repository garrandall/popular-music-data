Boy, I can't wait to get you alone,
Inside my house.
'Cause baby it's you and only you,
That I keep on thinking about.
I know that you want it,
How good my love could be.
Tonight you will get the answer,
I'll satisfy your curiosity.



Take me away in ecstasy,
I want to know how it feels to be loved.
Boy take your time because I have all night,
I'm gonna show you what I been thinking of


I've got love on my mind,
I knew it's the way to make things right,
I think it's about that time.
I got love on my mind,
I'm in the mood to be moved,
And do all the things you want me to.


I've been watching you,
And thinking to myself.
You're looking so so def to me,
And I'm feeling so sexy.
You know I never felt this way before,
I really can't help myself,
'Cause I'm thinking of nothing else.
