Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey

Chilling on a beach with my sweet Georgia peach.
Not a care in the world, just trying to beat the heat.
Body like an hourglass, sand on her feet.
Can't help but stare cause I got the best seat.
Just when I thought it couldn't get any hotter you slid on in,
Said, "I'm a little hot and bothered, if you know what I mean.
Let's crank it up to a hundred degrees." Alright

You hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet.
Burned me up and down, no way to cool it.
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey.
Like a bottle of Jack straight to the head.
One shot, two shot, copper tone red.
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey.

Slow driving south with the drop top down,
Hair in the wind, Tom Petty up loud.
You gave me that look, you licked them lips.
I said, "Hang on baby, better pull over for this."
I don't wanna get DWK, driving while kissing they'll put you away.

You hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet.
Burned me up and down, no way to cool it.
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey.
Like a bottle of Jack straight to the head.
One shot, two shot, copper tone red.
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey.

Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey. 

Well, you hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet
Burn me up and down, no where to cool it

Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey.

You hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet.
Burned me up and down, no way to cool it.
But every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey.
It's like a bottle of Jack straight to the head.
One shot, two shot, copper tone red.
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey.

Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey.
