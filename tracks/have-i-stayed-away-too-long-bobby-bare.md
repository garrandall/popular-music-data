Ride me down easy, Lord, ride me on down
Leave word in the dust where I lay
Say I'm easy to come, easy to go
I'm easy to love when I stay.

This old highway she's harder than nine kinds of hell
The rides they're as scarce as the rain Light there it scares as the rain
When you're down to your last shop with nothing to sell
And too far away from the train.

Well, the good month of Sundays and a guitar to go
Had a tall drink of yesterday's wine
Left the long string of friends some sheets in the wind
And some satisfied women behind.

So won't you ride me down easy, Lord, ride me on down
Leave word in the dust where I lay
Say I'm easy to come, easy to go
I'm easy to love when I stay.

I put snow on the mountain raised hell on the hill
Lock horns with the devil himself
Been a rodeo bum a son of a gun
And a hobo with stars in his crown.

So won't you ride me down easy, Lord, ride me on down
Leave word in the dust where I lay
Say I'm easy to come, easy to go
I'm easy to love when I stay.

Heym won't you ride me down easy, Lord, ride me on down
Leave word in the dust where I lay
Say I'm easy to come, easy to go
I'm easy to love when I stay...
