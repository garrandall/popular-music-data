Have I stayed away too long
Have I stayed away too long
If I came home tonight
Would you still be my darling
Or have I stayed away too long

I'm just outside of town
And I'll soon be at your door
But maybe I'd be wrong
To hurry there

I'd best keep out of town
And worry you no more
For, maybe someone else
Has made you care

Oh, have all of my dreams gone wrong
My beautiful dreams gone wrong
If I came home tonight
Would you still be my darling
Or have I stayed away too long
Or have I stayed away too long
