Oh if these walls could talk, I would talk right back
I would talk, I would talk 'til they fade to black
The Jack Daniels don't soothe me no more
Oh Jackie Boy, Jackie Boy, show me the door
Show me peace, show me grief, show me what it means
To live a life so sunk it's not worthy to breathe
It's too early to see, it's too late to retreat
So the ship sails on to its perfect defeat
And I try to stay aboard
But when it rains, it pours
I drink a bottle of the captains 'til I wash up on shore
Don't tell me how to live this life, I live this hell
I doubt the devil had an army until the angels fell

Now wake up
Iâll seek you out
Flay you alive
One more word and you wonât survive
And Iâm not scared of your stolen power
I see right through you any hour


In such a place you either breathe or you suffocate
It's such a waste, don't you see what you've done to me, got
Holes in my heart like the holes in my liver
It seems the less she take is the more I give her
So, never the winner, forever the stranger
You hate me for what I was
Forget the good I do
A strange place where I keep my feelings
Call it Fort Knox with a see through ceiling
Cause where I stand I don't see the path, I see the past
I see the problems that await but I don't seem to act
So nothing's learned, no triumphant return
I never put out the fire, I just watch it all burn, thinkingâ¦

Felling any foe with my gaze
Steadily emerging with grace


It's time to say goodbye
There ain't no more hellos
I set it all on fire
That's how the story goes
Turn the page, let it fade, watch it decay
See the flame, let it rain, watch it be tamed
I see the bandage, I know that you know you damaged
I pray that you feel what I feel
And only hope that you panic
The message is in the bottle
The current will help deliver
There is no return to sender
Like everything that I give her
I can fill the flask up
But can't get past us
I'm in the storm, stayin' strong, but can't get back up
A sudden change, the wind, will spin his game we're in
But when there's nothing to hold, you'd rather sink then swim

Sing it
Eyes on fire
Your spine is ablaze
Felling any foe with my gaze
And just in time
In the right place
Steadily emerging with grace
