I've waited, oh, so long
For you to come to me
What did I do wrong?
It's all a mystery to me


Baby, I feel it too
What am I supposed to do?
Maybe I've just changed
Or could I be wrong for you?


You, you've got me hanging on a string now
(I'm not a plaything)
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
(Am I your plaything?)


You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
(With my heart, my love)
You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
(With my heart!)


Do you mean to say
That after all this time
I waited like a fool
Now who been changing you?!


You, you've got me hangin' on a string now
(I'm not your plaything)
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
(I ain't no plaything)
You, you've got me hangin' on a string now
(stop masquerading)
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
(I ain't your plaything)


You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
Come on, child, take me by the hand


You, you've got me hanging on a string now
(I'm not no plaything!)
Stop hanging on the bus, I'm waiting on you
(no no no)
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
Hang on, hang on yeah
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
(Just a plaything)
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
(You never told me)
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
(I didn't know)
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
Come on child, take me by the hand
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
(I'm not no plaything!)
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
