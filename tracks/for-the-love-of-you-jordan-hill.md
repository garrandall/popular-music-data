Tell me what can I say
Baby, what can I do just to get through to you
My head is spinning around
Feelings turning to blue
Baby don't you know it's true

I walk each day down the street where you live
I've waited for the right time
Something's gotta give
I'd try to say it
But the words come out wrong
So listen while I sing you this song

Here is my heart
Here is my soul
Take what you want, baby
Don't ever let go
'Cause every little thing that I do
I do it for the love of
Do it for the love of you

Every time that you hurt
You know I'm feeling it too, baby
Don't you know it's right
'Cause every day that I live
I dedicate it to you each and every night

I tried to play it time after time
But the kind of rush you give me
I could never hide
So listen to these words that I say
Won't let you go, no how, no way

Here is my heart
Here is my soul
Take what you want, baby
Don't ever let go
'Cause every little thing that I do
I do it for the love of
Do it for the love of you

I walk each day down the street where you live
I've waited for the right time
Something's gotta give
I'd try to say it
But the words come out wrong
So listen while I sing you this song

Here is my heart
Here is my soul
Take what you want, baby
Don't ever let go
'Cause every little thing that I do
I do it for the love of
Do it for the love of you
