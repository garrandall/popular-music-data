If you were a woman and I was a man
(If you were a woman and I was a man)
If you were a woman and I was a man
(If you were a woman and I was a man)

Oh, oh, eh, oh
Oh, oh, eh, oh
If you were a woman and I was a man

How's it feel to be a woman?
How's it feel to be a man?
Are we really that different?
Tell me where you stand

I look at you, you look away
Why do you say we're night and day?
I'd like to try another way
Oh, darling! For just one day

If you were a woman and I was a man
Would it be so hard to understand?
That a heart's a heart and we do what we can
If you were a woman and I was a man

Oh, oh, eh, oh
Oh, oh, eh, oh
If you were a woman and I was a man

How's it feel to be the hunter?
How's it feel to be the prey?
Is there really a reason
For this game we play?
I look at you, you look away
Why do you say we're night and day?
I'd like to try another way
Oh, baby, for just one day!

If you were a woman and I was a man
Would it be so hard to understand?
That a heart's a heart and we do what we can
If you were a woman and I was a man
If you were a woman and I was a man

Hey!
We're just two people trying to love
Oh, but how... how can we love?
With this wall between us...
Holding us back!

If you were a woman and I was a man
Would it be so hard to understand?
That a heart's a heart and we do what we can
If you were a woman and I was a man

If you were a woman and I was a man
Would it be so hard to understand?
That a heart's a heart and we do what we can
If you were a woman and I was a man
If you were a woman and I was a man
