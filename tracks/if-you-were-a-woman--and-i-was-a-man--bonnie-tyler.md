If you were a woman and I was a man
Would it be so hard to understand?
That a heart's heart and we do what we can
If you were a woman and I was a man...
I was a man!

How's it feel to be a woman?
How's it feel to be a man?
Are we really that different?
Tell me where we stand

I look at you, you look away
Why do you say we're night and day?
I'd like to try another way
Oh, baby! For just one day

If you were a woman and I was a man
Would it be so hard to understand?
That a heart's a heart and we do what we can
If you were a woman and I was a man
If you were a woman and I was a man

How's it feel to be the hunter?
How's it feel to be the prey?
Is there really a reason
For this game we play?
I look at you, you look away
Why do you say we're night and day?
I'd like to try another way
Oh, darling, for just one day!

If you were a woman and I was a man
Would it be so hard to understand?
That a heart's a heart and we do what we can
If you were a woman and I was a man
If you were a woman and I was a man

Hey!

Hey, hey!

We're just two people trying to love
Oh, but how... how can we love?
With this wall between us...
Holding us!
Holding us back!

If you were a woman and I was a man
Would it be so hard to understand?
That a heart's a heart and we do what we can
If you were a woman and I was a man
If you were a woman and I was a man
If you were a woman and I was a man

Oh! If you were a woman and I was a man
Would it be so hard to understand?
That a heart's a heart and we do what we can
If you were a woman and I was a man

If you were a woman and I was a man
Would it be so hard to understand?
That a heart's a heart and we do what we can
If you were a woman and I was a man
If you were a woman and I was a man

Oh! If you were a woman and I was a man
Would it be so hard to understand?
That a heart's a heart and we do what we can
If you were a woman and I was a man

I was a man!
