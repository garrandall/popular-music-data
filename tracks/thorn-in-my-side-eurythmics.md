You gave me such a bad time
tried to hurt me, but now I know

Thorn in my side.
You know that's all you ever were.
A bundle of lies.
You know that's all that it was worth...
I should have known better
But I trusted you at first.
I should have known better
But I got what I deserved...

To run away from you
Was all that I could do.
To run away from you
Was all that I could do.

Thorn in my side.
You know that's all you'll ever be.
So don't think you know better
'Cause that's what you mean to me...
I was feeling complicated.
I was feeling low.
Now everytime I think of you
I shiver to the bone...
