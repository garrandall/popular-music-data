It's too bad not to know
I don't know
I hurt you so
Baby, talk to me

I'm so sad
I can't wait
Baby, please don't hesitate
Baby, talk to me


You never try to
Talk your feelings through
Communications start from me to you

We have to talk it through
To clear the air
We've got to talk to
Show the love we share


Baby talk
We can work it out
Baby talk
I know without a doubt

Baby talk
We can work it out
Baby talk


Baby, please talk to me
Can't you see you're hurting me
Baby, talk to me

We can see all this through
Talk will help love me and you
Baby, talk to me


It's hard to tell
When things start going wrong
We'll have to talk now
Before too long

So, honey, let's not throw our love away
Let's try to work it out
Before too late




You don't have to worry, baby
You don't have to fear
Tell me all the things you feel
And I will make you care

You just need to tell me, baby
What I need to say
I need to let you love me, baby
In that special way

You just need to tell me, baby
What I need to say
I need to let you love me, baby
In that special way



Baby talk
Baby talk
Baby talk
Baby talk

Baby talk
Baby talk
Baby talk
Baby talk


Baby talk
We can work it out
Baby talk
I know without a doubt

Baby talk
We can work it out
Baby talk

Baby talk
We can work it out
Baby talk
I know without a doubt

Baby talk
We can work it out
Baby talk

Baby talk
We can work it out
Baby talk
I know without a doubt

Baby talk
We can work it out
Baby talk
