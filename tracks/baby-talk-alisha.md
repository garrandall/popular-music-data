The mirror's cracking, baby 
For seven years I've told you 
What's your sexonica is 
The demon in your pocket, yeah 
And quickly like a rush 
You get the stress 
And it's all crazy more or less 
And something's triggering 
And it's a little wonder 
You still look pretty 
But underneath it's a rage 
Everybody says slow down 
You gotta level out 
You won't blow away the pain 

The fire is hot now, baby 
(fire is hot now, baby) 
And hot can burn you 
You are keeping words inside 
And you have got to learn to exhale 
And every time we talk it's like 
Your ego manifests, but then 
I guess something's triggering 

And it's a little wonder 
You still look pretty 
But underneath it's a rage 
Everybody says slow down 
You gotta level out 
You won't blow away the pain 

It's a little wonder 
You still look pretty 
But underneath it's a rage (rage) 
Everybody says slow down 
You gotta level out 
You won't blow away the pain 

(la la la la la..) 
Something's triggering.. 

And it's a little wonder 
You still look pretty 
But underneath it's a rage 
Everybody says slow down (slow down) 
You gotta level out (level out) 
You won't blow away the pain 

The fire is hot now 
And hot can burn you 
You are keeping words inside 
And you have got to learn to exhale 
(la la la la la..) 
And every time we talk it's like 
Your ego manifests, but then 
I guess something's triggering 
(what's your sexonica?) 
Yeah
