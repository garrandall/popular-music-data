Ah now said I love a girl and-a Ruby is her name
This girl don't love me but I love her just the same
(Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Ruby, Ruby, I'm-a want ya
Like a ghost I'm-a gonna haunt ya
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby will you be mine?, sometime

Ah each time I see you, baby my heart cries
I tell ya I'm gonna steal you away from all those guys
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, from the happy day I met ya
Now I made a bet that I was going to get ya
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby will you be mine?


"Hey-hey " overlaid with (Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, baby)
"Hey-hey " overlaid with (Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, baby)
"Hey-hey " overlaid with (Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, baby)
"Hey-hey " overlaid with (Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, baby)


"Hey-hey " overlaid with (Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, baby)}
Well, I tell ya

Now I love this girl I said-a Ruby is her name
When this girl looks at me she just sets my soul aflame
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, I got some hugs and-a kisses, too
Yeah and now I'm gonna give-a them all to you
Now, listen, now Ruby, Ruby, when will you be mine?


"Hey-hey " overlaid with (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

Ah listen, listen, listen, now
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby will you be (fade's out)
