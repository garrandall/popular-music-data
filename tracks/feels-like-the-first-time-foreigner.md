I would climb any mountain
Sail across a stormy sea
If that's what it takes me, baby
To show you how much you mean to me


And I guess it's just the woman in you
That brings out the man in me
I know I can't help myself
You're all in the world to me


(It feels like the first time)
(Feels like the very first time)
(It feels like the first time)
(It feels like the very first time)


I have waited a lifetime
Spent my time so foolishly
But now that I've found you
Together we'll make history


And I know that it must be the woman in you
That brings out the man in me
I know I can't help myself
You're all that my eyes can see


And it feels like the first time
Like it never did before
Feels like the first time
Like we've opened up the door
Feels like the first time
Like it never will again
Never again


(Feels like the first time)
It feels like the first time
(It feels like the very first time)
Very first, feels
(It feels like the first time)
Oh, it feels like the first time
(Feels like the very first time)


Open up the door
Won't you open up the door? Yeah


(Feels like the first time)
(And it feels like the very first time)
(And it feels like the very first time)
(It feels like the very first time)


(And it feels like the first time)
(It feels like the very first time)
Oh, it feels
(Feels like the first time)
Yeah, it feels like the first time
(Feels like the very first time)
