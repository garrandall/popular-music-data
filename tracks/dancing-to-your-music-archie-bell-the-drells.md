(Dancing to your music)
I remember when I was
The captain in command
But now I'm dancing
To your music, baby
(Dancing to your music)
Cause you got the upper hand

Never had the nerve before
To get up on the floor
I'm spinning round and round
Really getting down
Got me screaming for more

You tell me, dance, man
Get on down
Clap your hands, man
I listen to the sound
The band is putting down

Dancing to your music
Anything you tell me, girl
You know that I'll do it

I'll stand on my head for you
If you want me to
I'll cut you a rug
Cause I'm so in love
So in love with you

Dancing, do your thing
Clap your hands, man
I'm dancing to the sound
The band is putting down

I'm dancing to your music
Anything you tell me, girl
You know that I'll do it

I'll break down on my knees
Girl, you really got me on my toes
I'm scared you'll put me outdoors

I'm dancing to your music
Anything you tell me, girl
You know that I'll do it

I'm dancing to your music
Anything you tell me, girl
You know that I'll do it
