I need a taxi, she's so hot fresh
In the serious love reaction
Give it to me 'cause I need your love
Woman heal me, feel my heart beat

Keep this body from a dangerous over heat
Give it to me 'cause I need your love
Emergency, emergency
I need love, I need you, I need a cure, what should I do?
Give it to me, urgent, your love, emergency

Sunday, I'm growing so strong
With every touch, baby
Of your electric body
You rescued me from the fire of heart-break

And you knew just what I should take
Thank you girl for my survival
And a love so strong, you feel so good
It's so much more than physical

Everything is, oh, so beautiful
Girl, I need deep in my system

Love your cool and so a dripping
Give it to me, urgent
'Cause I need your love
Emergency, emergency
Sweet sensations dancing through us
As we're making love

Give it to me, urgent, I need your love, baby
Emergency, emergency
You energize me, standing beside me

Love and affection, give satisfaction
Give it to me, emergency, emergency

Sunday, I'm growing so strong
You energize me, standing beside me

Love and affection give satisfaction
Give it to me, urgent, I need your love, baby
Emergency, emergency

Emergency, urgent
Emergency, as we're making love
Give it to me, urgent 'cause I need your love
Emergency, emergency
You energize me, standing beside me

Love and affection give satisfaction
