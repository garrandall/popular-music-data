If you want me, come and get me
You don't have a chance if you don't move now
I'm no waiting any longer
You know that I'm playing to win this time

When you make your move, I won't hesitate
If you take too long, you could be too late
This time I'm playing to win

If you want me, come and say it
Don't wait around for another chance
Make your mind up, make your play
You should be playing to win this time

When you make your move, I won't hesitate
If you take too long, you could be too late
This time I'm playing to win

All those wasted years, I didn't know I was only emotion away
I got what I wanted from me, but I didn't see it was not what I needed
I was a fool, this time I'm playing to win

If you want me, come and get me
You don't have a chance if you don't move now
I'm no waiting any longer
You know that I'm playing to win this time

When you make your move, I won't hesitate
If you take too long, you could be too late
This time I'm playing to win
When you make your move, I won't hesitate
If you take too long, you could be too late
This time I'm playing to win
This time I'm playing to win
This time I'm playing to win
This time I'm playing to win
