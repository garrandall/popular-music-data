There's so much going on it's crazy trouble all around
I'll tell you something I'm not gonna let it get me down
I been going through some funky changes changes are the same
We like the joy but we can't really stand the pain

I'm just happy to see you and me
Back in stride again
I'm just happy to see you and me
Back in stride again

I'm gonna try to keep it coming things ain't always smooth
But I'll be alright as long as I can feel the groove
Some how I know that I can make it you seem to like my style
Well don't you worry I'm gonna be around awhile

I'm just happy to see you and me
Back in stride again
I'm just happy to see you and me
Back in stride again

Tell you what I'm gonna do
I just want to be with you
Gonna give it all I can
Yes I'm back in stride again

There's so much going on it's crazy trouble all around
I tell you something I'm not gonna let it get me down
I been going through some funky changes changes are the same
We like the joy but we can't really stand the pain

I'm just happy to see you and me
Back in stride again
I'm just happy to see you and me
Back in stride again

Tell you what I'm gonna do
I just want to be with you
Gonna give it all I can
Yes I'm back in stride again

Back in stride again
Back in stride again
Back in stride again
Back in stride again
