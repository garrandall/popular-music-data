Every time I think that I'm the only one who's lonely
Someone calls on me
And every now and then I spend my time in rhyme and verse
And curse those faults in me


And then along comes Mary
And does she want to give me kicks
And be my steady chick and give me pick of memories
Or maybe rather gather tales
From all the fails and tribulations no one ever sees
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now, my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch


When vague desire is the fire in the eyes of chicks
Whose sickness is the games they play
And when the masquerade is played the neighbor folks make jokes
At who is most to blame today


And then along comes Mary
And does she want to set them free
And let them see reality from where she got her name
And will they struggle much when told
That such a tender touch as hers will make them not the same?
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now, my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch

And when the morning of the warning's passed
The gassed and flaccid kids are flung across the stars
The psychodramas and the traumas gone
The songs are left unsung and hung upon the scars


And then along comes Mary
And does she want to see the stains
The dead remains of all the pains she left the night before
Or will their waking eyes reflect the lies
And make them realize their urgent cry for sight no more?
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now, my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch


Sweet as the punch (Sweet as the punch)
Sweet as the punch (Sweet as the punch)
Sweet as the punch (Sweet as the punch)
Sweet as the punch
