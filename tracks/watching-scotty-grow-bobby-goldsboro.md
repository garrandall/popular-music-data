There he sits with a pen and a yellow pad
What a handsome lad
That's my boy
BRLFQ spells "mom and dad"
But that ain't too bad
That's my boy

You can have your TV and your nightclubs
And you can have your drive-in picture show
I'll stay here with my little man near
We'll listen to the radio
Biding my time and watching Scotty grow

Making a castle out of building blocks
And a cardboard box
That's my boy
Mickey Mouse says it's 13:00
Well, that's quite a shock
That's my boy

In four short years
I've gone from rags to riches
And what I did before that
I don't know

So let it rain on my windowpane
I got my own rainbow
And we're sitting here shining
Watching Scotty grow

Riding on daddy's shoulders off to bed
Old sleepy head
That's my boy
Got to have a drink of water and a story read
A teddy bear named Fred
That's my boy

What's that you say, Momma?
Come on and keep you feet warm
Well, save me a place
I'll be there in a minute or so

I think I'll stay right here
And say a little prayer before I go
Me and God watching Scotty grow
Me and God watching Scotty grow
