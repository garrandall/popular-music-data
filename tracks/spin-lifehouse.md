I'd rather chase your shadow all my life
than be afraid of my own 
I'd rather be with you 
I'd rather not know 
where I'll be than be alone and convinced that I know 
and the world keeps spinning round 
my world's upside down and I wouldn't change a thing
I've got nothing else to lose 
I lost it all when I found you and I wouldn't change thing 
no you and I wouldn't change a thing 
everything I know has let me down 
so I will just let go 
let you turn me inside out 
cause I know I'm not sure 
about anything but you wouldn't have it any other way 
and the world keeps spinning round 
my world's upside down and I wouldn't change a thing
I've got nothing else to lose
I lost it all when I found you and I wouldn't change thing
no you and I wouldn't change a thing
spinning, turning, watching, burning
all my life has found its meaning
walking, crawling, climbing, falling
all my life has found its meaning
you and I wouldn't change a thing
no you and I wouldn't change a thing
and the world keeps spinning round
my world's upside down and I wouldn't change a thing
I've got nothing else to lose
I lost it all when I found you and I wouldn't change thing
no you and I wouldn't change a thing
no you and I wouldn't change a thing
