Your conscience has got a hold on you, uh huh huh
You're thinkin' of things you used to do, un huh huh
Things that caused me pain, uh huh huh
Things you can't explain
Ain't it the truth now, baby
Ain't it the truth now, baby

You're hurting deep down inside, uh huh huh
You got a painful look that's in your eyes, yeah yeah yeah 'cause
You remember when, uh huh huh
I said 'You want me back again'
Ain't it the truth now, baby
Ain't it the truth now, baby

Oh oh oh I know you need my love
Now thatƒè everyone has put you down
But that's the story of a love you always needed
When it ain't around

Now you think that you will get me back, uh huh huh
But don't you bet your life on that, no no no 'cause
You did me wrong before, uh huh huh
I don't want you no more
Ain't it the truth now, baby
Ain't it the truth now, baby

'Cause you did me wrong before, uh huh huh
I don't want you no more
Ain't it the truth now, baby
Ain't it the truth now, baby

I don't want you no more
So I don't need your love

(Repeat & fade):
Now ain't it the truth now, baby
