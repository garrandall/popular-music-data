Well come on down to the go go, we're down on the strip
If you want to get hip to a brand new trip
They got a new soul singer, she's really dynamite
Jam up, jelly tight, out of sight, alright, ow!

Well, she may be small, just two feet tall
But if you give her half a chance she'll pin you to the wall
She's a little showstopper, you're gonna have a ball
She can sing, she can dance, she can really do it all, yeah

And now, ladies and gentlemen, without further adue
It is indeed a great pleasure to introduce to you
Held over for three weeks and getting rave reviews
Here's Bridget the midget, the queen of the blues

Here's Bridget, hahahaha
Thank you folks, haha
Thank you

I want to know something
Do you feel alright? (Yeah)
Oh, come on now, you can do better than that
Do you feel alright? (Yeah!)

Wow, that makes me feel so good
Let me hear it again
Do you feel alright? (Yeah!)

Oh, ooohooohooohoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hahahaha

Alright, hahaha
Alright, hahaha
Here we go now
Is everybody ready?

Here we go, everybody sock it to me
Yohohohoho (Yohohohoho), hahahaha
Yohohohoho (Yohohohoho)
Oh, yeaheah! (Yeaheaheah!)

Well, come on everybody have you heard the news
Bridget's in town put on your rockin' shoes
Into my bag and doing my thing
Rock it to me, sock it to me, listen to me sing

Singing oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh I dig it, I really dig it

Hey, get away from the stage there, fellow!

But I dig it

Now folks get ready for an extra special treat
She can lay down a beat she's a real intranser
Here's Bridget the midget and her flying feet
The worlds one and only go-go tapdancer, go!

Hahahaha
Oh!

Oho, I dig it, I really dig it

Hey, sit down, fellwo, you can't come up on the stage

But I dig it, oh!

Now here's the moment we've all waited for
Three singing little cuties that we all adore
You've heard them with Bridget on all of her hits
They lay down a groove and the sound never quits

They got what it takes, there ain't no doubt
Strawberry and The Shortcakes, work it on out, ow!

(Shoobydoo-wop-wop)
(Shoobydoo-wop-wop) Oh, let me hear it!
(Shoobydoo-wop-wop) How precious!
(Shoobydoo-wop-wop)

(Shoobydoo-wop-wop) Yeah
(Shoobydoo-wop-wop)

Well, come on, everybody, have you heard the news?
Bridget's in town, put on your rockin' shoes
Into my bag and doing my thing
Rock it to me, sock it to me, listen to me sing

Singing oh!
(Shoobydoo-wop-wop)
(Shoobydoo-wop-wop)

Oh, I dig it, I really dig it!

Hey, watch it! You can't do that, fellow!

But I dig it, I love you, Bridget!

Get back there, get back!
