Here I am with my head in my hands
With a tear each day of the year
This is not, not at all what I planned (what I planned)
How to say what cannot be clear
I'm going away from you

If I have to go away (if I have to go away)
There'll be time enough to say
Why I ruined a good thing, I'll never know
How I loved and lost the thing I wanted most
Most

There you are, you're so near, yet so far
Out of reach to one who can't speak
Just the past makes me silent and more (more and more)
Makes my mind unable to think
I'm going away from you

If I have to go away (if I have to go away)
There'll be time enough to say
Why I ruined a good thing, I'll never know
How I loved and lost the thing I wanted most
Most

If I have to go away (if I have to go away)
There'll be time enough to say
Why I ruined a good thing, I'll never know
How I loved and lost the thing I wanted most

If I have to go away (if I have to go away)
There'll be time enough to say
Why I ruined a good thing
