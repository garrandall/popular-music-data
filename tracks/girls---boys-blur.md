Streets like a jungle, so call the police
Following the herd down to Greece on holiday
Love in the '90s is paranoid
On sunny beaches, take your chances looking for


Girls who want boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love


Avoiding all work 'cause there's none available
Like battery thinkers, count your thoughts on one, two, three, four, five fingers
Nothing is wasted, only reproduced
You get nasty blisters, du bist sehr sch√∂n, but we haven't been introduced


Girls who want boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love
Girls who want boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone to really love


Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh


Looking for girls who want boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love
Girls who want boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone to really love
Girls who want boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love
Girls who want boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone to really love


Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
