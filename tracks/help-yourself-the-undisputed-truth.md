Ah, I just want to let you people know, yeah
True love is hard to find and that's yourself

Ah, I just want to let you people know
That, my son, when you find the one you want
Don't let it go, no, no, no, no, no

Yeah, I'll send you my loving
If you want me to
I'd do anything you want
If you ask me to

Well, I work my fingers
'Til they're black and blue
All I've got to do is the one thing
I'm gonna ask of me

Help yourself to my love and affection (Mmm-hm)
(Help yourself) All you gotta do is follow me in my direction
(Hey, I'm on my way)
Help yourself to my love that you know you need (Yes, indeed)
(Help yourself) Get yourself a heaping help and help yourself

Ah, you see something you want (Uh-huh)
Go on and get it (Have mercy)
You've got to use what you've got
To get what you want (Amen)

I've got a truck full of loving
It ain't doing nothing
And you've got what it takes
To get what I've got

Ah, help yourself to my love and affection (Hey, I'm coming, girl)
(Help yourself) All you've got to is follow me in my direction (Nothin' can keep you)
You see I've got good love that you need (Yes, indeed)
Get yourself a heaping help and help yourself

Daa-da-da-da-da-da
Daa-da-da-da-da-da-da
Daa-da-da-da-da-da
Daa-da-da-da-da-da-da

We're gonna sing the song
I'll send you my loving
If you want me to (Say, what?)

And I'll do anything you want
If you ask me to (Mercy, girl)

And I'll work my fingers
'Til they're black and blue (Lord, yeah)

All you've got to do
Is the one thing that I ask of you

Help yourself to my love and affection (You don't have to worry, girl)
All you've got to do is start steppin' in my direction (Hey, I'm on my way)
(Help yourself) You see if got good love that you need
(Yes, indeed)
(Help your-) Get yourself a heaping helping and help yourself (Woah-woah-yeah) (C'mon)

Help yourself to my love and affection (Mmm-hm-mm-hm)
All you've got to do is follow me in my direction (I'm gonna follow, baby)
(Help yourself) You see I've got more love than I need (Yes, indeed)
(Help your-) Get yourself a heaping helping and help yourself (Woah-woah-woah-woah, come)
