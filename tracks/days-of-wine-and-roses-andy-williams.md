The days of wine and roses laugh and run away like a child at play
Through the meadow land toward a closing door
A door marked "nevermore" that wasn't there before
The lone-ly night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you



The days of wine and roses



The lonely-----the night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you
