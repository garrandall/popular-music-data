Where would I be, what would I be
If I hadn't had the good book taught to me
I don't know, but I can guess
I'm a lot better off because I've been blessed now

With the love of a mama, a mama and a papa
Thank God I had a mama, a mama and a papa
Who took enough time to care about me now
Teach me how to work, teach me how to pray
Not to treat my brother just any way

Not long ago I wanted to see
Why other people couldn't be as happy as me
It didn't take long for me to find out
There's people in the world that's living without
Hearts full of hate, frown on their face
There's trouble locked up in the whole human race
We gotta snap out of it, got to get rid of it
We got to put a little more love in its place

With the help of a mama, a mama and a papa
Everybody needs a mama, a mama and a papa
Who'll take enough time to care about us now
Teach us how to work, teach us how to pray
Not to treat our brother just any way
Teach us how to work, teach us how to pray
Not to treat our brother just any way

Thank God I had a mama, a mama and a papa
Everybody needs a mama, a mama and a papa
Who'll take enough time to care about us now
Teach us how to work, teach us how to pray
Not to treat our brother just any way
Teach us how to work, teach us how to pray
Not to treat our brother just any way
