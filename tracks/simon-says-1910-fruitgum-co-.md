I'd like to play a game
That is so much fun
And it's not so very hard to do
The name of the game is Simple Simon says
And I would like for you to play it to

Put your hands in the air
Simple Simon says
Shake them all about
Simple Simon says
Do it when Simon says
Simple Simon says
And you will never be out.

Simple Simon says
Put your hands on your head
Let your back bone stretch
Simon says

Simple simon says
Put your hands on your head
Let your back bone stiff
Simon says

Put your hands on your head
Simple Simon says
Bring them down by your side
Simple Simon says
Shake them to your left
Simple Simon Says
Now shake them to your right

Put your hands on your head
Simple Simon says
Bring them down by your side
Simple Simon says
Shake them to your left
Simple Simon Says
Now shake them to your right

Now that you have learnt
To play this game with me
You can see its not so hard to do
Lets try it once again
This time more carefully
And I hope the winner will be you.

Clap your hands in the air
Simple Simon says
Do it double time
Simple Simon says
Slow it down like before
Simple Simon says
Ah, your looking fine.
Simple Simon says
Now clap them high in the air
Simple Simon says
Do it double time
Simple Simon says
Slow it down like before
Simple Simon says
Ah, your looking fine.
