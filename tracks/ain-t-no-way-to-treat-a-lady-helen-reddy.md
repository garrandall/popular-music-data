I guess it was yourself you were involved with
I would have sworn it was me
I might have found out sooner
If you'd only let me close enough to see

That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way
To treat your baby, your woman, your friend
That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way
But maybe it's a way for us to end

I was only being a picture
With all the colors I know
While you were busy looking
Into wide blue mirrors and loving the show

That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way
To treat your baby, your woman, your friend
That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way
But maybe it's a way for us to end

There's a funny kind of consolation keeping me sane
And I'd really like to share it, crawl on deep in my brain
You see the time you never felt me loving you or needing you
So leaving you now, you still won't know how to feel the pain

I was looking out for my happiness
While you were looking within
And before you know your own reflection
Always starts to tire you and it's happened again

That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way
To treat your baby, your woman, your friend
That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way
But maybe it's a way for us to end

That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way
To treat your baby, your woman, your friend
That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way
But maybe it's a way for us to end
