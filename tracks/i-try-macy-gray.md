Games, changes and fears
When will they go from here?
When will they stop?
I believe that fate has brought us here
And we should be together, babe
But we're not


I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you
And I'll keep my cool, but I'm feigning


I try to say goodbye and I choke
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near
Goodbye and I choke
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near


I may appear to be free
But I'm just a prisoner of your love
And I may seem alright and smile when you leave
But my smiles are just a front
Just a front, hey


I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you
And I'll keep my cool, but I'm feigning


I try to say goodbye and I choke (Yeah)
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near
Goodbye and I choke (Yeah)
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near


Here is my confession
May I be your possession?
Boy, I need your touch
Your love, kisses, and such
With all my might, I try
But this I can't deny
Deny


I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you
(But I'm dreaming of you, babe)
I'll keep my cool, but I'm feigning


I try to say goodbye and I choke (Yeah)
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide, it it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near
Goodbye and I choke (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I try to walk away and I stumble (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Though I try to hide, it it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near (Your love kisses and such)
Goodbye and I choke (Goodbye and I choke, yeah)
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near


Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
