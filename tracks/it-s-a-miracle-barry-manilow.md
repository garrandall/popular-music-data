You wouldn't believe where Iâve been
The city and towns I been in
From Boston to Denver
And every town in between

The people they all look the same
Only the names have been changed
But now that I'm home again
I'll tell you what I believe

Itâs a miracle
A true blue spectacle
A miracle come true
We're together, baby, I was goin' crazy
Till the miracle
Came through
Now you're here, and my arms are around you
And baby, there'll be
Dancin' in the streets
For the miracle
A true blue spectacle
The miracle is you

I never knew you look so good
I never knew anyone could
I must have been crazy
To ever had gone away

I almost for got what it's like
Holdin' you near me at night
But now that Iâm home again
You know that Iâm home to stay

'Cause itâs a miracle
A true blue spectacle
A miracle come true
We're together baby, I was goin' crazy
Till the miracle came through
Now you're here and Iâm feelin' so good
And baby there'll be
Dancin' in the streets
For the miracle
A true blue spectacle
The miracle is you

Now you're here and my arms are around you
And baby there'll be dancing in the street
There's going to be dancing in the street
Dancing in the street

Dancin', dancin', dancin', dancin'
Dancin' in the street
Dancin', dancin', dancin' in the street
For the miracle
A true blue spectacle
The miracle is you
Hey the miracle is you
The miracle is you
