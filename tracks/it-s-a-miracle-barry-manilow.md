You wouldn't believe where I've been
The cities and towns I've been in
From Boston to Denver
And every town in between


(Everyone looks the same)
The people they all look the same
(Yes, the same)
Oh, only the names have been changed
(Just the names)
But now that I'm home again
I'll tell you what I believe


It's a miracle (miracle)
A true blue spectacle
A miracle come true
(Whoa ohh ohh ohh)
We're together, baby
I was going crazy
Till the miracle came through
(Ohh ohh ohh ohh)
Now you're here and my arms are around you
And, baby, there'll be dancing in the street
For the miracle (miracle)
A true blue spectacle
The miracle is you
(Woo! Hoo hoo hoo hoo)
(Hoo!)


I never knew you looked so good
Oh, I never knew anyone could
I must have been crazy
To ever have gone away


(Almost forgot you, babe)
I almost forgot what it's like
(Every night)
Oh, holding you near me at night
(Every night)
But now that I'm home again
You know that I'm home to stay


'Cause it's a miracle (miracle)
A true blue spectacle
A miracle come true
(Whoa ohh ohh ohh)
We're together, baby
I was going crazy
Till the miracle came through
(Ohh ohh ohh ohh)
Now you're here and I'm feeling so good
And, baby, there'll be dancing in the street
For the miracle (miracle)
A true blue spectacle
The miracle is you
(Woo! Hoo hoo hoo hoo)
(Hoo!)


Now you're here and my arms are around you
And, baby, there'll be dancing in the street
Ha, there's gonna be dancing in the street
Whoa ohh ohh ohh
Dancing in the street


(Dancing in the street)
Dancing, dancing, dancing
(Dancing in the street)
Dancing, dancing, dancing
(Dancing in the street)
Dancing, dancing, dancing
(Dancing in the street)


For the miracle (miracle)
A true blue spectacle
The miracle is you
(Hoo! The miracle is you)
Hey, the miracle is you
(Hoo! The miracle is you)
Whoa, the miracle is you
(Hoo! The miracle is)
