Lately, I Been Thinkin Bout You Goin Crazy
Can't Go On Without U In My Life Its True
Wat U Wanna Do
U Can Be My Boyfriend
I Can Be Your Girlfriend


Here There Q-Tip? Ha Whats The Deal?
Had To Let U Kno How I Feel
Had A Bunch Of Girls, But Ima Keep It Real
Them Otha Chickenheads Couldn't Foot The Bill
But You, Its Somethin About Ya Baby
What It Is? I Dont Know
Maybe 'cause Ya Body Just Right
Wit A Sexy Smile
And You Know How To Get That Dough
Plus The Heart For Red Just Like Bo ("Q")
Feel Me Up, When Im Feelin Low
When Im Home Or Out The Road, No Questions Asked
You Know Its On As Soon As I Hit The Door, (Fa Sho!)
And I Need That On My Team
Baby U Was Made For Me
Had Somethin On My Mind
And Forgot Wat It Was, And Thats Because...


Lately, I Been Thinkin Bout You Goin Crazy
Can't Go On Without U In My Life Its True
Wat U Wanna Do
U Can Be My Boyfriend
I Can Be Your Girlfriend


OhWee! Look At That There
Call Me Sunny, I Need My Share
Love A (Spring?) Redbone, With Long Hair
Got Her Act Together Like A Broad Wit A ?
U The Only One For Me, Im The Only One For U
Ain't Nobody Gon Take Yo Place
Take A Look At My Myspace Page
She The Numba Position On My Top 8
Lets Go Somewhere, And Chill
Baby Girl Got, Sex Appeal
Ima Show U, How I Feel
Never Met A Woman So Real
And Thats Fa Sho, I Take Ya To The Mall Ona Shoppin Spree
Spendin That Dough, It Ain't Tricky? If U Got It And I Got This Cheese..


Lately, I Been Thinkin Bout You Goin Crazy
Can't Go On Without U In My Life Its True
Wat U Wanna Do
U Can Be My Boyfriend
I Can Be Your Girlfriend


See I Want Us, To Be In A Relationship
Are U Ready Baby? Lets Go Steady Baby
I Want U, And If U Want Me To
U Should Be My Boyfriend, I Can Be Yo Girl Friend


Shawty I Can't Waste No Time
You Know U Been On My Mind
In The Mornin, When I Sleep At Night
When I Work, You There And It Ain't No Lie
At First I Ain't Wanna Sweat Ya
Now It Feel Like Im Under Pressure
We Was Cool Ass Friends
Now What The Deal Is?
I Dont Know But I Gots Ta Get Ya


Lately, I Been Thinkin Bout You Goin Crazy
Can't Go On Without U In My Life Its True
Wat U Wanna Do
U Can Be My Boyfriend
I Can Be Your Girlfriend


See I Can Foot The Bill
You Know I Keep It Real
And When You Come Up Off The Road
You Got Somwhere To Chill
Make Me Ya Lady
Youll Be My Man
Its Obvious That I Should Be Ya Girlfriend!


Lately, I Been Thinkin Bout You Goin Crazy
Can't Go On Without U In My Life Its True
Wat U Wanna Do
U Can Be My Boyfriend
I Can Be Your Girlfriend
