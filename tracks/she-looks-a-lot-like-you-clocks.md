I saw her picture on the cover
Somebody's photogenic lover
But when I looked into her eyes
I was taken by surprise
I thought I recognized her


She looks a lot like you
She looks a lot like you
She looks a lot like you

Don't tell me looks can be deceiving
I have a hard time beliving

If she could touch me with a smile
Her whole mouth is out of style
I don't know a lot about her



I don't know if I
Should act the way I do
What else can I do

I don't know if I
Should feel the way I do
What else could I do
I had her and not you
She looked a lot like you
