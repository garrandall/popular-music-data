Pilot of the Airwaves, here is my request
You don't have to play it but I hope you'll do your best
I've been listening to your show on the radio
And you seem like a friend to me


Or the record of your choice, I don't mind
I'd be  happy just to hear your voice
Saying this is for the girl who didn't sign her name
I guess she needs a dedication just the same


Late at night I'm still listening
Don't waste my time chasing sleep
People say I look weary
But that's just the company I keep
Ooh, you make the night time race
Ooh, I don't need to see your face
You're sounding good (You're sounding good)
Sounding good to me


Pilot of the Airwaves, here is my request
You don't have to play it but I hope you'll do your best
I've been listening to your show on the radio
And you seem like a friend to me



Ahh, Ahh


Late at night I'm still listening
Don't waste my time chasing sleep
People say I look weary
But that's just the company I keep
Ooh, you make the night time race
Ooh, I don't need to see your face
You're sounding good (You're sounding good)
Sounding good to me


Pilot of the Airwaves, here is my request
You don't have to play it but I hope you'll do your best
I've been listening to your show on the radio
And you seem like a friend to me

Chorus/Outro
Pilot of the Airwaves, here is my request
You don't have to play it but I hope you'll do your best
I've been listening to your show on the radio
And you seem like a friend to me
