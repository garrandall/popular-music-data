What's new?
How is the world treating you
You haven't changed a bit
Handsome as ever I must admit

What's new?
How did that romance come through
We haven't met since then
Gee but it's nice to see you again

What's new?
Probably I'm boring you
But seeing you is grand
And you were sweet to offer your hand
I understand

Adieu
Pardon my asking what's new
Of course you couldn't know
I haven't changed
I still love you so

Adieu
Pardon my asking what's new
Of course you couldn't know
I haven't changed
I still love you so
