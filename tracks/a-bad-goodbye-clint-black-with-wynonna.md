I've been bound to leave you, we've known that for a while
I'm sure it's something I can't do
If I can't leave you with a smile
I don't know how far I'll have to go
'Til I'm sure those eyes won't cry
And in my mind I've left enough to know
That I can't leave you with a bad goodbye

Goodbye, easier said than done
Goodbye
There's no good when you're the one
Whose goodbye you swore would never come
And in my goodbye you're finding none

I'm still bound to leave you, I surely don't know how
My heart won't let me put you through
What my mind said should happen now
I don't know where we'll go from here
There may be no way to fly
And the cloud I'm in just makes it all too clear
That I can't leave you with a bad goodbye

Goodbye, easier said than done
Goodbye
There's no good when you're the one
Whose goodbye you swore would never come
And in my goodbye you're finding none

How can we be so far between
Where we are and one more try
And any way I look I've only seen
That I can't leave you with a bad goodbye
