Need a helping hand of all the people in the world
I hoped you'd understand
You and me have grown so far apart
Don't show me faded photographs, just tell it from the heart

And after all that we've been through
Don't you know I feel for you
We've got nothing in common
So much to lose, yeah yeah yeah

You say that boys must never cry if we keep our feelings to ourselves
We'll be boys until we die, oh yeah
Inside this velvet glove, there's always been an iron fist
Destroying all we love

And after all that we've been through
Don't you know I feel for you
We've got nothing in common
So much to lose, yeah yeah yeah

And after all that we've been through
Don't you know I feel for you
We've got nothing in common
So much to lose, yeah yeah yeah

Oh, now there were times I wanted to shake you
Break you, bring you to your knees
Oh, now there were times I wanted to touch you
Hold you, help me, help me please

Whoa, o-whoa, such a crying shame
You know I loved you then
You know I love you now
And nothing else has changed

And after all that we've been through
Don't you know I feel for you
We've got nothing in common
So much to lose, yeah yeah yeah

After all that we've been through
Don't you know I feel for you
We've got nothing in common
So much to lose

After all that we've been through
Don't you know I feel for you
We've got nothing in common
So much to lose
