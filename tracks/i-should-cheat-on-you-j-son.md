You keep saying
I’m creeping
And I keep explaining for no reason
Cause I’m not cheating

But I’m thinking
Since I go through
What’s the difference if I do, babe?


What can I say?
(What can I say?)
You don’t believe me anyway
(Anyway)
I should just cheat on you
(On you)

What (what)
Can I do? (can I do?)
Girl, you keep accusing me
(Oh, you)
I should just cheat on you
(You)


You keep saying you love me
But save it, baby
You don’t trust me

Caught you checking my pager
If I was cheating
I would have erased it
(Tell me, babe, why?)

Must everywhere you go be on the down low?
If you wasn't creeping
Tell me why

If I told you
You’d say it was untrue
I keep denying
Sick of trying
Maybe I should lie to you



I should just
I should just cheat on you
I should just
I should just cheat on you
I should just
I should just cheat on you

What you gon’, gon’, gon’ do?


Please, please, please
How you gonna play me?
Now you gonna make me cheat, cheat, cheat
Got me going crazy
I thought I was your baby



Please, please, please
Cheat, cheat, cheat
Got me going crazy
I thought I was your baby
What can I say?
