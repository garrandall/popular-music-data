Now have you got yourself a brand new baby
Don't tell me maybe
Is it so
I got to know
What's it gonna be
Him or me
Him or me
Him or me
Him or me

I can still recall when you told me I was all
Everything you looked for in a man
But I know that it's not true
I've seen the way he looks at you
And I thing you're gonna hang me up again

Now have you got yourself a brand new baby
Don't tell me maybe
Is it so
I got to know
What's it gonna be
Him or me
Him or me
Him or me
Him or me

So if you'd like to be so kind
Would you please make up your mind
I won't share your lovin' with another man
And if you see things my way
Won't you let me know today
But if you decide it's him
I'll change my mind

So have you got yourself a brand new baby
Don't tell me maybe
Is it so
I got to know
What's it gonna be
Him or me
Him or me
Him or me
Him or me

Him or me
Him or me
Him or me 
Him or me
What's it gonna be

Him or me
Him or me 
Him or me
What's it gonna be

Him or me
Him or me 
Him or me
What's it gonna be
