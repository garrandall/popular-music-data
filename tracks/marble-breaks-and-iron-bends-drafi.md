If the sun doesn't always shine
Dum dum dum dum
Just remember that you are mine
Dum dum dum dum

(CHORUS)
Marble breaks and iron bends
But our love will never end
After all is said and done
You're the only one

Should I ever be far away
Dum dum dum dum
My love is with you night and day
Dum dum dum dum

(CHORUS) 2X

Til I give you a band of gold
Dum dum dum dum
Take my heart now to have and hold
Dum dum dum dum

(CHORUS) 3X
