Making love in the rain
I can't believe the
Joy it brings me
Making love all alone
I hear the rain on my window

It's just a little thing
But it means so much to me
Our bodies together while
The rain plays a melody

Every raindrop
Makes think of you
(Wishing you
Were close to me)
There is nothing
That I'd rather do than

Making love in the rain
I can't believe the
Joy it brings me
Making love all alone
I hear the rain on my window

When it's stormy outside
It's warm in my heart
With you in my arms

And when you're away from me
I wish it would rain
Cause it's always the same

Every raindrop
Makes think of you
(Wishing you
Were close to me)
There is nothing
That I'd rather do than

Making love in the rain
I can't believe the
Joy it brings me
(I can't believe)
When we're done, all alone
I hear the rain on my window
(On my window)

Making love in the rain
I can't believe the
Joy it brings me
(Making love)

Making love all alone
I hear the rain on my window
(On my window)
(I hear the raindrops flow)

Every raindrop
Makes think of you
(Wishing you were
Close to me)
There is nothing
That I'd rather do than

Making love in the rain
I can't believe the
Joy it brings me
(Making love)

When we're here all alone
I hear the rain on my window
(On my window, I hear it)

Making love in the rain
I can't believe the
Joy it brings me

All alone, I hear the rain
My love, here comes the rain
My love, here comes the rain
My love, here comes the rain
My love, here comes the rain
