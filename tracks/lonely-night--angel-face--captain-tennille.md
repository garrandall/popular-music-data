Lonely night, I cry myself to sleep
Tell me, what am I gonna do

'Cause it's always been you to dry my tears
It's always been you to wash away my fears
It's always been you each night and day
Now what can I say when love slips away?

Lonely night, I'm walking the floor
Tell me, what am I gonna do

Without your precious love, your tender touch
Hey, little girl, I miss you so much
Wish we could turn back the hands of time
To the day when you were mine

You used to call me angel face
Used to call me angel face
You used to help me through the night
Make me feel all right
Now all I have is teardrops through a lonely night

I can't get ya out of my mind
I can't get ya out of my mind
I can't get ya out of my mind

I promise you I'll change my ways
I promise you love's here to stay
Hey, little girl, depend on me

I'll be yours for eternity

You used to call me angel face
Used to call me angel face
You used to help me through the night
Make me feel all right
Now all I have is teardrops through a lonely night

You used to call me angel face
Used to call me angel face
You used to help me through the night
Make me feel all right
Now all I have is teardrops through a lonely night

I can't get ya out of my mind
I can't get ya out of my mind
I can't get ya out of my mind
I can't get ya out of my mind
I can't get ya out of my mind
I can't get ya out of my mind
