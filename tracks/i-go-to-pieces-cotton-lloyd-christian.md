When I see you
Walking down the street
I get so shaky
And I feel so weak

I tell my eyes
Look the other way
But they don't listen
To hear a word I say


And I go to pieces
And I wanna hide
Go to pieces and I almost die
Every time my baby passes by

I tell my arms
They'll hold someone new
Another love that will be true

But they don't listen
They don't seem to care
They reach for her
But she's not there



I remember what
She said when she said
Goodbye, baby
We'll meet again soon maybe

But until we do
All my best to you
I'm so lonely
I think about her only

I go to places we used to go
But I know she'll never show
She hurt me so much inside
Now I hope she's satisfied



Go to pieces and I die
Every time my baby passes by
I go to pieces and I die
Every time my baby passes by

I go to pieces and I die
Every time my baby passes by
I go to pieces and I die...
