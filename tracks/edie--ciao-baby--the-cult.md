Always said you were a Youthquaker, Edie
A stormy little world shaker
Warhol's darling queen, Edie
An angel with a broken wing

The dogs lay at your feet, Edie
We carressed your cheek
Stars wrapped in your hair, Edie
Life without a care
But you're not there

Caught up in an endless scene, Edie
Paradise a shattered dream
Wired on the pills you took, Edie
Your innocence dripped blood, sweet child

The dogs lay at your feet, Edie
We carressed your cheek
Stars wrapped in your hair
Life without a care
Ciao, baby!

Sweet little sugar talker
Paradise dream stealer
Warhol's little queen, Edie
An angel with a broken wing

The dogs lay at your feet, Edie
We carressed your cheek, well
Stars wrapped in your hair
Life without a care

Why did you kiss the world goodbye
Ciao, Baby!
Don't you know paradise takes time
Ciao, Edie!

Why did you kiss the world goodbye
Ciao, Baby!
Don't you know paradise takes time
Ciao, Edie!

Ciao, Baby!
Ciao, Baby!
Ciao, Baby!
Ciao, Baby!
