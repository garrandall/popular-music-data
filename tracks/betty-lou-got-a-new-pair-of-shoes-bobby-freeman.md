Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes (whooo)
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou ah-whoo, ah-whoo, ah-whoo
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes

Well she walked in the shoe-store, picked out a shoe
She tried on a twelve, but that wouldn't do

Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou bought a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou ah-whoo, ah-whoo, ah-whoo
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes

Well, she cracked up over the solid fit
Walkin' down the street with her brand new kit

Well, she's walkin' down the street, she met an undertaker
He tried to burry her new shudebakers

Well, she went to a rock 'n' roll party the other night
Someone stepped on her shudebakers and she started a fight!

Well, she walked in the shoe-store, gave the man a tip
She told him to go buy himself a rocketship
