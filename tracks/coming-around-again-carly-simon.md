Baby sneazes
Mommy pleases
Daddy breezes in.
So good on paper
So romantic
So bewildering

I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's coming around again.
So don't mind if I fall apart
There's more room in a broken heart (broken heart)

Pay the grocer
Fix the toaster
Kiss the host goodbye.
Then you break a window
Burn the soufflae
Scream the lullaby

I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's coming around again.
So don't mind if I fall apart
There's more room in a broken heart

I believe in love, But what else can I do, I'm so in love with you.

I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's coming around again, coming around again, coming around again...

I know nothing stays the same (I believe in love)
But if you're willing to play the game (I believe in love)
It's coming around again

I do believe, and I do believe in love.

I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's coming around again.

(I believe in love)
