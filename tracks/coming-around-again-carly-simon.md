Baby sneezes
Mommy pleases
Daddy breezes in

So good on paper
So romantic
But so bewildering

I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's coming around again

So don't mind if I fall apart
There's more room in a broken heart (Broken heart)

You pay the grocer
Fix the toaster
You kiss the host goodbye

Then you break a window
Burn the souffle
Scream a lullaby

I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's coming around again

So don't mind if I fall apart
There's more room in a broken heart (Broken heart)

And I believe in love
But what else can I do
I'm so in love with you

I know nothing stays the same (Stays the same)
But if you're willing to play the game (Play the game)
It's coming around again

(Baby sneezes) (I believe in love)
(Mommy pleases) (I believe in love)
(Daddy breezes in) (I believe in love)

I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It will be coming around again

I do believe, I do believe (I believe in love)
I believe in love (I believe in love)
I believe in love (I believe in love)
Coming around again, coming around again

I know nothing stays the same (I believe in love)
But if you're willing to play the game (I believe in love)
It will be coming around again (I believe in love)

I believe in love (I believe in love)
I believe in love (I believe in love)
But it's coming around again

Oooh!
