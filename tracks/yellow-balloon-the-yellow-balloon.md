I never liked the rain before
It always made me stay inside
There's one thing that I know for sure
I got a reaon to like it
Since you took me for a rainbow ride

It's raining, it's pouring
But I don't care no more
It's like a Yellow Balloon
(AH...
On a rainy afternoon (AH...
And love's a Yellow Balloon

I never felt this way before
It's a feeling that I can't explain
There's one thing that I know for sure
I can tell you're feeling it too
'Cause when I'm walking with you in the rain
(It's like a Yellow Balloon)

(Ilove you, yes I do
And I know you love me too)
But raindrops keep falling on the street
I don't care, 'cause when we meet
I know the sky's gonna get lighter
The sun's gonna shine a little brighter
Like a Yellow Balloon
On a rainy afternoon
And love's a Yellow Balloon

(BA...)

It's like the Yellow Balloon
On a rainy afternoon
And love's a Yellow Balloon
Love's a Yellow Balloon
It's like the Yellow Balloon
And love's a Yellow Balloon
It's like the Yellow Balloon...
