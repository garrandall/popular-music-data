Rain drippin' off the brim of my hat
Sure is cold today
Here I am walkin' down 66
Wish she hadn't done me that way
Sleepin' under a table in a roadside park
A man could wake up dead
But it sure seems warmer than it did
Sleepin' in my king sized bed
Is anybody goin' to San Antone
Or Phoenix, Arizona?
Any place is all right as long as I
Can forget I've ever known her?
Wind creepin' down the neck of my shirt
Like I ain't got nothin' on
But I'd rather fight the wind and rain
Than what I've been fightin' at home
Yonder comes a truck with the U.S. Mail
People writin' letters back home
Tomorrow she'll probably want me back
But I'll be just as gone
Is anybody goin' to San Antone
Or Phoenix, Arizona?
Any place is all right as long as I
Can forget I've ever known her?
