Imagine there's no heaven
Is easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today

Imagine there's no countries
Isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
No religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world...

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one.
