We're through, I'm through
Good bye, I'll cry
Take care, beware
I hope to tell you that it isn't fair
I got a broken heart
And a pillow filled with tears

Well some day I'm gonna tell you
What you did to me
And how you broke my little heart
Then you set me free

Oh yes I'll tell the world
What you did to this poor girl
And how you fill my mind with doubt and fear

Oh yes I'll tell the world
How you left me all alone
With a broken heart
And a pillow filled with tears

Well someday I'm gonna tell ya
What you said to me
You said you loved me with all your heart
Now you let me be

Oh yes I'll tell the world
What you did to this poor girl
And how you fill my mind with doubt and fear

Oh yes I'll tell the world
How you left me all alone
With a broken heart
And a pillow filled with tears

We're through, I'm blue
Good bye, I'll cry
Take care, beware
I hope to tell you that it isn't fair
I got a broken heart
And a pillow filled with tears

We're through, I'm blue
Good bye, I'll cry
Take care, beware
I hope to tell you that it isn't fair
I got a broken heart
And a pillow filled with tears
