I've got heartaches by the number when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
O, how my heart was filled, when you come home again
But you came back and never meant to stay

Now, I've got heartaches by the number
Troubled by the shore
Ever day I love you more and more
I've got heartaches by the number
It's a love that I can't win
But th day you stop lovin' me
Is th day my world will end

Got heartaches by the number
When you called me and said
You were coming back to stay
With hopeful heart I waited for you
But you must have lost your way
