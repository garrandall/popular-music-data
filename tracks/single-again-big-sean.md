Yeah, what happens when it's too good to throw away?
You either let it go bad, or go away
I need to pray

Take my time (Part Two) Take my time, I'ma take my time
Nah nah nah-nah-nah (Look)
Nah nah nah-nah nah

I'm single again (Single again)
Told 'em we'll be better off friends
Maybe I should just focus on me (On me)
And slow down, don't rush romance
I'm single again (Single again)
Told them that we better off friends (Off friends)
Blaming you is just so easy (Woah)
But maybe the problem's me
I'm single again (Single again)
Guess that's just the way it's gon' be (Gon' be)
Maybe I should spend this time on me (On me)
Maybe I should spend this cash on me (On me)

Instead of blaming all my old girls when I leave (What?)
Instead of calling up these fake hoes that I don't need (What?)
Old relationships turn to new DÃ©jÃ -Vu's
Got me feeling like 'I Don't Fuck With You'
Oh no-no, nah, that's the old me, you fuckin' with the new me
Honestly all the disrespect had damn near ruined me (Damn near)
All the trust gone, seems like all you say is "Prove it to me"
Yeah you know I suck at lying, don't don't do it to me (Don't)
Maybe 'cause my mom had never worked it out with my dad (Damn)
Maybe 'cause he had insecurities and she had 'em bad (Uh-huh)
Maybe 'cause single-parent love is all I had, who knows? (Who knows?)

I'm single again (Single again)
Told 'em we'll be better off friends
Maybe I should just focus on me (On me)
And slow down, don't rush romance
I'm single again (Single again)
Told them that we better off friends (Off friends)
Blaming you is just so easy (Woah)
But maybe the problem's me
I'm single again (Single again)
Guess that's just the way it's gon' be (Gon' be)
Maybe I should spend this time on me (On me)
Maybe I should spend this cash on me (On me)

Take my time, take my time, I'ma take my time (Hold up)
Take my time, I'ma take my time, yeah even if I'm late I'ma take my time

What have you done for yourself?
What have you done for your mental health?
I even tried the drugs and they didn't help
Short-term fix that breaks everything else
And my bros keep throwin' me these random hoes and stallions
I need the 'Best' advice went across the street to Khaled
He said "The major key is to be strong on your own
Lose your other half, you're never off-balance"
Lookin' for the love in somebody else
That I probably shoulda gave to myself
Cycles I need to break in myself
If I'm alone I'm second to no one else, so

I'm single again
Told 'em we'll be better off friends
Maybe I should just focus on me (On me)
And slow down, don't rush romance
I'm single again
Told 'em that we better off friends
Blaming you is just so easy
But maybe the problem's me
I'm single again
Guess that's just the way it's gon' be
Maybe I should spend this time on me
Maybe I should spend this cash on me

Take my time, take my time, I'ma take my time
Take my time, I'ma take my time
Yeah even if I'm late I'ma take my time

Stay on this grind
