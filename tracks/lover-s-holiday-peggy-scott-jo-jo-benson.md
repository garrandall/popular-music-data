Love
Is quite a feeling
(Tell them one more time)
Love
Is so appealing

Oh now come this Friday night
Everything will be uptight
I got plans baby
That are out of sight

Maybe we can slip away
And take a lovers' holiday
We'll try not to overstay
But if we do it's okay
Baby

Maybe we can slip away
We can love 'til the break of day
We don't care what the people say
We just go our own way
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Love (oh love)
Is reassuring
I'm talking 'bout love (oh sweet love)
Is so enduring (I know it is) (Listen to me)
This you can't deny (and I won't babe)
And we won't even try (Oh no)
It's agreed baby
Love's for you and I

Maybe we can slip away
And take a lovers' holiday
We'll try not to overstay
But if we do it's okay
Babe

Maybe we can slip away
We can love 'til the break of day
We don't care what the people say
We just go our own way
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Maybe we can slip away
And take a lovers' holiday
We'll try not to overstay
But if we do it's okay (it's okay it's okay)

Maybe we can slip away
