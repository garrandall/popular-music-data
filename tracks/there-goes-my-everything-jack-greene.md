There goes my only possesion there goes my everything
I hear footsteps slowly walking as they gently walk across a lonely floor
And a voice is softly saying darling this will be goodbye forever more
There goes my reason for living there goes the one of my dreams
There goes my only possesion there goes my everything

As my mem'ry turns back the pages I can see the happy years we had before
Now the love that kept this old heart beating
Has been shattered by the closing of a door
There goes my reason for living...
