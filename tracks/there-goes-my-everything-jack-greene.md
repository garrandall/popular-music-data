There goes my only possession
There goes my everything

I hear footsteps slowly walking
As they gently walk across the lonely floor
And a voice that's softly saying
Darling, this will be goodbye forever more

There goes my reason for living
There goes the one of my dreams
There goes my only possession
There goes my everything

As my memory turns back the pages
I can see the happy years we had before
And the love that kept this old heart beating
Has been shattered by the closing of the door

Oh, there goes my reason for living
There goes the one of my dreams
There goes my only possession
There goes my everything
Yes, there goes my everything
