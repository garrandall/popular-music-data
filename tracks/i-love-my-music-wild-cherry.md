Doo do do

Well when you listen to the music
Does it make you want to sing?
Or does it make you want to dance to the heavy beated brains?
Deep down in my soul
Deep down in my bones
Sometimes I get the feeling you're so deep I can't let go
But I, I guess I'm gonna be love you more
Start making em', heart breaking, I kill the ladies with my song
Riding high I'm kinda crazy
Maybe fool is what it seems
The only thing that gets me high is when I'm playing in the scene

Cos' dancing and singing and getting it on and singing songs
That's my thrill, that's my thrill (alright)
It's fascination, sensation, sophisticated, complicated funky lady (communication)
I love my music, sweet music (oh oh oh oh)
It's the only thing that makes me feel alright
I love my music, sweet music (oh oh oh oh)
It's the only love that ever treats me right

I love my music, sweet music (oh oh oh oh)
It's the only thing that makes me feel alright
I love my music, sweet music (oh oh oh oh)
It's the only love that ever treats me right

Now that you got the beat girl, does it make you jump and shout?
Do you feel kinda crazy, wondering what it's all about?
Will you ever understand this?
Do you know just what I mean?
And now please don't shrug your shoulders
Because there ain't no in between

Oh I
Excuse me if I'm ever low
I'm just making sure you know what's going on
Cos' if you, if you really want me
You've gotta realise
No one comes before my music
And I will be no compromise

Cos' dancing and singing and getting it on and singing songs
That's my thrill, that's my thrill (alright)
It's fascination, sensation, sophisticated, complicated funky lady (communication)

I love my music, sweet music
(oh oh oh oh)
It's the only thing that makes me feel alright
I love my music, sweet music
(oh oh oh oh)
It's the only love that ever treats me right
I love my music, sweet music
(oh oh oh oh)
It's the only thing that makes me feel alright
I love my music, sweet music
(oh oh oh oh)
It's the only love that ever treats me right

Oh yeah
Oh my music yeah
Well yeah
Man my music yeah, yeah
Makes me feel alright yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And my music
And my music
And my music yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
