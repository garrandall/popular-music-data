(Yeah yeah)
(Yeah Billy, yo Billy)
(Way to go Billy)

Oh feelin', can't stop this feelin', oh no
The perfect lover
Oh, that's what you are, baby
I'm in Heaven
You take me to Heaven, oh
Fly like an Angel
Be my lucky star, baby, ooh

(I want to get up and on and on)
Transmission's on and up we go, oh
(I want to get up and drive you higher)
Imagination high, my resistance low, yo

And all you gotta do is say
(Yeah Billy, go Billy, way to go)
And don't you worry, it's alright
(It's all right)
Let me tell you
(Why Billy, now Billy, gimme all you got)
It's so exciting and so right
(So right)

Ohh oh, oh don't stop what you doin' to me
'Cause girl I'm hot and I'm ready to please
Just say
(Where Billy, when Billy, can we do it again Billy?)
(Yeah Billy, yo Billy)
And I'll be your license to chill

(License to chill)
Ooh, what a feelin'
(Rock the love, rock the love)
I'm rockin' and reelin'
(Rock the Heaven)
Seeing is believin'
Oh, and you got the key
(Got you, baby)

(I want to get up and on and on)
Transmission's on and up we go
(I want to get up and drive you higher)
Imagination high, my resistance low, yo

And all you gotta do is say
(Yeah Billy, yo Billy, way to go)
Don't you worry, it's alright
(It's alright)
Let me tell you
(Why Billy, now Billy, gimme all you got)
It's so exciting and so right
(So right)

Don't stop what you doin' to me
'Cause I, I'm hot and I'm ready to please
Just say
(Where Billy, when Billy, can we do it again Billy?)
(Yeah Billy, yo Billy)
And I'll be your license to chill

(You've got the fire, baby, I've got to have it)
(You've got the love, baby, I've got to have it)

(I want to get up and on and on)
Transmission's on and up we go

(Yeah Billy, yo Billy, way to go)
Say yeah, say yeah

All you gotta do is say
(Yeah Billy, yo Billy, way to go)
Don't you worry, it's alright
(It's alright)
Let me tell you

Ohh oh, oh, don't stop what you doin' to me
'Cause I, I'm gonna give you love like it ought to be
Just say where, just say where
