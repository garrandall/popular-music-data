When I'm away from you
I know what to say and do
But every time you're near
My courage disappears, ah ha

The words are on my lips
When my composure slips
While you're collected and cool
I make a fool of myself

I want so much to be
The only love you see
I fall each time I try
To look good in your eyes, ah ha

Don't know if I'll get through
Being destroyed by you
While you're collected and cool
I make a fool of myself

Hey, little girl
How could you care
Little girl, you're unaware
Of the love I have to share
Inside me dying, oh, I'm crying

Lord above please let me see
She's the life and breath of me
How my heart is breakin' when I'm sleepin', wakin'
I keep making a fool of myself

I want so much to be
The only love you see
I fall each time I try
To look good in your eyes, ah ha

Don't know if I'll get through
Being destroyed by you
While you're collected and cool
I make a fool of myself

Oh, little girl
How could you care
Little girl, you're unaware
Of the love I have to share
Inside me dying, oh, I'm crying
