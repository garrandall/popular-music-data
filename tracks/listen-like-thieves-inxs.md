On the talk back show
On the radio
At the local bar
In the hot traffic
By the red tail lights

Everybody's down on their knees
Listen like thieves
But who needs that
When it's all in your hands

And we take it down
To the end of town
Where they have control
But they're loosing touch
When the lights go out

You are all you need
You are all you need
So don't hesitate
There's no time to waste
You just do it for yourself
