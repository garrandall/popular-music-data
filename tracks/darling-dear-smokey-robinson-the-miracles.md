Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba, bo bo bo
Ba ba ba ba ba ba

The game of love is such a beautiful game
If you got time, lil' girl I’d love to explain
All the dos and don'ts
All the wills and won'ts

So bend an ear
Sweet darlin’ dear
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba (ba ba ba ba ba oh

First, I'll place my arms
So firmly around you
(Oh) and whisper
"Darlin', I'm so glad
I found you"

(Oh) and then your lips of wine
I softly touch with mine
And a kiss we'll steal
Sweet darlin' dear
(Sweet darlin' dear)

Ba ba ba ba ba ba
Do be sincere
And true love will appear
Don't be shy
Or true love might pass you by

If you will
This old heart you can steal
If you don’t
The game of love
You’ll lose alone

Yeah, Yeah
Ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Sweet darlin' dear
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

Do be sincere
And true love will appear
Don’t be shy
Or true love might pass you by

If you will
This old heart you can steal
And if you don't
The game of love
You'll lose alone

(Ba ba ba) the game of love is
Such a wonderful game (ba ba ba ba ba ba)
(Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba) if you got time, little girl
(Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba) I'd love to explain
All the dos and don’ts
All the wills and won'ts

So bend an ear
Sweet darlin' dear
(Sweet darlin' dear)

Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Darlin' dear
(Sweet darlin' dear) (ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)
So bend an ear
Sweet darlin' dear
(Sweet darlin' dear) (ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)
So bend an ear
Sweet darlin' dear
