I hear a heart beat
It's ringing out across the universe
It sounds so lost and lonely
It must come from somewhere deep inside of us
And the operator says:


"All is calm and all is quiet
Close your eyes and sleep tonight"


This is the world calling (All is calm and all is quiet)
This is Earth (Close your eyes and sleep tonight)
This is the world calling (All is calm and all is quiet)
This is us (Close your eyes and sleep tonight)


I'm on a train now
I'm moving through the yellow fields of rape
There's so much beauty
I wished that I believed enough to pray
Then the operator replied:


"Spinning 'round, you're wrapped in blue
There's no one looks as good as you"


This is the world calling (Spinning 'round, you're wrapped in blue)
This is us (There's no one looks as good as you)
This is the world calling (Spinning 'round, you're wrapped in blue)
This is us (There's no one looks as good as you)
This is the world calling (Spinning 'round, you're wrapped in blue)
This is us (There's no one looks as good as you)
And it goes on, and on


What we gonna to do, because it cannot go on?
What we gonna to do, because it cannot go on?
So, wrap me in your arms and baby keep me warm tonight
What we gonna to do, because it cannot go on?
What we gonna to do, because it cannot go on?
So, wrap me in your arms and baby keep me warm tonight


This is the world calling
This is us
This is the world calling
This is us
This is the world calling
This is us
This is the world calling
God help us
And it goes on, and on, and on


(Where all is calm and all is quiet)
(Close your eyes, sleep tonight)
This is the world calling (All is calm and all is quiet)
(Close your eyes, sleep tonight)
This is the world calling (All is calm and all is quiet)
(You look beautiful tonight)
This is the world calling (Spinning 'round and that is you)
(There's no one else as good as you)
This is the world calling
All is calm and all is quiet
Close your eyes, sleep tonight
This is the world calling...
