(My willpower is going fast)
Oh, baby, what you do to me
(My willpower just doesn't
Look like it can last)

Let me tell you, nice girls
Don't kiss on their first date
I know I ought to make you wait
Oh, what you do (to my willpower)

(It's been an hour since
We reached my door)
I really ought to say goodnight
(It's been an hour since you said
Won't you give me five minutes more)

Can't you see that I
Hardly even know you yet
Should be playing hard to get
Baby, what you do (to my willpower)

(My mama told me
Not to let you hold me)
Til I got to know you well
(She said think of your reputation)
Some boys like to kiss and tell

(My willpower just ain't that strong)
Oh, baby, what you do to me
(My willpower doesn't look
Like it can last too long)

Don't you know that I know
I should put up a fight before
I let you hold me tight but
Oh, what you do (to my willpower)

Don't you know that I know
I should put up a fight before
I let you hold me tight but
Oh, what you do (to my willpower)

(I really ought to say goodnight)
To my willpower
(Oh, baby, what you do to me)
My willpower

(I guess I'm just a hopeless case)
I can't take it anymore
(I really ought to say goodnight)
