Oooooo
Go on and do it
Do it, do it 'til you're satisfied
(Whatever it is)
Do it, do it 'til you're satisfied
Go on and do it
Do it, do it 'til you're satisfied

Do it, do it 'til you're satisfied
People know just what they'd like to do
Whatever it is you got it as long it pleases you
Make it last as long as you can
When your through it's up to you to try it again
Go on and do it
Do it, do it 'til you're satisfied
(Whatever it is)
Do it, do it 'til you're satisfied
Go on and do it
Do it, do it 'til you're satisfied
(Whatever it is)
Do it, do it 'til you're satisfied
Everybody knows what they'd like to do
Whatever it is, do it, as long as it pleases you
Just take some time and relax your mind
Then do it, do it, do it 'till you're satisfied
Go on and do it, now
Do it, do it 'til you're satisfied
(Whatever it is)
Do it, do it 'til you're satisfied
Go on and do it
Do it, do it 'til you're satisfied
(Whatever it is)
Do it now, do it 'til you're satisfied
Then you hawler oh, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh
I'm satisfied, I'm satisfied
Then you hawler oh, wooo-hooooo, hoooo-ooooo
Woooooo
Go on and do it
Do it,(do it slow) do it slow 'til you're satisfied
(Whatever it is)
Got to do it (Just do it some more)
Go on and do it
Do it, do it 'til you're satisfied
(Whatever it is)
Do it, do it 'til you're satisfied
Do it, do it 'til you're satisfied
(Whatever it is)
Got to do it
Do it, do it 'til you're satisfied
Go on and do it, girl
(Do it slow)
Got to do it
(Whatever it is)
Got to do it good
(Just do it some more)
Do it until you're satisfied
I'm satisfied

I'm satisfied
I'm satisfied
I'm satisfied
I'm satisfied
Go on and do it, ya
