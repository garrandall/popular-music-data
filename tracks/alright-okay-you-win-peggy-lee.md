Well alright, okay, you win.
I'm in love with you.
Well alright, okay, you win.
Baby, what can I do?
I'll do anything you say.
It's just got to be that way.

Well alright, okay, you win.
I'm in love with you.
Well alright, okay, you win.
Baby, what can I do?
Anything you say, I'll do.
As long as it's me and you.

All that I am asking,
All I want from you,
Just love me like I love you
And it won't be hard to do.

Well alright, okay, you win.
I'm in love with you.
Well alright, okay, you win.
Baby, what can I do?
I'll do anything you say.
It's just got to be that way.

All that I am asking,
All I want from you,
Just love me like I love you
And it won't be hard to do.

Well alright, okay, you win.
I'm in love with you.
Well alright, okay, you win.
Baby, one thing more:
If you're gonna be my man,
Sweet baby, take me by the hand.
