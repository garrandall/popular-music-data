God is great
Man is not
Man made whiskey
God made pot
God made women
We make war
But oh a good woman
That's worth fighting for
Oh, yea
And the way Im feelin'
Ain't never gonna change
Baby dont you know my heart is healing
Every time I see your face


La, da, da, da, da, da, dee
Oh, God made you and God made me
He made you a girl to pull me through
And he made this man for loving you
Hallelujah, so glad I bumped into ya
Hallelujah, so glad I bumped into ya

God made grandma
She made pie
Taste so good
Bring a tear to your eye
Make a grown man cry
God made music
God made love
And he made Smokey Robinson
So, let's put him on and make some, that's right
Yeah
Hallelujah


La, da, da, da, da, da, dee
Oh, God made you and God made me
He made you a girl to pull me through
And he made this man for loving you
Hallelujah, so glad I bumped into ya
Hallelujah, so glad I bumped into ya

I don't want no tie
I want no suit
Just want you in your birthday suit
Don't want no cars
Want no trucks
Just want you
And I want your love, oh, yeah, baby
Just want you
And I want your love

Oh, la, da, da, da, da, da, dee
Oh, God made you and God made me
He made you a girl to pull me through
And he made this man
Oh, la, da, da, da, da, da, dee
Oh, God made you and god made me
He made you a girl to pull me through
And he made this man
Yeah, he made this man
And he made this man for loving you
Hallelujah
So glad bumped into ya
