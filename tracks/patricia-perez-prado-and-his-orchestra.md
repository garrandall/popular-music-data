Kiss her and your lips will always want Patricia
Stroll her, see Patricia move with all her charms
Mambo, Cha-cha, or Meringue it's Patricia
Heaven, that's where you'll be when she's in you're arms

??? in Japan they brag about the Geisha
Who cares, long Uncle Sam has got Patricia
Eyes that have a starry sort of gleam for you
She is like a million dollar dream come true
Everybody wishes they'd could steal her heart away, I guess
There's so many trying but she never, never will say yes
Eyes that have a starry sort of gleam for you
She is like a million dollar dream come true
Kiss her and your lips will always want Patricia
Stroll her, see Patricia move with all her charms
??? in Japan they brag about the Geisha
Who cares, long Uncle Sam has got Patricia
