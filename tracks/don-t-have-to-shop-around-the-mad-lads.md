I found a love that my heart
Has been longing for
I don't have to shop around
(Shop around, shop around)
Anymore

And I found a love that my heart
Has been longing for
She'll never put me down
(Put me down, put me down)
Anymore

No more ladies man (lyin' for me)
No more playing the field (field)
I found my love in a (sweet little girl)
And I know (I know)
I know this love is real

I found a love that my heart
Has been longing for
I don't have to shop around
(Shop around, shop around)
Anymore

Don't have to shop around
