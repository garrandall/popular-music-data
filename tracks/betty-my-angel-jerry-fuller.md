When summer's here and winter fades by
And school is almost through
You can bet all the stars
That shine bright in the sky
That I'll still be in love with you

Betty, my angel
Won't you please be mine
Say that you'll love me
'Til the end of time

Angel, my angel
Won't you set my heart at ease
I want you, I need you, I love you

You said we'd go steady
But that was in the fall
Now darling, Betty
You make me feel so small
Baby, my baby
Won't you give your love to me

The call on the phone
When they said
She's not home
Oh, they left me
So sad and blue
I'll swallow my pride
Though it hurts me deep inside
And I still keep
Comin' back for you

Betty, my angel
Please wear my highschool sweater
Angel, my angel
No one could be better

Baby, my baby
Won't you give your love to me
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
