Make my way through the motions
I try to ignore it
But home's looking farther
The closer I get
Don't know why
I can't see the end
Is it over yet?

A short leash
And a short fuse don't match
They tell me it ain't that bad
Now don't you overreact
So I just hold my breath
Don't know why
I can't see the sun
When young should be fun (fun)

And I guess the bad
Can get better
Gotta be wrong
Before it's right
Every happy phrase
Engraved in my mind
And I've always been a go-getter
There's truth
In every word I write
But still the growing pains, growing pains
They're keeping me up at night

Eh eh, hey yeah, yeah, yeah...
And I can't hide, 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night
Eh eh, hey yeah, yeah, yeah...
And I can't hide, 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night

Try to mend what's left of my content incomprehension
As I take on the stress of the mess that I've made
Don't know if I even care for "grown"
If it's just alone, yeah

And I guess the bad
Can get better
Gotta be wrong
Before it's right
Every happy phrase
Engraved in my mind
And I've always been a go-getter
There's truth
In every word I write
But still the growing pains, growing pains
They're keeping me up at night

Eh eh, hey yeah, yeah, yeah...
And I can't hide, 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night
Eh eh, hey yeah, yeah, yeah...
And I can't hide, 'cause growing pains are keeping me up at night

Starting to look like Ms. Know-it-all
Can't take her own advice
Can't find pieces of my peace of mind, I cry
More than I want to admit but I can't lie to myself, to anyone
'Cause phoning it in isn't any fun
Can't run back to my youth the way I want to
The days my brother was quicker to fool
AM radio, not much to do
Used monsters as an excuse
To lie awake
Now the monsters are the ones that I have to face
No band-aids for the growing pains

Eh eh, hey yeah, yeah, yeah...
No band-aids for the growing pains
