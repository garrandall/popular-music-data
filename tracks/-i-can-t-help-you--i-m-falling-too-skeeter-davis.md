You say that you're falling
But what can I do?
You want me to help you
But I'm falling too

I know that we're wrong dear
But when I'm with you
I can't help you darlin'
'Cause I'm falling too

You belong to another
Whose arms have grown cold
But, you must keep the vows dear
Although they've grown old

You can never be free dear
Though our love is true
I can't help you darlin'
'Cause I'm falling too

We could never be happy
Living in sin
Our love's a temptation
But we just can't win

You ask me to help you
But what can I do?
I can't help you darlin'
'Cause I'm falling too
