A little bit of guitar; a little bit of truck.
A little bit of hound-dog and a little bit of luck.
A little bit of bacon, a little bit of beans;
A little bit of you lovin' up on me.
A little bit of how it's s'posed to be:
A little bit of life.

A little bit of back-seat, a little bit of moon.
A little bit of radio goin' boom, boom, boom.
A little bit of sugar, a little bit of spice,
A little bit of nasty, a little bit of nice.
A little bit of how it's s'posed to be:
A little bit of life.

I breath in, I breath out.
Yeah. sleepin' all night with the windows down.
Up in the mornin', stirrin' around.
Drink a pot of coffee and I head off to town.
Work, work, work, all day long,
Crank it up, back it up, bring it on home,
Supper on the table and I eat me a bite,
Then we snuggle on the porch by the pale moonlight,
A little bit of me and you doin' all right:
A little bit of life.

A little bit of tractor, a little bit of farm.
A little bit of cornfield, and a little bit of barn.
A little bit of c'mon, a little bit of play.
A little bit of "yee-haw" in the hay.
A Dixie cup of home-made wine:
A little bit of life.

I breath in, I breath out.
Yeah. sleepin' all night with the windows down.
Up in the mornin', stirrin' around.
Drink a pot of coffee and I head off to town.
Work, work, work, all day long,
Crank it up, back it up, bring it on home,
Supper on the table and I eat me a bite,
Then we snuggle on the porch by the pale moonlight,
A little bit of me and you doin' all right:
A little bit of life.

A little bit of back-porch, a little bit of swing.
A little bit of wind-chimes a-going ding-a-ling.
A little bit of TV, a little bit of couch;
Popcorn smellin' up the house.
A-la-mode on a little slice of home-made pie.
A little bit of life.

I breath in, I breath out.
Yeah. sleepin' all night with the windows down.
Up in the mornin', stirrin' around.
Drink a pot of coffee and I head off to town.
Work, work, work, all day long,
Crank it up, back it up, bring it on home,
Supper on the table and I eat me a bite,
Then we snuggle on the porch by the pale moonlight,
A little bit of me and you doin' all right:
A little bit of life.

A little bit of me and you doin' all right:
A little bit of life.
Yeah, a little bit of life.

A little bit of guitar; a little bit of truck.
A little bit of hound-dog, a little bit of luck.
A little bit of back-seat, a little bit of moon.
A little bit of radio: boom, boom, boom.
A little bit of bacon, a little bit of beans;
A little bit of you lovin' up on me.
A little bit of c'mon, a little bit of play.
A little bit of yee-haw in the hay!
