I realize the way your eyes deceived me
With tender looks that I mistook for love
So take away the flowers that you gave me
And send the kind that you remind me of
Paper roses
Paper roses

Oh how real those roses seem to be
But they're only imitation
Like your imitation love for me

I thought that you would be a perfect lover
You seemed so full of sweetness at the start
But like a big red rose that's made of paper
There isn't any sweetness in your heart

Paper roses
Paper roses
Oh how real those roses seem to be
But they're only imitation
Like your imitation love for me
Like your imitation love for me
