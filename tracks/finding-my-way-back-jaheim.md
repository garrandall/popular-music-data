Lights out, 
sucker punch, siked out. 
Caught a love wave, 
Rode it then I wiped out. 
Two ships just passing in the night now, 
Offshore, looking for a light house. 
Reveal you said that it was painless, 
Down and out drowning in a sea of my anguish 
Funny, you always said hope floats. 
Comprehended but I cant cope 
So I 

Gotta find my way back, way back to you baby. 
Tryna find my way back , way back to you baby. 
Gotta find my way back, way back to you, to us, to love. 

Man down, my heart's in your hand now. 
Hate to love, draw an X in the sand now. 
No clue, no map, damn. 
so I'm digging until I end up in japan now. 

Reveal you said that it was painless, 
Down and out drowning in a sea of my anguish 
Funny, you always said hope floats. 
Comprehended but I cant cope 
So I 

Gotta find my way back, way back to you baby. 
Tryna find my way back , way back to you baby. 
Gotta find my way back, way back, to you, to us, to love. 

We go lost lines got crossed 
and the light turned to static baby. 
And your ship got caught up the current 
and carried both of us away 
We were so much better 
When we were together 
and just cant let you slip away. 

Gotta find my way back, way back to you baby. 
Tryna find my way back , way back to you baby. 
Gotta find my way back, way back, to you, to us, to love.
