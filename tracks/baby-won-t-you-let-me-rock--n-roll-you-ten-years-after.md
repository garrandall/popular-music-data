Baby won't you let me rock'n roll you
Baby won't you let me, let me stroll you
Baby won't you let me rock'n roll you now

Baby won't you let me, let me shake you
Baby won't you let me, let me breke you
Baby won't you let me really take you now

Well, you remember baby, how it used to be
I used to rock'n roll you around my knee
Well, I tell you, honey, gonna be alright
Gonna rock'n roll you all through the night

Baby won't you let me, let me shake you
Baby won't you let me, let me breke you
Baby won't you let me really take you now

I tell you baby, gonna be alright
I'm gonna rock you all through the night
Well, you remember how it used to be
I used to rock'n roll you around my knee

Baby won't you let me sock it to you
Baby won't you let me sock it to you
Baby won't you let me rock'n roll you now
