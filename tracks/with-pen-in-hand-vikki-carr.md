With pen in hand you sign your name
Today I find I'll be on that train
And you'll be free and I will be alone
So alone
If you think we can't find
The love we once knew
If you think I can't make
Everything up to you
Then I'll be gone
And you'll be on your own
You'll be on your own

Can you take good care of Jenny
Can you take her to school everyday
Can you teach her how to play
All the games that little girls play
Here what I say

Can you teach her how to roll up her hair
Can you make sure each night
That she says her prayers
Well if you can do these things
Then maybe she won't miss me
Maybe she won't miss me

And tonight as you lay
In that big lonely bed
And you look at that pillow
Where I laid my head
With your heart on fire
Will you have no desire
To kiss me
Or to hold me
And if you can forget
The good times that we had
If you don't think the good times
Outweigh the bad
Than go ahead and sign your name
And I'll be on my way
I'll be on my way
La da da da da da da da da
La da da da da da da da da
FADE
