Jimmie Rodgers Roulette R-4218
(Lehman-Lebowsky-Clarke) Kahl Music BMI

Tender love and care
Makes a life worth living
Tender love and care
That's what I'll be giving

Every day, every night with you
When you're wrong, when you're right, when you're blue
I'll give tender love and care to you
I'll give tender love and care (tender love and care)

Tender love and care (tender love and care)
I will give you always (I will give you always)
Tender love and care (tender love and care)
Both in big and small ways (both in big and small ways)

When you need me you'll find me there
At your side anytime anywhere
Giving tender love and care to you
Giving tender love and care (tender love and care)

Gentle sweet and kind (gentle sweet and kind)
I will always treat you (I will always treat you)
Gentle sweet and kind (gentle sweet and kind)
Every time I need you (every time I need you)

I will cheer you if you are low
I will chase all your cares and woe
Giving tender love and care to you (tender love and care)
Giving tender love and care (oooooh-ooooooh)
Tender love and care (oooooh-ooooooh)
Tender love and care (oooooh-ooooooh)
Tender love and care (oooooh-ooooooh)
Tender love and care (oooooh-ooooooh)
