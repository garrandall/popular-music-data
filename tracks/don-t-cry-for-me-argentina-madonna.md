It won't be easy
You think it's strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love
After all that I've done

You won't believe me
All you will see
Is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up

To the nines

At sixes
And sevens with you

I had to let it happen
I had to change

Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out

Of the window
Staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom

Running around
Trying everything new
But nothing
Impressed me
At all
I never
Expected it to

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is
I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

And as for fortune
And as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed

To the world
They were all I desire
They are illusions
They're not
The solutions they promise to be

The answer
Was here
All the time
I love you
And hope you love me
Don't cry for me
Argentina

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is
I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

Have I said too much?
There's nothing more
I can think of
To say to you

But, all you have to do
Is look at me to know
That every word
Is true!
