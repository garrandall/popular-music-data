Maria

She was fine
The girl was from the projects
She had long brown hair
And a body beyond compare
She had a boyfriend, a drug dealer
But I didn't mind 'cause she wanted to be with me
So we have to set her free

And when I hear her name
I swear, I hear the wind blow
It drives me insane
I'll never let her go (never let her go)
And I start to laugh 'cause I'm so afraid of crying
And I'm dying to see her once more

Maria
The most beautiful sound I ever heard
Maria
Don't tell your boyfriend how I feel about you
'Cause I need you
And I gotta make you mine
I've got to make you mine

Wouldn't it be cool
If we got together?
I'll show you that I love you
Then you'd understand
If he's a drug dealer
Don't you know that he won't last forever?
And you need the affections of a normal man

And when I see your name
I swear, I hear the wind blow
It drives me insane
I'll never let you go (never let you go)
And I start to laugh 'cause I'm so afraid of crying
And I'm dying to see you once more

Maria
The most beautiful sound I ever heard
Maria
Don't tell your boyfriend how I feel about you
'Cause I need you
And I gotta make you mine
I've got to make you mine

Maria
The most beautiful sound I ever heard
Maria
Don't tell your boyfriend how I feel about you
'Cause I need you
And I gotta make you mine
I've got to make you mine

Maria
The most beautiful sound I ever heard
Maria
Don't tell your boyfriend how I feel about you
'Cause I need you
And I gotta make you mine
I've got to make you mine

Whenever she's around
My whole world starts coming down
And I lose control
When she's away I began to miss her
She holds me close and I can't resist her
She kisses me on the lips
Walks away and wiggles her hips
And I lose control
Gotta have that girl, she's all I ever wanted

Don't tell your man
I got a plan
So understand that I can never be the type of guy
That will try to make you cry _______?
_______? were never true to take the blame
So I will make your mine, don't look behind
In time the thing will fit the crime
Like they say, what comes around goes around
And brings you down

Maria, yeah some place for us
Maria, somewhere a place for us
Together we will be, until eternity
Somewhere out there, I've got to make you mine
Tonight in the corners of my lonely room
I pray for your salvation, rehabilitation
And I pray to the lord above to forever bring me love
And as I fall asleep to dream once more
I have to make you mine

Maria
The most beautiful sound I ever heard
Maria
Don't tell your boyfriend how I feel about you
'Cause I need you
And I gotta make you mine
I've got to make you mine
