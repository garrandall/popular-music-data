Back to being free again
Back to being me again
With all my precious freedom, my precious, precious freedom
On my own
Back to being on my own
Back to live the life I'd known
Before I ever knew him, before I ever knew him
Free again, independent me , free again
Time to call up all the crowd
Raise the roof and shout out loud
Time to have a party, a party
Lucky me, take a look at lucky, lucky me
Take a look and you can see
How much I love my freedom, my precious, precious freedom
Simple me, complicated, simple me
Back to where I used to be before I ever knew him
Before I ever knew him
Free again, lucky, lucky me
Free again
Back in circulation, now,
Time for celebration, now
Time to have a party, a party...
Free again, independent me free again
Time to call up all the crowd
Raise the roof and shout out loud
Time to have a party!
Lucky me, take a look at lucky, lucky me
Back to where I used to be! Back to where I used to be!
Free again... Free again...
Free...
