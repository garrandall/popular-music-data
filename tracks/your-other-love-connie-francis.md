Your other love
Says she will be
Yours faithfully
But she'll deceive you
She'll leave you
And break your hea-art

I offer you
Love that is true
Darling, you'll find
This love of mine
Is deeper and stronger than your other love

She wants to play
Just for today
I will be yours
Forever more
I'll love you so much more than your other love

Your other love
Your other love
Your other love

Fade
Your other love
