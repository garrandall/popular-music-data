No matter what sign you are
The supremes
Capricorn, scorpio, taurus, gemini, virgo
Cancer, pieces, leo, libra, aries,
Aquarius, sagitarius
The moon shines bright above
And the charts declare it's not my night for love
Ah the beat of my heart
I feel a good vibration
Saying you and me baby
Would make a good combination
There's no need for looking to the stars
Can't you see the stars shine in my eyes
I love you boy, i really love you boy
No matter what sign you are
You're gonna be mine you are
Can't let astrology chart our destiny
No matter what sign you are
You're gonna be mine you are
The beat of the heart my love
Is stronger than the charts my love
Your water sign just lit my fire
You fill me with such desire
I love you boy, i really love you boy
No matter what sign you are
You're gonna be mine you are
Can't let astrology chart our destiny
Oh no matter what sign you are
You're gonna be mine you are
Need you beside me love
Only you guide me love
Capricorn, scorpio, taurus, gemini, virgo
Cancer, pieces, leo, libra, aries,
Aquarius, sagitarius
I don't care about your rising sign
All i know is when your lips touch mine
You move me boy, you really move me boy
No matter what sign you are
You're gonna be mine you are
Hold me tight, ah hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
