I've been racking my brain
Cause I feel I've been going insane
Something bout you changed
No matter how hard I try
It's getting hard to deny
I'm not really sure
But you're nothing like you were before
My mama told me back then
So did my friends but I never listened

Shame on me because my eyes were closed 
And you gon have to live the life that you choose
But, that's alright I suppose, I burned all your clothes (lighter)
Yes I did...

You're playing with fire
Hot just like an oven
You played with my lovin'
It's gon' cost you something
Cause your playing with fire
Hot just like an oven
You played with my lovin'
It's gon' cost you something
Cause your playing with fire
You'll never learn
Now it's your turn to burn, burn, burn, burn

I may not have proof
But you and I both know its the truth
I don't wanna hear no excuse
I'm turning you loose before this shit hit the roof
Hey Mr. Insincere,
You ain't fooling me with dem tears
And I haven't felt the way that a woman oughta feel in years

Shame on me because my eyes were closed
And you gon' have to live the life that you chose
That's alright I suppose, I burned all your clothes
I did... Yes I did...

Cause you're playing with fire
Hot just like an oven
You played with my lovin'
It's gon' cost you something
Cause you're playing with fire
Hot just like an oven
You played with my lovin'
It's gon' cost you something
You keep on playing with fire
(You'll ne-) Cause you'll never learn
Now it's your turn to burn, burn, burn, burn

Ladies don't forget who you are
Don't you ever stop believing just keep raising the bar
And no matter who can see it, keep your goods in the jar
Hey!
Cause you're perfect
And you're worth it
Get your groove back

Cause you're playing with fire
Hot just like an oven
You played with my lovin'
It's gon' cost you something
You keep on playing with fire
Hot just like an oven
You played with my lovin'
It's gon' cost you something
You keep on playing with fire
(You'll ne-) You'll never learn
Now its your turn to burn, burn, burn, burn

I said you're playing with
I said you're playing with
I said you're playing baby, playing baby, playing games, playing playing baby
I said you're playing
Said you didn't know
Who you were dealing with
You didn't know
