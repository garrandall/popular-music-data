Well there's a bridge and there's a river that I still must cross 
As I'm going on my journey 
Oh, I might be lost 

And there's a road I have to follow, a place I have to go 
Well no-one told me just how to get there 
But when I get there I'll know 
Cuz I'm taking it 


Step By Step, Bit by Bit, 
Stone By Stone (Yeah), Brick by Brick (Oh, yeah) 
Step By Step, Day By Day, Mile by mile (ooh, ooh, ooh) 

And this old road is rough and ruined 
So many dangers along the way 
So many burdens might fall upon me 
So many troubles that I have to face 

Oh, but I won't let my spirit fail me 
Oh, I won't let my spirit go 
Until I get to my destination 
I'm gonna take it slowly cuz I'm making it mine 


Step By Step (you know I'm taking it), bit by bit (bit by bit, come move), 
stone by stone (yeah), brick by brick (brick by brick by brick by brick mmm...) 
Step by step (step by step uh-huh), day by day (day by day-ee), 
mile by mile (ooh), go your own way. 

Say it, baby, don't give up 
You got to hold on to what you got, 
Oh, baby, don't give up, 
You got to keep on moving on don't stop (yeah yeah). 
I know you're hurting, and i know you're blue, 
i know you're hurting but don't let the bad things get to you. 


I'm taking it step by step (ohohoh), bit by bit (bit by bit come move), 
stone by stone (stone by stone yeah), brick by brick (brick by brick by brick by brick), 
Step by step (i'm gonna take it now),day by day (day by day-ee), 
mile by mile (ooh), go your own way! 

(c'mon baby got to keep moving), 
(i'm taking it step by step), bit by bit, 
stone by stone (yeah, stone by stone), brick by brick 
c'mon baby, 
step by step keep on moving, day by day (day by day-ee), 
mile by mile by mile by mile,go your own way, 
c'mon baby got to keep moving, bit by bit (bit by bit, bit by bit)....
