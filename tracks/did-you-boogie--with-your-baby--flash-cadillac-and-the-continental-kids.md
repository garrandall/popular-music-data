(Wolfman)
Ah, do you remember the first time you started to date
And the places you had to go just to be alone with your number one?
Well, I hope this song brings back a whole lot of beautiful memories
For you

(Flash)
Did you boogie with your baby in the back row of the movie show
And did you boogie there cause you had nowhere else that you could go
And when the lights went way down low
Did you forget about the picture show
Yes, did you boogie with your baby in the back row of the movie show

Hey, little girl was it so long ago
We'd take a walk just to be alone
And hey little girl if it should rain or snow
Remember where we would go

Did you boogie with your baby in the back row of the movie show
And did you boogie there cause you had nowhere else that you could go
And when the lights went way down low
Did you forget about the picture show
Yes, did you boogie with your baby in the back row of the movie show

(Wolfman)
Sometimes I get to thinkin' there's not enough love and
Romance left in our lives today. And that's why I'd like to
Reminisce and to relive that first feeling of love and do it all over
Again

(Flash)
Hey little girl why not come over here
And set beside me and make believe
And say, little girl, why not stay over here
We'll have a party for two

Did you boogie with your baby in the back row of the movie show
And did you boogie there cause you had nowhere else that you could go
And when the lights went way down low
Did you forget about the picture show
Yes, did you boogie with your baby in the back row of the movie show
