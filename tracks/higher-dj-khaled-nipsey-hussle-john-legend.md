We The Best Music

Mmm, yeah, oh
DJ Khaled

You keep takin' me higher and higher, yeah
But don't you know that the Devil is a liar
I know, they'd rather see me down
Put my soul in the fire
But we keep going higher, higher

Uh, look
My granny eighty-eight, she had my uncle and then
A miscarriage back to back every year for like ten
Pregnant with my moms, doctor told her it was slim
Was bed-rode for 9 months but gave birth in the end
Pops turned 60, he proud what we done
In one generation, he came from Africa young
Said he met my moms at the Century Club
Los Angeles love, kinda like Hussle and Boog
Emani turned 10, Kross turned 2
Startin' to see this life shit from a bird's view
We the ones that made millions off the curb fool
In this rap shit ten, never made nerd moves (Yeah)

Hey (Whoa)
You keep takin' me higher and higher (Hussle)
yeah (Khaled) 
But don't you know that the Devil is a liar (Ay)
I know (Right back) they'd rather see me down
Put my soul in the fire
But we keep going higher, higher (Whoa, whoa)
(Nip talk to 'em)

Emptied out the clip, it was broad day
Fuck niggas always gotta learn the hard way?
We gon' tape it off if we ball play
Put a half a moon crescent on your bald fade
Police hit the lights, that's a car chase
Lookin' back at my life make my heart race
Dance with the devil and test our faith
I was thinkin' chess moves, but it was God grace
(The Devil is a liar)
Crooked ass whoever, 'til we all straight
With no shame, I peeped game and it's all fake
South Central state of mind, high crime rate
Homicide, hate, gang banging'll get you all day
(Yeah) And look at my fate

You keep takin' me higher and higher, yeah
(I told Khaled bounce the four 'til the bar break)
But don't you know that the Devil is a liar
I know, they'd rather see me down
Put my soul in the fire
But we keep going higher, higher

Higher. Oh, Lord
Can you feel it?
My shoes is scrapin' the sky
I'm so high
We keep goin' higher
