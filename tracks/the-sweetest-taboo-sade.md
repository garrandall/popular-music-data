If I tell you
If I tell you now
Will you keep on
Will you keep on loving me
If I tell you
If I tell you how I feel
Will you keep bringing out the best in me 
You give me, you give me the sweetest taboo
You give me, you're giving me the sweetest taboo
Too good for me 

There's a quiet storm
And it never felt like this before
There's a quiet storm
That is you
There's a quiet storm
And it never felt this hot before
Giving me something that's taboo
(Sometimes I think you're just too good for me) 

You give me the sweetest taboo
That's why I'm in love with you
You give me the sweetest taboo
Sometimes I think you're just too good for me 

I'd do anything for you, I'd stand out in the rain
Anything you want me to do, don't let it slip away 

There's a quiet storm
And it never felt like this before
There'a a quiet storm
I think it's you
There'a a quiet storm
And I never felt this hot before
Giving me something that's taboo 

You give me the sweetest taboo
That's why I'm in love with you
You give me, you're giving me the sweetest taboo
Too good for me 

You've got the biggest heart
Sometimes I think you're just too good for me
Every day is Christmas, and every night is new years eve 

Will you keep on loving me
Will you keep on, will you keep on
Bringing out the best in me
