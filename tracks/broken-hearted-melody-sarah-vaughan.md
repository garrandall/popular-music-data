Br-oo-ken hearted me-ee-lo-dy
Ooooonce you were our song of love
Nooooow you just keep taunting me
With the memory of (ba-da-da)
His tender love. Oh
Broken hearted melody
Must you keep reminding me
Of the lips I long to kiss
And the love I miss since he went away
Night and day they play
That broken hearted melody
That he used to sing to me
When our love was young and bright
As he held me tight
Suddenly I found, I was heaven bound

Brooooken hearted melody
Ooooonce you were our song of love
Nooooow you just keep taunting me
With the memory of (ba-da-da)
His tender love, Oh
Broken hearted melody
Won't you bring him back to me
Sing to him until he yearns
For when he returns no more will he be
A broken hearted melody
Oooooooo, oo-oo
Oo-oo, oo-oo, oo
Oooooooo, oo-oo
Oo-oo, oo-oo, oo
