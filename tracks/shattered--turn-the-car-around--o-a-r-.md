In a way, I need a change 
From this burnout scene 
Another time, another town 
Another everything 
But it's always back to you 

Stumble out, in the night 
From the pouring rain 
Made the block, sat and thought 
There's more I need 
It's always back to you 

But I'm good without ya 
Yeah, I'm good without you 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 

How many times can I break till I shatter? 
Over the line can't define what I'm after 
I always turn the car around 
Give me a break let me make my own pattern 
All that it takes is some time but I'm shattered 
I always turn the car around 

I had no idea that the night 
Would take so damn long 
Took it out, on the street 
While the rain still falls 
Push me back to you 

But I'm good without ya 
Yeah, I'm good without you 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 

How many times can I break till I shatter? 
Over the line can't define what I'm after 
I always turn the car around 
Give me a break let me make my own pattern 
All that it takes is some time but I'm shattered 
I always turn the car around 

Give it up, give it up, baby 
Give it up, give it up, now 
Now 

How many times can I break till I shatter? 
Over the line can't define what I'm after 
I always turn the car around 
All that I feel is the realness I'm faking 
Taking my time but it's time that I'm wasting 
Always turn the car around 

How many times can I break till I shatter? 
Over the line can't define what I'm after 
I always turn the car around 

Don't wanna turn that car around 
I gotta turn this thing around
