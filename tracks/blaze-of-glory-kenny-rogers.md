Let's go out in a blaze of glory
All good things must end
Like two heroes in a story
Let's go out like we came in
In a blaze of glory

Here we are broken hearted
We thought our love would never end
We fell hard when we got started
We're fallin' out like we fell in

Let's go out in a blaze of glory
All good things must end
Like two heroes in a story
Let's go out like we came in
In a blaze of glory

Let's don't lie and hurt each other
That would be our worst mistake
Once again let's act like lovers
One more time for old time's sake

Let's go out in a blaze of glory
All good things must end
Like two heroes in a story
Let's go out like we came in
In a blaze of glory

Let's go out in a blaze of glory
All good things must end
Like two heroes in a story
Let's go out like we came in
In a blaze of glory
