The bluest skies you've ever seen are in Seattle
And the hills the greenest green in Seattle
Like a beautiful child, growing up free and wild
Full of hopes and full of fears, full of laughter, full of tears
Full of dreams to last the years in Seattle
In Seattle

When it's time to leave your home and your loved ones
It's the hardest thing a boy can ever do
And you pray that you will find someone warm and sweet and kind
But you're not sure what's waiting there for you

The bluest skies you've ever seen are in Seattle
And the hills the greenest green in Seattle
Like a beautiful child, growing up free and wild
Full of hopes and full of fears, full of laughter, full of tears
Full of dreams to last the years in Seattle
In Seattle

When you find your own true love, you will know it
By her smile, by the look in her eye
Scent of pine trees in the air, never knew a day so fair
It makes you feel so proud that you could cry

The bluest skies you've ever seen are in Seattle
And the hills the greenest green in Seattle
Like a beautiful child, growing up free and wild
Full of hopes and full of fears, full of laughter, full of tears
Full of dreams to last the years in Seattle
In Seattle
In Seattle
In Seattle
