I guess I'll always love you
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need


Open up your arms (Open up your arms)
And let me walk on in
Open up your heart (Open up your heart)
And let me live again
When you left, you left with me
A dream no longer reality
I live in the shadows of our past
With this love that was born to last


I guess I'll always love you
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need


The only time I'm happy (The only time I'm happy)
Is when you're on my mind
Every day I live
More of the love to you I give
I've been a thousand places
Seen your smile on a thousand faces
No matter what I try to do (No matter what I do)
I'm always dreaming of you


I guess I'll always love you
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need


Every girl that passes by
I see your sparkle in her eye
Right away I stop and stare
Close my eyes and see you there
Whenever I feel almost free
Old memories start taking hold of me
I love you now so much more
Than I ever did before


I guess I'll always love you
I guess I'll always love you
I guess I'll always love you
