You can't go boy
We've been over it a hundred times but this one's different
This time I'm not asking what you think
I'm telling you
We're staying together
Whether you like it or not

Here we go!


If you thought that I would get up and go
Oh baby got something you should know
I got one thing on my mind
That's staying together
Oh and I'll tell you boy, it just isn't right
I won't say goodbye without a fight
'Cause you and me are staying together


Don't you say goodbye to me boy
There's something you should know
Here's love before your eyes
If you go my heart would leave me
When you walk out that door
It's like I told you before
Let's stay together


Oh, if you thought that I would stand by your side
You know me boy, I never lied
Cause you and me are staying together
Oh it was so much more than love at first sight
Please say you'll stay, say you might
Then say we are staying together

Cause I don't know baby what you've done, don't know
(I only know baby, I only know)
You were always the only one
(Oh please don't go baby, oh please don't go)
Don't take my heart away from me
And leave me out in the cold baby
(Out in the cold baby)
Cause you're the only one, cause you're the only one
Who could ever hold me

Now here's love
Ooo Ooo

Here's love before your eyes
If you go my heart would leave me
When you walk out that door
So let's stay together

Don't you say it, don't you say it, don't you say it
Don't you say goodbye to me boy
(Here's love) It's right before your eyes
Don't even think about it!
If you go my heart would leave me
When you walk out that door
It's like I told you before
Let's stay together

Don't you say goodbye
No, don't you say goodbye
(Here's love) Here's love
It's right before your
It's right before your eyes
Yeah!
