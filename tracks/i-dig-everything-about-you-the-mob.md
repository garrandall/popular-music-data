Baby I need your sweet loving
Baby, oh baby
Baby I need your sweet, sweet loving
Baby, oh baby

Whenever I'm feeling down
And my mind is under the weather
Whenever I'm on the ground
I need someone to get me together

And I dig everything about you
And I'm gonna say I can't live without you
Hey baby you know I'm gonna stay

Baby I need your sweet loving
Baby, oh baby
Baby I need your sweet, sweet loving
Baby, oh baby

I know that I've hurt your feelings
I've lied, and I've even been untrue
Now that my conscience needs some healing
I've found out I'm hung on you

And I dig everything about you
And I'm gonna say I can't live without you
Hey baby you know I'm gonna stay

You know you walk so nice, and you talk so nice
And you're just too much for me
And that's why I gotta tell you that

I dig everything about you (I dig everything about you)
Baby, oh baby
The way you walk
The way you talk
The way you move
