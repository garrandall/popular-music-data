I put that on everything, I will be reppin the south til the day that I die
I put that on everything, for the Midwest Iâm ready to ride because Iâm from the Chi.

Smoking on dro taking shots of petrone, go hard in the paint and get in a zone
taking the championship in the end and if I donât win Iâll bust a shot at your dome.
Iâm sticking you up if your pockets is on. I put that on everything.

Iâm winning the championship if you give me the ball, letting my nuts hang.
If itâs a J, then fuck it Iâm shoot it all. You put up the records of those in the past, Iâm fucking them up,
