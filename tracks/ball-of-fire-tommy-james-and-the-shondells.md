Scarlet hovering my head
Pretty and red
Pretty and red
Flowers dying in their bed
Oh, yeah

Why is everyone crying?
Mmm, hmm
Look up children, look and see
Shining down on you and me, yeah

And the ball of fire in the sky, yeah
Keeps watching over you and I, way up high
And the ball of fire in the sky, come on
Keeps watching over you and I, way up high

And now the towers are falling
Tumbling down
Tumbling down
Oh, can't you hear the angels calling?
Oh, yeah

Listen
Mmm, hmm
Shining through eternity
As it was so it shall be, yeah

And the ball of fire in the sky, yeah
Keeps watching over you and I, way up high, yeah
And the ball of fire in the sky
Keeps watching over you and I, you and I, yes, it does

And the ball of fire in the sky, come on
It keeps watching over you and I, way up high, come on
And the ball of fire in the sky, yeah
Keeps watching over you and I, you and I, way up high

And the ball of fire in the sky, yeah
It keeps watching over you and I, way up high, ho
And the ball of fire in the sky, come on
It keeps watching over you and I, way up high
