Eli's comin'
Eli's comin' (Eli's a-comin')
Well, you better hide your heart
Your loving heart
Eli's a-comin', and the cards say
A broken heart

Eli's comin', hide your heart, girl
Eli's comin', hide your heart, girl
Girl, Eli's a-comin', you better hide
Girl, Eli's a-comin', you better hide
Girl, Eli's a-comin', you better hide
Girl, Eli's comin', hide your heart, girl (Hide it)
You better, better hide your heart
Eli's comin', better walk

Walk but you'll never get away
No, you'll never get away from the burnin' a-heartache
I walked to Apollo by the bay
Everywhere I go, though
Eli's a-comin' (She walked, but she never got away)
Eli's a-comin' (She walked, but she never got away)
Eli's a-comin', and he's comin' to get ya (She walked, but, she walked, but)
Get down on your knees (She walked, but she never got away)

Eli's comin' (Hide it, hide it, hide it)
Girl, Eli's a-comin', you better hide
Girl, Eli's a-comin', you better hide
Girl, Eli's a-comin', you better hide
Girl, Eli's comin', hide your heart, girl (Hide it)
You better, better hide your heart
Eli's comin', better walk

Walk but you'll never get away
No, you'll never get away from the burnin' a-heartache
I walked to Apollo by the bay
Everywhere I go, though
Eli's a-comin' (She walked, but she'll never get away)
Eli's a-comin' (She walked, but she'll never get away)
Eli's a-comin', and he's comin' to get ya (She walked, but, she walked, but)
Get down on your knees (She walked, but she'll never get away)
Get down on your knees

No-no, no-no
Lord, I said no-no, no-no, no-no

(Hide it) She can
(Hide it) Hide it
(Hide it) You better
(Hide it) Somebody
(Hide it) You got to
(Hide it) Oh, my
(Hide it) Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
