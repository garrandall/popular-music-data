CHORUS:
And if you feel the need
To make love to me in the night
And if you wanna make love till you see the morning light
It's the rhythm of my love- oh yeah
The rhythm of love
It's the rhythm of my love- oh yeah
The rhythm of love

(I've got the rhythm...)

There is so much we can do
For the love of me and you
And I will do anything
Yes anything for you
Hey- I know what you want
I know what you need
And I will do anything
To get your love
Come close to me- oh baby...

CHORUS...

(The rhythm.)
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah.)




I close my eyes and I think of you
Imaging things we're about to do
And I will go anywhere
Yes anywqhere with you
Hey- I know what you want
I know what you need
And I will do anything
To get your love
(Get your love...)
Come close to me- oh baby...

CHORUS...
