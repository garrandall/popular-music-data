I've got a feeling that it's gonna be alright
We don't know where we're goin' and I don't know where I'm at
I'm kinda thinkin' I don't like nobody else
You know whatever happens, I will be right by your side

You, me in the spotlight
Running around till the end of the night
Hot, hot keep it comin'
We can rock out till the early morning
You, me, going all night
We don't care who's wrong and who's right
Hot, hot, keep it comin'
We can rock out till the early morning

Everybody's dancin' dancin' crazy
And we never stop, never stop
Everybody's ragin', ragin' crazy
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
I like you and you like me
We get together and we're happy
Did you hear me say that?
Did you, did you, did you hear me say that?
Snap!
And I like the way that we kiss
You and me together like this
Did you hear me say that?
Did you, did you, did you hear me say that?
Snap!

Another night
And so just crank that music up
We don't know where we're goin'
And I don't know where I'm at
It doesn't matter cause we always know what's up
I know whatever happens
You will be right by my side

You, me in the spotlight
Running around till the end of the night
Hot, hot, keep it comin'
We can rock out till the early morning
You, me, going all night
We don't care who's wrong and who's right
Hot, hot, keep it comin'
We can rock out till the early morning

Everybody's dancin', dancin' crazy
And we never stop, never stop
Everybody's ragin', ragin' crazy
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
I like you and you like me
We get together and we're happy
Did you hear me say that?
Did you, did you, did you hear me say that?
Snap!
And I like the way that we kiss
You and me together like this
Did you hear me say that?
Did you, did you, did you hear me say that?
Snap!

Oh, oh, uh, oh,

Everybody's dancin', dancin' crazy
And we never stop, we never stop
Everybody's ragin', ragin' crazy
Put your hands up
Put your hands up

Everybody's dancin', dancin' crazy
And we never stop, we never stop
Everybody's ragin', ragin' crazy
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
I like you and you like me
We get together and we're happy
Did you hear me say that?
Did you, did you, did you hear me say that?
Snap!
And I like the way that we kiss
You and me together like this
Did you hear me say that?
Did you, did you, did you hear me say that?
Snap!
