Here I am and I'm back again
I'm gonna Mashed Potatoes
I'm gonna start by going to New York City with your number one
I'm going to Boston
OW, I'm going to Buffalo
Going straight down the road and gonna stop in Cleveland, Ohio
Gonna go to your next door neighbor
I'm gonna Mashed Potatoes in Detroit, too
I'm gonna swing right on down the freeway
Doing the Mashed Potatoes, gonna stop in Chicago
And St. Louis, Missouri
Going way on the other side and stop in Memphis, Tennessee
While I'm in the neighborhood I'm gonna stop in Nashville, too
My old good old place, where everybody's having a mighty good time
In Charlotte, North Carolina
I believe I'll Mashed Potatoes where the cowboys stay
Of course, you know I'm talking about Dallas, Texas
And I want you to know I got Houston, Texas on my mind, OW
Now any of any of these places I called, and I missed your town
I just want you to know I'm coming through
'Cause I'm Mashed Potato bound
Miami, Florida, Jacksonville, too
Columbia, South Carolina, too, OW
And Norfolk, Virginia, too
San Francisco
I'd Mashed Potatoes at the World's Fair in Seattle, Washington
Los Angeles, California
Going back over on the East Coast
I'm going to Richmond, Virginia
I'm gonna fool ya
Now I'm going to my old hometown
I'm going to Augusta, Georgia
Spelled A-U-G-U-S-T-A
