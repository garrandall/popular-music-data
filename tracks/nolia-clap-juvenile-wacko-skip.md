Câmon, Câmon
Juvenile, Wacko, Skip


Where dat Melph at?
Where da Yo at?
Where dat Thomas at?
Where VL at?
Yaâll Hear that Nolia Clap? Yaâll hear that Nolia
Clap?


Iâm in the Calio, You know Iâm headed front of town
By Kayotic and Lil real One, cuz itâs going down
You see the DBâs tell âem Wacko lookin for âem
I got some dro, I got some change, I got some pussy for âem
If they ask you where Iâm at Iâm in the Melph pickin up Chuck
In the chromed out Bubblegum Pickup Truck
Slide on Josephine, Holla at Lil Kia and Pluck
My nigga Troy told me to keep it real as fuck
We bought the House of Blues tonight after the DJ in the Nolia
On Washington & Frerret, across the street from Babosca
But first Iâm bout to snatch up all Saratoga
Head straight to Foot Action and snatch me two pair of Soljaâs
Take a left on Taladonna get a O of that doja
Tell âem right on my trail and hit the gars and lets roll up
Iâm bout to hit Julio and get the blazes from soda
I got Geezy waiting on VL we bout to bang up this Yola


Where dat Melph at?
Where da Yo at?
Where dat Thomas at?
Where VL at?
Yaâll Hear that Nolia Clap? Yaâll hear that Nolia Clap?
Where Hollygrove at?
Gert Town at?
P Town at?
Nigga Town at?
Yaâll Hear that Nolia Clap? Yaâll hear that Nolia Clap?


Iâm in Hollygrove searching for the Skip dogg (Whaaa!)
H2 Chromed out, nice whip dogg
Letâs hit Gert Town I heard they pop it off
Or hit P town, I heard they drop it off
My couson Leaf on the Vill told me to swing through, On St. lou
He got two hoes thatâll eat and drank too
We can bounce thru lil feet and we can Fuck with these hoes
They Take dick in they ass, they take dick in the throat
They take dick in they hair, they take dick in they nose
They take a dick, anywhere your dick can go
But look ainât nuttin like my bitch out the St. Bernard
A gangsta broad, get Wacko Gangsta hard
She said we might could run a train if I pursue my G
If not I got it poppin off on Music Street
Last week I had to do about two of them freaks
But them niggas be thru there trippin so bring two of them heats


Where that Appleville at?
The St. Bernard at?
Lil Feet at?
The 8th ward at?
Yaâll Hear that Nolia Clap? Yaâll hear that Nolia Clap?
Where the desired at?
Dat Florida at? In LA
Cross the canal at?
Yaâll Hear that Nolia Clap? Yaâll hear that Nolia Clap?


I see you learnin, see you peepin out that Nolia clap
I bet you nine times outta ten that whole Nolia strapped
Ok we fell off for a minute but that Nolia back
We got quarters, ounces, and halfs and birds of smack
Ever since Soulja got killed I keep a murda gat
Stand on the middle of my projects where the murdas at
And every nigga every bitch who ainât heard of Wack
I bang women, bang children, bang the murda cats
I bang blocks, bang cribs, bang the Bourbon Lac
I bang anything in sight without the murda tax
Iâm just the hit to represent where I was born and raised
And every nigga in my section love to roam with Kâs (AK-47's)
You got beef holla at me, get it on today
You not quickly uptown downtown Roulette
Knock off your face, taste, waist, take arms and legs
Drop off your neck, wrist, toes, hair, palms, and head



Where dat Melph at?
Where da Yo at?
Where dat Thomas at?
Where VL at?
Yaâll Hear that Nolia Clap? Yaâll hear that Nolia Clap?
Where Hollygrove at?
Gert Town at?
P Town at?
Nigga Town at?
Yaâll Hear that Nolia Clap? Yaâll hear that Nolia Clap?
Where that Appleville at?
The St. Bernard at?

The 8th ward at?
Yaâll Hear that Nolia Clap? Yaâll hear that Nolia Clap?
Where the desired at?
Dat Florida at? In LA
Cross the canal at?
Yaâll Hear that Nolia Clap? Yaâll hear that Nolia Clap?
