Go tell it on the mountain, over the hill and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain, to let My people go.

Who's that yonder dressed in red, let My people go
Must be the children that Moses led, let My people go
Who's that yonder dressed in red,
Must be the children that Moses led
Go tell it on the mountain, to let My people go.

Who's that yonder dressed in white, let My people go
Must be the children of the Israelite, let My people go
Who's that yonder dressed in white,
Must be the children of the Israelite
Go tell it on the mountain, to let My people go

Who's that yonder dressed in black, let My people go
Must be the hypocrites turnin' back, let My people go
Who's that yonder dressed in black,
Must be the hypocrites turnin' back
