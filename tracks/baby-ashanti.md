I don't remember feeling like this
Baby
Baby, I love you
Baby
Baby, I love you


I got this jones forming in my bones (From a man)
Who indeed took over my soul (Understand)
I couldn't breathe if he ever said (He would leave)
Get on my knees 'til they bloody red (Baby, please)
See, I don't know if you get it yet (Just don't know)
He's like a lighter to my cigarette (Watch me smoke)
I never knew another human life (Didn't know)
Could have the power to take over mine
So baby, baby


Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (Baby, I love you)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I love it when I hear your name, got me saying
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (Baby, I love you)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby


See, I could never feel alone with you (In my life)
I'll give up everything I own for you (Won't think twice)
Almost a shame how I'm mesmerized (Such a shame)
I lose my thought looking in your eyes (I know why)
Because your kisses make my lips quiver (And that's real)
And when you touch me, my whole body shivers (I can feel)
Now, I can see how another life ('Nother life)
Could have the power to take over mine
'Cause you're my...


Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (Baby, I love you)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I love it when I hear your name, got me saying
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (Baby, I love you)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Break it down


Baby, I can't see my world (I can't see)
Living here on God's green earth (God)
You don't know what you've done to me (Done to me)
I never thought I'd need you desperately (Desperately)
It's kind of sick how I'm stuck on you (Stuck on you)
But I don't care 'cause I'm needing you (I'm needing you)
And how I feel will remain the same (Remains the same)
'Cause you're my baby ('Cause you're my baby)


Listen, and when the world starts to stress me out (Where I run)
It's to you, boy, without a doubt (You're the one)
Who keeps me sane and I can't complain (Can't complain)
You're like a drug, you relieve my pain (May seem strange)
You're like the blood flowing through my veins (Oh)
Keeps me alive and feeding my brain (Oh)
Now this is how another human life ('Nother life)
Could have the power to take over mine
'Cause you're my...


Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (Baby, I love you)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I love it when I hear your name, got me saying
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (Baby, I love you)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby


Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
