He's got the potion and the motion
When I'm feeling low
When my love starts to flow
He's got the power every hour
He's the reason why my face is all aglow

Just one kiss from his lips
Is like taking Vitamin C
Oh you can't imagine what
A doctor does to me
(Doctor does to me)

Doctor Love
(Doctor Love)
He can cure my every pain
He can make me well again
Doctor Love
(Doctor Love)
He ain't got no competition
Only he writes my prescription
Doctor Love
(Doctor Love)
Doctor Love
(Doctor Love)
Oh Doctor Love

I needed a major operation
Never thought that I'd survive
From a broken heart
He took me in as a patient
You better believe he knew where to start

There's no need for me
To eat an apple everyday
Oh he's all I'll ever need
To take any pain away
(Take any pain away)

Doctor Love
(Doctor Love)
He can cure my every pain
He can make me well again
Doctor Love
(Doctor Love)
He ain't got no competition
Only he writes my prescription
Doctor Love
(Doctor Love)
Doctor Love
(Doctor Love)
Oh Doctor Love

Oh
(Doctor Love)
He can cure my every pain
He can make me well again
Doctor Love
(Doctor Love)
He ain't got no competition
Only he writes my prescription
Doctor Love
(Doctor Love)
He don't need no office light
Cuz he operates at night
Doctor Love
(Doctor Love)
What he does is keep me well
What he does I'll never tell
Doctor Love
(Doctor Love)
Doctor Love
Oh Doctor Love
Doctor Love
(Doctor Love)
(Doctor Love)

Doctor Love
Yes he does
Oh yes he does
Squeeze me
He holds me
Doctor Love

Doctor Love
(Doctor Love)
He ain't got no competition
Only he writes my prescription
Doctor Love
(Doctor Love)
He can cure my every pain
He can make me well again
Doctor Love
(Doctor Love)
Doctor Love
