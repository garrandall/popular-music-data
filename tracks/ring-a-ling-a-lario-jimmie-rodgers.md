I'm much too young to marry-o, marry-o, marry-o...
But if I should marry-o, then I would marry you.

When I was just a boy of nine, I fell in love with Adeline;
I kissed her tender lips of wine, and then I ran away.

Singin' Ring-A-Ling-A-Lario, what am I to do?
I'm much too young to marry-o, marry-o, marry-o...
But if I could marry-o, oh I would marry you.

When I was only seventeen, I fell in love with Bernardine,
I kissed her on the village green, and then I ran away.

Singin' Ring-A-Ling-A-Lario, what am I to do?
I'm much too young to marry-o, marry-o, marry-o...
But if I could marry-o, oh I would marry you.

When I had grown to twenty-two, I fell in love with Mary Lou,
I tried to run but I was through, she stole my heart away.

Singin Ring-A-Ling-A-Lario, this is what I'll do
You're old enough to marry-o, marry-o, marry-o
Old enough to marry-o
And I will marry you

This is ancient history, my family numbers 23
And all of them take after me, they kiss and run away

Singin' Ring-A-Ling-A-Lario, what am I to do?
I'm old enough to marry-o, marry-o, marry-o...
But if I should marry-o, then I would marrry you.

But if I could marry-o, then I would marry you.
