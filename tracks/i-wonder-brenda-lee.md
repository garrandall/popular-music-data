I wonder my little darling
Where can you be this moonlit night
Are you holding someone tight
I wonder

My heart's, my heart is aching
And I'm a fool, I'm a fool to let it go on breaking
Maybe I'll awaken, find that I'm mistaken
But I wonder

Baby, since we're through I've been through lovers' lane
Ah' but in my heart there's only pain
You went travelling, but will it last
While I'm travelling, I'm travelling, I'm travelling nowhere
Fast sweetheart
I wonder where, where, where, where little baby
If this new love dies where will you be
Will your heart come running back to me
I just wonder

Baby, since we're through I've been through lovers' lane
Ah' but in my heart there's only pain
You went travelling, but will it last
While I'm travelling, I'm getting no where fast sweetheart
I wonder, yes I wonder little baby
Will you think of me again today
Though I may be a million miles away
I wonder
