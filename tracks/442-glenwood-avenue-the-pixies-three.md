After school is over, we can have some fun
Bring the boys, and baby, I want you to come
All my girlfriends are gonna be there
(We'll be there)
Let me tell you where

442 Glenwood Avenue
442 Glenwood Avenue
Come along, come on, just tap twice on this door
442 Glenwood Avenue

Goofy Eddie's gonna bring his ukulele
Groovy Freddy's going to dance all night with Sherry
I can't wait 'til I see you there
(See you there)
Let me tell you again, the number's

(Fun, fun, fun, fun)
We'll turn the lights down lower
(Fun, fun, fun, fun)
We'll dance a little slower

(Fun, fun, fun, fun)
And when the party's over
You'll walk me home, now let me hang up the phone
But don't forget the number

442 Glenwood Avenue
442 Glenwood Avenue
