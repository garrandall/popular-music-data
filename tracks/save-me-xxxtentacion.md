Up there (Yeah)
Who do I have?
Heaven and hell, my friend (My friend)
I won't shed a tear
Let them see me in pain again


Hello (Hello), from the dark side in
Does anybody here wanna be my friend? (My friend)
Want it all to end
Tell me when the fuck is it all gon’ end? (End)
Voices in my head
Telling me I'm gonna end up dead (Dead)


So save me (Save me), before I fall (I fall)
So save me, I don't wanna go alone (Alone)
So save me (Save me), before I fall (I fall)
So save me (Save me), I don’t wanna go alone
