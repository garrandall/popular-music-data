The full measure of your giving
You don't yet understand.
A cupful of living
That you hold in your hand.

The full weight of your loving
Makes me lighter than air.
The tax I'm receiving,
Now I know that it never was there.

It started off just sticking around
With that wonderful feeling from you.
Now there's finally someone telling me
I can really give, too.

I know you know the feeling
That getting something for nothing is wrong.
Getting love is so easy,
Giving love takes so long.

It started off just stickin' around
With that wonderful feeling from you.
Now there's finally someone telling me
I can really give, too.

I've heard them saying at Christmas,
Now I can say it to you:
The feeling of giving
It's as good as im getting from you,
It's as good as im getting from you,
It's as good as im getting from you,
It's as good as I'm getting from you.
