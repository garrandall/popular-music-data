The mountain is high, the valley is low
And you're confused bout which to go
So I came here to give you a hand
And lead you into the promised land

Come on and take a free ride (free ride)
Come on and take it by my side
Come on, let's take a free ride

All over the country, I've seen it the same
Nobody's winning at this kind of game
We gotta do better, it's time to begin
You know all the answers
Must come from within, so

Come on and take a free ride (free ride)
Come on and take it by my side
Come on and take a free ride

Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Oh, oh, free ride

Come on and take a free ride
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Come on and take a free ride
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Come on and take a free ride
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Come on and take a free ride
Yeah yeah yeah yeah...
