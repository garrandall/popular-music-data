Now she's gone, from my life
And it nearly drove me out of my mind
Always thinking what she meant to me
All we left behind
Can't be afraid, startin' over
Gotta get up, start livin' again
When you're drownin' in your loneliness
The hurtin' never ends...
And the night rolls on
I search for some piece of mind
No, I can't be wrong
Won't get burned by desire this time

Gonna wait on love, holdin' on till I find the one
Wait on love, won't hold back
I promised myself, till it comes...
Gonna wait on love

Wanna get close with somebody
When a voice says I'm movin' too fast
It's hard to know when to walk away
Or try to make it last...
Still the night rolls on
Secrets are safe in the dark
And I stayed too long
I'm not gonna lie to my heart

Gonna wait on love, holdin' on till I find the one
Wait on love, won't hold back
I promised myself, till it comes...
Gonna wait on love

Someone I can run to
Just know that it's right
Trust my heart and soul to
For the rest of my life...
