I wish you would step back
From that ledge my friend
You could cut ties with all the lies
That you've been living in
And if you do not want to see me again
I would understand,
I would understand

The angry boy a bit too insane
Icing over a secret pain
You know you don't belong
You're the first to fight
You're way too loud
You're the flash of light on a burial shroud
I know something's wrong
Well everyone I know has got a reason
To say, "Put the past away."

Wish you would step back
From that ledge my friend
You could cut ties with all the lies
That you've been living in
And if you do not want to see me again
I would understand,
I would understand

Well he's on the table and he's gone to code
And I do not think anyone knows
What they're doing here
And your friends have left you
You've been dismissed
I never thought it would come to this
And I, I want you to know
Everyone's got to face down the demons
Maybe today
You could put the past away

I wish you would step back from
That ledge my friend
You could cut ties with all the lies
That you've been living in
And if you do not want to see me again
I would understand, I would understand
I would understand,

I would understand
I would understand,
Understand

Can you put the past away
I wish you would step back
From that ledge my friend
(I would understand)
I wish you would step back
From that ledge my friend
(I would understand)
I wish you would step back
From that ledge my friend
And I would understand

(I wish you would step back
From that ledge my friend)
I would understand
(I wish you would step back
From that ledge my friend)
And I would understand
