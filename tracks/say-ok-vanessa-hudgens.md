You are fine
You are sweet
But I'm still a bit naive with my heart
When you're close I don't breathe
I can't find the words to speak
I feel sparks
But I don't want to be into you
If you're not looking for true love
No I don't wanna start seein' you
If I can't be your only one

So tell me when it's not alright
When it's not OK
Will you try to make me feel better?
Will you say alright? (say alright)
Will you say OK? (Say OK)
Will you stick with me through whatever?
Or run away
(Say that it's gonna be alright. That it's gonna be OK)
Say OK

When you call I don't know if I should pick up the phone every time
I'm not like all my friends who keep calling up the boys, I'm so shy
But I don't want to be into you
If you don't treat me the right way
See I can only start seeing you
If you can make my heart feel safe (feel safe)

When it's not alright
When it's not OK
Will you try to make me feel better?
Will you say alright? (say alright)
Will you say OK? (Say OK)
Will you stick with me through whatever?
Or run away
(Say that it's gonna be alright. That it's gonna be OK
Don't run away, don't run away)

Let me know if it's gonna be you
Boy, you've got some things to prove
Let me know that you'll keep me safe
I don't want you to run away so
Let me know that you'll call on time
Let me know that you'll help me shine
Will you wipe my tears away
Will you hold me close and say

When it's not alright
When it's not OK
Will you try to make me feel better
Will you say alright? (say alright)
Will you say OK? (Say OK)
Will you stick with me through whatever?
Or run away
(Say that it's gonna be alright. That it's gonna be OK)
Say OK
(Don't run away, don't run away)
(Say that it's gonna be alright. That it's gonna be OK, don't run away)
Will you say OK
(Say that it's gonna be alright. That it's gonna be OK, don't run away)
Will you say OK...
