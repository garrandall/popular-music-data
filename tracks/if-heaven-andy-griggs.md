If heaven was an hour, it would be twilight
When the fireflies start their dancin' on the lawn
And supper's on the stove and mamma's laughin'
And everybody's workin' day is done

If heaven was a town it would be my town
Oh, on a summer day in 1985
And everything I wanted was out there waitin'
And everyone I loved was still alive

Don't cry a tear for me now baby
There comes a time we all must say goodbye
And if that's what heaven's made of
You know I ain't afraid to die

If heaven was a pie it would be cherry
So cool and sweet and heavy on your tongue
And just one bite would satisfy your hunger
And there'd always be enough for everyone

If heaven was a train it sure would be a fast one
That could take this weary trav'ler 'round the bend
And if heaven was a tear it'd be my last one
And you'd be in my arms again

Don't cry a tear for me now baby
There comes a time we all must say goodbye
And if that's what heaven's made of
You know I ain't afraid to die

Yeah, if that's what heaven's made of
You know I ain't afraid to die
