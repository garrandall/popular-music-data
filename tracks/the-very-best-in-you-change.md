This is for the very best in you
This is for the very best in you

Something very special
So sweet, so refined
And you're such a lovely lady, yeah
And I'm so glad that
Your heart is really mine

I get excited
About this love that we found
And I'm glad we got together
It's so nice having you around me

This is for the very best in you
Because there's no one better
This is for the very best in you

Oh, girl, everything I hoped for, yeah
In a girl I could find
You're so understanding, baby
You're so sweet and you're so kind

I really mean it, oh, baby
From my heart, I must say
I'm never, never, ever
Gonna leave you, yeah
Cause right here is
Where I'll always stay

You are my lover
And you turn me on
I thought I'd never find
A love so strong

Please, say to me
This love will never end

This is for the very best in you
Because there's no one better
This is for the very best in you
It's all for you

This is for the very best in you
This is for, this is for
This is for the very best in you
All the love I have within

This is for the very best in you
I get excited bout you, baby
This is for the very best in you

Oh, something very special
So sweet, so refind
And you're such a fine lady
I'm so glad that your body's mine

You are my lover

A love so strong

Please, say to me
