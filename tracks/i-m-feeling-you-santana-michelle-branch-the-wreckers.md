Sometimes I imagine the world without you
But most time I'm just so happy that I ever found you
Its a complicated web
That you weave inside my head
So much pleasure with such pain
We always always stay the same


I'm feeling the way you cross my mind
And you save me in the knick of time
I'm riding the highs I'm digging the lows
Cuz at least I feel alive
I never faced so many emotional days
But my life is good I'm feeling you
I'm feeling you


You go and then I can finally breath in
Cuz baby I know in the end you're never leaving
Well we rarely ever sane
I drive you crazy and you do the same
But your fire fills my soul
And it warms me up like no one knows


I'm feeling the way you cross my mind
And you save me in the knick of time
I'm riding the highs I'm digging the lows
Cuz at least I feel alive
I never faced so many emotional days
But my life is good I'm feeling you
I'm feeling you
