And when God gave out rhythm
He sure was good to you
You can add, subtract, multiply and divide
By two

I know today's your birthday
And I did not buy no rose
But I wrote this song instead and I call it
"Popsicle Toes"

Popsicle toes
Popsicle toes are always froze
Popsicle toes
You're so brave to expose all those popsicle toes

You must have been Miss Pennsylvania
With all this pulchritude
How come you always load your Pentax
When I'm in the nude?

We oughta have a birthday party
And you can wear you birthday clothes
We can hit the floor
And go explore those
Popsicle toes

You got the nicest North America
This sailor ever saw
I'd like to feel your warm Brazil
And touch your Panama

But your Tierra del Fuegos
Are nearly always froze
We gotta see saw
Until we unthaw those
Popsicle toes

Popsicle toes
Popsicle toes are always froze
Popsicle toes
You're so brave to expose all those popsicle toes
