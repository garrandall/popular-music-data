If I know one thing that's true
It ain't what you say, it's what you do
And you don't say much, yeah, that's true
But I listen when you do


A thousand years go by
But love don't die


If I know one thing that's true
It's that I'm never leaving you
And you don't say much, yeah, that's true
But I lose it when you do


Don't let them tell no lies
Love don't die


No matter where we go
Or even if we don't
And even if they try
They'll never take my body from your side
Love don't die


If there is one thing that's true
It's not what I say, it's what I do
And I say too much, yeah, that's true
So just listen to what I do


A thousand years go by
But love don't die


No matter where we go
Or even if we don't
And even if they try
They'll never take my body from your side
Love don't die


You can break it up, you can burn it down
You can box it in, bury it in the ground
You can close it off, can turn it away
Try to keep it down six feet in the ground
But love don't die


No matter where we go
Or even if we don't
And even if they try
They'll never take my body from your side
Love don't die
No matter where we go
Or even if we don't
And even if they try
They'll never take my body from your side
Love don't die
