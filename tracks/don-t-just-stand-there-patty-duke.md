Please don't just stand there

Come and kiss me like before

Please don't just stand there

Looking down at the floor

If something is wrong

Give me just one little sign

If there's someone else, please tell me

Tell me, what, what, what

What's on your mind

Once when we'd meet

You'd run to hold me tight

Life was so sweet until tonight

Please don't just stand there

Get it over if we're through

Please don't just stand there

While my heart breaks in two

Knowing I care, how can you be so unkind?

Please stop hurting me and help me

Tell me, what, what, what

What's on your mind

If it's a game

I don't want to play it

And if it's goodbye

Why can't you just say it?

Why make me cry like you do?

How can you be so unkind?

Please start loving me or leave me

Tell me, what, what, what

What's on your mind

Don't just stand there

Tell me, what, what, what

What's on your mind

Don't just stand there

Tell me, what, what, what

What's on your mind

Don't just stand there

Tell me, what, what, what

What's on your mind
