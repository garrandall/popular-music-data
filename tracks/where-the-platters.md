Where is the heaven that we hoped would be?
Where is the gladness my heart came to see?
Where is the rapture we can't recapture?
Where is the future your love promised to me?

Where is the promise of the joy we knew?
Where are you, princess, are you crying too?
Why has it ended, was love pretended?
Where is the splendid world I shared with you?

Where are you? Where are you?
Why, oh, why they all now have died?
Where are you, darling, are you crying too?
