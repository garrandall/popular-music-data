Bobby, I like the way this sound (Yeah!)
Wanna try it one more time? (One more time!)
One more time? (One more time!)
Licking stick, ha, licking stick
Wait a minute, Maceo
People, people, looka here

I don't profess to be no teacher, these are my latest outlooks
She's got to get herself back in the mathematic books
Do you hear me now? All right
I wanna tell you one more time
I wanna tell you one more time
I wanna tell you one more time
Junior don't kill me with his, with his lazy strokes
When he take his feet off the ground
Doing the Mashed Potatoes, out there in the flow
Sometimes he think he's doing the James Brown
Sister says the dance you're doing is the latest thing
People now begin to talk
Ha, she jumped back in that soulful stride
Jumped back, do the Camel Walk
Come on, ha, come on, come on, come on, come on, OW!

Mama, come here quick
And bring me that licking stick - whoop her
Mama, come here quick - get it
And bring that licking stick
Mama, mama, mama, OH!
Mama, come here quick
And bring that licking stick
Mama, come here quick, hey
And bring that licking stick
Licking stick, licking stick
Licking stick, OH!
Licking stick, licking stick
Licking stick
