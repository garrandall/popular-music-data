What of the dollar you murdered for
Is that the one fighting for your soul
Or your brotherâs the one that youâre running from
But if you got money, fuck it, 'cause I want some

B.I.G.
Fucking with me
Oh god
Whoa
OK


Ainât nobody fuckinâ with my
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
Ainât nobody fresher than my motherfucking
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
As I look around, they donât do it like my
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
And all these bad bitches, man, they want the
They want the, they want the


I tell a bad bitch do whatever I say
My block behind me like Iâm coming out the driveway
Itâs grind-day, from Friday, to next Friday
I been up straight for nine days, I need a spa day
She tryna get me that poo tang
I might let my crew bang
My crew deeper than Wu Tang
Iâm rolling with (Huh) fuck Iâm saying?
Girl, you know my crew name
You know 2 Chainz? Scrrr!
Iâm pullinâ up in that Bruce Wanye
But Iâm the fuckinâ villain, man, they kneeling when I walking in the building
Freaky women I be feelinâ from the bank accounts Iâm fillinâ
What a feeling, ah man, they gotta be
Young player from the D thatâs killinâ everything that he see




Yeah am talking Yeâ, yeah am talking Rihâ, yeah Iâm talking B, nigga Iâm talking me
Yeah Iâm talking bossy, I ainât talking Kelis
Your money too short, you canât be talking to me
Yeah Iâm talking LeBron, we balling our family tree
G.O.O.D. Music drug dealing drug cousin, ainât nothing fuckinâ with we, me
Turn that 62 to 125, 125 to a 250, 250 to a half a milli, ainât nothinâ nobody can do with me
Now who with me? Â¡VÃ¡monos! Call me Hov or jefe
Translation, Iâm the shit. Least that what my neck say, least that what my check say
Lost my homie for a decade, nigga down for like 12 years, ainât hug his son since the second grade
He never told, who we gonna tell, we top of the totem pole
Itâs the dream team meets the supreme team, and all our eyes green and only means one thing
You ainât fuckinâ with my clique




Break records at Louis
Ate breakfast at Gucci
My girl a superstar all from a home movie
Bow on our arrival the un-American idols
What niggas did in Paris got em hanging off the Eiffel
Yeah Iâm talking business
We talking CIA
Iâm talking George Tenet
I seen him the other day
He asked me about my Maybach
Think he had the same
Except mine tinted and his might have been rented
You know white people get money donât spend it
Or maybe they get money, buy a business
I rather buy 80 gold chains and go igânant
I know Spike Lee gon' kill me but let me finish
Blame it on the pigment, we living no limits
Them gold master p ceilings was just a figment
Of our imagination, MTV cribs
Now Iâm looking at a crib right next to where TC lives
Thatâs Tom Cruise, whatever she accuse
He wasnât really drunk he just had a few brews
Pass the refreshment a cool cool beverage
Everything I do need a news crew presence
Speed Boat swerve homie, watch out for the waves
Iâm way too black to burn from sun rays
So I just meditated the home in Pompeii
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
Every time Iâm in Vegas they screaming like heâs Elvis
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it
Shit is real got me feelinâ Isrealian
Like Bar Refaeli Gisele, no that's Brazilian
Went through deep depression when my mamma passed
Suicide what kind of talk is that
But Iâve been talking to God for so long
That if have you look in my life I guess he talking back
Fuckinâ with my clique
