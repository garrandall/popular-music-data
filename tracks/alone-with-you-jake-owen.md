It's springtime in the mountains and I'm full of mountain dew
I can't even read my catalog the way I used to do
I'm a sittin' in that little shed just right back off the house
Here comes ol' Jake with all the hounds but he's gonna hear me shout.

Oh, I won't go huntin' with you Jake but I'll go chasin' wimmin'
So put them hounds back in the pen and quit that silly grinnin'
Moon is bright and I'm half tight my life's just beginnin'
I won't go huntin' with you jake but I'll go chasin' wimmin'.

Let's go down to the meetin' house and wait till they start home
Them gals that live on Possum Creek will always leave alone
We'll run 'em down the corn row them sassy little misses
We'll scare them pretty gals to death we'll stop and blow 'em kisses.

Oh, I won't go huntin' with you Jake but I'll go chasin' wimmin'
So put them hounds back in the pen and quit that silly grinnin'
Moon is bright and I'm half tight my life's just beginnin'
I won't go huntin' with you jake but I'll go chasin' wimmin'.



Now wash your face and comb your hair it's darn near time to start
But let me tell you fore you go there's no one that's got my heart
Don't chase the one with the yellow hair that wears the dress of green
Well, that sweet thing belongs to me I know she's past sixteen.

Oh, I won't go huntin' with you Jake but I'll go chasin' wimmin'
So put them hounds back in the pen and quit that silly grinnin'
Moon is bright and I'm half tight my life's just beginnin'
I won't go huntin' with you jake but I'll go chasin' wimmin'.

Now I was headed for the general store when a silly thing I seen
They make 'em in the city it's called a magazine
I turned to page 32 and look at what I found
Them gals wear clothes that we ain't seen beneath them gigham gowns.

Oh, I won't go huntin' with you Jake but I'll go chasin' wimmin'
So put them hounds back in the pen and quit that silly grinnin'
Moon is bright and I'm half tight my life's just beginnin'
I won't go huntin' with you jake but I'll go chasin' wimmin'.

I won't go huntin' with you jake but I'll go chasin' wimmin'...
