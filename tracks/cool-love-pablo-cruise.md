A room full of faceless strangers
Here I am again
Suddenly, my eyes meet yours
Looks like I found a friend

Warms up as the night wears on
We're both feelin' good
Gonna take it to the end
This time, we're gonna find out
Find out, find out
Just how good it is, yeah

It's a cool kinda love
It's like rain in the summertime
Coming down
Yes, it's a cool kinda love
And cool love, baby
That's what it's all about

You don't have to say
You don't have to say a thing
It's just a feelin' that happens
And what that feelin' brings

Time ain't gonna change it
It ain't gonna take it away
It's gonna keep right on goin'
Every night and every day
Every night, every day
Hey-hey-heeeey, heeeeey-hey-yeah
(Cool kinda love)

Like rain in the summertime
Coming down, yeah
It's a cool kinda love
Yes, a cool love, baby
That's what it's all about, all right

It's a cool kinda love
It's like rain in the summertime
Coming down, yeah
It's a cool kinda love
Yes, a cool love, baby
That's what it's all about
It's a cool kinda love
You know it's a cool kinda love
