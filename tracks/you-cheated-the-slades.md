How can a woman eat up a man? - How can it be? How can it be? 
How can a lady cheat, well she can? - How can it be? How can it be? 
Well you know why and baby I could sit and cry and sigh 
And we know the reason why, how it can be 

Well you know why and baby I could sit and cry and sigh 
And we know the reason why, how it can be 
How can a loser change to a winner? - How can it be? How can it be? 
How can a daydream change to a has-been? - 
How can it be? How can it be? 

Well you know why and baby I could sit and cry and sigh 
And we know the reason why, how it can be 
Well you know why and baby I could sit and cry and sigh 
And we know the reason why, how it can be 

How can a tear drop dry up into laughter? - 
How can it be? How can it be? 
How can a lover, a lover turn it on the other?- 
How can it be? How can it be? 
Well you know why and baby I could sit and cry and sigh 
And we know the reason why, how it can be 

Well you know why and baby I could sit and cry and sigh 
And we know the reason why, how it can be . . . . aaaaaaahhhhhhhhh
