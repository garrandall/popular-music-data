There's a candle I keep in my window
And its burning brighter tonight
Through the storm and the winds of change
I'm sure that you can see the light

I never wondered, I never gave up
Cause a true heart never goes astray
Whatever road that you take leads you back to me
Cause our love is too strong to slip away

Like a river flowing into the ocean
I can feel you coming back to me
Cause our love is like a sacred emotion
And its burning bright for the whole world to see

It won't be long before I hear 
That knock on the door, that telephone call
If your journey takes you far away
I'll still catch you when you fall

Love's like a wheel turning round and round
The feeling fades but never dies
There'll never be any question or doubt in my mind
Cause the answer's right there in your eyes

Like a river flowing into the ocean
I can feel you coming back to me
Cause our love is like a sacred emotion
And its burning bright for the whole world to see

Whatever road that you take leads you back to me
Cause our love is too strong to slip away

Like a river flowing into the ocean
I can feel you coming back to me
Cause our love is like a sacred emotion
And its burning bright for the whole world to see
