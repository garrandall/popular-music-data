By the way
My name is Smarty Pants
I could win a man
With just one glance
And not too many men had escaped
Do my man wrong
Make him believe that he's to blame


They call me Smarty Pants
Looking for a man
All it took was just one glance
Call me Smarty Pants
From the day
I laid my eyes on Dan
I knew then, I had to win this man
So I got the hottest hot pants I could find
And I gave Dan somethin'
To really blow his mind


Nine months later
Looks like the joke's on me
Dan's still on the corner
And I'm a mother-to-be
They call her
(Smarty Pants, Smarty Pants)
(Smarty Pants, Smarty Pants)
(Smarty Pants, Smarty Pants)
