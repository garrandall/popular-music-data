Silhouette of a perfect frame
Shadows of your smile, will always remain (always remain)
Beginners love, soon fades away ah baby
We go on, I will always


long as I live (long as I live)
you will be
my first love (ah baby, you and only)
long as I live (long as I live)
you will be my first love
and I choose you again.


I'll keep an old candy-coated, valentine
Memories of you, you when you were mine
A tarnished ring, on a tarnished chain
Times keep changing
Come sun or rain


long as I live (long as I live)
you will be
my first love (and my only love)
long as I live (long as I live)
you will be my first love
and I choose you again.


see as long as I live

long as I live

i like it baby, sing to me

oh you'll always be my first love

you'll be mine and I'll choose you again
oo oo


oo oo
a tarnished ring
on a tarnished chain oh

times keep changing,
come sun or rain




long as I live baby

you will always be

I'll always love you baby,
my first love

for the rest of my life
you will always be

my, oh lady

oh babe
