I remember how
The sun came shining through the trees
Made shadows on the road
I was driving home
The morning after with the taste of you
Still on my tongue

You are my safety zone
I live and breathe in you

I'll never find a better love not in a minute
I'll never find a better love not in a minute
Never a better love, never a better love

On the harbour bridge
The rain was gently falling down
On a lazy summer day
Your face appeared there on my windscreen
You smiled and slipped away

You are my safety zone
I live and breathe in you

I'll never find a better love not in a minute
I'll never find a better love not in a minute
Never a better love, never a better love

You are my safety zone
I live and breathe in you
You are where I belong
I live and breathe in you

I'll never find a better love not in a minute...
