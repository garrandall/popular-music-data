Hardwood floors is a-breaking
The mini dresses really shaking
Good soul music playing loud
Havng fun with the party crowd

Hey, man, I'm down at the shack
(Down at Aunt Dora's)
Aunt Dora's love soul shack (soul shack)
Yakkity yak, that soul shack
(Down at Aunt Dora's)
Betcha that I'm going back (going back)

Through these toes
There ain't nothing but soul
I wanna stay right here
And let the good times roll (oh, yeah)

It might be one, man
It might be three
But time don't mean that much to me

Cause I'm down at the shack
(Down at Aunt Dora's)
Aunt Dora's love soul shack (soul shack)
Yakkity yak, the soul shack
(Down at Aunt Dora's)
Betcha that I'm going back (going back)

?????
Everybody is swinging
Doing the funky ??
Doing what the Africans would

Let me tell you that they're
Down at the shack
Aunt Dora's love soul shack
Yakkity yak, the soul shack
And I betcha that I'm going back
(Oh, yeah)

Aunt Dora's got on her
High button shoes
And wearing a mini
Log on
Dancing wild to the young folks sound
Having fun aplenty

Hey, y'all
I'm down at the shack
Aunt Dora's love soul shack
Yakkity yak, the soul shack
And I betcha that I'm going back

I got to tell you that
I'm down at the shack
Aunt Dora's love soul shack
Yakkity yak, the soul shack
Good God, I betcha
That I'm going back...
