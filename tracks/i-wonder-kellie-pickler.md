I gave away my first real kiss
In the rain on a Friday night
To the star of the football team
Underneath the stadium lights
I cried the day he told me he was movin on
And I swore I'd never love again
All summer long

I can still smell the blossoms of those sweet Magnolia trees
I can still hear the Bible stories that my grandma used to read
As years fly by, I'm still the same inside as I used to be
I guess there aint no changing girls like me

I rode with grandpa in his pickup truck
Standin in the front seat
Had my arm around his shoulder
I was his little diamond store queen
We listened to all those songs playin on the radio
Now I lay in bed and wonder
Where did all those days go

I can still smell the blossoms of those sweet Magnolia trees
I can still hear the Bible stories that my grandma used to read
As years fly by, I'm still the same inside as I used to be
I guess there aint no changing girls like me

I want to settle down but I need to be free
I might be afraid to fall
But I've still got a dream

I can still smell the blossoms of those sweet Magnolia trees
I can still hear the Bible stories that my grandma used to read
All the years fly by, I'm still the same inside as I used to be
I guess there aint no changing
I guess there aint no changing
I guess there aint no changing girls like me
Girls like me
Girls like me
