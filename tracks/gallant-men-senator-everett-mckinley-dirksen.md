Down through the years
There have been men
Brave gallant men who have died
That others might be free

And even now, they do it still
Brave gallant men know that
Someone must and so they will

Gallant men have built us a nation
Passed us a torch of flame
Let us hold it high
And light up the sky
With praise of our gallant men

Tyrants must know, now just as then
They cannot stand, not as long
As there are gallant men

Our gallant men
Have built us a nation
Passed us a torch of flame
Let us hold it high
And light up the sky
With praise of our gallant men

Tyrants must know, now just as then
They cannot stand, not as long
As there are gallant men
Gallant, gallant men
