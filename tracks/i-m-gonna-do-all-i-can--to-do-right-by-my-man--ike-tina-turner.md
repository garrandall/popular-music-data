He may never be
A Big man in this world...
Just another face in society
But he'll always be, in this eyes of this girl
Cuz he's the only real thing that
Ever happened to me...

And I'm gonna do all I can
To do right by my man
To be the kind of woman he wants me to be
I'm gonna do all I can
To do right by my man
To be the kind of woman he wants me to be

He may never be
A rich man, Lord know its true
He may always be
Just a simple poor man
But all the money in the world
Can't make me feel the way he do
And I just got to know
That He's my man

And I'm gonna do all I can
To do right by my man
To be the kind of woman he wants me to be
I'm gonna do all I can
To do right by my man
And be the kind of woman he wants me to be

He can make me be good
And he can make me change my ways
Do the thing a good woman should
And I'm gonna make him happy
Each and every day

And I'm gonna do all I can
To do right by my man
To be the kind of woman he wants me to be
I'm gonna do all I can
To do right by my man
To be the kind of woman he wants me to be
