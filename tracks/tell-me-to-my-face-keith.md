(Clarke/Hicks/Nash)
Will you try to justify the meaning, of the note you sent this evening, to my door your not deceiving me
I'd of thought that you'd have known me better, sending round an unsigned letter, facing you would be much better now
Is it just that you can't face the future with me, can't you tell me to my face
You just took the cowards way to say good-bye, how would you feel here in my place?
If at last I think I'm glad, to rid myself of you I'm sad, to think about the time I let you go
Then I turn and walk away, so please don't beg for me to stay, cause I know just what I
Will say to you
Is it just that you can't face the future with me, can't you tell me to my face
You just took the cowards way to say good-bye, how would you feel here in my place?
Tell me to my face your leaving now
Tell me to my face your leaving now
