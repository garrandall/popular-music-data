You can get that bass overload
I got that rock and roll

I got that boom, boom, boom
How the beat bang, boom, boom, boom


I like that boom, boom pow
Them chickens jackin' my style
They try to copy my swagger
I'm on that next shit now
I'm so three thousand and eight
You so two thousand and late

I'm on the supersonic boom
Y'all hear the space ship zoom
When when I step inside the room
Them girls go ape shit, uh
Y'all stuck on super A-shit
That lo-fi stupid 8-bit
I'm on that HD flat
This beat go boom, boom, pow


I'm a beast when you turn me on
Into the future cybertron
Harder, faster, better, stronger
Sexin' ladies extra longer,
'Cause we got the beat that bounce
We got the beat that pow
We got the beat that 808
That boom, boom in your town


People in the place
If you wanna get down
Put your hands in the air
Will.I.am drop the beat now


Yep, yep
I be rockin' them beats, yep, yep
I be rockin' them beats, yep, yep, yep, yep

Here we go, here we go
Satellite radio
Y'all getting hit with the boom, boom
Beats so big I'm stepping on leprechauns
Shitin' on y'all with the boom, boom
Shitin' on y'all with the boom, boom
Shitin' on y'all with the

This beat go boom, boom

Let the beat rock

Them chickens jackin' my style
They try to copy my swagger

You so two thousand and late
