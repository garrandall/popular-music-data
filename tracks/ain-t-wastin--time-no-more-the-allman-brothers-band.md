Last Sunday morning, the sunshine felt like rain
Week before, they all seemed the same
With the help of God and true friends, I come to realize
I still had two strong legs and even wings to fly


And oh I ain't wastin' time no more
'Cause time goes by like hurricanes and faster things


Lord, Lord Miss Sally why are you crying?
Been around here three long days, looking like you're dying
Just step yourself outside and look up at the stars above
Go on downtown baby, find somebody to love


Meanwhile I ain't wastin' time no more
'Cause time goes by like pouring rain and much faster things


You don't need no gypsy to tell you why
You can't let one precious day slip by
Look inside yourself and if you don't see what you want
Maybe sometimes then you don't
But leave your mind alone and just get high




Well by and by, way after many years have gone
And all the war freaks die off, leaving us alone
We'll raise our children in the peaceful way we can
It's up to you and me brother to try and try again


Well hear us now, we ain't wastin' time no more
'Cause time goes by like hurricanes
Runnin' after subway trains
Don't forget the pouring rain
