Artist: Myron f/ Spinderella
Album:  Myron
Song:   We Can Get Down

We can get down baby
Down, down, down, uh
When you come around baby
We can get down
Cuz we be gettin' down baby
Down, down, down, uh
We can get down baby
Down, down, down, uh

Let me take my time and hold you
I really wanna get to know you baby
Your body language is enough for me to feel
Love that's in your heart and I know that it's for real
Ooo baby, you don't mess around
I love the way we get down
Another minute we'll be in it, you and me
Lovin' you for days, can't you see that...

CHORUS
We can get down baby
Down, down, down, uh
We can get down baby
Down, down, down, uh
When you come around baby
We can get down
Cuz we be gettin' down baby
Down, down, down, uh

Girl, you know I'm tryin' to get you open
I'll rub you from your head to your toes in body lotion
Put away all your insecurities
I'll be there for you physically, mentally
Puttin' in work
If you ain't satisfied then my feelings get hurt
When it comes to love I take it personal
I'm always there for you and I'm hopin' that you know...

CHORUS

If ever a time, if ever a time goes by
That you miss me and my rhyme
Just call me baby and I will be right there
Anytime you want it babe, anytime or anyplace
Anytime that you come around, yeah

Well you're gettin' down with Spinderella
And everything is gel
Don't worry 'bout a thing sweetheart
You're doing swell, can't you tell?
You never thought you'd fall when you fell
But you be blowin' up my spot so good I'm feeling swell
Now ??? never knew me
It's how you do me with them shoppin' sprees
Myron got me locked like freeze
Keep it hot all day cuz I digs you a lot
So however you will do it keep a-rockin' my spot

CHORUS
