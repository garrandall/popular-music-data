I want you
I need you, I love you
There's no one
But you in my heart

I swear by the
Moon high above you
It's always been you
From the start

When you're not around
I feel so out of place
But, oh, what a feeling
Each time I embrace you

For always and always
I'll love you
There's no one
But you in my heart

When you're not around
I feel so out of place
But, oh, what a feeling
Each time I embrace you

For always and always
I'll love you
There's no one
But you in my heart

There's no one
But you in my heart
