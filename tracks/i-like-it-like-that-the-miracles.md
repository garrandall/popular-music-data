Clap your hands now everybody
We're gonna have some fun tonight
We're gonna sing, shout, and knock ourselves out
Everything's gonna be alright (Alright)
Now let the bassman start playin'
He's gonna come in right on time
He's gonna add a beat to make you pat your feet
Everything's gonna work out fine (Work out fine)


And we can say I like it like that (I like it like that)
I like it like that (I like it like that)
Oh, that's where it's at and I like it like that


Now after a man finds hisself a woman
She doesn't have to be a beauty queen
And then she holds you tight, she makes you feel alright
Any man that I've ever seen


He's got to say, I like it like that (I like it like that)
Oh, I like it like that (Oh, I like it like that)
Oh, that, I'm trying to tell you (Oh, that's where it's at, that's where
It's at, oh, that's where it's at) and I like it like that


I like it like that (I like it like that)
I like it like that (I like it like that)
I like it like that (I like it like that)


Now I know why my mama, taught me to be true
She just a know one day that you would come my way
And I would fall in love with you


And you could say I like it like that (I like it like that)
Oh, I like it like that (Oh, I like it like that)
(oh, that's (I'm trying to tell you)where it's at, that's where it's at
Oh that's where it's at) Everybody sing now
