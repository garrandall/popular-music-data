Easton

There's a chick in the magazine we all know
(Annie Fanny, yeah, yeah, so fine)
She's a swingin' little chick we all know
(Annie Fanny, yeah, yeah, so fine)

And what she's got she doesn't owe to luck
(Annie Fanny, yeah, yeah, so fine)
She owes it to a cat named Daddy Warbucks
(Annie Fanny, yeah, yeah, so fine)

She saves the world, there's no one bolder
(Annie Fanny, yeah, yeah, so fine)
She does all this and never gets any older
(Annie Fanny, yeah, yeah, so fine)

(Annie Fanny) she does all this and you wouldn't surmise
(Annie Fanny) this chick needs no disguise
(Annie Fanny) here's a thing that would be the prize
(Annie Fanny) to get Annie Fanny a pair of eyes

(Annie Fanny, yeah, yeah, so fine)
She always gets saved by a pooch named Sandy
(Annie Fanny, yeah, yeah, so fine)

But the dog's in trouble and it's a sin
(Annie Fanny, yeah, yeah, so fine)
He's as blind as Fanny, he needs contact lens
(Annie Fanny, yeah, yeah, so fine)

(Annie Fanny) she does all this and you wouldn't surmise
(Annie Fanny) this chick needs no disguise
(Annie Fanny) here's a thing that would be the prize
(Annie Fanny) to get Annie Fanny a pair of eyes, yeah

(Annie Fanny, yeah, yeah, so fine)
(Annie Fanny, yeah, yeah, so fine)
(Annie Fanny, yeah, yeah, so fine)
