Distant lover, lover
So many miles away
Heaven knows that I long for you

Every night, every night
And sometimes I yearn
Through the day

Distant lover
You should think about me
And say a prayer for me

Please, please baby
Think about me sometimes
Think about me here
Here in misery, misery

As I reminisce, oh baby
Through our joyful summer together
The promises we made
All the daily letters

Then, all of a sudden
Everything seemed to explode
Now, I gaze out my window
Sugar, down a lonesome road

Distant lover
Sugar, how can you treat my heart
So mean and cruel?
Sugar, sugar

That every moment when I spent with you
I treasure it like it was
A precious jewel, oh baby
Lord have mercy

Oh baby, don't go
Please, come back baby
Something I wanna say
When you left you took all of me with you

My Lord I wonder
Do you wanna hear me scream, plead
And please, please, oh please baby
Come back and hold me, girl
Baby please, please
