Distant lover, lover (lover, lover, lover)
Oh, so many miles away
Heaven knows that I long for you
Every night, every night
And sometimes I yearn through the day


Distant lover (lover, lover)
You should think about me
Say a prayer for me
Please, please baby
Think about me sometimes
Think about me here, hey
Misery, misery


As I reminisce, ah baby
Through our joyful summer together
The promises we made
All the daily letters
Then all of a sudden
Everything seemed to explode
Now I gaze out my window, sugar down a lonesome road


Distant lover, oh sugar
How can you treat my heart so mean and cruel
Sugar, sugar
That every moment that I spend with you I treasured it
Like it was precious jewels, oh baby
Lord, have mercy


Oh baby, don't go
Please, come back, baby
Something I want to say
When you left you took all of me with you
My lord I wonder, do you want to hear me scream?
Please, please, please
Oh please baby
Come back and hold me, girl
Oh baby please, please
