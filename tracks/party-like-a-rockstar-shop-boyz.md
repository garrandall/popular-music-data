IIIII... (IIII...) - party like a rock star
Do it wit the black, and the white, like a cop car
(Yeah!) WHOOP, WHOOP! Me and my band, man
On the yacht wit Marilyn Manson, gettin a tan maaaan!
(Cool!) You know me, wit a skull belt and wallet chain
Shop Boyz, rock stars, yeah we bout to change the game
(Change the game? Uh oh!)
They know that I'm a star (I'm a star)

Party like a rock - party like a rock star
Party like a rock - party like a rock star

As soon as I came out the womb, my momma knew a star was born
Now I'm on the golf course, trippin wit the Osbournes
I seen the show wit Travis Barker, rock star mentality
I'm jumpin in the crowd just to see if they would carry me
Bitches wanna marry me, they see me they just might panic
My ice make em go down quick, like the Titanic!
Yeah, I'm wit Da Shop Boyz, you know what we do
I'm surfin screamin "Cowabonga, TOTALLY DUUUDE!"

Party like a rock - party like a rock star
Party like a rock - party like a rock star
