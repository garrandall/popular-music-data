Why don't everybody put your hands together,clap along with the music
The song is not a very hard one to sing, but I'd like everyone to what I'm saying to ya

You're the reason, I want to live girl
I swear you're the reason, I want to give
You're a part of my body, you're all of my soulâ¦well
And a love like ours baby, is so sweet and mellow â¦oh girl

(Your love is the only love I know) It's the only love I'll ever need
(That's why I'll never let you go) naw,naw, I can't let you get away
(Your love is the only love I need Only love I'll ever need
I want to talk about it, gotta tell somebody bout it, tell somebody how I feel about you

(Tell the world), Tell the world
(Tell the world), Tell the world (how I feel about ya baby)
Ain't no shame, ain't no shame
(Tell the world), Tell the world
(Tell the world), Tell the world (how I feel about ya baby)

You're the person, you're the person, that God must have put here for me
Now tell me who's are you, but all my destiny, lawd
You're more just my woman, you're purpose in my life
For you I'd do anything, I'll make any, any sacrifice

(Your love is the only love I know) It's the only love I'll ever need
(That's why I'll never let you go) I can't let you get away
(Your love is the only love I need Only love I'll ever need
I want to talk about it, gotta tell somebody bout it, tell somebody how I feel about you

(Tell the world), Tell the world
(Tell the world), Tell the world (how I feel about ya baby)
Ain't no shame, ain't no shame
(Tell the world), Tell the world
(Tell the world), Tell the world (how I feel about ya baby)
