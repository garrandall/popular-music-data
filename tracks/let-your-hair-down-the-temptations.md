Well
Get down
Nah nah
Hi yah hi hi hi
Ah yah ha


Hey (Let your hair down) Oh, doctor and lawyer
(Get up...) And let your reputation sit a while
Hey hey (Let your hair down)
Hey, Mister Businessman (Let it down)
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
Hey Mister Businessman you're always on the go
You've made your fortune
Yet you're working harder than ever before
All those pills you're taking daily will never see you through
Cause none of them are prescribed for what's really ailing you (Let it down)
It don't take no doctor long to see what you got, well
Your life has turned into one great big knot
Hey yay hey now
(Let your hair down)
Can you let it down?
Let it down, let it down, awww
(Get up...) And let your reputation sit a while
Hey (Let your hair down)
Don't ever be ashamed of what you're doin' (Let it down)
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy - Hey hey hey


How do you do, Miss Saditty?
Uptight - You look such a pity
I've got some advice for you
Take this record in your room
Lock the door, and get some groove
Let it down (Let it down)
Let your hair down (Let it down)
Ayy hey
(Let it down, Let it down, let it all the way down)
All you got to do is let the music take your mind
Show your partners
Anything they can do, you can do better
(Anything they can do, you can do better) Well, well, well, well
This is the part of the song where the horns take the throne
Down (blow) dih down down hey


Let it down, let it down - hey
Let it down, let it down - hey
Let it down, let it down
Hey, let it down
Let your hair down
Hey, doctors and lawyers
(Get up) And let your reputation sit a while
Hey hey (Let your hair down)
Hey, Mister Businessman (Let it down)
Don't you know - all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
Hey hey hey (Let your hair down)
Let it down, let it down, let it down, let it down
(Get up) And let your reputation sit a while - do it, hey
