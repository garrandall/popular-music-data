Well, I got a call from Rowdy 'round six o'clock
Saying he caught a hankerin' for a honky tonk
Wants an ice cold beer and a country song
But he didn't wanna stay out all night long
Well, I ain't the kind to let a buddy drink alone
But I can't turn it off once I turn it on

There's no stopping me once I get goin'
Put a can in my hand, man I'm wide ass open
The tick tock of that clock is like a time bomb
By half past ten I'm half past tipsy
At quarter to twelve, man I've done had plenty
The countdown's on when the first beer hits me
Five, four, three, two, one
Too many

After five diet Millers I was feeling loose
Singing karaoke to a TL tune
When a pretty little thing shot me a wink
She said, "Hey cowboy, could you buy us a drink?"
Well hey, baby doll, I will if you want
But I can't turn it off once I turn it on

There's no stopping me once I get goin'
Put a can in my hand, man I'm wide ass open
The tick tock of that clock is like a time bomb
By half past ten I'm half past tipsy
At quarter to twelve, man I've done had plenty
The countdown's on when the first beer hits me
Five, four, three, two, one
Too many

Now I've never been the kind to quit
Won't stop till I get to the bottom of this
And the night's still young
So what you say we shotgun one?

There's no stopping me once I get to goin'
Put a can in my hand, man I'm wide ass open
The tick tock of that clock is like a time bomb
Yeah, by half past ten I'm half past tipsy
At quarter to twelve, man I've done had plenty
The countdown's on when the first beer hits me
Five, four, three, two, one
Too many

Yeah, five, four, three, two, one
Too many
