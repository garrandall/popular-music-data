There comes a time 
To be free of the heart 
I wanna be ready 
Ready to start 
On a love journey 
Got places to go 
Made up my mind 
And I have got to let you know 

Heaven help the heart 
That lets me inside 
Heaven help the one 
Who comes in my life 
Heaven help the fool 
That walks through my door 
'Cause I decided right now 
I'm ready for love 

A funny feeling's coming 
Over me 
Now I'm inspired and open to being 
In a love place 
But it's out of my hands 
I'm telling you baby that you got to understand 

Heaven help the heart 
That lets me inside 
Heaven help the one 
Who comes in my life 
Heaven help the fool 
That walks though my door 
'Cause I decided right now 
I'm ready for love 
Ready for love 

I can't see what's out there for me 
And I know love offers no guarantee 
I'll take a chance and I'm 
Telling you something babe 
I got to let you know 

Heaven help the heart 
That lets me inside 
Heaven help the one 
Who comes in my life 
Heaven help the fool 
That walks through my door 
'Cause I decided right now 
I'm ready for love 

Ready for love 
Take a chance 
Take the chance on love 
The heart, the fool
