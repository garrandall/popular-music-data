Shake your love
I just can't shake your love
Shake your love
I just can't shake your love
Shake your love
I just can't shake...
Shake your love
I just can't shake your love


I'm under a spell again
Boy I'm wondering why
This is not a game of love but an emotional tie
I'm trying to figure out my heart (heart...)
But I can't offer you proof
Of why we should never be apart
And that is the (that is the) that is the truth
Oh...


Shake your love
I just can't shake your love
Shake your love
I just can't shake your love
Shake your love
I just can't shake your love
Shake your love
I just can't shake your love


Do you know why I stop and stare
And smile when you walk by
And how I call you up at night
I hang up the phone and I cry
If I never got to know you so well (I knew you well)
Maybe I would be fine
Baby you know that I can't tell
Why you should be (you should be) you should be mine oh


Shake your love
I just can't shake your love
Shake your love
I just can't shake your love
Shake your love
I just can't shake...
Shake your love
I just can't shake your love


Oh I know what you're thinking
I see it in your eyes
You want to give our love another try
I'm so glad you realize I can't...


Shake your love
I just can't shake your love
Shake your love
I just can't shake your love
Shake your love
I just can't shake your love
Shake your love
I just can't shake your love


Shake it
Your love
Can't shake
Just can't shake your love


Shake your love
I just can't shake your love
Shake your love
I just can't shake your love
Shake your love
I just can't shake...
Shake your love
I just can't shake your love

Shake your love
Shake your love
I just can't shake your love
Shake your love
I just can't shake..(say shake it)
Shake your love
I just can't shake your love

Shake your love
I just can't shake...
Shake your love
I just can't shake your love
Shake your love
I just can't shake...
Shake your love
I just can't shake your love
