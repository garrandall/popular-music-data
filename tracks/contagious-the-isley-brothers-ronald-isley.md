Ticka ticka yeah, ticka ticka uh
Ticka ticka yeah, ticka ticka uh
Ticka ticka yeah, ticka ticka uh
Ticka ticka uh
It's Mr. Biggs ya'll, ticka ticka uh
With another hit, ticka ticka uh
It's Mr. Biggs ya'll, ticka ticka uh
With some freaky shhh..., ticka ticka uh


Groove if you're ready baby (Whoop)
For me to drive you crazy (Whoop)
'Bout to make you my lady (Whoop)
Have you screamin' Ronald take me
Now we about to play this game
This freaky, freaky game
And I'm gonna let you win


Baby, body kiss
Meaning anywhere you want it
I will kiss
From your head down to your toes
Just make one wish
And I will kiss, from your (mwah), and your (mwah)
From you (mwah), to your (mwah)



Girl you haven't felt this kind of love for ages like (Whoop)
Girl what I got for you is so contagious like (Whoop)
Turn around and see that rear, embrace it now (Whoop)
I'm about to lay you down and taste it now (Whoop)
Now we about to play this game
This freaky, freaky game
And I'm gonna let you win




From the club, to valet, to my crib, the driveway
Body kiss is the name of the game that we play
In the door, we go, now you're out, of your clothes
Kissing you, all over, 'till you're screamin', for more


Say my name, Lil' Kim, it's you and me
Go to the V.I. and make some honey
Let me dance for you like a stripper in the club
Queen Bee gon' take that money
Let's do it in the Caddy, Sugar Daddy
Watch a movie in the jacuzzi
We can make an X rated version of (R. Kelly's)
Feelin' on my booty (Whoop)
Mr. Biggs, I really like how you kiss me
From my (mwah), to my (mwah)
You really handle your biz (Whoop)
I think I like this game, this freaky, freaky game
And I wanna play again
Mr. Biggs, Queen Bee



Body kiss, I will kiss
Make one wish
From your (mwah), and your (mwah)
From you (mwah), to your (mwah)
Body kiss, I will kiss
Make one wish
From your (mwah), and your (mwah)
From you (mwah), to your (mwah)
Body kiss, I will kiss
Make one wish
