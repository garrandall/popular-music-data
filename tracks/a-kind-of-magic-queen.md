It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
A kind of magic, no way


One dream, one soul, one prize, one goal
One golden glance of what should be
It's a kind of magic
One shaft of light that shows the way
No mortal man can win this day
It's a kind of magic
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
It's a kind of magic


The waiting seems eternity
The day will dawn of sanity
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh


Is this a kind of magic?
It's a kind of magic
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done


This flame that burns inside of me
I'm hearing secret harmonies
It's a kind of magic
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic




This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be, will soon be, will soon be done
This is (This is) a kind (A kind) of magic
There can be only one, one, one, one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done, done


Magic, it's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
Magic, magic, magic, magic
Magic, ha-ha-ha-ha, it's magic


Ha-ha
Yeah, yeah
Whoo
It's a kind of magic
