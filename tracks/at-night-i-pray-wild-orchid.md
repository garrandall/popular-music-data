So alone 
And this room feel so cold 
No one to care and no one to hold 
Yet the Lord knows 
That I'm needing somebody like you, just like you 

Can you see 
The passion burning in my eyes 
Do you sense 
The rush you give my heart 
And if you knew 
The secret way I feel for you 
Would you come running to me or would you turn away 


At night I pray (pray) 
With hope and faith (faith) 
As I lay me down to sleep 
I pray together we will be (at night I pray) 
And there will come a time (pray) 
You will be mine, all mine 
And I'll be yours, always 
But until that day comes at night I'll pray 

Should I feel 
These emotions inside me 
Should I reveal what's locked up in my soul 
I'm so afraid 
But it's something that you've got to know got to know 

How I want to touch you everytime you're near 
I long to feel 
Your body next to mine 
And if you knew 
The secret love I have for you 
Would you come running to me or would you turn away 



If all my prayers were answered 
Our heart would be enraptured 
We would find our heaven 
Inside each other's arms 

This lonely room would finally see the sun shine through 
But until that day every night I'll pray 
I'll get down on my knees, I'll get down on me knees and pray... 
Pray 

With  hope and faith (faith) 
As I lay me down to sleep 
I pray together we will be  (at night I pray) 
And there will come a time, (pray) 
You will be mine, all mine (and I'll be yours) 
And I'll be yours always, but until that day comes at night I pray 
Until that day comes at night I pray (Oh yeah) 
And until that day comes at night I pray
