So blue Lonesome too But still true

Rosie haunts me Makes me think of you

You're the one rose that's left in my heart, dear I love you, adore you, I do

Each night in dreamland we wander along
Telling love stories anew
When from a blue sky a black cloud came rolling
Breaking my heart in two
Oh we ought not to part
I have said from the start
You're the one rose that's left in my heart

Oh we ought not to part
I have said from the start
You're the one rose that's left in my heart
