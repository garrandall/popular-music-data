My nylons are melting down my legs
Your heart is pounding at my throat
I can't catch my breath
I lost it when your fingertips
Ran down my back and up my neck
Your kiss makes me feel like this
I'm so hungry for your sex
I'm so hungry for your sex
I got an appetite for love tonight
I wanna taste your sweet thing
I wanna feel the sting of your sex, of your sex
My body all painted lipstick red
We ripped the sheets right off the bed
My fingernails left fiery trails
Across your back, oh, tell me baby
How'd you like that little pussycat scratch
I'm so hungry for your sex
I'm so hungry for your sex
I got an appetite for love tonight
I wanna taste your sweet thing
I wanna feel the sting of your sex, of your sex
I'm so hungry for your sex
I'm so hungry for your sex
I'm so hungry for your sex
I got an appetite for love tonight
I wanna taste your sweet thing
I wanna feel the sting of your sex, of your sex
I'm so hungry for your...
