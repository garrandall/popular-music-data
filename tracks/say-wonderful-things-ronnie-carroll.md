Say wonderful things to me
I think you're wonderful too
Say wonderful things to me
Especially I love you (I love you)

They say I was living before we met
All of my yesterdays I forget
Now you are the one that I'm living for
And each day I love you more

(CHORUS)
So you must say wonderful things to me
I think you're wonderful too
Say wonderful things to me
Especially I love you (I love you)

The more that I see you, the more it seems
People should always believe in dreams
Now all of my dreams I'm dreaming of you
And someday they'll all come true

(CHORUS)

I'll never hurt you or make you cry
Love will grow stronger as years go by
Forever you'll be the one girl for me
I'll love you until I die

(CHORUS)

(Say wonderful things)
