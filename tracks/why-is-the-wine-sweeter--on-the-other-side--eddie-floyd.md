Why is the wine sweeter on the other side? Yeah
Oh there's got to be somebody just for me yeah
Oh yeah yeah you gave your love to the woman you need
I try to steal your woman's love for me
Just when I think everything is fine
Somebody' gone and stole that girl oh away from me
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me why?
Lord is the wine sweeter on the other side
Oh I got to know there's got to be somebody just for me yeah
Mmm
I put my trust in the woman at home
But I still afraid to leave her alone
Some other guy may come along
Who gives her more than he
Oh Lord now where, oh where can they be?
Why'd you steal that girl from me?
Why, I gotta know, is the wine sweeter on the other side?
Oh, darling baby there's just got to be somebody just for me, yeah
Mmm, there's just got to be somebody just for me, yeah
Oh, I'm down on my knees, darling got to be
Oh, somebody just for me, yeah
I ain't ashamed this evening
Darling there's just got to be, got to be, got to be somebody for me, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, got to be somebody that's just for me, yeah
Mmm..
