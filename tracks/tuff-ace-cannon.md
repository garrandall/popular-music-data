When you say it's dead and gone, yes, I know you're wrong
Cut and slash, sharpest knife, it won't die
Poison cup, drank it up, it won't die
No fire, no gun, no rope, no stone, it won't die
Why you gotta shove it in my face?
As if you put me in my place
'Cause I don't care if you or me is wrong or right
Ain't gonna spend another night in your bed, in your bed
Laws of man, are just pretend, they ain't mine
Love so good, love so bad, it won't die
Some talk too long, they know it all, I just smile and move on
Words ain't free like you and me, I don't mind
Why'd you have to be so mean and cruel?
The dogs are loose I'm on to you
You ball and chained together from the dawn to dusk
Can't call it leavin', 'cause it's just, I never came
I never came, I never came, I never came
I never came, I never came, I never came
