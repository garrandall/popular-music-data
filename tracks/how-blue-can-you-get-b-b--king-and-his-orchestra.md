I've been down hearted baby
Ever since the day we met
I said I've been down hearted baby
Ever since the day we met
Our love is nothing but the blues, woman
Baby, how blue can you get?

You're evil when I'm with you, baby
And you're jealous when we're apart
I said You're evil when I'm with you, baby
And you're jealous when we're apart
How blue can you get baby
The answer is right here in my heart

I gave you a brand new Ford
But you said: "I want a Cadillac"
I bought you a ten dollar dinner
And you said: "thanks for the snack"
I let you live in my penthouse
You said it just a shack
I gave you seven children
And now you wanna give them back

I said I've been down hearted baby
Ever since the day we met
Our love is nothing but the blues
Baby, how blue can you get?
