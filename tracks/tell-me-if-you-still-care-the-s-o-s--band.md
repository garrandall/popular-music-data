Tell me if you still care
Tell me if you still care


Let me know
Have you started to lose your love for me?
And if so
Will you still continue to be on my side?


Tell me if you still care about me (Tell me)
Tell me if you still care about me


I was so insecure with you
Did you still want me?
So I let go of the feeling that you
Were still all mine


Tell me if you still care about me
(Show me that you care)
Tell me if you still care about me


Must we both, go on being confused
And placing blame
My heart knows that you're my number one
Do you feel the same way too?


Tell me if you still care about me
(If you still care)
Tell me if you still care about me


Yes, I know that I still love you
You're forever on my mind
And it's so hard to let go what I feel for you
You blow my mind


And you've captured all my love with your sweetness
And I gave it to you, baby, from my heart
So if we really care for each other
Tell me, baby (Tell me, baby)
Why are we apart?


Tell me if you still care
If you still care
(Do you really care?)
Listen to my heart beat... for you, baby
(Tell me) if you still care about me
Do you feel the same way too?
Tell me (Ooh, tell me) if you still care about me
Baby, I still care
Tell me (Tell me) if you still care about me
Baby, you're my number one
Tell me...
And tell me do you still care?
(Yes, I care!)
...if you still care about me
Tell me (Tell me) if you still care about me
You're forever on my mind
Tell me (Listen to my heart beat) if you still care about me
Tell me (Tell me) if you still care about me
Do you feel the same way too?
Tell me if you still care
Listen to my heart beat
When you're near me, when you hold me
When you kiss me
Do you feel the same way too?

If you still care...
If you still care...
If you still care...
