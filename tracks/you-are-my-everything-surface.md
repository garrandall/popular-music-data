Oh, baby

You are my everything
You are my everything
You are my everything
You are my everything

When I'm feeling discouraged
Nothing seems to go my way
You lift me up
And give me courage
To face this world another day

I get excited when I see you
Shiver when I look in your eyes
I'm glad I found you
And I won't let go
And be forever by your side

You are my everything
You are my everything

When I need a friend to talk to
You tell me what I need to hear
And when I need someone to hold me tight
I turn to look
And you appear

No one else
Can do the things you do
And ask for nothing in return

Now let me show
How much I care for you
Giving you all the love that you deserve
Cause you are

You are my everything
You are my everything

You are the one in my life
And I want you to stay
In my heart you comfort me
That's why I can truly say that you are

You are my everything
You are my everything
You are my everything
