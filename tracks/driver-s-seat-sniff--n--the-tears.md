Doing all right
A little driving on a Saturday night
And come what may
Gonna dance the day away

Jenny was sweet
She always smiled for the people she'd meet
On trouble and strife
She had another way of looking at life

The news is blue (the news is blue)
It has its own way to get to you (oh)
What can I do? (What can I do?)
I'll never remember my time with you

Pick up your feet
Got to move to the trick of the beat
There is no elite
Just take your place in the driver's seat

Driver's seat, oh
Driver's seat, yeah

We're doing all right (oh)
A little driving on a Saturday night (yeah)
And come what may (oh)
Gonna dance the day away (yeah)

Driver's seat, oh
Driver's seat, yeah

Jenny was sweet (oh)
There is no elite (yeah)
Pick up your feet (oh)
Pick up, pick up (yeah)
Pick up your feet (oh)
Gonna dance the day away (yeah)

Driver's seat, oh
Driver's seat, yeah
Driver's seat, oh
Driver's seat, yeah

Yeah
Driver's seat
