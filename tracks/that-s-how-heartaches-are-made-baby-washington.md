(That's how heartaches are made, that's how heartaches are made)

They told me I was such a fool to love you
They say that you're the kind who'd never be true
Pretty soon the day would come when I'd be the sorry one
But I said that I'm not afraid; well
That's how heartaches are made, that's how heartaches are made

I went ahead and my heart opened the door
I gave you so much love, no one could want more
You pretended to be mine, how could you be so unkind?
With all the other girls you've played; well
That's how heartaches are made, that's how heartaches are mad

(That's how heartaches are made, that's how heartaches are made)

I know you're not sincere, and you'll never be
But, still, I want your kisses so desperately
I can never let you go
Baby, even though I know every rule of love you've disobeyed; well

That's how heartaches are made, that's how heartaches are made
That's how heartaches are made
