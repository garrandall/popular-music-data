Banshee playing magician sitting lotus on the floor
Belly dancing beauty with a power driven saw
Had my share of nightmares, didn't think there could be much more
Then in walked Rodrick Usher with the Lady Eleanor

She tied my eyes with ribbon of a silken ghostly thread
I gazed with trouble vision on an old four poster bed
Where Eleanor had risen to kiss the neck below my head
And bid me come along with her to the land of the dancing dead

But it's all right, Lady Eleanor
All right, Lady Eleanor
I'm all right where I am

She gazed with loving beauty like a mother to a son
Like living, dying, seeing, being all rolled into one
Then all at once I heard some music playing in my bones
The same old song I'd heard for years, reminding me of home

But it's all right, Lady Eleanor
All right, Lady Eleanor
I'm all right where I am

Then creeping on towards me, licking lips with tongues of fire
A host of golden demons screaming lust and base desire
And when it seemed for certain that the screams could get no higher
I heard a voice above the rest screaming 'You're a liar'

But it's all right, Lady Eleanor
All right, Lady Eleanor
I'm all right here in your arms
