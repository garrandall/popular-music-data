Last night when the moon was bright you called me darlin'
And you whispered pretty little love words in my ear
Was it just moon-talk, only moon-talk
Or did those pretty little love words mean you're sincere? ( sincere! )
Did those pretty little love words mean you're sincere? ( sincere! )

Last night when the moon was bright you said "I love you!"
And you painted pretty little castles in the air
Was it just moon-talk, only moon-talk
Or did those pretty little castles mean you really care? ( care! )
Did those pretty little castles mean you really care? ( care! )

I know that I . . . meant every sigh
When you hugged me the way you hugged me
An' you kissed me the way you kissed me
In the moonlight! ( Hubba Hubba Hubba Hubba! )

Last night when you held me tight and called me darlin'
And you told me that you would die if we should part
Was it just moon-talk, only moon-talk
Or did those pretty little love words come from your heart? ( heart! )
Did those pretty little love words come from your heart?
( pretty little love words come from your heart! )

Hmmm . . . moon-talk! . . . Hmmm . . . moon-talk! . . 
Makes you hug me the way you hugged me
Makes you kiss me the way you kissed me
In the moonlight! ( I love ya, love ya, love ya, love ya! )

Last night when you held me tight and called me darlin'
And you told me that you would die if we should part
Was it just moon-talk, only moon-talk
Or did those pretty little love words come from your heart? ( heart! )
Did those pretty little love words come from your heart?
( pretty little love words come from your heart! )

Moon talk, Oh moon talk!
