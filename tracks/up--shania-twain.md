I'm goin' up, goin' up, I'm goin' up (ooh)

It's 'bout as bad as it could be
Seems everybody's buggin' me
Like nothin' wants to go my way
Yeah, it just ain't been my day
Nothin's comin' easily

Even my skin is acting weird
I wish that I could grow a beard
Then I could cover up my spots
Not play connect the dots
I just wanna disappear.
Up--up--up--
Can only go up from here
Up--up--up--
Up where the clouds gonna clear
Up--up--up--
There's no way but up from here

Even somethin' as simple as
Forgettin' to fill up on gas
There ain't no explanation why--
Things like that can make you cry
Just gotta learn to have a laugh

Up--up--up--
Can only go up from here
Up--up--up
Up where the clouds gonna clear
Up--up--up--
There's no way but up from here

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah...
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

When everythin' is goin' wrong
Don't worry, it won't last for long
Yeah, it's all gonna come around
Don't go let it get you down
You gotta keep on holdin' on

It's 'bout as bad as it could be
Seems everybody's buggin' me
Like nothing wants to go my way
Yeah, it just ain't been my day
Nothin's comin' easily

Oh, oh, oh, oooh
Up--up--up--
Can only go up from here
Up--up--up--
Up where the clouds gonna clear
Up--up--up--

There's no way but up from here
(Up, up, up), (up, up, up), (up, up, up)
Oh-- I'm goin' up, I'm goin' up, I'm goin' up, I'm goin' up
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah...
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Yeah, yeah, yeah., yeah, yeah
