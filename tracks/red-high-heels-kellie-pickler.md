Baby, I've got plans tonight
You don't know nothin about
I've been sittin round way too long
Tryin' to figure you out
But you say that you'll call and you don't
And I'm spinnin my wheels
So I'm goin out tonight in my red high heels

I'm gonna call up that old boyfriend you said
Still has it bad for me
I'm gonna take him into town, flaunt him around
For everyone to see
Well, you said once yourself, baby
Yeah, you know the deal
Nobody holds a candle to me
In my red high heels

Oh, you can watch me walk if you want to, want to
I bet you want me back now don't you, don't you
I'm about to show you just how missin me feels
In my red high heels

All those games you tried to play
Well they ain't gonna work on me now
I put a barbed wire fence around my heart, baby
Just to keep you out
Well, you thought I'd wait around forever
But baby get real
I just kicked you to the curb
In my red high heels

Oh, you can watch me walk if you want to, want to
I bet you want me back now don't you, don't you
I'm about to show you just how missin me feels
In my red high heels

Oh, you can watch me walk if you want to, want to
I bet you want me back now don't you, don't you
I'm about to show you just how missin me feels

Oh, you can watch me walk if you want to, want to
I bet you want me back now don't you, don't you
I'm about to show you just how missin' me feels
In my red high heels
In my red high heels
In my red high heels
