You never give your heart to a stranger
And tell your secrets to a friend
You'll put your heart in mortal danger
They all desert you in the end

The more you live the more you love
Or so they say
The more you love the more you go away

They say that nothing lasts forever
And even true love turns to pain
Don't trust your feelings to a stranger
Don't want to go through this again

The more you live the more you love
Or so they say
The more you love the more you go away

The more you live the more you love
Or so they say
The more you love the more you go away

Don't ever give your heart to a stranger
Don't ever think that you can go on
You'll put your heart in mortal danger
Turn around and love is gone

The more you live the more you love
Or so they say
The more you love the more you go away

The more you live the more you love
Or so they say
The more you love the more you go away

The more you live the more you love
Or so they say
The more you love the more you go away
