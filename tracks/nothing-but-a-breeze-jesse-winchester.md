Life is much too short for some folks
For other folks it just drags on
Some folks like the taste of smokey whiskey
Others figure tea is too strong

Well, I'm the type of guy who wants to right down the middle
I don't like all this bouncing back and forth
Me, I want to live with my feet in Dixie
And my head in the cool blue North

It ain't nothing but a breeze in a small suburban garden
Not a single neighbor knows our name
I know the woman wishes we would move somewhere
Where the houses aren't all the same

Jesse, I wish you would take me where the grass is greener
I really couldn't say where it may be
Oh, some place high on a mountain top
Or down by the deep blue sea

And there we'll do just as we please
It ain't nothing but a breeze

One day I'll be old gray grandpa
All the pretty girls will call me "Sir"
Now, where they're asking me how things are
Soon they'll ask me how things were

Well, I don't mind being an old gray grandpa
If you'll be my gray grandma
But I suggest we go have our milk and cookies
In the shade of the old paw-paw

There we'll do just as we please
It ain't nothing but a breeze

Life is much too short for some folks
For other folks it just drags on
Some folks like the taste of smokey whiskey
Others figure tea is too strong

Well, I'm the type of guy who wants to right down the middle
I don't like all this bouncing back and forth
Me, I want to live with my feet in Dixie
And my head in the cool blue North

Oh me, I want to live with my feet in Dixie
And my head in the cool blue North, yeah, yeah
