Uh
(Taurus)
Uh

Gettin' high in the skybox, I can see, yeah (See, yeah)
Hot spot and it's plushed out, honestly, yeah (Yeah)
Exclusive drop, hm, Gucci socks, got 'em drippin' (Drippin')
Fuck the cops, we can't be stopped, just admit it

Hey (Hey), hey (Hey), hey (Hey)
Put some diamonds in Chrome Hearts lens
Bought a new Benz, lost some more friends
Stretchin' my hands, money all in
Fuckin' her friend, breakin' her back
Hundred in tens, count it in hands
Trust in God, then keep an FN
I gotta go (Go), I gotta spend
I drove a boat, I'll drive again
Ain't got no note, I ain't got no rent
I am a G.O.A.T., I am a man (Yeah)
We in the low, we smokin' dope (Ah)
We keep it close, you with the folks (Oh)
Give him a dose (Uh), give him some dope
Lil' bitty ho, you already know (You know)
Bitch, we the topic, just ask for the toppings, you know that they copyin' you, woah (You, woah)
They cleanin' and moppin', these bitches, they hop in, I couldn't fall out with the bro, uh
Hotter than Taki's, I like it, I cop it, ain't nobody stoppin' the Ghost, uh (Nobody stoppin' the Ghost)
Smoke Lodi Dodi, we sit in the lobby, we just rented out the whole floor, uh

Gettin' high in the skybox, I can see, yeah (See, yeah)
Hot spot and it's plushed out, honestly, yeah (Yeah)
Exclusive drop, hm, Gucci socks, got 'em drippin' (Drippin')
Fuck the cops (Uh), we can't be stopped, just admit it ('Mit it)

Paint the town (Town), and slime committed ('Mitted)
Bloodhound ('Hound), mmh, cold hard Crippin' (Cold hard Crippin')
Best part (Yeah), we got all the vibes with it (Vibes)
Head start (Start), you can't catch up, so forget it ('Get it)

That's no cap, I'm in the 'Ghini (Yeah)
This really rap, this ain't a gimmick (Uh)
I had to trap, now I got plenty
I'm in the castle fuckin' a genie (Genie)
I popped a capsule, she wanna wrestle (Woah)
I done got tackled, drunk on the Henny (Henny)
Turned to a saddle, I had to handle (Woah)
I'm 'bout to smack 'em both on the fanny (Fanny)
I put four twelves in the V12 (Oh), my Benz truck startin' to rattle (Woah-woah)
She say she smell I'm doin' well, when I wanna fuck, it don't matter (Uh-uh)
Bitch, I'm a shark, I'm not a whale, lean in my cup and my bladder (My bladder)
I got it on lock like I'm in jail, soon as they buck, they gettin' splattered (Get splat)
I'm 'bout to drop and no, I cannot flop, climbin' straight to the top like a ladder (A ladder)
Niggas play tough and they talk on the internet, but they ain't ever gon' hit 'em, uh
I took a loss and and it made me a boss, like now look, I'm doin' better than ever (I'm better than ever)
They cause you to flop, Biscotti when I'm coughin', I'm tryna get higher than ever (High)

Gettin' high in the skybox, I can see, yeah (See, yeah)
Hot spot and it's plushed out, honestly, yeah (Yeah)
Exclusive drop, hm, Gucci socks, got 'em drippin' (Drippin')
Fuck the cops (Uh), we can't be stopped, just admit it ('Mit it)

Paint the town (Town), and slime committed ('Mitted)
Bloodhound ('Hound), mmh, cold hard Crippin'
Best part (Yeah), we got all the vibes with it (Vibes)
Head start (Start), you can't catch up, so forget it
