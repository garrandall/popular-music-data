There I was, I was walkin' down the street
I just left a party you know girl
And I just know this guy was followin' me
He'd been followin' me all night
And to my surprise, I thought I saw him
Lurkin' in the shadows
And I said "Oh I hope this is him"
I've been watchin' him, watch me
And I'd just love for him to come up to me and say
"Hey baby I've been watchin' you all night long
And I just wanna know, can I have a moment with you?
I have some things that I must tell you"
So I said "hey hey hey


I was walking down the street
When this boy started following me
Now I ignored all the things he said
He moved me in every way


With his collar unbuttoned
By my side he was struttin'
Girls, he was really sayin' somethin'
Really sayin' somethin', woo
Alright now


Girls, he flirted every step of the way
I could hear every word he'd say
My resistance was getting low
And my feelings started to show


My heart started thumpin'
Blood pressure jumpin'
Girls, he was really sayin' somethin'
Really sayin' somethin', woo
Alright, now
Hey hey yeah yeah


Hey yeah
As he walked me to my door
I agreed to see him once more
Ladylike it may not be, no
But he moved me tremendously


Though he was bold
My heart he stole
Girls, he was really saying something
Really saying something, woo
Alright now
Oh, sing the song


Really sayin' somethin'
Really sayin' somethin'
