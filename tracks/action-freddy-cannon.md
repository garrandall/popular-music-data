Oh, baby, come on, let me take you where the action is
Oh, baby, come on, let me take you where the action is
Oh, baby, come on, let me take you where the action is
It's so neat to meet your baby where the action is

In every little town 'cross the U.S.A
There's a spot where the people can go every day
Just leave your problems and get away
Come on down and listen to the guitars play

Whoa, dance, dance, dance when you hear that beat
Whoa, dance, dance, dance get up off of your seat
Whoa, dance, dance, dance let your backbone slip
Let's go to the place on the Sunset Strip

Oh, baby, come on, let me take you where the action is
Whoa, baby, come on, let me take you where the action is
Oh, baby, come on, let me take you where the action is
It's so neat to meet your baby where the action is

If all day long you've been wantin' to dance
Well all night long you're gonna have your chance
So don't sit at home just a-twiddlin' your thumbs
You can't resist the sound of the drivin' drums

Whoa, dance, dance, dance when you hear that beat
Whoa, dance, dance, dance get up off of your seat
Whoa, dance, dance, dance let your backbone slip
Let's go to the place on the Sunset Strip

Oh, baby, come on, let me take you where the action is
Whoa, baby, come on, let me take you where the action is
Oh, baby, come on, let me take you where the action is
It's so neat to meet your baby where the action is

Oh, baby, come on, let me take you where the action is
Whoa, oh, baby, come on, let me take you where the action is
Oh, baby, come on, let me take you where the action is
It's so neat to meet your baby where the action is

Oh, baby, come on, let me take you where the action is
Whoa, oh, baby, come on, let me take you where the action is
Oh, baby, come on, let me take you where the action is
It's so neat to meet your baby where the action is

Oh, baby, come on, let me take you where the action is
Whoa, oh, baby, come on
