My hoes they do drugs
My hoes they do drugs
Can't trust shawty
Can't trust shawty
Cause my hoes they do drugs


Who am I  I am King Louie from the Chi
Molly, ecstasy and Mary, yea my bitches they stay high
I don't know if they write stories, but my bitches stay by
Give me head till I'm sleeping, compliment me when I'm fly
(Is you high?) Yeah I'm high, smoking heavy till I die
With a bad bitch beside, she addicted to my life, she ain't my wife
She just one night, I just fuck her, let you love her
Smash and pass her to my brother, there will never be another
Fu-fu-fucking up these streets, getting fucked up me and two freaks
Told them whores to get me B and the drugs they do not cheap
Bitches playing with their nose, got them taking off their clothes
Got a dick lip bitch from Houston, all she do is pour up fo's
Bump that lil bitch on the low, she was rocking off her duece
She said she want some Fiji water, or maybe some orange juice
I supply my girls with drugs, Pile em in this H2
I thought I was fucking one, but baby she brought two - (three)


Bad, bad little bitch
Make shawty in the A
She be dancin' all night
Fucking niggas all day
Bad, bad little bitch
On the West Side of L.A
Fuck you niggas all night
Pop them pills everyday
Now I don't know bout you cause
My hoes they drugs
Poppin' bean, pourin' lean
My hoes they do drugs
Now I don't know bout you cause
My hoes they drugs
Poppin' Molly, rolling weed up


She trippin' off that money, she dancin' like she be fuckin'
She looking like she be want it, she see the way a nigga be stuntin'
She movin' fast for them 20s, she choosin' up for them 50s
All my niggas throwing bills, I'm tryna see more than titties
I don't know her name but I want a brain
Bitch so bad she could see a whole frame
I just bump out in a new rain, on her mouth, I just came
Got them bitches pussies poppin' pills, we gone pop some more
These hoes on that molly and I'm a fuck them both
Pop that pussy open, pop that pussy open
Pour champagne on that ho, I'm a leave that bitch soaking
I'm on weed and alcohol, she on lean and Adderall
Got they pussies overflowing wet, Niagara falls


Bad, bad little bitch
Make shawty in the A
She be dancin' all night
Fucking niggas all day
Bad, bad little bitch
On the West Side of L.A
Fuck you niggas all night
Pop them pills everyday
Now I don't know bout you cause
My hoes they drugs
Poppin' bean, pourin' lean
My hoes they do drugs
See I don't know bout you cause
My hoes they drugs
Poppin' Molly, rolling weed up


Who am I, Pusha T I'm from the Vi
R-G add another I, N-I-A, and they hate
When they see me ridin' by, skinny tires, angel wings on that hood
Like they should, havin' on Leatherwood with King Louie from the Chi, is it true?
Got them bitches on that juice, poppin' Mollys and they loose
I put that on my Jesus (WOO!), black gold and it's flooded
G.O.O.D. Music Kid Cudi
My jeweler told yo jeweler that them niggas don't cut it!
Them niggas be hating, them hoes they be waiting
We turnt up like bright light, shit, every night is like Vegas
Eyes low, leaning back, sippin' on that Yeezy yack
Introduce to the lifestyle, it's long paper where we be at
(My hoes they do drugs) my black girl like to smoke weed
(My hoes they do drugs) my white girl like to go ski
(My hoes they do drugs) my Spanish girl wanna to roll E
(My hoes they do drugs) we mixed it up till we OD


Bad, bad little bitch
Make shawty in the A
She be dancin' all night
Fucking niggas all day
Bad, bad little bitch
On the West Side of L.A
Fuck you niggas all night
Pop them pills everyday
Now I don't know bout you cause
My hoes they drugs
Poppin' bean, pourin' lean
My hoes they do drugs
See I don't know bout you cause
My hoes they drugs
Poppin' Molly, rolling weed up
