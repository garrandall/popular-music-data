Scandal or shame
Uh, he really moves me
Drives me insane

When my baby calls I jump, jump, jump to it

I just can't wait till
Today at four
That?s when my sweet thing
Said he would call

Please don't keep me waitin'
It's 3:59
Ring-ding, hello, baby
Oh...come please be mine

Girl, I can't talk to you now, I got love to give
When my baby calls I got jump to it
I'm in a hurry, there's love to get
When my baby calls I jump, jump, jump, to it

You know when we talk we have a lot of fun, don't we, girl
Dishin' out the dirt on everybody
And givin' each other the 411 on who drop kicked who this week
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout

When my baby call, shout dee, dee, dee, dee (Jump to it)
