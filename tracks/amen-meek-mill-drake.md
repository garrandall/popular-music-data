I just wanna thank God
For all the pretty women he let into my life
All the Benjamins he let me count
Wealth and health, for my family
And lettinâ me BALL on these niggas


Now itâs a lot of bad bitches in the building (Ooh, Amen)
A couple real niggas in the building (Amen)
Iâm finna kill niggas in the building (Amen)
I tell the waiter fifty bottles and she tell me say when
And I say church (Preach)
We make it light up like a church (Preach)
She wanna fuck and I say church (Preach)
Do Liv on Sunday like a church (Ahh, Preach)


Bottle after bottle, drink until I overdose
Pull up in the Phantom watch them bitches catch the holy ghost
Everytime I step up in the dealer I be goinâ broke
Shorty wanna fuck me I say get on top and rollercoast
And I lay back, she go cray
Fuck me good, but she no stay
Murder on that pussy let her boyfriend get that DOA
Get it? And all I get is Frito Lay
Plus Iâm on probation, when they test me I just pee Rozay
Cause last night, I went hard, Peach Ciroc, Patron and all
Thirty racks on Magnum bottles, I think I was born to ball
Lookinâ like a million plus, fresh Iâm out that corner store
Hater I be doinâ me, you guys should be doinâ yâall
Iâm stackinâ money to the ceiling
All this ice thatâs in my Rollie I be chillinâ
And I just made a couple million
So I could take care of them children




Just bought my niggas some cane, so much it came with a plane
Bought my niggas some dope, so much it came with a boat
I just bought me a crib so big it came with a moat
For niggas jumpinâ the fence I hope you niggas can float
And I just hope that Iâm forgiven for carinâ âbout how they livinâ
And loaninâ a little money and keepinâ âem out of prison
I ainât lyinâ in my verses Iâm just telling you the basics
Of growinâ up with your friends and becoming the one that made it, Yes lord!
All gold, man I got these bitches soul
Talkinâ bout these other rappers getting old is even getting old
Worry âbout your followers, you need to get your dollars up
Me and Meek, young niggas poppinâ like our collars up
And good ainât good enough, and your hood ainât hood enough
Spend my whole life putting on, you spend your whole life putting up
Ainât no telling when I go, so there ainât shit that Iâmma wait for
Iâm the type to say a prayer, then go get what I just prayed for
Nigga, church




Lord forgive me for my sins, Iâm just tryna win
And she a devil in that dress but if she knock I let her in
And if she knock I let her in
I had her up by 12 o clock, then 3 o clock she wet again
Iâm screaminâ âOh Lordâ
That pussy good, that pussy good
Iâm tryin to hold on
I wish I could, you think I should?
She got that million dollar body
Shawty my Bugatti
And she said she got a man
we keep it secret illuminati
(Got Patron On deck)
And Ciroc all in my bottle
(Push it all on here)
She was on that Repressitol
(She take it all off)
And I take her off
And this bitch spinninâ like I hit the lotto
