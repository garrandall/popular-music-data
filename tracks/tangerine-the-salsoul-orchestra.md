(Male)
Tangerine - she is all they claim
With her eyes of night and lips as bright as flame
Tangerine – when she dances by
Senoritas stare and caballeros sigh
And I’ve seen toasts to Tangerine
Raised in every bar across the Argentine
Yes – she has them all on the run
But her heart belongs to just one
Her heart belongs to Tangerine
(Female)
Tangerine – she is all they say
With mascara’d eyes, and chapeaux by Dache
Tangerine with her lips of flame
If the colour keeps, Louis Philippe’s to blame
And I’ve seen clothes on Tangerine
Where the label says from Macy’s Mezzanine
Yes, she’s got the guys in a whirl
But she’s only fooling one girl
She’s only fooling Tangerine
