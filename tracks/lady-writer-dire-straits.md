Lady writer on the TV
Talk about the Virgin Mary
Reminded me of you
Expectation left to come up to yeah

Lady writer on the TV
She had another quality
The way you used to look
And I know you never read a book

Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
And I recall my fall from grace
Another time, another place

Lady writer on the TV
She had all the brains and the beauty
The pictures does not fit
You'd talk to me when you felt like it

Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
And I recall my fall from grace
Another time another place

Yes and your rich old man,
You know he'd a call her a dead ringer
You got the same command
Plus your mother was a Jazz singer

Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
And I recall my fall from grace
Another time another place

Lady writer on the TV
She knew all about a history
You couldn't hardly write your name
I think I want it just the same as the

Lady writer on the TV
Talking about the Virgin Mary
You know I'm talking about you and me
And the lady writer on the TV
Talking about the Virgin Mary
Yeah you know I'm talking about you and me
And the lady writer on the TV
