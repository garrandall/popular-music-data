Oh, oh, oh, yeah

Here we are in this
Old smoking room again
If your honey is your pleasure
That's all right

But there's an extra added goodness
In my heart for you tonight
If there's any such thing as a God
He must be here tonight

Ain't saying I'm right
Ain't saying I'm wrong
Ain't saying there's any
Such thing as sure love

Seems we been here
Many times before
It's too beautiful to be true

And I'm glad, I'm glad
That I'm here tonight
To share my night with you

Ooh, baby, oh, oh
Love me, baby, oh, yeah

You used to be
Locked up in the closet
And I couldn't find
I couldn't find the key

Used to be you looked my way
But you never see me
No, no, no, no, no

What has happened
Just to know that
From yourself, you cannot hide
And here, here is where I am
And it's you that's by my side

Ain't saying I'm right
I ain't saying I'm wrong
Ain't saying there's any
Such thing as sure love

Seems we been here
Many times before
It's too beautiful to be true

And I'm glad, I'm glad
That I got the chance tonight
To share my love
Share my love, share

Baby, baby, yeah
So glad I got to
Spend some time, spend some time
So glad I got you, baby, oh

So glad I got to
Spend some time, spend some time
So glad I got you, baby, yeah

So glad I got to
Spend some time, share my life
So glad I got you, baby, hey

So glad I got to
Spend some time
Spend some time
