In the morning you go gunning
For the man who stole your water
And you fire till he's done in
But they catch you on the border
And the mourners are all singing
As they drag you by your feet
But the Hangman isn't hanging
And they put you on the street

You go back, Jack, do it again
Wheels turning 'round and 'round
You go back, Jack, do it again

Well, you know she's no high climber
Then you find your only friend
In a room with your two timer
And you're sure you're near the end
Then you love a little wild one
And she brings you only sorrow
All the time you know she's smilin'
You'll be on your knees tomorrow

You go back, Jack, do it again
Wheels turning 'round and 'round
You go back, Jack, do it again

Now you'll swear and kick and beg us
That you're not a gamblin' man
Then you find you're back in Vegas
With a handle in your hand
Your black cards can bring you money
So you hide them when you're able
In the land of milk and honey
You must put them on the table

You go back, Jack, do it again
Wheels turning 'round and 'round
You go back, Jack, do it again
