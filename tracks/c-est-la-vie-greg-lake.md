C'est la vie
Have your leaves all turned to brown?
Will you scatter them around you?
C'est la vie
Do you love
And then how am I to know
If you don't let your love show for me
C'est la vie

Oh c'est la vie
Oh c'est la vie
Who knows, who cares, for me?
C'est la vie

In the night
Do you light a lover's fire?
Do the ashes of desire for you remain?
Like the sea
There's a love too deep to show
Took a storm before my love
Flowed for you
C'est la vie

Oh c'est la vie
Oh c'est la vie
Who knows, who cares, for me?
C'est la vie

Like a song
Out of tune and out of time
All I needed was a rhyme for you
C'est la vie
Do you give
Do you live from day to day?
Is there no song I can play for you?
C'est la vie

Oh c'est la vie
Oh c'est la vie
Who knows, who cares, for me?
C'est la vie
