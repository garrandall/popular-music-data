Come on, baby
Let's tell all the people
We found a way to hem the blues

Let's get together
And just start a rumour
That everyone will think is news


Love is warm, love is fine
Love is yours, love is mine
Love is free, love is true
Love is me, love is you

Come on, baby
Let's tell all the people
That love is such a wonderful thing

Let's get together
And just start a notion
That everybody else can sing


Come on, baby
Let's tell all the people
That love will never pass you by

Let's get together
And just start a habit
That everybody else can try


Come on, baby
Let's tell everybody
That love is still the greatest yet

Let's get together
And just start a gimmick
That nobody else can forget
