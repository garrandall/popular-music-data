Biscuit's in the house

All right, all right

All right now, now, now
All right
All right
Biscuit's in the house

All right
All right
All right now
Baby, it's all right now

Check out the sound
That's bound to move body
Move to the groove that proves the rock party
Coming along strong
I got nuttin', y'all
Move your butt, y'all
Here's a cut, y'all

Biscuit
The name for you to know
Straight from the New Kids tour to the studio
I carried the load on the road for a long time
But now it's my time to give you a high time

To make you shake things
Move, dance and lose it
You got a body that moves
Then use it

Al Capone
I'm the hip-hop heavyweight
I'm on top with a rhyme
And I'm never late

Never slip on the beat
Cause it's wicked
Grab the mic real tight
Cause it's kicking

Biscuit
I'm here to treat you right
So get hyped, y'all
It's all right, all night

All right now
Baby, it's all right now

Biscuit's in the house

All right now
Baby, it's all right now

Biscuit's in the house

I'll give you my name again
If you missed it
B-I-S-C-U-I-T
Biscuit

Kicking it hard and large
In all ages


Whipped up the track
And I said that I liked that
Then I flew to New York
And boom, we made contact
What we came up with is a killer
When I hit the stage
I get iller

I chill until showtime
You got a rhyme that's prime
Then get with mine
Static
I'll wax you like a table
Rhyme for rhyme
I'm hyped, ready and able

Biscuit
I'm here to treat you right
So get hyped, y'all
It's all right
All night

All right now
Baby, it's all right now
