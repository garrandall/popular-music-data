When hearts are passing in the night, in the lonely night
Then they must hold each other tight, oh, so very tight
And take a chance that in the light, in tomorrow's light
They'll stay together, so much in love

Though yesterday still surrounds you
With a warm and precious memory
Oh maybe for tomorrow
We can build a new dream for you and me

When life is passing in the night, in the rushing night
A man, a woman in the night, in the lonely night
Must take a chance that in the light, in tomorrow's light
They'll be together, so much in love

Oh maybe for tomorrow
We can build a new dream for you and me
