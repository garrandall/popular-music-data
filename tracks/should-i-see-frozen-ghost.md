Cover my eyes and ears
Til it all dissapears
How can you judge for me
What i should hear and see
You take away freedom of choice
Take away the right to voice
My beliefs and and all my views
You take away my right to choose

Chorus:
(na na na na na naaaah...)
Show me what should i see
(na na na na na naaaah...)
Make my mind up for me
(na na na na na naaaah...)
Show me what should i see
(na na na na na naaaah...)
What should i see

How can you censor my thought
What is right what is not
How is it you decide
What i should feel inside
Quoting god as you discuss
What is right and wrong for us
You inundate us with your views
You take away my right to choose

(repeat chorus)
You take away freedom of choice
You take away my right to voice
My beliefs and all my views
You take away my right to choose

(repeat chorus )
...make my mind up for me
Show me what should i see
