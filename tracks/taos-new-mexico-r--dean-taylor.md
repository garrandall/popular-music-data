My mama wrote a letter in she said:
"Son, you beter hurry, get home quick
Maria's tired of waitin' and you know she started datin'
Then she's got her kick"
Here I am in jail with no-one to pull my bail
And I just wanna go home


And when I do I'll never leave Maria alone
I'm serving time Taos, New Mexico
And I just wanna go home
I'm serving time in Taos, New Mexico
Never felt so alone


I just had to buy her things like pretty clothes and diamond rings
And so much more
The thing that I just couldn't see is that she only wanted me
Raggin' in poor
Here I am in jail with no-one to pull my bail
And I just wanna go home


And when I do I'll never leave Maria alone
I'm serving time Taos, New Mexico
And I just wanna go home
I'm serving time in Taos, New Mexico
Never felt so alone


Those awful nights are long and cold
What if she needs someone to hold while I'm away?
I can see her by the fire eatin' cheese and getting higher
With Don Jos√©
Here I am in jail with no-one to pull my bail
And I just wanna go home


And when I do I'll never leave Maria alone
I'm serving time Taos, New Mexico
And I just wanna go home
I'm serving time in Taos, New Mexico
Never felt so alone
