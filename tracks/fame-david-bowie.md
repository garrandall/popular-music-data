Ground Control to Major Tom
Commencing countdown, engines on
Check ignition and may God's love be with you

This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare



Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time



Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with Weird and Gilly,
And The Spiders from Mars.
He played it left hand, but made it too far,
Became the special man,
Then we were Ziggy's Band



Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back on Suffragette City
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight...she's all right

Oh, wham bam thank you ma'am!

Suffragette City



You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl

Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel Rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel Rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so!



There's a brand new dance
But I don't know its name
Oooh, fashion!
That people from bad homes
Do again and again
Oooh, fashion!

Fashion! Turn to the left
Fashion! Turn to the right
Oooh, fashion!
We are the goon squad
And we're coming to town
Beep-beep



Fame, makes a man take things over
Fame, lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame, puts you there where things are hollow
Fame

Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame, fame, fame, fame



Put on your red shoes and dance the blues

Let's sway to the song
They're playin' on the radio

If you say run, I'll run with you
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall
Into my arms
And tremble like a flower



I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them, just for one day
We can be Heroes, just for one day
We can be Heroes, just for one day

We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes, just for one day...
