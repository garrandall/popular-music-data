Oh, you don't compare, don't fit in with 'em, do you get me?
Judgin' by the way you open up, you get me
Oh, out of this world, hands on, baby, now you send me
Lookin' at the way we're blendin' in, you get me

Ha-ha-how you get me
Ha-ha-how you get me

See, you lookin' beyond the surface
Can tell by the questions you're asking
You got me low-key nervous
It feels like we're on the same wave, yeah
Never intended to relate, I mean, what are the chances?
Never thought I'd connect with you, not in these circumstances

Oh, you don't compare, don't fit in with 'em, do you get me?
Judgin' by the way you open up, you get me
Oh, out of this world, hands on, baby, now you send me
Lookin' at the way we're blendin' in, you get me

Ha-ha-how you get me
Ha-ha-how you get me


Oh, there's so much chemistry
Like a chemist how you finishin' my sentences
In the center, no, we can't deny the synergy
How 'bout reapin' all the benefits? Yeah
Never intended to relate, I mean, what are the chances?
Never thought I'd connect with you, not in these circumstances, no


Oh, you don't compare, don't fit in with 'em, do you get me?
Judgin' by the way you open up, you get me (Yeah, you really get me, oh oh
Oh, out of this world, hands on, baby, now you send me (Oh, that's where you send me)
Lookin' at the way we're blendin' in, you get me (Oh, you really get me)

Ha-ha-how you get me (Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oh
Ha-ha-how you get me (Ye-e-e-e-e-e-ah)

Oh, get me, yeah
Get me, yeah
Get me, yeah
Get me, yeah
