Come with me
Close your eyes and touch what greets you there
Reaching out
Stretch your hands across the sea
Come with me
Close your eyes and touch what meets you there
Reaching out
Stretch your hands across the sea

Sitting in my room, nothing much to say
I heard you calling a thousand miles away
I did not mean to hurt you, you took me by surprise
There is still a chance if we just close our eyes

Oh lady

Come with me
Close your eyes and touch what greets you there
Reaching out
Stretch your hands across the sea
Come with me
Close your eyes and touch what meets you there
Reaching out
Stretch your hands across the sea

I can't explain this feeling
I won't begin to try
There is still a chance if we just close our eyes
