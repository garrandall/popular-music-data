Y'all know what this is


Only thing that keeps me up (Ha), when I'm feeling down
I don't know about you, but I gotta keep mines around
'Cause I done looked, I done searched, and it's hard to find
Another shorty like mine (Uh-huh), baby, yes, I'm
Addicted to how we kick it, everything you say to me (This is going out to all the shorties around the world)
Never knew it could be so wicked, hoping that you stay with me
Search around the world but you will never find (Uh)
Another shorty like mine (C'mon), shorty like mine
I tell my niggas that uh you got a girl but she ain't nothing like mine (Uh)
Cute face nice size like mine
Stay kitted, hood with like mine (Ha)
Mean walk, talk the talk, let me tell you some more (Woo)


I knew that when I ran into this one
She would be the redrum of my pimpin' (Uh-huh)
Knew she would be the one to make me stop
Carin' about other girls on my jock and gettin' them (Oh)

Go with it now, I'ma grow with it now
I'ma go get her, that's how I got her
Don't be mad you can't get one hotta (Uh-huh)

'Cause I got something to say about it (Yeah)
What I'm about to say is straight up
Real talk, no cut I don't play about it (Haha)

I wanna give her the world
And I ain't even tryna lose her (Uh-huh)
I'm addicted to my girl
And the way that she twirls in that little skirt (Uh-huh)
Just for me in the club, in the crib, in the streets
She reps for L B dub, E-N-T
She a nice size with the pretty brown bright eyes
I'm a winner with the right prize (Come on)
I'ma give it to her to the rhythm of a hi-hat
She got a beautiful mind you can't buy that (Nuh-uh)
And the sight of her behind when she walk on by
Make a nigga wanna try that (Yeah)
She got the prettiest smile and she gangsta (Uh-huh)
Keep me from runnin' wild and I thank her
And we can talk about anythin', she got good conversation
My homie, my friend and plus she patient (Oh)


Only thing that keeps me up (Up), when I'm feeling down
I don't know about you, but I gotta keep mines around
'Cause I done looked, I done searched, and it's hard to find
