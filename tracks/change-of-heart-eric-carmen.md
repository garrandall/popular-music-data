I can still recall when we said that our love was forever
All those plans we made for tomorrow that looked so bright
Ah, and I understand all the reasons you gave me for leaving
But that doesn't help when I'm sleeping alone each night

Ah, so if you ever have a change of heart
Just remember it's not too late to start
If you still believe in what love can do

I could find someone more than willing to be your replacement
But there's no one else who can move me the way you do
Ah, so for now, goodbye, but if ever you find you still want me
You just call my name, 'cause I'll always be here for you

Ah, so if you ever have a change of heart
Just remember it's not too late to start
If you still believe in what love can do

Nothing you could ever do would change the things I know
Deep in my heart
So I got to make you understand before I go
Sooner or later, I don't know when
I'm gonna get you back in my arms again

And if you ever have a change of heart
Just remember it's not too late to start
If you still believe in what love can do

So if you ever have a change of heart
Just remember it's not too late to start
If you still believe in what love can do

So if you ever have a change of heart
Just remember it's not too late to start
If you still believe in what love can do
