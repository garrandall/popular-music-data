Don't tell about her arms
I've been there
I know all about her charms
I've been there

I know all too well
That velvet touch of hers
And the way she purrs
And the way she'll say
Okay, I'd love to

Don't tell me about her kiss
I've kissed her
And I'm not ashamed to say
I've missed her

And if she changes her mind
And comes back to me
I know how it will be
Just wonderful for
I've been there, you see

And if she changes her mind
And comes back to me
I know how it will be
Just wonderful for
I've been there, you see
