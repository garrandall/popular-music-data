Get out of that bed
And wash those face and hands
You don't hear me
Get out of that bed
And wash those face and hands
Oh, yeah
You better get in that kitchen
And make some noise
With the pots and pans
Lookie here
I believe to my soul
You're wearing them nylon hose
Lord, have mercy
I believe to my soul
You're wearing them nylon hose
Oh, yeah, and you won't do right
To save your natural soul
And all you wanna do is
Shake, rattle and roll in the morning
Shake, rattle and roll in the evening
Shake, rattle and roll all night long
Shake, rattle and roll
Ha ha, you won't do right
To save your natural soul
Let me tell you something, uh
I'm like a one-eyed cat
Peeping in a seafood store, oh, yeah
And I can look at you and tell
You ain't no child no more
And all you wanna do is
Shake, rattle and roll all night long
Shake, rattle and roll in the morning
Shake, rattle and roll all night long
Shake, rattle and roll
You won't do right
To save your natural soul, oh, yeah
Shake, rattle and roll, baby
Shake, rattle and roll, oh, yeah
Shake, rattle and roll
What you gonna do now
Shake, rattle and roll
What you gonna do now
Shake, rattle and roll
Everybody sing it
Shake, rattle and roll
Oh, one more time
Shake, rattle and roll
Got to, got to do it
Shake, rattle and roll
What you gonna do now
Shake, rattle and roll
Come on, do it
Shake, rattle and roll
All night long
Shake, rattle and roll
Everybody, sing it
Shake, rattle and roll
Oh, one more time
Shake, rattle and roll...
