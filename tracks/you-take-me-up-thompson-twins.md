I work on the front line
I work to survive
I sleep in a fever
So this is my life

I cry in my sleep (Cry boy, Cry boy)
Just makes me weep when I try, how I try
Know what it means to work hard on machines
It's a labour of love so please don't ask me why

Working for reason (Day in, Day out)
Trying to hard (He's trying too hard)
Moving in circles (Too hot, Too hot)
Don't get very far (Don't get very far)

Should I ask you to dance (Dance Boy, Dance Boy)
If I promised romance would you come for the ride
I know what it means to work hard on machines
Will you believe in love, one that lasts for all time

You take me up 
You take me up to the higher ground
You take me up
So high
Now I never want to come back down

I'm gliding these hard time (Day in, Day out)
There's hope in your eyes (Hope in his eyes)
I don't need a religion (Too hot, Too hot)
Cos' this love never dies (Love never dies)

I believe in today (Believe boy, Believe boy)
It's better that way and you work through the night
I know what it means to work hard on machines
It's a labour of love so please don't ask me why

You take me up 
You take me up to the higher ground
You take me up
So high
Now I never want to come back down

I cry in my sleep (Cry boy, Cry boy)
Just makes me weep when I try, how I try
I know what it means to work hard on machines
It's a labour of love so please don't ask me why

You take me up 
You take me up to the higher ground
You take me up
So high
Now I never want to come back down

You take me up 
You take me up to the higher ground
You take me up
So high
Now I never want to come back down
