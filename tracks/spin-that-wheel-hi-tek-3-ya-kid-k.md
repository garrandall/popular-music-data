Hit'em with this
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon

Dope, def, any term is alright
When your DJ plays the K
You will lesten to what the Kid has to say
‘Cause you know it's too damn straight
Can't wait
Gotta get on down before it's too late
And even if so, it would be my friend
Just tell'em to play it again
See, once it starts
To beat your eardrums
It goes way up to your head
Bounces down to your belly and back
If you hunger, you'll be fed
It's all up to the individual
This reaction is typical
Somehow you get to catch up with that beat
Snap them fingers, stomp your feet
Do I love it ? Oh, yeah, do I want it ? Hell, yeah
Do I really need it? Yes, indeed
I smoke the mike like weed

For real, legit, you feel it
I'm talking ‘bout the real deal
I'm a make you feel, yo, DJ spin that wheel
Spin that wheel, spin that wheel
I'm a make you feel, yo, DJ get up and party
I'm here to promote the music
C'mon, bring that beat back

Hi Tek 3 know what's up
They' re hipping the house
So turn it up
C'mon, all you long for
Wrapped up in one pack
When it stops you're gonna put it back
On this trip I'm your hostess
Providing anything you request
Startin' from your hair
To your toenails
Take it from me, it's a must
Come to the Kis so I can bust this
Like it should be done, Ya Kid K is the one
Well, here's a bit of my rhyme
You wanna have a good time
Have a party, yes, indeed
This hype you up like speed

Tunr it up, let it spin, turn it over, let it spin
Turn it up, let it spin, turn it over, let it spin
For real, legit, you feel it
I'm talking ‘bout the real deal
I'm a make you feel, yo, DJ spin that wheel
Spin that wheel, I'm a make you feel
Yo, DJ get up and party
I'm here to promote the music
C'mon, c'mon
Bring that beat back

Turn it up, let it spin
Turn it over, let it spin, yo
Utnr it up, let it spin, turn it over, let it spin
For real, legit, you feel it
I'm talking ‘bout the real feal
I'm a make you feel, yo, DJ spin that wheel

Have a word, any way is OK
When the record starts to play
Legit, you felo, it, yo, DJ spin that wheel
Spin that wheel
I'm a make you feel, yo, DJ get up and party
I'm here to promote the music
C'mon, bring that beat back
C'mon...
