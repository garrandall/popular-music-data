Pull back the cover
Shades, good God
It's a raid

Cut off the lights
And call the law
Cut off the lights
And call the law

Standing over there
The devil's Son In Law

Call the law
Call the law
The devil's son-in-law

Bring on the juice
Bring on the juice
Bring on the juice
Bring on the juice
Make me sweat

Still good
It's still good
Still good
It's still good

Turn over
Turn over
Turn over
Soulful Rover
Take me in the change
Take me in the change
Take me in the change

Honky-tonk women
Is all I need
Honky-tonk women
Is what I want

Fellas, one more time
I wanna give the drummer
Some of this funky soul we got here

You don't have to do no soloing, brother
Just keep what you got
Don't turn it loose
'Cause it's a mother

When I count to four
I want everybody to lay off
Let the drummer go
When I count to four
I want you to come back in

I got to holler
I said it's in my feet
Feels so sweet
It's in my shake, good God
About to work me to death

It's in my shirt
About to work me to death
It's in my shirt
I'm about to blow
I'm about to blow

One, two, three, four
Get it

Ain't it funky
Ain't it funky
Ain't it funky
Ain't it funky
One, two, three, four

The name of this tune is 'The Funky Drummer'
The funky drummer
The funky drummer
The funky drummer
The funky drummer
The funky drummer
