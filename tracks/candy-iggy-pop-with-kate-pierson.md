It's a rainy afternoon in 1990
The big city
Geez, it's been 20 years
Candy, you were so fine

Beautiful, beautiful girl from the North
You burned my heart with a flickering torch
I had a dream that no one else could see
You gave me love for free

Candy, Candy, Candy
I can't let you go
All my life you're haunting me
I loved you so

Candy, Candy, Candy
I can't let you go
Life is crazy
Candy baby

Yeah, well it hurt me real bad when you left
I'm glad you got out but, but I miss you
I've had a hole in my heart for so long
I've learned to fake it and just smile along

Down on the street
Those men are all the same
I need a love, not games
Not games

Candy, Candy, Candy
I can't let you go
All my life you're haunting me
I loved you so

Candy, Candy, Candy
I can't let you go
Life is crazy
I know baby
Candy baby

Oh oh oh oh, Candy, Candy, Candy
I can't let you go
All my life you're haunting me
I loved you so

Candy, Candy, Candy
Life is crazy
Candy baby
Candy baby
Candy, Candy

Candy, Candy, Candy
I can't let you go
All my life I'm waiting for you, loved you so

Candy, Candy, Candy
I can't let you go
