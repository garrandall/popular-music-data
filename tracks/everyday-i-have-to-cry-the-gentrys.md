(CHORUS)
Every day I have to cry some
Every day I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
Every day I have to cry

There was a little girl
I'd planned to marry
This was my love
I didn't want to share it

I thought that love would
Make my life bright and sunny
She said she couldn't love me
Cause I didn't have no money

So
(CHORUS)

Had me a girl
Yes, I really loved her
Every night when I
Was thinking of her

But you can't
Mix love with money
Cause if you do
It's gonna hurt somebody

So
(CHORUS)

Oh, I know that
I'm just a poor man
But is it wrong to love
Cause I'm not a rich man

But every time you
Mix love with money
Every time, it hurts somebody

(CHORUS) 2X to fade
