You don't fool me with your tinted eyes and make up
The firebird hides in shadow when you wake up
Your golden hair is black
Your jeans are tight but your hide is slack
Try it on the company but you don't fool me

Well I'd rather be a man than play my role like you do
I'd rather be a man than sin my soul like you do
I'd rather be a man than slave the way that you do
I'd rather be a man cause a man don't crawl like you do

You don't fool me with your easy lies and fables
You won't see me in ten buck furs and sables
You sparkle like a snake
The wine is real but the glass is fake
Blame it on the apple tree but you don't fool me

Well I'd rather be a man than play my role like you do
I'd rather be a man than sin my soul like you do
I'd rather be a man than slave the way that you do
I'd rather be a man cause a man don't crawl like you do

Your golden hair is black
Your jeans are tight but your hide is slack
Try it on the company but you don't fool me

Well I'd rather be a man than play my role like you do
I'd rather be a man than sin my soul like you do
I'd rather be a man than slave the way that you do
I'd rather be a man cause a man don't crawl like you do

I'd rather be a man cause a man don't crawl like you

I'd rather be a man cause I wouldn't wanna be like you
