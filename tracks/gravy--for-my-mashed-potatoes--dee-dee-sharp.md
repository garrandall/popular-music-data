Come on baby I need gravy
Give me, give me
Give me, give me gravy tonight
I know you dance the mashed potato fine
But that don?t show me that you?re really mine
Once start dancin? we?re now romancin?
So put that sucker on extra on the line
Gravy
On my mashed potatoes, give me
Gravy
Come and treat me right
Gravy
You?re the greatest, so
Give me, give me
Give me, give me gravy tonight
I think it?s twisted but I want some more
There?s something missing now we?re on the floor
Come on baby I want some gravy
A little kiss is what I?m waiting for
Gravy
On my mashed potatoes, give me
Gravy
Come and treat me right
Gravy
You?re the greatest
Give me, give me
Give me, give me gravy tonight
Work out baby work out
All that huggin? and kissin? is why
I?ve got to have something else
Now when the mashed potato is finally through
There?s lots of groovy, gravy things to do
Lots of lovin?, kissin?, huggin?
I wanna ride that gravy train with you
Gravy
On my mashed potatoes, give me
Gravy
Come and treat me right
Gravy
Hey baby you?re the greatest
Give me, give me
Give me, give me gravy tonight, give me
Gravy
On my mashed potatoes, give me
Gravy
Come and treat me right
Gravy
Oh baby come on honey
Give me, give me
Give me, give me gravy tonight
Gravy
On my mashed potatoes, give me
Gravy
All that huggin? and kissin? is great
That I like
Yeah, what about gravy on it
