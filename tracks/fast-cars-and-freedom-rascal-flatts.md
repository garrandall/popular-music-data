Starin' at you takin' off your makeup
Wondering why you even put it on
I know you think you do but baby you don't need it
Wish that you could see what I see it when it's gone
I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder


Wait, baby don't move, right there it is
T-shirt hanging off a Dogwood Branch
That river was cold but we gave love a chance
Yeah, yeah for me
You don't look a day over Fast Cars and Freedom
That sunset river bank first time feeling

Yeah, smile and shake your head as if you don't believe me
I'll just sit right here and let you take me back
I'm on that gravel road, look at me
On my way to pick you up you're standing on the front porch
Looking just like that remember that

I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder



I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder
You don't look a day over Fast Cars and Freedom
That sunset river bank first time feeling
