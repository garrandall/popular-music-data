All night long, one night
I could not sleep for ringing in my ear
A melody began to sing
For at first
The words I could not make out clear
Then smog fields lifted away (smog fields)
And this is what I heard them say


It said, "Without love (without love), there's nothing you can do"
Yes, it did
It said, "Without love (without love), you're not even you"


All night long, He spoke to me - the words of wisdom rang
Beneath His sweet, soft melody
Said, "Don't you know (Don't you know), yeah (child?)
That a rich man can be poor if wealth is all he has?"
(Mm, mm, mm.) Hey! I know


Yeah, without love (without love), there's nothing you can do
(Do, do, do!) Do you know?
Without love (without love), you're not even you
Can't you hear me talking to you? (Can't you hear us talking to you?)
Without love, ha, there's so much you can do
(Without love) Yes, it is
Hey, without love (Without love)
Ooh, you're not even you (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, yeah
Without love (Without love), there's really so much you can do
(Without love) Yes, it is (Without love)
Without love (Without love), you're not even you
Everybody sing now
Without love (without love), there's so much you can do
(Without love) Yes, it is, yes, it is! (Without love)
Without love (without love), you're not even you
Sing it, sing it, one more time
Without love (without love), there's so much you can do
(Without love) Without love (Without love)
(Without love) Do you know you're not even you?
Hey, hey, without love (Without love), just so much you can do
