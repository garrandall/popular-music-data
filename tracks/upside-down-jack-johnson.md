Who's to say what's impossible?
Well they forgot, this world keeps spinning
And with each new day
I can feel a change in everything

And as the surface breaks, reflections fade
But in some ways, they remain the same
And as my mind begins to spread its wings
There's no stopping curiosity


I wanna turn the whole thing upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
I don't want this feeling to go away


Who's to say I can't do everything?
Well I can try
And as I roll along I begin to find
Things aren't always just what they seem


I wanna turn the whole thing upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
This world keeps spinning


And there's no time to waste
Will it all keep spinning, spinning round and round and
Upside down
Who's to say what's impossible and can't be found?
I don't want this feeling to go away


Please don't go away
Please don't go away
Please don't go away
Is this how it's supposed to be?
Is this how it's supposed to be?
