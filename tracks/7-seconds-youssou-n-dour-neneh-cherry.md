Boul ma sene, boul ma guiss madi re nga fokni mane
Khamouma li neka thi sama souf ak thi guinaw
Beugouma kouma khol oaldine yaw li neka si yaw
Mo ne si man, li ne si mane moye dilene diapale

Roughneck and rudeness
We should be using
On the ones who practice wicked charms
For the sword and the stone
Bad to the bone
Battle is not over
Even when it's won

And when a child is born
Into this world
It has no concept
Of the tone the skin is living in

It's not a second
Seven seconds away
Just as long as I stay
I'll be waiting
It's not a second
Seven seconds away
Just as long as I stay
I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting

J'assume les raisons qui nous poussent de changer tout
J'aimerais qu'on oublie leur couleur pour qu'ils esperent
Beaucoup de sentiments de races qui font qu'ils desesperent
Je veux les deux mains ouvertes
Des amis pour parler de leur peine, de leur joie
Pour qu'ils leur filent des infos qui ne divisent pas
Changer

Seven seconds away
Just as long as I stay
I'll be waiting
It's not a second
Seven seconds away
Just as long as I stay
I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting

And when a child is born
Into this world
It has no concept
Of the tone the skin it's living in

And there's a million voices
And there's a million voices
To tell you what you should be thinking
So you better sober up for just a second

We're seven seconds away
Just as long as I stay
I'll be waiting
It's not a second
We're seven seconds away
For just as long as I stay
I'll be waiting
It's not a second
Seven seconds away
Just as long as I stay
I'll be waiting
