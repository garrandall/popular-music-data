Geraldine (Geraldine, Geraldine, Geraldine)
Geraldine (Geraldine, Geraldine, Geraldine)
Geraldine (Geraldine, Geraldine, Geraldine)
Geraldine (Geraldine, Geraldine, Geraldine)
(Oh) Cutest girl I've ever seen
Geraldine (Geraldine, Geraldine, Geraldine)
Ah, Geraldine (Geraldine, Geraldine, Geraldine)
Geraldine (Geraldine, Geraldine, Geraldine)
Geraldine (Geraldine, Geraldine, Geraldine)
Geraldine (Geraldine, Geraldine, Geraldine)
(Oh) Cutest girl I've ever seen
Geraldine (Geraldine, Geraldine, Geraldine)
She's got big blue eyes, old blue jeans
She's the queen of all the teens
Geraldine (Geraldine, Geraldine, Geraldine)
Geraldine (Geraldine, Geraldine, Geraldine)
(Oh) Cutest girl I've ever seen
Geraldine (Geraldine, Geraldine, Geraldine)
Ah, Geraldine (Geraldine, Geraldine, Geraldine)
Geraldine (Geraldine, Geraldine, Geraldine)
Geraldine (Geraldine, Geraldine, Geraldine)
Geraldine (Geraldine, Geraldine, Geraldine)
(Oh) Cutest girl I've ever seen
Geraldine (Geraldine, Geraldine, Geraldine)
Now she plays and plays, with all the boys
Like they was a bunch of toys
Geraldine (Geraldine, Geraldine, Geraldine)
Geraldine (Geraldine, Geraldine, Geraldine)
(Oh) Cutest girl I've ever seen
Geraldine (Geraldine, Geraldine, Geraldine)
Well, she's always found hangin' around
With all the boys that's in this town
Geraldine (Geraldine, Geraldine, Geraldine)
Geraldine (Geraldine, Geraldine, Geraldine)
(Oh) Cutest girl I've ever seen
Geraldine (Geraldine, Geraldine, Geraldine)
