Someone really loves you
Guess who, guess who
Someone really cares
Guess who (guess who)

Open your heart
Surely then you'll see
That someone who cares is me

Someone weeps eternally (guess who)
Someone who wants your love
Desperately (guess who)

Open your heart
Surely then you'll see
That someone who cares is me

(Someone really loves you) guess who
(Someone really cares)
Guess, guess who

Open up your heart
Surely then you'll see
That someone who cares is me
