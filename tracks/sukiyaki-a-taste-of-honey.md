It's all because of you I'm feelin' sad and blue
You went away, now my life is just a rainy day
I love you so, how much you'll never know
You've gone away and left me lonely
Untouchable memories seem to keep haunting me
Of love so true, that once turned all my gray skies blue
But you disappeared, now my eyes are filled with tears
I'm wishin' you were here with me
Soft with love are my thoughts of you
Now that you're gone, oh, I don't know what to do


If only you were here, you'd wash away my tears
The sun would shine, and once again you'd be mine, all mine
But in reality, you and I will never be
'Cause you took your love away from me, oh
If only you were here, you'd wash away my tears
The sun would shine, and once again you'd be mine, all mine
But in reality, you and I will never be
'Cause you took your love away from me
Oh, baby, you took your love away from
Me
