Here's a song I love to sing
It's about the man that wears my ring
And even though he's tempted, he knows
I'll make sure that he gets everything

'Cos when he's cold, he knows I'm warm
And I warm him in my arms
And when he's sad, oh, I make him glad
And I'm his shelter from the storm

I'm his song when he feels like singing
And I swing when he feels like swinging
I don't know what I do that's right
But it makes him come home at night

And when he's home
I make sure he's never alone
And that's why
I keep singing my song

And when he's home
I make sure he's never alone
And that's why
I keep singing my song
