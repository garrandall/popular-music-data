Baby here I am, I'm the man on the scene
I can give you what you want
But you got to come home with me

I've got some good old lovin'
And I got some more in store
When I get through throwin' it on you
You got to come back for more

Boys and things that come by the dozen
That ain't nothin' but drug store lovin'
Hey little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause, mama, I'm sure hard to handle, now, yessir'am

Action speaks louder than words
And I'm a man of great experience
I know you got another man
But I can love you better than him

Take my hand, don't be afraid
I'm gonna prove every word I say
I'm advertisin' love for free
So you can place your ad with me

Boys come along a dime by the dozen
That ain't nothin' but drug store lovin'
Hey little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause, mama, I'm sure hard to handle, now, yessir'am

Oh, yes, I am
Oh, baby
Ohhh

Baby, here I am
I'm the man on your scene
I can give you what you want
But you got to come home with me

I've got some good old lovin'
And I got some more in store
When I get through throwin' it on you
You got to come back for more

Boys and things that come by the dozen
That ain't nothin' but drug store lovin'
Hey little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause, mama, I'm sure hard to handle, now, yessir'am

Oh, yes, I am
Oh
Won't you take it out, take it out, take it out

Boys and things that come by the dozen
That ain't nothin' but drug store lovin'
Oh, hey little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause, mama, I'm sure hard to handle, now, yessir'am

Oh, baby, oh

Oh, baby, oh
