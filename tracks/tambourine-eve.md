You gotta shake ya ass

Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go an'

Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go an'

Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'

Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'

E.V.E. come through in a Maserat
Throwin' it big like I live in the Taj Mahal
Talk shit, I don't get into blah-zy blah
That's why they lovin' uh

That's real when the chicks that they talked about
"Goddamn" is the words that come out they mouth
She look good, always, without a doubt
Ask for her, yes she back and cakin' out

Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'

Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'

They be watchin' while we wiggle around, look at 'em droolin'
Niggas ain't used to this sound, I keep 'em movin'
All my ladies put your hands in the air, it's alright now
We gon' keep you up on your feet the whole night now
Pop them bottles, yeah drink that up man
Got you feelin' crazy, well that was the plan
They was waitin' for me, wasn't ready for this
He got the game sewed up, no I'm talkin' 'bout Swiss
Oh yeah, I know you wanna fight it, but why would you try?
We got 'em shakin' everything from the hood to Dubai
Yeah, we do it big man, why would we lie? Come on
One, two, three, everybody!

Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'

Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'

Get low, get low, then pick up, pick up
Get your hands in the air, it's a stick-up, stick-up
Shake your tambourines, move it quicker, quicker
Yeah, I'm shakin' down the town, get the picture, picture?

Movin' on the floor, gotta love that
How she keep it goin' on, gotta love that
To the beat, like a pro, know you love that
She can shake it to the floor, gotta love that

Get ya ass on the dance floor, dance on the dance floor
Move 'em out the way if they ain't doin' it how you want yours
You ain't got to ask, keep givin' more
Don't need my permission, y'all heard, what you waitin' for?

Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'

Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'

Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
Shake your tambourine go and get yourself a whistlin'
