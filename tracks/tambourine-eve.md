You gotta shake your ass

Shake your tambourine
Go and get yourself a whistling 


OK
OK
E.V.E.
E.V.E
I go by the name of Swizz Beatz the monster
We're gonna get this party started
No surface
Let's go!


Shake you tambourine go and get yourself a whistling
Shake you tambourine go and get yourself a whistling
Shake you tambourine go and get yourself a whistling
(ladies!!)
Shake you tambourine go and get yourself a whistling
(ladies!!)
Shake you tambourine go and get you self a whistling
Shake you tambourine go and get you self a whistling
Shake you tambourine go and get you self a whistling
Shake you tambourine go and get you self a whistling


E.v.e. come through with a Maseratti
On it big like I'm living in taj mahal
Talk shit I don't get and that blah dee blah
Haa... thatâs what they lovin now
That's real and the chicks that they talk about
God damn is the words that come out they mouth
She looks good always without a doubt
Ask for her is she back and caking out
Come on


Shake you tambourine go and get yourself a whistling
Shake you tambourine go and get yourself a whistling
Shake you tambourine go and get yourself a whistling
Shake you tambourine go and get yourself a whistling
Shake you tambourine go and get yourself a whistling
Shake you tambourine go and get yourself a whistling
Shake you tambourine go and get yourself a whistling
Shake you tambourine go and get yourself a whistling


They be watching while we wiggle around
Look at 'em drooling
Niggas ain't use to the sound I keep 'em moving
All my ladies put you hands in the air it's all right now
We're gonna put you up on your feet the whole night now
Pop them bottles and drink that up man
Got you feeling crazy well that was the plan
They was waiting for me watching ready for this
He got the game soled up now he talking 'bout swizz
Yeah I know you gotta fight it but why would you try?
We got shaking everything from the hood to Dubai
Yeah we do it big man why would we lie
Come on 1, 2, 3, everybody




Yo yo
Get low get low then pick up pick up
Get you hands in the air it's a stick up stick up
Shake you tambourines move it quicker quicker
Yeah I'm shaking down the town get the picture, pitcher
Humping on the floor gotta love that
How she keeps it going on gotta love that
To the beat like a pro know you love that
She can shake it to the floor gotta love that
Get you ass on the dance floor
Dance on the dance floor
Move 'em out the way if they ain't doing it how you want yours
you ain't got to ask keep moving on
Don't get my permission you heard what you waiting for?


Shake you tambourine go and get yourself a whistling
(get it up!!)
Shake you tambourine go and get yourself a whistling
(get it up!!)
Shake you tambourine go and get yourself a whistling
(get it up!!)
Shake you tambourine go and get yourself a whistling

(Now shake shake shake shake shake shake shake shake shake shake shake shake shake shake shake shake shake shake)
