Who do you
Who do you belong to?
My point of view
Is that I think you're hot

If we talked
What words could I describe
There's no dictionary book
To explain how you look

I think you're (sexy, sexy, sexy)
Cold blooded
What more can I say (sexy, sexy, sexy)
Cold blooded

The way you walk (Sexy)
The way you talk, baby (cold blooded)
Oh, you're too cold for me (Sexy)
Freaky baby

Who are you (You look like a movie star)
What's your name and number?
Is it true?
That you think I'm hot (Think I'm hot)

If we try
To get to know each other
You might find
You couldn't trade me for another

Because I think you're (sexy, sexy, sexy)
Cold blooded
In my dictionary (sexy, sexy, sexy)
Cold blooded

What more can I say (sexy, sexy, sexy)
Cold blooded
Holy smokes and gee whiz (sexy, sexy, sexy)
Cold blooded (Freeze!)

Who do you
Who do you belong to?
My point of view
Is that I think you're hot (Hot)

If we try
To get to know each other
You might find
You couldn't trade me for another

I think you're (so sexy, sexy, sexy)
Cold blooded
In my dictionary, (sexy, sexy, sexy)
Cold blooded
Holy smokes and gee whiz, (sexy, sexy, sexy)
Cold blooded
