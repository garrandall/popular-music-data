Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way, I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be all night, I'll be all day, I'll be all day
Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way, I'll be on the way
You can meet me in five, I'll be all night, I'll be all day, I'll be all day

Yeah, this the type of thing that you been waiting all year for
Back in town for a minute if you with it
Got a lot of time, I just need somewhere to spend it
I just see a button and the top go missing
I kept the slip so you know it's not rented, yeah, oh, oh
What you wanna do?
Worried 'bout your friends, they saw you this afternoon

Girl you got me like
I gave her everything
She took my heart and left me lonely
I think broken heart's contagious
I won't fix, I'd rather weep
I'm lost then I'm found
But it's torture bein' in love
I love it when you're around me
But I really hate when you leave

Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go
You decide if you're ever gonna let me know
Suicide if you ever try to let go
I'm sad, I know, yeah, I'm sad, I know
Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go
You decide if you're ever gonna let me know
Suicide if you ever try to let go
I'm sad, I know, yeah, I'm sad, I know

'Cause when you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's going to talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who's going to take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

Put it in drive, I'll be outside, I'll be on the way
I know, yeah, I'm sad, I know
Put it in drive, I'll be outside
'Cause we belong together
