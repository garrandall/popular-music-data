Oh yeah yeah yeah

I'm girl scouting
Just scouting around looking for somebody to love me
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm girl scouting
Just scouting around looking for somebody to love me
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

I need somebody to love
I need the kind of love that I can depend on
Girl I've been looking here and there
Searching everywhere
Oh I just gotta find
A love that I can share

Oh yeah

Oh yeah yeah yeah
I'm girl scouting
Just scouting around looking for somebody to love me
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

I need somebody to give all my loving
I need someone when I feel sad and blue
But I'm looking for the right girl
She's got to come along
And I'm gonna love her with a love so strong

Oh yeah
I'm girl scouting
Oh yeah yeah yeah
I'm girl scouting
Just scouting around looking for somebody to love me
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

Don't you know I'm girl scouting
Girl scouting

Just scouting around looking for somebody to love me
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm girl scouting
Just scouting around looking for somebody to love me
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

I'm girl scouting
