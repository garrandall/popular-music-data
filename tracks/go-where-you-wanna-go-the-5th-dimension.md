You gotta go where you wanna go
Do what you wanna do
With whomever you wanna do it with

Baby, you gotta go where you wanna go
Do what you wanna do
With whomever you wanna do it with

You don't understand
That a girl like me can love just one man
Three thousand miles, that's how far you'll go
And you said to me, "Please, don't follow"

You gotta go where you wanna go
Do what you wanna do
With whomever you wanna do it with

You gotta go where you wanna go
Do what you wanna do
With whomever you wanna do it with

You don't understand
That a girl like me can love just one man
You've been gone a week and I tried so hard
Not to be the cryin' kind, not to be the girl you left behind

You gotta go where you wanna go
Do what you wanna do
With whomever you wanna do it with
