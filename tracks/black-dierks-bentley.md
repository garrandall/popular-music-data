The moon, outside, too bright
Those blinds, yeah, lets just keep them closed
You know, my hands they know where to go, to find your fingertips
Trace them back to your lips, take you on a trip
Flip that switch

Make my world go black, hit me like a heart attack, knock me flat on my back, yeah
Just keep doing that, that thing you're doing there, brush me with your hair
I swear I don't know how long that I can last
Make my world go black, black
Make my world go black, black

Like your dress on the floor
Yeah, the one you don't need anymore,
Black like a sky, with no stars, just find me and fall into my arms

Make my world go black, hit me like a heart attack, knock me flat on my back, yeah
Just keep doing that, that thing you're doing there, brush me with your hair
I swear I don't know how long that I can last
Make my world go black
Make my world go black

I don't wanna see a thing
Baby, I just wanna feel your touch, feel your rush
I don't wanna see a thing, I just wanna feel your love

Make my world go black, hit me like a heart attack, knock me flat on my back, yeah
Just keep doing that, that thing you're doing there, brush me with your hair
I swear I don't know how long that I can last
Make my world go black
Make my world go black

Make my world go black
I don't wanna see a thing
I just wanna feel your touch, feel your rush

Black, black...
