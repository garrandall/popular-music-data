Only love can make me do what I'm doin'.
Only love can make me do what I'm doin', now.
Only love can make me do what I'm doin'.
Only love, only love.

Anybody can sing a love song,
Love doesn't know any right or wrong, no, no,
Open your heart and sing along,
Sing it:

Only love can make me do what I'm doin'.
Only love can make me do what I'm doin', now.
Only love can make me do what I'm doin'.
Only love, only love.

Well, you don't have to be afraid to say "I love you",
'Cause somebody sometime somewhere is gonna love you,
I know there's proof of it, because I do,
And I'm singin':

Only love can make me do what I'm doin'.
Only love can make me do what I'm doin', now.
Only love can make me do what I'm doin'.
Only love, only love.

There's been a lot of folks singin' for a long, long time,
There'll be a lot of folks singin' for the same kind,
All of them sayin', "Let your love shine".
You know I hear all of the sayin' "Let your love shine",
And I'm singin':

Only love can make me do what I'm doin'.
Only love can make me do what I'm doin', now.
Only love can make me do what I'm doin'.
Only love, only love.
