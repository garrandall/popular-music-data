Watch out, oh girls, you know we've got to
Watch out, girls, you know we've got to
Watch out, here comes that playboy
Watch out, here comes that playboy
Watch out, here comes that playboy

Playboy, get away from my door
I heard about the lovers you had before
You took their love for a game of joy
And tossed their hearts around
As though it was a toy, playboy

Well, playboy, find yourself some other toy
'Cause this is one heart you won't destroy
'Cause I can't stand for what you're puttin' down
Foolin' around with every girl in town, playboy

Well, you ain't sayin' nothin' in my book
'Cause this is one fish, you'll never ever hook
You left the others standin' with their hearts in pain
And now you're comin' 'round tryin' to do me the same

So playboy, I've seen your kind
Winnin' every girl with that same old line
So playboy, stay away from my door
I know about the lovers you had before, playboy

Whoa, you know you've got to watch out
Here comes that playboy
Yes, you know you've got to watch out
Here comes that playboy
Oh, you've got to watch out
Here comes that playboy
You better, watch out, you better, watch out

Well, you ain't sayin' nothin' in my book
'Cause this is one fish, you'll never ever hook
You left the others standin' with their hearts in pain
And now you're comin' round tryin' to do me the same

So playboy, I've seen your kind
Winnin' every girl with that same old line
So playboy, stay away from my door
I know about the lovers you had before, playboy

Whoa, you know you better watch out
Here comes that playboy
Watch out here comes that playboy
Watch for the playboy, he's bringin' you false joy
Watch out, here comes that playboy
Watch out, here comes that playboy
Watch out, here comes that playboy
