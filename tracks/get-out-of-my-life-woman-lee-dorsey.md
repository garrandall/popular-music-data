Get out of my life, woman, you don't love me no more
Get out of my life, woman, you don't love me no more
Get out of my life, you don't no love me no more

Get out of my eyes, teardrops, I've got to see my way around
Get out of my eyes, teardrops, I've got to see my way around
Get out of my life, I've heartaches by the pound

Get off my ladder, woman, I've got to climb up to the top
Get off my ladder, woman, I've got to climb up to the top
The reason why I'd want you to get off, ain't nothing gonna make me drop

Get out of my life, woman, you don't love me no more
Get out of my life, babe, you don't love me no more
Get out of my life, you don't no love me no more
