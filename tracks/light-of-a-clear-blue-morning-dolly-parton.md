It's been a long dark night
And I've been a waitin' for the morning
It's been a long hard fight
But I can see a brand new day a dawning
And I've been looking for the sunshine
'Cause I ain't seen it in so long
Everything's gonna work out just fine
Everything's gonna be all right
That's been all wrong

'Cause I can see the light of a clear blue morning
I can see the light of a brand new day
I can see the light of a clear blue morning
Everything's gonna be all right
It's gonna be okay

It's been a long long time
Since I've known the taste of freedom
And those clinging vines
That had me bound, well I don't need 'em

I've been like a captured eagle
You know an eagle's born to fly
And now that I have won my freedom
Like an eagle I'm eager for the sky

'Cause I can see the light of a clear blue morning
I can see the light of a brand new day
I can see the light of a clear blue morning
Everything's gonna be all right
It's gonna be okay

'Cause I can see the light of a clear blue morning
I can see the light of a brand new day
I can see the light of a clear blue morning
Everything's gonna be all right
It's gonna be okay
Everything's gonna be all right
It's gonna be okay
