When you're standing on the edge of nowhere
There's only one way up, so your heart's got to go there
Through the darkest nights to see the light shine bright
When heroes fall in love or war they live forever
'Cause this is a song for the lonely
Can you hear me tonight?
For the broken hearted, battle scarred
I'll be by your side
And this is a song for the lonely
When your dreams won't come true
Can you hear this prayer?
'Cause someone's there for you
Well love don't need a reason
She can pick you up or leave you bleeding
I've seen a strong man cry, I know the reason why
We all forgive, we all forget, we just keep believing
'Cause this is a song for the lonely
Can you hear me tonight?
For the broken hearted, battle scarred
I'll be by your side
And this is a song for the lonely
When your dreams won't come true
Can you hear this prayer?
'Cause someone's there for you
(Don't give up)
So let it find you
(Just hold on)
Wherever you may go
()
I'm right beside you
You don't have to look no more
You don't have to look no more, oh no
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
This is a song, a song for the lonely
And that's not you only
Through the darkest night
You're gonna see the light
This a song for the lonely
When your dreams won't come true
Can you hear this prayer?
'Cause there's someone there
Can you hear this prayer?
'Cause someone's there
Can you hear this prayer?
'Cause someone's there for you
