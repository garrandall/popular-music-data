At nine years old and sweet as she can be
All dressed up like a downtown Christmas tree
Dancing and humming a rock-roll melody
Shes the daughter of a well-respected man
Who taught her how to judge and understand
Since she became a rock-roll music fan


Sweet little rock and roller
Sweet little rock and roller
Her daddy don't have to scold her
Her partner can't hardly hold her
She never gets any older
Sweet little rock and roller

Should've seen her eyes when the band began to play
And the famous singers sang and barred away
When the stars performed, she screamed and yelled, "Hooray!"
Ten thousand eyes were watching them leave the floor
Five thousand tongues were screaming, "More! More!"
And about fifteen hundred waitin outside the door


Sweet little rock and roller
Sweet little rock and roller
Sweet little rock and roller
Sweet little rock and roller
Sweet little rock and roller
