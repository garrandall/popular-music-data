Now ten years old and as sweet as she can be
All dressed up like a downtown Christmas tree
Dancin' an' hummin' a rock 'n' roll melody

She's the daughter of a well respected man
Who taught her how to jerk and understand
Since she became a rock 'n' roll music fan

Sweet little rock 'n' roller, sweet little rock 'n' roller
Her daddy doesn't have to scold her, her... can't hardly hold her
And can't she never gets any older, sweet little rock 'n' roller

Should-a seen her eyes when the band began to play
And the famous singer bowed away
The stars were gone, she screamed and yelled for rain

Ten thousand eyes were watchin' them leave the floor
Five thousand tongues were screamin': 'More and more!'
And 'bout fifteen hundred waitin' outside the door

Sweet little rock 'n' roller, sweet little rock 'n' roller
Her daddy doesn't have to scold her, her... can't hardly hold her
And can't she never gets any older, sweet little rock 'n' roller

Sweet little rock 'n' roller, sweet little rock 'n' roller
Sweet little rock 'n' roller, sweet little rock 'n' roller
Sweet little rock 'n' roller
