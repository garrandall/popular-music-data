It's the ride y'all, come on we're goin on a ride
It's the ride y'all, come on I know you wanna ride
It's the ride y'all, come on we're goin on a ride
It's the ride y'lla, it's the I.N.C. Ride



R to the I, D to the E, check out how we the I.N.C.
Get more Biz than Markie as I spark thee
Mike like lightnin, that's frightenin, I'm hypin
Niggas up, cuz they don't know the score
Oh here comes the roar, knock on your door
I wonder who it is and who could it be
Ain't nobody but the I.N.C.
Wit mo' Soul than the Train I'm a reign
With 808 beats that hit big like Kane
Daddy, caddy, Coup DeVille, chill
Jump in my ride and slide down the hill
To see if we catch dem kids talking that was talkin that mess
And tryin to impress, never the lesstheless, yo
I gotta let em know they can't find us, so get behind us
Cause we cruise in the I.N.C. Ride



(Incorpate the I-N-C into a flow)
From the East side, to the West side
From the North side, to the South side
From the East side, to the West side
From the North side, to the South side



Ain't nobody but the A (o-kay)
And I'm not the one you wanna play (don't play)
I'm flat like a cap on a can of flat black
Let me snap back break a nigee down with my rap
Cause this is how we do
Who is the crew coming through with the brand new
As we flex and get fly, you cry
The roof is on fire but my name ain't Left Eye
Punks be all up on it like a Charlotte Hornet
But they full of Chicago Bull-shit cuz they don't want it
Oh, don't let me sing, I'm peaking
I'm freakin, get in that ass like a G-String
And that you don't need
We'll be blowin up like that movie Speed indeed you're on a ride



(Incorpate the I-N-C into a flow)
From the East side, to the West side
From the North side, to the South side
From the East side, to the West side
From the North side, to the South side

You're in a Lexus, or Blazer
You're in a Beamer, or a Benz
You're in a Corvette, or a Nissan
You're in a Sidekick, wit your friends
You're in a Caddy, a Landcruiser
A Range Rover, a Mustang
You're in a Burban with ten woofers
Then your system, it must bang

From the East, to the West
From the North, to the South
From the East, to the West
From the North, to the South
From the East, to the West
From the North, to the South
From the East, to the West
From the North, to the South
The I.N.C. Ride
