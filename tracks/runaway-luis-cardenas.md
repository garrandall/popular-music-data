As I walk along, I wonder
What went wrong with our love
A love that was so strong

And as I still walk on, I think of
The things we've done together
When our hearts were young

I'm a walking in the rain
Tears are falling
And I feel the pain
Wishing you were here by me
To end this misery, I wonder
I wa-wa-wa-wa-wonder why
Oh, oh, why, why, why, why
Why she ran away
And I wonder
Where she will stay
My little runaway
Run, run, run, run, runaway

Run, run, run, run, runaway
Run, run, run, run, runaway
Run, run, run, run, runaway...
