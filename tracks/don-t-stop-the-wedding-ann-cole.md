I've heard your plea
To stop the wedding
And in all due respect
Let us hear from the bride

Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't stop the wedding

Let us be happy too
You just can't face the facts, baby
That it's happy here without you

You know you don't
Really, really love him
No, no, no, no, you're
Just defending selfish pride

When you had him
You didn't want him
And now you're sorry
Deep down inside

You left him, you left him
Here with somebody new, baby
You hurt him so bad
But if you'll let me
I'll give him the love
He never, never had

So don't do it (don't do it)
Don't do it (don't do it)
Don't stop the wedding
(Don't do it) no, no, no
(Don't do it)
Don't break two hearts
(Don't break two hearts)

Listen to me
Listen to me, baby

I said don't do it (don't you do it)
Don't do it (don't you do it)
Don't stop the wedding
(Don't you do it) no, no, no
(Don't you do it)
Don't break two hearts
(Don't break two hearts)

No, no, no, no, no...
Don't do it, don't do it
(Don't you do it)
Don't do it
Don't stop the wedding...
