You walked in my life, with and angels smile
How could I have known, the hunger locked inside
We can start a fire, but we can't control the flame
Now I just can't wait, to feel that heat again
And in the middle of the night you cry . . 

Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me
I got a burning heart
Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me

Just seems like yesterday, I was running alone
I turned my back on love, but baby I was wrong
Do I miss your touch, do I tell myself a lie
Can't get enough, when I'm lying by your side
And in the middle of the night I cry . 

Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me
I got a burning heart
Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me

Shadows moving on the wall
Slowly we begin to fall
Lying in a pool of sweat
Another night I can't forget

Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me
I got a burning heart
Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me
