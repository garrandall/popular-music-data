It was one of those great stories
That you can't put down at night
The hero knew what he had to do
And he wasn't afraid to fight

The villain goes to jail
While the hero goes free
I wish it were that simple for me

And the reason that she loved him
Was the reason I loved him too
And he never wondered
What was right or wrong
He just knew, he just knew

Shadow and shape
Mix together at dawn
But by the time you catch them
Simplicity's gone

So we sort through the pieces
My friends and I
Searching through the darkness
To find the breaks in the sky

And the reason that she loved him
Was the reason I loved him too
And he never wondered
What was right or wrong
He just knew, he just knew

And we wonder, yes, we wonder
How do you make sense of this
When the hero kills the maiden
With his kiss, with his kiss

Well, it was one of those great stories
That you can't put down at night
The hero knew what he had to do
And he wasn't afraid to fight

The villain goes to jail
While the hero goes free
I wish it were that simple for me
Were that simple for me
