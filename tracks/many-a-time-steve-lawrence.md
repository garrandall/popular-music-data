Many a time
Sad tears were in my eyes
Many a time
You told me many lies
My love for you
Should have ended long long ago
But there was hope in my heart
Because I loved you so

Many a time
You filled my heart with pain
Just like a cloud
You filled our love with rain
And if you can't be true
Though you may try and try
Then let's be friends when we say
Goodbye

Sad tears were in my eyes
You told me many lies
And if you can't be true
Though you may try and try
Then let's be friends when we say
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
