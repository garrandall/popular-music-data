He loved to bring her flowers
But she, she never understood, oh, no
He never took advantage of her
But she, she always wished he would

And while all the love builds up
Deep inside of them
Their hearts afire
Burn with one desire

Oh, sometimes they pulled away
But they keep coming back
Crazy how lovers act
Opposites do attract

One day, you know he
He finally made his mind up, yeah
That he, he waited
Waited much too long

And then he left home to
Find the girl and rescue her
And their hearts afire
Burn with one desire

Oh, sometimes they pulled away
But they keep coming back
Crazy how lovers act
Opposites do attract

Oh, sometimes they pulled away
But they keep coming back
Crazy how lovers act
Opposites do attract

Oh, sometimes they pulled away
But they keep coming back
Crazy how lovers act
Opposites do attract

Oh, sometimes they pulled away
But they keep coming back
Crazy how lovers act
Opposites do attract
