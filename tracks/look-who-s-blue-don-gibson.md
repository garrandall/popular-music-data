(Look, look, look-a, look who's blue)
(Look, look, look-a, look who's blue)
Please, please, have pity on me
Oh, can't you see that I'm in misery
Please, please, I'm beggin' like a fool
Woe is me, look who's blue

I said no gal's gonna ever tie me down
I'm goin' out every night and paint the town
Well I was doin' fine till I met you
Woe is me, look who's blue

Please, please, have pity on me
Oh, can't you see that I'm in misery
Please, please, I'm beggin' like a fool
Woe is me, look who's blue

I said there'd never be just one for me
And I'm gonna stay footloose and fancy free
No gal's gonna ever tell me what to do
Woe is me, look who's blue

Please, please, have pity on me
Oh, can't you see that I'm in misery
Please, please, I'm beggin' like a fool
Woe is me, look who's blue woh-oh, blue
