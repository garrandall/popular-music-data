Well, I called up my baby
On the telephone
It just kept ringing
No one was home

Then I saw my best friend
And her face turned red
When I asked my best friend
This is what she said

Your baby's gone surfing
Surfing, surfing and I know where
Your baby's gone surfing
Surfing, surfing and I know where

He's down at the beaches
Beaches, beaches having fun
Your baby's gone surfing
Surfing, surfing, like everyone

Your baby's gone dancing
Dancing, dancing to the surfing band
Your baby's gone dancing
Dancing, dancing to the guitar man

Your baby's gone dancing
Dancing, dancing, having fun
Your baby's gone dancing
Dancing, dancing like everyone

Oh, your baby's gone dancing with everyone
Your baby is surfing to the surfing band
Oh, he's down at the beach, having fun
Your baby is dancing, dancing
Dancing with everyone

Oh, your baby is dancing
Whoa, he's dancing
Whoa, he's dancing
Yes, he's dancing
