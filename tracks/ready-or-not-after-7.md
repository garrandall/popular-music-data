(Verse 1)
I'll give you the sun, the rain, the moon, the stars and the mountains
I'll give you the world, and all that you wish for
And even more
Girl, I'll love you more than you could know
And that's for sure
I'd climb the highest hill, cross the widest sea
Nothin' could discourage me
And I pray that you'll be always there for me
Forevermore

(Chorus)
Ready or not
I'll give you everything and more
All that I've got, it's yours
I'll give you everything
All that you're looking for

(Verse 2)
I'll give you my heart, my soul, my time, my love is a fountain
I will be your earth, oh and all that you need for
And even more
'Cause girl I love you more than words can show
My love is pure
I, I'd walk a thousand miles, sail a thousand seas
Nothin' will discourage me
And I pray that you will be always there for me
Forevermore

(Chorus)
Ready or not
(Don't you know, don't you know, you should know)
I'll give you everything (oh and more
(I'll give you more, you've got to know it, baby)
All that I've got (Baby, it's yours, little girl)
I'll give you everything (Every little thing)
All that you're looking for


(Bridge)
Everything is not anything
If you're not here to share my dreams
You don't know what it means to me
If you'll accept my love
I dedicate my love, my soul
My heart beats for you
Girl, I can't get enough so I'll wait for your love
There's nothing that I'd rather do

(Chorus)
Ready or not
I'll give you everything (ohlady) and more
(I'll give you more, you've got to know it, baby)
All that I've got (Hey, it's yours)
I'll give you everything (It's yours)
All that you're looking for

Ready or not (oh baby)
I'll give you everything...(I'm gonna give you, I'm gonna give you some more)...and more (Every little thing that I've got)
All that I've got (Hey, it's yours)
I'll give you everything (Every little thing, baby)
All that you're looking for

Ready or not
(Don't you know, don't you know, you should know)
I'll give you everything (oh and more
