When things go wrong
Don't walk away
That will only make it harder

Why you want to runaway
That won't get you any farther

I don't know how to do
Any more for you
You say I don't love you enough

Ooo, Eee, I
You hardly satisfy
Well I know you're needing so much

Your deep emotions, inside yourself
They're hard to face but you must try
You had your feelings for the one you love
You got me wondering why

I don't know how to do
Any more for you
You say I don't love you enough

Ooo, Eee, I
You hardly satisfy
Well I know you're needing so much

I don't know how to do
Any more for you
You say I don't love you enough

Ooo, Eee, I
You hardly satisfy
Well I know you're needing so much

I don't know how to do
Any more for you
How can I satisfy?
How can I satisfy?
