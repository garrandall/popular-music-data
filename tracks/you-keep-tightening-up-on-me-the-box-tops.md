I keep waiting&#133; 
For you to do something I don't like 
I keep waiting&#133; 
But everything you do, you do all right 
You give me love when I want you; 
You leave me alone when I don't 
Something says I ought to leave you, 
But something tells me I won't 

'Cause you keep tightening up on me, and I can't break away 
'Cause you keep tightening up on me, with a sweeter love every day. 
It scares me just a little bit, knowing I'll never be free 
Woman, I'm at your mercy, 'cause you keep 
Tightening up, tightening up, tightening up on me 

Yeah&#133; 
O-o-o&#133; yeah&#133; 
La-la-la&#133; 

Your kind of love&#133; 
Makes it hard for a man to say no to you 
One look at me&#133; 
And I know I've got to go to you 
Even when I'm looking away 
In my mind I can see you 
I ain't sure that I love you, baby, 
But I know that I need you 

'Cause you keep tightening up on me, and I can't break away 
'Cause you keep tightening up on me, with a sweeter love every day. 
It scares me just a little bit, knowing I'll never be free 
Woman, I'm at your mercy, 'cause you keep 
Tightening up, tightening up, tightening up on me 

Yeah&#133; 
O-o-o&#133; yeah&#133; 
Uh-uh-uh-huh&#133;o-o-o&#133; 

You keep tightening up on me, and I can't break away 
You keep tightening up on me, with a sweeter love every day
