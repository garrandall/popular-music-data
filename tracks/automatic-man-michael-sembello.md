Stayed up endless nights
Like some Frankenstein
Cybernetic dream
Something like you've never seen

He knows every dance
Pre-programmed romance
When he looks at you
I'm watching, too, through his video eyes

He was made to play the part
He's no ordinary man
He was made to break your heart
He's the Automatic Man
He's the Automatic Man

Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
He's the Automatic Man
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
He's the Automatic

His atomic heart
It has learned to feel
He cries electric tears
The impossible is real
Ah-be-auto-we-bo-we
Ah-be-auto-we-bo-we
Ah-be-auto-we-bo-we
Ah-be-auto-we-bo-we

He was made to play the part
He's no ordinary man
He was made to break your heart
He's the Automatic Man

Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
He's the Automatic Man
Beep! Beep! Four, five, six, seven, eight
He's the Automatic

I was such a lonely, lonely boy
Automatic was my toy
Never dreamed he would steal her away

One, two, three, four, five
Six, seven, eight
He's the Automatic Man
...
