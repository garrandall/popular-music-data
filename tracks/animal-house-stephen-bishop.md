Let me tell you 'bout some friends I know
They're kinda crazy but you'll dig the show
They can party till the break of dawn
At Delta Chi you can't go wrong

Otter, he's the ladies man
Every girl falls into his hands
Boon and Katy playing "Cat and Mouse"
And Mrs. Wormer, she's the queen of the

Animal House...

That Pinto he's a real swell guy
Clorette was jailbait but he gave her a try
Chip, Doug, and Greg, they're second to none
They studied under Attila the Hun

Mr. Jennings has got his wig on tight
Flouder's left shoe's always on his right
Babs and Mandy are having a pillow fight
With Day, Hoover, Otis Day and the Knights

Do the Bluto
Come on baby, dance with me
Maybe if we do the Bluto
We will get an "A" in lobotomy

Do the Bluto
Do the Bluto

Do the Bluto
Do the Bluto

Aw, come on!
Let me tell ya

Dean Wormer tried to shut us down
But he fell and he broke his crown
He didn't know about the Delta spunk
He came in handy when we were short a skunk

At the
Animal House...
