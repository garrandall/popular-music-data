I got a present for brother
Choo choo train 
And I'm just dyin' to see my dear ol' mother
Choo choo train 
So don't slow down til you see my home town

Choo choo train 
Choo choo train 
I know you're not a jet aeroplane
But you see my baby's waitin' at the station
So give me just a little mo' acceleration.
Choo choo train, yeah 

I got me a one-way ticket home
Choo choo train 
All my wild oats, Choo choo, done been sown
Choo choo train 


So don't slow down til you see my home town

Choo choo train 
Choo choo train 
I know you're not a jet aeroplane
But you see my baby's waitin' at the station
So give me just a little mo' acceleration
Choo choo train, yeah, yeah, uh

Choo choo train 
Choo choo train 
Can't you see the poor boy's goin' insane
Choo choo train 
Choo choo train 
I gotta see my baby a on'e more again...
