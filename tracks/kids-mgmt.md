You were a child
Crawling on your knees toward it
Making momma so proud
But your voice is too loud
We like to watch you laughing
You pick the insects off plants
No time to think of consequences

Control yourself
Take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting to be haunted
Control yourself
Take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting to be haunted

The water is warm
But it's sending me shivers
A baby is born
Crying out for attention
The memories fade
Like looking through a fogged mirror
Decisions to decisions are made and not bought
But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot
I guess not


Control yourself
Take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting to be haunted
Control yourself
Take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting to be haunted

Control yourself
Take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting
To be haunted
Control yourself
Take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting
To be haunted
Control yourself
Take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting
To be haunted
Control yourself
Take only what you need from it
A family of trees
