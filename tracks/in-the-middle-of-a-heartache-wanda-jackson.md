I'm in the middle of a heartache half out half in
Not quite out of love with you not too much in love with him
I'm in the middle of a heartache half way half blue
Can't give all my love to him when I'm still in love with you

Just when I think that I've forgotten you the mem'ry of your love grows dim
That old pain starts again of wanting you more than I ever wanted him
I'm in the middle of a heartache heart old heart new
Can't give all my love to him when I'm still in love with you

Just when I think...
