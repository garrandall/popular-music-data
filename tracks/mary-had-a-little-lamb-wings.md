Mary had a little lamb,
his fleece was white as snow,
Ev'rywhere that Mary went,
that lamb was sur to go.

And you could hear them singing:
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

He followed her to school one day,
it was against the rules,
Made the children laugh and play to
see a lamb at school.

You could hear them singing:
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

Soon the teacher turned it out,
still it lingered near,
Waited patiently about till
Mary did appear.

You could hear them singing:
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

"But the lamb loved Mary so",
the eager children cry,
"And Mary loves the lamb, you know",
the teacher did reply.

And you could hear them singing:
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
(Ev'ry body singing)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
