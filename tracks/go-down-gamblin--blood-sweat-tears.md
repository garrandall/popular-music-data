Born a natural loser - can't recall just where
Raised on brew and poker and a dollar here and there
Blackjack hand, dealer man, you better pay off that last bet
Two-bit hand, a 21 is all I ever get

Go down gamblin', say it when you're runnin' low
Go down gamblin' - you may never have to go

Down in a crap game, I've been losin' at roulette
Cards are bound to break me, but I ain't busted yet
'Cause I've been called a natural lover by that lady over there
Honey, I'm just a natural gambler but I try to do my share

Go down gamblin', say it when you're runnin' low
Go down gamblin' - you may never have to go
