The moon is bright above
Oh, what a night for love
And as I hold you near
I whisper in your ear

I go ape every time I see you smile
I'm a ding dong gorilla and I'll carry you cave man style
I'm gonna bump you on the head and love you all the while

Well, I'm a monkey's uncle who's a cousin to a chimpanzee
Like I was reeling and a rocking and a swinging from a coconut tree
Oh, honey, can't you see you bring out the monkey business in me?

Ranga tanga ring ting tong
I'm related to old King Kong
Honey, won't you say you're mine?
With a honky tonky monkey shine
When you hold my hand I'm a pre-historic man
I go ape

Like a barrel on monkeys on an abadaba honeymoon
I go squealing and a screechcing rand a howling like a big baboon
Well, baby, I'll explode if you don't come and kiss me soon

Yeah!

Whoa!

Oh, well, honey, you know that I'm gonna be true to you
I'll keep you in bananas and bring you coconuts, too
And we'll settle down in the nearest county zoo

Whoa

Ranga tanga ring ting tong
I'm related to old King Kong
Whoo
Honey, won't you say you're mine?
With a honky tonky monkey shine
When you hold my hand I'm a pre-historic man
I go ape
