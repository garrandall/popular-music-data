Legs movin' side to side, smack you in the air
Shoulders sideways, smack it, smack it in the air
Smack it, smack it in the air, legs movin' side to side
Smack it, smack it in the air; smack it, smack it in the air

Then I put up, my hands up, I put up, my hands up
I put up, my hands up then I'm spinnin' all my hands up (spinnin')
Spinnin' while my hands up (spinnin') spinnin' while my hands up (spinnin')
Spinnin' while my hands up then I'm tippin' all my hands up
Spinnin', I'm spinnin', I'm spinnin' while my hands up
I'm spinnin', I'm spinnin', I'm spinnin' while my hands up
(Drank)


Hold that cup like alcohol, oh let go like alcohol
Hold that cup like alcohol, don't you drop that alcohol
Never drop that alcohol, never drop that alcohol

Man it feel like rollin' dice, man this feel like rollin' dice
Man it feel like rollin' dice, seven twice, seven twice
Girl I'm tryna kick it with ya, girl I'm tryna kick it with ya
Man I'm tryna kick it with ya, my feet up, I kick it with ya
Man I swear I kick it with ya, girl I wanna kick it with ya
Man I know I kick it with ya, yeah I spin around and I kick it with ya

Oh wee BB freaky deaky, think me see she pink bikini
Rock that kufi, dye dashiki, Nefertiti, edges kinky
Sweatin' out my blow out, sweatin' out my presses
This trick about to go off, mad cause I'm so fresh
Fresher than you, I'm fresher than you
Fresher than you, oh
