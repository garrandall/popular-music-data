Do do do do...

There's a boy and there's a girl
As happy as can be
There's a heart with initials
Carved in a shady tree

There's a river and a waterfall
But the best part of it all
Is it's where I fell in love

It's a place where grass grows greener
And blooms a little more bright
It's a place for only dreamers
To steal a kiss goodnight

But the best part of it all
Is it's where I fell in love

There once was a time in my life
When I was so lonely
And then you entered my heart
And I knew you were my one and only

And there we'd stay in our paradise
Two lovers alone with no fear of lies
Until the day I die

There's a boy and there's a girl
As happy as can be
There's a heart with initials
Carved in a shady tree

There's a river and a waterfall
But the best part of it all
Is it's where I fell in love
