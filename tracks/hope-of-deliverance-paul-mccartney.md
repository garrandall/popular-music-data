I Will Always Be Hoping, Hoping.
You Will Always Be Holding, Holding
My Heart In Your Hand. I Will Understand.

I Will Understand Someday, One Day.
You Will Understand Always,
Always From Now Until Then.

When It Will Be Right, I Don't Know.
What It Will Be Like, I Don't Know.
We Live In Hope Of Deliverance From The Darkness That Surrounds Us.

Hope Of Deliverance, Hope Of Deliverance.
Hope Of Deliverance From The Darkness That Surrounds Us.

And I Wouldn't Mind Knowing, Knowing
That You Wouldn't Mind Going, Going Along With My Plan.

When It Will Be Right, I Don't Know.
What It Will Be Like, I Don't Know.
We Live In Hope Of Deliverance From The Darkness That Surrounds Us.

Hope Of Deliverance, Hope Of Deliverance.
Hope Of Deliverance From The Darkness That Surrounds Us.

Hope Of Deliverance, Hope Of Deliverance.
Hope Of Deliverance From The Darkness That Surrounds Us.

Hope Of Deliverance, Hope Of Deliverance.
Hope Of Deliverance From The Darkness That Surrounds Us.

Hope Of Deliverance, Hope Of Deliverance.
Hope Of Deliverance From The Darkness That Surrounds Us.
