All alone on a Sunday morning
Outside I see the rain is falling
Inside I am slowly dying
But the rain won't hide my crying, crying, crying

And you, don't you know the tears will burn the pillow?
Set this place on fire 'cause I'm tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple hello
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear my cry

Oh, I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you, you leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out over you

Never wanted to see things your way
Had to go astray, oh, why was I such a fool?
Now I see that the grass is greener
Is it too late for me to find my way home?
(How could I be so wrong?)
Leaving me all alone

Don't you know the hearts will cause an inferno?
Romance up in flames, why should I take the blame?
You were the one who left me neglected
(I'm so sorry)
Apology not accepted
Add me to the broken hearts you collected

Oh, I gave you all of me (gave me all of you)
How was I to know
You would weaken so easily?

Well, I, I don't know what to do
Now I'm all cried out over you

Oh, I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you, you leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out over you
(I'm all...)
Now I'm all cried out over you
