People get ready
People get ready

People get ready
There's a train a-coming
Picking up passengers
From coast to coast
All you need is faith
To hear diesels humming
You don't need no baggage
You just get on board

People get ready
For the train to Jordan
Picking up passengers
From coast to coast
All you need is faith
To hear diesels humming
You don't need no ticket
You just thank the Lord

Now there ain't no room
For the hopeless sinner
They got to hard on mankind
Just to save his own
Have pity on those
Whose chances are thinner
There's room for all
Among the Kingdom's Throne
...
