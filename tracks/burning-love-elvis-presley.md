Lord Almighty
I feel my temperature rising
Higher higher
It's burning through to my soul
Girl, girl, girl, girl
You're gonna set me on fire
My brain is flaming
I don't know which way to go


Your kisses lift me higher
Like a sweet song of a choir
You light my morning sky
With burning love


Oh, oh ooh
I feel my temperature rising
Help me, I'm flaming
I must be a hundred and nine
Burning, burning, burning
And nothing can cool me
I just might turn into smoke
But I feel fine


'Cause your kisses lift me higher
Like a sweet song of a choir
And you light my morning sky
With burning love


It's coming closer
The flames are now licking my body
Won't you help me
I feel like I'm slipping away
It's hard to breathe
And my chest is a-heaving
Lord, have mercy
I'm burning a hole where I lay


Your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet song of a choir
You light my morning sky
With burning love
With burning love
(Ah, ah, burning love)


I'm just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
