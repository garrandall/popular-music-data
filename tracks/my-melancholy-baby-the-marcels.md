Nah, not that thing again... sing Melancholy baby
All right... we will!

Come to me, my melancholy baby
Cuddle up and don't be blue
All your fears are foolish fancies, maybe
You know, dear, that I'm in love with you

Every cloud must have a silver lining
Wait until the sun shines through
Smile, my honey dear
While I kiss away each tear
Or else, I shall be melancholy too

Gee that's pretty, sing it again
Well all right

Come to me, my melancholy baby
Why don't you cuddle up and don't be blue
Smile, my honey dear
While I kiss away each tear
Or else, I may be melancholy too

Come to me my melancholy baby
(Repeat to fade)
