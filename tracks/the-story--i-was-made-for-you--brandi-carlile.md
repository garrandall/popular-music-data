All of these lines across my face
Tell you the story of who I am
So many stories of where I've been
And how I got to where I am
Ohh... But these stories don't mean anything
You've got no one to tell them to it's true...
I was made for you...

I climbed across the mountain tops
Swam all across the ocean blue
I crossed all the lines and I broke all the rules
And baby, I broke them all for you
Ohh... And it's even when I was flat broke
You made me feel like a million bucks you do
I was made for you...
Ohh...

You see the smile that's on my mouth
It's hiding the words that don't come out
And all of my friends who think that I'm blessed
They don't know my life is a mess
No they don't know who I really am
And they don't know what I've been through like you do
And I was made for you...

All of these lines across my face
Tell you the story of who I am
So many stories of where I've been
And how I got to where I am
Ohh... But these stories don't mean anything
You've got no one to tell them to it's true...
I was made for you...
I was made for you...

(Well it's true...)
