Come Saturday morning
I'm goin' away with my friend
We'll Saturday-spend
'Til the end of the day

Just I and my friend
We'll travel for miles
In our Saturday smiles
And then we'll move on
But we will remember
Long after Saturday's gone

Come Saturday morning
Come Saturday morning

Come Saturday morning
I'm goin' away with my friend
We'll Saturday-laugh
More than half of the day

Just I and my friend
Dressed up in our rings
And our Saturday things
And then we'll move on
But we will remember
Long after Saturday's gone

Come Saturday morning
Come Saturday morning

Come Saturday morning

Just I and my friend
We'll travel for miles
In our Saturday smiles
And then we'll move on
But we will remember
Long after Saturday's gone

Come Saturday morning
Come Saturday morning
Come Saturday morning
Come Saturday morning
