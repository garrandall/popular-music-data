Look in the mirror and tell me
Just what you see
What have the years of your life
Taught you to be?
Innocence dying in so many ways
Things that you dream of are lost
Lost in the haze


Hold on, baby hold on
Cause it's closer than you think
And you're standing on the brink
Hold on, baby hold on
Cause there's something on the way
Your tomorrow's not the same as today

Don't you recall what you felt
When you weren't alone?
Someone who stood by your side;
A face you have known
Where do you run when it's too much to bear?
Who do you turn to in need
When nobody's there?



Outside your door, he is waiting;
Waiting for you
Sooner or later you know
He's got to get through
No hesitation and no holding back
Let it all go and you'll know
You're on the right track
