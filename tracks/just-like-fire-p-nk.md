I know that I am running out of time
I want it all
And I'm wishing they'd stop tryna turn me off
I want it on

And I'm walking on a wire,
Trying to go higher
Feels like I'm surrounded
By clowns and liars
Even when I give it all away
I want it all

We came here to run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it

Just like fire, burning up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way

Just like magic, I'll be flying free
I'm 'a disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling. What you gonna say?
No one can be just like me any way

Just like fire

And people like to laugh at you
'Cause they are all the same
See I would rather we just go a different way
Than play the game

And no matter the weather,
We can do it better
You and me together,
Forever and ever
We don't have to worry 'bout a thing, 
No, 'bout a thing

We came here to run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it

Just like fire, burning up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way

Just like magic, I'll be flying free
I'm 'a disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling. What you gonna say?
No one can be just like me any way

Just like fire, fire, fire
Run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it

So look I came here to run it
Just 'cause nobody's done it
Y'all don't think I can run it
But look, I've been here, I've done it

Impossible? Please
Watch I do it with ease
You just gotta believe
Come on, come on with me

Oh, what's a girl to do?
(What, what?)
Hey, what's a girl to do?
(What, what?)
Oh, what's a girl to do?
(What, what?)
Oh, what's a girl to do?

Just like fire, burning up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way

Just like fire, burning up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way

Just like magic, I'll be flying free
I'm 'a disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling. What you gonna say?
No one can be just like me any way

Just like fire, fire
Run it, run it, run it
Just like fire
We came here to run it, run it, run it
