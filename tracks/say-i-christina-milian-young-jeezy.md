This is...this is...this is... hot
You like this
You are now witnessing
The fliest shit in the world
I can't think of nothing else to say
Christina Milian
Cool and Dre


I got the urge to scream out
Pull out the bird, let's be out
And I don't know about you
I'm got it popping like I'm suppose to do
Don't hold your breath girls breathe out
Sweat out the perm pull your weave out
And tell the world it's time and that we going to love you and hurry scream out loud
Say III..


Ima make it happen
Ima make a way
If you got something to prove
If you feel the same way
Say I...I

I'm going to keep it gangster
Ima make it hot
If you feeling like I do, then people throw your hands up
Say I...I

You want to dance then get down
You tryna chill then sit down
Do what you wanna to do
don't let nobody tell you what you re suppose to do
You want to go...you grinding
Tryna get me in bed
Tryna do the timing
I know you feel this rough
You with me people
And let me see your hands up

Ima make it happen
Ima make a way
If you got something to prove
If you feel the same way
Say I...I

Ya heard the lady
Say I if you feel it
Yeah

I'm going to keep it gangster
Ima make it hot
( Yeah you already know me Snowman)
If you feel like I do, then people throw your hands up
Say I...I


My nephew getting older and starting to talk
Now my mom's got sick and she can't walk
No high school diploma But I know math
Ain't write one song and she still want half
Dead beat dad is what the media say
Best father in the world is what my son will say
Won't stop 'til you roll, that's what his mom's going to say
But hey
That's the type of game you play
The media talk so bad about me
The streets doing so bad without me
Can't ban the snowman
This is thug motivation it's just part of the program
The first day of class and all you gotta do is stack cash to pass
Don't mind me I'm just thinking out loud
Purple haze got my head in the cloud

Getting to it, let's just face it
We can do it if we try
We can make it if we try, make it if we try (say I)
Ain't nothing to it
Let's just take it
We can make it if we try
Say I

Let's just do it
We can make it
I know we'll make it if we try
Say I

Whoaaa

Ima make it happen
Ima make a way
If you got something to prove
If you feel the same way
Say I...I

I'm going to keep it gangster
Ima make it hot
If you feeling like I do, then people throw your hands up
Say I...I

Getting to it, let's just face it
We can do it if we try
Ain't nothing to it
Let's just take it
We can make it if we try

Ima make it happen
Ima make a way
If you got something to prove
If you feel the same way
Say I...I

I'm going to keep it gangster
Ima make it hot
If you feel like I do, then people throw your hands up
Say I...I
