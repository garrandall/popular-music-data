This is a motherfuckin emergency!
(Let's go) Zone Fo', St. Louis - you ready?
Haha, A-T-L... let's go!
I told y'all I was gon' change the game
L.A. all day! They can't stop ya boy
They can't stop ya boy, I get money!

 Y'all motherfuckers ain't ready, hey!


Just walked through the door, what's it gonna be?
I can't get to the floor, boys all over me
(Where my party, p-party party, p-party people at?)
(Where my party, p-party party, p-party people at?)
(I just walked through the door, what's it gonna be?)
(I can't get to the flo', girls all over me)
Where my party, pa' party party pa' party people at?
Where my party, pa' party party pa' party people at?


It's Nelly motherfucker comin straight up out the Lou' and
All you New Edition-ass rappers better cool it now
'Fore I make a fool of y'all, paper stacked as tall as Yao
Ming, look at the bling, settings in rings lookin like basketballs
It's Nelly motherfucker comin straight up out the Lou' and
All you New Edition-ass rappers better cool it now
'Fore I make a fool of y'all, paper stacked as tall as Yao
Ming, look at the bling, settings in rings lookin like basketballs




Where my party people at? (Where my party people at?)


Well it's Fergie motherfucker comin straight from Cali-for-ni-A
Stuntin in my loc-locs, dreamin 'bout me M.I.A.
Boyfriend wonderin where I'm at, cause I'm in the spot-spot
Why he always tryin to be puttin me down on lock lock?
Well it's Fergie motherfucker comin straight from Cali-for-ni-A
Stuntin in my loc-locs, dreamin 'bout me M.I.A.
Boyfriend wonderin where I'm at, cause I'm in the spot-spot
Why he always tryin to be puttin me down on lock lock?




Patiently waitin and takin my time
Watchin these haters done come with they rhymes
Watchin these suckers all mimickin, gimmickin
Then they start fallin off one at a time
You be the searcher but you never could find
I promise you durrty I'm one of a kind
Mold is broken, the formula's mine
I killed the idea and destroyed the design


I was patiently waitin and takin my time
Now that I'm here I'm gettin my shine
All of you haters can kiss my behind
Specifically speakin I'm talkin 'bout mine
Don't need you to tell me I know that I'm fine
I'm killin it baby so call it a crime
Yeah you watch it but I'm stealin my time
I told you before that big girls don't cry

 Where my party people at?




Where my party people at? (Where my party people at?)
