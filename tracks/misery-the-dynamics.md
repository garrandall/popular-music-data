If you give me one more chance
I'll prove my love is true
(I'll prove my love is true)

And do all the things
That I'm supposed to do
(That I'm supposed to do)

But if I let you down
(If I let you down)
And you set me free
(Set me free)

Oh, I don't know but I think
I'd just live in misery

There is nothing I can do to
Make up for the
Wrong things I've done
(For the wrong I've done)

Cause when I met you, pretty baby
I knew you were the only one
(You were the only one)

But I couldn't see
(I couldn't see)
Just how it would be
(How it would be)

Oh, I don't know but I think
I'd just live in misery

Now I sit and cry cause
I lost everything that I had
(Everything I had)

But I have to go on and
Take the good with the bad
(Take the good with the bad)

And I still love you
(And I love you)
Hope you still love me
(Hope you love me)

Oh, and maybe you'll come back
And end this misery
