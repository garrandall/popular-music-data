This is a man's world
This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing
Nothing without a woman or a girl


You see man made the cars
To take us over the road
Man made the train
To carry the heavy load
Man made the electric light
To take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water
Like Noah made the ark


This is a man's world
This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing
Nothing without a woman or a girl



Man think about a little bit of baby girls
And a baby boys
Man makes them happy
Cause man makes them toys
And after man make everything everything he can
Even though the man makes money
To buy from other man


This is a man's world
This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing
Nothing without a woman or a girl



Oh how, how man needs a woman
I sympathize with the man that don't have a woman
He's lost in the wilderness
He's lost in bitterness
He's lost in loneliness
