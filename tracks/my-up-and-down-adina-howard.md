Turn the lights down baby 
And come to me baby 
Let me put something on your your (mmmmhhhm) 
Cause I gotta let you know 
What I want, Where I want, whenever I need it baby 
So you know you betta be ready tonight cause its on 

Haven't your heard 
about the upand down and round and round 
You should've known by now about my merri-go-round. 
Haven't your heard 
about the upand down and round and round 
You should've known by now about my merri-go-round. 

You said you were happy 
With your wife and happy home 
So what I don't understand, 
is why your here with me tonight 
'Cause if your girlfriend could do the 
freaky thing I do to you(hmmm) 
Then you do have the time to hang around 
for my ups and downs 
Deep in my heart 
I know I can make you moan 
Come on and lets get it on baby 
and all in my mind 
I gonna hold on tight 
cause tonight is the night 
we won't stop to we get it all right 
hold on tight 
tonight is the night 
baby your in for the time of your life 

Haven't your heard 
about the upand down and round and round 
You should've known by now about my merri-go-round. 
Haven't your heard 
about the upand down and round and round 
You should've known by now about my merri-go-round.
