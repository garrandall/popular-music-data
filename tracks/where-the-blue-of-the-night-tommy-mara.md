Where The Blue Of The Night
Meets The Gold Of The Day
Someone Waits For Me
And The Gold Of Her Hair
Crowns The Blue Of Her Eyes
Like A Halo, Tenderly
If Only I Could See Her
Oh How Happy I Would Be
Where The Blue Of The Night
Meets The Gold Of The Day
Someone Waits For Me
(Bing Whistles)
Where The Blue Of The Night
Meets The Gold Of The Day
Someone Waits For Me
