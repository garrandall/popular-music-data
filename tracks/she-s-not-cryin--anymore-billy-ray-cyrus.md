She used to cry when I'd come home late
She couldn't buy the lies I told
All she wanted was to be needed
Someone that she could call her own
Her love, I know I took for granted
Until she walked out of my door
Too little too late to say I'm sorry
'Cause she's not crying anymore


She's not crying anymore
And she ain't lonely any longer
There's a smile upon her face
A new love takes my place
She's not crying anymore


I guess she's really doing well
Now she's picked herself up off the ground
I wasn't there when I was needed
But I was there to let her down
Sometimes, you know, I feel so foolish
If I knew then what I know now
Another tear would never fall
'Cause I'd give our love my all
If we could work things out somehow


But she's not crying anymore
And she ain't lonely any longer
There's a smile upon her face
A new love takes my place
She's not crying anymore


She's not crying anymore
And she ain't lonely any longer
There's a smile upon her face
A new love takes my place
She's not crying anymore
There's a smile upon her face
A new love takes my place
She's not crying anymore
