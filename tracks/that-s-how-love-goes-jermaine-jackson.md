Girl, you walk around
With your head up in the sky
Yes, you do now
'Cause you hurt so many before
And never had to cry, no

But you better stop, honey
And realize, yeah
That one day soon
You're gonna have to be penalized

Oh

That's how love goes
You gotta reap just what you sewn
You'll get those tears and run free
Happen to you like it's happened to me, baby

That's how love goes
You gotta reap just what you sewn
You'll get those tears and run free
It's gonna happen to you
Just like it's happen to me, girl

Because you made me cry
You think you're the baddest of them all
Yes, you do now
Well, I hope I'm around, my dear
When he sets you free and you fall, yeah

Then you'll find it's not such a laugh
When tears run till you can't see, no, no, no
Your heartaches are gonna come
And so is your misery, yeah

That's how love goes
You gotta reap just what you sewn
You'll get those tears and run free
Happen to you like it's happened to me, baby

That's how love goes
You gotta reap just what you sewn
You'll get those tears and run free
It's gonna happen to you
Just like it's happen to me, girl

Well, well, come on help me say it

That's how love goes
You gotta reap just what you sewn
You'll get those tears and run free
Happen to you like it's happened to me, baby

That's how love goes
You gotta reap just what you sewn
You'll get those tears and run free
Happen to you like it's happened to me, baby

But let me tell you something

Baby you better stop
And take a real good look at yourself
'Cause when those heartaches strike
You're gonna wish you were somebody else

Oh, that smile that you're wearing
Gonna turn to a frown, yeah
You find the one that you love
Baby he's gonna put you down

Oh baby, oh baby, oh

That's how love goes
You gotta reap just what you sewn
You'll get those tears and run free
Happen to you like it's happened to me, baby

That's how love goes
You gotta reap just what you sewn
You'll get those tears and run free
Happen to you like it's happened to me, baby

That's how love goes
You gotta reap just what you sewn
You'll get those tears and run free
Happen to you like it's happened to me, baby

That's how love goes
You gotta reap just what you sewn
You'll get those tears and run free
Happen to you like it's happened to me, baby
