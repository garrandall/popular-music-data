Hey, everybody, yeah, don't you feel that there's something

People on their own are getting nowhere
I'm on the road to see
If anything is anywhere or waiting, just for me

Everynight I walk around the city
Seems like I'll never know
That feeling of being together when I go

And it's a long way there
It's a long way to where I'm going
And it's a long way there
It's a long way to where I'm going

Hey, everybody, don't you feel that there's something
But you know in a moment it is gone
I live for the day when I can hear people saying
That they know and they care for everyone

But I feel like I've been here for the whole of my life
Never knowing home

It's a long way, it's a long, long, long way there
I'm gonna keep on tryin', I'm gonna keep on tryin', yeah
I'm gonna keep on tryin', keep on tryin'

Been away from home for such a long time
And got to know this town
But I don't seem to matter much to anyone who's around
Is there anybody around

Everynight I walk around the city
Seems like I'll never know
The feeling of being together when I go

And it's a long way there
It's a long way to where I'm going
And it's a long way there
It's a long way to where I'm going

Everybody knows it's a long way there
Oh, everybody knows it's a long way there
Mmm, it's a long way

Driving around's kind of getting me down and I know, and I know
It's a long long way there
It's such a long long way, long way

Hey, everybody, yeah, don't you feel that there's something
Feel it, feel it
Hey, everybody, yeah, don't you feel that there's something
