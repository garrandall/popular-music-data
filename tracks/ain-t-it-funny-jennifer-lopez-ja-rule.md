Murda Inc, haha


It must be the ass that got me like damn
If they get any fatter, man, the Rule going to have to get at her
And our situation won't matter
I come to make you smile in the freakiest manners
J to the L-O, hello
No, I'm not Lee Harvey Oswald
I'm the Rule and I shot call
"Off the Wall" like MJ in his early days
It's the Inc. and Lopez now


Ain't that funny?
It's been a while since you came around
Now you want to see what's going down
Tryna tell me why you want my time
Tryna tell me how I'm on your mind (On your mind)
See, it never had to be this way
You should have never played the games you played
Now I'm seeing that you're kind of lame
Knowing how the situation change


Ain't that funny? (Ain't that funny?)
Baby, that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
Now I can smile and say
Ain't that funny? (Ain't that funny?)
Baby, that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny?


I remember how you walked away
Even when I tried to call your name
See at first I didn't understand
Now you're looking like a lonely man (Lonely man)
I remember how you did me wrong
And now you're hurting 'cause my love is gone
Everybody gets a chance to burn
You can take it as a lesson learned


Ain't that funny? (Ain't that funny?)
Baby, that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
Now I can smile and say
Ain't that funny? (Ain't that funny?)
Baby, that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny?


C-A, double D, ha
Double dose, ma
Fly by, red line, Testarossa
Oh I, never been a sucker for chocha
Spit the ism, hit them, get rid of 'em
And you know Tah get it gully
And ain't that funny?
How they want me see me working with money
But Caddy ain't a dummy
What these brodies want from me?
'Cause all I got is G, J.Lo
And Murda I.N.C


I really wish you wouldn't send me gifts
Tryna make me sit and reminisce
Tryna blind me with your blinging bling
Thought I told you love don't cost a thing (Love don't cost a thing)
Hope you realize that now I'm through
And I don't ever want to hear from you
I had enough of being there for you
Now I'm laughing why you play the fool


Ain't that funny? (Ain't that funny?)
Baby, that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
Now I can smile and say
Ain't that funny? (Ain't that funny?)
Baby, that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny?


Baby, is that your girlfriend?
I got my boyfriend
But maybe we can be friends
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Baby, I've got my boyfriend
Is that your girlfriend?
But maybe we can be friends
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah


Ain't it funny?
