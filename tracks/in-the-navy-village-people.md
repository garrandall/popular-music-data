In the navy
(We want you)
In the navy
(We want you in the captain's crew)

(In the navy)
Yes you can sail the seven seas
(In the navy)
Yes you can put your mind at ease
(In the navy)
Come on people and make a stand
(In the navy, in the navy)

We want you, we want you
We want you, in the captain's crew
We want you, we want you
We want you, in the captain's crew

Where can you find plesure
Search the world for treasure
Learn science technology
Where can you begin to make
Your dreams all come true
On the land or on the sea

Where can learn to fly,
Play in sports or skindive
Study oceanography
Sign up for the big band or sit in the grandstand
When your team and others meet

(In the navy)
Yes you can sail the seven seas
(In the navy)
Yes you can put your mind at ease
(In the navy)
Come on now, people and make a stand
(In the navy, in the navy)

(In the navy)
Come on, protect the motherland
(In the navy)
Come on and join and join your fellow man
(In the navy)
Come on, people and make a stand
(In the navy, in the navy)
