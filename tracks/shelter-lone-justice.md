I procured a small piece of the treasure, collections from a former era
Dating back to forever, the warrior became protector,
Quoted from the Book of the Law, I don't govern them,
I summon them, speaking in tongues again,
Started with a trumpet, woodwinds, strings
The conductor brings the drums in, fingers trigger the drum kit,
Other emcees be nervous or something, rhymes in abundance,
Hip Hop Justice, Rappers are captured and punished,
Drawn and quartered, liars are denied water,
You still alive? I repeat in a revised order, 10
Skull is a submarine hull
Screen doors protect the motherboard core from extreme heat warp,
My mind dives deep beneath yours, Poseidon Trident Seahorse
Bubbles form I scream with extreme force,
Marineris Trench detour to Ultima Thule,
Let me explain what my sonar saw,
Upholding the Holy Rosary, patrolling the Open Seas,
At U-Boat speed beneath the Tsunami, where I'm supposed to be,
Industrialists, civilians, women and children directly,
Military chiefs, aristocrats in the buildings, 20
Membership is based off your raw intelligence,
400 screen video editing with hard evidence,
The clinical Professor of rhymes from Pepperdine,
Co-signed by GlaxoSmithKline designs,
The Universe provided the lighting to see what I was writing,
The results were blinding, Lyrics, Timing,
Shut the fuck up and stop whining,
Instinct controls how you think before deciding, so keep vibing,
Swimming naked in the open, a lone shark begins to circle me,
Instead of trying to murder me, it tried to flirt with me, 30
I got away nervously, talked about it purposefully,
Next time I see it, it's going to have a word with me,
I guess it wasnât meant to be,
Under an assumed Identity I resumed PsyOps on the enemy,
USA made, field grade steel face,
Moving at a Canibus pace in the proto subspace,
I am not here to negotiate eliminate
The face on the photograph we have in our database,
No emcee could rhyme like this, there's no challenge,
His Poet Laureateship pontificates balance, 40
This lyrical pyramid was discovered by accident,
I know I could build it fast if I block and tackle it,
Judge me fairly, compare me,
To Dante Alighieri's Purgatorio theory,
Assigned to train and equip to spit, who's ready?
I'll need a volunteer, do I have any?
Next year I'll get my SPINGS a master space badge,
After that I'll stop flying fixed wing aircraft,
Most of you will never understand what I mean
My dreams are broken into storyboard scenes, 50
Worm screw elevators, descending to the bottom of the volcanoâs crater,
Inside the Devil's Chamber,
"That is not dead which can eternally lie
and with strange aeons even death may die",
The leaders lies got me reassigned, my loyalty was redefined,
They will not be allowed to see the rhymes,
What ought to crawl has learned to walk,
One ought not to think is what Rumsfeld thought,
I'ma take you for a walk through a beautiful place called Honey Swamp,
We'll shoot hoops at Mosquito Lagoon Park 60
The whirlpool of gravity traps me
Still allowing me to circle the M51 galaxy
Rap for me reduces the stress dramatically,
Negative time produces antigravity,
Inject the gas into the centrifuge mass,
The Teleological Dynamic will enhance,
Watch me wet up your weed then bust up your teeth,
Make you run for your life like there is a bus up the street,
The Dr. and I would meet, at 29 Palms Joshua Tree
I always had a lot to debrief, 70
Killing my myself, killing my health, rebuilding myself,
Nobody ever feels what I felt,
Modifying the weather from behind a weather shield,
Writing with a feathered quill, getting more ill,
The woman who is there, she will take care of you,
With (N)exium, Avodart, (L)ipitor, and (T)heraflu,
Rap Music Profession Immunosuppressants,
One question per second, One answer per session,
Hip Hop made me, Hip Hop praised me,
Ain't nothing changed me since 1980, 80
Involuntary catalepsy, battle me baby!!!,
1000 Bars nigga, after that maybe!!,
Murder, murder, murder, kill kill kill drills,
Williams was real ill, but now I chill,
An asteroid field where every rock is shaped like my seal,

I do it for civilians, I do it for the soldiers,
Raptors, Comanches, STRYKERS, Cobras,
Back at the TOC with GW Prescott
Grid location missile lock lift up the block, 90
I gotta spit âtil the story is told,
It's a gift, this story is a part of my soul,
We shouldn't keep fighting, the Earth is our home,
If we destroy Mother Earth, where will we go?,
Starving in destitution, dying for retribution,
Why would you wanna blow a hospital? You stupid?
Our now fruitless creations used to be in abundance,
Like something harder than Tungsten, break your arm if you punch it, 90
I ride on a flatbed chariot, four ostriches carry it,
I control their movements with lariats, 100
Polygraphs flutter, the Lovecraft Craft Lover,
Quoting my favourite Inventor, "I see excitement coming"
I raise my hand, lightening bolts stream from it,
I see excitement coming, I see excitement coming,
Unsatisfied, I decide to redefine rhyme,
To create product of an applied mind,
They say "we're divided" I say we're small minded,
Right after I said it I moved to a small island,
There was no contingency plan given to me,
Tell the motherfucker send his transcripts to me, 110
Swear your allegiance the tuition is free,
To be a mini me version with minor abilities,
7.83 hertz from the Earth magnified
Signal Intelligence emanating from your mind,
At the Observatory summit of Mt. Graham,
Looking through this starlight scope in my hand,
Beautiful longitudinal musical lyrics,
Fragments of Olympian Gossip is my vision,
If A is a success in life,
Then A must equal X plus Y plus Z no doubt, 120
If work equals X and play equals Y,
Then Z must be equal to you shutting your mouth,
Surprisingly got The John Campbell award for writing,
By summarizing that rhyming can be dehumanizing,
From the Kinetic to the Energetic,
To the magnetic, ultra, electro, and uncensored resonance,
I need to be alone, you cannot comfort me like my poems,
1000 Bars put me in the zone,
The Pope shook, they ransacked Rome and burnt books,
I ran back home to hide mine in the woods, 130
Salute, I would like to propose this next toast,
to maturation barrels I carved from French Oak,
The minerals where they grow determine the stability of the flow,
I might get drunk and boast,
Corruption is necessary, but tell me who's the beneficiary,
Which one of us will sing Hail Mary?,
Hip Hop supposed to be about endurance,
But every time you rhyme not just when I'm touring,
Acupuncture point or plus, is not enough,
I need more pain so I can pretend to be tough, 140
The facts too acute to repute, or debate,
My face, is a slim sleek gas mask shape,
My dream was identical seven nights in a row,
I saw a sideways 8 wrapped around a microphone,
The window is closing, from the other side it looks like it's opening,
Where am I trying to go with this?,
Fire and Ash fallout, that's what it's all about,
We must construct a shelter, and then build a wall around it,
All the parents want to do is look at the body
But, it won't happen âtil after the official autopsy, 150
A good psychological environment for science,
I'm memorizing visualizing peace and quiet,
Father Author Poor Pauper has poor posture,
As filthy as the collar of a dirty grave robber,
This is my unacknowledged special access project,
Time reversed waves in nonlinear optics,
The coral reef is changing from green to amber,
Scientist scramble to come up with new answers,
The truth is well within my sphere of pursuit,
But I'm unprepared to take action just like you, 160
The innate need for Canibus to be professional,
Make it difficult indeed for me to connect with you,
Greetings and Salutations, my equations are inundated with information,
Electro Cranial Stimulation,
Burn skin off face, burn face off skeletal plate,
Plasma Ray Gun is just one explanation,
Man Made Membrane roofing remediation,
Any and all entry points have immigration,
One meter beside the Hubble outside the bubble,
The effects of gravity on my muscles were quite subtle, 170
I do what I want to do, I have always been that way,
Because I have always thinked that way,
Attach the piezoelectric transducer to your computer,
Poet Laureate is the future!!!,
Pulsating Lights and Sounds surrounds spirits,
Bio Oral Beats, layered underneath lyrics,
250 thousand cycles per second, for Dolphin hearing,
The Electrical Optical Coupling Gear is effective,
88 Kilometres above the planet,
My rhymes harness a power beyond your understanding, 180
The Gods began to call me, I looked up stars fell towards me
And scorched me to a metaphor freak,
The authentic Command Doctrine of George WashingtonHimself
GW I'm positive it's him,
I proof read my writtens, eat a chicken with the skin missing,
Spend the whole night out binge drinking,

First it was vote or die, now it's don't vote, why?
Weed is now legalized are you high? 190
Rhymes compartmentalized seperatized to prevent bootlegging pirates,
Be my guest keep trying,
The bird chirps dying in the dirt because the earth is hurt,
But not before I start cursing first,
Not so fast Mr. Iconoclast,
If you don't leave the bottle outside you can't pass,
Gather the evidence, then give it to the President,
Don't reprimand him, ask him for help next,
A lamp with no electrode will not glow,
We need some new bright ideas that we did not know, 200
You cannot fold under the political pressure,
You gotta take prudent and precautionary measures,
I think of rhymes in my mind when I autograph sign,
I can't wait to sign an autograph for the last time,
A Luciferian web, everyday we are burying dead,
Every colour in America bled,
This is empirical evidence of the greatest collection of Canibus sentences,
You'll never reach the end of it,
Fire and forget, rhyme for respect,
I didn't get that so I wrote Poet Laureate, 210
The Hubble Space Telescope images changed Bis,
And nothing on this Planet can dissuade this,
They left me dehydrated by the Nile River naked but I made it,
With passion of a Microphone Patriot,
Music is my bread and butter, why should I suffer,
My publicist said she could get me the Time Life's cover,
The spin off from the Press should be able to feed you,
But I declined âcause I'm familiar what greed can do,
I can not lose or win,
I would only like to be remembered as the dark skinned Lizard King, 220
Into the bottomless pool of Poetry I plunge,
Let it be said, let it be written, let it be done,
Publicly coming forward with my metaphors to share,
About the space serpents flying around in the troposphere,
Poet Laureate Infinity,
I WILL FOREVER BE THE ILLEST LYRICALLY! 226

Poet Laureate Infinity,
Poet Laureate Infinity,
Poet Laureate Infinity,
THIS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE IN HISTORY!
