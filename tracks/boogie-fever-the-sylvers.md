Boogie fever
Got to boogie down
Boogie fever
I think it's going around

I took my baby to the drive-in show
She turned the speaker down
And then she turned on the radio
I watched a silent movie, diggin' funky sound

She's got the boogie fever
She likes to boogie down
Boogie fever
I think it's going around

I took my baby to the pizza parlor (pizza parlor)
To get a bite to eat
I put some money in the jukebox for her
You know she ate her pizza dancing to the beat

She's got the boogie fever
She likes to boogie down
Ah-aa-aa, She's got the boogie fever
I think it's going around

All night long, we did the bump, bump, bump
Yes we did, yes we did, yes we did, yeah
She kept it going strong, doin' the bump, bump, bump
Doin' the bump, bump, bump (yeah)

I called the doctor on the telephone (Doctor, doctor)
Said doctor, doctor, please. I, I, I,
I got this feeling rockin' and a'reelin'. Tell me,
What can it be, is it some new disease?

They call it boogie fever
You've got to boogie down
Ah, haa-aa, just get on down
Boogie fever
I think it's going around

Fever, fever, fever. Oh-oh-ooo

All night long, we did the bump, bump, bump
Yes we did, yes we did, (Yaaaa) yes we did
We kept it going strong doin' the bump, bump, bump

(Yaaaa), Everybody's got the boogie fever
Boogie fever baby
Boogie down, now get on down, now get on down
(Boogie fever), Boogie fever
I think it's going around and around and around

I (I) got the boogie fever
And I said, you (you) got the boogie fever
I said, she's (she's) got the boogie fever
Everybody's got the boogie fever

Boogie fever
Boogie down
Just get on down, just get on down
Boogie fever
