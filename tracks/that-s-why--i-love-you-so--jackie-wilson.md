The way you make me feel like I belong
The way you make me right when I am wrong
The way you sacrifice just for me
Just how lucky can a poor man be?

That is why
(that's why I love you so)
That is why...
(that's why I love you so)
Don't you know, baby...
(that's why I love you so)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want the world to know!

The way you rub my back when I'm in pain
The way you soothe me so I won't complain
And when you kiss me with your ruby-red lips
It thrills me so, I turn a back-over flip

That is why...
(that's why I love you so)
Don't you know, baby...
(that's why I love you so)
That is why...
(that's why I love you so)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want the world to know!

If Shakespeare thought that Juliet
Really loved Romeo from the time they met
He would blow his top if he could see
Just how you've been lovin' me

The way you rub my back when I'm in pain
The way you soothe me so I won't complain
And when you kiss me with your ruby-red lips
It thrills me so, I turn a back-over flip

That is why...
(that's why I love you so)
That is why...
(that's why I love you so)
C'mon now, baby...
(that's why I love you so)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want to... take it easy, baby!

(that's why I love you so)
Take it easy, honey...
(that's why I love you so)
Don't you know now
(that's why I love you so)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want the... one more time, now!

(that's why I love you so)
C'mon, c'mon, baby...
(that's why I love you so)
