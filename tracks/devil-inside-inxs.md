Here comes the woman, with the look in her eye
Raised on leather, with flesh on her mind
Words as weapons, sharper than knives
Makes you wonder, how the other half die? Other half die
Makes you wonder, wonder, wonder

Here come the man, with the look in his eye
Fed on nothing, but full of pride
Look at them go, look at them kick
Makes you wonder, how the other half live


The devil inside, the devil inside
Every single one of us the devil inside
The devil inside, the devil inside
Every single one of us the devil inside


Here come the world, with the look in its eye
Future uncertain, but certainly slight
Look at the faces, listen to the bells
It's hard to believe we need a place called hell, place called hell

Here comes the woman, with the look in her eye
Raised on leather, with flesh on her mind
Words as weapons sharper than knives
Makes you wonder, how the other half die

The devil inside, yeah, yeah, yeah
The devil inside, yeah, yeah, yeah
