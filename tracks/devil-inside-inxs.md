Here comes the woman
With the look in her eyes
Raised on leather
With flesh on her mind
Words as weapons
Sharper than knives
Makes you wonder
How the other half died
The other half died

The devil inside, the devil inside
Every single one of us, the devil inside
The devil inside, the devil inside
Every single one of us, the devil inside

Here come the man
With the look in his eyes
Fed on nothing
But full of pride
Look at them go
Look at them kick
Makes you wonder
How the other half live
The other half live
How the other half, live

The devil inside, the devil inside
Every single one of us, the devil inside
The devil inside, the devil inside
Every single one of us, the devil inside

The devil inside, the devil inside, and
Every single one of us, the devil inside
And, every single
Every single one of, us
The devil inside
Devil inside
The devil
Devil inside
