The greatest romance that's ever been sold

So what do U know, U and me
Finally face 2 face
Checking each other up and down
In all of the obvious places
Was there ever a reason 4 us 2 be apart?
The air that fills up this room says, "not hardly"
So this is where U end, and U and I begin
(That's where U and I, U and I begin)
The greatest romance that's ever been sold
The greatest romance that's ever been sold

Baby, baby
Now your mind is open
2 poetry seldom heard
Ur heart has never been broken
Until U've heard these words:
"Your body was designed 2 respond 2 mine
In spite of your desire 2 mold me"
And in the middle of it all -
We kiss and like rain (like rain) we fall into

The greatest romance that's ever been sold
The greatest romance that's ever been sold

Oh, I know U can feel me,know that U can dance
But what do you know about the greatest romance?
Not what U think, but what U believe
What was the real reason that Adam never left Eve?
And if the truth sounds like a memory
Then U know it was meant to be (meant 2 be), meant 2 be
Leave your inhibitions behind come on, come on, and see
So this is where U end (this is where U end)
And U and I begin ... (U-hu)

The greatest romance that's ever been sold
The greatest romance that's ever been sold

I know U can feel, I know that U can dance
But what do you know about the greatest romance?
(The greatest romance ...)
Not what U think, but what U believe
Can U tell me the reason (reason) that Adam never left Eve?
(The greatest (greatest) romance (romance) ...)
Listen 2 me
(... that's ever been sold)

U brought me
The grapes from the vine, yes U did
(The greatest romance ...)
Can I talk 2 U
(... that's ever been sold)
Listen
U help me 2 remember the secrets of time
And U - U - U, U offer me your love, your love, your love
So divine
And in return, girl, in return I will surrender
Oh yeah, I will surrender, oh yes, I will

The greatest romance that's ever been sold
