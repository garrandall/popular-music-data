When the world was on my shoulders
And all hope for tomorrow was gone
You took my hand, and baby
You made me see there's a future for me

And I can make it with you, baby
I can make it with you
I can make it with you by my side

And when life had lost its meaning
When my dreams had been shattered by time
You touched my hand, and baby
You made me see there's a future for me

And I can make it with you, baby
I can make it with you
I can make it with you by my side

I remember when I was down
I was lost but I've been found
I can make it with you, baby
I can make it with you, baby
I can make it with you, baby
