Lying by your side I watch you sleeping
And in your face the sweetness of a child
Murmuring the dreams you won't recapture
Though it will haunt the corners of you mind


Oh, I've lost you yes, I've lost you
I can't reach you anymore
We ought to talk it over now
But reason can't stand in for feeling


Who can tell when summer turns to autumn
And who can point the moment love grows cold
Softly without pain the joy is over
Though why it's gone will neither of us know


Oh, I've lost you yes, I've lost you
I can't reach you anymore
We ought to talk it over now
But reason can't stand in for feeling, oh


Oh, I've lost you yes, I've lost you
I can't reach you anymore
We ought to talk it over now
But reason can't stand in for feeling


Six o'clock the baby will be crying
And you will stumble, sleeping to the door
In the chill and solemn gray of morning
We play the parts that we have learned too well


Oh, I've lost you yes, I've lost you
I can't reach you anymore
We ought to talk it over now
But reason can't stand in for feeling


I've lost you yes, I've lost you
I can't reach you anymore
We ought to talk it over now
But reason can't stand in for feeling, oh
Oh, I've lost you yes, I've lost you
I can't reach you anymore
We ought to talk it over now
But reason can't stand in for feeling, oh
