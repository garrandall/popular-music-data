I'm so scared that the way that I feel is written all over my face
When you walk into the room I wanna find a hiding place.
We used to laugh, we used to hug, the way that old friends do.
But now a smile and a touch of your hand just makes me come unglued.
It's such a contradiction
Do I lie or tell the truth?
Is it fact or fiction?
Oh, the way I feel for you.

It's so complicated
I'm so frustrated,
I wanna hold you close, I wanna push you away,
I wanna make you go, I wanna make you stay.
Should I say it?
Should I tell you how I feel?
Oh, I want you to know, but then again I don't,
It's so complicated.

Just when I think I'm under control, I think I finally got a grip,
Another friend tells me that my name is always on your lips.
They say I'm more than just a friend, they say I must be blind.
Well, I admit that I've seen you watch me from the corner of your eye.
Oh, it's so confusing,
Yeah,I wish you'd just confess.
But think of what I'd be losing,
If your answer wasn't yes.

It's so complicated
I'm so frustrated,
I wanna hold you close, I wanna push you away,
I wanna make you go, I wanna make you stay.
Should I say it?
Should I tell you how I feel?
Oh, I want you to know, but then again I don't,
It's so complicated.

I hate it
Cause I've waited so long for someone like you.
What do I do?

Oh, Should I say it?
Should I tell you how I feel?
Oh, I want you to know, but then again I don't.
It's so complicated.

It's so complicated.
It's so complicated.
