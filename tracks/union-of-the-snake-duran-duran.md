Nightshades on a warning
Give me strength, give me a light
Give me anything even sympathy
There's a chance you could be right

If I listen close I can hear them singers, oh
Voices in your body coming through on the radio

The union of the snake is on the climb
Moving up it's gonna race it's gonna break
Through the borderline

The union of the snake is on the climb
Moving up it's gonna race it's gonna break
Through the borderline

If I listen close I can hear them singers, oh
Voices in your body coming through on the radio

The union of the snake is on the climb
Moving up it's gonna race it's gonna break
Through the borderline

The union of the snake is on the climb
Moving up it's gonna race, it's gonna break
Through the borderline

The union of the snake is on the climb
Moving up it's gonna race it's gonna break
Through the borderline

The union of the snake is on the climb
Moving up it's gonna race, it's gonna break
To the borderline
