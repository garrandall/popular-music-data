A B, A B C D

The moon up above, it shines down upon our skin
Whispering words that scream of outrageous sin
We all want the stuff that's found in our wildest dreams
It gets kinda rough in the back of our limousine

That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre
That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre

A strawberry mind, a body that's built for two
A kiss on the spine, we do things we never do
Come swallow the pride and joy of the ivory tower
We'll dance on the roof, make love on a bed of flowers

That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre
That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre

The moon up above, it shines down upon our skin
(It shines down on our skin)
Whispering words that scream of outrageous sin
(Whispering words that scream of, scream of sin)
We all want the stuff that's found in our wildest dreams
(Wildest dreams, yeah)
It gets kinda rough in the back of our limousine

That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre
That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre

That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre
(A strawberry mind, a body that's built for two, me and you)
That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre
(A kiss on the spine, we do things we never do)

That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre
That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre
That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre
That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre

That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre
That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre
That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre
That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre

What we are, what we are, a love bizarre
What we are, what we are, a love bizarre
What we are (what we are), what we are (what we are)
A love bizarre (a love bizarre)

That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre
That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre

That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre
That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre
That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre
That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre

That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre
That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre
That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre
That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre
