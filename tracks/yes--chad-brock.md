She moved into my old apartment
That's how we got this whole thing started

She called and said that I had mail
Waiting there for me
I told her that I'd come and get it
How could I know in just a minute
That I'd be standing face to face
With my own destiny

Oh and we sat there talkin' just like we were old friends
Oh then I asked her, "Can I see you again?"

And she said, "Yes!"
And I said, "Wow!
And she said, "When?"
And I said, "How about right now!"
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said, "Yes!"

But days flew by just like a fast train
And nothing else has been on my brain
Except the thought of how she makes me
The man I want to be
She's the one I want for a million reasons
Loving her is just like breathin'
It's easy and it's obvious
That she was made for me

Oh then it happened one night lookin' in her eyes
Oh when I popped the question much to my surprise

She said, "Yes!"
And I said, "Wow!
And she said, "When?"
And I said, "How about right now!"
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said, "Yes!"

So we called the preacher, family and friends
And nothin's been the same since...

She said, "Yes!"
And I said, "Wow!
And she said, "When?"
And I said, "How about right now!"
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said, "Yes!"

She said, "Yes!"
