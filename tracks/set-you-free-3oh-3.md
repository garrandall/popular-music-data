Who-oh-oh-oh are you anyways?
I can't count how many days you weren't here.
The walls were closing in on me,
But I don't live in there no more.

There's a place in my head
That repeats what you said,
That repeats what you said that day.

You're afraid the mistakes that you made
Dug your grave but baby,
That's the price you pay.

So don't shut down
This town, ain't big enough for both of us, whoa.

And now I've found
You'll never get enough from me,
So, baby, I'm a set you free,
Yeah I'm a set you free.


Who-oh-oh-oh are you anyways?
I can't count how many days you weren't here.
The walls were closing in on me,
But I don't live in there no more.

Who-oh-oh-oh are you anyways?
I can't count how many days you weren't here.
The walls were closing in on me (closing in),
But I don't live in there no more.

I been trying to relate to
All the things that make you
Act the crazy ways you do (you do)

But that will take patience and headaches
To make sense
Some the things you put me through

So don't shut down
This town, ain't big enough for both of us, whoa

And now I've found
You'll never get enough from me
So, baby, I'm a set you free,
Yeah, I'm a set you free


Who-oh-oh-oh are you anyways?
I can't count how many days you weren't here.
The walls were closing in on me,
But I don't live in there no more.

Who-oh-oh-oh are you anyways?
I can't count how many days you weren't here.
The walls were closing in on me (closing in)
But I don't live in there no more (no more)


All the pictures and the windows on the wall
Are closing in on me
I thought that you're suppose to learn from
What went wrong in history.
So you keep doing everything you can
And never will get to me.
I bet you remember the day you were better
As soon as we severed
And you were free


Who-oh-oh-oh are you anyways?
I can't count how many days you weren't here.
The walls were closing in on me (closing in)
But I don't live in there no more (no more)

Who-oh-oh-oh are you anyways?
I can't count how many days you weren't here.
The walls were closing in on me (closing in)
But I don't live in there no more (no more)

Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa
