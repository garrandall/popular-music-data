Darlin'

Oh Darlin'
I wish you weren't lying
When you said that you're leaving me Darlin'

I know it's my pride
That stands in the
The way of my feelings
I'm humbled and kneeling

I never thought I'll feel this way
I really wanna learn to say:
Oh my Darlin', Oh my Darlin'

Oh my Darlin'
I know what you thinking
And I know what the answer is, Darlin'
I'm feel like I'm sinking
Cause is no love inside of me I know!
We can make it o'right

I never thought I'll feel this way
I really wanna learn to say:
So come on Darlin'

Don't pull me out!
Please let me in!
You are the reason
I should be in your arms, in your arms!

I know, we can make it o'right... Yeah!
I never thought I'll feel this way
I really wanna learn to say:
Oh my Darlin!
Uh, di di di Darlin'

Darlin'
Darlin' (Should we'll keep on trying?)
Darlin'
Darlin' (Should we'll keep on trying?)

Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na Yeah!
Darlin' (Should we'll keep on trying?)
