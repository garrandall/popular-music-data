This is the end
You made your choice and now my chance is over
I thought I was in
You put me down and say I'm goin' nowhere


Save me darlin'
I am down but I am far from over
Give me somethin'
I need it all 'cause I am runnin' over


Back in the race
I'm movin' in 'cause I am getting closer
I'm diggin' in
I want it more than anything I've wanted


Save me darlin'
I am down but I am far from over
Give me somethin'
I need it all 'cause I am runnin' over

Save me darlin'
I am down but I am far from over
Give me somethin'
I need it all 'cause I am runnin' over


I'm runnin' over
I'm runnin' over
