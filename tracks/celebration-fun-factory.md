Let's have a celebration
By the sea (by the sea)
And get together in peace and harmony
A celebration, come and, have some fun
Singing oh oh oh oh, uh oh oh oh

Bang bang bang
Here comes the jam
It's the Fun Factory coming with the next party jam
So what's up what's on
Baby come on tell me
Is it me is it you
Chillin' with the girlies
Ridin' with the fellas in my car
Dee dee dee dee dam dee dee dam
So come on wave your hands in the air
So come on wave it like you just don't care
And if you're down with the Fun Factory groove

Somebody say oh yeah !

Slam slam slam
Here comes the van
It's the Fun Factory and we do the best we can
We ringadingadinga
We ringadingadong
We hype up the place with the boombastic song
We move to the left
We move to the right
And wave our hands from side to side
You better step back 'cause we don't stop we run
So let's get together and have some fun

There is a place where we have some fun
Yes it's better all together and we're dancing one on one
