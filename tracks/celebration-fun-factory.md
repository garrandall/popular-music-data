Fun Factory and Captain Jack
Wild
Make that change and open your heart

Change, we need a change so open your heart
Because it's time to make a new start
Let peace and love back into your heart
To make a better place, change, change
To make a better place

Listen up, it's a brand new track
Fun Factory and Captain Jack
90s style, we party wild
Throw your hands up, don't be shy
Free your soul let down your guard
Make that chance and open your heart
Open your heart
Make that chance and open your heart

Change, we need a change so open your heart
Because it's time to make a new start
Let peace and love back into your heart
To make a better place, change, change

Change, we need a change so open your heart
Because it's time to make a new start
Let peace and love back into your heart
To make a better place, change

Change, change, we need a change
To make this world a better place
Open your mind, open your heart
Before this world falls apart
We need peace, love and harmony
Hand in hand just you and me
No one's right, no one's wrong
Work together, we are strong

Let's have a celebration
Invite the hole damn nation
Unity is something, we should embrace in
Stop this hate cause the color of our skin
Love is the answer that starts within
Cause if you can't love yourself
You can't win, you can't win

To make a better place
Change, we need a change so open your heart
Because it's time to make a new start
Let peace and love back into your heart
To make a better place
Change, change, change, change
To make a better place, change
