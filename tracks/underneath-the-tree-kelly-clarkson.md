You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

Tonight
I'm gonna hold you close
Make sure that you know
I was lost before you
Christmas was cold and grey
Another holiday alone to celebrate
But then one day everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

I found what I was looking for
A love that's meant for me
A heart that's mine completely
Knocked me right off my feet
And this year I will fall
With no worries at all
'Cause you are near and everything's clear
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

And then one day everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree
Tonight
