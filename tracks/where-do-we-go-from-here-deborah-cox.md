When you're in love 
Some things you take for granted until someone 
Pulls it apart and leaves you with half of your heart 
How do I trade the best I have for less 
Without giving up 
Should I slowly accept that we'll be no more than just friends 

How do I know 
When to let go? 
I know what I'm feeling inside 
But part of me still wants to try 
So tell me 


Where do we go from here? 
Why's my heart filled with so much fear? 
When all that you are is all I need and more 

There's no winning this 
The battle's just begun 
I know it's over, but I still feel the same 
You'll always remain number one 
'Cause letting go 
Warrants so much 
I know what I'm feeling inside 
But part of me still wants to try 
So tell me 



Letting go, warrants so much 
I know what I'm feeling inside 
But part of me still wants to try
