Heads up, heads up
Here's another one
And a, and another one

Yeek yeek
(Whoop whoop!)
Why you all in my ear?
Talkin' a whole bunch of shit that I ain't tryin' to hear
Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that
(Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that)

Yeek yeek
(Whoop whoop!)
I ain't playin' around
Make one false move I'll take ya down
Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that
(Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that)

(Whoo!)
S-s-so c'mon c'mon
Don't get swung on, swung on
It's the knick-knack paddywhack, still ridin' Cadillacs
Family off the street made my homies put the baggies back
Still stackin' plaques (Yep)
Still action packed (Yep)
And dough, I keep it flippin' like acrobats
That's why I pack a mac, that'll crack 'em back
'Cause on my waist there's more heat than the Shaq attack

But I ain't speakin' about ballin', ballin'
Just thinkin' about brawlin' 'til y'all start bawlin'
We all in together now, birds of a feather now
Just bought a plane so we changin' the weather now
So put your brakes on, caps put your capes on
Or knock off your block
Get dropped and have your face flown
'Cause I'll prove it, scratch off the music
Like hey little stupid, don't make me lose it

Yeek yeek
(Whoop whoop!)
Why you all in my ear?
Talkin' a whole bunch of shit that I ain't tryin' to hear
Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that
(Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that)

Yeek yeek
(Whoop whoop!)
I ain't playin' around
Make one false move I'll take ya down
Get back motherfucker you don't know me like that
(Get back motherfucker you don't know me like that)

I came
(I came)
I saw
(I saw)
I hit 'em right dead in the jaw
(In the jaw)

I came
(I came)
I saw
(I saw)
I hit 'em right dead in the jaw
(In the jaw)

I came
(I came)
I saw
(I saw)
I hit 'em right dead in the jaw
(In the jaw)

I came
(I came)
I saw
(I saw)
I hit 'em right dead in the jaw
(In the jaw)

See I caught 'em wit a right hook
Caught 'em wit a jab
Caught 'em wit an uppercut
Kicked 'em in his ass
Sent him on his way 'cause I ain't for that talk
Ain't no trips to the county, I ain't for that walk
We split like two pins at the end of a lane
We'll knock out your spotlight and put an end to your fame
Put a DTP pendant at the end of yo chain
Then put the booty of a Swisha at the end of a flame

Yeek yeek
(Whoop whoop!)
Why you all in my ear?
Talkin' a whole bunch of shit that I ain't tryin' to hear
Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that
(Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that)

Yeek yeek
(Whoop whoop!)
I ain't playin' around
Make one false move I'll take ya down
Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that
(Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that)

Hey! You want what wit' me?
I'm a tell you one time, don't fuck wit me!
(Get down)
'Cause I ain't got nothin' to lose
And I'm havin' a bad day
Don't make me take it out on you

You want what wit me?
I'm a tell you one time, don't fuck wit me
(Get down)
'Cause I ain't got nothin' to lose
And I'm havin' a bad day
Don't make me take it out on you

Man, 'cause I don't wanna do that
I want to have a good time and enjoy my Jack
Sit back and watch the women get drunk as Hell
So I can wake up in the mornin' wit a story to tell
I know it's been a lil' while since I been out the house
But now I'm here you wanna stand around runnin' your mouth
I can't hear nothin' you sayin' or spittin', so what's up?
Don't you see we in the club, man, shut the fuck up

Yeek yeek
(Whoop whoop!)
Why you all in my ear?
Talkin' a whole bunch of shit that I ain't tryin' to hear
Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that
(Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that)

Yeek yeek
(Whoop whoop!)
I ain't playin' around
Make one false move I'll take ya down
Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that
(Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that)
