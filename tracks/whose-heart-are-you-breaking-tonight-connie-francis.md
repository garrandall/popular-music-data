Whose heart are you breaking tonight
Who's kissing and holding you tight
Who's looking in your eyes
And sighing helplessly
Who's listening to your lies
Those lies you told to me

I can't help but wonder somehow
Who's playing the fool for you now
While sleeping or waking
While my heart is aching
Whose heart are you breaking tonight

I can't help but wonder somehow
Who's playing the fool for you now
While sleeping or waking
While my heart is aching
Whose heart are you breaking tonight
