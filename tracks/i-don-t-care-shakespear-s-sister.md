Walking through the rooms in my head
I came across your image
You looked at me with that sweet smile and said
Something they won't let me repeat
We hurt the ones we love the most
It's a subtle form of compliment

I don't care if you talk about me
I don't care if you write it out in stone
Whenever I fall I land on my feet
I don't care, I just don't care

Mark the spot you hate with an x
Then shoot your bow and arrow
Do your worst get it all off your chest
I'll hold my breath and swallow
We hurt the ones we love the most
It's a subtle form of discipline

I don't care if you talk about me
I don't care if you write it out in stone
Whenever I fall I land on my feet
I don't care, I just don't care

I don't care if you act like a queen
I don't care if you take it out on me
I've got 9 lives and I land on my feet
I don't care, I just don't care

Out of the alley, I spoke came Victoria
Queen Victoria sitting shocked upon the rocking horse
Of a wave said to the laureate
This minx a course as sharp as any lynx
And blacker deeper than the drinks
As any hottentot without remorse
For the lynx said she and the drinks you can see
Are hot as any hottentot and not the goods for me
Hot as any hottentot and not the goods for me

I don't care if you talk about me
I don't care if you write it out in stone
Whenever I fall I land on my feet
I don't care, I just don't care

I don't care if you act like a queen
I don't care if you take it out on me
I've got 9 lives and I land on my feet
I don't care, I just don't care
