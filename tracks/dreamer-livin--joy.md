Til I loved you
I didn't know the meaning of the word.
I was only takin'
Giving nothing in return
My life was an empty page
Less than an even trade

Til I loved you
My heart was an island unto itself
I thought I needed no one
Til I looked into your eyes
I knew it all right then
I saw what a fool I'd been

Til I loved you (til I loved you)
I didn't know what I was missin'
Til I loved you
Taught me that dreamers don't need wings to fly

Til I loved you
I had never tasted tears of joy
When I take you in my arms
There's no doubt in my mind
This is where I belong
The loneliness is gone
I was livin' my life all wrong
Til I loved you
