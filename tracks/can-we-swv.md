Me and Timbaland we got the shot
That hits from here, from here to overseas
With SWV's, check it, one time
Ahah, ahah, ah see, umm
Me I'm Supa Fly, Supa Dupa Fly
Rub your hands up my thigh and go supa dupa high
Til you see my apple pie
Tell me if you like, tell me if you like


Baby got me, tipsy, tipsy
Off the Remy, your love, tasty, baby
You're sendin me, crazy, crazy
Can I be your lady
I love the things you say to me
I like it when you talkin' dir-tay


Can we get kinky tonight?
I got so many things on my mind
I never seen a guy so fine
I like it when you do me-do me
Can we get kinky tonight?
I got so many things on my mind
I wanna feel you squeeze me tight


Oh honey, got me, so high, so high
I can't lie, about the way you play me
If you want me, then take me
You sendin' me, crazy, crazy, baby
I love the way you taste me
Yes you taste me like pas-trayyyyy

Spend the night with me
Spend the night with me...
Spend the night with me
Don't care what we do
Just as long as I'm with you

Can we get kinky tonight?
Got so many things on my mind
Never seen a guy so fine
I like it when you do me-do me
Can we get kinky tonight?
I got so many things on my mind
I wanna feel you squeeze me tight


We could sit, in the back of my 300
We kissin' and we fondlin'
We high and we blunted
Take me if you want it to the Ho-Jo
Up all night like No-Doz
Yes I got the feelin', feel me blow
Don't ask me if I'm nasty
Freaky deaky
See, y'all can't see me
Me, Timbaland and SWVs
We hit you with the hee
Now shall we?
Hah-hah, check it out
