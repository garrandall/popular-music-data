People say i'm the life of the party
'cause I tell a joke or two
Although I may be laughin' loud and hearty
Deep inside i'm blue
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you, need you
Since you left me
If you see me with another girl
Seemin' like i'm havin' fun
Although she may be cute
She's just a substitute

Because you're the only one
So take a good look at my face
You see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you, need you
I'm masquerading
My hope is fading
Oh yeah, since you put me down
My smile is my makeup
I wear since my break-up with you
Baby take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
