Don't leave me this way
I can't survive
I can't stay alive
Without your love, no baby

Don't leave me this way
I can't exist
I will surely miss your tender kiss
So don't leave me this way

Oh baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
So come on down and do what you've got to do
Your started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning out of control
So come on down and satisfy the need in me
'Cos only your good loving can set me free

Don't leave me this way
I don't understand how I'm at your command
So baby please, so don't you leave me this way

Oh, baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
So come on down and do what you've got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning out of control
So come on down and satisfy the need in me
'Cos only your good loving can set me free
Set me free, set me free, set me free, set me free, set me free
Come, satisfy me, come satisfy me
Don't you leave me this way

Don't leave me this way
I can't exist, I will surely miss your tender kiss
So don't leave me this way

Oh, baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
So come on down and do what you've got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning out of control
So come on down and satisfy the need in me
'Cos only your good loving can set me free
Set me free, set me free, set me free, set me free, set me free

Don't you know by now, don't you know by now

I'm losing control
