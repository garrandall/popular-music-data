We had a good thing going
But it couldn't last
We had a good thing going
But now it's just a thing of the past

Love took a long time growing
But then it turned bad
You've got no way of knowing
Just how much I'm missing
All the love we had

Well, I know that you don't want me any longer, baby
But my love for you keeps getting stronger, baby
Even though you're gone, I can't keep from hanging on

'Cause we had a good thing going
So don't let it end
Let's save our love by showing
We can get that good thing going again

A good thing going
A good thing going
A good thing going

We had a good thing going
So don't let it end
We'll save our love by showing
We can get that good thing going again

We can get that good thing going again
We can get that good thing going again
We can get that good thing going again...
