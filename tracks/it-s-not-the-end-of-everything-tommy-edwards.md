Just because my love has gone
Don't think my life won't still go in
Because she wanted to have her fling
It's not the end of everything

The world still turns, the sun still shines
There's plenty of girls for hearts like mine
One never knows what tomorrow might bring
It's not the end of everything

Just look at the things I still possess
Like a heart that is filled with emptiness
And a life of pure unhappiness
Two arms that hold just loneliness

My room's overflowing with blue, blue songs
Oh, think of the nights I can spend all alone
And all the days I can just sit and dream
It's not the end of everything
(It's not the end of everything)

My room's overflowing with blue, blue songs
Oh, think of the nights I can spend all alone
And all the days I can just sit and dream
It's not the end of everything
