La la la la

Now that I've lost everything to you
You say you wanna start something new
And it's breaking my heart
You're leaving, baby, I'm grieving

But if you wanna leave, take good care
Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
But then a lot of nice things
Turn bad out there

(CHORUS)
Oh, baby baby, it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh, baby baby, it's a wild world
I'll always remember you like a child, girl

You know I've seen a lot
Of what the world can do
And it's breaking my heart in two
Because I never wanna see you
A sad girl, don't be a bad girl

But if you wanna leave
Take good care
Hope you make a lot
Of nice friends out there
But just remember there's
A lot of bad and beware

(CHORUS)

La la la la

But if you wanna leave
Take good care
Hope you make a lot
Of nice friends out there
But just remember there's
A lot of bad and beware

(CHORUS)

Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
And it's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh, baby baby, it's a wild world
And I'll always remember you
Like a child, girl
