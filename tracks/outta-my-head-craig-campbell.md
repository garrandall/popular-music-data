I rode around long enough
With my windows down
Let that breeze roll in, carry your perfume out
I took your number and messages off my phone
Oh, but you ain't gone

Wish I could close my eyes and not have to see you smiling
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
You're dancing all around it, girl you got me surrounded
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
I got you off these walls, I got you outta my bed
But girl I'm no better off, can't get you outta my head

It's like your memory, has got a map of my mind
No matter where I go, you find me every time
Alone or in a crowd, I hear you whispering baby
And it's driving me crazy

Wish I could close my eyes and not have to see you smiling
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
You're dancing all around it, girl you got me surrounded
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
I got you off these walls, I got you outta my bed
But girl I'm no better off, can't get you outta my head

Damn, you're hard to forget
Oh oh oh

Yeah, wish I could close my eyes and not have to see you smiling
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
You're dancing all around it, girl, you still got me surrounded
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
I got you off these walls, I got you outta my bed
But, girl, I'm no better off, can't get you outta my head
You're nowhere close to being gone outta my head

You ain't gon outta my head

Girl, outta my head

No you ain't gone
