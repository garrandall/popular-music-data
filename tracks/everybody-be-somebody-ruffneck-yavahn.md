Everybody Needs Somebody
Everybody Needs Somebody
We're so glad to see so many of you lovely people here tonight, and we
Would especially like to welcome all the representatives of Illinois'
Law enforcement community that have chosen to join us here in the
Palace Hotel Ballroom at this time. We sincerely hope that you enjoy
The show. And please remember people, no matter who you are, and
Whatever you do to live, thrive and survive, there are still some
Things that make us all the same: you, me, him, them -- everybody, everybody!
Everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs somebody to love
Someone to love (Someone to love)
Sweetheart to miss (Sweetheart to miss)
Sugar to kiss (Sugar to kiss)
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you in the morning
I need you, you, you when my soul's on fire
Sometimes I feel, I feel a little sad inside
When my baby mistreats me, I never never have a place to hide, I need you!
Sometimes I feel, I feel a little sad inside
When my baby mistreats me, I never never have a place to hide, I need you, you, you!
I need you, you, you!
I need you, you, you!
I need you, you, you!
You know people when you do find somebody, hold that woman, hold that
Man, love him, hold him, squeeze her, please her, hold, squeeze and
Please that person, give 'em all your love, signify your feelings with
Every gentle caress, because it's so important to have the special
Somebody to hold, kiss, miss, squeeze, and please
Everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs somebody to love
Someone to love (Someone to love)
Sweetheart to miss (Sweetheart to miss)
Sugar to kiss (Sugar to kiss)
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you in the morning
I need you, you, you when my soul's on fire
