At the dark end of the street
That's where we always meet
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong
Living in darkness to hide our wrongs
You and me at the dark end of the street
You and me


I know time is gonna take it's toll
We have to pay for the love that we stole
It's a sin and we know it's wrong
Oh, but our love keeps coming on strong
Steal away to the dark end of the street


They're gonna to find us
They're gonna to find us
They're gonna to find us
Lord, someday
You and me at the dark end of the street
You and me


And when the daylight hour rolls around
And by chance we're both downtown
If we should meet, just walk on by
Oh darling, please don't you cry
Tonight we'll meet at the dark end of the street
You and me
