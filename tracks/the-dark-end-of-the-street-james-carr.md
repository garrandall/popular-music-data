At the dark end of the street
That's where we'd always meet
Just in shadows where we don't belong
Living in darkness to hide our wrong

You and me at the dark end of the street
You and me

I know that time's gonna take its toll
We've got to give back all the love that we stole
It's a sin and we know it's wrong
Oh, but our love keeps coming on strong

You and me at the dark end of the street
Just you and me

They're going to find us
They're going to find us
They're going to find us someday
We steal away to the dark end of the street
You and me

If you take a walk downtown
If you should see me just walk on by
Oh, darling, please, don't cry

Tonight we'll meet at the dark end of the street
Just you and me

They're going to find us
They're going to find us
They're going to find us someday
We steal away to the dark end of the street
You and me
You and me
