I see you looking at me
Like I got something that's for you (Woo)
And the way that you stare, don't you dare
'Cause I'm not about to
Just give it all up to you
'Cause there are some things I won't do
And I'm not afraid to tell you I don't ever wanna leave you confused


The more you try
The less I bite
And I don't have to think it through
You know if I'm into you


I don't need a man to make it happen
I get off being free
I don't need a man to make me feel good
I get off doing my thing
I don't need a ring around my finger to make me feel complete
So, let me break it down
I can get off when you ain't around, oh


You know I got my own life and I bought everything that's in it
So, if you wanna be with me
It ain't all about the bling you bringing (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I want a love that's for real
And without that, no deal
And, baby, I don't need a hand if it only wants to grab one thing


The more you try
The less I bite
And I don't have to think it through
You know if I'm feeling you


I don't need a man to make it happen
I get off being free
I don't need a man to make me feel good
I get off doing my thing
I don't need a ring around my finger to make me feel complete
So, let me break it down
I can get off when you ain't around, oh


Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go (No, no, no)
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go


I don't need a...
I don't need a man, I don't, a...
I don't need a man to get me through
'Cause I'm doin' fine, I feel brand new
I don't need a...
I don't need a man, I don't
I don't need a man to make it through
'Cause I know I'm fine without you


I don't need a man to make it happen
I get off being free
I don't need a man to make me feel good
I get off doing my thing
I don't need a ring around my finger to make me feel complete
So, let me break it down
I can get off when you ain't around, oh


I don't need a man (I'm over you, yeah)
I don't need a man (Oh, I'm over you)
I don't need a man (I'm without you, I'm over you)
I don't need a man
I don't need a man
I don't need a man
Oh!
