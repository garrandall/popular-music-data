If you're reading this, my Momma's sitting there
Looks like I only got a one-way ticket over here
Sure wish I could give you one more kiss
And war was just a game we played when we were kids


I'm laying down my gun
I'm hanging up boots
I'm up here with God and we're both watching over you


So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul
Is where my momma always prayed
That it would go
And if you're reading this
I'm already home


If you're reading this
Halfway around the world
I won’t be there
To see the birth of our little girl
I hope she looks like you
I hope she fights like me
Stand up for the innocent and the weak


I'm laying down my gun
I'm hanging up boots
Tell dad I don't regret that I followed in his shoes


So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul
Is where my momma always prayed
That it would go
And if you're reading this
I'm already home


If you're reading this
There’s going to come a day
When you'll move on
And find someone else
And that's OK
Just remember this
I'm in a better place
Where soldiers live in peace
And angels sing amazing grace


So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul
Is where my momma always prayed
That it would go
And if you're reading this
If you're reading this
I'm already home
