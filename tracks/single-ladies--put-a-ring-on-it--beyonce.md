All the single ladies (all the single ladies)
All the single ladies (all the single ladies)
All the single ladies (all the single ladies)
All the single ladies
Now put your hands up

Up in the club, we just broke up
I'm doing my own little thing
You decided to dip but now you wanna trip
'Cause another brother noticed me
I'm up on him, he up on me
Don't pay him any attention
'Cause I cried my tears
For three good years
Ya can't be mad at me

'Cause if you like it then you should have put a ring on it
If you like it then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it then you should've put a ring on it

Whoa uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh
Whoa uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh

If you like it then you should have put a ring on it
If you like it then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it then you should've put a ring on it

I got gloss on my lips, a man on my hips
Hold me tighter than my Dereon jeans
Acting up, drink in my cup
I can't care less what you think
I need no permission, did I mention
Don't pay him any attention
'Cause you had your turn
And now you gonna learn
What it really feels like to miss me

'Cause if you like it then you should have put a ring on it
If you like it then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it then you should've put a ring on it

Whoa uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh
Whoa uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh

If you like it then you should have put a ring on it
If you like it then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it then you should've put a ring on it

Whoa uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh
Whoa uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh

Don't treat me to these things of the world
I'm not that kind of girl
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve
Here's a man that makes me then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms
Say I'm the one you want
If you don't, you'll be alone
And like a ghost I'll be gone

All the single ladies (all the single ladies)
All the single ladies (all the single ladies)
All the single ladies (all the single ladies)
All the single ladies
Now put your hands up

Whoa uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh
Whoa uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh

If you like it then you should have put a ring on it
If you like it then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it then you should've put a ring on it

Whoa uh oh

If you like it then you should have put a ring on it
If you like it then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it then you should've put a ring on it

Whoa uh oh
