Chris Brown, you set it off


Oh, feeling crazy
The moon is up
The night is hazy
Let's get lost in the shadows
Somewhere we can go
And no one else can find

Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body baby come undone
Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body baby come undone

Oh my my, looking like a good good time
Don't disguise
The way you wanna love tonight
Oh my my, hook you with a brand new high
Don't be shy, I just wanna live tonight
Live a little F.U.N. fun


Fresh from Monaco
Performing for Microsoft
Miami to L.A., G4, we takin' off
I'm a hard worker, I'm far from the boss
But when it's said and done, I'm owning it all
I know you think it's just rap
Just this, just that, ha ha right
Now baby, this my life
Wanna have fun for a night?
Then just


Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body baby come undone
Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body baby come undone

Oh my my, looking like a good good time
Don't disguise
The way you wanna love tonight
Oh my my, hook you with a brand new high
Don't be shy, I just wanna live tonight
Live a little F.U.N. fun


Co-headlining on tour with Enrique
Often casa campo, who would've thought de que
Down in Key Largo, you know I'm on that sticky
Icky, icky, icky, icky
Don't do it much, but when I do I'm gone
Don't take it all off, keep your heels and thong
Ah Mami that turns me on, now just listen to the song and


Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body baby come undone
Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body baby come undone

Oh my my, looking like a good good time
Don't disguise
The way you wanna love tonight
Oh my my, hook you with a brand new high
Don't be shy, I just wanna live tonight
Live a little F.U.N. fun

Come on Mami, you know what it is
Come on baby, you know what it is
I wanna uh, let's go to the crib
And if you want you can bring your friends
Come on Mami, you know what it is
Come on baby, you know what it is
I wanna uh, let's go to the crib
And if you want you can bring your friends
And we can F.U.N. fun


Let's go!
Let's ride!
Let's show em how we do it in the 305


Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body baby come undone
Loosen up your body 'til you come undone
Loosen up your body baby come undone
