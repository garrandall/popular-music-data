Do do do do...

Til the end of time
Long as stars are in the blue
Long as there's a
Spring of birds to sing
I'll go on loving you

Til the end of time
Long as roses bloom in May
My love for you will grow deeper
With every passing day

Til the wells run dry
And each mountain disappears
I'll be there for you
To care for you through
Laughter and through tears

So take my heart in sweet surrender
And tenderly say that I'm
The one you love and live for
Til the end of time

Til the wells run dry
And each mountain disappears
I'll be there for you
To care for you through
Laughter and through tears

So take my heart in sweet surrender
And tenderly say that I'm
The only one you love
The only one you love
Til the end of time
