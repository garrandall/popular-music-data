It's over, well over
In my mind and in my heart
It's over, well over
But then again it didn't have a good start

You'd tell me, try to sell me
It could have been all I asked
It's over, well over
It's there and flows away
A distant past


Now it's a long dark road
Yes, a long dark road
And you know I loved you
Yes, you know I loved you



It's over, well over
And we can't revive what's past
It's gone now, moved on now
But then again it didn't have a chance to last
No, no, no, a chance to last
