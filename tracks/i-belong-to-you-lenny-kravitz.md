You are the flame in my heart 
You light my way in the dark 
You are the ultimate star 

You lift me from up above 
Your unconditional love 
Takes me to paradise 

I belong to you 
And you 
You belong to me too 

You make my life complete 
You make me feel so sweet 

You make me feel so divine 
Your soul and mind are entwined 
Before you I was blind 

But since I've opened my eyes 
And with you there's no disguise 
So I could open up my mind 

I always loved you from the start 
But I could not figure out 
That I had to do it everyday 

So I put away the fight 
Now I'm gonna live my life 
Giving you the most in every way 

I belong to you 
And you 
You belong to me too 

You make my life complete 
You make me feel so sweet 

Oh I belong to you 
I belong to you 
And you, you 
You belong to me too 

You make my life complete 
You make me feel so sweet 

Oh I belong to you 
I belong to you 
And you, you 
You belong to me too 

You make my life complete 
You make my life complete 
You make me feel so sweet 

Oh I belong to you 
I belong to you 
And you, and you 
You belong to me too 

You make my life complete 
You make my life complete 
You make me feel so sweet
