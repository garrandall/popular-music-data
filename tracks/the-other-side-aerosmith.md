Mm mm mm, mm mm mm, mm mm mm,
mm mm mm mm mm, Yeah
Come on.


Lovin' you has go to be (take me to the other side)
Like the devil and the deep blue sea (take me to the other side)
Forget about your foolish pride (take me to the other side)
Oh take me to the other side (take me to the other side)

My mamma told me there'd be days like this
And man she wasn't foolin'
'Cause I just can't believe the way you kiss
Uh uh huh
You opened up your mouth with baited breath
You said you'd never leave me.
You love me, you hate me, I tried to take the loss
You're cryin' me a river but I got to get across



I'm lookin' for another kind of love
Oh Lordy, how I need it.
The kind that likes to leap without a shove
Oh, honey, best believe it.
To save a lot of time and foolish pride I'll say what's on my mind, girl
You loved me, you hate me, you cut me down to size.
You blinded me with love and yeah it opened up my eyes

Lovin' you has got to be (take me to the other side)
like the devil and the deep blue sea (take me to the other side)
My conscience got to be my guide (take me to the other side)
Oh honey take me, take, take, take, take, take

Take me to the other side
I'm lookin' for another kind of love
Oh Lordy, how I need it.
The kind that likes to leap without a shove
Honey, best you believe it.
Now I ain't one for sayin' long goodbyes.
I hope all is forgiven
You loved me, you hate me, I used to be your lover
You know you had it comin' girl so take me to the other side
Take me to the other side, take me to the other side

Lovin' you has got to be (take me to the other side)
like the devil and the deep blue sea (take me to the other side)
My conscience got to be my guide (take me to the other side)
Oh honey take me to the other side
