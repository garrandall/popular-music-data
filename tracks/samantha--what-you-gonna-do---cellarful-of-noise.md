Tell me what you gonna do
What you gonna do, oh
What you gonna do
What you gonna do, oh

The ticking of the clock is the countdown

Samantha rises
Puts her school clothes on
Her doctor, doctor
Is the only one in town
Rumors like this
Are gonna spill all around

Love, love, love, love's power
She carries you with love so dear
Love, love, love, love's power
So tiny, it would drown in a tear

Tell me what you gonna do
What you gonna do, oh
Samantha, Samantha
Tell me what you gonna do
What you gonna do, oh
Samantha, Samantha

The fate of it
She knows she must decide
Tomorrow's when she cries
Tomorrow's when she cries
But where in the world
Does tomorrow lie
For the tiny heart that's beating
Inside

Love, love, love, love's power
It was just an unlucky mistake
Love, love, love, love's power
The toughest choice for a woman to make

Tell me what you gonna do
What you gonna do, oh
Samantha, Samantha
Tell me what you gonna do
What you gonna do, oh
Samantha, Samantha, whoa

On one hand, she thinks
That it deserves something more
Samantha, it'll be all right
But on the other hand, yeah
She just isn't sure

Tell me what you gonna do
What you gonna do, oh
Samantha, Samantha
Tell me what you gonna do
What you gonna do, oh
Samantha, Samantha, whoa

Tell me what you gonna do
What you gonna do, oh
Samantha, Samantha
Tell me what you gonna do
What you gonna do, oh
Samantha, Samantha, whoa

Tell me what you gonna do
What you gonna do, oh
Samantha, Samantha
Tell me what you gonna do
What you gonna do, oh
Samantha, Samantha, whoa

The ticking of the clock
Is a chilling sound
