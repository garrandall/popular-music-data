Caroline! Caroline!
See Caroline all the guys would say she's mighty fine
But mighty fine only got you somewhere half the time
And the other half either got you cursed out, or coming up short
Yeah, now dig this, now even though

You'd need a golden calculator to divide
The time it took to look inside and realize that
Real guys go for real down to Mars girls, ha ha yeah!


I know you'd like to thank your shit don't stank
But lean a little bit closer
See that roses really smell like boo-boo
Yeah, roses really smell like boo-boo


Caroline! See she's the reason for the word "bitch"
I hope she's speeding on the way to the club
Trying to hurry up to get to some
Baller or singer or somebody like that
And try to put on her makeup in the mirror
And crash, crash, crash into a ditch! (just playing!)

She needs a golden calculator to divide
The time it took to look inside and realize
That real guys go for real down to Mars girls, yeah!

Well she's got a hottie body, but her attitude is potty
When I met her at a party she was hardly acting naughty
I said, "Shorty, would you call me?"
She said, "Pardon me, are you ballin'?"
I said, "Darling, you sound like a prostitute pursing."
Oh so you're one them freaks, get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game been peeped, dropping names she's weak
Trickin' off this bitch is lost
Must take me for a geek a quick way to eat
A neat place sleep, a rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat
Now go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless, we don't want to get involved with no lawyers
And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom
I wanna see ya support bra not support you!



Better come back down to Mars
Girl, quit chasin' cars
What happens when the dough gets low
Bitch, you ain't that fine
No way, no way, no way


Crazy bitch
Bitch, stupid ass bitch
Old punk ass bitch, old dumb ass bitch
A bitch's bitch, just a bitch
