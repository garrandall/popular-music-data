There ain't no hidden treasure, in this pot of gold you see
Ain't no way you're going to make, no silk purse outta me
Well I'm never ever gonna change your ways, I'll take you as you are
You got something that I want, and that's a way to start


What you see is what you get, and you ain't seen nothing yet
What you see is what you get, and you ain't seen nothing yet


I told you that I loved you, right from the very start
Now don't you make me start again, baby and open up my heart
Well I know that I'm no angel, can say my first time out
But you can count on what I've got, 'cause what I've got's enough


What you see is what you get, and you ain't seen nothing yet
What you see is what you get, and you ain't seen nothing yet


When it's cold I want it hot, I've always wanted what it not
But when it comes to loving you, I'm yours no matter what you do
Oh, you're my baby, I'm your man, this is not an angel's plan
Can't you see it, it's a fact, loving you is where it's at


What you see is what you get, and you ain't seen nothing yet
What you see is what you get, and you ain't seen nothing yet
What you see is what you get, and you ain't seen nothing yet
What you see is what you get, and you ain't seen nothing yet
What you see is what you get, and you ain't seen nothing yet
What you see is what you get, and you ain't seen nothing yet
