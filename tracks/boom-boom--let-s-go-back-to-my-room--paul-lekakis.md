Hey baby I'd like to talk to you
How about coming back to my room for a little boom boom

You keep coming to me
I can dig your dynamite
Know the way you move
Get in the groove
You're driving me crazy, crazy for you

Second time you moved me
It's time for us to Boom Boom
You can come right close to me
And feel the burning fire
All the time you got me
It's fine for us to boom boom
If you see the spark in me
And feel my strong desire

Boom Boom Boom
Let's go back to my room
So we can do it all night
And you can make me feel right

Boom Boom Boom
Let's go back to my room
So we can do it all night
And you can make me feel right

Do the honor to me
Don't you know I like to bite
Get to the view
Closer to you
You're driving me crazy, crazy for you

Second time you moved me
It's time for us to Boom Boom
You can come right close to me
And feel the burning fire
All the time you got me
It's fine for us to boom boom
If you see the spark in me
And feel my strong desire

Boom Boom Boom
Let's go back to my room
So we can do it all night
And you can make me feel right

Boom Boom Boom
Let's go back to my room
So we can do it all night
And you can make me feel right
