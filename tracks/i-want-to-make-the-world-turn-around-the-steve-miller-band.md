I don't want to live in a world of darkness
I want to live in a world of light
I don't want to live in a world that's heartless
I want to live in a world of sight
Well you know, I want to make the world turn around

Living in a world of justice
Living in a world of shame
Living in a world of freedom
Living in a world of pain
Well you know, I want to make the world turn around

Turn the darkness into light
Turn the hunger into life
Turn the wrong into right
Put an end to the strife
Turn the blindness into sight
Save a human life
Make the world turn around

I want to live in a world of gladness
I want to know what your heart is made of
Don't want to live in a world of sadness
I want to live in a world of love
Well you know, I want to make the world turn around

Living in a world of justice
Living in a world of light
Living in a world of freedom
Living in a world of sight

I want to send a message
To every boy and girl
I want to send a message
About the world
We got to build it up
Stop tearing it down
We got to build it up
Make the world turn around
