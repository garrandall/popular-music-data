Wonder-wonder-wonderful you
Oh what a wonder just being under
Moonlight when the night is new
But I am betting it's just the setting
For the wonder that is you.

Dreams are a wonder
Now that I understand
Simply by seeing and always being
With the wonder that is you

Wonder-wonder-wonderful you
Wonder-wonder-wonderful you.
Wonder if you dear
Want to be true dear
Just to me your whole life through
Wonderful lifetime man and wife-time
With the wonder that is you.
