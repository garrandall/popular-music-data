They say he doesn't love me
But they don't know
He makes me feel so happy when I'm feeling low
My friends just can't seem to see
That he means the world to me

And that is why I adore him
(He's everything, everything to me)
Oh, I adore him
(He's all that a boy, all a boy should be)
Yes, I adore him
(Sometimes he hurts, he hurts my pride)
Do anything for him
(But he's so good, so good inside)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

When we're with other people
He treats me when
But when we're off together
Oh, you know, I'm his queen
Though, sometimes when I cry at night
He makes things turn out alright

And that is why I adore him
(He's everything, everything to me)
Oh, I adore him
(He's all that a boy, all a boy should be)
Yes, I adore him
(Sometimes he hurts, he hurts my pride)
Do anything for him
(But he's so good, so good inside)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

When we walk hand in hand
Through the roughest part of town
I never feel afraid
Knowing he's around

He maybe cheating on me
But I don't care
Cause when I need his loving
He's always there
I can't help but wonder why
I've been blessed with such a guy

And that is why I adore him
(He's everything, everything to me)
Oh, I adore him
(He's all that a boy, all a boy should be)
Yeah, yeah, I love him so
(Sometimes he hurts, he hurts my pride)
You know I'll never, never, never let him go
(But he's so good, so good inside)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
He's mine
(He's everything, everything to me)
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna love him all the time
(He's all that a boy, all a boy)
