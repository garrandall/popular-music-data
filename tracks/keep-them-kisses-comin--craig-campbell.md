You got your hair down
You got that look in your eye
That says come here and get me boy
Lay me down and love me just right, yeah
Ainât goin no where
I got a bottle of wine
I got nothinâ but time on my hands
And Iâm gonna be your man tonight, ah yes I am

 
I canât imagine doinâ nothin but what Iâm doin
Just layinâ round tangled up with you
We got our buzz on sippinâ on a little something
I need your lovinâ
Just keep them kisses cominâ

Itâs been a long week
Iâve been missinâ me some you
All I wanna do is get your lips on mine 
Girl if you only knew, hey

 
I canât imagine doinâ nothin but what Iâm doin
Just layinâ round tangled up with you
We got our buzz on sippinâ on a little something
I need your lovinâ
Just keep them kisses cominâ
Yeah keep âem cominâ all night

Donât stop killinâ me baby
Donât stop drivinâ me crazy
I swear thereâs honey on your lips
Baby give me one more long slow kiss

 
I canât imagine doinâ nothin but what Iâm doin
Just layinâ round tangled up with you
We got our buzz on sippinâ on a little something
I need your lovinâ
Just keep them kisses cominâ
Oh keep âem cominâ all night, hey
