Every time I see that Greyhound Bus go rollin’ down the line
Makes me wish I talked much more to you
When we had all that time

Still, it’s only wishin’ and I know it’s nothing more, so I’m
Never going back, never going back, never going back
Ah, to Nashville anymore

Oklahoma City, yes I know that she won’t treat me cruel
Denver Colorado never made me feel like such a fool
These are only cities, but they’re cities without you. So I’m

Never going back, never going back, never going back
Ah, to Nashville anymore

Still, it’s only wishin’ and I know it’s nothing more, so I’m
Never going back, never going back, never going back
Ah, to Nashville (Nashville) anymore

Every time I see that Greyhound Bus go rollin’ down the line
(Never going back.)
Kinda makes me wish I talked much more to you
When we had all that time
(Never going back.)
Oklahoma City, yes I know that she won’t treat me cruel
(Never going back.)
