Every time I see that Greyhound Bus go rollinâ down the line,
Makes me wish I talked much more to you
When we had all that time.

Still, itâs only wishinâ and I know itâs nothing more, so Iâm
Never going back, never going back, never going back, 
Ah, to Nashville anymore.

Oklahoma City, yes I know that she wonât treat me cruel.
Denver Colorado never made me feel like such a fool.
These are only cities, but theyâre cities without you. So Iâm

Never going back, never going back, never going back, 
Ah, to Nashville anymore.

Still, itâs only wishinâ and I know itâs nothing more, so Iâm
Never going back, never going back, never going back, 
Ah, to Nashville (Nashville) anymore.

Every time I see that Greyhound Bus go rollinâ down the line,
(Never going back.)
Kinda makes me wish I talked much more to you
When we had all that time.
(Never going back.)
Oklahoma City, yes I know that she wonât treat me cruel.
(Never going back.)
