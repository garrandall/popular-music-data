Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeers pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing, children singing, all is merry and bright
So hang your stockings and say your prayers, 'cause Santa Claus comes tonight


Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane
He's got a bag that's filled with toys for boys and girls again
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle, oh what a beautiful sight
So jump in bed and cover your head, 'cause Santa Claus comes tonight


Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane
He doesn't care if you're rich or poor, he loves you just the same
Santa Claus knows we're all God's children, that makes everything right
So fill your hearts with Christmas cheer, 'cause Santa Claus comes tonight


Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane
He'll come around when chimes ring out that it's Christmas morn' again
Peace on Earth will come to all if we just follow the light
So let's give thanks to the lord above, 'cause Santa Claus comes tonight


Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeers pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing, children singing, all is merry and bright
Hang your stockings and say your prayers, 'cause Santa Claus comes tonight
