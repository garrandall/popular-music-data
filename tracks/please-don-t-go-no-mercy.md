Please don't go
Please don't go

Don't you know that I love you so
Say you're mine
And give me tonight
Let's stay together

Please don't go
Please don't go

You're the only angel I know
You were sent from heaven above
To love me forever

Don't go
Don't go

If you leave me, you'll let a good thing fall apart
If you deceive me, you'll leave a pain inside my heart
I really need you, just like the air I need to breathe
I'll stand beside you, I'll never leave

Please don't go
Please don't go

Don't you know that I love you so
Say you're mine
And give me tonight
Let's stay together

Please don't go
Please don't go

You're the only angel I know
You were sent from heaven above
To love me forever

Don't go
Don't go

If you leave me, you're gonna spoil a dream we share
If you leave me, I'm gonna miss the way you cared
I will try harder, I'll make you fall in love again
And I'll be faithful, until the end

Please don't go
Please don't go

You're the only angel I know
You were sent from heaven above
To love me forever

Don't go
Don't go

Don't go

If you leave me, I'm gonna search the world for you
If you leave me, sweet memories will shine on through

Please don't go, please don't go
Don't you know that I love you so
Say you're mine and give me tonight
Let's stay togheter.

Please don't go, please don't go
You're the only angel I know
You were sent from heaven above
To love me forever.

Don't go
Don't go
