I don't like cities
But I like New York


The famous places to visit are so many


Other places make me feel like a dork


I told my grandpa I wouldn't miss on any


Los Angeles is for people who sleep


Got to see the whole town
Right from Yonkers on down to the Bay


Paris and London
Oh baby you can keep


Baby you can keep


Baby you can keep


Other cities always make me mad
Other places always make me sad
No other city ever made me glad
Except New York, New York
It's the old New York!
I love New York (New York, New York)
I love New York (New York, New York)


If you don't like my attitude
Then you can get lost


Manhattan women


Are dressed in silk and satin


Just go to Texas


Isn't that where they golf


There's just one thing that's


Important in Manhattan


New York is not for little wussies who scream (AAA!)


Pick up a date
Maybe seven
Or eight


Paris and London
Oh baby you can keep


Baby you can keep


Baby you can keep!


Other cities always make me mad ( Make me mad)
Other places always make me sad ( Make me sad)
No other city ever made me glad
Except New York, New York
It's the old New York!
I love New York (New York, New York)
I love New York (New York, New York)


We've sailed the seas
And we've been the world over
Made the Mandalay
We've seen the Sphinx
And we've seen the Cliffs of Dover
And we can safely say


New York!


Other cities always make me mad ( Ooow!)
Other places always make me sad ( New York!)
No other city ever made me glad
Except New York, New York
It's the old New York!
I love New York (New York, New York)
I love New York ( New York, New York)
(New York, New York)
I love New York (New York, New York)
 New York, New York


New York, New York!!
