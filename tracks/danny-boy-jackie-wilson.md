Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen and down the mountainside
The summer's gone and all the roses falling
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide

Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen and even down the mountainside
The summer's gone and all the roses falling
It's you, it's you must go and I must abide

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and even white with snow
It's I'll be there in sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so

Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen and even down the mountainside
The summer's gone and all the roses falling
It's you, it's you must go and I must abide

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
And when the valley's hushed and even white with snow
It's I'll be there in sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so

Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so
