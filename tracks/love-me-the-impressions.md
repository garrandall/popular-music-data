Ah ah ah hah hah hah
Just to see you
And to hear, your voice alone
And with your company
Knowing that, our love is strong
Just these few things my dear
You don't what they mean to me
For your precious love
It means everything to me
Ah ah ah hah hah hah

And darling, all my life I've wanted this
All of my life of, love and happiness
And then you came along
And made my loneliness a song
And that's why I'm singing
Ah ah ah hah hah hah

For as long as you, as long as you
As you love me (love me)
C'mon and love me (love me)
Want you to love me (love me)
That you love me
I'll keep on singing, ah ah ah ah ah ah
Keep on singing, ah ah ah ah ah ah
Eh-oh
Woo woo woo woo woo
Eh-oh
