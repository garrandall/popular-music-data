Can I cry a little bit 
There's nobody to notice it 
Can I cry if I want to 
No one cares 

Why can't I pretend 
That you love me again? 
All I had has been taken from me 
Now I'm cryin' 
And tears don't become me 

Just one smile, 
Pain's forgiven 
Just one kiss, girl 
Now the hurt's all gone 
Just one smile to make my,
Make my little life worth livin' 
A little dream to build my world upon 

How I wish 
I could say 
All the things that I forgot to say 
How I wish you 
Could see what's here 
In My heart 
I don't ask for much 
A look, a smile, a touch 
Try to forget 
Well, the Lord knows I'm tryin' 
But it's so hard to forget girl, 
When your whole world is dyin' 

Just one smile, 
Pain's forgiven 
Just one kiss, girl 
Now the hurt's all gone 
Just one smile to make my,
Make my little life worth livin' 
A little dream to build my world upon

Try to forget 
Well, the Lord knows I'm tryin' 
But it's so hard to forget girl, 
When your whole world is dyin' 

Just one smile, 
Pain's forgiven 
Just one kiss, girl 
Now the hurt's all gone 
Just one smile to make my,
Make my little life worth livin' 
A little dream to build my world upon
