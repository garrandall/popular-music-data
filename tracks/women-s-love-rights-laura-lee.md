Hey, hear me girls
Oh, stand up
To all the women liberators
And men sympathizers
I thank you
For I'm Laura Lee
I'm starting a new movement today
For women's love rights

Stand up and fight
For your love rights
Love who you wanna
'Cause a man is sure gonna

Stand up girls
(Stand up and fight)
For your love rights
(For your love rights)
Love who you wanna
'Cause a man is sure gonna

We do the washing
We cook and sew
Babies tie you down
While your man is on the go

Girls
You gotta right
(Yes we do)
Go out at night
Sitter's all around
To let you paint the town

Girls
Stand up and fight
For your love rights
Love who you wanna
'Cause a man's sure gonna

Stand up and fight
For your love rights
Love who you wanna
'Cause a man is sure gonna

Listen
We love one man
(Yes we do)
Trying to be fair
He's got three women
A pair, and a spare
He loves who he pleases
While you're at home in need
That's unsatisfaction
A piece of the action

Stand up and fight, girls
For your love rights
Love who you wanna
'Cause a man is sure gonna

Stand up and fight, girls
For your love rights
Love who you wanna
'Cause a man is sure gonna

(Love rights)
I'm here to tell you about it girls
Talking 'bout love rights
A few of your love rights

One
You've got a stake
In all he owns and makes
Two
Money he can't claim
Into faking your own name
Three
Be taking out to eat
At least once a week
Four
A set of car keys
To go when you please
(It ain't no question)
And when you window shop, girls
In your favorite spot
(Get some satisfaction)
Don't just cry at home
Buy it, take it home

Love rights
Talking 'bout love rights
(Talking 'bout your love rights, girl)
Stand up and fight girls
For your love rights

You gotta love who you wanna
'Cause a man is sure gonna
Girls, stand up and fight
For your love rights
You can love who you wanna
'Cause a man is sure gonna

Girls, stand up and fight
For your love rights
Love who you wanna
'Cause a man is sure gonna
