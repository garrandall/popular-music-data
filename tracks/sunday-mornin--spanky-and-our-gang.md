Sunday mornin' (Sunday mornin')
Sun shinin' on your eyes, sleepy face
Smilin' a smile, Sunday mornin' (sit down)
Lots of time with nothin' to do
Lots of time to spend with you (Sunday mornin')
On Sunday mornin', Sunday mornin'
It's so quiet in the street
You can hear the sound of feet walkin' by
I'll put the coffee on to brew
We can have a cup or two
And do what other people do on Sunday mornin'
Sunday mornin', Sunday mornin', Sunday, Sunday, I love Sunday

Sunday mornin', come hold me in your arms
(I love you, everything's all right)
Lots of time, lots of time, lots of time with nothin' to do
Lots of time to spend with you (on Sunday mornin')
On Sunday mornin' (Sunday mornin')
Sunday mornin'.. it's so quiet in the street
We can hear the sound of feet walkin' by
I'll put coffee on to brew
We can have a cup or two
And do what other people do
On Sunday mornin'. . . mornin',Yeah!

Sunday mornin', Sunday mornin'
Sunday, Sunday, I love Sunday
Sunday mornin. . 
C'mon, hold me in your arms (I love you)
C'mon, everything's all right (Sunday mornin')
Everything's all right (Sunday mornin')
Everything's all right (Sunday mornin')
Everything's all right (Sunday mornin')
Everything's all right . . 

(On Sunday, mornin', Sunday mornin' Sunday
Sunday, Sunday,mornin', Sunday, mornin, mornin
On Sunday mornin', lot's of time with nothin' to do
Sunday mornin', lot's of time to spend with you
Mornin', Sunday, mornin'. . . . . . . )
