Whoa, chills and fever
Whoa, chills and fever
Oh, chills and fever
Chills and fever, don't you give to me

When you hold my hand
Tell me that I'm your lovin' man
Kiss me and squeeze me tight
Tell me, babe, you want to love all night

I get, whoa, chills and fever
Whoa, chills and fever
Oh, chills and fever
Chills and fever don't you give to me

When it's late at night
And, and when you hold me tight
Tell me that you love me so
That you'll never ever ever let me go

I get, whoa, chills and fever
Whoa, chills and fever
Oh, chills and fever
Chills and fever don't you give to me



You call me late at night
And I'll come running, rain or shine
Tell you that I love you so
And I'll never ever ever let you go

I get, whoa, chills and fever
Whoa, chills and fever
Oh, chills and fever
Chills and fever don't you give to me

Oh, whoa, oh, yes, chills and fever, baby
Um hum
