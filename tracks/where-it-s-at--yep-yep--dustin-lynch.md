It ain’t in a high rise looking for a good time shutting down the city lights
It ain’t in the water floating like a bobber soaking up that hot sunshine
As good as it gets, no that ain’t where it is


It’s at 2 A.M. when she's reaching over
Faded T-shirt hanging off her shoulder
Dressed up, hair down, in a ball cap
Yep Yep, as long as I get that
Sweet little something late night kiss
On a plane or a train or way back in the sticks
I swear, if she's there, that’s where
Yep yep, that's where it's at


It ain’t in a suped-up shiny red new truck, if she ain’t to my right
It ain’t in a dive bar, tall can of PBR, poppin' tops rockin' all night
As good as it gets, no, that ain’t where it is


It’s at 2 A.M. when she's reaching over
Faded T-shirt hanging off her shoulder
Dressed up, hair down, in a ball cap
Yep Yep, as long as I get that
Sweet little something late night kiss
On a plane or a train or way back in the sticks
I swear, if she's there, that’s where
Yep yep, that's where it's at


No, it don’t matter wherever we’re at (no)
No, it don’t get no better than that
It ain’t in a suped-up shiny red new truck, if she ain’t to my right


It’s at 2 A.M. when she's reaching over
Faded T-shirt hanging off her shoulder
Dressed up, hair down, in a ball cap
Yep Yep, as long as I get that
Sweet little something late night kiss
On a plane or a train or way back in the sticks
I swear, if she's there, that’s where
Yep yep, that's where it's at


Yeah, that’s where it’s at
Yep, yep, (that’s where it’s at)
2 A.M. when she’s reaching’ over
Faded t-shirt hanging off her shoulder (that’s where it’s at)
