So he told you that you're the dream
That he's been searching for
And he told you, he's never met
Someone like you before

And I can hear him telling you
Your lips taste just like cherry wine
But did he tell you
That he's known as JOHNNY ONE TIME

Did he tell you that your heart
Would soon become another trinket
On his bracelet of broken heats

Did he tell you that the morning sun
Would find you patching up your shattered pride
And searching for the missing parts

Did he tell you that the special love you're saving
Will disappear in flames
Shaped like mine

Did he tell you
That he's Know as
JOHNNY ONE TIME

So he told you
That he'd never lead your heart astray
And he told you that he'd love you
Forever and a day

And I can hear him telling you
That he's a shy and bashful kind
But did he tell you that he's known as
JOHNNY ONE TIME

Oh did he tell you that your heart
Would soon become another trinket
On his bracelet of broken heats

Did he tell you that the morning sun
Would find you patching up your shattered pride
And searching for the missing parts

Did he tell you that the special love you're saving
Will disappear in flames
Shaped like mine

Did he tell you
That he's Know as
JOHNNY ONE TIME
