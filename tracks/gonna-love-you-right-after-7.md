Chorus:
Gonna love you right
Gonna take my time with you
Gonna love you slow
Can't get enough of you
Gonaa love you right
Gonna take my time with you
Gonna love you over and over and over again

Some people live saerching for love
And some don't believe no more
I've been on both sides
And I'm thankful because you're fine
'cause it feels good to hold you
And each time you tell me you'll be here the rest of my life


Some people mistreat a specail love
Find it hard to stop doing wrong
They don't miss they're well
Til they're water starts running dry
But I'll do what I can
To be a good man

Don't wanna hear no more your goodbyes


Everybody needs someone to love
Gotta take my love kiss stars I've got the chance to love you
Eveybody needs someone to hold tight
As long as I've got you I'm gonna do it right
Wanna love, need a love, gotta love, wanna love need a love, gotta love you


Love you right
Take my time
Doin it slow
Love you right
Take my time
Doin it slow
Never gonna love a girl the way I loved you baby
Doin it slow
Love you right
Tse my time
Doin it slow
