Ask for money
And get advice.
Ask for advice,
Get money twice.
I'm from the dirty
But that chico nice.
Y'all call it a moment.
I call it life.


One day while my light
Is glowin',
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open,
I just want to
Feel this moment
Whoa, whoa oh oh
I just want to
Feel this moment
Whoa, whoa oh oh
I just want to
Feel this moment


Mr. worldwide...
Christina aguilera
Oye mamita... (come on)
Dale que la cosa esta rica.


I just want to feel this moment


Whoo!...
Yeah!...
Feel this moment.

Reporting live
From the tallest building in tokyo
Long way from them hard ways
Filled with zoes and oyes
Dade county always
3 0 5 all day
Now, baby, we can parley
Or, baby, we can party, ha
She read books, especially
About red rooms and tie-ups
I got her hooked
'Cause she see me in a suit
With the red tie tied up
Meet and greets,
Nice to meet ya
But time is money
Only difference is I own it
Now let's stop time
And enjoy this moment,


One day while my light
Is glowin',
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open,
I just want to
Feel this moment
Whoa, whoa oh oh
 Come on!

I just want to
Feel this moment
Whoa, whoa oh oh
 Ha! yeah!

I just want to feel
This moment


Whoo!...
Ha! yeah!...
Come on!
Feel this moment.

I see the future
But live for the moment
Makes sense, don't it? ha
Now make dollars,
I mean billions
I'm a genius,
I mean brilliant
The streets are what schooled
Him and made him slicker
Than slick rick the ruler
I've lost a lot
And learned a lot
But I'm still undefeated
Like shula
I'm far from cheap (ha-ha)
I break down companies with
All my peeps (that's right)
Baby, we can travel the world
And I can give you
And all you can see
Time is money
Only difference is I own it
Like a stopwatch,
Let's stop time
And enjoy this moment...


One day while my light
Is glowin',
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open,
I just want to
Feel this moment
Whoa, whoa oh oh
 Come on!

I just want to
Feel this moment
Oh, oh oh oh
I just want to feel
This moment


Whoo!...
Yeah!...
Come on!
Feel this moment.


Whoa, whoa oh oh
I just want to
Feel this moment
Whoa, whoa oh oh
I just want to feel
This moment.
