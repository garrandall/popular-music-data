If you're tied up, you'd better stay tied up
Cause it's cheaper to keep her
This is from T, who says

It's cheaper to keep her
It's cheaper to keep her

When your little girl make you mad
And you get an attitude and pack your bags
Five little children that you're leaving behind
Son, you're gonna pay some alimony or do some time

That's why it's cheaper to keep her
Help me say it, y'all
It's cheaper to keep her (it's cheaper to keep her)
See, when you get through staring that judge in the face
You're gonna wanna cuss the whole human race
That's why it's cheaper to keep her (it's cheaper to keep her)
(It's cheaper to keep her)
(It's cheaper, it's cheaper, it's cheaper, it's cheaper)
(It's cheaper to keep her)

You didn't pay but two dollars to bring the little girl home
Now you're about to pay two thousand to leave her alone
You see another woman out there and you wanna make a change
She ain't gonna want you 'cause you won't have a damn thing

That's why it's cheaper to keep her
Everybody sing along with me
It's cheaper to keep her (It's cheaper to keep her)
By the time you get through looking that judge in the face
You're gonna wanna cuss the whole human race
That's why it's cheaper to keep her (It's cheaper to keep her)
Its cheaper to keep her (It's cheaper to keep her)
(It's cheaper, it's cheaper, it's cheaper, it's cheaper)
(It's cheaper to keep her)

I know you think the grass is greener
Way over on the other side
When that judge give you that dirty look
You may as well put your money in mama's pocketbook

That's why it's cheaper to keep her (It's cheaper to keep her)
Cost too much to leave her alone, ha, yeah (It's cheaper to keep her)
I know it's cheaper to keep her, yeah (It's cheaper to keep her)
'Cause you gonna pay some alimony if you leave home (It's cheaper to keep her)

I tell y'all, it's cheaper to keep her
All the fellas out there know what I'm talking bout

Don't you know it's cheaper to stay at home
I gotta tell you
I'll bring you the message tonight
It's cheaper to keep her
Cheaper to keep her
Cheaper to keep her
Cheaper to keep her

She's gonna cause you too much if you let her go, man
It's cheaper to keep her

You might as well put up with your little arguments and fussing and fighting
I am gonna tell you something tonight
I'll tell you, cheaper to keep her

Ain't it, man
Ain't it cheaper to keep her, ha, yeah

By time you get through looking that judge in the face
You'll be lucky if you even have a place
