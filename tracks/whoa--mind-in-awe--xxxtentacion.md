I was like oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh
Oh-oh-oh

Won't look back on my mind
Won't let bad out my shine
Won't let you cloud my mind
Won't let you cloud my mind
All my days, I was crying
All my lows, all my highs
Told my Mom, "I'm gon' shine"
Told my love, "I'm gon'-"

And I was like
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh
Oh-oh-oh

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

And I was like
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh
Oh-oh-oh
