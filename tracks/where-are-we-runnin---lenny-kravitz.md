Fast lane
High speed
On the grind
24/7

No time
Always runnin' here and there
Chasin' the money

So much jibber jabber's
Cloggin' up our soul

Where are we runnin'
We need some time to clear our heads
Where are we runnin'
Keep on working 'til we're dead
Where are we runnin'
Oo wee oo wee oo
Where are we runnin' now

In style
Profile
Got to buy
The new Cavalli

Keep the skin tight
And the booty in the air
Don't stop the party

The road is paved but narrow
I hope we all get home

Where are we runnin'?
We need some time to clear our heads
Where are we runnin'?
Keep on working 'til we're dead
Where are we runnin'?
Oo wee oo wee oo
Where are we runnin' now

Where you runnin' girl
I see you up there
Oh you up on that stage
You up there
I saw you

Where are we running
We need some time to clear our heads
Where are we runnin'
Keep on working 'til we're dead
Where are we runnin'
Oo wee oo wee oo
Where are we runnin' now
Yeah yeah

Where are we running
We need some time to clear our heads
Where are we runnin'
Keep on working 'til we're dead
Where are we runnin'
Oo wee oo wee oo
Where are we runnin' now
Yeah yeah, waouh!
Where are we runnin'...
