Is your love
How deep is your love
Is your love
How deep is your love
How, oh, how
How deep is your love
Oh, how’s your love


Been all day thinkin’, all night wonderin’
Why love has to change
You kiss me, but it’s not real
Tell me what happened
Are we living a lie, baby
Is that magic gone
Oh, do you feel the same way you used to, girl
Oh, tell me is it wrong for us to love like this


How deep is your love
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
Oh…ho…oh…oh…


You run your fingers through my hair
You tell me you love me
You act like everything between us is alright, girl
But you know, you know that it’s not true
You love me or do you wanna leave me, baby
Tell me, girl, I can take it
Something’s just not right, I don’t know, no
Tell me how deep is your love


 I love you
 I love you
Whoa…whoa…oh…oh…
 I love you, love you, love you
Oh, yes, I do, my baby

Do it up, do it up, do it on up, babe
 Mmm, mmm
Shooby dooby dooby doo wop, baby
That means I love you, darlin’
I just can’t figure you out, baby
One minute I think you love me, and then next one I think you don’t
I don’t understand it
Woo…hoo…oh… hoo…oh…oh…hoo…oh…oh…
I’m just goin’ insane tryin’ to figure you out, baby
How deep is your love
I wanna know, you got to tell me, baby
Hoo…hoo…oh…oh…oh…oh…oh…oh…oh…oh…
