Living on free food tickets
Water in the milk
From a hole in the roof
Where the rain came through
What can you do?
Mmm

Tears from your little sister
Crying because
She doesn't have a dress
Without a patch for the party to go
But you know she'll get by


Cause she's living
In the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
(Ah, ah, yeah)

Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
(So cold)
And she can


It's a good thing you don't have bus fare
(It's a good thing, ouch)
It would fall through the hole in your pocket
And you'd lose it

In the snow on the ground
(Ow, ah, ah, yeah)
You gotta walk into town to find a job
(What's it now?)
Trying to keep your hands warm
(It's so cold)

When the hole in your shoe
Let the snow come through
And chill you to the bone
(Brrr, cha)
Somehow you'd better go home where it's warm


Where you can
Live in a love of the common people
Smile from the heart of a family man
(Ah, ah, yeah)

Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
(So cold)
And she can


Living on a dream ain't easy
But the closer the knit
The tighter the fit
(The closer the knit)

And the chills stay away
(Ow, ah, ah, yeah)
Just to take 'em in stride for family pride

You know that faith is your foundation
(Oh, now, oh, now, oh, now)
With a whole lotta love
And a warm conversation

But don't forget to pray
(Forget to pray)
Just making it strong where you belong


And we're living
In the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
(What's it now?)

Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you just
As much as she can
(You're so cold)
And she can

Yes, we're living
In the love of the common people
Smile's from the heart of a family man
(Ah, ah, yeah)

Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
(You're so cold)

Living in the love of the common people
Smile's from the heart of a family man
(What's it now?)

Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
(You're so cold)

Living in the love of the common people
Smile's really hard on a family man
(Ah, ah, yeah)

Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
And she can
