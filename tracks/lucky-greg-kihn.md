Aw, aw, aw

Games, I never used to play
Cause everytime I'd lose
It just turns out that way
I almost lost it all

And then I, I got lucky
Oh I got lucky
I got lucky
Oh I got lucky

In love
My fortunes never changed
And I always took the blame
And I had nothing left to gain
I was just about to quit
And then I, I got lucky
Oh I got lucky
I got lucky
Oh I got lucky
I got lucky
Oh I got lucky
I got lucky

Aw, aw, aw
Aw, aw, aw

Lucky, lucky
Lucky, lucky
Lucky, lucky
Lucky, lucky

Time was always running out
And it took me by surprise
And it filled my life with doubt
I almost lost it all

And then I, I got lucky
Oh I got lucky
I got lucky
Oh I got lucky
I got lucky
Oh I got lucky
I got lucky
Oh I got lucky

Yeah, yeah, oh, oh
