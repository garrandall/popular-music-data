If I were you, I'd the situation over
It wasn't just by accident, our paths were meant to cross eventually
You say you'd lost each time you try to give
Well, I don't mean to tell you how to live
But if I were you, I'd fall in love with me
Don't get me wrong, I don't pretend to know the future
But if you feel it half as much
'Cause I do when your body touches me
Then you must know it's worth at least to try
So please don't let the good life pass you by
Girl, if I were you
I'd fall in love with me
And if you were me, you'd feel a pounding deep inside going stronger
And through these eyes, you'd see there isn't any reason to wait
Any longer
Take my advice and all the love I had to give you
Odds are this time you just can't miss
What happened in the past is history
But what's going on right now can't be denied
I only want to help you to decide
So, if I were you, I'd fall in love with me
