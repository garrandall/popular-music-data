Usher, baby I just wanna get your attention
I really wanna be all up in your head
Yeah, cause what I got, you goin' to get some
Yeah, but girl that's only if you ain't scared

And I won't knock or ring no bells
You just float that bottom up in the air
I'll get you hot, I know you, oh, so well
And when I walk in all that I wanna hear

Is you say daddy's home, home for me
And I know you've been waiting for this love in your day
You know your daddy's home and it's time to play
So you ain't got to give my loving away

So all my ladies say hey, hey, hey, daddy
Hey, hey, hey, daddy
So all my ladies say hey, hey, hey, daddy
Hey, hey, hey, daddy

I ain't gotta do a lot of flexin'
Shorty, you already know what it is
And girl, tonight we gonna do a lot of sexin'
Can't nobody do your body like this

Knock, knock, guess what the goons home
Goin' three days, bought a quarter mil home
Miss me to death, guess what she wrote
I miss you too, put that on your ringtone
Told her when I get back, she can have the Range Rov'
But I'mma take it back, if she ride lame ho
Isn't that the house you wanted? I'll buy you two of those
A hundred thou, baby? That just two shows
Have you ever made love with your neck froze?
With all VVS diamonds in your ear lobes?
Stay out the Maybach, baby, cause it ain't yours
I woulda bought you one, but you wanted the Benzo
Take your shoes off and I'll rub your fat toes
Let me pour Kool Aid on you real slow
And I'll kiss it all off before it hits the floor
Daddy's home, you know how that goes

Is you say, "Daddy's home, home for me"
And I know you've been waiting for this lovin' all day
Your daddy's home, it's time to play
Now, baby, you ain't got to give my loving away

Poke it on out, poke it out right there
I'mma fall back, while you work that chair
Do the damn thing, let the neighbors hear

Poke it on out, poke it out right there
I'mma fall back, while you work that chair
Do the damn thing, all I want to hear
