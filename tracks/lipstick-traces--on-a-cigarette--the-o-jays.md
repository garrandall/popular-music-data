Don't ever leave me
Don't ever leave me

Your pretty brown eyes
Your wavy hair
I won't go home no more
'Cause you're not there

I'm telling you now
Like I told you before
I'm so in love with you
Don't leave me no more
Don't ever leave me

Lipstick traces on a cigarette
Every memory lingers with me yet
I've got it bad like I told you before
I'm so in love with you
Don't leave me no more
(Leave me no more)

(Won't you come on home?)
Won't you come on home?
(Won't you come back home?)
Won't you come back home?

I'm crazy about you
Can't do without you
Won't you come back home?

Lipstick traces on a cigarette
Every memory lingers with me yet
I've got it bad like I told you before
I'm so in love with you
Don't leave me no more
(Don't ever leave me)

Oh, yeah
I've got it bad like I told you before
I'm so in love with you

Don't leave me no more
(Don't ever leave me)
Don't leave me no more
(Don't ever leave me)

Don't leave me no more, baby
(Don't ever leave me)
Don't leave me no more, baby
(Don't ever leave me)
