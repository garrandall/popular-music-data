Heyyyyyyyyy
Woahhhhhhhh
Heyyyyyyyyy
Woahhhhhhhh


Can't even hide it, it's writen on my face
And I don't have any more time or energy to waste
So I'm waving my white flag
Sad it has to be like that
It ain't working out baby in another life or space


Oh I
Baby, I gave you
Ohhhhhh
Everything that I could give you
Sooo I made my decision
Loving you's been a mission


Nowwww I'm in no condition
To love you (No more)
Nowwww I'm in no condition (ummm)
Heyyyyyyyyy
Woahhhhhhhh
Heyyyyyyyyy (Said I'm waving my white flag)
Woahhhhhhhh (Sad it has to be like that)


Barely any happy days, we always seem to have drama (Too much Drama)
And it's really weighing heavy on me baby
Both of us acting crazy
I hate it when we fight 
Middle of the night
Always seems to remind me 
Love, how much it hurts
To know it's getting worse
My faith in us is slowly dying




Nowwww I'm in no condition
To love you (No more)
I'm in no condition
Heyyyyyyyyy (Hey)
Woahhhhhhhh
Heyyyyyyyyy
Woahhhhhhhh

Heyyyyyyyyy (I'm in no condition to love)
Woahhhhhhhh (I'm in no condition to love)
Heyyyyyyyyy (I'm in no condition to love)
Woahhhhhhhh (No Condition!)
Damn
How did you go from being my best friend to me barely even wanting your affection?
I never would've thought (Hey)
That I would be so unhappy
Ohhhhhh oh 
Hold me down (Hey)
Hold me Down (Oh)
Yeah you Hold me Down 
Even though it's sad to say it's over now
I can't love you under these conditions!



So I made my decision
Loving you's been a mission


Nowwwwwwww I'm in no condition
To love you (No More)
I'm in no condition 
Heyyyyyyyyy (I'm in no condition to love, no)
Woahhhhhhhh (I'm in no condition to love, no)
Heyyyyyyyyy (I'm in no condition to love you)
Woahhhhhhhh (I'm in no condition to love, no)
Heyyyyyyyyy (I'm in no condition to love, no)
Woahhhhhhhh (I'm in no condition to love, no)
Heyyyyyyyyy ('m in no condition to love, you)
Woahhhhhhhh (I'm in no condition to love, no)
I'm in no condition to love (No Condition baby!)
I'm in no condition to love, no
I'm in no condition to love you (Heyyyyyyyyy)
Nooooooo
