It's all because of you, I'm feeling sad and blue
You went away, now my life is just a rainy day

And I love you so, how much you'll never know
You've gone away and left me lonely

Untouchable memories, seem to keep haunting me
Of a love so true
That it once turned all my gray skies blue

But you disappeared
Now my eyes are filled with tears
And I'm wishing you were here with me

Soaked with love are my thoughts of you
Now that you're gone, I just don't know what to do

If only you were here
You'd wash away my tears
The sun would shine and once again
You'd be mine all mine

But in reality, you and I will never be
'Cause you took your love away from me

Girl, I don't know what I did
To make you leave me but what I do know
Is that since you've been gone
There's such an emptiness inside
I'm wishing you'd come back to me

If only you were here
You'd wash away my tears
The sun would shine and once again
You'd be mine all mine

But in reality, you and I will never be
'Cause you took your love away from me

Oh, baby, you took your love away from me
