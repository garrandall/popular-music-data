Ive been holding back words
And waiting for time
Theres a lesson here somewhere
I know its mine
And though ill remember the promise we made
Promises don't justify feeling this way, any more

Its time for letting go
We can't hide what we both know
But ohoh ohurt grows
Everytime I think its over

Youve been keepin all your secrets inside
I know the truth now baby, you don't have to hide
But my mind wanders , to the very first day
What a shame things had to turn out this way

Its time for letting go
We can't hide what we both know
But ohohoh
The hurt grows , everytime I think its over

No words, could bring back your affection
And no lies, could keep me holdin on
Holdin on and holdin on

Now I know that its
Time for letting go
We can't hide what we both know
But oh ohoh hurt grows
Everytime I think its over
Its time to realize
That were both just living lies
And way down deep inside
The time is telling me its time for letting go

Let it go
I keep tellin myself over and over
Let it go ...
But my loves still strong
But I just can't keep holding on
And holdin on and holdin on
