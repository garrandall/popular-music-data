Ain't gotta have everything in your life
Going exactly right to party
Maybe the opposite, things are a mess
And that's the best time to burn it down
You look around here and you see all these people
You think their lives are perfect, huh, hardly
Now I don't have all the answers but I'll tell you
The one thing I've found


You take it all with a grain of salt
And realize sometimes it ain't your fault
You got something you don't want to remember
That's when you need to just throw it in a blender
And have a good time
Now add tequila
When life gives you limes
You make margaritas

Now I don't know if you're the type
That sees the glass that's half full or half empty
But I've got an idea how 'bout I never let you get that low
Whatever is done is done, the night is young
Let's have some fun, are you with me
And try to forget the sh*t that hit the fan
The only way that I know

You take it all with a grain of salt
And realize sometimes it ain't your fault
You got something you don't want to remember
That's when you need to just throw it in a blender
And have a good time
Now add tequila
When life gives you limes
You make margaritas

Have a good time
Now add tequila
You're gonna be
You're gonna be just fine
When life gives you limes
You make margaritas
