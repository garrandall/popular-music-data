She's a yellow pair of running shoes
A holey pair of jeans
She looks great in cheap sunglasses
She looks great in anything
She's I want a piece of chocolate
Take me to a movie
She's I can't find a thing to wear
Now and then she's moody


She's a Saturn with a sunroof
With her brown hair a-blowing
She's a soft place to land
And a good feeling knowing
She's a warm conversation
That I wouldn't miss for nothing
She's a fighter when she's mad
And she's a lover when she's loving


And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her, I go on and on and on
Cause she's everything to me


She's a Saturday out on the town
And a church girl on Sunday
She's a cross around her neck
And a cuss word cause it's Monday
She's a bubble bath and candles
Baby come and kiss me
She's a one glass of wine
And she's feeling kinda tipsy


She's the giver I wish I could be
And the stealer of the covers
She's a picture in my wallet
And my unborn children's mother
She's the hand that I'm holding
When I'm on my knees and praying
She's the answer to my prayer
And she's the song that I'm playing


And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her, I go on and on and on
Cause she's everything to me


She's the voice I love to hear
Someday when I'm ninety
She's that wooden rocking chair
I want rocking right beside me
Everyday that passes
I only love her more
Yeah, she's the one
That I'd lay down my own life for


And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
She's everything to me
Yeah she's everything to me


Everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
She's everything to me
