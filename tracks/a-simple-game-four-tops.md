As time goes by
You will see
That we're going to be free
You and me, we'll touch the sky
Can't you see in your mind's eye
That we are one, we're all the same
And life is just a simple game
Oh do do do
(Do do do)
Do do do
(Do do do)
Oh do do do
(Do do do do)

There by your side (oh yeah)
I will be (oh yeah)
When this crazy world is free
Free from doubt
When it finds out
Exactly what we're meant to be
That we are one, we're all the same
And life is just a simple game
Oh do do do
(Do do do)
Oh do do do
(Do do do)
Do do do
(Do do do do)

Thoughts of another day
Flashing through my head
Thinking how life could be
All of the things that I lately have said

Be what you wanna be!
What we deserve to be!
What we are meant to be!
Oh do do do
(Do do do)
Oh do do do
(Do do do)
Oh do do do
(Do do do do)

As time goes by (oh yeah)
You will see
That we're going to be free
You and me, we'll touch the sky
Can't you see in your mind's eye
That we are one, we're all the same
And life is just a simple game
Oh do do do
(Do do do)
Do do do
(Do do do)
Oh do do do
(Do do do do)
You and me
(You and me)
We'll touch the sky
(We'll touch the sky)
Oh, can't you see
(Can't you see)
Oh, do do do
(Do do do do)
Do do do
(Do do do)
Oh do do do
(Do do do do)
Oh do do do
(Do do do do)
Do do do do
(Do do do do)
