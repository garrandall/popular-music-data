We make all of our sons the same
Every one will suffer the fire we've made
They all explode just the same
And there's no going back on the plans we've made

Peacekeeper take your time
Wait for the dark of night
Soon all the suns will rise

Peacekeeper don't tell why
Don't be afraid to fight
Love is the sweet surprise

Oh...oh...

Only creatures who are on their way
Ever poison their own well
But we still have time to hate
And there's still something we can sell

Peacekeeper take your time
Wait for the dark of night
Soon all the suns will rise

Peacekeeper don't tell why (don't tell why)
Don't be afraid to fight
Love is the sweet surprise

When the night is cold and still
When you thought you'd had your fill
Take all the time you will
This is not a test, it's not a drill
Take no prisoners, only kill

Oh...oh...

You know all of our friends are gods
And they all tell us how to paint our face
But there's only one brush we need
It's the one that never leaves a trace (leaves a trace, leaves a trace)

Peacekeeper take your time (peacekeeper take your time)
Wait for the dark of night (wait for the dark of night)
Soon all the suns will rise (soon all the suns will rise)

Peacekeeper don't tell why (peacekeeper don't tell why)
Don't be afraid to fight (don't be afraid to fight)
Love is the sweet surprise (love is the sweet surprise)

Peacekeeper take your time (take your time)
Wait for the dark of night
Soon all the suns will rise (soon all the suns will rise)

Peacekeeper don't tell why (peacekeeper don't tell why)
Don't be afraid to fight (don't be afraid to fight)
Love is the sweet surprise (love is the sweet surprise)

When the night is cold and still
When you thought you'd had your fill
This is not a test, it's not a drill
Take no prisoners, only kill
