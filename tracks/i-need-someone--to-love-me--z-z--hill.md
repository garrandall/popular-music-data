I've done road on my lonelies
If it wasn't for this music, man
I swear they wouldn't phone me
But that's just how it goes, B
I've always been around the wise, so I know who's my co-d
They can't fool me, I swear they can't stall me
Them pussyboys going down south like Morley's
All they ever did was just stall me
It's man crush monday, fell in love when she saw me
Let's take a stroll down ganster hill
Guns and knives is what you see on a ganster's will
I can't wait to the day that I'm soundin' like nine
Sayin', "I got bare jewels like Stamford hill"
My niggas gettin' that money and still bangin'
I hope I be gettin' this money and still rappin'
Open doors don't mean nothin' to me if I'm still trappin'
Do road, do road on my Rambo, there's no lackin'
These niggas sending threats, I don't give a fuck
When my daddy left me he didn't give a fuck
So when I see that certain someone I don't give a fuck
Kidnap a bitch nigga, make him live with us
How we living rough, I swear how we living rough
That's why when my niggas hit the belly all they do is floss
They heard that we be violent, they don't fuck with us
Before my Blackbox came I never heard them sayin'

"You soon blow Abz, you're killing all these shows Abz
You're on my Snapchat and my Twitter, bro, you're known fam"
But my question is, when the buzz decides to leave will they remember me?
"You soon blow Abz, you're killing all these shows Abz
You're on my Snapchat and my Twitter, bro, you're known fam"
But my question is, when the buzz decides to leave will they remember me?

My lifestyle, lately my life's wild
Bitches in my DMs move to me, they want the pipe now
Back then the bitches told man to pipe down
Free YZ, told me, "Abz this is your life now"
Lost Split, lost Y'z, lost Blacks
Lost Daz, man, free my brudda Daz
They got the rest of my bros in the can
It's like they wanna see a crack in the cam
Free Daz, man, they hit my nigga Daz with a 7
That's my sole black star from the 7
Feelin' mad to ride and send a pussy to the heavens
Feelin' mad to ride and teach a pussy boy a lesson
Night in, night out, me and EMIX on the grind out
Pourin' out my heart, I need this right now
It's looking like my niggas gonna die out
I'm tryin'
I wanna see my niggas drivin' fast cars and nice houses
The oldest beef  hurts me
Totty's not number 1 no more, totty's 30
My home's really crumbling in the mix of all this bullshit
Them pussies from the other side stumbled in
I don't even know these pricks, man, I don't even know these hoes
Them dickheads are neeks to the roads
They don't know how it goes
What's the code, bro?
Blast mans face till his bludclart looks like Frodo
I'm on one, it can get sticky in the long run
I hope the love I'm gettin' is for the long run
If not, I'll be posted on the block with my long gun
And trust me, my killers them on what I'm on
Fuck them pussies, they don't feel me
Now the pussy they wan' wan' feel me
I hope the industry really do feel me
Because everyday there's a voice in my head screamin' shit like

"You soon blow Abz, you're killing all these shows Abz
You're on my Snapchat and my Twitter, bro, you're known fam"
But my question is, when the buzz decides to leave will they remember me?
