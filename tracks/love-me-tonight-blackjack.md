I think you know
That it's not my way
And I can't hold back
What I've got to say
Wanna tell you what I'm going through
As I see it in your eyes
You're feeling the same way too

Seems like we've been waiting so long
And lately it's been coming on
Much too strong
The way that I want you
The way that I need you
I'll keep you here just
As long as I can keep you
We can have everything
If you love me tonight
It's gonna be alright tonight
We've gotta break away
We've gotta break away

I can't hide what I
Been feeling all along
'cause deep inside you know

We can't be wrong
I've decided now the rest
Is up to you
Don't keep me waiting
Tell me what to do

Seems like we've been waiting so long
And lately it's been coming on
Much too strong
The way that I want you
The way that I need you
I'll keep you here just
As long as I can keep you
We can have everything
If you love me tonight
It's gonna be alright tonight
We've gotta break away
We've gotta break away

Don't keep me waiting
Knowing you'll say that you want to
Tell me you want me
As much as you know
That I want you
We can have everything

Oh yeah
We can have it all
If you love me tonight
It's gonna be alright tonight
We've gotta break away
We've gotta break away
Tonight, tonight
It's gonna be alright tonight
