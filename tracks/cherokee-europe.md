They lived in peace, not long ago
A mighty Indian tribe
But the winds of change
Had made them realize, that the promises were lies

The white man's greed, in search of gold
Made the nation bleed
They had lost their faith
And now they had to learn
There was no place to return
Nowhere they could turn

Cherokee - marching on the trail of tears
Cherokee - marching on the trail of tears

They were driven hard, across the plains
And walked for many moons
Cause the winds of change
Had made them realize, that the promises were lies

So much to bear, all that pain
Left them in despair
They had lost their faith
And now they had to learn
There was no place to return
Nowhere they could turn

Cherokee - marching on the trail of tears
Cherokee - marching on the trail of tears

Cherokee - marching on the trail of tears
Cherokee - marching on the trail of tears
Cherokee - marching on the trail of tears
Cherokee - marching on the trail of tears
