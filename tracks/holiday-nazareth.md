Drinkin' my wine, makes me feel fine,
Gonna have me a holiday
Poorman's party, rich man's daughter,
Gettin' hotter and hotter.

She's pushin' way too hard
I don't want any part of her way
Drinkin' my wine, makes me feel fine,
Gonna have me a holiday.

It's a holiday, it's a holiday

Mama, mama, please no more jaguars
I don't want to be a pop star
Mama, mama, please no more deckhands
I don't want to be a sailor man
Mama, mama, please no more facelifts
I just don't know which one you is
Mama, mama, please no more husbands

Drinkin' my wine, wastin' my time
Hidin' out in my rented dream
Lookin' for attention
A cover story mention in
Life magazine
Ask the chauffeur who he knows
Numbers he's got, lots of those.

Drinkin' my wine, spendin' my time
Tryin' to run from this halloween.

It's a holiday, it's a holiday

Mama, mama, please no more jaguars
I don't want to be a pop star
Mama, mama, please no more deckhands
I don't wanna be a sailor man
Mama, mama, please no more facelifts
I just don't know which one you is
Mama, mama, please no more husbands
I don't know who my daddy is.

It's a holiday, it's a holiday
