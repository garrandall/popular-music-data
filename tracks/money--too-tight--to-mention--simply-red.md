I've been laid off from work my rent is due
My kids all need brand new shoe
So I went to the bank to see what they could do
They said, "Son look like bad luck got a hold on you"
Money's too tight to mention
I can't get an unemployment extension
Money's too tight to mention
I went to my brother to see what he could do
He said brother I'd like to help but I'm unable to
So I called on my father, oh my father
Almighty Father, He said
"Money's too tight to mention"
Oh money, money, money, money
Money's too tight to mention
I can't even qualify for my pension
We're talking about Reaganomics
Oh Lord down in the Congress
They're passing all kinds of bills
From down on Capitol Hill, we've tried it
Money's too tight to mention cutback
Money's too tight to mention
Oh money, money, money, money
We're talking about money, money
We're talking about money, money
We're talking about money, money
Money, money, money
We're talking about the dollar bill
And that old man that's over the hill
Now what are we all to do
When money's got a hold on you?
Money's too tight to mention
Oh money, money, money, money
Money's too tight to mention
Dinero' money oh
I'm talking about money, money
I'm talking about money, money
Yeah I'm talking about money
I'm talking about money money
Did the earth move for you Nancy?
Did the earth move for you Nancy?
Did the earth move for you Nancy?
Did the earth move for you Nancy?
Yeah I'm talkin' Nancy
Yeah I'm talkin' Nancy
Yeah I'm talkin' Nancy
Yeah I'm talkin' about
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah I want some money, money, money
Read my Heaven, oh man
The sight of all that money
