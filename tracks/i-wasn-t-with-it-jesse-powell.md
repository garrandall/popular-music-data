Uh, uh, uh
What? Check it out
Check it, check it, check it out
Check it out
Check it, check it, check it out
Now tell your girlfriends to mind their business
Yeah, what
Tell your girlfriends to mind their business

I swear I never ever told you no lies
I'm where I wanna be, right by your side
(Come on, what)
I never meant for you to question me why
Cuz you're the only one girl, in my life, yeah

1 - So don't you say it, say it
I didn't hit it, hit it
I wasn't wit it, wit it
I wouldn't cheat on you
So don't you say it, say it
I didn't hit it, hit it
I ain't wit it, wit it
I wouldn't cheat on you

What makes you think I wanna play around, baby
And jeapordize the love we have, no way
And girl I do still love you the same, um hm
So don't you listen to a word your girlfriends say
No, no, no, no

Repeat 1

How can I change your mind
Baby, I never meant to make you cry, no
So tell me what I've done wrong
To ever make you think that I would do you wrong, oh

So don't you say it, say it
You stop listening to your girlfriends
Baby, just leave 'em alone
I didn't hit it, I wasn't wit it
Come on baby, come on baby
Stop shivering, stop listening
Your girlfriends baby, just leave 'em alone
I didn't hit it, hit it
I wasn't wit it, wit it
Come on baby

Repeat 1 until fade
