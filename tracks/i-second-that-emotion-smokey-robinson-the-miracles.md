Maybe you want to give me kisses sweet
But only for one night with no repeat
And maybe you'd go away and never call
And a taste of honey is worse than none at all


Oh, little girl, in that case I don't want no part
That would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like loving me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion
Said, if you feel like giving me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion


Maybe you think that love would tie you down
And you don't have the time to hang around
Maybe you think that love was made for fools
So it makes you wise to break the rules


Oh, little girl, in that case I don't want no part
That would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like loving me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion
Said, if you feel like giving me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion
Oh, little girl, in that case I don't want no part
That would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like loving me
If you got the notion
I second that emotion
Said, if you feel like giving me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion
