Maybe you wanna give me kisses sweet
But for only one night with no repeat
Maybe you'll go away and never call
And a taste of honey is worse than none at all
In that case I don't want no part
That would only break my heart

But if you feel like loving me
If you've got the notion
I second that emotion
Say if you feel like giving me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion

Maybe you think that love will tie you down
And you don't have the time to hang around
Maybe you think that love was made for fools
And so it makes you wise to break the rules
In that case I don't want no part
'Cause that would only break my heart
But if you feel like loving me
If you've got the notion
I second that emotion
Say if you feel like giving me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion

In that case I don't want no part
That would only break my heart

But if you feel like loving me
If you've got the notion
I second that emotion
But if you feel like giving me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion

But if you feel like giving me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion
