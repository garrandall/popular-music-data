Hey, Halright

Sometimes dreamin'
I'm in here schemin' on you

Collectin' headers
With nothin' better to do

Memory is everywhere
Love and you is in my hair
And eyes
Maybe with the time and place
A look will come upon your face
Of surprise

When you see the people in me
Minus you what will you do

When you see the people in me
Minus you it's overdue

While I'm cryin
I'm rectifyin' the cause
Friends are cheerin'
And I'm hearin' applause

The train is here you better run
Don't call me I'll never come
Unto you
They're over now the games you play
Just what you'll do, just what you'll say
Uh oh you

— Middle —

Memory is everywhere
Love and you is in my hair
And eyes
Maybe with the time and place
A look will come upon your face
Of surprise

When you see the people in me
Minus you what will you do

When you see the people in me
Minus you it's overdue

Hut, Halright
