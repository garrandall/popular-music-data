She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
No she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made
No

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
You don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

You don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says "beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything"
"What's a little bit of hunger?"
"I can go a little while longer," she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, whoa oh, whoa oh oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
You don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

You don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

There's a hope that's waiting for us in the dark
We should know we're beautiful just the way we are
And you don't have to change, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
We're beautiful
You don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
