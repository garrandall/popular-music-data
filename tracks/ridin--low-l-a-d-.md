Here we go again
As I proceed to get my cruise on
You and I alone on our own
As we gon' to the top of the mountain by the water fountain gettin' it on
And we ain't leaving till the early break of morn
Because it's all about my baby doll and me
From the bottom of the barrel, to the top and it don't stop
Because a true G never runs outta gas
Cause if he does, gimme two and two and let it pass
She don't get mad if I get down and heat the secret stash
Because a brother like me known to make that secret blast
And I'ma make you right and ready, yo to cruise with me
But save the drama, cause can't nobody feel my lady
She never shady, she's never been that kinda flirt
And as we cruise, kick the flavor, cause this can work
So let me kiss you in the places that no one else can get
As we do it up in Ridin Low

Ridin Low, with my girl
And feeling high
You're so fine, and you're mine
All mine, yeah

Hold me tight, babydoll
Let's take a cruise into the night
Oh yeah
Everything will be alright, woah

She's macadocioius, she takes me to another level, hands-on protection
So don't nobody get in trouble, don't bust my bubble honey
I can't wait to see your face
It's only been a day
But already these empty spaces making me crazy
Baby yo I love you too
I'm calling up your crib
Cause girl I wanna cruise wit you
Keep it on the down low, so don't nobody else know
Honey, then again, it's you the world I wanna show
So just kick back and enjoy the ride
Cause every woman needs a G to be by her side
And if I'm cruisin with you, the feeling's right
From the early break of morning till the break of night
And lady trip, it still ain't over yet, there's still a lot to hit
Relaxin ridin low, low as we can get
Kickin it And it's on, ridin low
Just you and I alone
Me and my girl, and we're ridin' low

Ridin Low, with my girl
And feeling high
You're so fine, and you're mine
All mine, yeah

Hold me tight, babydoll
Let's take a cruise into the night
Oh yeah
Everything will be alright, woah

Cruise into the night honey
I won't bite unless you want me to
Blunts and phillies just to keep the cruisin chilly huh
I'm takin it away straight out just like come Columbo
Cause when I cruise wit you it's the bomb yo
So come wit me and baby we can cruise the night away
A little bit of conversation and alotta play
Let's reminisce, reminisce over all the love we share
Thats how we do, let me take you there
