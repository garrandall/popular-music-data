Here I stand oh baby
All alone and shy
I hear the music play
You know it makes me oh so high
Set my soul on fire
Come take me higher
That is my desire
I want to dance with you
Oh baby. All night through

Let's take the rocket high
The space we'll glide
Nonstop to the moon

Oh baby dance with me
I want to dance with you

Dance with me
Oh baby get down in the groove
Just keep that funky step
You know I like the way you move
We've got it going strong
Now we belong
Together when the music's moving

Dance with me
I want to dance with you
