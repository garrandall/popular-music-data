Dear momma
Love you momma
I ain't goin, momma
That be Maaly Raw

Dear momma
I don't wanna sign off (no way)
Outchea getting commas (commas)
Like my dad, I'm a grinder (oh yeah)
She don't want me locked up
Momma I'm gon' wash up (wash up)
Whip my wrist it lock up (yeah)
All my diamonds rocked up (oh yeah)
I don't wanna sign off (woah)

Momma love me so I can do no wrong (do no wrong)
Momma in the trap so this her favorite song (favorite song)
I'm gon' get them racks lil baby they some more
Said I wasn't nothing but I can destroy
You got the best advice but I won't call (no way)
I know I'm grown so I do not need ya'll (I got it)
And if I get locked up, momma change the law (oh yeah)
You fix everything so that's what I thought
When I was small momma made me tall (made me tall)
Even though I'm daddy pup she still gon' wipe my paws
Don't care about this money, don't care about them cars (she drivin')
Lose my momma that's a problem you can't solve

Dear momma
I don't wanna sign off (no way)
Out here getting commas (commas)
Like my dad, I'm a grinder (oh yeah)
She don't want me locked up (I do)
Momma I'm gon' wash up (wash up)
Whip my wrist it lock up (yeah)
All my diamonds rocked up (oh yeah)
I don't wanna sign off (woah)

Now I got the game in a headlock (headlock)
Never catch me lackin' run a red light (no lackin' shorty, skrrt)
Bitch we talkin' codes we the red slugs (on folk n'em)
They tried to break my safe I had a deadlock (deadlock)
Momma used a bag in the day time (day time)
Momma got the bag by the night time (night time)
Was on thirty second street I was like everything (I ain't crumblin')
Moved to FrancisVille and met my real friends (bah)
Momma said stay down there fore you get hurt
That was way before I was Lil Uzi Vert (1600)
Momma saw me in action it could've got worse (1600)
I know that my momma know I'm shootin' first

Dear momma
I don't wanna sign off (no way)
Outchea getting commas (commas)
Like my dad, I'm a grinder (oh yeah)
She don't want me locked up (I do)
Momma I'm gon' wash up (yeah)
Whip my wrist it lock up (yeah)
All my diamonds rocked up (oh yeah)
I don't wanna sign off (woah)

Dear momma (1600)
Love you momma
That's my momma (1600 block)
