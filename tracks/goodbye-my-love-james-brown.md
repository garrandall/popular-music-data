You know sometimes a man 
Or a woman makes a mistake 
Try to find a reason for making a mistake 
But there is no reason for making a mistake 
The only thing you do is when 
You make a mistake is say I'm sorry 
Take a man or a woman to say I'm sorry 
And it takes a fool to walk away 

So right here I want to say I'm sorry 
I don't know where you are 
But you know I need you 
Now there's one more thing I'd like to say right here 
I could say goodbye, you just don't understand 
I could say baby I believe you got another man 
And that I could say I just can't help myself 
But I wouldn't be a man 

And that I could say maybe we don't have nothing left 
But I want you to know I still love you 
Oh no matter where you go, I still love you 
Oh, oh take it down Jimmy 
Goodbye my love, throwing me away 

Goodbye my love 
There's one more thing you know to have 
Someone to worry when you're wrong 
Feel the need of a real person 
When your friends drop you behind 
To kill your anger just by being nice and kind 
I could say if you leave it wouldn't bother me 
But I know that would be a lie 
Cause baby deep down you bother me 
But I want you to know and I don't care who knows 
I still love you 
Woa, oh, I still love you 
Oh, oh take it down Jimmy 
Oh, oh take it down Jimmy look a here
