What kind of fool am I
Who never fell in love
It seems that I'm thee only one
That I have been thinking of

What kind of man is this
An empty shell
A lonely cell in which
An empty heart must dwell

What kind of lips are these
That lied with every kiss
That whispered empty words of love
That left me alone like this

Why can't I fall in love
Like any other man
And maybe then I'll know
What kind of fool I am

What kind of clown am I
What do I know of life
Why can't I cast away this mask of play and live my life

Why can't I fall in love
Like any other man
And maybe then I'll know
What kind of fool I am
