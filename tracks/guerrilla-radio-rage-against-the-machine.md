Transmission, third world war, third round
A decade of the weapon of sound above ground
No shelter if you're lookin' for shade
I lick shots at the brutal charade

As the polls close like a casket
On truth devoured
A silent play in the shadow of power
A spectacle monopolized
The camera's eyes
On choice disguised

Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
Yes, a spectacle monopolized
They hold the reins and stole your eyes

Or the fist-a-gons
The bullets and bombs
Who stuff the banks
Who staff the party ranks

More for Gore or the son of a drug lord
None of the above. Fuck it! Cut the cord

Lights out
Guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out
Guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out
Guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out
Guerrilla radio

Contact. I hijacked the frequencies
Blockin' the beltway, move on D.C
Way past the days of bombin' MCs
Sound off. Mumia guan be free

Who got 'em? Yo check the federal file
All you pen devils know the trial was vile
An army of pigs try to silence my style
Off 'em all out that box. It's my radio dial

Lights out
Guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out
Guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out
Guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up
Lights out
Guerrilla radio
Turn that shit up

It has to start somewhere
It has to start sometime
What better place than here
What better time than now?

All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
