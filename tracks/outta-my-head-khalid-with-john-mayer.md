I'm here outside when you’re ready (When you're ready for me)
Bring out the shots and confetti (All night long)
I'll take you home if you let me, yeah (Oh yeah)
Just promise you won’t forget me, no


'Cause the days get brighter when you're here
So I gotta keep you near
Goin' crazy and I just can't get you outta my head
Love is in the atmosphere, you can feel it in the air
Gettin' hazy and I just can't get you outta my head


Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah (My)
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah (My head)
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah (My)
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Just can't get you outta my head


You locked the door and it’s raining (Just let it rain down)
But baby, I’m not complaining, no
We hit the road and we're racin’ yeah
You make me super impatient (Oh)
Can you feel the tension? You've got my attention
I know we're just friends, but I'd rather be together instead, yeah


’Cause the days get brighter when you're here
So I gotta keep you near (Oh-ah)
Goin' crazy and I just can't get you outta my head (Yeah)
Love is in the atmosphere, you can feel it in the air (Oh)
Gettin' hazy and I just can't get you outta my head


Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah (My)
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah (My head)
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah (My)
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Just can't get you outta my head


Can't get you outta my head
My head, my head
My head, my head
My head, my head
My head, my head
Can't get you outta my head
My head, my head
My head, my head
Can't get you outta my


Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah (My)
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah (My head)
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah (My)
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Just can't get you outta my head
