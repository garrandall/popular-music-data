Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, Montana!
Work-work-work-work-work-work
What you twerkin' with?
Throw it, bust it open
Show me what you twerkin' with
Ass so fat need a lap dance
I'm in that white ghost chasin' Pac-Man
Hundred out the lot, I be leanin', that CÎROC
Hundred large, bring a mop
Car's tinted like Barack
Got a Brinks truck in my pocket (Pocket)
30 chains on my collar (Collar)
Two drops, no mileage (Mileage)
Top off like Wallace
And I'm inhalin' smoke, bitch know that (Know that)
Filthy rich before rap ('Fore rap)
Your new deal, I throw that (Throw that)
Three beans I'm on that (Haaan)
We pop a molly (Haaan), she bust it open (Haaan)
She seen the 'gatti (Haaan), that pussy soakin' (Woo!)

Strawberries, Luke what it do?
Don't stop, pop that, don't stop
Let's go
Pop that, pussy, pussy
What you twerkin' with?


I love my big booty bitches, my life a Godfather picture
Local club in my city, I fell in love with a stripper
Bitches know I'm that nigga, talkin' four-door Bugatti
I'm the life of the party, let's get these hoes on the Molly
You know I came to stunt, so drop that pussy, bitch
I got what you want, drop that pussy, bitch (Woo)
Film it, film it, this bitch want me to film it
Ballin', ballin' like I play for New England
Spend it, spend it, spend a stack every minute
That's 50... one hundred, I see no fuckin' limits
Shout out to Uncle Luke (Huh)
Shout out my bitches too (Huh)
We the 2 Live Crew
Two for me, two for you (Woo)
Feed them bitches carrots (Huh)
Fuck em like a rabbit
Sorry that's a habit, smoke a spliff and then I vanish


Don't stop, pop that, don't stop
Pop that, pop that, pop that (Bounce)
Don't stop, pop that, don't stop
Pop that, pussy, pussy
What you twerkin' with? (Yeah)
Don't stop, pop that, don't stop
Pop that, pop that, pop that (Bounce, don't stop)
Don't stop, pop that, don't stop
Let's go
Pop that, pussy, pussy
What you twerkin' with?


I'm about bein' single, seein' double, makin' triple (Right)
I hope you pussy niggas hatin' never make a nickel (Right)
It's good to make it better when your people make it with you
Money comin', money goin', ain't like you could take it with you (Alright)
It's about to be a hit right now, fuck back then we the shit right now
Dropped Take Care, bought a mothafuckin' crib
And I'm pickin' up the keys to the bitch right now
OVO that's major shit, Toronto with me that's mayor shit
Gettin cheddar packs like K.D., OKC that's player shit
We don't dress alike, we don't rap alike
I shine different, I rhyme different
Only thing you got is some years on me
Man fuck you and your time difference
I'm Young Papi, Champagne
They know the face and they know the name
Got one watch that could prolly pay for like all your chains
And you'd owe me change, ah!
Greystone, 20 bottles that's all me
On the couch, wildin' out yelling free my niggas 'til they all free
One of my closest dawgs got three kids and they all three
But we always been that type of crew that been good without a plan B, so


Don't stop, pop that, don't stop
Pop that, pop that, pop that (Bounce)
Don't stop, pop that, don't stop
Pop that, pussy, pussy
What you twerkin' with?
Don't stop, pop that, don't stop
Pop that, pop that, pop that (Bounce)
Don't stop, pop that, don't stop
Pop that, pussy, pussy
What you twerkin' with?


Bitch! Stop talkin' that shit
And suck a nigga dick for some Trukfit
Okay I fuck a bitch and I'm gone
That’s gangsta: Al Capone
I make that pussy spit like Bone
I'm talkin' 'bout bone, bone, bone bone
I'm fuckin' with French, excuse my French
I lose my mind before I lose my bitch
Money ain't a thing but a chicken wing
Bitch I ball like two eyelids
YMCM beat that pussy up, stop playin'
I make her ass scream and holla like rock bands
I'm a beast, I'm off the leash
I am rich like a bitch
On my Proactiv shit, pop that pussy like a zit
I go by the name Lil Tunechi
Your girl is a groupie
And nigga, you's a square
And I will twist you like in a Rubik's
Motherfucker I'm on my skateboard
Watch me do a trick, ho
I’m 5'5" but I could 6-9
Then beat that pussy like Klitschko
It's French Montana, fuck Joe
It's Weezy F, fuck hoes
It's Truk the world
It's Truk yo girl
It's Trukfit by the truck load, biatch!


Don't stop, pop that, don't stop
Pop that, pop that, pop that (Bounce)
Don't stop, pop that, don't stop
Pop that, pussy, pussy (Oh yeah)
What you twerkin' with?
Don't stop, pop that, don't stop (I forgot)
Pop that, pop that, pop that (Bounce)
Don't stop, pop that, don't stop
What you twerkin' with?
Young Moolah, baby!
