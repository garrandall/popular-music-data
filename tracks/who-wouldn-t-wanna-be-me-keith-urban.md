I got no money in my pockets
I got a hole in my jeans
I had a job and I lost it
But it won't get to me

Because I'm riding with my baby
And it's a brand new day
We're on the wheels of an angel
Flying away


And the sun is shining
This road keeps winding
Through the prettiest country
From Georgia to Tennessee
And I got the one I love beside me
My troubles behind me
I'm alive and I'm free
Who wouldn't wanna be me


Now she's strumming on my six-string
Across her pretty knees
She's stomping out a rhythm
And singing to me the sweetest song


And the sun is shining
This road keeps winding
Through the prettiest country
From Georgia to Tennessee
And I got the one I love beside me
My troubles behind me
I'm alive and I'm free
Who wouldn't wanna be me
And the sun is shining
This road keeps winding
Through the prettiest country
From Georgia to Tennessee
And I got the one I love beside me
My troubles behind me
I'm alive and I'm free
Who wouldn't wanna be me


I got no money in my pockets
I got a hole in my jeans
We're on the wheels of an angel
And I'm free
She's strumming on my six-string
It's across her pretty knees
She's stomping out a rhythm
And she's singin' to me
