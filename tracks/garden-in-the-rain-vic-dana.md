Twas just a garden in the rain
Close to a little leafy lane
A touch of Heaven
Neath skies of gray

The raindrops
Kissed the flowerbeds
The blossoms raised
Their thirsty heads

A perfumed thank you
They seemed to say

Surely, here was charm
Beyond compare to view
Maybe it was just that
I was there with you

Twas just a garden in the rain
But then the sun came out again
And sent us happily on our way
And sent us happily on our way
