Hey babe won't you tell me what you've got going on
Just a little later on tonight
How about you and me get together have a couple drinks
Well don't you think that sounds like, a good time

You start striding over
We can't get no closer
Ain't no room in the middle
Girl watcha doing a little later

Let's go start a fire
How about you and i get this thing moving shaking grooving
Baby tell me what your doing
Later on later on later on later on later on later on

Girl your shining like a movie star
And y'know you look so good
I can't stop staring
And I can tell that your feelin' it too
What you wanna do with that smile your wearing
Oh yeah

What you say we got lost lets go
Spend a couple hours just getting to know each other
Out there in the moonlight glow
And when we get alone

You start striding over
We can't get no closer
Ain't no room in the middle
Girl watcha doing a little later

Let's go start a fire
How about you and i get this thing moving shaking grooving
Baby tell me what your doing
Later on later on later on later on later on later on

You start striding over
We can't get no closer
Ain't no room in the middle
Girl watcha doing a little later

Let's go start a fire
How about you and I get this thing moving shaking grooving
Baby tell me what your doing
Later on later on later on later on later on later on
