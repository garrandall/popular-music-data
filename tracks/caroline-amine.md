Listen, man
What's up?
I heard you done got you a dime piece, man
Hell naw, man
One of them BeyoncÃ©, Meagan Good types
Nah, nah, nah
Is that true, man?
I just wanna know
Probably not
I mean, shit to be honest with you, man, she's a

Bad thang, fine as hell, thick as fuck
Oh my god, that's my baby
Caroline, you divine
Mighty fine
Shawty really blow the pipe (that's true)
Like a pro
"Fuck," you thought
Holy shit, I'm really lit
It's looking like it's 'bout time to fuck it up
Caroline, listen up, don't wanna hear
About ya horoscope or what the future holds
Shut up and shut up and
Let's get gory, like a Tarantino movie
Don't wanna talk it out, can we fuck it out?
'Cause we gon' be up all night, fuck a decaf
You say I'm a tall thug, guess I'm a G-raffe
If ya want safe-sex, baby use the knee pads
Freaky with the sticky icky
Baby give me kitty kitty
Killa, westside nigga
Boy you like 98 degrees
And I'm 300, nigga keep ya feet runnin'
I chief keef keef when I eat these beats
Better boy get scurred
Don't run up in my lane, I don't want you in my lane
You a lame, get swerved

'Cause great scenes might be great
But I love your bloopers
And perfect's for the urgent
Baby, I want forever
Caroline, don't you see that
I want you to be my

Bad thang, fine as hell, thick as fuck
Oh my god, that's my baby
Caroline, you divine
Mighty fine
Shawty really blow the pipe (that's true)
Like a pro
Holy shit, I'm really lit
