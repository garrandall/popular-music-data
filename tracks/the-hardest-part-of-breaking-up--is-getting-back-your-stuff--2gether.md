C'mon
Yeaaa

Yea 2gether's in the house!
Put your hands in the air
'cause we'll make ya bounce. c'mon

oh yea

It's been so long since I've seen your face
So long since I've been to first base.
*strike 3 your out*
I really miss the feel of your kiss.
But can I have back my things before
I get really pissed?

You had my heart, my soul, my attention
But you walked out my life with my CD collection.

We're Breaking Up!

Breaking up is hard enough (oh oh oh oh)
Say you had nothing but I called your bluff.
You got my sweaters, my hat...
I can't find my cat! *meow*
The Hardest Part Of Breaking Up
is getting Back Your Stuff.

Yea 2gether's in the house
Put your hands in the air
'cause we'll make ya bounce c'mon yea.

So tell me girl, do I have to say please
or do I have to involve the police.
*We have you surrounded*
There was a time when I'd trust you alone.
I'd call you up girl, but you took my phone.

You borrow stuff every time I turn my back.
*hey that's mine!*
I can't believe I went out with a KLEPTOMANIAC!

We're breaking up!

Breaking up is hard enough (oh oh oh oh)
Say you had nothing but I called your bluff.
You got my sweaters, my hat...
I can't find my cat! *meow*
The Hardest Part Of Breaking Up
is getting Back Your Stuff.


Man you ever break up with a girl
And she keeps your stuff?
Man, What's up with dat?!
I dunno man, something wrong!
Ya know what I'm say?
Something wrong with dat...

Yea, Uh Mickey Parke up in this mug
Here we go one, two
Yea, Yea, Yea
U plus ME, it doesn't equal us.
You took my car now I gotta take the bus.
I thought I had a girl that I could trust.
I guess I never knew my calculus!

Breaking up is hard enough (oh oh oh oh)
Say you had nothing but I called your bluff.
You got my sweaters, my hat...
I can't find my cat! *meow*
The Hardest Part Of Breaking Up
is getting Back Your Stuff.
