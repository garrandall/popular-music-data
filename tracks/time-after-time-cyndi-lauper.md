Lying in my bed, I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights almost left behind
Suitcase of memories, time after—
Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, "Go slow."
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds


If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting (I will be waiting)
Time after time


After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time


If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time




You said, "Go slow." I fall behind
The second hand unwinds


If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting (I will be waiting)
Time after time


Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after… time…
