How come you're always such a fussy young man
Don't want no Cap'n Crunch, don't want no Raisin Bran
Well don't you know that other kids are starvin' in Japan
So eat it, just eat it

Don't want to argue, I don't want to debate
Don't want to hear about what kinds of foods you hate
You won't get no dessert 'till you clean off your plate


So eat it
Don't you tell me you're full
Just eat it, eat it
Get yourself an egg and beat it
Have some more chicken
Have some more pie
It doesn't matter
If it's boiled or fried
Just eat it, just eat it
Just eat it, just eat it, Woo!


Your table manners are a crying shame
You're playing with your food, this ain't some kind of game
Now, if you starve to death
You'll just have yourself to blame
So eat it. Just eat it

You better listen, better do as you're told
You haven't even touched your tuna casserole
You better chow down, or it's gonna get cold


So eat it
I don't care if you're full
Just eat it, eat it
Open up your mouth and feed it
Have some more yogurt
Have some more Spam
It doesn't matter if it's fresh or canned
Just eat it! Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!
Don't you make me repeat it!
Have a banana, have a whole bunch
It doesn't matter what you had for lunch
Just eat it! Eat it!
Eat it! Eat it!


Eat it! Eat it!
If it's getting cold, reheat it
Have a big dinner
Have a light snack
If you don't like it, you can't send it back
Just eat it! Eat it!
Get yourself an egg and beat it!
Have some more chicken. Have some more pie
It doesn't matter if it's boiled or fried
Just eat it! Eat it!
Don't you make me repeat it!
