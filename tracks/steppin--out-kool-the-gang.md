Steppin' out, with my baby
Steppin' out

You work hard the way I do
Comfort me when I am blue
All these things you do for me
That's why we're steppin' out tonight

Steppin' out
Just you and me baby
Steppin' out
We're Steppin' out

Steppin' out, with my baby
Steppin' out

I adore the things you do
You make me feel special
Tonight there's just me and you
And we're steppin' out tonight

Steppin' out
Just you and me baby
Steppin' out, with my baby
Steppin' out
We will paint the town tonight
Steppin' out, with my baby
Steppin' out
Love will make us feel alright

Everyday you find a way
To bring a smile to my face
All these things you do for me
That's why we're moving on

Steppin' out
Just you and me baby
Steppin' out
Steppin' out
Just you and me baby
Steppin' out
We're Steppin' out
Steppin' out
Come on, baby
Steppin' out

I like the way you move
You dance so smooth
Tonight there's just me and you
That's why we're steppin' out tonight

Steppin' out, with my baby
Steppin' out

This is the least I can do
Anything just to please you
And we're gonna move on

Steppin' out
Just you and me baby
Steppin' out
We're Steppin' out
Steppin' out, with my baby
Come on, baby
Steppin' out

We're gonna paint the town
Love will make us feel alright
Steppin' out
This is your night
Steppin' out, with my baby
Come on, baby
Steppin' out
Steppin' out
