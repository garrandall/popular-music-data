Tonight, tonight, tonight

What a lovely feeling, music so appealing
Steppin' into love, my baby and I
When we start the dancin', we begin romancin'
Steppin' into love, my baby and I

Steppin' into love tonight
Steppin' to the love

Music is so thrilling and she is so willing
Steppin' into love, my baby and I
Every beat's a love song, nothing here can go wrong
Steppin' into love, my baby and I

Steppin' into love tonight
Steppin' to the love

Every night we go out and dance
There's a chance to increase romance
And we know every beat is love
Steppin' into love
Steppin' into love

Every night we go out and dance
There's a chance to increase romance
And we know every beat is love
Steppin' into love
Tonight, tonight, tonight

The beat is gettin' stronger, we dance a little longer
Steppin' into love, my baby and I
Steppin' in a small way, says I love her always
Steppin' into love, my baby and I

Steppin' into love tonight
Steppin' into the love, whoa, tonight

Every night we go out and dance
There's a chance to increase romance

And we know every beat is love
Steppin' to love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, all night
