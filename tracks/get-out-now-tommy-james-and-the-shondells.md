Heartbreak, baby. Heartbreak, baby

I can see the heartbreak that he puts you through
And I've seen enough to know he's not in love with you
And I understand your feelings, girl, I really do
Baby, I've been through it, go ahead and do it, baby

Get out, get out, get out now. Get out, he doesn't love you baby
Get out, get out, get out now. Get out, my love is more than maybe

Can't you see your future, girl, is lookin' dim
'Cause he don't need the love that you're givin' him
And I'm only cryin' tears, the deeper you get in?
Girl, you never tell him. Tell him that you're through and baby

Get out, get out, get out now. Get out, he doesn't love you baby
Get out, get out, get out now. Get out, my love is more than maybe

Girl, it's gettin' late, you go no time to wait
And if you hesitate, I know that you'll be sorry

It's time to
Get out, get out, get out now. Get out, he doesn't love you baby
Get out, get out, get out now. Get out, my love is more than maybe
