Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

First you say you love me
Then you say you're going to leave me
Better get yourself together
Cause I'm telling you you'll never
No, you'll never gonna change me
So don't try to rearrange me
Best be leaving, I'll be leaving
Girl, you better watch out
Hey!

You better watch out
Hey!

You better watch out
Hey!

To what I'm saying
What's on my mind, yeah
It's time for laying things on the line now
I can make you happy
You know I can
But you gotta take me the way I am
Hey!

You better watch out
Hey!

You better watch out
Hey!

You say I'm wasting time
Chasing after dreams, yeah
You say I bring you down
Yet it seems
No matter what I do
Works out the same
You're always in the right
And I'm the one to blame
Ah!
Yeah!

You better watch out
Hey!

You better watch out
Hey!

First you say you love me
Then you say you're going to leave me
Better get yourself together
Cause I'm telling you you'll never
No, you'll never gonna change me
So don't try to rearrange me
Best be leaving, I'll be leaving
Girl, you better watch out
Hey!

You better watch out
Hey!

You better watch out
Hey!

You better watch out
Hey!

You better watch out
Hey!

You better watch out
Hey!
