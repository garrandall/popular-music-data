Look up here, Iâm in heaven
Iâve got scars that canât be seen
Iâve got drama, canât be stolen
Everybody knows me now

Look up here, man, Iâm in danger
Iâve got nothing left to lose
Iâm so high it makes my brain whirl
Dropped my cell phone down below

Ainât that just like me

By the time I got to New York
I was living like a king
Then I used up all my money
I was looking for your ass

This way or no way
You know, Iâll be free
Just like that bluebird
Now ainât that just like me

Oh Iâll be free
Just like that bluebird
Oh Iâll be free
Ainât that just like me
