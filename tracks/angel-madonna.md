Why am I standing on a cloud
Every time you're around?
And my sadness disappears
Every time you are near


You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now, I realize


Oh you're an angel
Oh you're an angel
Oh you're an angel in disguise
I can see it in your eyes


Walking down a crowded avenue
Other faces seem like nothing next to you
And I can't hear the traffic rushing by
Just the pounding of my heart and that's why


You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now, I realize


Oh you're an angel
Oh you're an angel
Oh you're an angel in disguise
I can see it in your eyes
Oh you're an angel
Oh you're an angel
Oh you're an angel in disguise
I can see it in your eyes


You're an angel
You're an angel, baby
You're an angel
You must be an angel


Now I believe that dreams come true
Cause you came when I wished for you
This just can't be coincidence
The only way that this makes sense is that


Oh you're an angel
Oh you're an angel
Oh you're an angel in disguise
I can see it in your eyes
Oh you're an angel
Oh you're an angel
Oh you're an angel in disguise
I can see it in your eyes


You're an angel
You're an angel, baby
You're an angel
You must be an angel, baby


Clouds just disappear
