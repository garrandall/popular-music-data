The night we were dancin' the Strand
We fell in love as if it were planned
You saw me standin’ all alone
We did the Strand
You walked me home
It was so grand
Dancin' the Strand

I'll always remember
How you held me so tight
You kissed me, baby, oh, what a night
The record was playin’ my favorite song
And I was prayin'
That we could dance the whole night long
It was so grand
Dancin' the Strand

I couldn't sleep at all that night
Me and my diary and a little light
I wrote down every little word
You said to me
I'm beggin', beggin', baby-baby
How I pray our love could always be

My prayers were answered
'Cause you’re still here with me
We’ll be together for all eternity
And when we go dancin' hand-in-hand
We always remember that night
We did the Strand
It was so grand
Dancin’ the Strand
