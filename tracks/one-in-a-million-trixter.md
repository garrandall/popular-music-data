Once in your life you'll find someone
To make it all so real
When it comes you will know
'Cuase it's like something
You never thought you'd feel

(And) sometimes you say to yourself
Is this really what I'm looking for ?
'Cause only time will tell
If this is heaven or hell
To really know if you're sure

I walk this lonely road
And I felt I'm goin' nowhere
(And) some things I'll never know
But I know why you're the only one

And I'll never find love again
Like the kind you give
Like the kind you send
'Cuase you're one in a million
One in a million... to me

Baby you've got a certain way
Of doin' things that makes me feel
Like I'm someone
So don't change the way that you are

I walk this lonely road
And I felt I'm goin' nowhere
(And) some things I'll never know
'Cuase you're a million and one

I walk the lonely road
And I felt I'm goin' nowhere
(And) some things I'll never know
But I know why you're the only one

And I'll never find love again
Like the kind you give
Like the kind you send
'Cause you're one in a million
One in a million to me..

No more lonely nights
I'm finally goin' somewhere
And it's all because of you
That I know why
You've always been the only one

And i'll never find love again
Like the kind you give
Like the kind you send'Cause iou're one in a million
One in a million to me

I'll never find love again
Like the kind you give
Like the kind you send
'Cuase you're one in a million
One in a million to me
One in a million to me...
One in a million to me...
One in a million to me...
