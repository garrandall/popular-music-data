I just left Hollywood, California
Our countries have become sewers
Not only Hollywood, there's San Francisco and New York and other cities
But by and large Hollywood
That has filled the land and filled the world with filth

I woke up this mornin'
Couldn't get out of bed
Felt like this heavy band were playin' in my head
They were screamin' through the ceiling
Screamin' through the walls
Stealin' all my photographs and laughing at them all
I phoned the man at work and this is what I said
I woke up this mornin' but I couldn't get out of bed
And I said

You call it poison, but I call it rock and roll
And I said
You call it poison, but I call it rock and roll

A change of style, felt out of place
Got myself a suntan and face-lift for my face
Down to the cat-house
Cruisin' in LA
Found myself a pretty girl with nothin' much to say
Her conversation's like she comes from outer space
Got legs and long hair but I couldn't see her face
And she said

You call it poison, but I call it rock and roll
She said
You call it poison, but I call it rock and roll

This one called the rebel rocker sound
Right!
I sing about guitars, I sing a rocker song
We take a little walk in the New York town

The heavy metal sound is makin' me frown


I takes an hour
Back-combing my hair
Chilling out on heavy grass
And picking clothes to wear
Look in the mirror
Walk out on the street
Bump into a police man I didn't expect to meet
He said to me, hey are you some kind of red
It looks to me son like you just got out of bed
And I said

You call it poison, but I call it rock and roll
And I said
You call it poison, but I call it rock and roll
