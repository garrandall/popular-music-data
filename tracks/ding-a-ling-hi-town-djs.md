Ding-a-ling
Ding-a-ling-a-ling

Chorus:
Gimme a ring-a-ling when you want some ding-a-ling
Just gimme a ring-a-ling when you want some ding-a-ling
Gimme a ring-a-ling when you want some ding-a-ling
I won't hurt your feelings when I give you the ding-a-ling
Freaks of the beats dont worry
Hi town dj's be there in a hurry
You want that bomb
When all you gotta do is hit me up
On the cell phone
Jump on that motorola
Always like Cocacola
When you see Teaze
You'll want me between them knees
And you call me
I'm gonna let you jump on this bomb G
Miss thing let me see you swing
All up on the ding-a-ling
Or better yet baby dont forget
You can hit me up on the internet
Uhh, this is tha bomb
At ding-a-ling dot com
Just gimme a ring-a-ling when you want some ding-a-ling (just gimme a
Ring-a-ling)
I won't hurt your feelings when I give you the ding-a-ling (1-900
Ding-a-ling)
Just gimme a ring-a-ling when you want some ding-a-ling (just gimme a
Ring-a-ling)
I won't hurt your feelings when I give you the ding-a-ling (1-900
Ding-a-ling)
Gimme a ring-a-ling when you want some ding-a-ling
(Just gimme that ring-a-ling when you want some ding-a-ling)
Gimme a ring-a-ling when you want some ding-a-ling
(that ring-a-ling-ding-a-ling that you get from this ding-a-ling)
Just gimme a call on the phone
Let a brotha know when your man gone
Cause I'll be right there with the quickness
Making #1 on my hit list
If it's major hit the pager
Guarenteed Rahming goin slay ya
Rain, shine it be working
You don't play, then I'd be jerkin'
Rump, pump it up
I know just what you want
That ding-a-ling feeling that you get from ding-a-ling
Ain't no ding-a-ling like mine
It'd be workin' over time
Everything gonna be just fine
It won't cost you one spare dime
Come on now
Just gimme a ring-a-ling when you want some ding-a-ling
(when you want some ding-a-ling)
I won't hurt your feelings when I give you the ding-a-ling
(won't hurt your feelings)
Just gimme a ring-a-ling when you want some ding-a-ling
(when you want some ding-a-ling)
I won't hurt your feelings when I give you the ding-a-ling
(1-900 ding-a-ling)
Gimme a ring-a-ling when you want some ding-a-ling
(when you want ding-a-ling-ding, when you want ding-a-ling-ding)
Gimme a ring-a-ling when you want some ding-a-ling
(Just gimme a ring-a-ling when you want that ding-a-ling)
Gimme a ring-a-ling if you want some ding-a-ling, oh-oohh
Gimme a ring-a-ling if you want some ding-a-ling, oh-oh-oh-oh
Gimme a ring-a-ling when you want some ding-a-ling
(Ding-a-ling feeling that you get from ding-a-ling)
Gimme a ring-a-ling when you want some ding-a-ling
(Ding-a-ling feeling that you get from ding-a-ling)
OH, got me some action
Boo-yeh is your reaction

Just gimme a ring-a-ling when you want some ding-a-ling
(Just gimme a ring-a-ling)
I won't hurt your feelings when I give you the ding-a-ling

Just gimme a ring-a-ling when you want some ding-a-ling
(Just gimme a ring-a-ling)
