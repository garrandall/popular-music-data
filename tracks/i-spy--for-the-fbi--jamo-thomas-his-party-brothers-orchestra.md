I spy for the FBI
(I spy for the FBI)
I spy for the FBI
(I spy for the FBI)
I got an x-ray camera hidden in your house
That sees what I can't see
And that man you were kissin' last night
Definitely was not me, oh baby
I spy for the FBI
(I spy for the FBI)
I spy for the FBI
(I spy for the FBI)
Just because he was wearin' shades
You thought he didn't leave a clue
I got his name, I know his game
He's double-0 you know who, oh baby
I spy for the FBI
(I spy for the FBI)
I spy for the FBI
(I spy)
I've got the facts in the file
Baby I don't have to guess
I took that agent's fingerprints
Off of your new red dress, oh baby
I spy for the FBI
(I spy for the FBI)
I spy for the FBI
(I spy for the FBI)
I know when you're out
I know when you're in
I know where you come from
I know where you've been
I know when you're up
I know when you're down
I know when you're in
Baby or out on the town
I spy for the FBI
(I spy for the FBI)
Baby, I spy for the FBI
(I spy for the FBI)
Baby, I spy for the FBI
(I spy for the FBI)
