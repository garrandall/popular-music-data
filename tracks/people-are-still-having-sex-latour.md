Have you noticed that people are still having sex?
All the denouncement had absolutely no effect
Parents and counselors constantly scorn them
But people are still having sex and nothing seems to stop them

Do you realize that people are still having sex?
They've been told not to, perhaps they are perplexed
When you see them holding hands, they are making future plans
To engage in the activity; do you understand me?

People are still having sex
Lust keeps on lurking
Nothing makes them stop;
This AIDS thing's not working

People are still having sex;
It's been going on for quite a while
Perhaps it is quite fashionable
It hasn't gone out of style

It's a fact that people are still having sex;
It's rather obvious, it's just what one expects
The evidence is all around that everyone in every town
Has had it at one time or another in their life

At this very moment, people are still having sex
In a downtown condo or a street in the projects
Even though you can't see them, or hear their breathing sounds
Someone in this world is having sex right now

People are still having sex
People are still having sex
People are still having sex
People are still having sex

Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex...
