Maxine was 5'9''
Had a man, and she didn't mind
Walked up to me nice and slow
What she wanted
I did not know
Gave me her pager number
And said call her "anytime"
Then she whispered in my ear


She said
My body wants you so
For what I miss at home
Nobody has to know
Keep it
On the down and low
She said
My body wants you so
For what I miss at home
Nobody has to know
Keep it
On the down and low

She says that he
Doesn't take her anywhere
Used to say sweet things
Acts like he doesn't even care
He thinks that she's content
Cos he buys her cars
And he pays her rent
But she's not ready to leave
She turned and said to me




I wouldn't treat you that way
If you were my lady
I wouldn't share you
You'd be mine and mine alone, oh yeah
If he continues wastin' your time
Girl, he's crazy
I'll take her
(Got to get down and low)

Maxine looked into my eyes
Wanted me to be the other guy
Cos tonight she's needin' someone to hold
Lonely nights can be, oh, so cold
Deprived of all the things
She misses, wants, wishes, and needs
Got hotter than a hundred and three
She turned and said to me
