You may push me around
But you cannot win
You may throw me down
But I'll rise again
The more you say
The more I defy you
So get out of my face 

You cannot stop us
You cannot bring us down
Never give up
We go on and on
You'll never break us
Never bring us down
We are alive! 

The wind blows
I'll lean into the wind
My anger grows
I'll use it to win
The more you say
The more I defy you
So get out of my way 

All my will
All my strength
Rip it out
Start again 

Can you leave it all behind?
Can you leave it all behind?
Cause you can't go back
You can't go back
