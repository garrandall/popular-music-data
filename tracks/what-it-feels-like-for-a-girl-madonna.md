Girls can wear jeans
And cut their hair short
Wear shirts and boots
Because it's OK to be a boy
But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading
'Cause you think that being a girl is degrading
But secretly you'd love to know what it's like
Wouldn't you?
What it feels like for a girl


Silky smooth
Lips as sweet as candy, baby
Tight blue jeans
Skin that shows in patches


Strong inside, but you don't know it
Good little girls, they never show it
When you open up your mouth to speak
Could you be a little weak?


Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?


Hair that twirls on finger tips so gently, baby
Hands that rest on jutting hips, repenting
Hurt that's not supposed to show
And tears that fall when no one knows
When you're trying hard to be your best
Could you be a little less?


Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?


Strong inside, but you don't know it
Good little girls, they never show it
When you open up your mouth to speak
Could you be a little weak?


Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?


In this world
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
What it feels like in this world?
