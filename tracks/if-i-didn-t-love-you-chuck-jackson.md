You asked me, do I love you?
That's a silly question...
Listen

If I didn't love you
Would I call every day?
If I didn't love you
Would I act this way?
So why do you ask:
Do I really love you?
When it's really so clear
Even strangers can see that I do...
(If I didn't love you, love you.)

If I didn't love you
Would I worry so?
Each and every moon
When you come and you go?
So just ask yourself:
Would I waste my time?
If I didn't love you
Would I hope and pray
You'd be mine..?
(If I didn't love you, love you.)

Oh baby, mmm honey
Oh, mmm, oo baby
I've got to have you, honey

If I didn't love you
Would I miss you this much?
Put heart and soul to rot
Just for your touch?
Would I be a sling
And a fool for your charm?
If I didn't love you
Would I be right here in your arms?
(if I didn't love you, love you)

Baby, if I didn't love you (if I didn't love you, love you)
Sweety, if I didn't love you (if I didn't love you, love you)
