I am through with you
Baby, I refuse to be blue
So let hurt put you in the loser's seat, ha ha yeah
So let hurt put you behind the wheel, ha ha yeah

Shame, shame on me
For thinking that I could possibly be
The exclusive one of your choice
In this world infested with boys

Well, now I know that I am first on your list
And if I leave, I'm gonna be missed
But can't take a chance on you
Why it's so easy to become number two

You see I refuse to be blue
Meaning I'm cutting you loose
So let hurt put you in the loser's seat, ha ha yeah
So let hurt put you behind the wheel yeah yeah

Let you see how it feels (let you see how it feels)
To be un-for-real (to be un-for-real)
Without a love of your own (without a love of your own)
And all your goodies are gone (all your goodies are gone)
And all your goodies are gone (all your goodies are gone)

Oh so good
I admit your love was good
But it don't rectify how I'll cry
If you ever tell me goodbye

You see refuse to be blue
Meaning, I'm, I gotta cut you loose
So let hurt put you in the loser's seat, ha ha yeah
So let hurt put you behind the wheel

Let you see how it feels (let you see how it feels)
To be un-for-real (to be un-for-real)
To be without a love of your own (without a love of your own)
And all your goodies are gone (all your goodies are gone)
All your goodies are gone (all your goodies are gone)
All your goodies are gone
