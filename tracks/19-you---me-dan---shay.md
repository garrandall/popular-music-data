It was our first week
At Myrtle Beach
Where it all began

It was 102Â°
Nothin' to do
Man it was hot
So we jumped in

We were summertime sippin', sippin'
Sweet tea kissin' off of your lips
T-shirt drippin', drippin' wet
How could I forget?

Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin' down
Like the tears we cried
That day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be
The summer of
19 you and me

We had our first dance in the sand
It was one hell of a souvenir
Tangled up, so in love
So, let's just stay right here

'Til the sun starts creepin', creepin' up
Right then I knew
Just what you were thinkin', thinkin' of
When I looked at you

Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin' down
Like the tears we cried
That day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be
The summer of
19 you and me
...you and me

Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful

Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin' down
Like the tears we cried
That day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be
The summer of
19 you and me

First week
Myrtle Beach
Where it all began..
