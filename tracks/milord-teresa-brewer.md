Come on, get wise, Milord
Her lips tell lies, Milord
The girl that you adore
Has found some other guy

She just got bored, Milord
Now you're ignored, Milord
Deep down inside, your pride
Won't let you say goodbye

That Southern belle, Milord
Has got a heart of ice
Love can be done, Milord
As well as paradise

Don't count the past, Milord
Let her get lost, Milord
Her memory can be
A lifetime of regrets

So, let her go, Milord
Come on, relax, be smart
Cause if you don't, you know
She'll only break your heart

Come on, get hip, Milord
And let life rip, Milord
Be sure there's plenty more
Of loving to be done

There's chicks to meet, Milord
With lips as sweet, Milord
And hearts to make or break
Before the race is run

So hit the town, Milord
Come on and be my guest
We'll turn it upside down
And devil takes the rest

Come on, get glad, Milord
Life's not so bad, Milord
Some kinds of other arms
Can make your heart forget
Milord, Milord
