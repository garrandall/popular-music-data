You came and turned and looked my way
What else can I say
Love was in my eyes

You came and made my life complete
With your love so sweet
You gave your love to me
(You gave your love to me)

Take me, take me in your arms
And don't you let me go
I need you more and more
(I need you more and more)

Your love is all ever need
You're my destiny
This love was meant to be

We'll find a paradise for two
A place for me and you
With our love so true
We'll make our dreams come true
(We'll make our dreams come true)

Take me
Take me in your arms
And don't you let me go
I need you more and more
(I need you more and more)

Take me, take me in your arms
And don't you let me go
I need you more and more
(I need you more and more)
