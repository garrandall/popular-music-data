Light from a window
Cold dark and black
Sound from a dream
I was hypnotized
I was paralyzed
I could hardly speak

And baby
Baby
You never realized
That
I could have stood there lost in your eyes
Stood there waiting
And not realized
Love isn't easy
It isn't always kind
I could have stood there
Lost in your eyes

Guess I understand it
Guess I sort of have to
Guess I kind of see
Just because it could have been
Doesn't mean it had to
Ever mean a thing

And baby
Baby
I could say it all the time
That
I could have stood there lost in your eyes
Stood there waiting
And not realized
Love isn't easy
It isn't always kind
I could have stood there
Lost in your eyes

And you know sometimes I wonder
Yes I wonder
I really really do
Ya yes I do
Just because it helps me
Though sometimes it scares me
Guess you wouldn't know
No you wouldn't know

Guess I understand it
Guess I sort of have to
Guess I kind of see
Just because it could have been
Doesn't mean it had to
Ever mean a thing

And baby
Baby
You never realized
I could have stood there lost in your eyes
Stood there waiting
And never realized
Love isn't easy
It isn't always kind
I could have stood there
Lost in your eyes
You know
I could have stood there
Ya ya ya ya
Lost in your eyes
Lost in your eyes
Lost in your eyes
Lost in your eyes
Lost in your eyes
Lost in your eyes
Lost in your eyes
