Strange how you stopped loving me
How you stopped needing me
When she came along
Oh, how strange

Strange you changed like night and day
Just up and walked away
When she came along
Oh, how strange

Well, I guess that I was just your puppet
You held on a string
To think I thought you really loved me
But look what thoughts can bring

Strange you're still in all my dreams
Oh, what a funny thing
I still care for you
Oh, how strange

Well, I guess that I was just your puppet
You held on a string
To think I thought you really loved me
But look what thoughts can bring oh, oh, oh

Strange you're still in all my dreams
Oh, what a funny thing
I still care for you
Oh, how strange
How strange, how strange, how strange...
