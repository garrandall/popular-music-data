Shitted on 'em, man, I just shitted on 'em
Shitted on 'em, put yo' number two's in the air if you did it on 'em
Shitted on 'em, man, I just shitted on 'em
Shitted on 'em, put yo' number two's in the air if you did it on 'em


All these bitches is my sons (my sons)
And I'mma go and get some bibs for 'em
A couple formulas, little pretty lids on 'em
If I had a dick, I would pull it out and piss on 'em (psss)
L-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-let me shake it off
I just signed a couple deals, I might break you off
And we ain't making up, I don't need a mediator
Just let them bums blow steam, - r-r-radiator


(That was a earthquake, bitch!)
Shitted on 'em
(You felt the ground shake, right?)
Man, I just shitted on 'em
(You bitches ain't fucking with her!)
Shitted on 'em
(You must've -- Aaaah!)
P-p-p-put yo' number two's in the air if you did it on 'em
(You must've lost your fucking mind)
Shitted on 'em
(You must've bumped your fucking head!)
Man, I just shitted on 'em
(You crazy, stupid, ugly, monkey-looking bitches!)
Shitted on 'em, put yo' number two's in the air if you did it on 'em
(Aaaah!)


Yo, this stone is flawless, F-F-F1
I keep shooters up top in the F1
A lot of bad bitches beggin' me to eff one
But I'mma eat them rap bitches when the chef come
Th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-throw some fresh one's
More talent in my mu'fuckin' left thumb
She ain't a Nicki fan, then the bitch deaf, dumb
You ain't my son, you my mu'fuckin' step-son


(I don't know what layaway look like)
Shitted on 'em
(Bitch, I can't even spell welfare)
Man, I just shitted on 'em
(You got me mistaken with your mother, ho)
Shitted on 'em
(You bitches at the bottom of the totem pole)
Put yo' number two's in the air if you did it on 'em
(We at the top bitch - She flopped!)
Shitted on 'em
(Louis Vuitton everything, bitch!)
Man, I just shitted on 'em
(Gucci - we don't fuck with it, it's too cheap, motherfucker!)
Shitted on 'em, put yo' number two's in the air if you did it on 'em
(You bitches - Ahhhh Man!)


All these bitches is my sons (sons)
And I ain't talking 'bout Phoenix
Bitch, I get money so I do's what I pleases
I live where the muthafuckin pools and the trees is
Broke bitches so crusty (disgust me)
G-g-g-gave the bitch a ride, got the Continental dusty
Trust me, I keep a couple hundred in the duff-b
Couple wet wipes case a bum try to touch me (ew!)
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm the terminator
Bitch talk slick, I'mma have to terminate her
These little nappy headed hoes need a perminator
Y-y-you my seed, I spray you with the germinator (sh-sh-sh-sh-sh)
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-move back, bugs
Matter fact, you know, the queen could use a back rub (ah!)
If you could turn back time - Cher
You used to be here, now you gone - Nair


(You nappy-headed son of a bitches!)
Shitted on 'em
(I'ma start throwing Just for Me Perm at your heads!)
Man, I just shitted on 'em
(I'ma get the kid version)
Shitted on 'em
(The Kid one, cause you're a bunch of kids)
Put yo' number two's in the air if you did it on 'em
(Bunch of nappy-headed hoes running around)
Shitted on 'em
(Just for Me)
Man, I just shitted on 'em
(You know it, yeah ho, you know)
Shitted on 'em, put yo' number two's in the air if you did it on 'em
(Just for Me Perm, in your head, when we see you! -- OW!)
