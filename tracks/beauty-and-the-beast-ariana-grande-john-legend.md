Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly


Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared

Beauty and the Beast

Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
And ever just as sure
As the sun will rise

Ever just the same

And ever a surprise

Ever as before

And ever just as sure

As the sun will rise


Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song

Bitter-sweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong


Certain as the sun

Certain as the sun

Rising in the east

Tale as old as time

Song as old as rhyme

Beauty and the Beast


Tale as old as time

Song as old as rhyme

Beauty and the Beast

Beauty and...
Beauty and the Beast
