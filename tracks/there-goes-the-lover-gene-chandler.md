(There goes the lover)
(There goes the lover)
There's no need in denying
I know the girls will be crying
Got to bid goodbye
Even though it hurts my pride
You know the fellas
Are jealous, you see
Cause all the girls
Are sweet on me
Here's what they'll be saying
(There goes the lover)
There goes the lover
(There goes the lover)
They're talking bout me
(There goes the lover)
Can't you hear them saying
(There goes the lover)
The girls are broken hearted
For me, they poor grieve
Happy, the guys
Cause they know I'm gonna leave
All the fellas
Know my games uptight
And with the women
I'm right, right, right
Here's what they'll be saying
(There goes the lover)
Talking bout the lover
(There goes the lover)
Can't you hear them saying
(There goes the lover)
They're talking bout me
(There goes the lover)
The guys say I think I'm neat
But when they say it?
The girls know that I'll be gone
And there's no one around
To take my throne
And they need me
(And they need me)
And they need me
(And they need me)
Here's what they'll be saying
(There goes the lover)
Talking bout the lover
(There goes the lover)
Talking bout me
(There goes the lover)
Yeah, talking bout...
