Baby I wan't, all the same things that you want
Baby I need, all the same things you need

When it comes to lovin' you, I can relate
We're two of a kind. I know how you operate
Baby, You are my ritual
Burnin' in my soul. Never let you go
You are my ritual, my ritual baby

I love, all the same things you love
Baby I long for, all the same things you long for. Every night!

When it comes to lovin' you, I can relate
We're two of a kind, honey I know how you operate
Baby, You are my ritual
Burnin' in my soul. Never let you go
You are my ritual, my ritual
Baby, You are my ritual
Burnin' in my soul. Never let you go
You are my ritual

Every night I worship the love we got. There's a bond between us
Every night, I pray to the gods of love..

There's a certain passion, that covers us at night
It's more than one desire. It's a bond that keeps us tight
Images of love, burning in my soul
You are my ritual. I can't let go

When it comes to lovin' you, I can relate
We want the same things. I don't care if you make me wait
We're two of a kind, honey I know how you operate..
Baby, You are my ritual
Burnin' in my soul. Never let you go
You are my ritual, my ritual
Baby, You are my ritual
Burnin' in my soul. Never let you go
You are my ritual, my ritual...
