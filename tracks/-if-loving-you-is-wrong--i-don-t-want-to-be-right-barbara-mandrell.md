If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If being right means being without you
I'd rather live a wrong than right

My mama and daddy say it's a shame
It's a downright disgrace
But as long as I got you by my side
I don't care what my people say

My friends tell me there's no future
In loving a married man
If I can't see you when I want
I'll see you when I can

If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right

Am I wrong to fall
So deeply in love with you
Knowing you got a wife
And two little children
Depending on you too

Am I wrong to hunger
For the gentleness of your touch
Knowing you got somebody else at home
Who needs you just as much

Am I wrong to give my love
To a married man
Am I wrong for trying to hold on
To the best thing I ever had

If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right

Am I wrong to give my love
To a married man
Am I wrong for trying to hold on
To the best thing I ever had

If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right

I don't wanna be right
If it means sleeping without you
I don't wanna be right
If it means sleeping alone at night
I don't wanna be right

If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong
No, I don't wanna be right
