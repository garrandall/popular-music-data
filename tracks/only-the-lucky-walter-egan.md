I had a dream just the other day...
I dreamed that you would never believe in me
I still recall what you had to say
You said that you would always believe in me
Then I woke, as I always do
My dream was gone like darkness from the sky
Felt the pain and I saw the truth...
Only the lucky in love survive

Only the lucky in love survive
Without love, you're just half alive
Only the lucky in love survive
Without love, I'd just as soon die

I gave my love and I gave my best
God only knows how good it felt to try
In the end, I'm alone again...

'Cause only the lucky in love survive

Only the lucky in love survive
Without love, you're just half alive
Only the lucky in love survive
Without love, I'd just as soon die

Only the lucky in love survive
Without love, you're just half alive
Only the lucky in love survive
Without love, I'd just as soon die

Only the lucky and I will survive...
Only the lucky and I will survive...
I will...
