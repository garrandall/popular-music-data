You ask me why, I say why not
Anything is possible, anything can be
Therefore tonight I'll get you hot
You'll feel a passion you never dreamed

And I know you feel I'm overconfident
What kind of man could I be
It's clear to see it's like animal attraction
When you add it up it's just a matter of factions, girl


Something in your eyes told me
That you were looking for a man you could adore
Something in your eyes had given me a sign
And I knew it was on, I knew it was on

You think you're dry, I say you're wet
I can make it possible, I can make it true
And all night long I'll make you sweat
Gonna do a feeling that's long past overdue

And I know you think why so much confidence
What kind of man must I be
It's clear to see it's like adding and subtracting
When you add it up it's just animal attraction



So when I get inside and make you wet
I'll lick you dry
Creamate your body weak
From all the body heat
And like a lion you'll hear me roar
And when I feed it to your body
Make that body get weak some more
I'll take you to the peak
I'll make you wanna scream
And like a lion you'll hear my body
Roar and roar and roar and roar and roar



Anything is possible and anything can be
You can feel a passion you never dreamed of
See it in your eyes
You've given me a sign
And I knew it was on, I knew it was on

It was something in your eyes that took me to feel it
Something in your eyes, and hey, I can see it
Something in your eyes had given me a sign
And I knew it was on, I knew it was on
