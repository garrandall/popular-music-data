Whatcha tryin' a do to my heart?
Whatcha tryin' a do to my heart?
You go around tellin' lies
And now you want to compromise
Whatcha tryin' a do to my heart?

And you better run, you better hide
You better leave from my sight, yeah

Whatcha tryin' a do to my soul?
Whatcha tryin' a do to my soul?
Well, everything I had was yours
And now I'm closin' all the doors
Whatcha tryin' a do to my soul?

And you better run, you better hide
You better leave from my sight, yeah

I love you oh, I love you so
Can't you see it? Don't you know?
I can't stand your alibis
Your tellin' lies, you drive me wild, yeah

I said, what are ya tryin' a do to my head?
Whatcha tryin' a do to my head?
Well, now I've gotta draw the line
'Cause you ain't gonna take my mind
What are ya tryin' a do to my head?

You better run, you better hide
You better leave from my sight

You better run, you better hide
You better leave from my sight
Let me go, yeah

I said go away, and leave me alone
I can't stand you no more
