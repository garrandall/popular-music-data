(Roses are red my love, violets are blue)

A long, long time ago
On graduation day
You handed me your book,
I signed this way.

Roses are red my love,
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet my love
But not as sweet as you.

We dated through highschool
And when the big day came
I wrote into your book
Next to my name.

Roses are red my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet my love
But not as sweet as you.

Is that your little girl
She looks so much like you
Some day some boy will write
In her book too.

Roses are red my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet my love
But not as sweet as you.

Then I went far away
And you found someone new
I read your letter dear
And I wrote back to you.

Roses are red my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet my love
Good luck, may God bless you.
(May God bless you.)...
