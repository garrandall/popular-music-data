Blue boy, that's what they call me
'Cause I'm so lonely, since I lost you,
Blue boy, I'm known as blue boy
You've found a new boy, and now we're through.

I had a twinkle in my eye
When our sweet love was new,
Now all I do is moan and cry
And hunger after you.

Blue Boy, I'll be a blue boy
Until you need me, as I need you.

(I had a twinkle in my eye)
(When our sweet love was new,)
Now all I do is moan and cry
And hunger after you.

Blue Boy, I'll be a blue boy
Until you need me, as I need you.
(Blue boy)
As I need you.
(Blue boy)
