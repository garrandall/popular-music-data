I don't know what she's doing now
Last I heard from her she said
She felt as if she should be dead
I guess in fact she usually does


I never could understand the fact she ain't returned my calls
I was the only one that I told her I loved her through all the flaws
I would always be the one to show her light in the tunnel
I swear to God I need her back, I know she's lost in the jungle
I know she need me, can't believe we grew apart so quick
She loved trees like me, the way the New Eras fit
She loved Tommy Hilfiger, Rugbys, and Adidas
A match made before Heaven, why the feelings have to leave us?
But they didn't leave my heart so fast
I still wish I had her near and had a beer for her glass
Even though I know that's her downfall from the past
Still wanna shop for old time sake if she asks
Little shot of Crown Royale, maybe 151
So if you see her let her know the plan to have us some fun
Well guess what? Today front page of the daily news
My queen betting the beam dead right ? what the fuck?

I don't know what she's doing now
Last I heard from her she said
She felt as if she should be dead
I guess in fact she usually does


Ever see a jawn so confused and assed out?
She'll suck any dude off chasing the cash route
She went from pompoms to kine bud
I watched the innocence transform, obsession to buying drugs
Little Tooty was a cutie, I swear God
Carmel complexion, good grade with a hair bob
Ten years later now she's bobbing to head jobs
In and out of strip clubs like a career job
And she can't see that she's killing herself
Cause a couple dollars got this drunk feeling herself
It's ill how this little girl could be ruthless
She can make a nigga with three degrees look stupid
She even tried to trick a couple dollars from Cupid
Emotionally it'll drain your ass out till you're useless
The price is high when you wanna ride
With a jawn that's suicide, she's a suicide, c'mon

I don't know what she's doing now
Last I heard from her she said
She felt as if she should be dead
I guess in fact she usually does


She said I must confess it turns me on when I cut my flesh
There's nothing left, I'm hollow, I'll follow death
If it's a change from the mundane Mondays
You know my pain, I'm empty inside, my veins pump Novocaine
Sometimes I feel like life isn't real
And my brain is too busy and my mind don't ever heal
I could never shut it off so I'd rather shut it down
Do it right the first time, I ain't trying to fuck around
And she smiles for her friends but the smile is a mask
Any memories of happiness are filed in the past
I can sit in my garage foot revving on the gas
A slash and a gasp or a violent blast
I don't believe in Hell unless it's what I'm in
I wanna free my soul, straight jump out of my skin
She exhaled and sighed, eyes opened wide
Suicide, it's a suicide, biddy-bye-bye

I don't know what she's doing now
Last I heard from her she said
She felt as if she should be dead
I guess in fact she usually does

It's so hard for me to explain
I guess she has a strange approach
It makes her seem beyond reproach
Until you find out what she is
