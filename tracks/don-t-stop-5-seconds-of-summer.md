You're like perfection, some kind of holiday
You got me thinking that we could run away
You want, I’ll take you there
You tell me when and where, oh-oh, oh, oh


But then I asked for your number, said you don’t have a phone
It’s getting late now, I gotta let you know
That everybody wants to take you home tonight
But I’m gonna find a way to make you mine


Don’t stop doing what you’re doing
Every time you move to the beat
It gets harder for me
And you know it, know it, know it
And don’t stop 'cause you know that I like it
Every time you walk in the room
You got all eyes on you
And you know it, know it, know it


You're coming close now, swear I can taste it
You got me tongue-tied, I can't escape it
I’m loving what you got
But then you push me off, oh-oh, oh, oh


And everybody wants to take you home tonight
But I’m gonna find a way to make you mine


Don’t stop doing what you’re doing
Every time you move to the beat
It gets harder for me
And you know it, know it, know it
And don’t stop 'cause you know that I like it
Every time you walk in the room
You got all eyes on you
And you know it, know it, know it


Every day it’s the same
All the games that you play
Back and forth, round and round
Kinda like it this way
Don’t stop doing what you’re doing
'Cause everytime you move to the beat
It gets harder for me
And you know it, know it, know it


Don’t stop 'cause you know that I like it
Every time you walk in the room
You got all eyes on you
And you know it, know it, know it, know it
Don’t stop
Don’t stop, stop what you’re doing
Doing what you're doing
'Cause you know that, you know that I like it
Everytime you move to the beat
It gets harder for me
And you know it, know it, know it
And don’t stop 'cause you know that I like it
You know that I like it
Every time you walk in the room
You got all eyes on you
And you know it, know it, know it
