(One girl)
Said I want one girl
Oh, just one girl
That's all I need
Shouldn't there be someone
In this whole wide world
Who would be so happy
Just to be my girl
If I held her, she'd know
I'd never, never, never
Let her go
All I want is one girl
I said just one girl
Oh, just one girl
That's all I need
All my friends keep talking
Bout all the good times
How they keep on getting girls
With all those fast lines
But that's not for me
Oh, I, I just wanna be
In love with one girl
I said one girl
Oh, just one girl
That's all I need
If I held her, she'd know
I'd never, never, never
Let her go
All I want is one girl
I said just one girl
Oh, just one girl
That's all I need
I want to let the world know
I just want one girl
Oh, just one girl...
