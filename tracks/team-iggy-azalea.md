Iggs
Look


Turn me up, break the knob right
I get dressed like it's prom night
I feed them lemons in the limelight
They say I'm full, lost my appetite?!
(Hell nah) Keep on pushing like a dealer (say what?)
(Hell nah) Keep on shooting, Reggie Miller (say what?)
(Hell nah) Go and give 'em all the finger
You gotta set the score right, call it Hans Zimmer
My time wherever I go
I took a chance like I'm from Chicago
100+ in that Murcielago
Bout to go ape, hey! Turn it to the congo


Baby I got me, baby I got me
Yeah, that's all I need
Yeah that's all I need
Baby I got me, only friend I need
Playing on my team is someone like
Me, baby, no way
Watch me while I do my thing
Oh, baby, no way
Are you fucking with the team?


Outchea, pronto
Hit 'em with the dose, that's a combo
Running through ya block, no fumble
Bout to kill 'em all, where the shovel?
See I gotta go for mine
Benja-jammin', that money on my mind
Jamaican club, I'm stayin' on the grind
Dutty wine, don't step on this land mine
Ven aqui, andele
You tryna take flight? Do what I say
100+ Vogues on the highway
Watch a new car dash, call me Kylie


Baby I got me, baby I got me
Yeah, that's all I need
Yeah that's all I need
Baby I got me, only friend I need
Playing on my team is someone like
Me, baby, no way
Watch me while I do my thing
Oh, baby, no way
Are you fucking with the team?


Are you workin' with some cash here, cash here?
100,000 on the dash yeah, dash yeah
All my ladies shake it fast yeah, fast yeah
Now vogue on that ass, yup! Yeah we in here
Are you workin' with some cash here, cash here?
100,000 on the dash yeah, dash yeah
All my ladies shake it fast yeah, fast yeah
Now vogue on that ass, yup! Yeah we in here


Baby I got me, baby I got me
Yeah, that's all I need

Baby I got me, only friend I need
Playing on my team is someone like
Me, baby, no way
Watch me while I do my thing
Oh, baby, no way
Are you fucking with the team?
