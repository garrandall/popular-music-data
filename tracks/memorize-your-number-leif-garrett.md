Just let me look at you now
Dont you say a word
I want to remember the first time we met

Before you move in with me
And move out a year from now
Dont forget that I told it's perfect
But you spoiled it somehow

Chorus
Oh, I don't (wanna memorize your number)
Don't want my heart to die
Every time I call and you're not there
(Memorize your number)
Dont want the pain to remain way down inside me
When you say goodbye

You say the words to me like
I haven't heard them before
Log on to kill this message.
I will want to believe
? Fall through the door
And after you've taken them back
Dont forget they been saying
Dont deny I exist inside of your heart
Inside of your head


How can we stay like this
This is the passion forever
Hold back and taste that first kiss
We both know there's nothing better

Chorus 3x
