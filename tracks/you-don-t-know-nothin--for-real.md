Ah...oh


You know the sun comes up in the morning (Hm, Hm)
And that, summer comes June (Hm, Hm)
You know that, rain comes out from the sky (Hm, Hm)
And it makes the flowers bloom (Hm, Hm)

But you don't know nothin'
'Til you know that I love you (You)
Boy I luv you
Said you don't know nothin'
'Til you know that I love you (You)
'Til you know I love you


Hm, you know that one plus one equals two (Yeah, do)
And that two times two is four (do, do)
You know that roses are red (do, do)
And violets are blue (do, do)
But you can stand to learn a little more (do, do)

'Cause you don't know nothin'
'Til you know that I love you (You)
Boy I love you
Said you don't know nothin'
'Til you know that I love you
You

Baby I know
I know I, can reach you
I'll show you, I'll teach you
'Cause you don't know nothin'
'Til you know that I love you (You)
'Till you know, you know that I love you!


You know I love long walks in the park (You know, I do)
Like the ones we always say (I do, Love you)
You know I love long talks in the dark (Love you, I do)
And how it makes us stay away (Love you, You know)

But you don't know nothin'
'Til you know that I love you
You (I do)
Boy I love you
Said you don't know nothin'
'Til you know that I love you (You)

Baby I know
I know I, can reach you
I'll show you, I'll teach you
'Cause you don't know nothin'
'Til you know that I love you (You)

Baby if you
Just follow the yurning
Then soon you'll be learning!
'Cause you

Don't, don't, don't know nothing

Know nothin'--------Youu Don't

Know nothin'--you don't know

Yooou don't know nothin'

Don't...


Know nothin'
'Til you know that I love...


Yooou don't know nothin'
Don't, don't, don't know nothing
Know nothin'--------Youu Don't
Know nothin'--you don't know

Don't...


Know nothin'
'Til you know that I love...


Yooou don't know nothin'
Don't, don't, don't know nothing
Know nothin'--------Youu Don't
Know nothin'--you don't know

Don't...


Know nothin'
'Til you know
'Til you know
'TIL YOU KNOW!
'Til you know that I love
YOU!
