Yeah
Like this
Where you at Shawty?


You fly as hell, swagga right, brown skin poppin'
You know just how to talk to me, know just how I like it
You turnin' me on, you turnin' me on, you turnin' me on
Now wait a minute, little buster
You got one more time to feel on my booty
Better recognize a lady that ain't the way you do me
You turnin' me off, you turnin' me off
You turnin' me off
Better recognize a real woman


(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
You ever try to get that close to me
You better come correct how you 'proachin' me
Dime divas, give it to me
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I gotta be feelin' your energy
I gotta be for sure that you're into me
Recognize a real woman


Goin' up on it, you actin' like you want it
And you stuntin' like your daddy, checkin' for this little mama
You turnin' me on, you turnin' me on, you turnin' me on
Now wait a minute, little buster
Now you don't even know me but you wanna take me shopping
You a lame, I can tell it ain't big shit poppin'
You turnin' me off, you turnin' me off
You turnin' me off
Better recognize a real woman


All you wanna do is holla at the cutest broad
To get up in them draws, got money, don't try to buy me
Bottles, got my own dollars I could buy up the bar if I want it


(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
You ever try to get that close to me
You better come correct how you 'proachin' me
Dime divas, give it to me
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I gotta be feelin' your energy
I gotta be for sure that you're into me
Recognize a real woman


Ah, ah, ah, oh, hah
I'm fly as hell, swagger right
Brown skin poppin' like dynamite
Raw like China white, mami I
Dig your persona right
You look baby mama type
I know that got you kinda hyped
My ice is albino white
I hope your vagina tight
I go underwater and
I hope your piranha bite (Haha)
Hot Carter, I'mma kiss the spot for you
And I'mma kiss it till you scream
Wait a minute motherfucker, ha
Yeah, I turn you on like a handle
Like a television on the Weather Channel
'Cause I make it rain, girl
Now call me Wayne, girl
You just an Earthling, you ain't never been to Wayne's World
I play to win, I bait 'em in
I do my thing now you're in love with an alien
Polow on the beat and Weezy F, I'm at the plate again
Keri, if you pitch it at me, I'ma swing away at it
Someone better play the fence
Someone better tell them 'bout me
Baby, I'm the shit
And that's the only thing you smell around me
Weezy F baby, don't forget the F around me
And if you do then get the F from round me


You're turnin' me off (Ha, ha), yeah, yeah
Polow, I told you I got you
Ms. Keri, baby (Ms. Keri Baby)


(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
You ever try to get that close to me
You better come correct how you 'proachin' me
Dime divas, give it to me
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I gotta be feelin' your energy
I gotta be for sure that you're into me
Recognize a real woman


Yeah
Ms. Keri, baby
And Young Weezy, baby
Hey, yo, keep all my vocals too Polow, man
Yeah!
