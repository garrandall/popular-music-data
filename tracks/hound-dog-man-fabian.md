Hound dog man, hound dog man, i wanna be a hound dog man

I'm gonna get me an ol' hound dog
I'm gonna let 'im lead the way
Then i'm gonna turn 'im loose
We'll go huntin' every day
That's the kind of life for me
There's one thing i wanna be, and that's a
Hound dog man, hound dog man, i wanna be a hound dog man

I'm wanna get up in the mornin'
A-yeah, with the risin' sun
I'm gonna stay right on that trail
Till the day is done
I think i am old enough
I'm young in years but i'm mighty tough, a-like a
Hound dog man, hound dog man, i wanna be a hound dog man

I'm lookin' for a girl who'll be waitin' when i come home
She's gonna meet me with a kiss
She's gonna be one pretty miss
And every time i go, she gonna miss-a me more and more
She's gonna have a tear in her eye, the time's gonna pass so slow

That's the kind of life for me
A-there's one thing i wanna be, and that's a
Hound dog man, hound dog man, i wanna be a hound dog man

And every time i go, she gonna miss-a me more and more
She's gonna have a tear in her eye, the time's gonna pass so slow

That's the kind of life for me
A-there's one thing i wanna be, and that's a
Hound dog man, hound dog man, i wanna be a hound dog man
Hound dog man, hound dog man, i wanna be a hound dog man
Hound dog man
Hound dog man
