I used to think that I was made of stone, I only wanted to be on my own
It gets so lonely when you're all alone and you just can't take anymore

Look at the passion in my eyes tonight
Comin at you through the clear moonlight
I want a lover who can hold on tight til I just can't take anymore


Give me no heavenly knight, make him a devil in a fast car
Send me no angel in white, I want it just the way that you are

Other eyes are watching everywhere
Tryin' hard to catch us but I just don't care
I gotta touch you just to prove you're there, not some dream I had before

Here comes that feeling that I can't understand
Can't put it in the back, can't hold it in my hand
Gave all the love time on those one-night-stands
Just to see what lies in the store



Flyin' east to the risin' sun, for ninety minutes I'll be under the gun
I'll dream about you while I'm on the run til I just can't dream anymore
