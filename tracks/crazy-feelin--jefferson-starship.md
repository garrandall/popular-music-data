I love you so you'll never know 
don't ever stop believing 
out of out minds time after time 
it's such a crazy feelin' 

Feelin' good feelin' high 
feel so free I wanna fly 
feel the sun feel the ground 
feel it just go round and round 

I wanna stay day after day 
and just a little longer 
you close to me I gotta be 
you know the love gets stronger 

Ooo turnin' like a wheel 
changin' it to real 
whenever we are one 
it's true it's always me and you 
thru any kinda weather...
