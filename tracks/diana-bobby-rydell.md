I'm so young and you're so old
This, my darling, I've been told
I don't care just what they say
'Cause forever I will pray

You and I will be as free
As the birds up in the trees
Oh, oh, please stay by me

Only you, only you can take my heart
Only you, only you can tear it apart
When you hold me in your loving arms
I can feel you giving all your charms

Hold me, darling (hold me, darling)
Hold me tight (hold me tight)
Love me, baby (love me, baby)
With all your might
Oh, oh, please stay by me
Diana (Diana)

Oh, my love, my darling
Stay by me, Diana (Diana)
Oh, Diana (Diana)
Mmm, Diana (Diana)
