I heard me a sermonette, have you heard it yet
With that soulful message that you won't soon forget
It tells about real true love, the kind people lost sight of
Through their sinful livin', and their scornin' Heaven above

It tells you to love one another because each one is your brother
Live right 'cause you know you gotta reap just what you sow

And so to have no regrets and to find what you're missin'
Bow your head and listen to this sermonette

It tells you to love one another, you know each one is your brother
Live right 'cause you know one day you gotta reap everything you sow

And so to have no regrets and to find what you're missin'
Come on along and listen to this sermonette
