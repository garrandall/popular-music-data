I've said it before, I'll say it again
I'll sing it over and over
I love you
Don't worry 'bout those little troubles we're in
Listen over and over
To 'I love you'

Girl, look in my eyes
There's a place for you inside my heart
And you'll never have to question it
You can count on it
Baby, rely on it

Girl, no more lonely nights
You lyin' here beside me safe in my arms
We can chase the gloomy clouds away
Keep the doubts at bay 'cause, baby, you're mine

I've said it before, I'll say it again
I'll sing it over and over
I love you
Don't worry 'bout those little troubles we're in
Listen over and over
To 'I love you'
Girl

You know I love you
And I don't know what I'd do without you
You and me
I think together we should be

Girl, no more lonely nights
You lyin' here beside me safe in my arms
We can chase the gloomy clouds away
Keep the doubts at bay 'cause, baby, you're mine

I've said it before, I'll say it again
I'll sing it over and over
I love you
Don't worry 'bout those little troubles we're in
Just listen over and over
To 'I love you'

Girl, your smile the sun oughta see
He might just think you're the new star to be
I say girl you're amazing, you're my special lady
You know I'm gonna love you for the rest of my life

Oh, girl
Say it again
I'll sing it over and over
I love you
Don't worry 'bout those little troubles we're in
Just listen over and over
To 'I love you'

I've said it before, I'll say it again
I'll sing it over and over
I love you
Don't worry 'bout those little troubles we're in
Just listen over and over
To 'I love you'

I've said it before, I'll say it again
I'll sing it over and over
I love you
Don't worry 'bout those little troubles we're in
Just listen over...
