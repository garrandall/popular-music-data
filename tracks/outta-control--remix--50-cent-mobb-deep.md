It's the Infamous Mobb, M-O-B-B
We can't be touched nigga, can't you see (G-Unit)


You do you man cause me I'm 'gon do my thing, you know I do my thing
I'mma get my drink on and party like it's ok


Trust me man it's ok, bounce with me in slow mo
When they hear the kid in the house they're like, "Oh no"
50 got 'em locin again, they open again
Got 'em sipping on that juice and gin
You could find me in the background burning that Backwood
Styling and stunting, doing my two step fronting
Now I'mma tell you what Em told me, homey
Just lose the parental discretion's advised, this is grown folk music
Now blend in with me, as I proceed to break it down
It's always off the chain man when I'm around
I play the block bumping, it was all for the dough
I get the club jumping, cause I'm sick with flow
You know it's sold out, like wherever I go
I jam packed the show man that's for sure
I got the info you already know
Man I get it popping in the club, everybody show me love, let's go


You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now shorty let's get into it
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now homey let's get into it


You wanna search me for certain but hurry up cause I'm thirsty
I need that, grind in my system P, on my side twisting
In the club today for the chick to go both
Ways, let me see that ID just for proof
With the drink til the burn is gone
Hit the dancefloor like a scene from soft porn
Before it pop, make em sign a disclaimer
Try to get me on some Pac shit these tricks will frame ya
But, in any event, keep fucking with 50 it makes sense
Cents, into them dollars, the hoes wanna holler
But you lookin at a nigga that done came from the squalor
Now my buddy so gone I can pop your collar
Now If I donâ€™t say nothin, let me see you swallow
In my crib got the co-ed back the new problem
In the club feed them liquor of the wise I'm starving
So much green gettin twisted like Botanical Garden, let's go


You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now shorty let's get into it
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now homey let's get into it


You already know how it go, I bang, I shine
I play, I stay I'm going for mine
I'm young, I'm black, I'm rich and yes
I'm ghetto than the motherfucking project steps
I'm cool, I'm calm you looking real stressed
I'm strapped I'm armed kid, hold your head
I'm known for gat popping, when I got problems
I don't run, I just gun you all up
But we ain't come here to start no drama
We just looking for our future baby mamas
With money with face with style and body
I cook I clean I swear that mami
Just as long as you don't go off and tell nobody
I go down low, I'm lying I'm trying my best to let you know
Sugar pop get at P
The Doc beat make it easy to get 'em in the bed sheets


You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now shorty let's get into it
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now homey let's get into it
