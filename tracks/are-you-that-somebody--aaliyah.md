Dirty South, can y'all really feel me
East Coast, feel me
West Coast, feel me
Dirty South, can y'all really feel me
East Coast, feel me

Dirty South, can y'all really feel me

West Coast, feel me
Dirty South, can y'all really feel me
East Coast, feel me
West Coast, feel me


Boy, I've been watching you like a hawk in the sky
That flies, and you were my prey (my prey)
Boy, I promise you if we keep bumpin' heads
I know that one of these days (days)
We gon' hook it up, pro'ly talk on the phone
But see, I don't know if that's good
I've been holdin' back this secret from you
I probably shouldn't tell it, but if I


If I let you know
You can't tell nobody, I'm talkin' bout nobody
Are you responsible?
Boy I gotta watch my back, cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go? Is it your go?
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no
Cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody?


Boy, won't you pick me up at the park right now
Up the block, while everyone (Sleep, sleeps, sleeps)
I'll be waiting there with my trench, my locs, my hat
Just so I'm lowkey
If you tell the world
(Don't speak, you know that would be weak)
Oh boy, see I'm trusting you with my heart, my soul
I probably shouldn't let you but if I


If I let this go
You can't tell nobody, I'm talkin' bout nobody
I hope you're responsible
Boy I gotta watch my back, cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go? Is it your go?
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now I'm naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no
Cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody


Baby girl, I'm the man from the big VA
Won't you come play round my way
And listen to what I gotta say
Timbaland (what) don't you know I am the man
Rock shows here to Japan
Have people shaking my--shaking my hand
Baby girl, better known as Aaliyah
Give me goosebumps and high fevers
Makin' playa haters believers
Don'tcha know, gotta tell somebody, cause


Cause I really need somebody (What?)
Tell me you're that somebody (What?)


If I let this go
You can't tell nobody, I'm talkin' bout nobody
Are you responsible?
Boy I gotta watch my back, cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go? Is it your go?
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now I'm naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no
Cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody?

You can't tell nobody, I'm talkin' bout nobody
I hope you're responsible
Boy I gotta watch my back, cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go? Is it your go?
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no
Cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody?

Is it my go, is it your go
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now I'm bout naughty naughty
Cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody
