People always rushing round
Makin' time to fuss and to worry
Get your feet back on the ground
It's no good to live in a hurry


Take it easy on your mind
No one wants to get behind
Think about it, you will find
Time is on your side, slow down baby
(Can't slow down)
Slow down baby
(Can't slow down)


Things around you change so fast
Livin' day to day is confusin', whoa
And how long will the good times last
Thinking you're on top when you're losin'?


I'll say it, take it easy in your mind
No one wants to get behind
Think about it, you will find
Time is on your side, slow down baby, yeah
(Can't slow down)
Slow down woman
(Can't slow down)
Slow down baby
(Can't slow down)
Baby won't you please slow down
Come on, yeah!
Pick it up, pick it up

Things around you change so fast
Livin' day to day is confusin', whoa
And how long will the good times last
Thinking you're on top when you're losin'?
Yeah


Take it easy in your mind
No one wants to get behind
Think about it, you will find
Time is on your side, slow down baby, oh
(Can't slow down)
Slow down baby
(Can't slow down)
Slow down woman
(Can't slow down)
Baby won't you please slow down


You got to, you got to
(Can't slow down)
Woo! You got to, you got to
(Can't slow down)
Slow down baby, yeah yeah yeah

Baby won't you, one time
All you gotta do, all you gotta do

I say, all you gotta do, all you gotta do
(Can't slow down)
I say, all you gotta do, all you gotta do
