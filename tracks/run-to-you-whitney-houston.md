I know that when you look at me
There's so much that you just don't see
But if you would only take the time
I know in my heart you'd find
Oh, a girl who's scared sometimes
Who isn't always strong
Can't you see the hurt in me?
I feel so all alone


I want to run to you
I want to run to you
Won't you hold me in your arms
And keep me safe from harm?
I want to run to you
But if I come to you
Tell me, will you stay or will you run away


Each day, each day I play the role
Of someone always in control
But at night I come home and turn the key
There's nobody there, no one cares for me
Oh what's the sense
Of trying hard to find your dreams
Without someone to share it with
Tell me what does it mean?


I want to run to you
I want to run to you
Won't you hold me in your arms
And keep me safe from harm?
I want to run to you
But if I come to you
Tell me, will you stay or will you run away
Run away


I need you here
I need you here to wipe away my tears
To kiss away my fears, no
If you only knew how much


I want to run to you
I want to run to you
Won't you hold me in your arms
And keep me safe from harm?
I want to run to you
But if I come to you
Tell me, will you stay or will you run away
