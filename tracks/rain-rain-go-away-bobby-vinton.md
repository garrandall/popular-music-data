I can still remember 
When you moved in next door 
I brought you some choc'late 
From the corner candy store 
When it started raining 
You started crying too 
That was the first time 
I sang this song to you 

Rain rain go away 
Come again some other day 
Rain rain go away 
Bring my love a sunny day 

We grow up together 
And as the years went by 
Ev'rybody knew that we were 
Sweethearts you and I 
Through many april showers 
I held your hand in mine 
Between the raindrops 
We sang time after time 

Rain rain go away 
Come again some other day 
Rain rain go away 
Bring my love a sunny day 

I went away to college 
You said you'd wait for me 
Then I got your letter 
Asking me to set you free 
Tomorrow you'll be maried 
There's nothing I can do 
But wish you sunshine 
Now and your whole life through 

Rain rain go away 
Tomorrow is her wedding day 
Rain rain go away 
Bring my love a sunny day
