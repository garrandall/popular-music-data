In order to play with this record
You must tune your bass to ours
(Look out!)
One, two, three, four, hit it!
Rock the house, y'all!


Let the beat hit 'em
Let the music take control
The beat goes round
And round and up and down and
Let the beat hit 'em
Got to learn to let go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go


Let the beat hit 'em
Let the music take control
The beat goes round
And round and up and down and
Let the beat hit 'em
Got to learn to let go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

Alright!
(This sequence is repeated several times
Listen to it from a location midway between the loudspeakers.)
One, two, three, bass!
L.L., get funky


Everybody's movin' to the beat
Jam is pumpin', got to move my feet
So I use the music to try and get away
From the strain and the pressure
The DJ comes to my rescue
You feel the beat, you've got to move to
The people screamin', yellin' on the floor
Saying please mister DJ (Oww!)

Stereo Stereo Stereo Stereo
Stereo Stereo Stereo Stereo
Let's have some fun
Rock the house, y'all!
It's time to move
It's time to move (Gotcha!)
It's time to move
It's time (Shut up and dance)

Can you dig that?
Yeah, man, I can dig it

Can you feel the beat?
Can you feel the beat?
Moving and grooving
Way down deep inside

Lemme hear you say
Hey hey hey yeah, Hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah
(All together now!)
Hey hey hey yeah, Hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey yeah (Yes, baby, yes, baby)
Hey hey hey yeah, Hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah


Let the beat hit 'em
Let the music take control
The beat goes round
And round and up and down and
Let the beat hit 'em
Got to learn to let
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go


Let the beat hit 'em
Let the music take control
The beat goes round
And round and up and down and
Let the beat hit 'em
Got to learn to let
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

Keep moving, keep grooving
Moving, grooving, moving, grooving
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah


Let the beat hit 'em
Let the music take control
The beat goes round
And round and up and down and
Let the beat hit 'em
Got to learn to let
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go


Let the beat hit 'em
Let the music take control
The beat goes round
And round and up and down and
Let the beat hit 'em
Got to learn to let
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

That's enough
What will people say???
