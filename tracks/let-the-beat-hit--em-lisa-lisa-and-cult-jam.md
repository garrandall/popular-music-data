In order to play with this record
You must tune your bass to up
Look out
One, two, three, four, hit it

Rock the house, y'all

Let the beat hit 'em
Let the music take control
The beat goes round and round
And up and down and let the beat hit em
Got to learn to let go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, all right

Get away me fun
Rock the house, y'all

It's time to move, it's time to move
He, he, he, hey, yeah, he, he, hey, yeah

The beat goes round and round
And up and down and let the beat hit em
Got to learn to let go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go

Keep movin' and round
And up and down and let the beat hit em
Got to learn to let go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go

There's enough
What will the people say?
