Run, run baby run
Run baby run
Run baby run
Run baby run (oh come back to me)
Run baby run (bring your kisses to me)
Run baby run
Back into my arms
Run baby run (I need you baby)
Run baby run (I don't mean maybe)
Run baby run
Back into my arms
And even though you hurt me
I still love you
It's true
Even though I know that you will hurt me again
I will love you
As I did then so
Run baby run (if you love me)
Run baby run (I still want you only)
Run baby run
Back into my arms
Run, run baby run
Run baby run
Run baby run
Back into my arms
I'm not the kind of guy to ever hurt you or let you down
So if that guy you're seeing ever lets you down, leave him
Tell him goodbye and
Run baby run (oh hurry baby)
Run baby run (I'll be waiting for you) run baby run
Back into my arms
Run, run baby run (comon comon baby)
Run baby run (I'm waiting for you)
Run baby run (bring your kisses to me)
Run baby run...
