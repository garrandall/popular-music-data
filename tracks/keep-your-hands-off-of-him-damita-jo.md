Take your hands off of him
He don't belong to you
Take your hands off of him
He don't belong to you
Well, he's mine, all mine
No matter what you do
He's a tal, lean lad
Sweet as he can be
Hands off of him
He belongs to me
Hands off of him
He don't belong to you
Well, he's mine, all mine
No matter what you do
He treats me kind of gentle
Makes me feel so good
Loves me all the time
Like a good man should
Hands off him
He don't belong to you
Woo, he's mine, all mine
No matter what you do
People stand and wonder
What his love is like
Hands off of him
Unless you wanna fight
Hands off of him
He don't belong to you
Well, he's mine, all mine
No matter what you do
Now he'll be mine
Until the day I die
And now you've heard my story
And you know the reason why
Hands off of him
He don't belong to you
Cause he's mine, all mine
No matter what you do
Hands off him
He's mine, all mine
No matter what you do
