One step behind don't make you what you're worth
Blue collar pride, breathing that salty earth
Pay every price, can't keep that dollar bill
It ain't much desire when you're done, lost your will

Talkin' 'bout bad times
Here in these sad times

Too old to try, ain't young enough to split
Cop what you can, get yourself over it
That border line don't really bother me
It ain't what you are, it's what you got to be

Talkin' 'bout bad times
Here in these sad times
That six and one, better than nothing at all
Not for the break that don't ever come

Talkin' 'bout bad times and bad times
Can you dig it?
Talkin' 'bout bad times and bad times
Gonna get you old

Talkin' 'bout bad timin', bad timin'
Bad times, and bad times
Gonna get you old

Don't pray enough to spend the night and wait
Standing too long before it's gets far too late
That ain't your pride, don't burn no candlelight
Ain't not a trip, you got to get old to die

Talkin' 'bout bad times
Here in these sad times
That six and one, better than nothing at all
Not for the break that don't ever come

Talkin' 'bout bad times and bad times
Can you dig it?
Talkin' 'bout bad times and bad times
Gonna get you old

Talkin' 'bout bad timin', bad timin'
Bad times and bad times
Gonna get you old

Talkin' 'bout bad times
Here in these sad times
That six and one, better than nothing at all
Not for the break that don't ever come

Talkin' 'bout bad times and bad times
Can you dig it?
Talkin' 'bout bad times and bad times
Gonna get you old

Talkin' 'bout bad timin', bad timin'
Bad times and bad times
Gonna get you old

I'm talkin' to you, you're talkin' to me
In these sad, sad times

Bad times, bad times
Can you dig, dig, dig, dig, d, dig it
Bad times, bad times
Can you dig, dig, dig, dig it

Bad times, bad times
Can you dig, dig, dig, dig, d, dig it
Bad times, bad times
Can you dig it?

Let's talk about good times, good times
Can you dig it?
Let's talk about good times, good times
Can you dig it?

Let's talk about good times, good times
Can you dig it?
Let's talk about good times, good times
Can you?
