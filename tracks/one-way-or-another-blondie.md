One way or another I'm gonna find you
I'm gonna get you, get you, get you, get you
One way or another I'm gonna win you
I'm gonna get you, get you, get you, get you

One way or another I'm gonna see you
I'm gonna meet you, meet you, meet you, meet you
One day, maybe next week
I'm gonna meet you, I'm gonna meet you, I'll meet you

I will drive past your house
And if the lights are all down
I'll see who's around

LET'S GO

One way or another I'm gonna find you
I'm gonna get you, get you, get you, get you
One way or another I'm gonna win you
I'll get you, I'll get you
One way or another I'm gonna see you
I'm gonna meet you, meet you, meet you, meet you
One day, maybe next week
I'm gonna meet you, I'll meet you, I'll meet you

And if the lights are all out
I'll follow your bus downtown
See who's hanging out

(One, two, three, four)

Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na

I wanna hold you, wanna hold you tight
I wanna hold you, wanna hold you tight
I wanna hold you, wanna hold you tight
Yeah, teenage kicks right through the night

C'mon

I wanna hold you, wanna hold you tight
I wanna hold you, wanna hold you tight
I wanna hold you, wanna hold you tight
Yeah, teenage kicks right through the night

One way or another I'm gonna see you
I'm gonna meet you, meet you, meet you, meet you
One way or another I'm gonna win you
I'm gonna get you, get you, get you, get you
(I wanna hold you, wanna hold you tight)
One way or another I'm gonna see you
(I wanna hold you, wanna hold you tight)
I'm gonna meet you, meet you, meet you, meet you
(I wanna hold you, wanna hold you tight)
One way or another I'm gonna win you
(I wanna hold you, wanna hold you tight)
I'm gonna get you, get you, get you, get you
(I wanna hold you, wanna hold you tight)
One way or another I'm gonna see you
(I wanna hold you, wanna hold you tight)
I'm gonna meet you, meet you, meet you, meet you
(I wanna hold you, wanna hold you tight)
One way or another I'm gonna win you
(I wanna hold you, wanna hold you tight)
I wanna get you, get you, get you, get you
One way or another
