Darling, darling darling,
I'll never understand how sometimes
Just the way you look at me
Can tear my heart
But then again
Darling, darling, darling
Don't look across the room
Cuz you might catch me looking at you
Should we know what to say
Or what to do
So hold on
Don't turn away
There must be a hundred things
We forgot to say

How can we touch
With our hands tied
When only you know
How much you keep me satisfied

How can we explain

This photo play locked up inside

With our hands tied?

Darling, darling, darling
You think this love is blind
Just remember
Each time you squeeze her hand
You crush my heart
Oh and you just could be
Driving me out of my mind
Darling, darling, darling
I'll never let it show

As long as you go on leaving me
I'll just fall apart each time you go

So hold on
Don't take my heart away

She may be one good reason to leave
But I'm a hundred reasons to stay

How can we touch
With our hands tied
When only you know
How much you keep me satisfied
How can we explain
This photo play locked up inside
With our hands tied?
