Well your actin' like a prima donna
Playin' so hard to get
Actin' so cool and nonchalant
Draggin' on a cigarette

You keep a wall all around ya
I'll get through some day
I want your love babe, but push don't shove
Gonna chip that stone away

Chip away
Chip away at the stone
And I won't stop until your love is my very own
Chip away
That's what I'm gonna do
Sweet little mama I wanna get next to you

Well you stand like a marble statue
Trying to look so hard
All decked out in your antique dress
While the boys all promenade

Even a rock will crumble
If you strike it night and day
If hammer I must, I'm gonna get through your crust
Gonna chip that stone away

Chip away
Chip away at the stone
And I won't stop until your love is my very own
Chip away
That's what I'm gonna do
Sweet little mama I wanna get next to you

Chip away
Chip away at the stone
And I won't stop until your love is my very own
Chip away
That's what I'm gonna do
Sweet little mama I wanna get next to you
Oh...yes I do...

Chip away
Chip away
At the stone
Chip away
Chip away
At the stone

I won't stop
I won't stop
I won't stop
I won't stop
I won't stop

I won't stop
I won't stop
I won't stop
I won't stop
I won't stop
Won't stop

Chip it, I'm gonna nip it, all night long
