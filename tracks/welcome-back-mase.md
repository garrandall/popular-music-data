Welcome back, welcome back
Welcome back.

Weclome back (Oh! Oh!)
Yeah man, how you doin' (Come on, come on, come on)
You good? I know you like that (Yeah you good, you doin' good)
I know you like that (Oh!)
How long you been back man?

Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome back

I see the girls in the club, they gettin' wild for me
And all the pretty chicks all wanna smile at me
These rap cats man they all got they style from me
And if I ever seen them then they probably bow to me
And when this beat - drop I know they gon' lean
World debut, I know they gon' fiend
Everything, Mississippi to the Palm Springs
Girls from brunettes down to blonde queens
These young boys don't know what a don mean
I'm just a bad boy gone clean
I'm the diamond chain choker, always remain sober
Don't drink liquor and all the games over
Need a plane, I explain it to my broker
Three bots in the hood top down, it ain't nova (My homie)

You know there's more man where that come from
Me and Kunta Love rollin' back to back in one

See the names have all changed since I been around
But the game ain't the same since I left out
Ohyou know we need ya, ohyou know we need ya
Right here's where we need ya, right here's where we need ya
Welcome back.
Welcome back, welcome back, Betha's back (You know you like that)
Welcome back, welcome back, Harlem's back (You know you like that)
You know you like that

Welcome back, welcome back, Betha's back (You know you like that)
You know you like that
Welcome back, welcome back, Harlem's back (You know you like that)

See I rep the most high, still I'm the most fly
I win so much, they wanna know who I'm coached by
Everyday approached by chicks when I was on top
Wanna give me sosa, but I'm like don't try
I see the hisses and the disses when I go by
But see the misses on my wristses when I float by
Self control, and I can't tell you no lie
Tryin' to find a soulmate, you end up being so tired
I make my money man without the coca
Livin' the vida without the loca
I'm down south so they show me country love
And I ain't even country thug

The people give me daps and hugs, so it must be love
And I love the country grub
It feel good to hear people singing welcome back
And I ain't even sellin' the track, cause I'm that Harlem cat

See the names have all changed since I been around
But the game ain't the same since I left out
Ohyou know we need ya, ohyou know we need ya
Right here's where we need ya, right here's where we need ya
Welcome back.
Welcome back, welcome back, Betha's back (You know you like that)
Welcome back, welcome back, Harlem's back (You know you like that)
You know you like that
Welcome back, welcome back, Betha's back (You know you like that)
You know you like that
Welcome back, welcome back, Harlem's back (You know you like that)
See the names have all changed since I been around
But the game ain't the same since I left out
Ohyou know we need ya, ohyou know we need ya
Right here's where we need ya, right here's where we need ya
Welcome back.
Welcome back, welcome back, Betha's back (You know you like that)
Welcome back, welcome back, Harlem's back (You know you like that)
You know you like that
Welcome back, welcome back, Betha's back (You know you like that)
You know you like that
Welcome back, welcome back, Harlem's back (You know you like that)
