Red Black Green, Red Gold Green
Dat's how we know we a fe we dream team 


The other day
A friend gave me a call
He said that the dream team was playin basketball
Was so excited
That I hadda get a Witness
The first time the NBA was in the 'lympics
Players from the east
players from the west 
And you can bet that they took the very best
("Except they left Tim Hardaway at home" 
"Yeah that was hella fucked up!") 
But Anyway
I tuned in because I was hella psyched
To see Magic Johnson on the same team as Mike

Gettin crazy
Havin lots of fun 
Makin sure that they got the job done 
Fans were wavin the red white end blue
It seemed strange to me
was it strange to you? 
Brotha's on the street
And everyone is scared a ya 
So how could ten Africans represent America?
Bullshit
It didn't mean a thing
'Cause in the same year
we saw Rodney King 
So I thought
That I would put a team together
A team that I have been waitin for forever 
Some a you
May know what I mean 
But if you don't then
Lemme introduce you to... 
MY DREAM TEAM! 
"SPEARHEAD IN THE AREA!"


THIS IS MY DREAM TEAM, MY DREAM TEAM 
MY DREAM TEAM, MY DREAM TEAM 

Well Chuck D'sannouncin'
Flava's doin' color
Halftime enterntainment by Dre and Ed Lover
Malcolm X is the coach he's drawin' up the strategy
He's choppin up America's anatomy
'cause they're the ones
we're up against of course 
Are general manager is Chief Crazy Horse 
Huey Newton
'cause he was extra hard
He's the one
who would be playin at the shootin' guard
I dreamed Charles Barkley would be 
Played by Marcus Garvey
He'd be throwin people off his back and makin 
Sure they never got a rebound rebound and
He'd throw it to the outlet
Nat Turner
'cause he can turn the corner when
He's out there
He be flyin through the air
throwin passes like
He really doesn't care
behind the back and in
Between the legs
He's handlin the rock
as gently as an egg
He's throwin it in
to Angela Davis's neighborhood 
She's postin up down in the extra hard wood
She grabs the pill
and then she puts her shoulder down
Get out the way
'cause she's gonna throw down now
Boom oh my god! I just can't believe it
Get anotha backboard or bettah yet leave it. 
We always play for fun
but we always play for keeps 
The game is over and the loser's gotta sweep.
Up the glass
that we busted in the ass 
Set the record straight
about America's past
THIS IS MY DREAM TEAM
"SPEARHEAD IN THE AREA!" 


DREAM TEAM'S IN THE HOUSE 
DREAM TEAM'S IN THE HOUSE 

Well after doin that
we be headin for the ceremony 
Hand on the heart
is a bunch of baloney
The spirit of
the '68 olympics
Black power people
can I get a witness
Fist in the air
this is proper manners
While Jimi Hendrix
is fuckin' up the spangled banner
Up into the sky
Miles Davis blows a horn 
Look into the bleachers
It's Bill Clinton sellin popcorn
So now we jump! and we have a celebration! 
Shaquille 0'neal would provide the entertainment
To some of you this is a far fetched scheme
But to me... I'll tell you what it is...
This is my Dream Team...
"spearhead in the area"



Yeah Sista Rosa Perks she gets the first seat
On the bench!
And Dr. King, webring him in in a pinch.

Because I like to shoot hoops not brothas!
Beceuse I like to shoot hoops not brothas!
Because I like to shoot hoops not brothas!
Because I like to shoot hoops not brothas!
