Uhh, Once upon a time, let's see if I remember
Back in January
Nah, chill..... It was December
True... Cuz that's when L started his bid
Partied through the New Year
January third he slid
Up until then, yo, L had it swell
Called him Sweet Pea like his name was Pernell
He did the job, money came with ease
Blowing outta town, moving bricks and ki's
Him and his chick, in forty-G rides
Holding down fort like they Bonnie N Clyde
Luxury cars of all makes and models
New outfits everyday, downin' champagne by the bottle
Glass in the air (air)
Toast to my team (team)
Toast to my cream and the scotties that beam
While others fiend, I'm abouts da beamer
Think about your girl, just say what (Say what!), I'm a dreamer
Called up cru
Yo, they probably in the studio
Phil Collins in the background
(Su-Su-Sudio)

Chorus: repeat 3X
Now this ain't funny, so don't you dare laugh
Just another case about the wrong path
(Where's my chick?) Sent her on a mission
Hope she ain't slip... On that pickup
Yo, who this on my flip
What! My cash and he fucked her wit dat A
Me and Mitch rollin' over there quick fast
Rolled up on the spot, (It's that kid Uzi Ed)
He took me for my paper so just call him Uzi Dead!
Used to run epps wit him back in the day
Mitch popped the trunk
Passed the German ak
You dirty rat! I'm bout to bless that ass
Better take cover from the rat-tat-tat-tat

Uzi Ed, ain't have a vest, three to the chest, Ed got blessed
L got life, Ed got death
Honey took the money and she slid to the left
Back in the day I told L she was shady
Now she in Cali about to have Ed's baby

Chorus: repeat 5
