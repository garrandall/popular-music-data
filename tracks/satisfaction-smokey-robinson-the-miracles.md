Satisfaction,
That means,
Different strokes for different folks,
Oh yeah.

Now to the man who who's scaled the mountain high,
Sky.

Oh, but having a baby with me, baby,
Is satisfaction enough for me.
Oh, and holding him tightly by me, mightily,
That's satisfaction enough for me.

Ohhh, satisfaction,
Oh yeah,
Life is so,
To each his own.

Well now your satisfaction now,
May be,
Anything from A to Z,
Your mind is free.
Uh huh.

Oh, but having a baby with me, baby,
Is satisfaction enough for me.
Oh, and holding him tightly by me, mightily,
That's satisfaction enough for me.

Oh and satisfaction,
Can't be classified,
Oh ho.
It all depends on,
What you feel inside.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

Ohhh, how can I satisfy,
All of my baby's dreams?
And keep her from seekin',
Some other means,
Of excitement,
And relaxation?

I want to be,
What she needs.
In every phase of life,
And every situation.

Oh, but having a baby with me, baby,
Is satisfaction enough for me.
Oh, and holding him tightly by me, mightily,
That's satisfaction enough for me.

Oh, but having a baby with me, baby,
Is satisfaction enough for me.
Oh, and holding him tightly by me, mightily,
That's satisfaction enough for me.
