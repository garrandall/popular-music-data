Oh, what a feelin', Lord
Somethin' fallin' down inside of me
She's real and, well, I know right where I
Oughta be alone with her tonight
Wanna see that things go right, so
Baby, don't you leave me
Baby, please don't leave me

Gotta get it this time
I've gotta get things right this time
I've gotta get it this time
Because it'll be the last time around

The people are calling me, Lord
Tryin' to find out what I'm doin' with my life
You see, I-I, all I need is the good lovin' of a woman just like you
I'm hoping that you'll see things through, so
Baby, don't you leave me
Baby, please don't leave me

I've gotta get you this time
I've gotta get things right this time
I've gotta get it this time
Because it'll be the last time around

I've gotta get it this time
I've gotta get things right this time
I've gotta get it this time
Because it'll be the last time 'round

Gotta get it this time
I've gotta get things right this time
I've gotta get it this time
Because it'll be the last time 'round...
