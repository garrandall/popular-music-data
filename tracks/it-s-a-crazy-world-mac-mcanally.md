Younger men don't seem to need a purpose
They just stand and fight for anybody's cause
And older men see livin' as a circus
The ones who stand up for the longest need applause
From the young ones who proclaim to have the answers
To the questions no one ever asked before
And they cheer and have parades but when it's over
They don't claim to know the answers anymore

And it's a crazy world, but I live here
And if you can hear me singin' so do you
And I'm turnin' out my night light feelin' satisfied
That there's nothin' any one of us can do
No, there's nothin' anyone of us can do

Babies cry all day sometimes for nothin'
And I have cried all day for not much more
Well it ain't easy when you hate the things you're lovin'
And you wonder what or maybe who you're lovin' for
And girls seem to think that they're the chosen ones
And women choose to let well enough alone
And it's their business till you stick your nose in ones
And then you got yourself some problems of your own
