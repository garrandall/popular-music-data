Jack, wanting someone to feel
Sat up on the hill and
Waited all day for Jill

Jill, always away from home
Never bothering to phone
Always leaving poor Jack alone

Now why do you think
Jack snuck down the hill
He snuck down the hill
'Cause he needed love
Love he couldn't get from Jill
Oh, yes he did

Why do you think
Jack snuck down the hill
He snuck down the hill
He needed love
Oh, yes, he did
Love he couldn't get from Jill

Jack like Little Red Riding Hood
Always trying to do good
Waited as long as he could

Jill, is it right or wrong
For Jack to carry on
If you leave him home too long

Now why do you think
Jack snuck down the hill
He snuck down, he snuck down
Broke his crown

He needed love
(Sweet love)
Love he couldn't get from Jill
Oh, sweet, sweet love

Why do you think
Jack snuck down the hill
(He snuck down the hill)
He needed love
(Oh, yes, he did)
Love he couldn't get
From Jill, oh yeah

(Jack) (Jill)
(Jack) (Jill)

Now why do you think
Why do you think
Jack snuck down the hill
Why do you think
He snuck down the hill

Cause he needed love
He needed love
Love he couldn't get from Jill
Yes, he did

Why do you think
He got down on his knees
Jack snuck down the hill
He had mud on his hands

He needed love
And he crawled and
He crawled and he crawled
Love he couldn't get from Jill

Why do you think
Jack snuck down the hill
He snuck down, he snuck
Down from his ground

He needed love
He needed love
Love he couldn't get from Jill
He wanted sweet, sweet love

Why do you think
Jack snuck down the hill...
