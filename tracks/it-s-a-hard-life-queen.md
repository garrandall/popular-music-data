I don't want my freedom
There's no reason for living with a broken heart


This is a tricky situation
I've only got myself to blame
It's just a simple fact of life
It can happen to anyone


You win, you lose
It's a chance you have to take with love
Oh yeah, I fell in love
But now you say it's over and I'm falling apart
Yeah, yeah


It's a hard life
To be true lovers together
To love and live forever in each other's hearts
It's a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another right from the start
When you're in love


I try and mend the broken pieces
I try to fight back the tears
They say it's just a state of mind
But it happens to everyone


How it hurts (Yeah) deep inside (Oh yeah)
When your love has cut you down to size
Life is tough - on your own
Now I'm waiting for something to fall from the skies
I'm waiting for love


It's a hard life
True lovers together
To love and live forever in each other's hearts
It's a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another right from the start
When you're in love

It's a hard life
In a world that's filled with sorrow
There are people searching for love in every way
It's a long hard fight
But I'll always live for tomorrow
I'll look back on myself and say I did it for love


Yes, I did it for love
For love
Oh, oh, oh I did it for love
