Golden Tee, shuffleboard, pinball, he's got the score
that everybody around here's tryin to beat,
he's a six pack up when he walks in,
tells the band crank it up to 10,
then he's up dancin on his seat,
well he's a big mouth, yellin' hey play some free bird,
says give me three steps and nobody gets hurt,
then he takes off his shirt


There's one in every crowd,
brings the party in us out,
good time charley with a harley, whiskey bent and hellbound,
he's got the next round, but he always drinks for free,
there's one in every crowd, and it's usually me,
hey ya'll, hey ya'll, hey ya'll, there's one in every crowd

Got a fliptop box of marlboros,
he'll bum a light and steal your girl,
then laugh at you for gettin' all upset, well everybody here knows his name,
makes everybody else look sane,
when he's out, as far as you can get,
in his mind he's a rock star, crankin' out that air guitar,
til the bartender says fool, get off my bar


There's one in every crowd,
that brings the party in us out,
good time charley with a harley, whiskey bent and hellbound,
he's got the next round, but he always drinks for free,
there's one in every crowd, and it's usually me,
hey ya'll, hey ya'll, hey ya'll, there's one in every crowd

He's a hard drinkin man's man,
and women love him when they can,
he's a bartender's best friend,
it ain't a party till he walks in


There's one in every crowd,
that brings the party in us out,
good time charley with a harley, whiskey bent and hellbound,
he's got the next round, but he always drinks for free,
there's one in every crowd, and it's usually me,
hey ya'll, hey ya'll, hey ya'll, there's one in every crowd

It's usually me, hey ya'll, hey ya'll, hey ya'll, there's one in every crowd, that's right
