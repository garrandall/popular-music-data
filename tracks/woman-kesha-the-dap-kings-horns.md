Let's be serious, it's a real
This is, excuse me?
Ok, shut up

I buy my own things, I pay my own bills
These diamond rings, my automobiles
Everything I got, I bought it
Boys can't buy my love, buy my love, yeah

I do what I want (he does)
Say what you say
I work real hard every day

I'm a motherfucking woman, baby, alright
I don't need a man to be holding me too tight
I'm a motherfucking woman, baby, that's right
I'm just having fun with my ladies here tonight
I'm a motherfucker

Mmm, yeah

Driving around town in my Cadillac
Girls in the front, boys in the back
Loosey as a goosey and we're looking for some fun

I'm a motherfucking woman, baby, alright
I don't need a man to be holding me too tight
I'm a motherfucking woman, baby, that's right
I'm just having fun with my ladies here tonight
I'm a motherfucker

Mmm, yeah

Mmm, yeah

Don't buy me a drink, I make my money
Don't touch my weave, don't call me "honey"
'Cause I run my shit, baby ('Cause I run my shit, baby)
(I run my shit)

Don't buy me a drink, I make my money
Don't touch my weave, don't call me "honey"
('Cause I write this shit, baby)
I write my shit (I write this shit)

Don't buy me a drink, I make my money
Don't touch my weave, don't call me "honey"
('Cause I run my shit, baby, I run my shit)

Don't buy me a drink, I make my money
Don't touch my weave, don't call me "honey" (Don't touch my weave, baby)
'Cause I run my shit, baby, I run my shit

Don't buy me a drink, I make my money
Don't touch my weave, don't call me "honey"
I run this shit, baby, I run this shit

Don't buy me a drink, I make my money
Don't touch my weave, don't call me "honey"
('Cause I write this shit, baby, I write this shit)

I'm a motherfucking woman, baby, alright
I don't need a man to be holding me too tight
I'm a motherfucking woman, baby, that's right
I'm just having fun with my ladies here tonight
I'm a motherfucker

Mmm, yeah
