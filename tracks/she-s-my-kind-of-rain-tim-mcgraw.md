She's my kind of rain
Like love in a drunken sky
She's confetti falling
Down all night


She sits quietly there
Black water in a jar
Says, Baby why are you
Trembling like you are


So I wait
And I try
I confess like a child


She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling
Down all night
She's my kind of rain


She's the sun set shadows
She's like Rembrandt's light
She's the history that's made at night
She's my lost companion
She's my dreaming tree
Together in this brief eternity
Summer days, winter snows
She's all things to behold


She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling
Down all night
She's my kind of rain


So I wait
And I try
I confess all my crimes


She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling
Down all night
She's my kind of rain
She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling
Down all night
She's my kind of rain


She's my kind of rain
Oh, rain on me
She's my kind of rain
