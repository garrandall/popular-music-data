You smoked me like a cigarette
I was burned I was cast aside
Now you knew what you couldn't get
So you settled for my pride
But it's all right
It's cool baby tonight
When push comes to shove
Oh baby you gave me enough
And i'll pay when the price is right
But you can't put a price on love

Now you can fly like you'll never fall
What you touch maybe turn to gold
And you can talk 'til you've said it all
It's just the greatest story ever told
Right down the line
Oh baby it's fine
When push comes to shove
Oh baby you gave me enough
And i'll pay when the price is right
But you can't put a price on love

Now you can give what you wanna give
I won't consider that you might be lying
You live a life that you wanna live
But it's deeper when it's love you're buying
I'll pay when the price is right
But you can't put a price on love
Make up your mind
Oh maybe it's time
When push comes to shove
Oh baby you gave me enough
And i'll pay when the price is right
But you can't put a price on love
Yes I will pray for another night
But you can't put a price on love
