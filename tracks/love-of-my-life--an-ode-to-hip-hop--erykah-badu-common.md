Right here what we gone do is go back
Way
Way back, yea
Way back
Oh...
Way back, yeah


I met him when I was a
A little girl, he gave me
He gave me poetry
He was my first
But in my heart I knew I
Wasn't the only one
'Cause when the tables turned
He had to break, but...


Whenever I got lonely
Or needed some advice
He gave me his shoulder
His words were very nice
But that is all behind me
'Cause now there is no other
My love is his and his is mine
A friend became the...


Love of my life
You are my friend
Love of my life
I can depend
Love of my life
Without you, baby
It feels like I sampled true love
But the shit didn’t clear


A freak-freak, y'all, and ya don't stop
A to the beat y'all and ya don't stop
A freak-freak


Or could it be that it was
All just so simple then
A teenage love but you said
He's just a friend
He moved around and we kept
In touch through his friend Mike
The world was young and we knew
We couldn't rush but...


Whenever I got lonely
Or needed some advice
He gave me his shoulder
His words were very nice
But that is all behind me
'Cause now there is no other
My love is his and his is mine
A friend became the...


Love of my life
You are my friend
Love of my life
On you I can depend, yeah, yeah
Love of my life
Without you, baby
It feels like I sampled true love
But the shit didn’t clear


Y'all know how I met her
We broke up and got back together
To get her back, I had to sweat her
Thought she'd roll with bad boys forever in many ways
Them boys may be better, to grow, I had to let her
She needed cheddar and I understood that
Looking for cheese, that don't make her a hoodrat
In fact she's a queen to me, her light beams on me
I love it when she sings to me
It's like that and a...


Love of my life
Oh, you know you rock my world and
Love of my life
You B-boy and I'm B-girl'n
Love of my life
It don't stop until the break of dawn, oh..

Love of my life
Oh, you know you rock my world and
Love of my life
You B-boy and I'm B-girl'n
Love of my life
Yeah...
