Get a load of me, get a load of you
Walking down the street and I hardly know you
It's just like we were meant to be
Holding hands with you when we're out at night
Got a girlfriend, you say it isn't right
And I've got someone waiting too


What if this is just the beginning?
We're already wet and we're gonna go swimming


Why can't I breathe
Whenever I think about you?
Why can't I speak
Whenever I talk about you?
It's inevitable
It's a fact that we're gonna get down to it
So tell me
Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?
Whenever I think about you...


Isn't this the best part of breaking up?
Finding someone else you can't get enough of
Someone who wants to be with you too
It's an itch we know we are gonna scratch
Gonna take a while for this egg to hatch
But wouldn't it be beautiful


Here we go
We're at the beginning, we haven't fucked yet
But my head's spinning


Why can't I breathe
Whenever I think about you?
Why can't I speak
Whenever I talk about you?
It's inevitable
It's a fact that we're gonna get down to it
So tell me
Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?


High enough for you to make me wonder
Where it's going
High enough for you to pull me under
Somethin's growing
Out of this that we can control
Baby, I am dyin'


Why can't I breathe
Whenever I think about you?
Why can't I speak
Whenever I talk about you?
Why can't I breathe
Whenever I think about you?
Why can't I speak
Whenever I talk about you?
It's inevitable
It's a fact that we're gonna get down to it
So tell me
Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?


Whenever I think about you
Whenever I think about you
Whenever I think about you
Whenever I think about you
