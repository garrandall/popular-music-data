Lit a candle and I set it on the wall
And let the wax like teardrops fall
And then I wonder why I used to dream on, baby
Dream that we could have it all

I see now love for you
Was what you had to do
You change your mind like you change your dress

I thought I knew you every way
I saw the child, the woman as plain as day
I thought I knew myself but now I come to find
Love is blind and I'm the loving kind

Bought a diamond and I set it on your hand
Introduced you to the band
And now I hear them say you've been a bad girl, baby
You don't seem to understand

Just for the social whirl
You play the party girl
Now you drink your wine, baby, time to forget

I thought I knew you every way
I saw the child, the woman as plain as day
I thought I knew myself but now I come to find
Love is blind and I'm the loving kind

You made a game of love
What were you thinking of?
It takes a heartbeat, baby, to say goodbye

I thought I knew you every way
I saw the child, the woman as plain as day
I thought I knew myself but now I come to find
Love is blind and I'm the loving kind

I thought I knew you every way
I saw the child, the woman as plain as day
I thought I knew myself but now I come to find
Love is blind and I'm the loving kind
