She said she wanna stay together
I don't think I can, oh


Red light, you know I can't make this thing that official
Believe we had a great night but I ain't the type to tell you that I miss you, shit
You don't like that I make this easy, leaving after sexing on the floor
Baby, I know you need me like I need you, but I'm not the one you wanna love


So just pop a couple bands with a nigga like me
Loving ain't the same with a nigga like
You used to them but ain't no loving me
I hear what you would say and girl, it's clear to see
You should just drink a couple drinks with a nigga like me
You probably go insane with a nigga like me
Let's just party 'til we can't, ain't no loving me
And I'm the one to blame, ain't no loving me
So don't come looking for love
Oh, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love
Don't come looking for love
Oh, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love


Shawty if you looking for somebody trying to settle down
Probably won't be around, nah baby
You should hit me when you tired
Of playing up in the house and ain't nobody around, you need that
When you need that late night
We can both make love to the daylight, you got it girl, you got it girl
But you know I can't stay right? Uh, nah babe
All I want is you so what you tryna do?


So just pop a couple bands with a nigga like me
Loving ain't the same with a nigga like
You used to them but ain't no loving me
I hear what you would say and girl, it's clear to see
You should just drink a couple drinks with a nigga like me
You probably go insane with a nigga like me
Let's just party 'til we can't, ain't no loving me
And I'm the one to blame, ain't no loving me
So don't come looking for love
Oh, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love
Don't come looking for love
Oh, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love


No love, no love, no love, no love, no love
No love, no love, no love, no love, no love
No love, no love, no love, no love, no love
No love, no love, no love, no love, no love
Until the morning we can freak, but baby girl, you gotta know
We can rumble in these sheets but after this you gotta go
Don't take it personal, when it feel so good, we tend to get emotional
But that is when you find out that it hurts the most, since then I've always been like, trust nobody show no love


Pop a couple bands with a nigga like me
Loving ain't the same with a nigga like
You used to them but ain't no loving me
I hear what you would say and girl, it's clear to see
You should just drink a couple drinks with a nigga like me
You probably go insane with a nigga like me
Let's just party 'til we can't, ain't no loving me
And I'm the one to blame, ain't no loving me
So don't come looking for love
Oh, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love
Don't come looking for love
Oh, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love
