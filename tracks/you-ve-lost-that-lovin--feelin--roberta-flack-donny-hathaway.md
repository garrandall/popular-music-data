You never close your eyes any more when I kiss your lips
And there's no tenderness like before in your fingertips
Mmm, you're tryin' hard not to show it, baby
But baby, baby I know it

You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Oh that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Now its gone, gone, gone whoaohoh

Now there's no welcome look in your eyes when I reach for you
Baby you've started to criticize every every every little thing that I do
It makes me just feel like crying, baby
'Cause baby, something beautiful's dyin'

You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Oh that lovin'feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Now its gone, gone, gone, whoaohoh
Baby baby, I'd get down on my knees for you
If you would only love me, love me like you used to do
You know that
We had a love, a love, a love you don't find every day
No no, no no, no no no no no no no
So don't, don't, don't, don't, baby don't throw it away
Na na, don't throw it away, don't throw it away
Now baby, oh baby, I beg you baby, oh baby
I beg you please, I need your love
So bring it on back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it, bring it, bring it back

Bring back that lovin' feelin', o-o-oh that lovin' feelin'
Bring back that lovin' feelin'
'Cause its gone, gone, gone
And I can't go on no more

Oh baby, yeah baby
Oh bring it on back now, hey baby
I beg you baby, oh baby
Bring it on back, bring it on back
Bring it, bring it, bring it back

Bring back that lovin' feelin'
Oh that lovin' feelin'
