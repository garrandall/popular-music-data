I'd like to give you a test,
So darlin' prepare yourself,
When I say Love please explain,
What picture pop in your brain,
'Cause when you talk about love (love, love, love),
When you think about love (love, love, love),
When you talk about love (love, love, love),
You should be talkin' 'bout me.
Now if you need to be taught,
Don't make me an after thought,
For every lesson that's wrong,
You can bet my good lovin' will be gone,
So let's erase any doubt,
Take a few seconds to figure out,
Speak from your lips to my ears,
Yes, I know you know what I wanna hear,
'Cause when you talk love (love, love, love),
When you think about love (love, love, love),
When you talk about love (love, love, love),
You should be talkin' 'bout me.
No I'm not gonna play tit for tat,
When it comes to affairs of the heart,
But if I love you I want you back,
And I know that I love you so just do your part.
