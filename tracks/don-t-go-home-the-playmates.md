Don't go home, my little darlin'
Please don't leave the party yet
Don't go home, my little darlin'
Now that we have finally met

Can't you see I came to the party
'cause I knew that you'd be here?
Dance with me and stay at the party
So that I can hold you near

Don't go home, my little darlin'
'cause I'm so in love with you
Don't go home, my little darlin'
Till you learn to love me too

Don't go home, my little darlin'
Please don't leave the party yet
Don't go home, my little darlin'
Now that we have finally met

I have waited up for the party
'cause I knew we'd finally meet
When I saw you here at the party
Then it made my world complete

Don't go home, my little darlin'
Please don't leave me up a tree
Don't go home, my little darlin'
Don't go home, please stay with me

Don't go home, my little darlin'
Please don't leave the party yet
Don't go home, my little darlin'
Now that we have finally met

Can't you see I came to the party
'cause I knew that you'd be here?
Dance with me and stay at the party
So that I can hold you near

Don't go home, my little darlin'
'cause I'm so in love with you
Don't go home, my little darlin'
Till you learn to love me too

Don't go home, my little darlin'
Fade
Don't go home, my little darlin'
Don't go home, my little darlin'
