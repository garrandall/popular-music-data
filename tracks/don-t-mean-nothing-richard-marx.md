Welcome to the big time, you're bound to be a star
Even if you don't go all the way, I know that you'll go far
This race is for rats, it can turn you upside down
Ain't no one you can count on in this sleazy little town, oh no

Lots of promises in the dark
Don't you open your heart

'Cause it don't mean nothing
The words that they say
No, it don't mean nothing
These games that people play
No, it don't mean nothing
No victim, no crime
No, it don't mean nothing
Till you sign it on the dotted line
Whoa yeah

The director smiles as you walk in the door
He says, "I love your work, babe, but you're just not what we're looking for"
It's never what, but who it is you know
So easy to get stuck in all that California snow, oh no

Take a good look around and you'll find
People trying to mess with your mind

But it don't mean nothing
The words that they say
No, it don't mean nothing
These games that people play
No, it don't mean nothing
No victim, no crime
No, it don't mean nothing
Till you sign it on the dotted line

Hollywood can be so lonely
Make you the winner of a losing fight
Party is never over
The stars are always shining, doesn't matter if it's day or night

The producer says, "let me change a line or two"
And a little bit of something can look awfully good to you
And you wanna scream, but you gotta keep it all inside
When you're trying to make a living, there ain't no such thing as pride, oh no

Lots of promises in the dark
Don't you open your heart

'Cause it don't mean nothing
The words that they say
No, it don't mean nothing
These games that people play
No, it don't mean nothing
No victim, no crime
No, it don't mean nothing
Till you sign it on the dotted line

(Don't mean nothing) Don't mean nothing
(Don't mean nothing) Oh, no, it don't mean nothing
(Don't mean nothing) Oh, no, it don't mean nothing
(Don't mean nothing) (Don't mean nothing at all)

(Don't mean nothing)
(Don't mean nothing)
(Don't mean nothing)
(Don't mean nothing)
