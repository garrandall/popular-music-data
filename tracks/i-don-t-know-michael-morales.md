You don't know, what you've done to me, in the name of love
Do I dare, make a mess of things, have I had enough?

The words are saying I love you, but I've seen the truth turned to lies
I'm not so sure I want you, Do you wonder why?
I don't know who to love anymore
When my heart broke and closed up the door
And the love that's the key now is so far from me
If I found it I wouldn't know what it's for
I'm not sure of my left from my right
I just hope that you come back some night
So I'll have you again
Cause I know until then
I don't know who to love anymore

You don't know, what you mean to me, on a cold, dark night
Do you think, things unseen to me, do you hold me high?

The words are saying I love you, but I've seen the truth turned to lies
I'm not so sure I want you, Do you wonder why?
I don't know who to love anymore
When my heart broke and closed up the door
And the love that's the key now is so far from me
If I found it I wouldn't know what it's for
I'm not sure of my left from my right
I just hope that you come back some night
So I'll have you again
Cause I know until then
I won't know who to love anymore

And just when it's over, my heart was healing for good
Some night you come over, and I'm wondering, waiting, If maybe I should

I don't know who to love anymore
When my heart broke and closed up the door
And the love is the key now is so far from me
If I found it I wouldn't know what it's for
I'm not sure of my left from my right
I just hope that you come back some night
So I'll have you again
Cause I know until then
I don't know who to love anymore
