It seems like weeks since you looked at me, baby, without that look of distaste 
I don't know why your feelings are changing but I've seen it in your face 
And all those times when our lips were kissing, our tongues were telling lies 
And all those signs I've been missing right there in your eyes

So come on babe, let's kiss this thing goodbye

I sometimes feel when we're together baby, everything has turned out wrong 
And I know you feel exactly the same way but still we carry on 
I've been waiting up by the window watching these cars go by 
And I tell myself that I'll go through the motions for the last time tonight

So come on babe, let's kiss this thing goodbye

Now I'm watching the fumes foul up the sunrise, I'm watching the light fade away 
And I'm hoping tonight that I'll open the door, and you'll stand here and say 

Come on babe, let's kiss this thing goodbye 
Better make it sooner than later 
Before it all turns sour 
Don't you know we'd better kiss this thing goodbye
