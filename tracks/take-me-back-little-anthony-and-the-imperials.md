You don't remember me
But I remember you
Twas' not so long ago
You broke my heart in two

Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
Caused by you...

If we could start a new
I wouldn't hesitate
I'd gladly take you back
And tempt the hand of fate

Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
Caused by you...

Love is not a gadget
Love is not a toy
When you find the one you love
She'll fill your heart with joy

If we could start a new
I wouldn't hesitate
I'd gladly take you back
And tempt the hand of fate

Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
Caused by you...
