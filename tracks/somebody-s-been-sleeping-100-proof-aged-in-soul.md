Fe Fi Fo Fum
I can feel the presence of someone
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed
Somebody's been sitting in my chair
They ate up all my food
And I don't stand to search
Don't ell me it was a woman
'Cause a woman don't eat that much
My brand new silk pajama's
They're rolled up in the chair
My mind ain't playing tricks on me
Now tell me is he still here
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed
Somebody's been sitting in my chair
Cigarettes in my ashtray
And I don't even smoke
Somebody's been in my best booze
I can tell cause the seal is broke
I left my bedroom slippers
Last night underneath of my bed
And now they're in my living room
And my bed was left unmade
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed
Somebody's been sitting in my chair
Fe Fi Fo Fum
I can feel the presence of someone
Fe Fi Fo Fum
I can feel the presence of someone
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed
Somebody's been eating my food
Somebody's been looking at my shoes
Somebody's been sitting in my chair
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed
