I don't mind
When you act your age
It suits me fine
That you treat me like a child

And I can't deny
When I'm with you
That you step outside
Of all those fears locked up inside

Your love is driving me crazy
Your love just takes me away
Your love is driving me crazy
It takes me all the way

What I like
Is what you've got to offer
Just my type
Don't mind playing on the edge

Your love is driving me crazy
Your love just takes me away
Your love is driving me crazy
It takes me all the way, yeah

Lead me to forbidden doors
You know I'm yours
Yeah, you got it, yeah, I want it
Don't you know it baby?

Right on time
A tight fit right on the money
So sublime
Hot, sweet cherries on the vine

Your love is driving me crazy
Your love just takes me away
Your love is driving me crazy
It takes me all the way, yeah

Your love is driving me crazy
Your love just takes me away
Your love is driving me crazy
Your love just takes me away, oh yeah

Your love, your love
Your love just takes me away, oh yeah
Your love
