Little Suzi's on the up, looking for a get-away
Ruby tries to bring her down, she's lookin' for another way
Little Suzi's on the up, headin' for the spotlights
Ruby finally gets up, lookin' for some quiet night


And the music makes her feel so hot
Oh and she'll smile for the camera with all she's got
Don't bring her down, she's a lot like you
She'll be richer by far if her dreams come true

Little Suzi's on the up

Little Suzi's on the up, now suddenly it's not a game
Ruby's got to give up, 'cos Suzi's plainly set on pain
Little Suzi's on the up, cost in cost, your point is made
Ruby's gonna hang around, to make sure Suzi's okay



Don't bring her down, she's a lot like you
She'll be richer by far if her dreams come true

Little Suzi's on the up





Don't you bring her down, she's a lot like you
She'll be richer by far when her dreams come true

Little Suzi's on the up, oh yes she is, ow!
Now she's on the up, little Suzi's on the up
Heading for the spotlight, oh little Suzi
Oh and the music makes her feel so hot, go little Suzi, yeah
Ohh, yeah yeah, oh yeah
