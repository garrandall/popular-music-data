If you want something to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
'Cause baby, baby my time is much too expensive
I don't want no little boy

But you, you are serious
Don't go play with my heart, makes me furious
And if you want me to love you
Oh baby I will, oh yeah I will

Tell it like it is
Oh yeah, just let your conscience be your guide
You know deep down inside, I believe you love me
Just forget your foolish pride

I think life's too short for all this sorrow
We might be here today, gone tomorrow
I might as well just get what I want
I wanna live, I wanna live

Tell it like it is
Don't be ashamed now let your conscious be your guide
Oh yeah, and deep down inside I belive you love me
Just forget your foolish pride

Tell it like it is
Aw yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah let your conscious be your guide
Aw, Aw, tell it like it is
Baby, baby I believe you love me,
Just forget your foolish pride.
Tell it like it is

Tell it to me baby, tell it to me
You gotta tell me right now
Tell it like it is
