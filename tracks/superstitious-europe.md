Keep on walkin' that road and I'll follow
Keep on callin' my name I'll be there
And if a mirror should break it's easy to take
Cause deep down I know that you care
I'm not superstitious

I'm not superstitious, I have no doubt
That there's a reason, how things turn out
While things are changin' from day to day
I'll keep this feelin' with me all the way

And I want you to know
That you're on my mind
Every day, all of the time

So keep on walkin' that road and I'll follow
Keep on callin' my name I'll be there
And if a mirror should break it's easy to take
Cause deep down I know that you care
I'm not superstitious

There might be times of wonder
When I'm on my own
Tryin' to find out if love has gone
It might make a difference
It might bring me down
But no superstition is gonna turn things around

And I want you to know
That you're on my mind
Every day, all of the time

So keep on walkin' that road and I'll follow
Keep on callin' my name I'll be there
And if a mirror should break it's easy to take
Cause deep down I know that you care
I'm not superstitious

So keep on walkin' and we'll make things right
Yeah, keep on dreamin' each and every night
We're gonna make it, that's what we'll do
Right to the end girl, we're gonna walk on through

So keep on walkin' that road and I'll follow
Keep on callin' my name I'll be there
And if a mirror should break it's easy to take
Cause deep down I know that you care
I'm not superstitious
