All of the ladies attending the ball
Are requested to gaze in the faces
Found on the dance cards

Please then remember
And don't get too close to one special one
He will take your defenses and run

So we change partners
Time to change partners
You must change partners
Again

This is how most of our ladies grew up
At the country club dances
They learned how to handle the boys

Gently but firmly they learned to say no
There were four more young men
Who were waiting in the color and the noise

So we change partners
Time to change partners
You must change partners
Again

All of the ladies attending the ball
Are requested to gaze in the faces
Found on the dance cards

Please then remember and follow your list
'Cause the dear things get hurt
And the broken hearts make you feel hard

So we change partners
Time to change partners
You must change partners
Again
