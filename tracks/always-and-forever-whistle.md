And every day
Love me your own special way
Melt all my heart away
With a smile

Take time to tell me
You really care
And feel sad tomorrow together
I'll always love you
Forever, forever

Always and forever
Each moment with you
Is just like a dream to me
That somehow came true

And I know tomorrow
Will still be the same
Cause we`ve got a life of love
That won`t ever change

And every day
Love me your own special way
Melt all my heart away
With a smile

Take time to tell me
You really care
And feel sad tomorrow together
I'll always love you
Forever, forever

There'll always be sunshine
When I look at you
Something I can't explain
Just the things that you do

And if you get lonely
Phone me
And take a second to give to me
The magic you make

And every day
Love me your own special way
Melt all my heart away
With a smile

Take time to tell me
You really care
And feel sad tomorrow together
I'll always love you
Forever, forever
