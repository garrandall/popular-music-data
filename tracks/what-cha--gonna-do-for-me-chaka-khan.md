All night and day
Just chippin' away
It's all in a day's work
Tryin' hard to defend
The time that I spend alone

The crown that you lose
Exploiting the blues
Won't get the job done
As hard as it bites
I'm keepin' my sights on you


What cha' gonna do for me
What cha' gonna do for me
What cha' gonna do for me
When the chips are down

In the cool of the night
When nothing seems right
The feeling can take you
Strange as it seems
You make your own dreams come true

If you try to conceal
The way that you feel
You're asking for trouble
Just as sure as I cry
I'm keeping my eye on you



You don't have to tell me
I'm to blame for this
'Cause what you hold against me
Is what I miss
