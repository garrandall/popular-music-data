Open up your mind and let me step inside
Rest your weary head and let your heart decide


It's so easy when you know the rules
It's so easy, all you have to do is fall in love
Play the game
Everybody play the game of love
Yeah


When you're feeling down and your resistance is low
Light another cigarette and let yourself go


This is your life, don't play hard to get
It's a free world, all you have to do is fall in love
Play the game
Everybody play the game of love
Ooh yeah


My game of love has just begun
Love runs from my head down to my toes
My love is pumping through my veins (play the game)
Driving me insane (come, come, come, come)
Come play the game, play the game, play the game
Play the game




Play the game
Everybody play the game of love
This is your life, don't play hard to get
It's a free world (free world), all you have to do is fall in love


Play the game, yeah
Everybody play the game of love
Your life, don't play hard to get
It's a free world (free world), all you have to do is fall in love
Play the game
Everybody play the game of love
