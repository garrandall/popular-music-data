B-boy where the fuck you at
I been looking for you're ass since a quarter past
Hot peas and butter, baby come and get your supper
Before I make you suffer, that's when you had enough-a
Can I get hot when you hit the jackpot
Surely I can if you the man
I get loose and produce large amounts of juice
Can you get used to that or do you need a boost of energy
To enter me and get it on
You're getting warm
I can feel you getting closer
Now baby, down this Mimosa
You better believe it's time to give a toast to
The woman of the decade, too bad to be played
Get vexed and I'm bound to throw shade
All over your body
Who's body, your body
I can rock a party like nobody
Leaving time to take home the loot
Choosy about who I let knock my boots
Now let me take sight while your loving the Lyte
Life ain't all that unless you're doing it right


Keep on, keeping on cause you came and you changed my world
Your love so brand new, keep on keep keeping on
Doin it right, right, right


Beware of the stare when I step into peace
I come in peace but I got shit that need to be released
Now who from the chosen shall I choose
Yeah now you wish you was in his shoes
I found me a new nigga this year
That knows how to handle this here
Now I look forward to going home at night
Brother does me right under the candlelight
Wax upon my back can I handle all of that
I guess I can, can I why not
If I wanna guess I can, can I
More honey than a bumble-bee hive
Pulling sixty-nine ways in my archive
Sweet like licorice, sugar for my booga
Juicy like Hi-C or an Icee
I got shit to make your ass write a bad check
Cause like I said I ain't afraid of the sweat
Beat on my drum if you feel the need to
As I procede to open up and feed you
I got a longing to put you where you wanna be
Been I can, I get rid of all company



Many have tried strict regulations
Lazy motherfuckers get put on probation
Those that didn't perform well
They gets no answer when they ring-a-ring-a my bell
You're playing with my time
Trying to jerk me, hurt me then dessert me
You better work me while you got the oppurtunity
To be in the midst of the L-Y-T-E
Only the strong survive, only the wise excel
Once said by my born-in-hell
Only the lonely die slowly
Left all alone try to control me
Easy does it never ask how was it
Never speak my info why my sheets in the streets
Cause that ain't cool and that ain't cute
To talk about who knocked the boots on a video shoot
But it's all good though, you gotta get it when you want it
Sight your prey, make your move and hop up on it
It's natural, never be ashamed
Fuck the fame, get the name and kick the game
