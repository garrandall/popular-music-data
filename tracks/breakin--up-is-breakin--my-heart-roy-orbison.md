I wonder why you threw your diary away 
When you walk by I nearly died What can I say
Things were fine, you were mine just yesterday  
Now we're apart, Breakin' up is breakin' my heart

I find myself alone at night And then I cry
No tenderness My happiness just said goodbye
Now you're gone, I'm alone I wonder why we had to part

Breakin' up is breakin' my heart, baby
Breakin' up is breakin' my heart

The love affair we used to share Is cold and still 
I loved you then I love you now I always will
The day that you found someone new
My lonely world just fell apart
Out of your arms drives me out of my mind

Baby, breaking up is breakin' my heart
Baby, breaking up is breakin' my heart
Breakin' up is breakin' my heart
Breakin' up is breakin' my heart
