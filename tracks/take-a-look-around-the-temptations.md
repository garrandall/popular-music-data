Feather in your cap if you catch a robber
Dirt in your face if your scheme falls through
Pay close attention to my story
You'll find every word is true


Junk man standing on the corner
Selling death, no conscience has he
In the name of God, won't somebody stop him
(Stop him, think about the children)
Its a matter of life and death, you see


Ain't no time to stand back and point your finger
We've got to face reality
No, no, no, no, no
Don't turn your back on this problem, people
Too much depends on you and me


Desperate with no sense of values
Just an evil mind lurking through the night
Because of you, the streets ain't safe no more for walking
'Cause you're feeling so up-tight
Take a look around
Don't be afraid
Take a look around
It's a younger generation now
Take a look around
Don't be afraid
Take a look around
It's up to you and me
Take a look around
It's a younger generation now
