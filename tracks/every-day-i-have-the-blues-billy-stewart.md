Every day
Every day I have the blues
Every day
Every day I have the blues;
Well, you see me worry, baby
Because it's you I hate to lose
Nobody loves me
Nobody seems to care
Nobody loves me
Nobody seems to care;
Speakin' of bad luck and trouble
Well, you know I've had my share
I'm gonna pack my suitcase
Movin' on down the line
Oh, I'm gonna pack my suitcase
Move on down the line;
Well there ain't nobody worryin'
And there ain't nobody cryin'
Seems to me every day, every day
Every day I have the blues
Every day, every day, every day
Every day I have the blues
You see me worry, baby
Cause it's you I hate to lose
Nobody loves me
Nobody seems to care;
Nobody loves me
Nobody seems to care;
Speakin' of bad luck and trouble
Well, you know I've had my share
Every day
Every day I have the blues
Every day
Every day I have the blues;
Well, you see me worry, baby
Because it's you I hate to lose
