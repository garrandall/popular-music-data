I could spend my whole life writing love songs
If they'd help bring me closer to you
Trying to find the right words
But they all get so blurred
While expressing my feelings, I get so confused

And I can analyze and you can analyze
We can both analyze till we're blue
Let emotions take reign
Let them play their own games
Let the freedom of youth captivate you

Let the song last forever, let the song last a day
Let our love last a lifetime, let our love fade away
No matter what happens if we go our own ways
We'll be both walking wiser if walking away

Now, I know you've been hurt, you've been broken
Life just ain't real without pain
And there's no guarantee 
That all ends happily
When you fall you gotta rise up swinging again

And you can run away, I can run away
We can both run till our lives are through
Some people hide till they're hollow inside
Please don't allow that to happen to you

Let the song last forever, let the song last a day
Let our love last a lifetime, let our love fade away
No matter what happens if we go our own ways
We'll be both walking wiser if walking away

I'm so damn tired of hearing songs about pain
There's so much to learn, life's too short now to spend it afraid

Let the song last forever, let the song last a day
Let our love last a lifetime, let our love fade away
No matter what happens if we go our own ways
We'll be both walking wiser if walking away
