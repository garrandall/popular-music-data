Nobody knows what's
Going on in my mind but me
Nobody knows what's
Going on in my mind but me

Nobody knows what's
Going on in my mind but me
Nobody knows what's
Going on in my mind but me

And I love him (whoa whoa...)
And I love him (whoa whoa...)
Everybody says I'm too young
But what do they know, know, know...



And he loves me (whoa whoa...)
And he loves me (whoa whoa...)
Everybody says that he's no good
But what do they know

Nobody knows what's
Going on in my mind but me
Nobody knows what's
Going on in my mind

And he lets her know
(Lets me know)
Each and every night
(Each and every night)

When he holds her close to him
(Close to him)
When he holds her tight
(Holds me tight)

Everybody says that I'm wrong
But what do they know, know, know...

And I love him (whoa whoa...)
And I love him (whoa whoa...)
Everybody says give it up
But what do they know, know, know...
