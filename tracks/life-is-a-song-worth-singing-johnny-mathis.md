Life is a song worth singing
Why don't you?
Sing It!

You hold the key in the palm of your hand.
Use it!
Don't blame your life on the master plan
Change it!
Only you generate the power
To decide what to do with your life
Your a fool if you think your helpless
you control what you do with your life

Life is a song worth singing
Why don't you?
Sing It!

Don't like the way your living
To bad!
Can't change your life because it's out of your hand
so sad!
So you sit on your pants and holler
cause the world ain't been treating you right
Don't you know you contain the power
to control destiny with your mind
