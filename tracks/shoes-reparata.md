Johnny and Louise
Both on their knees
Praying to God, confess
So that He may bless them on
Their wedding day
Everybody pray
That they may be safe and true
As they say I do
Turn and run down the aisle
See papa smile
After throwing rice so far
Getting into the car
Mother didn’t give her abuse
She didn’t forget her shoes
Uncle Jerry opens the wine
Everybody has a good time

Tom brings his band
Bouzouki in his hand
Everything so grand and gay
We can frolic all day
As Louise starts to dance
Johnny gets a glance
From the other girls who smile
As they know all the while
When he picks up his bride
Somewhere they’ll hide
While they’re making love somewhere
There be music filling the air

Ah!

Tom brings his band
Bouzouki in his hand
Everything so grand and gay
We can frolic all day
As Louise starts to dance
Johnny gets a glance
From the other girls who smile
As they know all the while
When he picks up his bride
Somewhere they’ll hide
While they’re making love somewhere
There be music filling the air

Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup!

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Hey!
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Hey!
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Hey!
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
