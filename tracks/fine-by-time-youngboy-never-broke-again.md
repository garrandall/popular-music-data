This Vade on the keys
It's YoungBoy, nigga, Lil Top, what up? Yeah
Ayy, I'm still on that same shit, yeah
Free DDawg, nigga
I ain't tryna lose nothin', you heard me? I got it on me


Same nigga from the trenches, never changed up
We steady killin' 'cause these niggas tryna frame us
Came from the bottom, Northside baby, I done came up
Fuck throwin' that money in the air, I throw my gang up
She ain't feelin' like she wrong
When I saw she'll cross me, I damn near lost my mind
I gave 'em trust when I saw hate in front my eyes
God, tell me if it's love, got me blind
Or tell me if it be this glizzy steady spittin' out fire
I'm still fresh up out of prison, got another trial
Rich nigga, probably be convicted on another count
I keep it goin' up with three million and it's goin' higher
I do my dance while Big Dump watching from the sky
And I be feelin' like I'm dope, I don't realize
That I ain't wait for no dependent that don't love a slime
Don't give a fuck 'bout who you with 'cause she forever mine


Pain gon' flow (Pain gon' flow, it's on you if you gon' ever let it go)
Time gon' go (Time gon' go, just remember don't you ever let 'em take your soul)
Love move slow (Slow)
All this money never took the pain from a nigga, how I feel, they'll never know (They'll never know)
Niggas tryna take my life, keep a pole (Keep a pole)
All these drugs don't make it right, no (Oh)


Testify and we gon' slang that iron at the other side (Brrt, bah)
We blow them bitches back to back, ayy, what you on? (What you on?)
Quick to pick up when that murder call my phone, yeah (Brrt, brrt)
Give me a rush, I'm tryna bust that nigga's dome (Bitch nigga)
Grew from ambition, my pocket filled with them benjs
I'm ridin' 'round with that glizzy, pussy, come run up on that chrome
My grandpa fucked me up, he was walkin' out my home
He told me for to watch myself and keep my gun around
This nigga touched me to the heart, plenty battles I done fought
Don't move in daylight when it's dark, we at your top with them darts
This brand new Draco that I got, it hit and blow out your heart
I go by YoungBoy, but I always been Lil Top from the start
I got these bitches in my crib tryna fuck in the Royce
And I don't even know who she is, what she want me for?
It ain't no actin', how I'm actin', she realize I'm a thug
She know that I'll put this dick on her, includin' her girl
But how you feelin'? I been still dealin' with my pain
Still sending' money to DDawg, free him out them chains
Can't be around him, but I'm still thuggin' with my mains
It's a dirty game, this shit so slimy, it'll never change


Pain gon' flow (Pain gon' flow, it's on you if you gon' ever let it go)
Time gon' go (Time gon' go, just remember don't you ever let 'em take your soul)
Love move slow (Slow)
All this money never took the pain from a nigga, how I feel, they'll never know (They'll never know)
Niggas tryna take my life, keep a pole (Keep a pole)
All these drugs don't make it right, no (Oh)


All these drugs don't make it right, no
I've been fightin' for my life, keep a pole
At the crib, bitches wan' fuck me in the Rolls
And I don't even know who she is or what she want
Ain't understandin' how I feel, I been down
But that don't matter, what matter I'm bein' strong
I go to Marshall, what matters? Ayy, what you on?
Feelin' like no more that I can't touch you through my songs
