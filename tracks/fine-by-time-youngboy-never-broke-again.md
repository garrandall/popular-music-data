Slime

Bought my bitch a Birken bag but you cool up on they ass
I told you leave 'cause I wasn't ready
I couldn't get her out my head
The way you fuck me make think that you the one I should be with'
I feel no pain when I be high and I be fresher than a bitch
So I pop Perkys, yeah, yeah (I pop Perkys)
Talkin' 'bout.30's, yeah, yeah (Talkin' 'bout.30's)

Forty-thousand back in, spent soon as I get it (Oh, yeah, let's go)
Everybody that talk don't know how I'm livin' (They don't know)
I ain't got no bae, I ain't catchin' no feelin's (Yah)
We ain't gotta be together for to make some millions (I know)
She was just my friend and I wind up hittin' it (That's right)
But outta me can't get no commitment (That's right)
Fenti, Gucci, Louis (And Louis)

Young nigga totin' that choppa (Hrrrt)
Amiri jeans I'm stylin' (Errrf)

Took a Xan, now I can't think
And I'm not knowin' where my main one
Bought my ex from the bottom
Shawty tweakin', she don't know what she tryin'
To keep it real, she don't know where she ridin'
Society where them people be dyin'
I'm in the nawf where my life on the line
I'm with' my niggas, everybody got iron
Blasian, no, honey you fine
We not together and she not even tryin'
I made her a slime (Slatt)

Bought my nitch a Birken bag but you cool up on they ass
