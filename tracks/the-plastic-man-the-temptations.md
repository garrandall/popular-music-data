Well, he specializes in talkin' trash
Carries himself like the world's biggest spender
But he ain't never got no cash
The clothes he wears are second to none
He's a Jack of all trades and a master of none
Agrees with everything he knows nothin' about
So he doesn't feel left out
Secondary all the things in life he really wants
Being in is his thing
So he's got to keep up his front


Plastic man
Tryin' to get over any way he can
Plastic man
Trvin' to get over any way he can


Let me tell you about him
He's a, he's a, he's a self-preservationist, yes he is
Let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah
And a super-conversationalist, yes he is
Let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, he always borrows, never lends
He says, "Get off me, man! I'm with him, let me in!"
Says he's willing to stick through thick and thin
But when the chips are down
People find him if you can
(Plastic man)
Claim to fame he has none
Friends in this world, maybe one
He hates being just another face in the crowd
Giving another brother five and talkin' loud


Plastic man
Tryin' to get over any way he can
Plastic man
Tryin' to get over any way he can


I guess you know he does a little, uh, dippin' and dabbin'
In a game they call backstabbin' (Plastic man)
You better stop your fantasizin'
And start, buh-buh-boom-boom, to realizin' that
Black is black and white is white
Wrong is wrong, hey, and right is right


Plastic man
Tryin' to get over any way he can
Plastic man
Tryin' to get over any way he can
Plastic man
Tryin' to get over any way he can
Plastic man
Tryin' to get over any way he can
