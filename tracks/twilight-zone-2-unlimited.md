First to the bass in to the jam
Then let the music take command
Back to back to another dimension
Stop the force and pay some attention
Music to party, music to dance
The new follow-up of public demand
Slick as five da la megaphone
Take you down to the "Twilight Zone"

 Enter the clock and turn the body upside down
Grab the microphone it's upon the sound
You want more more you get
We're 2 Unlimited in effect!
Check up the sound and stop this distortion
When we get the fittess, here's another portion
Just lay back as we take control
Take you down into the "Twilight Zone"


 This is the twilight zone
And you're not on your own
We take you to the twilight zone
It is the twilight zone
You better shake your bones
And come on down the twilight zone

 Come on baby!
I'm gonna take you to the "Twilight Zone"

 Have a good time, take a break

 Hang with another first of the chapter
Straight to the heavyweight, for worst or better
Fishes in the way, found in the vicinity
Slaming DJ's with the rhyme capability
Listen to the jam as we go wild
Check your MC's versitile
Me and the lady howl megatone
Fuck you up in the "Twilight Zone"

 Woow
