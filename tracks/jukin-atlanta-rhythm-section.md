If you like to go jukin'
If you like the western swing
Outside of Austin, Texas
I know a cowboy's dream

It ain't much to look at
Just another cowboy club
But they got jukin'
And I got jukin' in my blood

When it comes to country music
I never liked it much
Till I heard it played
With that Texas touch

Kinda like to boogie
Just can't get enough
Don't you wanna go jukin'?
Let's go jukin'
I got jukin' in my blood

Let's go jukin'
Don't you wanna go jukin'
I got jukin' in my blood
All right, one time now, Dean

Deep in the heart of Texas
The jukin' never stops
It used to be the Texas Playboys
But now, old ZZ's Tops

Keeps on smoking
Lord, I hope it always does
Don't you wanna go jukin'
Let's go jukin'
I got jukin' in my blood

Let's go jukin'
Don't you wanna go jukin'
I got jukin' in my blood

If you like to go jukin'
If you like the western swing
Outside of Austin, Texas
I know a cowboy's dream

It ain't much to look at
Just another cowboy club
But they got jukin'
And I got jukin' in my blood

Let's go jukin'
Don't you wanna go jukin'
I got jukin' in my blood
Yes, I do
