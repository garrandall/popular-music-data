Ah, ha
Yeah, yeah
Ah, ha, yeah

Once an hour of the day
We threw at least fun away
Walk the streets half a year
Tryin' to find a new career

Now if you get a flu attack
For 30 days you're on your back
Through the night I've seen you dance
Baby, give me half a chance

It only takes a minute, girl
To fall in love, to fall in love
It only takes a minute, girl
To fall in love, let's fall in love

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Now in the unemployment lines
You can spend your life readin' signs
Waitin' for your interview
They can shoot the whole day for you, yeah

Now winter's gonna turn to spring
And you haven't accomplished a thing
(Haven't accomplished a thing)
So baby, leave a little time
'Cause you never know what's on my mind, yeah

It only takes a minute, girl
To fall in love, to fall in love
It only takes a minute, girl, yeah
To fall in love, let's fall in love

Bom, bom, bom, bom, fall in love
Bom, bom, bom, bom, fall in love
Bom, bom, bom, bom, fall in love
Bom, bom, bom, bom, fall in love
Bom, bom, bom, bom, fall in love
Bom, bom, bom, bom, fall in love

It only takes a minute, girl
Baby, to fall in love, to fall in love
It only takes a minute, girl
To fall in love, let's fall in love

It only takes a minute, girl
Baby, to fall in love, to fall in love
It only takes a minute, girl
To fall in love, to fall in love
