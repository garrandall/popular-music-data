(You got soul)
(You got soul)
(You got soul)

Hey, I can tell by the way you walk
You got soul, soul
I can tell by the way you talk
You got soul, soul
You somethin' deep inside
Nothin' in the world can hide

Yeah, you got soul
(You got soul)
Baby baby baby, you got soul
(You got soul)

Oh yeah
I can tell by the way you move
You got soul, yeah
Oh I can tell by the way you groove
You got soul

You got somethin' good as gold
Somethin' that'll never grow old
Yeah, you got soul
(You got soul)
Yeah, you got soul
(You got soul)

Ohhh, soul is hard to find
So why don't you come on now
And let it shine
Just let yourself be free
So the whole wide world can see
(Soul, soul, soul)

Yeah, I can tell by the way you dance
You got soul
I can tell by the way you romance
You got soul
You somethin' deep inside
Nothin' in the world can hide

Yeah, you got soul
(You got soul)
Yeah, you got soul
(You got soul)
Ohhh oh, you got soul
(You got soul)
Yeah yeah, I can tell by the way you walk
(You got soul)
Can tell by the way you talk
(You got soul)
Tell by the way you move
(You got soul)
