I can't take it
I'm so lonely
Gee, I need you so

I can't take it
Oh, I wonder
Why you had to go

But baby, every night I wake up crying
Tears on my pillow
An pain in my heart
You on my mind

I remember all the good times
That we had before
Oh, I remember an now my heart
My very soul cry's out for more

But baby, all your love for me is dying
Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
You on my mind

I'll always remember that day
You promised to love me
You said you'd love me to the very end
And I'll never forget
I'll never forget when you walked away from me
You walked out of my life to my very best friend
Ooh

Oh, baby, every night I wake up crying
Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
You on my mind

Yeah
Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
You on my mind

I got tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
You on my mind

I got tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
An you on my mind
