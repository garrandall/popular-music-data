All my life
And the hereafter
I've never seen
Seen one like you
You're a knife
Sharp and deadly
And it's me
That you cut into
But I don't mind
In fact I like it
Though I'm terrified
I'm turned on but scared of you


She's a monster
Beautiful monster
Beautiful monster
But I don't mind
And I need her
Said I need her
Beautiful monster
But I don't mind

No I don't mind (I don't mind I don't I don't mind...)
No I don't mind (I don't mind I don't I don't mind...)
No I don't mind (I don't mind I don't I don't mind...)
No I don't mind (I don't mind I don't I don't mind...)

In her eyes
There's love and fire
In my heart
She's burning through
But I don't mind
In fact I like it
Though I'm terrified
I'm turned on but scared of you


She's a monster (she's a monster)
Beautiful monster (beautiful monster)
Beautiful monster (beautiful monster yeah)
But I don't mind (I don't mind)
And I need her (and I need her)
Said I need her (said I need her)
Beautiful monster (whooah)
But I don't mind (I don't mind I don't I don't mind)
No I don't mind

Playing with my heart
And she's playing with my mind

And I don't mind I don't I don't mind
No I don't mind I don't I don't mind
No I don't mind I don't I don't mind
No I don't mind I don't I don't mind

(I don't mind I don't I don't mind) And I don't mind
(I don't mind I don't I don't mind) Said I don't mind
(I don't mind I don't I don't mind) And I don't mind
(I don't mind I don't I don't mind) Beautiful monster

She's a monster (she's a monster)
Beautiful monster (beautiful monster)
Beautiful monster (oo)
But I don't mind (but I don't mind)
And I need her (and I need her)
Said I need her (said I need her)
Beautiful monster (beautiful monster)
But I don't mind (oo)
No I don't mind

(Said I don't mind I don't I don't mind...) No I don't mind
(I don't mind I don't I don't mind...) No I don't mind
(I don't mind I don't I don't mind... Oooo...) No I don't mind
