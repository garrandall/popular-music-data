By Joe Esposito and Ali Willis
From the Stephen Stills album "Right By You"

I think of the two of us
An' how we both came to trust
In each other
And how we both have grown

Suddenly you're afraid
And letting it slip away

Just you remember we're
We're a very special love

Can't let go can't let go
You and me is all I know
It took a lot of love to
Get us to this place
Can't let go can't let go
I just keep holdin' on
Tell this impatient heart
This is no mistake

So much for promises
And what you think love is
Maybe time
Will find you what you need
Slow down
Things go through change
And pleasure can come from pain

Here's a memory
Of where we both belong

Didn't it work
For us so long

Together we'll find
What's gone

Can't let go can't let go
You and me is all I know
It took a lot of love to
Get us to this place
Can't let go can't let go
I just keep holdin' on
Tell this impatient heart
This is no mistake
