I want to be just like you
I want to be just like you

I wanna be just like you
I wanna be just the same
Whoo!
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I wanna be just like you
I wouldn't change a thing
I could be so cruel

You've got fingers that know where to touch me
Red lips like fruit on the vine
You set fire then tell me you're leaving
Just so you can lead me on some other night

You've got looks
You know how to use them
Such a tease since the day we met
It's not what you do
It's how you do it
And your role model I could never forget now

I wanna be just like you
I wanna be just the same
I wanna know all your moves
And play all your games
I wanna be just like you
I wouldn't change a thing
I could be so cruel
I wanna be just like you

You've got style
You wear next to nothing
I'll make you wanna wear nothing at all
I'm feeding on fire til you pray take it
Don't walk away honey
Leave me begging for more yeah

I wanna be just like you
I wanna be just the same
I wanna know all your moves
And play all your games
I wanna be just like you
I wouldn't change a thing
I could be so cruel
I wanna be just like you

Like You

I wanna be just like you
I wanna be just the same
I wanna know all your moves
And play all your games
I wanna be just like you
I wouldn't change a thing
I could be so cruel
I wanna be just like you

Repeat to fade
