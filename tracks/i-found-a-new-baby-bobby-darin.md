It's over, all over
And soon somebody else
Will make a fuss about you
But how about me?

It's over, all over
And soon somebody else
Will tell his friends about you
But how about me?

You'll find somebody new
But what am I to do?
I'll still remember you
When you have forgotten

And maybe, a little baby
Will climb upon your knee
And put it's tiny arms around you
But how about me?
How about me?
