Standing on the mountain
Looking down on a city
The way I feel is
A doggone pity

Teardrops falling from
The mountain side
Many times I've been there
Many times I've cried

We used to be so happy
When we were in love
High on a mountain of love

Night after night
Standing here alone
Weeping my heart out
Until gray dawn

Hoping that you love me
And you'll come here too
Hoping just by chance
I'll get a glimpse of you

Trying hard to find you
Somewhere up above
High on the mountain of love

The mountain of love
The mountain of love
You should be ashamed
Used to be the mountain of love
But you just changed your name

I said way down below
There's a half a million people
Somewhere there's a church
With a great tall steeple

Inside the church
Altar filled with flowers
Wedding bells are ringing
They should've been ours

That's why I'm so lonely
Way up above
High on the mountain of love

Well, the mountain of love
The mountain of love
You should be ashamed
Used to be the mountain of love
But you just changed your name

I said way down below
There's a half a million people
Somewhere there's a church
With a great tall steeple

Inside the church
Altar filled with flowers
Wedding bells are ringing
They should've been ours

Well, that's why I'm so lonely
Way up above
High on the mountain of love

High on the mountain of love
High on the mountain of love
