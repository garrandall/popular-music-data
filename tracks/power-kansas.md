Sometimes a smile can deceive the one who has made you promise
Suddenly you can't believe, the truth only leaves you cold
Sometimes the answers you fear are there on the face in the mirror
Something the world needs to hear but no one is even listening

Power It takes Power Power It takes Power
To back up the things you say
Power It takes Power Power It takes Power
To cut through the chains Breakaway

Fortune can werar a disguise Pride is a grand illusion
And when it's your name up in lights fate proves this one conclusion
Sometimes the answers you fear are there on the face in the mirror
Something the world needs to hear the truth only leaves you cold

Power It takes Power Power It takes Power
To back up the things you say
Power It takes Power Power It takes Power
To cut through the chains Breakaway
Power It takes Power Power It takes Power
To fight back and not be afraid
Power It takes Power Power It takes Power
To cut through the chains Breakaway

All that you see someday will be
Lost in the shadows of time
Mountains must fall Someday this all
Will be darkness where light used to shine
All I Wanted

You say it's time to stay behind
All I wanted was to hold you
All I wanted was to touch you

No need for blame cause we're not the same
All I wanted was to love you
That's all I wanted

How many times will it take
Hurting me the way you do
How many times till I break
You're hurting me the way I'm loving you the way I do

It's not so strange for us to change
All I wanted was to love you That's all I wanted

How many times will it take
Hurting me the way you do
How many times till I break
You're hurting me the way

I'm loving you the way I do
