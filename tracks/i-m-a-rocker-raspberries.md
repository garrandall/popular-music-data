Back beat boogie got a hold on me
Make me wanna jump and shout
Twisting like a top
I never want to stop tonight
You surely look like a magazine
And you can move like I've never seen
Reeling and a-rocking, babe
Come on and dance with me
I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I've been a-boogieing since I ditched the stroller
So come on hold me tight
And we can rock the night away
I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I've been a-boogieing since I ditched the stroller
So come on hold me tight
And we can rock the night away
Tight booted teenie with the smiling face
Make me want to smile and shake
Come on out today
And shimmy like a rattlesnake
You surely look like a movie queen
And you can move like I've never seen
Reeling and a-rocking, babe
Come on and dance with me
I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I've been a-boogieing since I ditched the stroller
So come on hold me tight
And we can rock the night away
I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I've been a-boogieing since I ditched the stroller
So come on hold me tight
And we can rock the night away
I get this feeling when I hear that beat
I gotta jump and get up on the table
'Cause when that rhythm and blues electrifies my shoes
I get the message like it came by cable, hey
I get this feeling when I hear that beat
I gotta jump and get up on the table
'Cause when that rhythm and blues electrifies my shoes
I get the message like it came by cable
Back beat boogie got a hold on me
Make me wanna jump and shout
Twisting like a top
I never want to stop tonight
You surely look like a magazine
And you can move like I've never seen
Reeling and a-rocking, babe
Come on and dance with me, oh
I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I've been a-boogieing since I ditched the stroller
So come on hold me tight
And we can rock the night away
I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I've been a-boogieing since I ditched the stroller
So come on hold me tight
And we can rock the night away
Hold me tight
And we can rock the night away
So come on, hold me tight
And we can rock the night away
