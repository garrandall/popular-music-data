Hello darlin', nice to see you, it's been a long time
You're still the man that you used to be
How's your new love are you happy hope you're doing fine
Just to know it means so much to me
What's that darlin', how'm I doin', guess I'm doing all right
Except I can't sleep and I cry all night till dawn
What I'm tryin' to say is I love you and I miss you
And I'm so sorry that I did you wrong
Look up darlin', won't you kiss me just for old time sake
Won't you hold me in your arms one more time
Thank you darlin', may God bless you and may each step you take
Bring you closer to the things you seek to find
Goodbye darlin', I gotta go now, I gotta try to find a way
To lose these mem'ries of the love so warm and true
And if you should ever find it in your heart to forgive me
Come back darlin', I'll be waiting for you
