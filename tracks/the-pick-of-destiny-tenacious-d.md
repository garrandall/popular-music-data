Cause it's the Pick
Of Destiny child
You know we will be rockin' cause it's fucking insane

It's just the Pick
Of Destiny child
More precious than a diamond on a platinum chain

In Venice Beach there was a man named Kage
When he was buskin he was all the rage
He met Jables and he taught him well
All the techniques that were developed in hell
Cock pushups and the power slide
Gig simulation now theres nowhere to hide
They formed a band they named Tenacious D
And then they got the Pick of Destiny

Cause it's the Pick
Of Destiny child
You know we will be rockin' cause it's fucking insane

It's just the Pick
Of Destiny child
Our tasty grooves are better than a chicken chow mein

Cause he who is sleazy
Is easy to pleasy
And she who is juicy
Must be loosy-goosey
And he who is groovy
Will be in my movie
So come on

The wizard and the demon had a battle royale
The demon almost killed him with an evil kapow
But then he broke his tooth and thus the demon said ow

Cause it's the Pick
Of Destiny child
You know we will be rockin' cause it's fucking insane

It's just the Pick
Of Destiny child
You know our movie's better than a Citizen Kane

Cause he who's a geezer
Must live in my freezer
And she who is snarkey
Is full of malarkey
And he who is groovy
Must be in my movie
So come on

Oh! Cause if you're a diva
Then go to Geneva
And if you're a croney
Then suck on my boney
And if you are groovy
Then get in my movie

It's called the Pick of Destiny
The Pick of Destiny
