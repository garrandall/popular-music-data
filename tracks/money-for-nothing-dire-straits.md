I want myâI want my MTV 

Now look at them yo-yos, that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' and your chicks for free

Now that ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Lemme tell ya them guys ain't dumb
Maybe get a blister on your little finger
Maybe get a blister on your thumb

We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these colour TVs

See the little faggot with the earring and the make-up
Yeah buddy that's his own hair
That little faggot got his own jet airplane
That little faggot he's a millionaire

We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchens deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these colour TVs

We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchens deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these colour TVs

I shoulda learned to play the guitar
I shoulda learned to play them drums
Look at that mama, she got it stickin' in the camera man
We could have some fun

And he's up there, what's that? Hawaiian noises?
Bangin' on the bongoes like a chimpanzee
Oh, that ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Get your money for nothin', get your chicks for free

We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these colour TVs

Listen here

Now that ain't workin' that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' and your chicks for free

Money for nothin' and chicks for free
Get your money for nothin' and your chicks for free
Money for nothin', chicks for free
Get your money for nothin', chicks for free

Money for nothin', chicks for free
Get you money for nothin', get your chicks for free
Get you money for nothin', and the chicks for free
Get you money for nothin', and the chicks for free

Look at that, look at that

I want myâI want myâI want my MTV 

Get you money for nothin', and the chicks for free
Money for nothin', chicks for free
Get you money for nothin', and the chicks for free
Get you money for nothin', and the chicks for free

Easy-easy money for nothin', easy-easy chicks for free
Easy-easy money for nothin', chicks for free

That ain't workin'

Money for nothin' chicks for free
Money for nothin' chicks for free
