Just running scared
Each place we go
So afraid
That he might show
Just running scared
What would I do
If he came back
And wanted you
Just running scared
Feeling low
Running scared
You loved him so
Just running scared
Afraid to lose
If he came back
Which one would you choose
Then all at once
He was standing there
So sure of himself
His head in the air
My heart was breaking
Which one would it be?
You turned around and walked away
With me
