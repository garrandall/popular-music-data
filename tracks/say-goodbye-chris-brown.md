Look, we gotta talk. Dang, I know, I know, but it'sâit's just some things I gotta get off my chest. Alright.

Listen.

Baby, come here, sit down. Let's talk.
I got a lot to say. So, I guess I'll start by
Saying that I love you,
But you know this thing ain't been
No walk in the park for us.

I swear it'll only take a minute.
You'll understand when I finish.
And I don't wanna see you cry,
But I don't wanna be the one to tell you a lie.

So, how do you let it go
When youâyou just don't know
What's on the other side of the door,
When you're walking out?
Talk about it.

Everything I tried to remember to say just went out my head.
So I'm 'a do the best I can to get you to understand
'Cause I know

There's never a right time to say goodbye,
But I gotta make the first move
'Cause if I don't you're gonna start hating me,
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you.
Girl, it's not you. It's me.
I kinda gotta figure out what I need.

There's never a right time to say goodbye,
But we know
That we gotta go
Our separate ways.
And I know it's hard,
But I gotta do it,
And it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time,
Right time to say goodbye.

Girl, I know your heart is breaking,
And a thousand times I found myself asking,
"Why? Why? Why am I taking so long to say this?"

But trust me, girl, I never
Meant to crush your world, and I never
Thought I would see the day we grew apart.

And I wanna know
How do you let it go
When youâyou just don't know
What's on the other side of the door,
When you're walking out?
Talk about it.

Girl, I hope you understand
What I'm tryna say.
We just can't go on
Pretending that we get along.
Girl, how you're not gonna see it?

There's never a right time to say goodbye,
But I gotta make the first move
'Cause if I don't you're gonna start hating me,
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you.
Girl, it's not you. It's me.
I kinda gotta figure out what I need.

There's never a right time to say goodbye,
But we know
That we gotta go
Our separate ways.
And I know it's hard,
But I gotta do it,
And it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time,
Right time to say goodbye.

Listen to your heart,
Girl, you know,
We should be apart,
Baby, IâI just can't do it.
IâI just can't do it.

Listen to your heart,
Girl, you know,
We should be apart,
Baby, IâI just can't do it,
And sometimes it makes me wanna cry.

Do you hear me crying?
There's never a right time.

There's never a right time to say goodbye,
But I gotta make the first move
'Cause if I don't you're gonna start hating me
You're gonna start hating me, baby.
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you.
No more.
Girl, it's not you. It's me.
I kinda gotta figure out what I need
About you and me.

There's never a right time to say goodbye,
Oh, no, it ain't.
But we know,
That we gotta go
Our separate ways.
And I know it's hard,
But I gotta do it,
And it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time,
Right time to say goodbye.

There's never a right time to say goodbye,
But I gotta make the first move
'Cause if I don't, you're gonna start hating me,
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you.
Girl, it's not you. It's me.
I kinda gotta figure out what I need.

There's never a right time to say goodbye,
But we know,
That we gotta go
Our separate ways.
And I know it's hard,
But I gotta do it,
And it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time,
Right time to say, right time, right time, right time.
