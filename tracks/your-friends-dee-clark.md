Your friends
All of your friends (your friends)
All of your (your friends)
All of your friends (your friends)

You know when you
Get on your feet again
Ev'ryone'll wanna be your friend

When you (hoo)
Get on your feet again (see the friends)
Ev'ryone'll wanna be your friend

Ev'ryone'll will wanna shake your hand
Ev'ryone'll will wanna see you again
And they'll all pat you on your back
They'll all try to tell you
That they're glad you're back

When you (when you)
Get on your feet again (see the friends)
Ev'ryone'll wanna be your friend

Your friends
All of your friends
All of your (your friends)
All of your (your friends) friends

But when you are down an out
There's not a friend in this world
To help you out

But when you (when you)
Get on your feet again
Ev'ryone'll wanna be your friend

(They told you they would stand by you)

Stand by you
(And never let you down)
And never let you down
But when you started sinkin' low
There wasn't one of your friends to be found!
Help!

When your, your ship comes in
Surprise all of your so-called friends
Give them, give them, a helpin' hand
Show them all that you're a bigger man

When you (when you)
Get on your feet again
Ev'ryone'll wanna be your friends

Your friends (your friends)
Talkin' bout your friends (your friends)
Talkin' bout your friends (your friends)
Talkin' bout your friends (your friends)

Talkin' bout all of your (your friends)
All of your
All of your (your friends)
All of your friends (your friends)
All of your friends (your friends)
Ooo (your friends)
All, all, all (your friends)

FADES-

Woo (your friends)
All, all, wah-oo!
