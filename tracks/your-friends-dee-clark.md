So she can't go out tonight again 
Her sister's sick, she's gotta baby-sit 
Yeah, that sounds like a pretty good excuse 
Now you didn't hear any of this from me 
But things aren't always what they seem 
Brace yourself, this may come as a shock to you 

Girls lie, too 
We don't care how much money you make 
What you drive or what you weigh 
Size don't matter anyway 
Girls lie, too 
Don't think you're the only ones 
Who bend it, break it, stretch it some 
We learn from you 
Girls lie, too 

We can't wait to hear about your round of golf 
We love to see deer heads hanging on the wall 
And we like Hooter's for their hotwings too 
Other guys never cross our minds 
We don't wonder what it might be like 
How could it be any better than it is with you 



Yeah, girls lie, too 
We always forgive and forget 
The cards and flowers you never sent 
Will never be brought up again 
Girls lie, too 
Old gray sweatpants turn us on 
We like your friends and we love your mom 
And that's the truth 
Girls lie, too 
Yeah that's the truth 
Girls lie, too 

No, we don't care how much hair you have 
Yeah, that looks good 
Comb it over like that
