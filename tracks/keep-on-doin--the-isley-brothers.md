Whoa I said it once babe
Now I'm gonna say it (say it) say it again
To each his own
Do what you want to do

I'm gonna keep on doing what I'm doing
Til I can't do what I'm doin no more
No no
I'm gonna keep on doing what I'm doing
Til I can't do what I'm doin no more
Good god

I'm going straight ahead
Just like I said
I might do some good
I wish I could

I got to keep on doing what I'm doing
Til I can't do it no more
No no
No No no no no
Yeah
Keep on doing what I'm doing
Til I can't do what I'm doing no more
Look out y'all
I'm gonna keep on doing what I'm doing
Til I can't do what I'm doing no more
Keep on doing (get on y'all)
What you're doing
Til I can't
Do what you're doing no more
To the children (Keep on doing)
All over the world (What you doing)
Keep on (Til you can't)
Do what you're doing no more

You know what you doing
But you keep on doing it yeah (keep on doing)
If that's what you're doing children (what you're doing)
Until you can't
Do what you're doing no more

And I like what you do

Keep on doing (all over the world)
What you're doing (let the sunshine in)
Til you can't (yes children)
Do what you're doing no more

Keep on doing
What you're doing (if that's what you're doing children)
Til you can't (as long as you don't let nobody stop you now)
Do it now!

Keep on doing (keep on doing)
What you're doing (lord if it feels good)
Til you can't (oh do it children)
Do what you're doing no more

Keep on doing (if that's what you're doing)
What you're doing (if you want to make love)
Til you can't (do it children)
Do what you're doing no more

Keep on doing (do it children)
What you're doing (lord if it feels good)
Til you can't (go on and do it now)
Do what you're doing no more
