Tell me when you need it again
Tell me when you need it again
What s comin' over your mind?
You wanted my sugar this time
We're good together i know
Why would you go lookin' for new love tomorrow?

(why won't you) tell me when you need it again
(come on and) tell me when you need it again
(why don't you) tell me when you need it again
(why don't you) tell me when you need it again
Tell me when you need it baby
I can keep you satisfied
Tell me when you need it baby
So I can keep you satisfied

You say we're needin' a change
We should be doin' other things
But when you're feelin' my touch
You don't be complaining as much

(why won't you) tell me when you need it again
(come on and) tell me when you need it again
(why don't you) tell me when you need it again
(why don't you) tell me when you need it again
Tell me when you need it baby
I can keep you satisfied
Tell me when you need it baby
So I can keep you satisfied

You say you needed my sugar
And now you're changin' your mind
Why don't you get it together?
And stop wasting my time
Tell me when you need me baby
I can keep you satisfied
Tell me when you need me baby
So I can keep you satisfied
