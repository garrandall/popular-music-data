Uh
Yeah


I could wait all night and day
To go to a party, sit down and wait
Give my request to the DJ
'Cause my song, he's gotta play (Just play my song)
And when I hear that beat, I get my body up out my seat
I grab a guy and move my feet
He's playing my song


Play, come on play that song
Play it all night long
Just turn it up and turn it on
Play, come on, DJ, play that song
You know that it turns me on (DJ, just play that song)
Just turn it up and turn it on
DJ, just play that song
'Cause I wanna be dancing (DJ) all night long
Play my, play my, play my, play my
Play my favorite song (Uh)


I don't care if everybody's gone
Turn it up 'cause it turns me on
Keep dancing all night long
Feels so right that it can't be wrong (Can't be wrong)
I get chills up and down my spine
Whenever I hear that song of mine
When it stops, better press rewind (Play that shit again)
Let me hear it one more time


Play, come on play that song
Play it all night long
Just turn it up and turn it on
Play, come on, DJ, play that song
You know that it turns me on (DJ, just play that song)
'Cause I wanna be dancing all night long (You know this song)
Play, come on play that song
Play it all night long
Just turn it up, and turn it on (One more time)
Play, come on, DJ, play that song
You know that it turns me on (DJ, just play that song)
'Cause I wanna be dancing all night long


I just wanna dance, is that a crime?
Alright then
Oh, uh
Oh (Alright)
(Yeah, that's the hotness right here)
(Play, play, play, play)
Play, come on play that song (Now, Mr. DJ)
Play it all night long (I've asked you three times already)
DJ, just play that song
Just turn it up and turn it on (Play my motherfuckin' song)
Play, come on, DJ, play that song (Haha)
You know that it turns me on (DJ, just play that song)
(Turn it up, turn it up)
'Cause I wanna be dancing all night long
(Turn it up, turn it up, turn the track)


Play, come on play that song (Oh)
Play it all night long
Just turn it up and turn it on
Play, come on, DJ, play that song
You know that it turns me on (DJ, just play that song)
'Cause I wanna be dancing all night long
Play, come on play that song (Turn it up)
Play it all night long (Play it all night long)
Just turn it up, and turn it on
Play, come on, DJ, play that song (Uh-huh)
You know that it turns me on (DJ, just play that song)
Just turn it up, and turn it on
