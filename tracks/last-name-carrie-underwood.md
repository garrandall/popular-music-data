Last night I got served a little bit too much of that poison, baby
Last night I did things I'm not proud of
And I got a little crazy
Last night I met a guy on the dance floor and I let him call me "Baby"

And I don't even know his last name
My momma would be so ashamed
It started off "Hey, cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into "Oh, no! What have I done?"
And I don't even know his last name

We left the club right 'bout around 3 o'clock in the morning
His Pinto sitting there in the parking lot, well, it should have been a warning
I had no clue what I was getting into
So, I'll blame it on the Cuervo
Oh, where did my manners go?

I don't even know his last name
Oh, my momma would be so ashamed
It started off "Hey, cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into "Oh, no! What have I done?"
And I don't even know his last name

Here we go

Today I woke up thinking about Elvis somewhere in Vegas
I'm not sure how I got here
Or how this ring on my left hand just appeared outta nowhere
I gotta go take the chips and the Pinto and hit the road
They say, "What happens here, stays here, all of this will disappear."

There's just one little problem

I don't even know my last name
Oh, my momma would be so ashamed
It started off "Hey, cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into "Oh, no! What have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name

What have I done
What have I done
What have I done

Oh, what have I done?
I don't even know my last name

Well, it turned into "Oh, no! What have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name

It started off "Hey, cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh, no! What have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name
