But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause

Because you know I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble, I'm all 'bout that

What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in

You're all that matters to me, oh...

I've been shaking, I've been shaking, yeah...

And I won't be who you ask me to be

We don't have to be ordinary
Make your best mistakes
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby be the life of the party

Something big I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing and pulling and it's grabbing me
Feel it in my bones like
Whoa oh oh oh oh...
Something big I feel it happening

Take a piece of my heart
And make it all your own
So when we are apart
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone

Oh oh oh...

Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me
One more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
I'm shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

I know I can treat you better
Than he can
Any girl like you deserves a gentleman

So please have mercy, mercy on my heart
Please have mercy, mercy on my heart

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back

It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood

Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
'Cause I can't seem to get you off my mind
