If I am dreaming you've got your arms around me
Wake me when it's over, wake me when it's over, not before
And if I'm dreaming that love at last has found me
Let me go on dreaming

Wake me when it's over
And then let me go to sleep, mm, again

It's hard to believe, my dear, that you're here at all
Incredible, I pinch myself, you don't disappear at all
So, if I'm hearing you tell some small-town justice
You will not forsake me, takin' vows to make me yours ever more
Then darling, wake me when it's over, and not before

Ooh, wake me when it's over
Wake me when it's over and then back to sleep again

It's hard to believe, my dear, that you're here at all
Incredible, you don't disappear at all
So, tell that small-town justice you'll take me
Tell me you'll make me yours ever more
Then darling, wake me when it's over, not before
