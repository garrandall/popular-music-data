See the tree how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long, it wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted, it was just a twig

And then the first snow came
And she ran out to brush the snow away so it wouldn't die
Came running in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself, I laughed till I cried

She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved her so
And I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago

And it would sure embarrass her
When I came home from working late 'cause I would know
That she'd been there a crying
Over some sad and silly late, late show

And honey, I miss you
And I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

She wrecked the car and she was sad
So afraid that I'd be mad but what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say she saw through me and hugged my neck

I came home unexpectedly
Found her crying needlessly in the middle of the day
And it was in the early spring
When flowers bloom and Robins sing, she went away

And honey, I miss you
And I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

Yes, one day while I was not at home
While she was there and all alone the angels came
Now all I have is memories
Of honey and I wake up nights and call her name

And now my life's an empty stage
Where honey lived and honey played and love grew up
A small cloud passes overhead
And cries down on the flower bed that honey loved

Yes, see the tree how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long, it wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted, it was just a twig

And honey, I miss you
And I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could
