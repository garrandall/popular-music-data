Da da da da
Tell her
Tell her she's lovely
Tell her
She knows how to suffer

People wanna figure that
They're the only ones
Who really are alone

People wanna figure that
They're the only ones
Who really are alone

People are so beautiful in love
People are so wonderful to love

(CHORUS)
People wanna think that
They're the only ones who
Really are alone, oh
Thinking a little bit over
Trying to know one another
Waiting a little bit longer
Thinking a little bit over, yeah

Tell her
Love is a song
Sing out, sing out
All night long

(CHORUS)
Tell her
Tell her she's lovely
Tell her
Tell her she's lovely

Tell her
Tell her she's lovely
Tell her
Tell her she's lovely

Tell her
Tell her she's lovely...
