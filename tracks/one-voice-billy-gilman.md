Some kids have and some kids don't
And some of us are wondering why.
and mom won't watch the news at night
There's too much stuff (that's) making her cry.
We need some help
Down here on earth
A thousand prayers, a million words
But one voice was heard.

A house, a yard, a neighborhood
Where you can ride your new bike to school.
A kind of world where Mom and dad
Still believe in the golden rule
Life's not that simple
Down here on earth.
A thousand prayers, a million words
But one voice was heard

One voice,
One voice, one simple word
Hearts know what to say
One dream can change the world
But keep believing
'Til you find your way

Yesterday while walking home
I saw some kid on Newbury Road
He pulled the pistol from his bag
And tossed it in the river below
Thanks for the help
Down here on earth
A thousand prayers, a million words
But one voice was heard
One voice was heard
One voice was heard
