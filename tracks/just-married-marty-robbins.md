Just married this mornin'
How happy they are
"Just Married" written on
The window of a-their car
It broke my heart
To see them drive away
I lost the one I love today

Dressed all in white satin
White lace in her hair
She looked so lovely
It was more than I could bear
Some people guessed the way I felt inside
They saw the tears I could not hide

I should have stayed at home
I knew what was in store
But somethin' made me come
To see her just once more
Just married this mornin'
How happy they are
"Just Married" written on
The window of a-their car
It broke my heart
To see them drive away
I lost the one I love today

I should have stayed at home
I knew what was in store
But somethin' made me come
To see her just once more
Just married this mornin'
How happy they are
"Just Married" written on
The window of a-their car
It broke my heart
To see them drive away
I lost the one I love today
