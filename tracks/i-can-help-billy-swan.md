If you got a problem
Don't care what it is
If you need a hand
I can assure you this

I can help
I got two strong arms
I can help
It would sure do me good to do you good
Let me help

It's a fact that people get lonely
Ain't nothing new
But a woman like you
Baby should never have the blues

Let me help
I got two for me
Let me help
It would sure do me good to do you good
Let me help

When I go to sleep at night
You're always a part of my dream
Holding me tight and
Telling me everything I wanna hear

Don't forget me baby
All you gotta do is call
You know how I feel about ya
If I can do anything at all
Let me help

If your child needs a daddy
I can help
It would sure do me good to do you good
Let me help

When I go to sleep at night
You're always a part of my dream
Holding me tight and
Telling me everything I wanna hear

Don't forget me, baby
All you gotta do is call
You know how I feel about you
If I can do anything at all
Let me help

If your child needs a daddy
I can help
It would sure do me good to do you good
Let me help
