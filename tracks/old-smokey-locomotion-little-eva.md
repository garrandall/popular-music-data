On top of Old Smokey
It was quiet before
But since they learned the Loco-motion
It ain't quiet no more

Well everybody you see there
Has a smile on his face
Cause since they learned the Loco-motion
It's a real swingin' place

Well every Friday night now
They have a record hop
And it ain't til Monday morning
That the dancin' stop(s)

(On top of Old Smokey) On top of Old Smokey
(It was quiet before) He was quiet before
(But since they learned the Loco-motion)
But since they learned the Loco-motion
(It ain't quiet no more) He ain't quiet no more

(They threw away their fiddles) They threw away them fiddles
(And their honkey guitars) And their honky guitars
(Now they even have fan clubs) Now they even have fan clubs
(At all the record stores) At all the record stores

(On top of Old Smokey) On top of Old Smokey baby
(Was smokey before) Well do you hear what I say
(And let me tell you Old Smokey) And let me tell you Old Smokey
(Ain't honky no more) It ain't a honky no more

(On top of Old Smokey) On top of Old Smokey
(Was smokey before) Oh hear what I say
(And let me tell you Old Smokey) And let me tell you Old Smokey
(Ain't honky no more) And that's a natural fact

(On top of Old Smokey) On top of Old Smokey
(Was honky before) He was a honky before
(And let me tell you Old Smokey) Oh yeah baby
(Ain't honky no more) He ain't a honky no more
