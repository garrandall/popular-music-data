Sue, why don't we go away 
(go away) 
Sue, we could leave today 
(leave today) 
Sue, what would your daddy say 
(daddy say) 
Sue, will he see things our way 
(our way) 

Come on, baby, we'll fund us a preacher man 
In time your daddy will understand 
Sue, who cares what people say 
(people say) 
Sue, let's leave today 
(leave today) 
I'll find us a secret hide-away 
I'll get a job and I'll work everyday 
Sue, you gotta be my baby 
(be my baby) 
Sue, you gotta be mine 
(all the time) 
Sue, you gotta be my baby 
(be my baby)
