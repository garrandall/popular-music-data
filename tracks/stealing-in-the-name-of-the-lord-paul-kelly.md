There's a man,
On the corner,
Raisin' a congregation,
Sayin' that he's the one,
Brothers and sisters,
That's gonna bring us all salvation.

Sayin' that he's the one,
To make a way for,
He's gonna do it,
With no hesitation.

Sayin' step!
In the land,
Can you spare a dime?

I heard him say,
Step!
Right on up.
How you this evenin'?
Drop a buck.

People I tell ya,
What I've seen.
A?

Ain't much difference,
In what he's doin',
Good people,
For?

That man is...
(Stealin' in the name of the lord)
Sayin' God's gonna mess ya...
(Stealin' in the name of the lord)

Oh, oh, oh.
It's happenin' every day.
This man, he'll walk,
Up to ya,
And look ya in the eye,
Put his hand,
On your shoulder,
And tell ya,
A big fat lie.

He'll tell ya,
God's gonna bless ya, children,
If you put your faith in me.
Huh!

And he'll pass the tray,
While the choir's singin',
? In' My God To Me.

Step!
In the line!
Can you spare a dime?
I heard him say,
Step!
Right on up, good people!
Drop a buck.

That man is...
(Stealin' in the name of the lord)
That's what he's doin'...
(Stealin' in the name of the lord)

Comes confession time!
That's a time to spill your mind.
He sits back in his lazy chair,
And listens to ya testify.

When that's over,
He puts his hands on your shoulder.
Tells you,
ALL is forgiven.
The man can't be colder.

Step!
In the line!
Can you spare a dime?
I heard him say,
Step!
Right on up, good people.
Drop a buck.

That man is...
(Stealin' in the name of the lord)
Sayin' God's gonna bless ya!
(Stealin' in the name of the lord)
He's gonna save your soul!
(Stealin'!)
That's what he said.
(Stealin'!)
Pick your life up and make you whole.
(Stealin'!)
Yeah, that's what he said.
(Stealin'!)
This man will rob ya!
(Stealin'!)
Yes he will.
(Stealin'!)
He'll steal your money,
(Stealin'!)
And tell ya you don't need your money.
(Stealin'!)
Stealin!
(Stealin'!)
Stealin!
(Stealin'!)
Stealin!
