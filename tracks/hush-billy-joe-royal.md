Na nanana nanana nanana

There's a certain little girl that's on my mind
Great gosh and body, she looks so fine
She's the best girl that I've ever had
And sometimes she sure makes me feel so bad

Na nanana nanana nanana

Hush, hush
I thought I heard her calling my name now
Hush, hush
She broke my heart, but I love her just the same now
Hush, hush
I thought I heard her calling my name now
Hush, hush
I need her loving and I'm not ashamed now

(Hush, hush) Early in the morning
(Hush, hush) Late in the midnight
(Hush, hush) I want it and I need it now
(Hush, hush) Got to, gotta have it

She's got love that's like quicksand
It only took one touch of her hand
It blew my mind and I am in so deep
That I can't eat, y'all, and I can't sleep

Na nanana nanana nanana

Hush, hush
I thought I heard her calling my name now
Hush, hush
She broke my heart, but I love her just the same now
Hush, hush
I thought I hear her calling my name now
Hush, hush
I need her loving and I'm not ashamed now

(Hush, hush) Early in the morning
(Hush, hush) Late in the midnight
(Hush, hush) I want it and I need it, y'all
(Hush, hush) Got to, gotta have it

Hush, hush
I thought I heard her calling my name now
Hush, hush
She broke my heart, but I love her just the same now
Hush, hush
Didn't you hear her calling my name now?
Hush, hush
I need her loving and I'm not ashamed now

(Hush, hush) Early in the morning
(Hush, hush) Late in the midnight
(Hush, hush) I want it and I need it now
(Hush, hush) Got to, gotta have it

(Hush, hush) Whoa
(Hush, hush) Yeah
(Hush, hush) Early in the evening
(Hush, hush) Lord in the midnight
(Hush, hush) Got to, gotta have it
(Hush)
