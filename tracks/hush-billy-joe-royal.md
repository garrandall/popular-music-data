I got a certain little girl, she's on my mind
No doubt about it, she looks so fine
She's the best girl that I ever had
Sometimes she's gonna make me feel so bad

Hush hush, I thought I heard her calling my name now
Hush hush, she broke my heart but I love her just the same now
Hush hush, I thought I heard her calling my name now
Hush hush, I need your love and I'm not to blame now

Love love, they got it early in the morning
Love love, they got it late in the evening
Love love, well I want that needing
Love love, oh I gotta get ahead of it

She's got a love like quicksand
Only took one touch of her hand
Blow my mind and I'm in so deep
That I can't eat and I can't sleep

Listen

Hush hush, I thought I heard her calling my name now
Hush hush, she broke my heart but I love her just the same now
Hush hush, thought I heard her calling my name now
Hush hush, I need that love and I'm not to blame now

Love love, they got it early in the morning
Love love, they got it late in the evening
Love love, ooh I want that needing
Love love, hey I gotta get ahead of it
