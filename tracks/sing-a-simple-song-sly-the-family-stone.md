 Sing a simple song

 I'm talkin' talkin' talkin' talkin' talkin' in my sleep
 I'm walkin' walkin' walkin' walkin' walkin' in the street
 Time is passin' I grow older Things are happening fast
All I have to hold onto is a simple song at last
Let me hear you say


 Sing a simple song
Try a little do re me fa so la ti do

 Yeah, yeah, yeah, etc.
 I'm livin' livin' livin' life with all its ups and downs
 I'm givin' givin' givin' love and smilin' at the frowns

 You're in trouble when you find it's hard for you to smile
A simple song might make it better for a little while
Let me hear you say


 I'm talkin' talkin' talkin' talkin'
 I'm walkin' walkin' walkin' walkin
 I'm livin' livin' livin' love
 I'm livin' lovin' know about lovin'

 Everybody sing together
