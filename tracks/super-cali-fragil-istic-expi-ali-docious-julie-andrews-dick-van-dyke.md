It's...
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Even though the sound of it
Is something quite atrocious,
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound precocious,
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay,
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay!

Because I was afraid to speak
When I was just a lad,
Me father gave me nose a tweak
And told me I was bad!
But then one day I learned a word
To saved me achin' nose,

The biggest word you ever heard
And this is how it goes: Oh!
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Even though the sound of it
Is something quite atrocious,
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound precocious,
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay!

He traveled all around the world
And everywhere he went,
He'd use his word and all would say
"There goes a clever gent"

When Dukes and maharajas
Pass the time of day with me,
I'd say me special word and then
They'd ask me out to tea,

Oh.
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Even though the sound of it
Is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound precocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay!

Now you can say it backwards which is
Docious-ali-expi-listic-fragi-cali-rupus
But that's going a bit too far, don't you think?

So when the cat has got your tongue
There's no need for dismay
Just summon up this word
And then you've got a lot to say,
But better use it carefully
Or it could change your life,

For example,
One night I said it to me girl,
And now me girl's my wife!
OW!
And a lovely thing she is too!

She's...
Supercalifragilisticexpailidocious!
Supercalifragilisticexpailidocious!
Supercalifragilisticexpailidocious!
Supercalifragilisticexpailidocious!
