Love, I get so lost sometimes
Days pass and this emptiness fills my heart
When I want to run away, I drive off in my car
But whichever way I go, I come back to the place you are


All my instincts, they return
And the grand façade, so soon will burn
Without a noise, without my pride
I reach out from the inside


In your eyes, the light, the heat
In your eyes I am complete
In your eyes I see the doorway
In your eyes to a thousand churches
In your eyes the resolution
In your eyes of all the fruitless searches
In your eyes
In your eyes Oh, I see the light and the heat
In your eyes, the light, the heat
In your eyes
Oh, I wanna be that complete
In your eyes, the light, the heat
In your eyes
I wanna touch the light, the heat I see in your eyes


Love, I don't like to see so much pain
So much wasted and this moment keeps slipping away
I get so tired of working so hard for our survival
I look to the time with you to keep me awake and alive


And all my instincts, they return
And the grand façade, so soon will burn
Without a noise, without my pride
I reach out from the inside


In your eyes your eyes, your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes the light, the heat
In your eyes I am complete
In your eyes I see the doorway
To a thousand churches
In your eyes the resolution
In your eyes of all the fruitless searches
Oh, I see the light and the heat
In your eyes
Oh, I wanna be that complete
In your eyes
I want to touch the light, the heat I see in your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes


Sa bet chi lamp, chi tangaay, sa bet maangi ci biir
Sa bet chi lamp, chi tangaay, sa bet maangi ci biir
Sa bet chi lamp, chi tangaay, sa bet maangi ci biir
Sa bet chi lamp, chi tangaay, sa bet maangi ci biir
Sa bet chi lamp, chi tangaay, sa bet maangi ci biir
