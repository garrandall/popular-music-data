Wide river
She opens her mouth to the sea
Singing dear, dear ocean, now
Here is a kiss from me

And she runs like a river to the setting sun
She runs like a river that has never been won
She runs like a river that will always be free

Wide river
Carry me back home
To the place I love
That I call my own

And we can run like a river to the setting sun
Run like a river that has never been won
Run like a river that will always be free

Wide river
Do you remember me
It was not so long ago
That you set me free

And now I run like a river to the setting sun
I run like a river that has never been won
I run like a river that will always be free

Come on baby
Let's run in circles
Come on darling let's circle each other
And find the love, all the love that we need

Come on baby, let's circle each other
Well, we can do, do for each other
I'll do for you, and you'll do for me

And we can run like a river to the setting sun
Run like a river that has never been won
Run like a river that will always be free

And we can run like a river to the setting sun
Run like a river that has never been won
Run like a river that will always be free

And we can run like a river to the setting sun
Run like a river that has never been won
Run like a river that will always be free
