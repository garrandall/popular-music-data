We came together in 1982
Through stormy weather, we sang the blues
You and me baby in a circle of fire

I've had my troubles, you had yours
We've had those feeling, but we've endured
You and me baby in a circle of fire

River of passion
River of love
You and me babe

It's a lovers moon and the stars are out
We're living stories that love writes about
And I'm caught in the heat of passion's womb
And I'm drawn in close like the tides to the moon

It's a lovers moon and the stars are out
We're living stories that love writes about
And I'm caught in the heat of passion's womb
And I'm drawn in close like the tides to the moon

The river is wide
The river is deep
The river is swift
But it's oh so sweet

You and me baby in a circle of fire
Just you and me baby in a circle of fire

Just you and me baby in a circle of fire
And I'm burnin'
Feel me burnin' in a circle of fire
