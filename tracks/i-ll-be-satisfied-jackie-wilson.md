Ooh, just a kiss, just a smile
Hold my hand, baby
Just once in awhile

That's all I need that's all I need
And I'll be satisfied

Think of me when you're away
Call me, darling
Just once a day

That's all I need, that's all I need
And I'll be satisfied

Oh, true love came to me when I met you
True love makes me know, I won't forget you
When you're around me, it makes me feel
Life is worth living, baby, love is so forgiving

Just a kiss, just a smile
Hold my hand, baby
Just once in awhile

That's all I need that's all I need
And I'll be satisfied

True love came to me when I met you
True love makes me know, I won't forget you
When you're around me, it makes me feel
Life is worth living, baby, love is so forgiving

Think of me when you're away
Call me, darling
Just once a day

That's all I need, that's all I need
And I'll be, no, no, no
That's all I need that's all I need
And I'll be, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's all I need that's all I need
And I'll be so satisfied

That's all I need that's all I need
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
That's all I need that's all I need
And I'll be, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's all I need that's all I need
