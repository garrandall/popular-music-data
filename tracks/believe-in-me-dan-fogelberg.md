If I could ever say it right
And reach your hostage heart
Despite the doubts you harbor then you might
Come to believe in me.

The life I lead is not the kind
That gives a woman peace of mind
I only hope someday you'll find
That you can believe in me.

Those other loves that came before
Mean nothing to me anymore
But you can never be quite sure
And will not believe in me.

Too many hearts have been broken
Failing to trust what they feel
But trust isn't something that's spoken
And love's never wrong when it's real.

If I could only do one thing
Then I would try to write and sing
A song that ends your questioning
And makes you believe in me.

Too many hearts have been broken
Failing to trust what they feel
But trust isn't something that's spoken
And love's never wrong when it's real.

If I could only do one thing
Then I would try to write and sing
A song that ends your questioning
And makes you believe in me
makes you believe in me.
Oh, you can believe in me.
