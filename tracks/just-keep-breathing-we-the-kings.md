When heaven seems so far away
And dreams are just a memory
Without the dark the light won't show
Remember that you're not alone
When you watch the world just turn away
And break the promises it made
When love is all too hard to hold
Just take a breath and let it go
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
Just keep breathing, breathing, breathing
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
Just keep breathing, breathing, breathing
2 A.M., too tired to sleep
When what you want's not what you need
And when these walls don't feel like home
Remember that you're not alone
The beginning's just another end
It's not too late to start again
When hope is all too hard to hold
Just take a breath and let it go
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
Just keep breathing, breathing, breathing
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
Just keep breathing, breathing, breathing
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
When heaven seems so far away
And dreams are just a memory
When love is all too hard to hold
Just take a breath and let it
And go whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
Just keep breathing, breathing, breathing
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
Just keep breathing, breathing, breathing
