I don't want half-hearted love affairs
I need someone who really cares
Life is too short to play silly games
I've promised myself I won't do that again

It's got to be perfect
It's got to be worth it, yeah
Too many people take second best
Well I won't take anything less
It's got to be, yeah, perfect

Young hearts are foolish, they make such mistakes
They're much too eager to give their love away
Well, I have been foolish too many times
Now I'm determined, I'm gonna get it right

It's got to be perfect
It's got to be worth it, yeah
Too many people take second best
Well I won't take anything less
It's got to be, yeah, perfect

Young hearts are foolish, they make such mistakes
They're much too eager to give their love away
Well, I have been foolish too many times
Now I'm determined, I'm gonna get it right

It's got to be perfect
It's got to be worth it, yeah
Too many people take second best
Well I won't take anything less
It's got to be, yeah, perfect

It's got to be, yeah, worth it
It's got to be perfect
