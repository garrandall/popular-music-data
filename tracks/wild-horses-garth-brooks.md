From a phone booth in Cheyenne 
I made a promise to Diane 
No more rodeos 
I'd gone my last go 'round 

The same promise that I made 
In San Antone and Santa Fe 
But tonight I saddled up 
And let her down 

Wild horses keep draggin' me away 
And I'll lose more than I'm gonna win someday 
Wild horses just stay wild 
And her heart is all I break 
Wild horses keep draggin' me away 

She'll watch me drive around her block 
Gettin' courage up to stop 
To make her one more promise 
That I can't keep 

The way I love the rodeo 
I guess I should let her go 
Before I hurt her more 
Than she loves me 

Wild horses keep draggin' me away 
And I'll lose more than I'm gonna win someday 
Wild horses just stay wild 
And her heart is all I break 
Wild horses keep draggin' me away
