Ooh la la, ooh la la, I cant, can't get over you

I remember the day, it was oh so sad
She was the sweetest dearest friend I ever had
She could talk to me almost anytime
And at the end of my day I felt fine
Her mother broke the news to my heart
She said they're leaving and now I'm torn all apart
I think I'll never forget that day
And for you girl this is all I have to say

Ooh la la, ooh la la, I cant, can't get over you

I had a dream, me myself and I
You were my girl and of course I was your guy
We were together forever in love for life
And now it don't seem so very nice
Forever to me was short but sweet
You never let me down, you kept me on my feet
Now today all I have to say
Take it out girl and try to find a way

Ooh la la, ooh la la, I cant, can't get over you
Log on to kill this message.

Believe it or not, I can't get over you
You are my everything, what a dream come true
What I feel for you is really hard to explain
I'm in love girl, I'll never feel the same
You and me can save our love
Well be together one day like hand in glove
All I have to say is I'll wait forever and a day

Ooh la la, ooh la la, I cant, can't get over you

Wait a minute, fellas, this has gotta be a dream
You know, I'm so used to seeing her every single day
My life will never be the same
I know it seems like we just met
And now she's leaving
I'll never find another girl like her
You think if we keep singing this song,
Shell hear it on the radio and come back?
Hey guys, I definitely think it's worth a try

Ooh la la, ooh la la, I cant, can't get over you
