Some will learn; many do.
Cover up or spread it out.
Turn around, had enough,
Pick and choose or pass it on.
Buying in, heading for
Suffer now or suffer then.
It's bad enough
I want the fear... need the fear


Cause he's alone (he has become)
He's alone (he has become)


Well if they're making it, making it
Then they're pushing it, pushing it
And they're leading us along
The hassle of all the screaming fits
That panic makes remorse

After all, what's the point?
Course levitation is possible.
If you're a fly; achieved and gone
Theres time for this and so much more.
It's typical - create a world
A special place of my design
To never cope or never care just use the key


Cause he's alone (he has become)
He's alone (he has become)



Over and Over a slave
Became
Over and Over a slave
Became
Over and Over a slave
Became
Over and Over a slave
Became
