Way on down to southern Alabama
With the guitars jamminâ
Thatâs where weâre headed
Straight up to Butte, Montana
Singinâ âLord, I Was Born a Ramblinâ Manâ
California to Oregon, even New York City
Got one or two hillbillies
Ready to hit the road


Itâs a brothers and a sisters kind of thang
Raise up your hands if you all wanna hang
With me and my gang
We live to ride, we ride to live
Me and my gang, jump on that train
Grab hold of them reigns
Weâre gonna rock this thang, cock this thang

Me and my gang, yeah â me and my gang

We got hippies, gypsies, freaks and geeks
High class women in Daisy Duke denim
Bangin on gongs and singing our songs
Dude named Elrock jamminâ on an iPod
Beer and bonfires
Wide open throttle
Coors in a bottle
Itâs all for one and one for all, yaâll


Me and my gang, yeah â Woo!
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na


Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na

Yeah â With me and my gang
Jump on that train â whoa!
Grab hold of them reigns, baby!
