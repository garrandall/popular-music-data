I get up in the morning and it's just another day
Pack up my belongings, I've got to get away
Jump into a taxi and the time is gettin' tight
I got to keep on movin' I got a show tonight

And I'm movin' on, movin' on from town to town
Movin' on, baby, never seem to touch the ground

I check in to the ticket desk I have an hour to go
Headin' for the boarding gate I'm feelin' pretty low
Fifteen minutes later I'm sittin' on my plane
Fastening my safety belt I'm takin' off again

And I'm movin' on, movin' on from town to town
Moving on, baby, yeah I'm never touching the ground

Movin' on, movin' on from town to town
Movin' on, I can't seem to stop now

Movin'
Movin' on

I got to move on, move on from town to town
I got to move on
And I never seem to slow me down

I'm movin' on, movin' on from town to town

I never seem to slow down

Everyday of my life I'm moving on
