You're a very pretty girl and all that's good
A lot of guys would love you if they could
When you add up all the hugs and every little kiss
Get down to the bottom line and try to answer this

I wanna know, are you happy?
Tell me, tell me, do you know how it feels
To have someone to love you for real?

Oh, you're a hip young man trying to make it in the world
Messing up the minds of a lot of little girls
Brother, you got to face one fact
The heartache you give out, you're gonna get it all back

So, are you happy?
Tell me, tell me, do you know how it feels?
Oh, are you really happy for real?

This is one thing you gotta learn
You'll never get love until you give it in return

Are you happy?
Hey, tell me, tell me, baby, do you know how it feels?
I wanna know, do you have somebody to love you for real?

Hey, did you hear what I say?
Are you really happy?
Tell me, tell me, tell me, do you know how it feels?

Oh, are you happy?
