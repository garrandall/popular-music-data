I know you love me
You know I love you too
You know I always will
No matter what you do

You say you haven't got another lover
You say you only want to make the scene
Then you try to keep it under cover
What does that mean?

And baby, I can't stand still (while he's holding you)
I can't stand (while he's kissing you)

So we got a little problem, baby:
How to put together love and work
If I could figure out that one, darlin'
I could save us from a world of hurt

I remember when we walked together
Makin' love on a summer night
Guess we thought that it would last forever
We were all right

But baby, I can't stand still (while he's holding you)
I can't stand still (while he's touching you)
Baby

I can take it if you need some freedom
Understand it if you miss your friends
Don't you ever try to think of me some
You never tell me where you've been

You say you haven't got another lover
You say you only want to make the scene
Then you try to keep it under cover
What does that mean?

And baby, I can't stand still (while he's holding you)
I can't stand still (while he's kissing you)
And baby, I can't stand still (while he's holding you)
I can't stand still (while he's touching you)
Baby, I can't stand still (while he=s holding you)
I can't stand still (while he's kissing you)
And baby, I can't stand still (while he's holding you)
I can't stand still (while he's touching you)
