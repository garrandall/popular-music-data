Stand or fall
The love you have
Is all you have to give
As long as you live
On your own
You're never all alone

There'll be a light to guide you on
Remember that love is there

(Stand your ground)
(Stand your ground)
You made it this far, baby
Don't let it go
(Stand your ground)
(Stand your ground)
This is the moment for you know, oh

(I'll be there)
(To hold you in my heart)
'Cause our love lasts forever
(I'll be there)
I'll never let us drift apart
I'll be there for you

Comes a day
Feels so feels away
So far to go
You should know by now

(I'll see you)
You're free
(I know)
How we used to be
(To be the one)

You've got the power
Do whatever you desire
You're gonna bet to win
You're a survivor

(Stand your ground)
Whoa, oh, oh
(Stand your ground)
I swear wherever you have to go
Darlin' know

(I'll be there)
(To hold you in my heart)
'Cause our love lasts forever
(I'll be there)
I'll never let us drift apart
I'll be there for you

(I'll be there)
(No need to feel alone)
(When your love lasts forever)
(I'll be there)
My heart is gonna be at home

(You gotta love)
(You gotta love)
(You gotta know you got my love)
Whoa, oh, oh

(You gotta love)
(You gotta love)
(You gotta know you got my love)
Oh, my love

(You gotta love)
(You gotta love)
(You gotta know you got my love)
Wooo, oh

(I'll be there)
(To hold you in my heart)
'Cause our love lasts forever
(I'll be there)
Oh, I'll never let us drift apart
(I'll be there for you)

(I'll be there)
(No need to feel alone)
'Cause our love lasts forever
(I'll be there)
My heart is gonna be at home
(I'll be there for you)

(You gotta love)
(You gotta love)
(You gotta love)
Woo hoo
Whoa, oh, oh

(I'll be there)
(To hold you in my heart)
'Cause our love lasts forever
(I'll be there)
I'll never let us drift apart
(I'll be there for you)

(You gotta love)
(You gotta love)
(You gotta love)
Woo hoo
Whoa, oh, oh
