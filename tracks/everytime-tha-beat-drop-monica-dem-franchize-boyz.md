R-R-R-Rock then bend my knees, every time the beat drop


I can't help who I'm is when they play my shhh
I just love to dance every time the beat drop
I love to wild out damn right shake it all night
Ay that's my jam every time the beat drop
I said oh all the ladies in the club grab a dude
And you work it real slow you can do it
Move it till you make him lose it
(r-r-r-rock then bend your knees every time the beat drop)
He gon' be a fan every time the beat drop


I know you used to seeing Mo laid back
So for the most part you think I'm like that (dig this)
You about to get a glimpse of the fit
I'm getting niggas on the floor mane when I hit the door mane
Cause I ain't one of these too bourgeois broads
Always in the club holding up the wall (now dig this)
You about to get a taste of the way that we do it down here in the A
Let me say


I can't help who I'm is when they play my shhh
I just love to dance every time the beat drop
I love to wild out damn right shake it all night
Ay that's my jam every time the beat drop
I said oh all the ladies in the club grab a dude
And you work it real slow you can do it
Move it till you make him lose it
(r-r-r-rock then bend your knees every time the beat drop)
He gon' be a fan every time the beat drop


Now I ain't talking bout a little two step
I'm talking bout something that'll make you sweat
And when I talk well I'm through talking
I'm about to do something move something let you see something
When I say get gutta it's enough said
Do the bounce like you over on Bankhead
And if anybody got a problem with the way you doin you
Look 'em dead in the face and say


I can't help who I'm is when they play my shhh
I just love to dance every time the beat drop
I love to wild out damn right shake it all night
Ay that's my jam every time the beat drop
I say oh all the ladies in the club grab a dude
And you work it real slow you can do it
Move it till you make him lose it
(r-r-r-rock then bend your knees every time the beat drop)
He gon' be a fan every time the beat drop


You know pimpin' make the beat drop fuckin' wit a laptop
I make 'em do it do it as soon as the beat drop
Might throw my towels out like Nick I like to wild out
I'm a stay in the game until I fall out
First I lean grab a ball and then I pop wit it (I pop wit it)
When they bring the mics the crowd I rock wit it (I rock wit it)
I never hind licks trying to get quick
When the songs on they like that's my shit


I can't help who I'm is when they play my shhh
I just love to dance every time the beat drop
I love to wild out damn right shake it all night
Ay that's my jam every time the beat drop
I say oh all the ladies in the club grab a dude
And you work it real slow you can do it
Move it till you make him lose it
(r-r-r-rock then bend your knees every time the beat drop)
He gon' be a fan every time the beat drop

I can't help who I'm is when they play my shhh
I just love to dance every time the beat drop
I love to wild out damn right shake it all night
Ay that's my jam every time the beat drop
I say oh all the ladies in the club grab a dude
And you work it real slow you can do it
Move it till you make him lose it
(r-r-r-rock then bend your knees every time the beat drop)
He gon' be a fan every time the beat drop
