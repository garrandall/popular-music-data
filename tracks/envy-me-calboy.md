Now I lay me down to sleep, ayy
I pray the Lord my soul to keep, yeah, ayy
Like a locksmith, I got the keys, yeah, ayy
Pull up, make opp niggas bleed, yeah, ayy
I got water like overseas, yeah, ayy
Bitch, I ball like NBA, yeah, ayy
Bitch, I ball like MVP's, yeah, ayy
I got money, they envy me

I'm with the gang, I'm with the mob, what was you thinking?
Remember them days, and that shit was hard, a nigga been thinking
I put a four in a twenty ounce, a nigga been drinking, yeah
If you with the squad, I give you my heart, lil' nigga, I mean it
I was fighting some demons, in the field, bitch, I'm deep in
I was raised in the deep end, I know niggas be sinking
Take your bitch and go deep in, but I gave her back, why you tweaking?
Come around with that rah-rah, we leave you dead on the cement
With the gang, we ain't playing fair
Matter fact, we don't play at all
OG 'Woods in the air
But we bought the Runtz so we smoke it all
Putting on a front, boy, you better fall
We gone kill 'em dead, we gone kill 'em all
Might spend a ten when I'm in the mall
I was on the bend with it in my drawers
Hit that smoke and I'm blacking
Hit that smoke and I black out
If he run, blow his back down
I was gone but I'm back now
These niggas gone fold, but I never back down
In the school, I was trapping
In the school, you was class clown

Ayy, now I lay me down to sleep, ayy
I pray the Lord my soul to keep, yeah, ayy
Like a locksmith, I got the keys, yeah, ayy
Pull up, make opp niggas bleed, yeah, ayy
I got water like overseas, yeah, ayy
Bitch, I ball like NBA, yeah, ayy
Bitch, I ball like MVP's, yeah, ayy
I got money, they envy me
