Why can't it stay like this forever?
Why does it always have to change?

Everytime you think you've paid the price,
Seems you've always got to pay it twice.
Everytime you think you're near the end,
You turn around and find another ticket.

Oh my love, time is running out.
Oh my love, time is running out.

Why must we wait until tomorrow,
When we already know the score?

Everytime you think you've paid the price,
Seems you've always got to pay it twice.
Everytime you think you've got it made,
Seems you're only lying in the shade.

Everytime you think you've run the course,
Seems you've got to ride another horse.
Everytime you think you're near the end,
You turn around and find another ticket.
