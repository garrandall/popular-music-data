Party, party
Let's party
Oh, Lord now, party
Party, party, party
Let me party with you
Oh, baby
Party, party, party
Let me party with you
Come on
Party, party, party
Let me party with you
Party, party, party
Let me party with you
I know I didn't come here rich
But I sure love trying to get through
Hey, little girl
Lay your love on me
I know what I'm trying to do
I'm trying to get it on with you
Oh wee, baby, I'd like
To sweet confession with you
Come, on baby
Just party, party, party
Let me party with you
You can do it
Party, party, party
Let me party with you
Lay it on, my baby
Party, party, party
Let me party with you
Party, party, party
Let me party with you
Oh, oh..
