Sometimes I wonder if I'm still alive
How much abuse can someone stand and survive
How long I've waited for the day to arrive
When I won't be a fool no more


Nobody knows how you push me around
Nobody sees how you treat me like I'm your clown
I never made a sound


It's the very last time
You will get on my case
It's the very last time
'Cause I won't be a fool no more
It's the very last time
You will step on my face
It's the very last time
'Cause I won't be a fool no more


I still remember the look in your eyes
Just a reflection of the things you despise
But sooner or later, I've got to get wise
And I won't be a fool no more


Nobody sees how you treat me like dirt
Nobody knows just how badly a man can hurt
You've got a lesson to learn
Yeah, yeah, yeah


It's the very last time
You will get on my case
It's the very last time
'Cause I won't be a fool no more
It's the very last time
You will step on my face
It's the very last time
'Cause I won't be a fool no more


I can still feel the sting of your words
I won't cry no matter how much it hurts
My head may go crazy, my heart it may burst
But I won't be a fool no more
No, I won't be a fool no more


It's the very last time
You will get on my case
It's the very last time
'Cause I won't be a fool no more
It's the very last time
You will step on my face
It's the very last time
'Cause I won't be a fool no more
