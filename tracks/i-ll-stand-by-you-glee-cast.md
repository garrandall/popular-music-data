I saw her today at a reception 
A glass of wine in her hand 
I knew she would meet her connection 
At her feet was her footloose man 

No, you can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
And if you try sometime you find 
You get what you need 

I saw her today at the reception 
A glass of wine in her hand 
I knew she was gonna meet her connection 
At her feet was her footloose man 

You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
But if you try sometimes you might find 
You get what you need 

Oh yeah, hey hey hey, oh... 

And I went down to the demonstration 
To get my fair share of abuse 
Singing, "We're gonna vent our frustration 
If we don't we're gonna blow a 50-amp fuse" 
Sing it to me now... 

You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
But if you try sometimes well you just might find 
You get what you need 
Oh baby, yeah, yeah! 

I went down to the Chelsea drugstore 
To get your prescription filled 
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy 
And man, did he look pretty ill 
We decided that we would have a soda 
My favorite flavor, cherry red 
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy 
Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was "dead" 
I said to him 

You can't always get what you want, no! 
You can't always get what you want (tell ya baby) 
You can't always get what you want (no) 
But if you try sometimes you just might find 
You get what you need 
Oh yes! Woo! 

You get what you need--yeah, oh baby! 
Oh yeah! 

I saw her today at the reception 
In her glass was a bleeding man 
She was practiced at the art of deception 
Well I could tell by her blood-stained hands 

You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
But if you try sometimes you just might find 
You just might find 
You get what you need
