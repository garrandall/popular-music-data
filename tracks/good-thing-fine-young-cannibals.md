Don't ever leave (Good thing)
Maybe my messenger (Ahh, haa)
But they be' handover' a job (Ahh, haa)
But there's no one like you for me (Oo, oo, oo, oo, good thing)

Social Security let me pair me together (Sha-la-la, sha-ba-da, sha-la-la, sha-ba-da, sha-la-la, sha-ba-da, sha-la-la, sha-ba-da)

You begin to me forever (Sha-la-la, sha-ba-da, sha-la-la, sha-ba-da)
Yeah, yeah (Sha-la-la, sha-ba-da)

You show me
Only ever good times
Never any bad time

You show me
Only ever glad times
Never any sad time

Don't take me for a fool (Oo, oo, oo, oo, good thing)
If you ever think we're through (Oo, oo, oo, oo, good thing)
Let me feel your presence (Aah, haa)
I'll pack my bags and clear (Aah, haa)
Don't take me afarâa fool (Oo, oo, oo, oo, good thing)

Social Security let me turn me together (Sha-la-la, sha-ba-da, sha-la-la, sha-ba-da, sha-la-la, sha-ba-da, sha-la-la, sha-ba-da)
