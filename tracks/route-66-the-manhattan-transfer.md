If you ever
Plan to motor west
Travel my way, take the highway that's the best
Get your kicks on Route 66

It winds from Chicago to LA
More than two thousand miles all the way
Baby, get your kicks on Route 66

Now you go through St. Louie
Joplin, Missouri
And Oklahoma City looks mighty pretty
You'll see Amarillo
Gallup, New Mexico
Flagstaff Arizona
Don't forget Winona
Kingman, Barstow, San Bernadino

Won't you get hip to this timely tip
When you make that California trip
Get your kicks on Route 66

Now you go through St. Louie
Joplin, Missouri
And Oklahoma City looks mighty pretty
Now you'll see Amarillo
Gallup, New Mexico
Flagstaff Arizona
Don't forget Winona
Kingman, Barstow, San Bernadino

Won't you get hip to this timely tip
When you make that California trip
Get your kicks on Route 66

Get your kicks on Route six six
Get your kicks on Route 66
Get your kicks on Route six six
