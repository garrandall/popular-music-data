Do believe I'm gonna clap my hands, think I might tap my feet.
Put together a one-man band, take a walk on down the street.
Have a one-man parade, nobody needs to know.
Cause I'm right good of holding on to secrets and don't believe they show.

All I want is a little dog to be walking at my right hand.
Taking a breeze just as free as you please, maybe checking out occasional garbage cans.
Talking bout a one dog, y'all, nobody's friend but mine.
Hey now, you can say he's looking kind of funky, but I do believe he suits me just fine.

We were on the road again, I was wondering what to do,
but Honalei, it was pouring down rain, baby she had the low down blues.

Hey now, I was looking for my walking cane tying on my highway shoes.
Thinking 'bout a one man parade, y'all, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, hey.
I'm right good at holding on, holding on, holding on.

Honalei, it's raining. Honalei, sure nough, it's raining, listen here.
Honalei, it's raining, Honalei, it's raining muddy waters.

Thinking 'bout a one man parade, y'all, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, hey.
I'm right good at holding on, holding on, holding on.
La la la la la
