I was shopping for a suit the other day
And walked into the department store
I stepped on the elevator and told the girl
"Dry goods floor"

When I got off I saw a salesman was coming to me
He said "Now, what can I do for you"
I said "Well go in there and show me all the sport's clothes
Like you're supposed to"

He said, "Well, sure, come on in buddy
Dig these fabrics we got laid out on the shelf"
He said "Pick yourself out one
Try it on, stand in the mirror and dig yourself"

Oh... That suit's pure herringbone
Oh... Yeah, that's a suit I'd like to own
Oh... Buddy, that suit is you
Oh... Yeah, I believe it too

I see for the business man you feature the natural shoulder
That retail, wholesale indeed
It's got the custom cuffs and the walking short
He said "And I'm gonna let you have at a steal"

And for the playboy you have the latest in tweed

With the cut-away flap over twice
It's a box-back, two button western model
He said, "Now ain't that nice"

Oh... Them buttons are solid gold
Oh... You made a deal, sold
Oh... That collar's pure camel hair
Oh... Well, you can just set it down right in that chair

Now you go back there and you get that paper and let me sign on the dotted line
And I'll make sure I get all my payments in right on time
Hey wait a minute buddy, let me go back there and do a little checking on you
Then the man come back, he said "I'm sorry my man but your credit didn't go through"
Why, what you mean

Oh... Ain't this a shame
Oh... My heart's in pain
Oh... Pure, pure herringbone
Oh... That's a suit you'll never own
Oh, Lord have mercy
