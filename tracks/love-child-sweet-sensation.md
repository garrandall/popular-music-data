You think that I don't feel love
But what I feel for you is real love
In other's eyes I see reflected, a hurt, scorn, rejected...

Love child, never meant to be
Love child, born in poverty
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, take a look at me

Started my life, in an old, cold, run down tenement slum
My father left, he never even married mom
Or shared the gift my momma knew
So afraid that others knew I had no name
This love we're contemplating
Isn't worth the pain of waiting
We'll only end up hating the child, we may be creating

Love child, never meant to be
Love child, society
Love child, always second best
Love child, different from the rest

Started school, in a worn, torn dress that somebody threw out
I knew the way it felt to always live in doubt
To be without the simple things
So afraid my friends could see the guilt in me
Don't think that I don't need ya
Don't think that I don't want to please ya
But no child of mine will be bearing, the name of shame I be wearing

Love child, never meant to be
Love child, born in poverty
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, take a look at me

Love child, never meant to be
Love child, society
Love child, always second best
Love child, different from the rest

Love child, never quite as good
Afraid, ashamed, misunderstood
I will always love you, I will always love you
...
