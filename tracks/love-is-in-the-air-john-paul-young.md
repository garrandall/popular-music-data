Love is in the air
Everywhere I look around
Love is in the air
Every sight and every sound

And I don't know if I'm being foolish
Don't know if I'm being wise
But it's something that I must believe in
And it's there when I look in your eyes


Love is in the air
In the whisper of the trees
Love is in the air
In the thunder of the sea

And I don't know if I'm just dreaming
Don't know if I feel sane
But it's something that I must believe in
And it's there when you call out my name


Love is in the air
Love is in the air
Oh-oh-oh
Mm-oh oohhoh


Love is in the air
In the risin' of the sun
Love is in the air
When the day is nearly done

And I don't know if you're an illusion
Don't know if I see it true
But you're something that I must believe in
And you're there when I reach out for you


Love is in the air
Everywhere I look around
Love is in the air
Every sight and every sound

And I don't know if I'm being foolish
Don't know if I'm being wise
But it's something that I must believe in
And it's there when I look in your eyes


Love is in the air
Love is in the air
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh


Oh, love is in the air
Love is in the air
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-ohoohhoh
