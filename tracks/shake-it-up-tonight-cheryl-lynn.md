I can't wait until the sun goes down
I'm gettin' ready
See the moonlight on the town
I'm gettin' ready

I'm gonna put on my steppin' shoes
'Cause I'm gettin' ready
Walk the streets and spread the news
I'm gettin' ready

I'm gonna call you on the telephone
Gonna tell somebody there's a party goin' on

Shake it up tonight
Show you how to party right
Shake it up tonight
Show you how to party right

Gonna be a lot of people there
Don't you wanna be ready
There'll be coming from everywhere
I'm gettin' ready

Don't you know I wanna be with you tonight?
Come on, baby, 'cause we're gonna do it right
I'm gettin' ready

Just put the pillow rhythm in your heart
Just put your hands together when the music starts

Shake it up tonight
Show you how to party right
Shake it up tonight
Move your body left and right

Shake it up tonight
Show you how to party right
Shake it up tonight
Dance the night away

Shakin' my body up and down tonight
Said the time is right
Oh, I'm gonna shake my body tonight
And move my hips from left to right
I'm gonna shake my body tonight
I wanna shake it down now

I can't wait until the sun goes down
I'm gettin' ready
See the moonlight on the town
I'm gettin' ready

I'm gonna put on my steppin' shoes
'Cause I, I wanna be ready
Walk the streets and spread the news
There's a party

Call my friends on the telephone
Let's all get together and we'll get off
Now let's party

Shake it up tonight
Show you how to do it right
Shake it up tonight
Show you how to party right

I wanna show you how to party right
I wanna show you how to get down tonight
I wanna show you how to have some fun
I wanna show you how it can be done

Shake it, shake it up tonight
Show you how to party right
Shake it up tonight
Show you how to party right

Shake it, shake it up tonight
Show you how to party right
Shake it, shake it up tonight
Show you how to party right
Shake it, shake it up tonight
Show you how to party right

Shake it, shake it up tonight
Show you how to party right
Shake it, shake it up tonight
Show you how to party right
