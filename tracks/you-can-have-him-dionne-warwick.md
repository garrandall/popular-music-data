Well, you can have him, I don't want him,
He didn't love me anyway.
He only wanted someone to play with
But all I wanted was love to stay.

Well, you get stuck with the wrong man
There's only one thing that you can do:
Just dig a hole and jump right in it,
And pull the ground right over you.

Well, you can have him I don't want him I don't
Want him,
He didn't love me anyway anyway.
He only wanted someone to play with
But all I wanted was love to stay.

The boy I love, he, up and left me,
He ran away with my best friend.
Comes home at night just for an hour
When day light comes he's gone again.

Life without love is mighty empty,
But confessions good for the soul.
I'd rather have love that I can cling to
Than have the world and all of it's gold.

You can have him, I don't want
Him,
He didn't love me, anyway.
He only wanted some one to
Play with
Ohhhhhhhh! 
Was love to stay 
Ohhhhhhhhh!

You can have him
IIIIIIIIII don't want him
He didn't love me anyway anyway
He only wanted someone to play with someone to play
With
But all I want
All I want
All I want
All I want
