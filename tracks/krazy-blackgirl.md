You're making me krazy
Krazy, krazy for you, krazy
Krazy, krazy for you, krazy

Boy, you're making me
Boy, you're making me
Boy, you're making me crazy

I remember when I saw your face
For the first time, babe
You blew my mind
And when you stared at me

You turn me on

And now you got me going krazy
(You're making me krazy)
You got me
(You're making me krazy for you)

Oh, you got me krazy for you
(You're making me krazy)
You got me going out of my mind
(You're making me krazy for you)
Oh, you're making me

The way you're
Making sweet love to me
It's all right, cause you make
Me feel, oh, so good inside

I never knew that
I could feel this way
The way you turn me on
And now you got me going crazy

(You're making me krazy)
(You're making me krazy for you)
Oh, you got me krazy for you
(You're making me krazy)
I never knew that I could feel this way
(You're making me krazy for you)

Oh, you're making me krazy
(You're making me krazy)
(You're making me krazy for you)
Boy, you know you got me
Going out of my mind

(You're making me crazy)
Oh, oh
(You're making me crazy for you)
I don't know what I'm gonna do, baby

Krazy

Boy, you're driving me out of mind
And you know that you're
Making me krazy for you

Ain't no doubt about the way I feel
There's no doubt about it
The way that you're making me feel
It's true, uh uh uh

Baby, you know you got me going
(You're making me crazy) crazy
(You're making me crazy for you)

You know you got me going
(You're making me crazy)
You're making me crazy
(You're making me crazy for you)
Come on, come on, come on, baby

(You're making me crazy)
You got me going out of my mind
(You're making me crazy for you)
