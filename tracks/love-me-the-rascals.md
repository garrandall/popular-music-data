(Please) love me
(Please) mm now, love me

Everywhere I turn I find
You are always on my mind
Everything I seem to say
Ends up in the same old way

(Please) oh now, love me
(Please) I want you to love me

What I feel, I can't explain
What is spring without the rain?
Missing that would be shame
Only you are left to blame
Oh, no

All I know is yours if you would take it
Make believe it's ours and we can make it
Now give a little, understand
Reach out for a lonely hand
'Cause this could be our only chance
Oh

(Please) mm now, love me
(Please) please, please love me

Give me all you have to share
Without you I couldn't care
Make me happy when I'm down
When I'm gone, don't play around
Ah

Oh
(Please) mm now, love me
(Please) please love me

Everywhere I turn I find
You are always on my mind
Everything I seem to say
Ends up in the same old way

(Please) mm-hmm, love me
(Please) darling, love me

What I feel, I can't explain
What is spring without the rain?
Missing that would be shame
Only you are left to blame

Sure to blame, yeah
Do you understand?
