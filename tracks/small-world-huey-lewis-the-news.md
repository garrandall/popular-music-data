All around the world
There are people like you and me
From the poorest beggar in the street
To the richest king and queen

Some people take
And then they never give
You gotta learn to give and take
If yo wanna learn to live
In a small world
Small, small world

Now we can
Fight one another
Like they to on T.V.
Or we can
Help one another
The way it's supposed to be

If we all give a little
It could really mean a lot
It's a small world
But it's the only one we've got
Small world
Small, small world
