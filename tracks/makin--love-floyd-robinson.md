What would people say?
What would people do?
What would people think
If people knew I was with you?
Makin' lo-ove, makin' love
Makin' lo-ove, makin' love
What would people think?
What if people knew?
Instead of bein' off to school
All day I was with you
Makin' lo-ove, makin' love
Makin' lo-ove, makin' love
I don't care what they think
I don't care what they do
Don't care what they care about
All I ever care about is you
Makin' lo-ove, makin' love
Makin' lo-ove, makin' love
Would people start to talk?
Would people start to frown?
If people knew the things we say
Would envy over town
Makin' lo-ove, makin' love
Makin' lo-ove, makin' love
What would the teacher do?
What would the teacher say?
What would the teacher do
If the teacher knew, we's out all day
Makin' lo-ove, makin' love
Makin' lo-ove, makin' love
I don't care what they think
Don't care what they do
I don't care what they care about
All I ever care about is you
Makin' lo-ove, makin' love
Makin' lo-ove, makin' love
Makin' lo-ove, makin' love
