Don't tell me your troubles I got troubles of my own
Don't tell me your troubles just leave me alone
Leave me alone go on home tell it to a friend I got troubles of my own
Say your sweet love left ye what you think about me
Got them same old heartaches same old miseries
Leave me alone go on home tell it to a friend I got troubles of my own
Happens to the best of us that's what they always say
Take it boy like a man I don't stand in my way
You tell that she's not good she's mean as she can be
It's written all over your lonesome face any heartbroken fool can see
Leave me alone go on home tell it to a friend I got troubles of my own
Troubles of my own

Well it happens to the best...
