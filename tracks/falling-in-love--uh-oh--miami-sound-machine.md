Doctor
I've got this feeling
Deep inside of me
Deep inside of me
Ijust can't control my feet
When I hear the beat
When I hear the beat
Hey doctor
Could you give me something
To ease the pain
To ease the pain
'Cause if you don't help me soon
I'm gonna lose my brain
Gonna go insane
Ijust don't know
Don't know
How I'm gonna deal with you
