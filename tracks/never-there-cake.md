I need your arms around me
I need to feel your touch
I need your understanding, I need your love
So much

You tell me that you love me so
You tell me that you care
But when I need you, (Baby!)
Baby, (You're never there)

On the phone
Long long distance
Always through such
Strong resistance

When first you say
You're too busy
I wonder if you
Even miss me

Never there
You're never there
You're never, ever
Ever ever there

(Hey!)

A golden bird that flies away
A candle's fickle flame
To think I held you yesterday
Your love was just a game

A golden bird that flies away
A candle's fickle flame
To think I held you yesterday
Your love was just a game

You tell me that you love me so
You tell me that you care
But when I need you, (BABY)
Baby

Take the time
To get to know me
If you want me
Why can't you just show me

We're always on
This roller coaster
If you want me
Why can't you get closer

Never there
You're never there
You're never, ever
Ever ever there

Never there
You're never there
You're never, ever
Ever ever there
