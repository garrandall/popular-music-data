When I see you in the morning with the sleep still in your eyes
I remember all the laughter and the tears we shared last night
And as we lie here, just two shadows in the light before the dawn
The sweetest thing I've ever known is loving you

And I have never been afraid of losing now
And I have never wanted love to be a chain
I only know that when I'm with you, you're my sunshine, you're my rain
The sweetest thing I've ever known is loving you
The sweetest thing I've ever known is loving you

Now, you and I, we're not children
We have both been loved before
We have given and we have taken many rides on troubled shores
But all the heartaches and temptations only make me love you more
The sweetest thing I've ever known is loving you

And I have never been afraid of losing now
And I have never wanted love to be a chain
I only know that when I'm with you, you're my sunshine, you're my rain
The sweetest thing I've ever known is loving you
The sweetest thing I've ever known is loving you
