Stuck it on a slab of ash
Sold one to Luther, threw in a pick
Sent him out with Johnny Cash
Now, could Leo Fender and the gang have known
At the factory in Fullerton?
That the honky twang of the Telecaster tone
Would outlast 'em, every one


It's got a plush-lined case
It's all up in your face
It's your thunderin' lightning rod -
It was born at the junction of form and function -
It's the hammer of the honky-tonk gods
It's the hammer of the honky-tonk gods!


You got Buck and Don, Merle and Roy
Muddy and the Iceman, too
Bryant, Bert, Roy, Danny, and Redd
Why, that's Redd with two 'D's to you
Well, there's Waylon and Keith
'Bout off th' top of my head
Chrissie, Cropper and the Boss
Why, if Johnny B Goode had one, he would
Up in the St. Louis Telecaster, hoss


You've (She's) got your (a) plush-lined case
An' all (All) up in your face
She's your (ya) thunderin' lightning rod -
(Well it was) Born at the junction of form and function -
It's the ('e) hammer of the honky-tonk gods
It's the hammer of the honky-tonk gods!


Stuck it on a slab of ash
Sold one to Luther, threw in a pick
