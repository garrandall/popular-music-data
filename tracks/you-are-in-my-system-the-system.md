Day by day
And night by night
I see you in my mind
It happens all the time
You know my daydreams stop
My heart beats on
I can't take it anymore
It's you I live for

Oh baby
You are in my system
I just want you to know that
Oh
You're in my system
Got me burnin' burnin' baby, oh
You are in my system
Oh
You are in my system, system
Don't you, don't you know that baby?

I will keep on pushing, pushing
Until I get through
My main objective baby
Is to get to you

To turn your mind around
I know will take time
But you know I can't wait, no
You're on my mind

Oh baby
You are in my system
I just want you to know that
Oh
You're in my system
Got me burnin' burnin' baby
You are in my system
Oh
You are in my system, system
I keep on pushin' baby

You're in my soul
Love's got control
Just can't get enough
Of your loving touch

It's a romantic vision of me and you
Holding hands on Sunday
And Monday too
There's no doubt in my mind
That I'll be true baby
You know I'll take you out and I'll keep love new
Oh baby

You are in my system
I just want you to know that
Oh
You're in my system
Got me burnin' I'm on fire baby
You are in my system
Oh
You are in my system, system
Got me burnin' oh baby
