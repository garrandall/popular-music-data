Winchester

Hey girl say hey say what
What you say
Hey girl say hey say what
The latest news is somewhat depressing
The latest figures are a little bit distressing
So what you say girl
We let it slide for a day darling
What you say
I get the word from Authur my broker
He says Sell it all, son and stick to poker
So what you say girl we let it slide for a day darling
Now what you say?
What's the big rush
What's the big hurry
We've all the time in the world
For the worry
We'll tell the world that we'll meet em on Sunday
Then we don't show up until Monday
Hey girl say hey say what
What you say?
Hey girl say hey say what
Now I don't sweat it that much as a rule
But lately it's been rough keeping cool
Say what you say we let it slide for a day
Darling what you say?
What's the big rush
What's the big hurry
We've all the time in the world
For the worry
We'll tell the world that we'll meet em on Sunday
Then we don't show up until Monday
The daily grind is getting me frantic
I see myself as a laid back romantic
So, oh, what you say if
We just let it slide for a day girl
What you say?
Hey girl say hey say what
What you say?
Hey girl say hey say what
What you say?
Hey girl say hey say what
What you say?
Now darling
Listen girl you tell me what you say
Darling oh tell me what you say
Lover won't you tell me what you say?
