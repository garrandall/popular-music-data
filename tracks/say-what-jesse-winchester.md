Well, he knew what he was doin'
When he put eyes into my head
If he didn't want me to lookin' at them pretty little women
He'd'a left my ol' eyeballs dead

Isn't that so
Tell me, isn't that so
You got to go when your heart says go
Isn't that so

Well, he knew what he was doin'
When he made that magic vine
His own son got a reputation
For turnin' water into wine

Isn't that so
Tell me, isn't that so
You got to go when your heart says go
Isn't that so

Let that line of least resistance lead me on
Let the line of least resistance lead me on

Well, he know what he was doin'
When he divided the high from the low
You got to bury seed in the womb, my friend
If you want the little seed to grow

Now, isn't that so
Isn't that so
You got to go when your heart says go
Isn't that so

You got to go when your heart says go
Isn't that so
Let that line of least resistance lead me on
Let the line of least resistance lead me on
Let your heart, let your heart, your heart lead you on
Let your heart, let your heart lead you on
