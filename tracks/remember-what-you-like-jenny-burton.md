Yes, I do
And I do
Yes, I do
And I do

(CHORUS)
I remember what you like
(Never give up
I'll never give up)
I remember what you like
(Never give up
I'll never give up)

I remember what you like
(Never give up
I'll never give up)
I remember what you like
(Never give up
I'll never give up)

If I had a minute for you
I would make it last for hours
Just because I know what to do
Don't mean I have some secret powers

I just like to use what's mine
And I have a way with time

I remember what you like
(Never give up
I'll never give up)
I remember what you like
(Never give up
I'll never give up)

I remember what you like

I remember how you cried
I remember all that hurt you
When you showed your softer side
You thought I would desert you

But I know what makes you smile
I can make it worth your while

I remember what you like
(Never give up
I'll never give up)
I remember what you like
(Never give up
I'll never give up)

When night become so real
It can make you pray for hours
You put your tight pants on
Pretend to have some power

You endlessly dance through the night
Wound up
Oh, so tight

I know just what you like
(Never give up
I'll never give up)
I remember what you like
(Never give up
I'll never give up)

I remember what you like
(Never give up
I'll never give up)
I remember what you like, you like
You like, you like, you like
You like, you like, you like
You like, you like, you like

That's right
That's right
That's right, right, right

(Never give up
I'll never give up)
(I, I never give up)
(Never give up
I'll never give up)
(I, I never give up)

I just like to use what's mine
And I have a way with time
I remember what you like
I have a way with time
I remember what you like

(Never give up
I'll never give up)
I remember what you like
(Never give up
I'll never give up)
I remember
