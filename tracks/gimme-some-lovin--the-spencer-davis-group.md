C'mon baby, won't you stay - gimme love in every way
Things I feel, gotta say, keep us talkin', talkin' everyday
I got so many reasons
It would take a year and twenty days

Goin' out to buy some gin - it ain't right, the mood you're in
Lights down low, sounds from low, work it out but not too, not too slow
'Cause things are happening to me babe
Make some fun and make it your way

C'mon baby, won't you feed me - don't you leave me, give me lovin' everyday
Things I feel, gotta say, keep us talkin', talkin' everyday
We've got so many reasons
While others make this way

C'mon baby, won't you stay - gimme love in every way
Things I feel, gotta say, keep us talkin' everyday
We got so many reasons
It would take a year and twenty days

C'mon babe
C'mon babe
