Oh! (Millitainment)
Oh! (Millitainment)
Oh! (Millitainment)
Come on (Millitainment)
Oh! (Millitainment)
This one is the hot one! (Millitainment)
Aiyyo! (Millitainment)


Homeboy, I came to party (oh!)
Yo' girl was lookin at me (oh!)
She's a haggler naw I'm not taggin her (oh!)
But you don't want them boys to come over and start askin ya (oh!)
What you wanna do, nigga? (Nothin')
What you tryin' to do, nigga? (Nothin')
What you wanna do, nigga? (Nothin')
What you tryin' to do


Yo, yo, yo..
Yo N-O-R papi, say what? That nigga's the man
With his manager Chris and the label that Jams
Still flossin, showin your rocks
Ain't you dudes heard "Grimey" man we stoled your watch
It goes Indian style, knees bent in dashiki
Strapped with the baby tec baby tec B.T
True she at the bar lookin good in the brown dress
Ordered six shots and them things ain't around yet
Persona all thugged out loud and clear
Sayin fuck the straight Henny, just grab me a beer
You see I'm reppin now, and my mami's I got a weapon now
Shoot at them clowns at they feet, they high steppin now
Left that wack label cause I don't like pricks
I'm like a hammer that you hold on your hand, I make hits
At the white boy club while I'm buyin the bar
They like, "Hey now, you're an all star," it go


Homeboy, I came to party (oh!)
Yo' girl was lookin at me (oh!)
She's a haggler naw I'm not taggin her (oh!)
But you don't want them boys to come over and start askin ya (oh!)
What you wanna do, nigga? (Nothin')
What you tryin' to do, nigga? (Nothin')
What you wanna do, nigga? (Nothin')
What you tryin' to do (Nothin')



I spit mack millimeter rhymes, kill a liter in line
My nigga Peter got a heater of mines
Niggas still lyin, in they wack ass bars
Only time they seen jail, when they watchin "Oz"
I'm in the club pissy drunk like, "Ahhhdadidaaaaa!"
And mami took it proper like, "Dadadidaaaaa!"
Adios kill your soul, then we body your ghost
They call me gordo, I sip the champagne that's importo
Playin "Capicu" (Man you ain't nappy too!)
I like when chocha be nappy too
I treat life like a fast car, lower my speed
I try and chill, and sell more records than Creed
Been a hustler (What? What?) Way before "Melvin Flynt"
A criminal, don't leave no prints
These dudes gave me a brick and they ain't seen me since
Caught up wit 'em, had them dudes straight hoppin the fence, it go


Homeboy, I came to party (oh!)
Yo' girl was lookin at me (oh!)
She's a haggler naw I'm not taggin her (oh!)
But you don't want them boys to come over and start askin ya (oh!)
What you wanna do, nigga? (Nothin')
What you tryin' to do, nigga? (Nothin')
What you wanna do, nigga? (Nothin')
What you tryin' to do (Nothin')


La la la la la la la la la (oh!)
La la la la la la la la la (oh!)
La la la la la la la la la (oh!)
La la la la la la la la la (oh!)
La la la la la la la la la (oh!)
La la la la la la la la la (oh!)
La la la la la la la la la (oh!)
La la la la la la la la la (oh!)


Yo, yo, yo..
Yo oops, I done done it again, I got another one
I keep it hid in my pocket I got another one
"Fast and Furious," dunn dunn dunn tudunn
Still be in, Miami and jet skiing
In the ocean where the sharks be at, just O.D.'n
Adebesi, want a brick you pay double easy
I got them things that'll move easy
And I told the lawyer, I sold blow to old Goya
I'm half spanish, you see I cook coke for Goya
I'm half spanish, all day arroz con polla
Recognize, when I'm runnin the game, before me
Chickens wasn't even messin with brain, because me
Now you started gettin head on the westside highway
So recognize my nigga you did it my way
Ice rockin, brick choppin and gun shoppin
I did it all beat cases without Cochran


Homeboy, I came to party (oh!)
Yo' girl was lookin at me (oh!)
She's a haggler naw I'm not taggin her (oh!)
But you don't want them boys to come over and start askin ya (oh!)
What you wanna do, nigga? (Nothin')
What you tryin' to do, nigga? (Nothin')
What you wanna do, nigga? (Nothin')
What you tryin' to do (Nothin')


La la la la la la la la la (oh!)
La la la la la la la la la (oh!)
La la la la la la la la la (oh!)
La la la la la la la la la (oh!)
La la la la la la la la la (oh!)
