I've seen this world
From corner to corner
There ain't much ground
That I haven't covered

I've drank its wine
I've tasted its pleasures
I've known some love
And I've known some lovers

If there's one lesson
In the livin' I've done
The best things only come
Along in numbers of one

There's only one Eiffel Tower
One finest hour
One New York town
One 5th Avenue

There's only one Mona Lisa
One Leaning Tower Of Pisa
One Paris and there's only one you

I've been a king
And I've been a pauper
And everything there is in between

It took some time
To know what is timeless
But I've found and
Learned what that means

I'll never leave you, girl
'Cause I know the catch
The wonders of this world
Will never come with a match

There's only one Eiffel Tower
One finest hour
One New York town
One 5th Avenue

There's only one Mona Lisa
One Leaning Tower Of Pisa
One Paris and there's only one you

There's only one Eiffel Tower
One finest hour
One New York town
One 5th Avenue

There's only one Mona Lisa
One Leaning Tower Of Pisa
One Paris and there's only one you

There's only one Eiffel Tower
One finest hour
One New York town
One 5th Avenue

There's only one Mona Lisa
One Leaning Tower Of Pisa
One Paris and there's only one you
