There's a crazy little shack beyond the tracks
And everybody calls it the Sugar Shack
Well, it's just a coffeehouse and it's made out of wood
Expresso coffee tastes mighty good
That's not the reason why I've got to get back
To that sugar shack, whoa baby
To that sugar shack

There's this cute little girlie, she's a-working there
A black leotard and her feet are bare
I'm gonna drink a lot of coffee, spend a little cash
Make that girl love me when I put on some trash
You can understand why I've got to get back
To that sugar shack
Whoa baby, to that sugar shack
Yeah honey, to that sugar shack
Whoa yes, to that sugar shack

Now that sugar shack queen is a-married to me, yeah yeah
We just sit around and dream of those old memories
Ah, but one of these days I'm gonna lay down tracks
In the direction of that sugar shack
Just me and her, yes, we're gonna go back
To that sugar shack
Whoa uh oh
To that sugar shack
Yeah honey, to our sugar shack

Yea, yea, yea, our sugar shack
