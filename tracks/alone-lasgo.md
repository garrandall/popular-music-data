If only I had one more chance
to change my life today
Then I would never let you go

All my friends keep telling me 
That I should leave you for a while
So you must show your love to me
And tell me what you feel

I thought that even you had feelings for me too
I know I was wrong
And baby when you care, then I will be there
By your side

And now I stand here alone in the dark
Without you
There's nothing more that I would like
Than be with you
I close my eyes but I can't stop
Thinking of you
And now I stand here alone in the dark
Without you
