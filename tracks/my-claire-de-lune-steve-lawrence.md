I call her Clair de Lune
She walks be moonlight
My Clair de Lune

And when the moon's bright
I'll see her on some sandy beach
Or on a hilltop
Smiling just out of my reach

I reach for Clair de Lune
As one obsessed might look for the moon
As one possessed might see
Something others don't see

I see her face
And I hear a strange melody

How strange and sweet
Is the haunting theme

How strange and sweet
This dream

She's waiting,
Clair de Lune
There where the moonlight
Falls on the dune

I run to meet her
But like all dreams
Mine ends too soon

For just as I approach
My Clair de Lune
She fades and vanishes
Just like the moon

And I am left
With but the lonely tune
