Caught a lite sneeze
Caught a lite breeze
Caught a lightweight lightning seed
Boys on my left side
Boys on my right side
Boys in the middle and you're not here

I need a big loan from the girl zone

Building tumbling down
Didn't know our love was so small
Couldn't stand at all
Mister St. John just bring your son.

The spire is hot and my cells can't feed
You still got that Belle dragging my foots yes
You're hiding it well Sister Ernestine 
But I still got that Belle dragging my foots yes

Building tumbling down
Didn't know our love was so small
Couldn't stand at all
Mister St. John just bring your son.

Right on time it gets closer and closer
Call my name there's no way in
Use that fame
I rent your wife and kids today
Maybe she will
Maybe she willâ¦

Caught a lite sneeze
Dreamed a little dream
Made my own pretty hate machine
Boys on my left side
Boys on my right side
Boys in the middle and you're not here
Boys in their dresses and you're not here
I need a big loan from the girl zone
I need a big, big loan from the girl zone

Building tumbling down
Didn't know our love was so small
Couldn't stand at all
Mister St. John just bring your sonâ¦now
