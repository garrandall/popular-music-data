Caught a lite sneeze, caught a light breeze
Caught a lightweight lightning seed
Boys on my left side, boys on my right side
Boys in the middle and you're not here


I need a big loan
From the girl zone


Building (Inanna)
Tumbling down (Inanna)
Didn't know our love was so small (Inanna)
Couldn't stand it all (Inanna)
Mr. St. John just bring your son


The spire is hot
And my cells can't feed
And you've still got that Belle
Dragging your foots, yes
I'm hiding it well
Sister Ernestine
But I still got that Belle
Dragging my foots, yes


Building (Inanna)
Tumbling down (Inanna)
Didn't know our love was so small (Inanna)
Couldn't stand it all (Bring your son)
Mr. St. John just bring your son


Right on time
You get closer and closer
Called my name
There's no way in
Use that fame
Rent your wife and kids today
Yeah, maybe she will
I said maybe she will


Caught a lite sneeze, dreamed a little dream
Made my own pretty hate machine
Boys on my left side, boys on my right side
Boys in the middle and you're not here
Boys in their dresses and you're not here


I need a big loan
From the girl zone
I need a big loan
From the girl zone


Building (Inanna)
Tumbling down (Inanna)
Didn't know our love was so small (Inanna)
Couldn't stand it all (Bring your son)
Mr. St. John just bring your son
