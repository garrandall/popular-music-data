In my neighborhood we don't live so good
The rooms are small
And the buildings made of wood

I hear the neighbors talking 'bout you and me
I guess I heard it all
'Cause the talk is loud
And the walls are much too thin

He don't really love her
That's what I heard them say
He sure wasn't thinking of her today, oh no
(He wasn't thinking of her today)

I saw them in the front yard
Said the boy in room 149
He was talking to a girl I've never seen before
And standing there together, oh they looked so good

I don't want to hear it anymore
(I don't want to hear it)
I don't want to hear it anymore
(Anymore)
'Cause the talk just never ends
And the heartache soon begins
The talk is so loud
And the walls are much too thin

Ain't it sad, said the woman down the hall
That when a nice girl falls in love
Ain't it just too bad that she had to fall
For a boy who doesn't care for her at all?
(It's so sad)
I don't want to hear it anymore
(I don't want to hear it)
I just can't stand to hear it anymore
(Anymore)
'Cause the talk just never ends
And the heartache soon begins
The talk is so loud
And the walls are much too thin

I don't want to hear it anymore
(Can't stand to hear it)
(Don't want to hear it)
I just can't stand to hear it anymore
(Don't talk about it)
(Can't stand to hear it)
Oh, baby, baby
I just can't stand
