I can see you staring at me
I've been watching you
Maybe act a little bit too shy
You'll have to make the first move
Don't be afraid of comin' on too strong
I'm in a lovin' mood
I've been waiting for you all night long
Don't you know what to do?

Nice Girls
Think a lot about it
Nice Girls
They do it too
Nice Girls
Never talk about it
But Nice Girls need it too

I don't want a bad reputation
I'm not that kind
But maybe in the right situation
You could change my mind
Cause the more I look into your eyes
The less control I have
You bring out a side of me
I never knew I had

(Repeat Chorus)

My friends warn me
Not to fall for a boy like you
But how am I gonna find out
Unless I do
