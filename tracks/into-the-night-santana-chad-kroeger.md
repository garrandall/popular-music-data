Like a gift from the heavens, it was easy to tell
It was love from above, that could save me from hell
She had fire in her soul it was easy to see
How the devil himself could be pulled out of me
There were drums in the air as she started to dance
Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands
And we sang

Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
And the voices rang like the angels sing
We're singing
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
And we danced on into the night
Ay oh ay oh
Ay oh ay oh
And we danced on into the night

Like a piece to the puzzle that falls into place
You could tell how we felt from the look on our faces
She was spinning in circles with the moon in her eyes
No room left to move in between you and I
We forgot where we were and we lost track of time
And we sang to the wind as we danced through the night
And we sang

Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
And the voices rang like the angels sing
We're singing
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
And we danced on into the night
Ay oh ay oh
Ay oh ay oh
And we danced on into the night
Ay oh ay oh
Ay oh ay oh
And we danced on into the night

Like a gift from the heavens, it was easy to tell
It was love from above, that could save me from hell
She had fire in her soul it was easy to see
How the devil himself could be pulled out of me
There were drums in the air as she started to dance
Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands
And we sang

Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
And the voices rang like the angels sing
We're singing
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
And we danced on into the night
Ay oh ay oh
Ay oh ay oh
And we danced on into the night
(And the voices rang like the angels sing)
Ay oh ay oh
Ay oh ay oh
And we danced on into the night
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
(Ay oh ay oh)
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
(Ay oh ay oh)
Singing ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
(Ay oh ay oh)
And we danced on into the night
