Woah, woah, woah

Gone in the sky, over 20, 000
I keep my wifi lit
I spend over 5, 000, that's just on one fit
I'm not going back no more when I ain't have shit
Pray I get a new connect, pray I get a brick

I leave a bitch in the cold, oh
I don't act poor no more
I left her sitting at the Loews, oh
'Cause she wasn't touching her toes, no
I'm on some rich nigga shit
It's all about rich nigga timing
Fully loaded whip
I'm gone curve you kindness
I'm in Hermes drip, not in the store, you can't find it
I got stacks on me and they won't fit no wallet
I got Gucci socks on me and money in every pocket
I got Burberry seats, the color teriyaki
I'm on another wave
Cut the head off the Porsche
Running with a pack of wolves, ain't no extorting
VIP with 8 K's, very important
Always riding with a gas torch
Always riding with a mask
Young nigga playing with a pinky ring
Cost over 500 bags
Already know your homie singing, they 'bout to get him wacked
Soon as you let up, relax
That's when they waiting to attack
Platinum majority of the plaques
Striking it off like a match

Gone in the sky, over 20, 000
I keep my wifi lit
I spend over 5, 000, that's just on one fit
I'm not going back no more when I ain't have shit
Pray I get a new connect, pray I get a brick

You came from public housing, you serving hand to hand, oh
You got that good salmon, and smoking it fresh out the can
You know how to stir your bowl up, you know how to flip your bands
I'm bout to go take 200, 000, just to go shop in Japan
I know the opps they thinking foul, we 'bout to take out they mans
We got to make some bullets shower, show you we ain't playing
You gon' smell this gun powder, it's gone make you dance
I've been counting it up for hours, done cramped my hands

Gone in the sky, over 20, 000
I keep my wifi lit
I spend over 5, 000, that's just on one fit
I'm not going back no more when I ain't have shit
Pray I get a new connect, pray I get a brick

Wifi lit, woah, woah, whoa
Wifi lit
Pass the bitch, woah, woah, whoa
That's an assist
Cooking grits, woah, woah, whoa
Half a chicken
Fuck your clique, woah woah, whoa, got them sticks
Wifi lit, wifi lit
Wifi lit
Wifi lit
Wifi lit
Wifi lit
(Auntie, auntie)
Shoutout to Lil Mexico, Kirkwood

You hear me
Let's go!
