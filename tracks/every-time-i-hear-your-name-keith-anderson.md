Fin'lly got over that song of ours; stopped chasin' little red sports cars,
To check the license plates and I quit drivin' by your place.
Back makin' the rounds at our old haunts... Honky Tonks, restaurants.
An' seein' some of our old friends... it feels good to dance again.
An' I can fin'lly smell your perfume and not look around the room for you.
An' I can walk right by your picture in a frame and not feel a thing.

But when I hear your name,
I feel rain fallin' right out of the blue sky.
An' it's the fifth of May, and I'm right there starin' in your eyes.
An' nothin's changed, and we're still same.
An' I get lost in the innocence of a first kiss,
An' I'm hangin' on to every word rollin' off of your lips...
An' that's all it takes, and I'm in that place,
Every time I hear your name.

Got someone special in my life... everyone thinks she'd make a great wife.
Dad says he thinks she's the one... reminds him of Mom when she was young,
But it's way too soon to be talkin 'bout rings; don't wanna rush into anything.
She's getting over someone too, kinda like me and you.
An' she talks about him every once in a while, and I just nod my head and smile,
'Cause I know exactly what she's goin' through... yeah, I've been there too.

An' when the conversation turns to you,
I get caught in a "you were the only one for me",
Kinda thought, and your face is all that I see.
I know I can't go back when I still go back.
An' there we are, parked down by the riverside,
An' I'm in your arms about to make love for the first time,
An' that's all it takes, and I'm in that place,
Every time I hear your name.

So I'm thinkin' 'bout the words I left unsaid.
(Every time I hear your name.)
Stop tryin' the change the things I can't change.
(Every time I hear your name.)
In my heart I know you're gone, but in my head,

I feel rain fallin' right out of the blue sky.
An' it's the fifth of May, and I'm right there starin' in your eyes.
That's all it takes, and I'm in that place.
An' there we are, parked down by the riverside,
An' I'm in your arms about to make love for the first time.
An' I can't explain, but I'm in that place,
Every time I hear your name.
Every time I hear your name.
(Every time I hear your name.)
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
(Every time I hear your name.)
Ah ah.
Every time I hear your name.
