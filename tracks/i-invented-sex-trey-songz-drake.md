This goes out to the beautiful girls
Which one of ya'll which one of ya'll
Which one of ya'll goin' home with trigga


Seen you in the club oo shawty
Walkin past a ni**a lookin at me all naughty
Then I sad baby wassup
Reach for that hand shake got a hug (got a hug)
Bottles of that H got me with a lil buzz
Up in VIP with all my thugs ni**as
U leaned over and said u want me (want me)
Girl when the valet pull the benz up
Off to the crip shawty where we gon end up
Girl sit back relax hold up
Let me turn the radio on


Girl let me get u to the crib (let me get u to the crib)
Upstairs to the bed (upstairs to the bed)
Girl you gonna think 
Girl when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl you gonna think 
You gonna think I invented sex 


I see you lookin at it like you want it
Got a swag like you know how to put it on me
Kinda wanna take you home (you home)
Lay you on my bed and do the grown (do the grown)
Do we have to wait til the club starts to close
We can go on now leave my girls with ya bros (Let's go)
So I can slip into something sexy (Yuuppp)
Then I'm a put on a little show
Teach ya new things that I bet you didn't now
Boy sit back relax hold up
Let me turn the radio on


Girl let me get u to the crib (let me get u to the crib)
Upstairs to the bed (upstairs to the bed)
Girl you gonna think 
Girl when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl you gonna think 
You gonna think I invented sex 
Cause I'm gonna do it like I did


It's a celebration clap clap bravo
Lobster and shrimp and a glass of moscato
For the girl whose a student and the friend whose a model
Finish the whole bottle and we gon do it big like this
Yea and he was just practice
He ain't in your world you can take him off your atlas
Girl you on fire can I be the one you match with
I'll give you the credit card and baby you can max this out
Show me where your tats is
Show me where you heads at
Maybe I can grasps it
If you ever come up with a question you should ask it
Caught up on your ex still I can get you past it
Yea and your friends all suggest
What's the chance of this ni**a being betta than the rest
Just tell em you appreciate the help
But you just got to know for yourself


Girl let me get u to the crib (let me get u to the crib)
Upstairs to the bed (upstairs to the bed)
Girl you gonna think 
Girl when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl you gonna think 
You gonna think I invented sex
