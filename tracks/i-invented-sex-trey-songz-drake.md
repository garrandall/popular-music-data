Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl
This goes out to the beautiful girls
Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl
Which one of y'all, which, which one
Which, which one of y'all
Which one of y'all going home with Trigga?


I see you in the club, oh, shawty
Walking past a nigga looking at me all naughty
Then I said, "Baby, wassup?"
Reach for that hand shake, got a hug
Bottles of the Ace got me with a lil buzz
Up in VIP with all my thug niggas
You leaned over and said you want me
Girl, when the valet pull the Benz up
Off to the crib, shawty, where we gon' end up
Girl, sit back, relax, hold up
Let me turn the radio on


Girl, when I get you to the crib
Upstairs to the bed
Girl, you gon' think, girl, you gon' think
Girl, you gon' think, girl, you gon' think
Girl, when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl, you gon' think, girl, you gon' think
Girl, you gon' think, girl, you gon' think
You gon' think I invented sex
You gon' think I invented sex
You gon' think I invented sex


Put the code in the gate, pull up to the driveway
Said she like the way I touch her, listening to Usher
I got a confession
Now we 'bout to sin, but your body is a blessing
Father, forgive me
Girl, can we take it up stairs? My bed's waiting there
All I wanna do is is give you all of me
Won't you give me all of you?
I want your body like right now
You know I live a Magnum lifestyle
Baby, turn the lights down and I'mma turn you on


Girl, when I get you to the crib
Upstairs to the bed
Girl, you gon' think, girl, you gon' think
Girl, you gon' think, girl, you gon' think
Girl, when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl, you gon' think, girl, you gon' think
Girl, you gon' think, girl, you gon' think
You gon' think I invented sex
You gon' think I invented sex
'Cause I do it like I think
You gon' think I invented sex


All right
It's a celebration clap, clap, bravo
Lobster and shrimp and a glass of Moscato
For the girl who's a student and the friend who's a model
Finish the whole bottle and we gonna do it big like this
Yeah, and he was just practice
He ain't in your world, you can take him off your atlas
Girl, you on fire, can I be the one you match with?
I'll give you the credit card and baby you can max this out
Show me where your tats is
Show me where you heads at, maybe I can grasp it
If you ever come up with a question, you should ask it
Caught up on your ex still? I can get you past it
Yeah, and your friends all suggest
What's the chance of this nigga being better than the rest?
Just tell 'em you appreciate the help
But you just got to know for yourself


Girl, when I get you to the crib
Upstairs to the bed
Girl, you gon' think, girl, you gon' think
Girl, you gon' think, girl, you gon' think
Girl, when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl, you gon' think, girl, you gon' think
Girl, you gon' think, girl, you gon' think
You gon' think I invented sex
You gon' think I invented sex
You gon' think I invented sex


Now who's coming home with me?
Tell me who's coming with me
I wanna know who's coming home with?
Tell me who's coming with me
Is it you? Is it you? Is it you? Is it you?
Is it you? Is it you? Is it you? Is it you?
