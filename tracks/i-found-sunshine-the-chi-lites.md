I found sunshine
When I found you, oh, baby
I found sunshine
When I found you, oh, baby

Living my way alone in the dark
Nights were dreary
Raining every day

I got down on my knees
And I prayed
That someone just like you
Would come my way

You put me in Heaven
Your loving in the moonlight
You're sweet as candy
Tender as roses

You took the teardrops
Took them away
Today I need you, baby
Baby, day by day by day

I found sunshine
When I found you, oh, baby
I found sunshine
When I found you, oh, baby

Whether I'm one of the many
Or one of the few?
Ain't nobody gonna stop me
From loving you

You'll become the
Only one in my life
You touched me and
Then I saw the light

You put me in Heaven
Your loving in the moonlight
You're sweet as candy
Tender as roses

You took the teardrops
Took them away
Yeah, I need you, baby
Baby, day by day by day

I found sunshine
When I found you

I found sunshine
When I found you, oh, baby
I found sunshine
When I found you, oh, baby

I found sunshine
When I found you, oh, baby
I found sunshine
When I found you, oh, baby
