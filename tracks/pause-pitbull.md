Mr. Worldwide
Mami no you can't come back
Mami no you can't come back
Cause you look so right
Cause you look so right
Cause you look so right
Cause you look so right

Now don't... stop, drop, pause
Now don't... stop, drop, pause

Oh, look at that girl, she's like ah
Look at that girl, she's like oh
Look at that girl, she's like ah
Look at that girl, she's like

Look, I got what you need to get you hooked
I steal all your heart I'm a crook
On Friday night, I'm sorry, I'm booked
Brooke, Maria y la amiga de ella
Tan rica y en la cama no juegan
Explotan y dicen - pause

Now don't... stop, drop, pause
Now don't... stop, drop, pause

Oh, look at that girl, she's like ah
Look at that girl, she's like oh
Look at that girl, she's like ah
Look at that girl, she's like

Mamita would you like to play?
We love to see, would you stay
And if you say OK, we will play night and day
I'm such a dir-dir-dirty dawg
My teeth will unsnap your bra
But for now baby just pause

Now don't... stop, drop, pause
Now don't... stop, drop, pause

Oh, look at that girl, she's like ah
Look at that girl, she's like oh
Look at that girl, she's like ah
Look at that girl, she's like

Mami over there sometime
Mami over there sometime
She got what I like, what I like
What I like, what I like
Mami over there sometime
Mami over there sometime
She got what I like, what I like
What I like, what I like
Mami over there sometime
Mami over there sometime
She got what I like, what I like, pause

Now don't... stop, drop, pause
Now don't... stop, drop, pause

Oh, look at that girl, she's like ah
Look at that girl, she's like oh
Look at that girl, she's like ah
Look at that girl, she's like oh
Look at that girl, she's like ah
Look at that girl, she's like oh
Look at that girl, she's like ah
Look at that girl, she's like
Pause
