Yes sir!
They can't stop me...even if they stopped me ha ha ha yea

I'm on it ohI'm on it I'm so on it and however you want it
You can get it tonight hoe
And all night hoe I get the beat from
(Maestro)
A fucking right hoe

I might go crazy on these niggas I don't give a motherfuck
Run up in a nigga house and shoot his grandmother up what!
What I don't give a motherfuck get you baby kidnapped
And ya baby motherfucked

It's the Carter 3 bitch better put ya supper up
Hollygrove I throw it up like I'm tryna lose my gut
Fuck is up beat him up like a million uppercuts
Got a million duffeled up for the fuck of it
Shit

Get on my level you can't get on my level
You would need a space shuttle or a ladder that's forever
However I'm better if not now then never
Don't you ever fix ya lips unless you bout to suck my dick

Bitch swallow my words taste my thoughts
And if it's too nasty spit it back at me
Two more inches I'd've been in that casket
According to the doctor I could've died in traffic

Bounce right back on them bitches like Magic
Abracadabra I'm up like Viagra
I just do this shit for my click like Adam Sandler
I control hip-hop and I'mma keep it on my channel

Watch me!
Bitch watch me!
Bitch watch me!
But they cannot see me like Hitler
It's the New Orleans Nightmare
Money so old it's growing white hair

Young Money baby
Yeah we right here
I'mma make sure we ball 'til we fall like tears
And mama don't cry
Ya son can handle his
I got her out the hood and put her in the hills

Yeah when I was fourteen I told my mom we will see better days
And sure enough I got Miss. Cita in a better place
When I was fourteen I told my mom we will see better days
And sure enough we did exactly what I say

I told my girl when you fuck me better fuck me good
'Cause if another girl could she gonna fuck me good
No sitting at the table if you bringing nothing to it
And I get straight to it like it's nothing to it

Yeah, I got game like Stuart Scott
Fresh out the ESPN shop
And when sports center popping
Everything stopping
But you can't fool me
I know what you watching

Me!
You watch me
You watch me
'Cause I be
Weezy
Must see
T.V.
C3
Nigga that's me
And I'm me
I'm me
Times three
So retreat
Or suffer defeat
I'm back 3 Peat
C3
