Pardon me boy
Is that the chattanooga choo choo
Track 29 boy you can give me a shine
I can afford
To board a Chattanooga Choo choo
I've got my fare and just a trifle to spare

Well you leave the Pennsylvania station
'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner at the diner
Nothing could be finer
Then you have your ham and eggs in Carolina

When you hear the whistle blowing
Eight to the bar
Then you know that Tenneesse is not very far
Shovel all the coal in
Gotta keep it rolling
Whoo, Whoo, Chattanooga there you are

There's gonna be
A certain party at the station
Satin and lace
I used to call funny face
She's gonna cry Until
I tell her that I'll never roam. So
Chattanooga Choo Choo
Won't you Choo Choo me home!
