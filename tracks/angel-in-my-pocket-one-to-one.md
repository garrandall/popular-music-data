I've been living on the edge of time
Never thinkin' twice inside my mind
I've been given a second chance too
Since I found him I never lose

I caught an angel in my pocket
I caught an angel, he's forever mine

Make three wishes, catch a falling star (star, star)
Take me somewhere, take me very far
Freedom, fortune to name a few, too
Holds my secrets, he knows the truth

I caught an angel in my pocket
I caught an angel, he's forever mine
I caught an angel in my pocket
I caught an angel 'til the end of time

Now I'm never alone, he will never leave
I can dream the unknown every night
Lead me into the shadows behind the door
Lead me into a forest of light

I've been livin' on this edge of time
I made three wishes and now he's mine

I caught an angel in my pocket
I caught angel, he's forever mine
I caught an angel in my pocket
I caught angel 'til the end of time

Caught an angel (oh, oh I know that he's mine)
Caught an angel (I wanna keep him 'til the end of time)
Caught an angel (oh, oh I know that he's mine)
Caught an angel (I wanna keep him 'til the end of time)
Caught an angel (oh, oh I know that he's mine)
Caught an angel (I wanna keep him 'til the end of time)
