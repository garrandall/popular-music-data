Now that we love
Now that the lonely nights are over
How do we make love stay?
Now that we know
The fire can burn bright or merely smolder
How do we keep it from dying away?

Elusive as dreams
Barely remembered in the morning
Love like a phantom flies
But held in the heart
It pales like the empty smile adorning
A statue with sightless eyes.

Moments fleet, taste sweet within the rapture
When precious flesh is greedily consumed
But mystery's a thing not easily captured
And once deceased not easily exhumed.

Now that we love
Now that the lonely nights are over
How do we make love stay?

Moments fleet, taste so sweet within the rapture
When precious flesh is greedily consumed
But mystery's a thing not easily captured
And once deceased not easily exhumed.

Now that we loved
Look at the moonless night and tell me
How do we make love stay?
