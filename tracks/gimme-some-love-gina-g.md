Gimme gimme Whoo-o! Whoo-o!
Sweet as honey your lips like taste
You touch my body and you've been praised
So deep is my love for you
Anticipated any single move
You are the one that I'm dreaming of
Won't you stay with me tonight baby
You're all I want, all I'm thinking of
Move your body close to mine
Chorus
Gimme gimme gimme some love whoo-o! Whoo-o!
I've been waiting forever
Gimme gimme gimme some love whoo-o! Whoo-o!
Boy I can't wait any longer
Don't you know you got me under your spell
You drive me crazy like no-one else
One kiss and I'm hypnotised
You're looking to me with those spectrum eyes
You are the one that I'm dreaming of
Won't you stay with me tonight baby
You're all I want, all I'm thinking of
Move your body close to mine
Chorus
I can't wait any longer
It feels so good inside I must be dreaming (Oooh dreaming)
Only you can satisfy this feeling
Am I dreaming?
Am I dreaming?
Am I dreaming?
Chorus x 2
Gimme gimme gimme some love whoo-o!
Repeat to fade
