Ooh, Sunday morning
You;re gonna find my love shining on you

Oh, I'm waiting
And my heart is anticipating
Your face
On my pillow
Feel sunshine pouring through the window

Like the grapes on the vine
Love gets sweeter with time
You were made to love


Ooh, Sunday morning (I'll see you Sunday morning)
Ooh, Sunday morning
It's like the best of everything falling on you

Your eyes
Shining on me
You're the brightest star, that ever could be
Your kiss
Oh, I'm so thankful
The love that we share, I'm sincerely grateful

The wind blowin' in the tree
Singing love songs to me
Singing you were made to love


Ooh, Sunday morning (I'll see you Sunday morning)
You're gonna find my love shining on you
Ooh, Sunday morning
It's like the best of everything falling on you

Ooh, Sunday morning (I'll see you Sunday morning)
When we shared sweet love like no other

Ooh, Sunday morning
Like a summer day with your lover
Ooh Sunday morning (I'll see you Sunday morning)
When we shared sweet love like no other
