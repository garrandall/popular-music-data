It's been such a lonely life
Since you walked out on me
Without a warning one early morning
You're gone, not a letter
Not a call, not a signal at all

It's been such a lonely life
And you'll never know
How I'm hurting inside

My world is shaken
I feel forsaken
Teardrops are falling
My heart is calling
Come on girl
To my lovin' arms

Oh darling
You're the only thing I've been living for
Now that you're gone
I realize I need you even more

It's been such a lonely life
You'd better return
Or I think I'm gonna die

Oh our love can't be just a memory
I'm in deep despair
Tell me that you care
'Cause it's been such a lonely life

Every day of my life has been lonely
I'm in despair
Tell me that you care
Come on, whoa pretty baby
Yeah pretty baby
Oh please, oh come on
