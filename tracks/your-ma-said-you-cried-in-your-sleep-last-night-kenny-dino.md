Ba ba ba ba...

Your ma said you cried
In your sleep last night
Your ma said you cried
In your sleep last night

You should have seen
The look in her eye
I had a dose of little white lies

I know I haven't
Been so true to you
I know I haven't
Been so true to you

Don't you cry, don't you cry
Don't you cry no, no
Ain't gonna be the
Way it was before

Ooh, I love you
Ooh, I love you
Let me kiss you
Let me hold you tight

Ooh, I love you
Ooh, I love you so much that
My ma said I cried
My ma said I cried
My ma said I cried
In my sleep last night

Ooh, I love you
Ooh, I love you
Let me kiss you
Let me hold you tight

Ooh, I love you
Ooh, I love you so much that
My ma said I cried
My ma said I cried
My ma said I cried
In my sleep last night
