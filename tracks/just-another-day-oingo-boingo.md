(There's life underground)

I feel it all around
I feel it in my bones
My life is on the line
When I'm away from home
When I step out the door
The jungle is alive
I do not trust my ears
I don't believe my eyes
I will not fall in loveâI cannot risk the bet
'Cause hearts are fragile toysâso easy to forget

It's just another day
There's murder in the air
It drags me when I walk
I smell it everywhere
It's just another day
Where people cling to light
To drive away the fear
That comes with every night

It's just another day.... It's just another day
It's just another day.... It's just another day....
It's just another day when people wake from dreams
The voices in their ears that will not go away

I had a dream last night:
The world was set on fire
And everywhere I ran
There wasn't any water
The temperature increased
The sky was crimson red
The clouds turned into smoke
And everyone was dead

(But)
There's a smile on my face...for everyone
There's a golden coin...that reflects the sun
There's a lonely place...that's always cold
There's a place in the stars...for when you get old

There's razors in my bed
That come out late at night
They always disappear
Before the morning light
I'm dreaming again
Of life underground
It doesn't ever move
It doesn't make a sound
And just when I thinkâthat things are in their place
The heavens are secureâthe whole thing explodes in my face

It's just another day.... It's just another day
It's just another day.... It's just another day....
