There are some who can still remember
All the things that we used to do
But the days of our youth were numbered
And the ones who survive it are few
Oh, I can still see the smiling faces
When the times were so good
All in the old familiar places
I'd go back if I could (to the)

People of the south wind, people of the southern wind
It's the people of the wind, I got to be there again

Well, it's a hard thing to face the music:
But it's something everybody has got to do
So I hope that I can always remember
All the crazy times we had to go through
Now it's a dream that is slowly fading
And I don't want it to go
All of the memories are evading
And I want you to know (it's the)

People of the south wind, people of the southern wind
It's the people of the wind, I got to be there again

Now we've traveled all across the oceans
And we've seen what there is to see
But I guess it's not the proper solution
Cause it's all about the same to me
Now I look back and it makes me wonder
Why we just couldn't see
All of the battles we fought and won there
And I wish that I could be with the

People of the wind
I want to see 'em again
It's where we used to be free
And that's the place for me
It's just a state of my mind
A thing that's so hard to find
