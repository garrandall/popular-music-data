Yeah, they call me, yeah, Hot and Nasty
Yeah, they call me, uh, Mister Fancy
Yeah, when you ball me
Yeah, you're hot and nasty
Oh, when you ball me
You're Miss Fancy
Right

When I come a knockin' at your door
Let me in and I'll tell you some more
No two men are ever the same
And they tell me
Jim Dandy is my name

Yeah, they call me, yeah, Hot and Nasty
Yeah, they call me, uh, Mister Fancy
Yeah, when you ball me
Yeah, you're hot and nasty
Oh, when you ball me
You're Miss Fancy
Right

They say Jim Dandy is my name
They say Jim Dandy is my name
Always to blame
Always to blame
And always just the same

Yeah, Hot and Nasty
Oh, they call me, uh, Mister Fancy
Yeah, when you ball me
Yeah, you're hot and nasty
Oh, when you ball me
You're Miss Fancy
Right

Hot and Nasty
