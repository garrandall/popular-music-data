Yeah LT
And it's the brat tat tat yall
And its another album
Uh huh and its so phat phat phat yall

Oh
Im in love
Im in love
Im in love
Im in love with you
And there aint nothing I won't do for my Baby
You drive me Crazy
And it makes me Say
Oh
Im in love
Im in love
Im in love
Im in love with you
And there aint nothing nobody can say cuz you're the one for me Baby

When I wake up in the morning it's You
When I can't sleep at night it's You
When im tossin and turning its You
When my body yearnin it's You

Im in love like Maxwell
You see me cryin but I just can't help it
Myself esteem is even higher when im walking with you
You give me fire and desire
Like Tina Marie and Rick James do
I don't care burn up the minutes on the cell
Just turn up the music and feel its hard as hell
I get abusive with the flows on me
When I seduce em' they just wanna hold me
Cuz im so smooth and it's real not phony
With a nigga you will never be lonely
Its been official im hot
And since you is, lets do this
It seems I been shot by cupid
Am I gonna stop, think not that's stupid cuz . . .

Oh
Im in love
Im in love
Im in love
Im in love with you
And there aint nothing I won't do for my Baby
You drive me Crazy
And it makes me Say
Oh
Im in love
Im in love
Im in love
Im in love with you
And there aint nothing nobody can say cuz you're the one for me Baby

Im in love with you more than my car
More than my house
More than the night I keep your name comin out my mouth
I can't get you off my mind
Finally found somebody who see me instead what's on the out side
As fine as Roy Jones
Makin a move in my bones
You presents makes everything else irrelevant when we close
Turn off the 2-way
You lay your head on my pillow
And do me baby
The rhythm gonna get chu groovin baby
And we can rock until broad day light
Body's knockin the boots
Destroying property, poppin me up to get through
It aint right the way you feeling on my booty
Its just you and me
Unexplanatory the way you adore me
Lord have mercy somebody gonna have to pray for me
Your worthy, my service is superb
On purpose im swerving all the way to ya heart

Oh
Im in love
Im in love
Im in love
Im in love with you
And there aint nothing I won't do for my Baby
You drive me Crazy
And it makes me Say
Oh
Im in love
Im in love
Im in love
Im in love with you
And there aint nothing nobody can say cuz you're the one for me Baby

When I wake up in the morning it's You
When I can't sleep at night it's You
When im tossin and turning its You
When my body yearnin it's You
When I wake up in the morning it's You
When I can't sleep at night it's You
When im tossin and turning its You
When my body yearnin it's You
Oh
Im in love
Im in love
Im in love
Im in love with you
And there aint nothing I won't do for my Baby
You drive me Crazy
And it makes me Say
Oh
Im in love
Im in love
Im in love
Im in love with you
And there aint nothing nobody can say cuz you're the one for me Baby
