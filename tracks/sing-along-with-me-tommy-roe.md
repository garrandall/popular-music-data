Sing along with me
And you will see
The golden sunshine
Breaking through
Those dark, dark clouds
Hanging over your head

Sing along with me
And you'll forget
All the little things
That bother you
I'm sure that you'll agree
If you sing along with me

I'm a lucky guy
I hardly ever cry
But when I'm feeling down
I sing a song

So if you're feeling blue
You can do it too
All you have to do
Is sing along

Sing along with me
And you'll forget
Problems you created for yourself
Now, wipe away the tears
There's no reason to cry

Sing along with me
And you will see
The sad sad faces walking by
Turn around and smile
If you'll sing along with me

You should know by now
I have told you how
To make things right
Should they go wrong

Simple as can be
You can plainly see
All you have to do is sing along

Sing along with me
And you will see
The golden sunshine
Breaking through
Those dark, dark clouds
Hanging over your head

Sing along with me
And you'll forget
All the little things
That bother you
I'm sure that you'll agree
If you sing along with me

(To fade)
