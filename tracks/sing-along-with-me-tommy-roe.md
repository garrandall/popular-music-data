Midnight clouds, drift across the sky
As the desert wind, plays a lullaby
And the melody, reminds me
The night we met, was destiny, remember

Remember, it was on a night like this
Remember, it started with a kiss
Just the two of us, dancing in the dark
So young and free, following our heart

As the music plays, on the radio
A favorite tune, from so long ago
I can still recall, how you loved that song
And how you'd smile, when you'd sing along, remember

Remember, it was on a night like this
Remember, it started with a kiss
Now look at us
We're still dancing in the dark
Like two foolish kids, following our heart

Remember, it was on a night like this
