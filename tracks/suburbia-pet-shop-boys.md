Lost in the high street, where the dogs run
Roaming suburban boys
Mother's got her hairdo to be done
She says they're too old for toys
Stood by the bus stop with a felt pen
In this suburban Hell
And in the distance a police car
To break the suburban spell


Let's take a ride and run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia
You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia


Break the window by the town hall
Listen, a siren screams
There in the distance like a roll call
Of all the suburban dreams


Let's take a ride and run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia
You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia


I only wanted something else to do but hang around
I only wanted something else to do but hang around
I only wanted something else to do but hang around
I only wanted something else to do but hang around

It's on the front page of the papers:
"This Is Their Hour of Need"
Where's a policeman when you need one
To blame the colour TV?


Let's take a ride and run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia
You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia


Take a ride and run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia
You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia


Run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia
You can't hide
In suburbia
In suburbia
In suburbia
In suburbia
In suburbia
