Suburbia's a slipstream
To a memory
Of a time when you were
Close to me
I pretend
I'm there again
I close my eyes and see you
Better than before
Then I feel you touch me
And it's 1984
I know what you will say
Before you start
In my heart

We're the Pet Shop Boys
We're the Pet Shop Boys

Every thought's a fashion
Or a crime
And every boy is just
A waste of time
But I pretend
It was different then
Maybe it's a habit
Maybe it's a sin
But I find out
When I try it on
It crawls beneath my skin
Once it gets inside me
It won't go
Now I know

We're the Pet Shop Boys
We're the Pet Shop Boys

Rent
Shopping
Being boring
It's alright
It's a sin
I'm not scared
In denial
I want a dog
I want a lover
Can you forgive her?
Do I have to?
What have I? What have I?
What have I done to deserve this?

We're the Pet Shop Boys
We're the Pet Shop Boys
