I'll touch a star
When your lips touch mine
The first I see
In the twilight time

I'll touch a star
Shining through the sky
But it won't shine
As bright as your eyes

Verse:
Don't make me wait here
At heaven's door
It's only one kiss
That I'm asking for

Chorus:
I'll touch a star
Take it from the blue
And give away
My heart to you

Verse

Chorus

And give a way my heart to you
I'll touch a star.
