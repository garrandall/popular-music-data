In my bag now
In my bag now
What the fuck is that sound
What the fuck is that sound

I brought the mac out, niggas sat down
I got shit i never had now i can brag now, i can brag now
Got my bitch a louis bag now, she can brag now
Got my bitch a birkin bag now, she a brat now
Now i'm sittin' in the club in a different bag now
Baby when i pick it up you gon' put that ass down
Tell 'em you don't give a fuck, baby spin that ass 'round
Tell the dj turn it up, what the fuck in that sound
A boogie wit da hoodie and it's always foreign
Yea i know she like my style, them other niggas borin'
When i pull up it go skrrt skrrt, that's a foreign
When i pull up at a red light they don't want it
Yeah came in from the mud and my baby know that
Introduced her to my plug, now she think she all that
When i first hit her up, no she never wrote back
So i sa her at the club and i got up on that

Now every time they play this song she say
"This my shit"
See the flick of my wrist
And i know she know wassup, baby this is my shit
See the flick of my wrist

They know that my bitch that's a fact and she stuck wit me
When you in my section fill it up when my cup empty
I can't fuck wit rats that's a fact
That's a dub nigga
All about my f, can't put water over blood nigga
Trust me it get ugly
If i wasn't getting money
Would you still want me
If i told you i was broke would you stop actin' funny
This is all i every wanted you can't take from me

Now every time they play this song she say
"This my shit"
See the flick of my wrist
And i she know wassup
Baby this is my shit
See the flick of my wrist
