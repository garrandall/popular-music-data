Are you ready Steve?
"Uh huh"
Andy?
"Yeah"
Mick?
"Okay"
Alright fellas, let's go!


Oh, it's been getting so hard
Living with the things you do to me, aha
My dreams are getting so strange
I'd like to tell you everything I see


Oh, I see a man at the back
As a matter of fact, his eyes are as red as a sun
And a girl in the corner, let no one ignore her
Cause she thinks she's the passionate one


Oh, yeah, it was like lightning
Everybody was frightening
And the music was soothing
And they all started grooving
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...


And the man at the back said
Everyone attack and it turned into a ballroom blitz
And the girl in the corner said
Boy, I wanna warn ya, it'll turn into a ballroom blitz

Ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz


I'm reaching out for something
Touching nothing is all I ever do
Oh, I softly call you over
When you appear there's nothing left of you, aha


Now the man in the back
Is ready to crack as he raises his hands to the sky
And the girl in the corner is everyone's mourner
She could kill you with a wink of her eye


Oh yeah, it was electric
So frantically hectic
And the band started leaving
Cause they all stopped breathing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...


And the man at the back said
Everyone attack and it turned into a ballroom blitz
And the girl in the corner said
Boy, I wanna warn ya, it'll turn into a ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz
(Ballroom blitz)


Oh yeah, it was like lightning
Everybody was frightening
And the music was soothing
And they all started grooving
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...


And the man at the back said
Everyone attack and it turned into a ballroom blitz
And the girl in the corner said
Boy, I wanna warn ya, it'll turn into a ballroom blitz

Ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz


Ooh, it's, it's a ballroom blitz
It's, it's a ballroom blitz
It's, it's a ballroom blitz
Yeah, it's a ballroom blitz
