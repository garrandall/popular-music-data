She comes on like a rose but everybody knows
She'll get you in Dutch
You can look but you better not touch

Poison ivy, poison ivy
Late at night while you're sleepin'
Poison ivy comes creepin', around

She's pretty as a daisy
But look out man she's crazy
She'll really do you in
If you let her get under your skin

Poison ivy, poison ivy
Late at night while you're sleepin'
Poison ivy comes creepin', around

Measles make you bumpy
And mumps'll make you lumpy
And chicken pox'll make you jump and twitch

A common cold'll fool ya
And whooping cough can cool ya
But poison ivy, Lord'll make you itch

You're gonna need an ocean
Of calamine lotion
You'll be scratchin' like a hound
The minute you start to mess around

Poison ivy, poison ivy
Late at night while you're sleepin'
Poison ivy comes creepin', around

Measles make you bumpy
And mumps'll make you lumpy
And chicken pox'll make you jump and twitch

A common cold'll fool ya
And whooping cough can cool ya
But poison ivy, Lord'll make you itch

You're gonna need an ocean of calamine lotion
You'll be scratchin' like a hound
The minute you start to mess around

Poison ivy, poison ivy
Late at night while you're sleepin'
Poison ivy comes creepin', around

La da la da la da
La da la da la da
La da la da la da
La da la da la da
