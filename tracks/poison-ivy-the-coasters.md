She comes on like a rose
And everybody knows
She'll get you in dutch
You can look but you'd better not touch

Poison ivy, poison ivy
Well late at night while you're sleeping
Poison ivy comes a-creeping all around

She's pretty as a daisy
But look out man she's crazy
She'll really do you in
If you let her get under your skin

Poison ivy, poison ivy
Well late at night when you're sleeping
Poison ivy comes a creeping all around

Measles make you bumpy and mumps'll make you lumpy
And chicken pox'll make you jump and twitch
A common cold'll cool you but whooping cough'll fool you
But poison ivy's gonna make you itch

You're gonna need an ocean
Of calamine lotion
You'll be scratching like a hound
The minute you start to mess around

Poison ivy, poison ivy
Well late at night when you're sleeping
Poison ivy comes a-creeping all around

Measles make you bumpy and mumps'll make you lumpy
And chicken pox'll make you jump and twitch
A common cold'll cool you, a whooping cough'll fool you
But poison ivy's gonna make you itch

You're gonna need an ocean
Of calamine lotion
You'll be scratching like a hound
The minute you start to mess around

Poison ivy, poison ivy
Well late at night when you're sleeping
Poison ivy comes a creeping all around

La la la la...
