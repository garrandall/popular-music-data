When your baby leaves you all alone
And nobody calls you on the phone
Don't you feel like crying
Don't you feel like crying
Well, here I am, my honey
C'mon, cry to me
When you're all alone in your lonely room
And there's nothing but the smell of her perfume
Don't you feel like crying?
Don't you feel like crying?
Don't you feel like crying?
C'mon, c'mon, cry to me
Whoa, nothing can be sadder than a glass of wine alone
Loneliness, loneliness, such a waste of time, whoa yeah
You don't ever have walk alone, you see
Come take my hand, and baby, won't you walk with me?
Whoa yeah
When you're waiting for a voice to come
In the night but there's no one
Don't you feel like crying? (Cry to me)
Don't you feel like crying? (Cry to me)
Don't you feel like cr-cr-cr-cr-cr-cr-cry
(Cry to me) cr-cr-cr-cr-cr-cr-crying? (Cry to me)
Don't you feel like
Cr-cr-cr-cr-cr-cr-cry (Cry to me) cr-cr-cr-cr-cr-cr-crying?
