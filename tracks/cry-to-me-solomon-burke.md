When someone
Leaves you all alone
And nobody
Calls you on the phone
Don't you feel like crying?
Don't you feel like crying?
Well here I am, boy
Cry to me

When you're all alone
In your lonely room
And there's nothing
But the smell of perfume
Don't you feel like crying?
Don't you feel like crying?
Don't you feel like crying?
C'mon, cry to me
Cry to me

Nothing could be sadder than a glass of wine alone
Loneliness, loneliness, it just a waste of time
C'mon
When your heart beats, pounding like a rabbit's in the night
I'll hold you
And tell you everything's alright

Cry to me
Cry, cry to me
Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry to me
Cry to me
Cry to me
Cry, cry, cry to me
