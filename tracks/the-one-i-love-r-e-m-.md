This one goes out to the one I love
This one goes out to the one I've left behind
A simple prop to occupy my time
This one goes out to the one I love


Fire!
Fire!


This one goes out to the one I love
This one goes out to the one I've left behind
A simple prop to occupy my time
This one goes out to the one I love (Love)


Fire! (She's comin' down on her own, now)
Fire! (She's comin' down on her own)

This one goes out to the one I love (Love)
This one goes out to the one I've left behind
Another prop has occupied my time
This one goes out to the one I love (Love)


Fire! (She's comin' down on her own, now)
Fire! (She's comin' down on her own)
Fire! (She's comin' down on her own, now)
Fire! (She's comin' down on her own)
