I sure could use an âAtta boyâ or a big ol' high five
I'd love to hear âYou're killin' it dudeâ, it's been a long time
Since I hit one out of the park or nailed it as they say
I guess I've been in a dry spell but that's about to change âcause

Every week has a weekend
By this time Friday night
I'll be done with my third can of cold Bud Light
And I'll be crushin' it
Yeah, I'll be crushin' it

Let's say your baby's mad âcause you told her that you'd hang some pictures for her
You know the ones she framed from late last spring of you and her in Florida
You're up on the ladder when it shatters into smithereens
She shakes her head and looks at you and says âAin't you good for anything?â
And you say

Every week has a weekend
By this time Friday night
If you want a margarita
I'll get tequila and ice
And I'll be crushin' it
With a cold one in my other hand
And I'll be crushin' it

When I'm finished with my can
I can stomp it with my boot
Punch it with my fist
Smash it on my forehead
Yeah, I got this
I'll be crushin' it
Oh, I'll be crushin' it

I figured this out in college walking past them Gothic columns
That I was gonna probably wind up somewhere near the bottom
I was never gonna be the best or brightest guy around
But like the great George freaking Strait, I'm the king of gettin' unwound

And every week has a weekend
By this time Friday night
I'll be done with my third can of cold Bud Light
And I'll be crushin' it
Every week has a weekend
Yeah, I'll be crushin' it
By this time Friday night
Oh, I'll be crushin' it
I'll be done with my third can
Oh, I'll be crushin' it
Of cold Bud Light
And I'll be crushin' it
I'll be crushin' it
