The milk truck hauls the sun up
The paper hits the door
The subway shakes my floor
And I think about you
Time to face the dawning grey
Of another lonely day
It's so hard living without you

So hard, so hard
It's so hard living without you
So hard, so hard
It's so hard living without you

Everyone's got something
They're all tryin' to get some more
They've got something to get up for
Well, I ain't about to
Nothing's gonna happen
Nothing's gonna change
It's so hard living without you

It's so hard, so hard
It's so hard living without you
So hard, so hard
It's so hard living without you
So hard, so hard
It's so hard living without you

So hard
(Yeah, so hard)
Living without you
So hard
Living without you
(repeat and fade)
