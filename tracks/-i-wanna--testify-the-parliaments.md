Friends, inquisitive friends
Are asking me what's come over me
There's been a change (there's been a change)
And it's oh so plain to see

Love just walked in on me
And it's taken me by surprise
Happiness surrounds me
You can see it in my eyes
Now it was just a little while ago
My life was was incomplete
I was down so doggone low
Had to look up at my feet
Don't you know that

I just wanna testify
What your love has done for me
I just wanna testify
What your love has done for me

Once I was a hollow man
In which a lonely heart did dwell
You know love came creeping upon me
Bringing life to an empty shell
Now I heard so many times before
That your love could be so bad
I just want to tell you people
It's the best love I ever had
Don't you know that

I just wanna testify
What your love has done for me
I just wanna testify
What your love has done for me

Ooh...luscious
Sure been delicious to me
Ooh...luscious
Sure been delicious to me

I just wanna testify
What your love has done for me
I just wanna testify
What your love has done for me
