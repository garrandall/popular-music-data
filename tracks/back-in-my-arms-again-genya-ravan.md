(Oh)

All day long, I hear my telephone ring
Friends calling giving their advice
From the boy I love, I should break away
'Cause heartaches, he’ll bring one day

I lost him once through friends' advice
But it's not gonna happen twice
’Cause all advice ever gotten me
Was really long and sleepless nights
(Oh)

But now, he's back in my arms again
Right by my side
I got him back in my arms again
So satisfied
(Oh)

It's easy for friends to say let him go
But I'm the one who needs him so
It's his love that makes me strong
Without him, I can't go on

This time, I'll live my life at ease
Being happy loving whom I please
And each time we make romance
I'll be thankful for a second chance
(Oh)

’Cause he’s back in my arms again
Right by my side
I got him back in my arms again
So satisfied
(Oh)

How can Mary tell me what to do
When she lost her love so true?
And Flo, she don't know
’Cause the boy she loves is a Romeo

I listened once to my friends' advice
But it's not gonna happen twice
'Cause all advice ever gotten me
Was really long and sleepless nights
(Oh)

I got him back in my arms again
Right by my side
I got him back in my arms again
So satisfied
(Oh)

I’m satisfied
So satisfied, I'm satisfied
I'm satisfied, so satisfied
