What's gonna happen
When the summer's done

Every day since school's been through
I have a ball at the beach with you
Down by the shore, walking hand in hand
Kissing and a twisting in the sand

Now tell me, what's gonna
Happen when the summer's done
When there's no more
Partys and no more fun
Will I still be number one
When the summer's done

Drive-in movies, then we park
Kissing and a hugging in the dark
Down to the soda shop, meet the crowd
Dancing to the jukebox playing loud

What's gonna happen
When the summer's done

What's gonna happen
When the summer's done

Right now, we're having a ball
What's gonna happen in the fall
Will you still be the same old you
Will we still do the things we're doing

What's gonna happen
When the summer's done
When there's no more
Partys and no more fun
Will I still be number one
When the summer's done

What's gonna happen
When the summer's done

What's gonna happen
When the summer's done
