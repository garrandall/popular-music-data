The Dream]
Radio Killa
Did a song with the American Dream
They can't put it down like this, no no no no
On my baby, she my shawty
Oh, we rockin
They gotta trip all up on their breath
They hate on us

Now who’s right there every time you cry?
Gonna sleep and wake up on your side?
Endless love I'll always provide
They hatin on us and you should know why
But who’s be lovin you lately?
Who’s willing to go half on the baby?
Who oo oo’s trying to flag our ship?
They just tryin to get the love you give
But baby


Tell me what they know about my love (my love)


So they don’t understand why I'll never leave you
Explain my love? I don’t need to
Got everybody way up in our business
Cuz lovin each other stay on their wish list
I see them reachin everytime you call me baby
They on my back like a shirt, get off me baby
They don’t love me, let them wonder why
Here to stay and they going bye bye
Who’s the one calling you baby
Who’s in love with your ass like crazy?
Who who who’s gonna flag our ship?
They just tryna get the love u give baby

Tell me what they know about my love (my love)

My love is your love
There ain’t nothing in this world that they can do to make me give you up
Oh baby you will always be my girl
So let them do whatever, say whatever
Cuz I ain't givin her up

Tell me what they know about my love (my love)
