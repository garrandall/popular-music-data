Happiness hit her like a train on a track
Coming towards her, stuck still no turning back
She hid around corners and she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
With every bubble she sank with a drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming so you better run

Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children and your sisters, and brothers
Leave all your love and your loving behind you
Can't carry it with you if you want to survive

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
Cuz here they come

And I never wanted anything from you
Except everything you had
And what was left after that too. oh.

Happiness it hurt like a bullet in the head
Struck from great height
Like someone who should know better than that

The dog days are over
The dog days are gone
Can you hear the horses?
Cuz here they come

Run fast for your mother, and fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your loving behind you
Can't carry it with you if you want to survive

The dog days are over
The dog days are gone
Can you hear the horses?
Because here they come

The dog days are over
The dog days are gone
Can you hear the horses because here they come
