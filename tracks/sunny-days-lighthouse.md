I left you deep in the water
I left your heart out to drown
You call to me
I trim the ways so helplessly
I felt so cold in the morning
Days turn to months into years
Now I can see, it wasn't so easy, baby

Sunny skies, but yeah my mind is dark
Rolling through the waves of what we were
I know we are drifting far away from shore
But know that I will be here evermore

In lighthouses
Searching for you out there
Wondering if you care
Lighthouses
Hoping to call you home
But here I am standing alone, yeah

Our memories hold me under
They take the breath out my lungs
And call me out
I was the one who let you down
Why did I feel hesitation?
Why was I scared of the storm?
Look at me now
I'm praying to see the clouds

Sunny skies, but yeah my mind is dark
Rolling through the waves of what we were
I know we are drifting far away from shore
But know that I will be here evermore

In lighthouses
Searching for you out there
Wondering if you care
Lighthouses
Hoping to call you home
But here I am standing alone, yeah

And to thought that you could see when I'm lost, yeah I lost me
And to thought that you could see when I'm lost, yeah I lost me
