Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you

Look at my mind floating away

He's the kind of guy that would say
"Hey, baby, let's get away,
Let's go some place, huh?
Where? I don't care."

He's the kind of guy that you give your everything
Entrust your heart, share all of your love
'Til death do you part

I wanna be what he wants
When he wants it and whenever he needs it
And when he's lonesome and feelin' love starved
I'll be there to feed it

I'm lovin' him a little bit more each day
Turns me right on when I hear him say,

"Hey, baby, let's get away,
Let's go somewhere, huh?
Baby, can we?
Where? I don't care.
Hey, baby, let's get away,
Let's go somewhere, huh?
Baby, can we?
Where? I don't care."

I wanna be what he wants when he wants it
And whenever he needs it
And when he's lonesome and feelin' loved starved
I'll be there to feed it

Lovin' him a little bit more each day
It turns me right on when I hear him say,

"Hey, baby, let's get away,
Let's go somewhere, huh?
Baby, can we?
Where? I don't care.
Hey, baby, let's get away,
Let's go somewhere, huh?
Baby, can we?
Where? I don't care."

Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you

Look at my mind floating away

Daydreaming
Thinking of you
Daydreaming
Thinking of you
Daydreaming
Daydreaming
