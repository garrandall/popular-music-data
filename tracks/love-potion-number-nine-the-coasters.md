(Serve it up)
I took my troubles
Down to Madame Ruth
(And drink it down)
You know that gypsy
With the gold-capped tooth

She's got a storefront
At Thirty-Fourth and Vine
Selling little bottles of
Love potion number nine

(Serve it up)
Love potion number nine
(And drink it down)

(Serve it up)
I told her that I
Was a flop with chicks
(And drink it down)
I've been that way
Since 1966

She looked at my palm
And she made a magic sign
She said, what you need is
Love potion number nine

(Serve it up)
Love potion number nine
(And drink it down)

She bent down and turned
Around and gave me a wink
She said, I'm gonna mix it up
Right here in the sink

It smelled like turpentine
And looked like Indian ink
I held my nose, I closed my eyes
I took a drink

(Serve it up)
I didn't know if
It was day or night
(And drink it down)
I started kissing
Everything in sight

But when I kissed a cop
Down at Thirty-Fourth and Vine
He broke my little bottles of
Love potion number nine

(Serve it up)
Love potion number nine
(And drink it down)

Serve it up
And drink it down
Serve it up
And drink it down
Serve it up
And drink it down
