Yo...hey luv I wanna hold you and talk to you,

need a nigga like P to just flow wit chu,
and I gotta try cuz anything possible,
and you just might see things the way I do
i just wanna get next to you, friends wit you
burn hunids wake up in the bed wit chu
i luv when you walk how that body move,
pardon my mouth IM just bein honest boo
i would pay for air time just to vibe wit chu
kisses and hugs till the next time you swing thru



(So many things) So many thing that I wanna do
