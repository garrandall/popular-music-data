I want to know
Just how you feel
Said-a I want to know
If what you feel is real

'Cause there is a reason, yeah
For the things that I say
I want to love you, girl
In a special way

We've been together
For so very long
I would hate to break up
Break up our happy home

The way we stand and the way we lie
The way we love and the way we cry
Of all these things there lies a tie
Makes me feel that it's worth a try
I'll be good to you

Good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you

'Cause there is a reason
For the things that I say
I wanna love you, girl
In a special way

We've been together
For so very long
I would hate to break up
Break up our happy home

Take a step now, and let me know how
All of your ways, girl
And all your know-hows
I'll be good to you

Good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you

Good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you

Good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you

Good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you

Good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you
