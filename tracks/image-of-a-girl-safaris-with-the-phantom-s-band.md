As I lie awake resting from the day
I can hear the clock passing time away
Oh, I couldn't sleep, for on my mind
Was the image of the girl I hope to find

I look straight up at the ceiling above
Thinking of the girl whom I will love
Oh, would it be soon when she exists?
The image of the girl I've always wished

I twisted and I turned, oh, trying to sleep
But all I could do was only to weep
For I haven't found that image yet
Of all the girls that I have met

And now the clock is still passing time
And I know someday that she will be mine
And I know she'll always bring me love
For she's the image of the girl I love
