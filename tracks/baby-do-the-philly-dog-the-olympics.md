Stand up, and kick off your shoes
Let your hair down, get in the grove
Head shakin', finger boppin', lookin' fine
Come on baby, let me see you try

Philly dog (baby, do the philly dog)
Hey, now baby (baby, do the philly dog)
It's alright (baby, do the philly dog)
I know you can do it now

(Yeah, alright, ha ha, grove)
Yeah, ain't a grove
(Feelin it, yeah, ha ha hey)
Rrr, look at the children's head move

It spread from east to west (oh philly dog)
My baby can do it best
Earth shakin', back breakin', lookin' cool (oh philly dog)
Oh, I like the way you move

Philly dog (baby, do the philly dog)
Hey, now, baby (baby, do the philly dog)
It's alright (baby, do the philly dog)
I know you can do it now

(Yeah, that's right, ha ha ha)
Yeah, ain't a grove
(Yeah, ah, ha ha ha)
Dig this children's head move

Ah, hit me man

Come on, plan' boy and do it too (oh philly dog)
You dig the barefoot and boogaloo
Look at Fanny gettin' in the grove (oh philly dog)
If they can do it, so can you

Philly dog (baby, do the philly dog)
Hey, now, baby (baby, do the philly dog)
It's alright, now (baby, do the philly dog)
I know you can do it now

(Yeah, alright, woo ha)
Yeah, ain't a grove
(Yeah, boy, ha)
Dig this children's head move

Co' o' go (baby, do the philly dog)
Oh, woah, come on (baby, do the philly dog)
Woah, way to 'Frisco (baby, do the philly dog)
Don't forget L.A. (baby, do the philly dog)
Every day (baby, do the philly dog)
Hey, Culver City (baby, do the philly dog)
Ah, New York
