Make it last
Make it last forever (Ever)
Don't let end our love end (Oh...oh..)
(Oh...oh...oh.oh...)
Let's make it last (Oh...oh...oh.oh...)
Let's make it last forever and ever
Don't our let our love end (Oh...don't let love end), mmm

Let me hear you tell me you love me
Let me hear you say you'll never leave me
Oh, girl, that would make me feel so right
Let me hear you tell me you want me
Let me hear you say you'll never leave me, baby
Until the morning light (I)

Let me tell you how much I love you
Let me tell you that I really need you
Baby, baby, baby, I will make it all right
No one but you, baby
Can make me feel
The way you make me, make me, make me feel

Whoa...oh...oh...oh...oh...oh...
Mmm...mmm...mmm
Don't let our love end (Don't)
Just make it last forever (Oh, make it last) and ever (Forever)

Your touch is wonderful
Your love is so marvelous
Joy, that's what I feel
When I'm with you

Nothing, no one (No one, boy)
Could compare to what we have (Hell, no, baby)
Love, it feels so good
I'm so glad you're mine (Oh...oh...)

Whoa...oh...oh...oh...oh...oh... (Oh, baby)
Make it last forever (Oh...oh...oh.)
Know that I love it (No, no, no, no, no, no)
Make it last forever and ever (Yeah, yeah)

Oh, give me kisses (Kisses)
Love me (Love me), hold me (Hold me)
Squeeze me (Squeeze me)
Chillin' (Chillin'), come on (Come on)
I love you (You know I do), baby

Whoa...oh...oh...oh...oh...oh...
Mmm...mmm...mmm
Make it last forever (No, no, no, no, no, no)
Don't let our love end (And ever)

Whoa...oh...oh...ho...oh... (No, don't you let it end)
You got to make it last
Never, never, never let it end
Just make it last forever (I loved to) and ever (Woo, oh)

I want our love to last a lifetime (I'd give it up, give it up for you)
Oh, tell me, tell me you'll always be mine
(I love you, love you, love you, love you, love you)
To make love forever and ever (Oh)
We've got to make it last
Got to make it, got to make it, got to make (Ho...oh...), got to make it, oh, baby
Oh, honey (Oh, honey)
I love you (I love you)
Oh, you're the best thing in my world
The only thing in the world, I love you so
