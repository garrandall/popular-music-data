Well, I know there's peace on the mountain 
And that's where I want to go 
But I just can't rest on the mountaintop 
Knowin' the trouble down here below 
Whoa, trouble down here below 
Well, I know how to make it to the top of the mountain 
'Cause I've been there a time or so 
But I cannot rest on the mountaintop 
Knowin' the trouble down here below 
Yeah, yeah, trouble down here below 
I got a mother, father, sister, brothers 
Cryin' down here in a world of trouble 
Well, there ain't no trouble on the mountain 
But there's trouble down here below 
Yeah, yeah, trouble down here below 
Now people drinkin' and gamblin', rovin' and ramblin' 
Fightin' and shootin', yeah, they're a hatin' and disputin' 
No Lord, there ain't no trouble on the mountain 
But there's trouble down here below 
Hey, yeah, trouble down here below 
There's trouble down here, trouble down here 
My brothers and sisters are cryin' in a world of trouble 
I can't have no peace on the mountaintop 
'Cause I'm a worried and I'm troubled 
No Lord, there ain't no trouble on the mountain 
But there's trouble down here below 
Whoa, trouble down here below 
'Cause there's trouble down here below
