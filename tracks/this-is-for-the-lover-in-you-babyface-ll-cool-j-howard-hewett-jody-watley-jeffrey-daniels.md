Check it
Word is bond
Yeah, Face

I will love you any way, baby
Any way and every way I can
'Cause I'm that kind of man, yes

I will give you everything, baby
Give you more than any girl can stand
I'm gonna love you baby, baby, baby, baby

I'm talking 'bout makin' love in the shower at least an hour
And let you dangle in my arms 'cause love is power
Can you feel it? The sky's the limit once you reveal it
Your heart was wounded, God sent me to heal it

On a mission, ain't no stress, love
Touch you with precision, just undress, love
I know the right position, come on, trust me girl
Throw this rock up on your hand, I'll give you the world

Hey yo, Face
On the real
Was the honey looking laced
Oh, baby baby baby

This is for the lover in you
This ring means I'll always be true
This is how we'll start love anew
This time it's gonna last forever

I will love you all the way, baby
Girl that means this love will never end
I'll be your lover and your friend

I will take you anywhere, baby
Just say when and girl I'll take you there
I'm gonna take you baby, baby, baby, baby

We're going from Tahiti to France, to Italy in one night
Drop top Bentley coupe parked in the spotlight
And you can drive it laced in all white
I'm wearin' triple black, our gear is top flight

Trips to Venice, the man of steel when I'm in this
A match made in heaven when we blend this
Lovers everlasting, in other words endless
To love any other man would be senseless

Hey yo, Face
On the real
Was the honey looking laced
Oh, baby baby baby

This is for the lover in you
This ring means I'll always be true
This is how we'll start love anew
This time it's gonna last forever

Ladies and gentlemen, Howard Hewett

I can say I never met a girl, no no
Who satisfied my mental and physical thing
When I lay me down to sleep, I rest assured
With the thought that you are right, right next to me

This is for the lover in you
This ring means I'll always be true
This is how we'll start love anew
This time it's gonna last forever

It's for the lover in you, baby
With this ring I'll show you there ain't no maybe
It's for the lover in you, baby
This time it's gonna last forever

It's for the lover in you, baby
It's for the lover in you, baby
This time it's gonna last forever
