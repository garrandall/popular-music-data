If I knew what the
Nightingale sings in her song
If I knew why the meadow
Is sweet all day long

If I knew how the
Mockingbird trills to his dove
His sad sweet secret of love

Then I'd know how the
Mountaintop reaches so high
Then I'd know how the
Moonlight softens a sigh

Then I'd know how the
Ramblers bloom as they do
And at last, I'd know
The secret of you

Then I'd know how the
Ramblers bloom as they do
And at last, I'd know
The secret of you
