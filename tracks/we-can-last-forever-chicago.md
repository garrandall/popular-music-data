Don't turn away
Because there is something I just want to say
I need you to stay
Don't ask me why
Because I don't even know
How I gave you my heart, I gave it all to you
Now there's no way that I can lose


Every little look inside your eyes
Is all it takes to make me realize
We can last forever
With every little moment we can share
Going to let you know how much I care
I'll always be there


Don't walk away
Because there is something I just got to say:
I love you today
Just ask me why
You're all I'll ever need
Now that you're in my life
I really think you should know
That I never want to let you go


Every little look inside your eyes
Is all it takes to make me realize
We can last forever
With every little moment we can share
Going to let you know how much I care
Love lift us away
We can last forever
