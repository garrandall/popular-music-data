Oh, look out
Out of the way


You wanna be in my gang
My gang, my gang
You wanna be in my gang
Oh, yeah

You wanna be in my gang
My gang, my gang
You wanna be in my gang

I'm the leader, I'm the leader
I'm the leader of the gang, I am
I'm the leader, I'm the leader
I'm the one who put the bang in gang

I can take you higher than
A kite every single night
I can make you jump out of bed
Standing on your head

You better believe me
Come on, come on
Oh, you better believe me
Come on, come on
Yeah, you better believe me
Come on, come on

You wanna be in my gang
My gang, my gang
You wanna be in my gang
You wanna be in my gang
My gang, my gang
You wanna be in my gang

I'm the leader, I'm the leader
I'm the leader of the gang, I am
I'm the leader, I'm the leader
I'm the one who put the bang in gang

I can take you higher than
A kite every single night
I can make you jump out of bed
Standing on your head

You better believe me
Come on, come on
Well, you better believe me
Come on, come on
Now, you better believe me
Come on, come on



Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on

Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on

I said it
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on

Whoa, yeah
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on

Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on...
