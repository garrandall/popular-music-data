Welcome back
Your dreams were your ticket out
Welcome back to that same old place
That you laughed about

Well, the names have all changed
Since you hung around
But those dreams have remained
And they've turned around

Who'd have thought they'd lead you
(Who'd have thought they'd lead you)
Back here where we need you
(Back here where we need you)

Yeah, we tease him a lot
Cause we got him on the spot
Welcome back

Welcome back
Welcome back
Welcome back
Welcome back
Welcome back

Welcome back
We always could spot a friend
Welcome back
And I smile when I think
How you must have been

And I know what a scene
You were learning in
Was there something that
Made you come back again

And what could ever lead you
(What could ever lead you)
Back here where we need you
(Back here where we need you)

Yeah, we tease him a lot
Cause we got him on the spot
Welcome back

Welcome back
Welcome back
Welcome back
Welcome back
Welcome back

And I know what a scene
You were learning in
Was there something that
Made you come back again

And what could ever lead you
(What could ever lead you)
Back here where we need you
(Back here where we need you)

Yeah, we tease him a lot
Cause we got him on the spot
Welcome back

Welcome back
Welcome back
Welcome back
Welcome back
Welcome back

Yeah, we tease him a lot
Welcome back, welcome back
'Cause we got him on the spot
Welcome back, welcome back

Yeah, we tease him a lot
Cause we got him on the spot
Welcome back

Welcome back
Welcome back
Welcome back
Welcome back

Welcome back
Welcome back
Welcome back
Welcome back
Welcome back
