On the wings of a snow white dove
He sends his pure sweet love
A sign from above
On the wings of a dove

When troubles surround us, when evils come
The body grows weak, the spirit grows numb
When these things beset us,he doesn't forget us
He sends down his love
On the wings of a dove

On the wings of a snow white dove
He sends his pure sweet love
A sign from above
On the wings of a dove

When Noah had drifted on the flood many days
He searched for land in various ways
Troubles, he had some,but he wasn't forgotten
He sent him his love
On the wings of a dove

On the wings of a snow white dove
He sends his pure sweet love
A sign from above
On the wings of a dove

When Jesus went down to, the river that day
He was baptised in the usual way
And when it was done, God blessed his son
He sent him his love
On the wings of a dove

On the wings of a snow white dove
He sends his pure sweet love
A sign from above
On the wings of a dove
On the wings of a dove
On the wings of a dove
On the wings of a dove
