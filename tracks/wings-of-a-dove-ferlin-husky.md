On the wings of a snow white dove
He sends His pure sweet love
A sign from above (a sign from above)
On the wings of a dove

When trouble surrounds us, when evil comes
The body grows weak, the spirit grows numb
When these things beset us, God doesn't forget us
He sends down His love (sends down his love)
On the wings of a dove

On the wings of a snow white dove
He sends His pure sweet love
A sign from above (a sign from above)
On the wings of a dove

When Noah had drifted on the flood many days
He searched for land in various ways
Troubles, he had some, but was not forgotten
God sent down His love (sent down his love)
On the wings of a dove

On the wings of a snow white dove
He sends His pure sweet love
A sign from above (a sign from above)
On the wings of a dove

When Jesus went down to the water that day
He was baptized in the usual way
And when it was done, God blessed His Son
He sent down His love on the wings of a dove

On the wings of a snow white dove
He sends His pure sweet love
A sign from above (a sign from above)
On the wings of a dove

On the wings of a snow white dove
He sends His pure sweet love
A sign from above (a sign from above)
On the wings of a dove
