Not a soul up ahead
And nothing behind
There's a desert in my blood
And a storm in your eyes
Am I the king of nothing at all?
Then you're the queen of nothing at all

Well, I remember the fight
And I forget the pain
I got my hand in your pocket
And my key on your chain
Am I the king of nothing at all?
Then you're the queen of nothing at all


Oh, through the wilderness
You and I we're walking
Through the emptiness
Oh, my heart is a mess
Is it the only defense
Against the wilderness


Cross my heart
And hope to die
Taking this one step at a time
I got your back if you got mine
One foot in front of the other
All that we have is each other
One foot in front of the other


Not a soul in the road
Not a star in the sky
It's a desert in my heart
And I know where to hide
I'm your king of nothing at all
And you're my queen of nothing at all

Well, out here in the dust
If you don't have trust
Ain't nothing left of us
This is the exodus
They're just testing us
They can't flex with us
They can't mess with us
They can't mess with us


Oh, through the wilderness
How come even together
There can be loneliness?
Oh, our heart's a mess
But it's our only defense
To brave the wilderness


Cross my heart
And hope to die
Taking this one step at a time
I got your back if you got mine
One foot in front of the other
One foot in front of the other
All that we have is each other
One foot in front of the other
In the so-called land of the free
One foot in front of the other
All that we have is each other
One foot in front of the other
