Yeah
Oh where you at baby?
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, ugh, uh, uh
Uh, check it out

Baby, baby
Let's take our time (time)
Cause if we gonna do it
Might as well do it right (right)
Lock the doors
Turn off the phone (phone)
Shut the windows
Cause girl it's on (on)
All alone
But just me and you (you)
Four walls and an empty room, uh (room)
Squeeze you tight
And hold you close (close)
Kiss you where you know you need it most (most)

1 - I'm a really give you what you want
We can do whatever turns you on
I'm a make your fantasies
Become reality, for sure
I'm a really give you what you want
Show you how I flip it back to front
Tell me what you need from me
And I will guarantee, for sure

All we need
Is a place and time
Set the pace
And free our minds (minds)
Let it go
And let's explore (explore)
Every single thing that you wish for (for)
I only need a chance to make you feel me (feel me)
The closeness that we share is very real
I'm a lay back and let you choose
Cause what I'm giving you is just for you

Repeat 1

You feel my way
The seasons change
The fire and the flames
And my chance will come
You'll feel a rush
Of love, so come with me
I guess I'm meant to prove
So let me do my thing
I will take my time baby for sure
Hm

2 - Cut to the chase
Hit you up with the place
What you down with the blaze?
Go to extremes
Let it all be free
Where you at baby?
Travel miles
Drive out of town
So can't be found
Take things down
Baby if you loud
Gonna get it, get it, get it, get it, get it

Repeat 1
