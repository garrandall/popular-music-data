We're in trouble all the time you read about us all in the papers
We walk around and bump into walls a blind delegation yeah
And we ain't afraid of high power we're bullet proof
And we've never heard of Eisenhower missile power justice or truth
We're the department of youth your new department of youth
Ah ah we're the department of youth just me and youth
We talk about this whole stupid world and still come out laughing ha ha
We never make any sense but hell that never mattered
But we'll make it through our blackest hour we're living proof
And we've never heard of Billy Sunday Damon Runyon manners or Couth
We're the department of youth your new department of youth
Ah ah we're the department of youth just me and youth
We got department of youth the new department of youth
We got department of youth the new department of youth
We got department of youth ah ah we got the power
We got department of youth ah ah we got the power who's got the power we
We got department of youth ah ah we got the power who's got the power we
We got department of youth ah ah we got the power we got the power yeah
We got department of youth ah ah we got the power who gave it to you
Donny Osmond what we got department of youth ah ah we got the power
