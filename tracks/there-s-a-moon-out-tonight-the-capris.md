There's a (moon out tonight) whoa-oh-oh oh
Let's go strollin'
There's a (girl in my heart) whoa-oh-oh oh
Whose heart I've stolen
There's a moon out tonight (whoa-oh-oh oh)
Let's go strollin' through the park (oh-oh-oh-oh)

There's a (glow in my heart) whoa-oh-oh oh
I never felt before
There's a (girl at my side) whoa-oh-oh oh
That I adore
There's a glow in my heart I never felt before (oh-oh-oh-oh)

Oh darlin'
Where have you been?
I've been longin' for you all my life

Whoa-uh-oh baby I never felt this way before
I guess it's because there's a moon out tonight

There's a (glow in my heart) whoa-oh-oh oh
I never felt before
There's a (girl at my side) whoa-oh-oh oh
That I adore
There's glow in my heart
I guess it's because

There's a moon out tonight
Moon out tonight
Moon out tonight
Moon out tonight
There's a moon out tonight
