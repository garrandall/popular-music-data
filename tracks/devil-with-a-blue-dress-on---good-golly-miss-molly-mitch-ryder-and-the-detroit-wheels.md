Devil with the blue dress, blue dress, blue dress
Devil with the blue dress on
Devil with the blue dress, blue dress, blue dress
Devil with the blue dress on

Fee, fee, fi, fi, fo-fo, fum
Look at Molly now, here she comes
Wearin' her wig hat and shades to match
She's got high-heel shoes and an alligator hat

Wearin' her pearls and her diamond rings
She's got bracelets on her fingers now and everything
Devil with the blue dress, blue dress on
She's the Devil with the blue dress on, oh, everybody sing

Devil with the blue dress, blue dress on
Devil with the blue dress on

Wearin' her perfume, Chanel No. 5
Got to be the finest girl alive
She walks real cool, catches everybody's eye
She's got such good lovin' that they can't say goodbye

Not too skinny, she's not too fat
She's a real humdinger and I like it like that
Devil with the blue dress, blue dress on
She's the Devil with the blue dress on, hey, sing

Devil with the blue dress, blue dress, blue dress
The Devil with the blue dress on

Good golly Miss Molly
(Good golly, Miss Molly)
You sure like to ball
(Good golly, Miss Molly)

Good golly, Miss Molly
(Good golly, Miss Molly)
You sure like to ball
(Good golly, Miss Molly)

While you're rockin' and rollin'
(Good golly, Miss Molly)
Can't you hear your mama call
(Good golly, Miss Molly)

From the early, early mornin' 'til the early, early nights
See Miss Molly rockin' at the House of Blue Lights

Good golly, Miss Molly
(Good golly, Miss Molly)
You sure like to ball
(Good golly, Miss Molly)

While you're rockin' and rollin'
(Good golly, Miss Molly)
Can't you hear your mama call
(Good golly, Miss Molly)

Fee, fee, fi, fi, fo-fo, fum
I said, "Look at once again now, here she comes
Wearin' her wig hat and shades to match
She's got high-heel sneakers and an alligator hat

Wearin' her pearls and her diamond rings
She's got bracelets on her fingers now and everything"
Devil with the blue dress, blue dress on
She's the Devil with the blue dress on

Devil with the blue dress, blue dress, blue dress
Devil with the blue dress on
Devil with the blue dress, blue dress, blue dress
Devil with the blue dress on
