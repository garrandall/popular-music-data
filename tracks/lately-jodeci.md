Lately I've had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
But yet the thought of losing you been hanging
Around my mind
K-ci sing it

Far more frequently your wearing perfume
With you say the special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know never know


Oh I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my preminition misses
But what I really feel
My eyes wont let me hide
Cuz they always start to cry
Cuz this time could mean goodbye

Lately I've been staring in the mirror
And I'ts very slowly picking me apart
I've tried to tell myself I have no reason
With your heart

Now just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thought's your keeping
You just say nothing's changed

Well I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premenition misses
But what I really feel
My eyes wont let me hide
Cuz they always start to cry
Cuz this time could mean goodbye
