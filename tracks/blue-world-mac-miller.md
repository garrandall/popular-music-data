(It's a blue world)
(Without you)
(It's a blue world)
(Alone)

Yeah well, this mad world made me crazy
Might just turn around, do 180
I ain't politicking, I ain't kissing no babies
The Devil on my doorstep being so shady
Don't trip, we don't gotta let him in, don't trip

I let it go, but I never go with it

Yeah, OK cool as Fall weather
Fuck the bullshit, I'm here to make it all better
With a little music for you
I don't do enough for you
Without you it's the color blue, oh
Don't trip, I was in the city, they was talking that shit
Had the homies with me, all of a sudden they split
We ain't even worried, we just laughing, that's rich
You know how it goes, it ain't broke don't fix

Hey, one of these days we'll all get by
Don't be afraid, don't fall

Think I lost my mind, reality's so hard to find
When the Devil tryna call yo' line
Shit, I always shine even when the light dim
No, I ain't God but I'm feeling just like him, ohdon't trip
See I was in the whip riding, me and my bitch
We was listening to us, no one else, that's it
That's a flex, just a bit, let me talk my shit
Say my hand got bit

Yeah well, this mad world made me crazy
Might just turn around, do 180
I ain't politicking, I ain't kissing no babies
The Devil on my doorstep being so shady
Don't trip, we don't gotta let him in, don't trip

I let it go but I never go with it
Don't trip, don't trip, don't trip

Well, if you could see me now
Loving and holding it down
My mind it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes

Well, this mad world made me crazy
Might just turn around, do 180
I ain't politicking, I ain't kissing no babies
The Devil on my doorstep being so shady
Don't trip, we don't gotta let him in, don't trip

I let it go but I never go with it

Hey, one of these days we'll all get by
Don't be afraid, don't fall in line
