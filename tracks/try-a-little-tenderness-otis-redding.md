O, she may be weary
Them young girls, they do get weary
Wearin that same old shaggy dress
O, when she gets weary, try a little Tenderness
You know shes waiting, just anticipating
For the things she'll never posses
While she's there waiting
Try, o just a little, o just a little little little tenderness
That's what I said, a little tenderness

It's' All you gotta do
It's not, ha, oo just sentimental, no
She has, she has, she has
Her griefs and cares
But the soft words spoke so gentle, yea
And it makes it easier, easier
To bare

You won't regret it no
Them young girls, they don't forget it
Love is their own, their own, happiness
But it's all, it's all, so simple now
All you gotta do is try a little tenderness

Won't you show her won't her, won't you show her that you love her
You wanna squeeze her, don't tease her, neva leave her
You got want to want to just try a little tenderness

You gotta show her that you want it, now one above her now
Squeeze her, don't tease her, neva leave her
Hold her, grab her softly now
And try a little tenderness
You ota listen to me, don't leave
Don't cheat her now
Squeeze her, don't cheat her, neva leave her
Gotta show her na na na heeyyyyyy hey!
You got to know what to do, don't be a fool
You need to try this now
Just try a little tenderness
Take it from me you don't wanna let her leave
Squeeze her, don't tease, neva leave

You got to want to try, juss try, juss try, a little tenderness
Is there a witness in the building tonight
You gotta want to want to try, just try a little tenderness
Try a little tenderness
Squeeze her, don't tease her, neva leave her
Hold her, grab her softly now
Just try a little...
