You're beautiful, that's for sure
You'll never ever fade
You're lovely, but it's not for sure
That I won't ever change


And though my love is rare
Though my love is true


I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is (Soul is)
I don't know where my home is
And baby, all I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is (Soul is)
I don't know where my home is
All I need for you to know is


Your faith in me brings me to tears (Oh)
Even after all these years, years, years
And it pains me so much to tell
That you don't know me that well


And though my love is rare
Though my love is true


I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is (Soul is)
I don't know where my home is
And baby, all I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is (Soul is)
I don't know where my home is
And baby, all I need for you to know is


It's not that I wanna say goodbye
It's just that every time you try
To tell me, me that you love me (Oh-oh)
Each and every single day
I know I'm gonna have to eventually
Give you away


And though my love is rare, rare, rare
And though my love is true, yeah
Hey, I'm just scared
That we may fall through
Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah


I'm like a bird (I'm like a bird)
I don't know where my soul is (Soul is)
I don't know where my home is
And baby, all I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is (Soul is)
I don't know where my home is
And baby, all I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
(I don't know where my soul is)
I don't know where my soul is (Soul is)
(I don't know where my home is, oh)
I don't know where my home is
And baby, all I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
(I don't know where my soul is)
(I don't know where my home is)
I don't know where my soul is (Soul is)
I don't know where my home is
And baby, all I need for you to know is


I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is (Soul is)
I don't know where my home is
And baby, all I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is (Soul is)
I don't know where my home is
