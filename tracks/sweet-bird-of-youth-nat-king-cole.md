The sweet bird of youth soon flies away
And nothing can make him stay
The sweet bird of youth soothes us his sound
To waste precious time is wrong

So come to my arms
We're young but we'll learn
That lips unkissed like moments missed
Can never return

How sad is the truth
Try though we may
The sweet bird of youth flies away
The sweet bird of youth flies away
