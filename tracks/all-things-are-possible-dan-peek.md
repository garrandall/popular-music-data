When you turn misty blue
I have my eyes on you
The good things will come true
Just believe in your heart

There's nothing too much for you
With me there to help you through

All things are possible
With you by my side
All things are possible
With you to be my guide

And now the time has come
To put away those things that made you run
Keep your eye on the Son
And your feet on the path

(Repeat bridge and)

(Break)

(Repeat)
