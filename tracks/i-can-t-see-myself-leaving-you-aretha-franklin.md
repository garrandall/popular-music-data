You've been running around
This I know, yeah
I ought to pack my things
And let you go
But baby


I don't know what to do
I can't see myself
Going away to stay
Whoa, no, I can't see myself leaving you


You've been running around
With every girl in town
Yes, you have
If I just had the power
I'd put you right down
Whoa, oh, my love


I don't know what to do
Cause I can't see myself
Going away to stay
Oh no, I can't see myself leaving you, no


True love is so hard to find
Tell me, tell me that I've got mine
If I go searching for another
I'd just be wasting my time, yeah, hey


I say we're through
Because I love you
Yes, I do
If I leave you, baby
What would I do?
Whoa, oh, oh, my love


I wouldn't know what to do
'Cause I can't see myself leaving you
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
I can't see myself leaving you, no
I can't see myself leaving you


Whoa, no
I can't see myself leaving you, no
I can't see myself (I can't see myself)
Leaving you (I can't see myself)
Oh no (I can't see myself)
I can't see myself (I can't see myself)
Oh no (I can't see myself)
