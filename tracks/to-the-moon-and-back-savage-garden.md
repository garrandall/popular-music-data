She's taking her time making up
the reasons
To justify all the hurt inside
Guess she knows from the smile
and the look in their eyes
Everyone's got a theory about the
bitter one
They're saying, "Mamma never loved
her much"
And, "Daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away from
human affection"
But somewhere in a private place
She packs her bags for outer space
And now she's waiting for the right
kind of pilot to come
And she'll say to him
She's saying


I would fly to the moon & back if
you'll be...
If you'll be my baby
Got a ticket for a world where we
belong
So would you be my baby?

She can't remember a time when she
felt needed
If love was red then she was colour
blind
All her friends they've been tried for
treason
And crimes that were never defined
She's saying, "Love is like a barren
place,
And reaching out for human faith is
Is like a journey I just don't have a
map for"
So baby's gonna take a dive and
Push the shift to overdrive
Send a signal that she's hanging
All her hopes on the stars
What a pleasant dream
Just saying



(hold on... hold on...)

Mamma never loved her much
And Daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away from
human affection
But somewhere in a private place
She packs her bags for outer space
And now she's waiting for the right
kind of pilot to come
And she'll say to him
Just saying
