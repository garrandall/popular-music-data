Put on my continental suit
Put on my continental hat
Put on my continental shoes
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

(CHORUS)
Do the continental walk
Come on and do
The continental with me
We just slide, side by side
Follow me

Get in line, everybody
Round and round we go
One more time, everybody
Walking to and fro

Looking good like it should
Now we're doing the continental walk
Come on, come on, come on, and

(CHORUS)

Mom and dad are
Catching on to this bag
Cause it's a dance
That's so easy to do

I went around
To a hop in my town
And the jockey was doing it too

Get in line, everybody
Round and round we go
One more time, everybody
Walking to and fro

Looking good like it should
Now we're doing the continental walk
Come on, come on, come on, and

(CHORUS)

We just slide, side by side
Follow me
