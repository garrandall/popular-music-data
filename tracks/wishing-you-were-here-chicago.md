Sleepless hours and dreamless nights and far aways
Ooo oo oo, wishing you were here
Heaven knows and Lord it shows when I'm away
Ooo oo oo, wishing you were here

Ah ah...

Same old show in a different town on another day
Ooo oo oo, wishing you were here
Even though you're far away, you're on my mind
Ooo oo oo, wishing you were here

Ah ah...

And I'd like to change my life, and you know I would
Just to be with you tonight, baby, if I could
But I've got my job to do, and I do it well
(Change my life, change my life)
So I guess that's how it is

Ooo oo oo, wishing you were here
Ooo oo oo, wishing you were here ...

On the road it's a heavy load, but I'll be by
Ooo oo oo, wishing you were here
Pay the price, make a sacrifice, and still I'll try
Ooo oo oo, wishing you were here
