I've got the power

Like the crack of the whip, I Snap attack
Front to back, in this thing called rap
Dig it like a cymbal, rhyme devil on the heavenly level
Bang the bass, turn up the treble
Radical mind, day and night all the time
7:14, wise, divine
Maniac brainiac, winnin' the game
I'm the lyrical Jesse James

It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda heavy
It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda heavy
It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda heavy

I've got the power

He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts

I've got the power

He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts

I've got the power

It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda hectic

Quality I possess and say I'm fresh
When my voice goes through the mesh
Of the microphone, that I am holding
Copy written lyrics, so they can't be stolen
If they all Snap, don't need the police
To try to save them, your voice will cease
So peace, stay off my back
Or I will attack and you don't want that

I've got the power
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts

I've got the power

I've got the power
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts

I've got the power

Quality I possess, and say I'm fresh
When my voice goes through the mesh
Of the microphone, that I am holding
Copy written lyrics, so they can't be stolen
If they all Snap, don't need the police
To try to save them, your voice don't see
So peace, stay off my back
Or I will attack and you don't want that

I've got the power
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts

I've got the power
I've got the power
