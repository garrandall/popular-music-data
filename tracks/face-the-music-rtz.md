I can't blame you
Nobody wants to be the fool
Face the music
It's all there in front of you
You can get it if you really try
You can get it if you don't ask why

Look at you
The life you've gotten used to
You don't care about
The things you're into
You can get it
'Cause it's everywhere
Temptation hides
Behind every stare
And when you get it
It makes you feel good
You don't regret it
But maybe you should

Just face the music
Or turn away
Just face the music
You can run or stay

First you'll admit it
Then you take it back
You're looking good
'Cause that's your act
Look at you
Your life's getting hollow
Time to choose
The path you're gonna follow

And when you get it
It makes you feel good
You don't regret it
But maybe you should

Just face the music
Or turn away
Just face the music
You can run or stay

Face the music
Or turn away
Just face the music
You can run or stay

I can't blame you
Nobody wants to be the fool
Face the music
It's all there in front of you

And when you get it
It makes you feel good
You don't regret it
But maybe you should

Just face the music
Or turn away
Just face the music
You can run or stay

Whoa-oa, face the music
Or turn away
Just face the music
You can run or stay

(Face the music)
You can run or stay
