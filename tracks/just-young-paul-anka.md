When they see us
Walking home together
And we're holding hands
Along the way

They'll say it's just
Because we're young
Just young

When they see your
Picture on my bureau
And they see me
Kiss it every day

They'll say it's just
Because we're young
Just young

Just young (just young)
But it isn't the way we feel
Our hearts (our hearts)
Tell us our love is real
(Our love is real)

Til the time we make
Them understand us
Secretly, we'll smile up
At the way they say

It's just because
We're young, just young

They'll say it's just
Because we're young
Just young

Just young (just young)
But it isn't the way we feel
Our hearts (our hearts)
Tell us our love is real
(Our love is real)

Til the time we make
Them understand us
Secretly, we'll smile up
At the way they say

It's just because
We're young, just young

Just young, just young
Just young, just young...
