I hate to say it but I told you so
Don't mind my preaching to you
I said "Don't trust him", baby, now you know
You don't learn everything there is to know in school

Wouldn't believe me when I gave advice
I said that he was a tease
If you want help you better ask me nice
So be sincere, convince me with a "pretty please"

Laugh, laugh, I thought I'd die
It seemed so funny to me
Laugh, laugh, you met a guy
Who taught you how it feels to be

Lonely, oh so lonely

Don't think I'm being funny when I say
You got just what you deserve
I can't help feeling you found out today
You thought you were too good; you had a lot of nerve

Won't say I'm sorry for the things I said
I'm glad he packed up to go
You kept on bragging he was yours instead
Found you don't know everything there is to know

Laugh, laugh, I thought I'd die
It seemed so funny to me
Laugh, laugh, you met a guy
Who taught you how it feels to be

Lonely, oh so lonely

Before I go I'd like to say one thing
Don't close your ears to me
Take my advice and you'll find out that being
Just another girl won't cause you misery

Don't say you can get any boy at your call
Don't be so smug or else
You'll find you can't get any boy at all
You'll wind up an old lady sitting on the shelf

Laugh, laugh, I thought I'd die
It seemed so funny to me
Laugh, laugh, you met a guy
Who taught you how it feels to be

Lonely, oh so lonely
