I'm counting the days since I began to live without you
I'm covered in rain but it feels just like its the sun
And it don't get me down, don't come around
Your better of leaving town
I'm fine here alone now without you

Hey! I'm screaming at you!
Hey! Don't care enough to write you a letter,
Now that I'm doing better alone
Hey! I'm screaming at you!
Hey! Don't care enough to write you a letter,
Now that I'm doing better better off without you

Your stuck in a world of make believe and I can see it
I gave it a chance, you must be crazy not to leave
Never gonna bring me down, don't come around
Your better of leaving town
I'm fine here alone now without you

Hey! I'm screaming at you!
Hey! Don't care enough to write you a letter,
Now that I'm doing better alone
Hey! I'm screaming at you!
Hey! Don't care enough to write you a letter,
Now that I'm doing better better off without you

I'm giving it up now your taking it away
All of the time now get away
You never been lost with anyone its me they want without you its not the same
So hear me now screaming out you name

Hey! I'm screaming at you!
Hey! Don't care enough to write you a letter,
Now that I'm doing better alone
Hey! I'm screaming at you!
Hey! Don't care enough to write you a letter,
Now that I'm doing better better off without you

Better off without you, better off without you

Hey! I'm screaming at you!
Hey! Don't care enough to write you a letter
Now that I'm doing better better off without you. . .
