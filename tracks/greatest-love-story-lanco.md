They said I was nothing but a trouble maker never up to no good
You were the perfect all American girl wouldn't touch me even if you could
But you were sneaking out your window every night riding shotgun in my car
We'd go to the river and find us a spot and we probably went a little too far
Just a little too far

Cause I was gonna be your forever and
You were gonna be my wife
We didn't know any better
Didn't have a clue about life
But I was what you wanted you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

So you went off to college and I got a job I was working at a 9 to 5
Dreaming of the days when you were in my arms I'd never felt so alive
I'd spend my days working, spend my nights drinking, howling at the moon
Screaming for the days when you were coming back no couldn't come too soon
Couldn't come too soon

When I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
But you went off to find better
And I was learning all about life
But I was what you wanted and you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

So you came back after a long four years
Your college boyfriend didn't work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now
Sure we changed but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me
I went to the store and bought you a ring and I got down on one knee
Down on one knee

And I said
I'm gonna be your forever
So baby will you be my wife
Now that we know a little better
We could have a real nice life
Cause I'm what you wanted and you're what I need
So let's meet in between
We are gonna be the greatest love story this town has ever seen
We are gonna be the greatest love story this world has ever seen
So baby say yes to me
