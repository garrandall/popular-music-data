Hey j-j-jaded, you got your mama's style 
But you're yesterday's child to me
So jaded
You think that's where it's at 
But is that where it's supposed to be
You're gettin' it all over me and serrated 

My my baby blue 
Yeah I been thinkin' about you
My my baby blue
Yeah you're so jaded 
And I'm the one that jaded you

Hey j-j-jaded
In all it's misery 
It will always be what I love and hated
And maybe take a ride to the other side 
We're thinkin' of
We'll slip into the velvet glove 
And be jaded

My my baby blue
Yeah I'm thinkin about you
My my baby blue
Yeah I'm so jaded
And baby I'm afraid of you

Your thinking's so complicated
I've had it all up to here
But it's so overrated
Love and hated 
Wouldn't trade it
Love me jaded

Hey j-j-jaded
There ain't no baby please
When I'm shootin the breeze with her
When everything you see is a blur
And ectasy's what you prefer

My my baby blue
Yeah I'm talkin' about you
My my baby blue
Yeah I've been thinkin' about you
My my baby blue
Yeah you're so jaded
Baby 
Jaded
Baby 
You're so jaded
'Cause I'm the one that jaded you
