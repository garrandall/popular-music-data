If I could win your heart
If you'd let me in your heart
I'd be so happy, baby
Just for these arms to be
Holding you close to me
There's nothing in this world I won't try
No limit to what I'd do to make you mine, 'cause

I'd climb right up to the sky
I'd take down the stars
Just to be in your arms, baby
I'd go and capture the moon
That's what I would do
Just to hear you say that you love me
Just to hear you say that you love me

If I could taste your kiss
There'd be no sweeter gift
Heaven could offer baby
Oh, baby
I want to be the one
I want to be the one
Living to give you love
I'd walk across this world just to be
Close to you 'cause I want you close to me, yeah

I'd climb right up to the sky
I'd take down the stars
Just to be in your arms, baby
I'd go and capture the moon
That's what I would do
Just to hear you say that you love me
Just to hear you say that you love me

For the rest of your life
For the rest of your life
Love me for the rest of all time
Oh baby, baby
Just say the word
And I'll give you my world
There's nothing I won't do
Baby, just to be with you

I'd climb right up to the sky
I'd take down the stars
Just to be in your arms, baby
I'd go and capture the moon
That's what I would do
Just to hear you say that you love me
Just to hear you say that you love me
Just to hear you say that you love me, baby
Just to hear you say that you love me
Oh, I need to hear you say that you love me, baby
Just to hear you say that you love me
Just say you love me
Just say you need me

Just to hear you say that you love me
