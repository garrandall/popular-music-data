I want to drink that shot of whiskey
I want to smoke that cigarette
I want to smell that sweet addiction on my breath
I want to ride across West Virginia in the backseat of a Cadillac
You know some cowboys like me go out like that
So I need you


Like a needle needs a vein
Like my Uncle Joe in Oklahoma needs a rain
I need you like a lighthouse on the coast
Like the father and the son meet the holy ghost
I need you


I want to get lost in some corner booth
Cantina Mexico
I want to dance to the static of an a.m. radio
I want to wrap the moon around us and lay beside you skin on skin
Make love 'til the sun comes up til the sun goes down again
'Cause I need you


Like a needle needs a vein
Like my Uncle Joe in Oklahoma needs a rain
I need you like a lighthouse on the coast
Like the father and the son meet the holy ghost
I need you
Oh, I need you


I want to drink that shot of whiskey
I want to smoke that cigarette
You know some cowboys like me go out like that
So I need you, oh, I need you
I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you


Oh, I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you, I need you, too
