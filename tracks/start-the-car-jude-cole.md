Yeah, yeah, uh-huh
Well I'm tired of the pressure
So tired of the pace
Just wanna grab you baby
And get out of this place
I got no chance of making it
Working downtown
Just walking slow and talking low
And tired of going down, down, down
Start the car, we gotta move
This ain't no living, this ain't no groove
It's been a long hard road
Come on baby (oh baby)
Let's drive it home
Start the car
We started out for paradise
But this ain't no promised land
This ain't no kind of living for an honest working man
Well there's people dying on the streets
Sure don't make the news, ohyeah
While others living up on the hill
Singing the white boy blues
Whoa, start the car, we gotta move
This ain't no living (no living)
This ain't no groove
The city's rich, or dirt poor
But somewhere waiting (ohyeah)
There's something more
Start the car

Well we're going out with dignity
We're going out with style
Gonna lay down that hammer baby
Make our own road across the miles
'Cause I can't take this town one more day
Whoa, start the car, we gotta move
This ain't no living (no living)
This ain't no groove
The city's rich, or dirt poor
But somewhere waiting (somewhere waiting)
There's gotta be something more
Start the car, yeah
It's been a long hard road
Well come on baby, let's drive it home
Start the car
Oh start the car
Oh start the car
Oh start the car
Mabeline, why can't you be true
Start the car
