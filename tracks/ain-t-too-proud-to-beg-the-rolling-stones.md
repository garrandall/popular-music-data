I know you want to leave me
But I refuse to let you go
If I have to beg, plead for your sympathy
I don't mind because you mean that much to me


Ain't too proud to beg and you know it
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go


Now I heard a quiet man is half a man
With no sense of pride
But if I have to cry to keep you I don't mind weeping
If it will keep you by my side

If I have to sleep on your door step all night and day
Just to keep you from walking away
Let your friends laugh, even this I can stand
Because I want to keep you anywhere I can

Now I've got a love so deep in the pit of my heart
And each day it grows more and more
I'm not ashamed to come and plead with you, baby
If pleading keeps you from walking out the door
