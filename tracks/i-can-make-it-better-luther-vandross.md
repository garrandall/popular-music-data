Well, once again, my love
It's time for you to go
No need to explain anything
I know, I know, I know
This is the end of the road
It's the parting of the ways
And there's not much left for us to say

You keep telling me he's no good for you
You said you were gonna change your lock
You told me if he bothers you again, baby
He'll be dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Put him away, baby
Make him understand
Tell him his game is over
And then when you cry, I'll be your shoulder


Whatever you're going through
I can make it better
No one should be making you feel like you do
I can make it better
And oh baby, baby
Don't be a link in his chain
Tell him you want to be free, you want to love me
Don't let him get in the way, hey hey, yeah


For every one time that he gives you pleasure
Ten times he makes you wanna cry
You spend every night with the toss and the turn, baby
And wonder why in the world, oh why
How in the world can you get any sleep?
Everyone knows the way that he creeps
It's time for the question, baby
What has he done for you lately? So baby...


Whenever you want me to
I can make it better
I just need this one chance to prove it to you
I can make it better
And oh baby, baby
Don't be a pawn in his game
Go 'head and tell him it's over, tell him to go
Or darling, it's just a shame


Better for you is better for me
Let's fall in love, and I'll make you see, baby
Better for you is better for, better for me, baby
Let's fall in love, I'll make you, I'll make you see


Never again will you hear a lie
Never again will you wanna cry
Never, oh no, will there be a teardrop in your eye
Stop all this madness in the name of love
Tell him to leave 'cause enough is enough
Let him go, baby, and you can save your love for me
Tell him you've found somebody
Who'll give you the love that you just won't believe


Whatever you're going through
I can make it better
No one should be making you feel like you do
I can make it better
And oh baby, baby
Don't be a link in his chain
Go 'head and tell him it's over, tell him to go
Oh darling, it's just a shame

It's better for you, ooh, better for you
(I can make it better for you)
Better for you, so much better for you
(I can make it better, yeah, babe)
Better for you, yeah yeah, better for you
(I can make it better for you)
Better for you, hey, better for you
(I can make it better, yeah, babe)
Better for you, better for you
(I can make it better for you)
Better for you, better for you
(I can make it better, yeah, babe)
