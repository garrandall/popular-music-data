Three o'clock
In the morning
We danced the
Whole night through
And daylight soon
Will be dawning
Just one more
Waltz with you

I said the melody
It's so entrancing
It seems to be
Made for us two
I said that I
I could just keep
Right on dancing
Forever dear
Dancing here with you

It's three o'clock
In the morning
I say that we danced
The whole night through
And daylight soon
Will be dawning, yeah
There's a-one
More dance with you

I say that that melody
It's so, so entrancing, yeah
I could just go on and on
I said that I could
Just keep right on dancing
Forever dear
Dancing here with you

(Melody's so entrancing)
Melody's so entrancing
(Seems to be made for us two)
It seems to be made for us two

I could just keep right on
I could keep on dancing forever
Here, dancing here with you
Three o'clock in the morning
