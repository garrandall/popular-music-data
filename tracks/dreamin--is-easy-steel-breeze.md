You can call me at midnight
Cause I'll be waiting at home
And I'm impatient to answer

Got my hand on the phone
But it just doesnt ring
There's never any answer at all


Dreamin' is easy
But no one likes to dream alone
Dreamin' is easy
But no one likes to dream
No one likes to dream alone


I don't know how to reach you
If I could just break this spell
Do you think you could love me?

There's only one other way to tell
Every time I call
There's never any answer at all

When will you realize
I just won't go away
Not unless you say it from your heart

When will you realize
It could happen any day
Could it be like that from the start
