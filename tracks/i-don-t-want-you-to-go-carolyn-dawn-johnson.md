Monday morning is such a rush uh-uh uh yeah
Here it is again sneaking up on us uh-uh uh yeah
This is the part you know I don't like
We say goodbye and then we kiss goodnight uh-uh uh yeah
I know it's one o'clock and you said you would be gone by 10
So much for those 8 hours I swore that I'd get in

Chorus:
I know I should get some sleep
I am at the beginning of another long week
But I don't want you to go
No I don't want you to go
I guess another minute wouldn't do no harm
Why not spend it in each other's arms
Cuz I don't want you to go
No I don't want you to go

We always say just one more kiss uh-uh uh yeah, uh-uh uh yeah
But it always seems to never end like this uh-uh uh yeah, uh-uh uh yeah
A few dozen and a couple more
Before we know it its after 4
I know tomorrow my best friend will be my coffee cup
Cause here we go again watching the sun come up


I know tomorrow my best friend will be my coffee cup
Because here we go again
Watching the sun come up oh yeah
