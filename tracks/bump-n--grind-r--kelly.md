My mind's telling me no
But my body, my body's telling me yes

Baby - I don't wanna hurt nobody
But there is something, that I must confess - to you
(I don't see nothing wrong) oh...
(With a little bump, and grind) with a little bump, and grind
(I don't see nothing wrong) ba-baby - hey, I

(I don't see nothing wrong)
I don't see nothing wrong
(With a little bump, and grind) with a little bump, and grind
(I don't see nothing wrong) hey, oh... oh
(Lookie here)
See I know, just what you want

And I know, just what you need girl

So... (so baby, bring your body to me) hey, hey, hey... bring your body here

I'm not fooling around with you
Baby my love is true
With you - is where - I wanna be (with you, is where I wanna be)
Girl you need someone
Someone like me yeah

To satisfy, your every need

(I don't see nothing wrong) I don't see - I don't see nothing wrong
(With a little bump, and grind) with a little bump, and grind
(I don't see nothing wrong) baby - baby, I don't see...
(I don't see nothing wrong) I don't see...

(With a little bump, and grind) nothing wrong, with a little
(I don't see nothing wrong) bump, and grind - baby, hey

You say, he's not treating you right

Lady, spend the night
I'll... (I'll love you, like you need to be loved) girl won't you try, some of me

No need to look no more
Because I've opened up my doors
You'll never (you'll never, want another love)
You'll never find another me
You see you need someone, someone like me - yeah
To make love to you baby, constantly
(I don't see nothing wrong) I don't see - hey, nothing wrong
(With a little bump, and grind) with a little bump and
(I don't see nothing wrong) grind - oh, oh...
(I don't see nothing wrong) I don't see - nothing wrong
