My mind's telling me no
But my body, my body's telling me yes
No, I don't wanna hurt nobody
I said I don't wanna hurt nobody
But there is something, that I
Must confess

Sing
I don't see nothing wrong (Wrong)
Oh with a little bump n' grind
I don't see nothing wrong (Wrong)
(I can't hear you sing along
Let's get a little bit louder
MiC LOWRY say)
I don't see nothing wrong (Wrong)
(I don't see) With a little bump n' grind
I don't see nothing wrong (Wrong)

Said I know just what you want
And I know just what you need, girl
(Baby bring your body to me)
Bring your body, baby
I'm not fooling around with you
And baby my love is true
With you (Home is where I wanna be)
Is where, I wanna be
I said you need someone, someone like me yeah
To satisfy your every need

I don't see nothing wrong (Wrong) I don't see
With a little bump n' grind
(Nothing wrong with a little)
I don't see nothing wrong (Wrong)
(Oh, and I can't hear you sing along)
I don't see nothing wrong (Wrong)
(Sing it for me louder)
With a little bump n' grind
I don't see nothing wrong (Wrong)
(MiC LOWRY sing it louder, sing it louder
Sing it louder, sing it louder, no-oh)

You said, he's not treating you right
Lady, spend the night
I'll (I'll love you like you wanna be loved)
Girl won't you try some of me
No need to look no more
Because I've opened up my door
You'll never (Home is where I wanna be) Baby
And you'll never find another me

I said you need someone, someone like me, no
To make love to you, baby, constantly

I don't see nothing wrong (Wrong) I don't see
With a little bump n' grind
(Nothing wrong with a little)
I don't see nothing wrong (Wrong)
(MiC LOWRY sing it louder, sing it louder
Can you sing it louder, ooh)
I don't see nothing wrong (Wrong)
(I can't hear you)
With a little bump n' grind
(Yeah that's how I like it)
I don't see nothing wrong (Wrong)

There, there
Ain't nothing wrong
There, there
Ain't nothing wrong

I don't see nothing wrong (Wrong)
(Sing, I don't, I don't)
With a little bump n' grind
I don't see nothing wrong (Wrong)
(Baby, baby, baby, baby)
I don't see nothing wrong (Wrong)
(I don't, I don't)
With a little bump n' grind
I don't see nothing wrong (Wrong)
No I don't see nothing wrong
