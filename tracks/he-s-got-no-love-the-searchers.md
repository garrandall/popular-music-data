Sometimes a man might wanna cry
Sometimes a man might wanna die
He wonders why he's standin' all alone
It's 'cause he's got no love to call his own

Sometimes a man feels oh so sad
Sometimes a man is hurt so bad
He wonders why he's feelin' sad and cries
It's 'cause he's got no love to dry his eyes

He'd give the world to know someone who'd care for him
He hopes someday someone will share their love with him

Sometimes a man might wanna cry
Sometimes a man might wanna die
He wonders why he's feelin' sad inside
It's 'cause he's got no love to stand beside

He'll give the world to know someone who'd care for him
He hopes someday someone will share their love with him

Sometimes a man feels oh so sad
Sometimes a man is hurt so bad
He wonders why he's feelin' sad inside
It's 'cause he's got no love to stand beside

He's got no love, he's got no love, he's got no love
