I want a girl
I wanna girl who always has the time
To set my world & count the stars above
I want a girl
I wanna girl who still believes in love
Someone who's sensitive enough
I want a girl
Oh I wanna girl that I can really trust
Someone who's patient and who'll love me when it's rough
I want a girl
I wanna girl as smart as she is fine
Someone that I can say is mine

This girl I'm describing really does exist
Baby have you noticed

I want a girl like you
To be with me tonight
I wanna kiss your lips and hold you close
If thats alright
I want a girl like you
To keep me feeling new
I wanna make the words you say the most
"I love you"
And your love is all I'll ever need

I want a girl
A girl that makes me laugh
I want her sentimental
And to be my better half
I wanna girl like the one my father loves
And that's the one I'm dreaming of

Only one girl lives up to what's on my list
So you need to know this

I want a girl like you
To be with me tonight
I wanna kiss your lips and hold you close
If thats alright
I want a girl like you
To keep me feeling new
I wanna make the words you say the most
"I love you"
And your love is all I'll ever need

I want a girl like you
Yeah
I wanna kiss your lips and hold you close
If thats alright
I want a girl like you
To keep me new
I wanna make the words you say the most
"I love you"
And your love is all I'll ever need

"This should be played at high volume
Preferably in a residential area"

Only one girl lives up to what's on my list
So you need to know this baby

I want a
I want a girl if that's alright
I want a girl to hold me tight
I want ya baby if that's alright with you
I want a girl just like you
I want a girl who makes me do, do anything she wants me to
If that's alright with you

I want a girl that's patient
I want a girl that's kind
I just want you baby if that's alright with you
I want a girl who loves me
Who always has the time
I just need you baby, if that's alright with you

To keep me feeling new
I wanna make the words you say the most
"I love you"
And your love is all I'll ever need
