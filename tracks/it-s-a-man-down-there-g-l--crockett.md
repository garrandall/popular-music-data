Well, now you got me stranded, baby
Here on the second floor
You keep telling me, baby
I got to walk out that door

Uh uh, baby
Girl, I ain't walking out that door
Cause it's a man down there
Maybe your man, I don't know

I been knowing you, baby
Since you was a child
Since you got up and
Saw the bright lights
Girl, you're running wild

Uh uh, baby
Girl, I ain't going out that door
Cause it's a man down there
Maybe your man, I don't know

Well, now you pulled me up here, baby
Think it's a crying shame
You got me standing up here, baby
Looking down at your man

Uh uh, baby
Girl, I ain't going out that door
Cause it's a man down there
Maybe your man, how do I know

Now we came up here together
You want me to take the blame
I don't wanna stay here, baby
Face that other man

Uh uh, baby
Girl, I ain't going out that door
Cause it's a man down there
Maybe your man, I don't know

It's a man down there
Maybe your man, I don't know
It's a man down there
Maybe your man, how do I know
