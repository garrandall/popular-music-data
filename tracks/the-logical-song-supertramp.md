When I was young
It seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle, oh, it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees
Well, they'd be singing so happily
So joyfully, oh, playfully, watching me

Good morning!
Yeaaaaaah!
One, two... one, two, three, four!
Pump it up!

Aaaah! I ramp, me no ramp
Me no skin
Me no play, yeah
When me chant 'pon the microphone 
And me say with the DJ
Junglists in the place
Junglists on the case
Scooter, are you readyyy?

When I was young
It seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle, oh, it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees
Well, they'd be singing so happily
So joyfully, oh, playfully, watching me

Yeah!

When I was young
It seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle, oh, it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees
Well they'd be singing so happily
So joyfully, oh playfully, watching me

Come on!

Love, peace and unity
Siberia, the place to be
The K, the L, the F and the -ology
Hallelujah!

One, two... one, two, three, yeah!
Rough!
Aah!
Here we go!

When I was young
It seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees
Well, they'd be singing so happily
So joyfully, oh, playfully, watching me

Stand up!
Once again!
We're gettin' jiggy!
Siberiaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Yay!
Goodbye!
