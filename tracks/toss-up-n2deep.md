Late one night when I was creepin
And the rest of the world was sleepin
I got a beep from a little freak I met
At the mall, yes y'all, she was gettin the call
So I called, said: What's up, what's the deal?
You booty looked real good today
You know I'm ready to lay
(Some pipe) yeah, the N2Deep type
She said: Cool, bring someone from the crew
I said okay, picked up on my way
I woulda got but he was with some hoe
So it's just me and the dog and we're ready to gee
We picked the girl up and it was plain to see
That she was down to spin around and all that
Parked the ride and we jumped in the back
Huh, we got did and did, man, you know what's up
Straight yak, she's a toss-up

(Neighborhood)
(Neighborhood)
(Neighborhood)
(Neighborhood toss)
Toss-up

TL, wake that hoe up, man


Wake up, toss-up, you better call your boss up
Get up, wash up, dirty little toss-up
I'm in too deep and I'm still goin deeper
Not a straight peck redneck or a Crest creeper
Freak keeper, but only for a minute
Pull out ( ? ) 40 ounce and I'm up in it
Geein (Like that?) and I'm slingin thangs
Cause I'm pushin in Jimmy, then I'm pullin out James
10 gun salute to the man in the latex suit
(What's up?) This bud's for you
Straight dank man, goin up off 100 miles north of the V-Town
This shit'll have you towed down
Pull my lever and you felt the wrath
Honkey with a donkey that you know you can have
So let my super-duper ( ? ) rinky-dinky
Suck my pinky, stinky little toss-up

(Neighborhood)
(Neighborhood)
(Neighborhood)
(Neighborhood toss)
Toss-up


She's a toss-up, man, so I'm tossin her up
She look good and got a big old butt
(Is she a slut?) Yeah man, but I ain't callin her one
Not until (What's up? ) Until I get me some
(Dumb) girl, let me get in stride with you
Take a ride with you and get inside of you
(Who?) Me and my crew, like we always sdo
Don't try to say you ain't down because you know it ain't true
(I'm down) Turn off the lights and I'ma get under way
Straight strip and dip and no foreplay
Okay, so don't say that I'm gettin sprung
You didn't get no tongue, just a nut in your lung
From the young one, yeah, you know that's right
We ain't done yet, so turn off the lights
You see tonight, you're in for a treat
(You ain't gettin no sleep)
You're gettin busy with N2Deep
