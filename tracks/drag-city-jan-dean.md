Burn up that quarter mile

Just tuned my car, now she really peels
A lookin' real tough with chrome reverse wheels
A blue coral wax job sure looks pretty
Gonna get my chick and make it out to Drag City

Yeah, I'm goin' to Drag City
(Run her through now)
Goin' to Drag City
(What'll she do now?)

Goin' to Drag City
(Run her through now)
Goin' to Drag City
(What'll she do now?)

Burn up that quarter mile

The DJ's sayin' on my favorite station
(Whine, whine, whine)
The Drag City races are the fastest in the nation
(Listen to 'em whine, whine, whine)

Wheels are the wildest and the stockers are pretty
(Listen to 'em whine, whine, whine)
I'll get my honey, grab some money, split to Drag City
(Listen to 'em whine, whine, whine)

Well, I'm goin' to Drag City
(Run her through, now)
Goin' to Drag City
(What'll she do now)

Goin' to Drag City
(Run her through now)
Goin' to Drag City
(What'll she do now?)

Burn up that quarter mile

'Round the drag way thick exhaust fills the air
(Whine, whine, whine)
The final teams tachin' up and action everywhere
(Listen to 'em whine, whine, whine)

Checkered flags, wheel stands, sure sounds pretty
(Listen to 'em whine, whine, whine)
To hear the cheers bring your ears out to Drag City
(Listen to 'em whine, whine, whine)

Yeah, I'm goin' to Drag City
(Run her through, now)
Goin' to Drag City
(What'll she do now?)

Goin' to Drag City
(Run her through, now)
Goin' to Drag City
(What'll she do now?)

Burn up that quarter mile
Burn up that quarter mile

Listen to 'em whine
(Whine, whine, whine)
Listen to 'em whine
(Whine, whine, whine)

Listen to 'em whine
(Whine, whine, whine)
Listen to 'em whine
(Whine, whine, whine)

Listen to 'em whine
(Whine, whine, whine)
