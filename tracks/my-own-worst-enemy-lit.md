Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk?
I didn't mean to call you that
I can't remember what was said or what you threw at me
Please tell me


Please tell me why
My car is in the front yard
And I'm sleeping with my clothes on
I came in through the window last night
And you're gone, gone


It's no surprise to me, I am my own worst enemy
'Cause every now and then, I kick the living shit out of me
The smoke alarm is going off, and there's a cigarette
Still burning


Please tell me why
My car is in the front yard
And I'm sleeping with my clothes on
I came in through the window last night
And you're gone, gone


Please tell me why
My car is in the front yard
And I'm sleeping with my clothes on
I came in through the window last night


(Ah) It's no surprise to me, I am my own worst enemy (Ah)
'Cause every now and then, I kick the living shit out of me (Ah)
Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk? (Ah)
I didn't mean to call you that
