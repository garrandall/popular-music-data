You're waiting (you're waiting ...)
On miracles (on miracles ...)
We're bleeding out (bleeding out ...)

Thoughts (thoughts ...)
And prayers (and prayers ...)
Adorable (crisis ...)
Like cake in a crisis (in a crisis ...)
We're bleeding out (bleeding out ...)


While you deliberate
Bodies accumulate


Sit and talk like Jesus
Try walkin' like Jesus
Sit and talk like Jesus
Talk like Jesus
Talk talk talk talk
Get the fuck out of my way


Don’t be the problem, be the solution
Don’t be the problem, be the solution
Don’t be the problem, be the solution
Problem, problem, problem, problem

Faith without works is
Talk without works is
Faith without works is
Dead, dead, dead, dead


Sit and talk like Jesus
Try walkin' like Jesus
Sit and talk like Jesus
Try walkin' like Jesus
Try braving the rain
Try lifting the stone
Try extending a hand
Try walkin' your talk or get the fuck out of my way
