Frank, out on the street.Working late again.
You know you see much better at night.
They call you "Cat's Eye". Down on the corner, they call you "Mr. Flash".
The godsome ladies who never see the light.


And they'll work you when the day is through - on the Night Shift.
And they'll comfort you and they'll love you too - on the Night Shift.
"You won't ever want to see the sun when I'm done with you - You won't ever want to see the sun when I'm done with you" (done with you)

Hot shot, out on the street. Playing one on one.
You know you shoot much better at night.
You gotta Joker down on the corner and you can not be shamed.
You got some new tricks - you never show them the light.
