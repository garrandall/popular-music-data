Slippin' away, sittin' on a pillow
Waitin' for night to fall
A girl and a dream, sittin' on a pillow
This is the night to go to the celebrity ball

Satin and lace, isn't it a pity
Didn't find time to call
Ready or not, gonna make it to the city
This is the night to go to the celebrity ball

Dress up tonight, why be lonely?
You'll stay at home and you'll be alone
So why be lonely?
Sittin' alone, sittin' on a pillow
Waitin' to climb the walls
Maybe tonight, depending how your dream goes
She'll open her eyes when he goes to the celebrity ball

Celebrate, celebrate, dance to the music
Celebrate, celebrate, dance to the music
Celebrate, celebrate, dance to the music
