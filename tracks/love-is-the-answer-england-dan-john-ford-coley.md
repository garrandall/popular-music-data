There's no use in trying
To hold back the sea
We're talking in circles
About you and me
If we don't find an answer we'll both be alone
I just had to tell you 'fore the feeling is gone

You know we belong together
Hearts bound with love forever
You know we belong together
Yes we do, me and you

You say it's not easy
It's work all the time
You've run out of reasons
They're harder to find
But I was created to love only you
I'm feeling so helpless,
are you feeling it too?

You know we belong together
Hearts bound with love forever
You know we belong together
Yes we do, me and you

We've been here talking for an hour or more
Sharing space on the floor
It's a quarter to four
Maybe we'll know before the moon turns to night
That it's all gonna work out alright

You know we belong together
Hearts bound with love forever
You know we belong together
Yes we do, me and you
Yes we do, me and you
