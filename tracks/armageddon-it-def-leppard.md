Ya better come inside when you're ready to
But no chance if ya don't wanna dance
You like four letter words when you're ready to
But then you won't 'cos you know that you can

You got it, but are you gettin' it?

You say that love is won when you get some
But then your finger won't trigger the gun

You know you (ya) can't stop it
so don't rock it
You know you got it

Hey, but are you gettin' it?
really gettin' it?
Come get it from me

Gimme all of you lovin' - every little bit
Gimme all that you got - every bit of it
Every bit of your lovin - oh, c'mon live a bit
Never want it to stop

Yeah, but are you gettin' it? - Armageddon it!
Oh, really gettin' it? - Yes, Armaggedon it!

You try comin' on when you need some...
But then you don't 'cos you already did
Yeah, you jangle your jewels while your shakin' ya
And drive the pretty boys outta their heads

You got it, but are you gettin' it?

You flash your bedroom eyes like a jumpin' jack...
Then play it pretty with a pat on the back

You know you (ya) can't stop it
So don't rock it
You know you got it
Hey, but are you gettin' it?
Oh, really gettin' it?
Come get it from me





C'mon, Steve, get it


Take it, take it, take it from me
I got an itchy finger following me
Pull it, pull it, c'mon trigger the gun
'Cos the best is (a) yet to come, I say
'Cos the best is yet to come

Are you gettin' it? Really gettin' it?
Yes, are you gettin' it, really gettin' it?
Oh, come get it from me

Gimme all of you lovin' - every little bit
Gimme all that you got - every bit of it
Every bit of your lovin' - Oh come on live a bit
Never want it to stop - Oh, are you getting it?
Gimme all of your lovin' - Oh really gettin' it?
Gimme all that you got - Oh are you getting it?
Gimme all of your lovin' - Oh live a bit
Gimme all that you got - Whoa, live a bit

You've got to live it - gimme all of your lovin'
Oh baby live it - gimme all that you got
C'mon and give it - every bit of your lovin'
Oh come on and give it - Never want it to stop
Oh are you gettin' it? - Gimme all of your lovin'
Oh really gettin' it? - Gimme all that you got
Oh are you gettin' it? - Every bit of your lovin'
Oh live a bit - Never want it to stop
