I pass him by,
But I'm kind of shy
And I can't say hello,
But I should try
He is just the kind of guy
I'd like to know.
I want to meet him
I want to meet him
I keep thinking of him,
And I know I could love him,
Know that he's got to be mine
Yes I want to meet him.
I want to meet him.

He doesn't see
What he means to me
Cause I don't let it show,
The way I feel if I
Only could reveal
And let him know.
I want to meet him,
I want to meet him.
I keep thinking of him
And I know I could love him
Know that he's got to be mine.
I gotta meet him
I gotta meet him.

I can't let him go
Cause he's got to know
That I'm gonna love him so,
I gotta meet him

I want to meet him
Yes I gotta meet him
