Your hand is like a torch, each time you touch me
The look in your eyes pulls me apart
Don't open the door to heaven if I can't come in
Don't touch me if you don't love me, sweetheart

Your kiss is like a drink when I'm thirsty
And I'm thirsty for you with all my heart
But don't love me then act as though we've never kissed
Don't touch me if you don't love me, sweetheart

Don't give me something that you might take away
To have you then lose you wouldn't be smart on my part

Don't open the door to heaven if I can't come in
Don't touch me if you don't love me, sweetheart
No, don't touch me if you don't love me, sweetheart
