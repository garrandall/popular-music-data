Just about the time I think I've had it
Everything I've planned has fallen through
Just about the time the whole thing's crumblin' in
And I can't hold back no matter what I do
And just about the time I feel like screamin'
And findin' me a wall to punch right through
I look up and I just can't help smilin'
It's you

You're the only reason I'm still here, girl
You're the only one who keeps me sane
Somethin' `bout the way you've learned to calm me down
And see me through the anger and the pain
And just about the time I'm standin' on the edge
And searchin' for a light to see me through
I look up and I can see it shinin'
It's you

I don't really claim to understand it
I just know the way you make me feel
No one has to tell me I'm a lucky man
No one has to tell me that it's real

And just about the time I think I've lost it
I'm lookin' for a hole to crawl into
I look up and I just can't believe it
It's you
It's you

I look up
And honey, it's you
Gettin' me through
Keepin' it new
