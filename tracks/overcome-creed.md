Don’t cry victim to me
Everything we are and used to be
Is buried and gone
Now it’s my turn to speak
It’s my turn to expose and
Release what’s been killing me
I’ll be damned fighting you
It’s impossible, impossible
Say goodbye, with no sympathy


I’m entitled to overcome
Completely stunned and numb
Knock me down, throw me to the floor
There’s no pain I can feel no more
I’m entitled to overcome
Overcome


Finally see what’s beneath
Everything I am and hope to be
Cannot be lost
I’ll be damned fighting you
You’re impossible, impossible
Say goodbye, with no sympathy


I’m entitled to overcome
Completely stunned and numb
Knock me down, throw me to the floor
There’s no pain I can feel no more
I’m entitled to overcome
Overcome
Overcome


You’ll never know what I was thinking before you came around
Take a step, take a breath, put your guard down
I cannot worry anymore of what you think of me
I may be crazy but I'm buried in your memory


I’m entitled to overcome
Completely stunned and numb
Knock me down, throw me to the floor
There’s no pain I can feel no more
I’m entitled to overcome
Completely stunned and numb
I’m entitled to overcome
Completely stunned and numb
I’m entitled to overcome


I may be crazy but I'm buried in your memory
