Donât cry victim to me
Everything we are and used to be
Is buried and gone
Now itâs my turn to speak
Itâs my turn to expose and
Release whatâs been killing me
Iâll be damned fighting you
Itâs impossible, impossible
Say goodbye, with no sympathy

Iâm entitled to overcome
Completely stunned and numb
Knock me down, throw me to the floor
Thereâs no pain I can feel no more
Iâm entitled to overcome,
Overcome

Finally see whatâs beneath
Everything I am and hope to be
Cannot be lost
Iâll be damned fighting you
Youâre impossible, impossible
Say goodbye, with no sympathy

Iâm entitled to overcome
Completely stunned and numb
Knock me down, throw me to the floor
Thereâs no pain I can feel no more
Iâm entitled to overcome.



Overcome

Overcome

Youâll never know what I was thinking before you came around
Take a step, take a breath, put your guard down
I cannot worry anymore of what you think of me
I may be crazy but I'm buried in your memory



Iâm entitled to overcome
Completely stunned and numb
Knock me down, throw me to the floor
Thereâs no pain I can feel no more (to feel no more)
Iâm entitled to overcome (to feel no more)
Completely stunned and numb (to feel no more)
Iâm entitled to overcome
Completely stunned and numb
Iâm entitled to overcome,

I may be crazy but I'm buried in your memory
