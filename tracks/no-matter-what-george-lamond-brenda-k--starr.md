Love can be so right
But things can go so wrong
The clouds come rolling in
Love may not last very long

But I know as for me
Our love will always be
'Cause what we share together
Can weather any storm

Ooh, I love you, girl
(I love you, girl)
We'll get through
I promise you

No matter what the world may do to us
No matter what may try to tear our love apart
It won't get through to us
We'll never change what's in our hearts
No matter what

Life can be so hard
The world can be so cold
And everybody says we won't last
But they don't know

That for my whole life through
I'll keep on loving you
You're such a part of me
I could never let you go

Ooh, I love you, boy
(I love you, boy)
We'll get through
I promise you

No matter what the world may do to us
No matter what may try to tear our love apart
It won't get through to us
We'll never change what's in our hearts
No matter what

You'll be my everything
As long as you are by my side
We'll rise above
We won't let anything ever come between our love
No matter what

We found a place where we can both be free, yeah
So safe and warm within each other's arms
No matter what
We're gonna be here for eternity, yeah
No matter where, No matter how
We know our love will still be strong

No matter what the world may do to us
No matter what may try to tear our love apart
It won't get through to us
We'll never change what's in our hearts
No matter what

You'll be my everything
As long as you are by my side
We'll rise above
We won't let anything ever come between our love
No matter what

The world may do to us
No matter what may try to tear our love apart
It won't get through to us
We'll never change what's in our hearts
No matter what

You'll be my everything
As long as you are by my side, we'll rise above
We won't let anything ever come between our love
No matter what
