Tall in the saddle, we spend Christmas Day, driving the cattle over snow sovered-plains
All of the good gifts given today, ours is the sky and the wide open range
Back in the cities they have different ways, football and eggnog and Christmas Parades
I'll take my saddle, I'll take the reins, It's Christmas for cowboys wide-open plains

A campfire for warmth as we stop for the night, the stars overhead are Christmas tree lights
The wind sings a hymn as we bow down to pray, It's Christmas for cowboys, wide-open plains

Tall in the saddle we spend Christmas Day, driving the cattle over snow-covered plains
All of the good gifts given today, ours is the sky and the wide open range
It's Christmas for cowboys, wide open plains
