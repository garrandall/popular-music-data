I Have heard all about Love Land
And all of its little charms
But I know I'll never get to Love Land
Unless I'm wrapped up in your arms
Got to take me with you
Baby please, take me with you

How I'd love to walk down that golden street
Hand-in-hand with you where all the lovers meet
Whoa, I'd love to go to Love Land with you

Pretty baby, 'Cause my love is true, I swear, I do

I have heard all about Love Land
And all of its youthful hearts
Well, loneliness just can't live there
And happiness is the answer
You've got to take me with you
Baby, got to take me with you, oh yeah

How I'd love to walk down that golden street
Hand-in-hand with you where all the lovers meet
How I'd love to go to Love Land with you, yeah

Oh, I'd like to walk with you down that golden street
Hand-in-hand with you where all the lovers meet
Oh, I'd love to go to Love Land, Love Land with you

I do, swear I do, my love is true
Take me with you, baby
Yeah, take me with you, baby yeah

Got to, got to, got to, got to
Got to take me by the hand
Tell me, tell me, tell me baby, I'm your lover man

Together we can go and where we'll stop, yeah
Everybody will know, got to take me with you
Got to take me with you
