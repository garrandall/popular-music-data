Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone, I'm-a goin' home
Oh, my baby, just-a wrote me a letter

I don't care how much money I gotta spend
Got to get back to my baby again
Lonely days are gone, I'm-a goin' home
Oh, my baby, just-a wrote me a letter

Well, she wrote me a letter
Said she couldn't live without me no more
Listen, mister, can't you see I got to get back
To my baby once-a more
Anyway, yeah!

Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane

Oh, my baby, just-a wrote me a letter

Well, she wrote me a letter
Said she couldn't live without me no more
Listen, mister, can't you see I got to get back
To my baby once-a more
Anyway, yeah!

Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone, I'm-a goin' home
Oh, my baby, just-a wrote me a letter
Oh, go, my baby, just-a wrote me a letter
