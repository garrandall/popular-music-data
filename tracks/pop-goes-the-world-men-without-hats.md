Johnny played guitar, Jenny played bass
Name of the band is The Human Race
Everybody tell me, have you heard
Pop goes the world

Jenny played keyboard, Johnny played drums
Called Little Baby and a big Bonhomme
Everybody tell me, have you heard
Pop goes the world

It goes something like this

Johnny and Jenny had a crazy dream
See their pictures in a magazine
Every little boy needs a girl
Pop goes the world

Jenny and Johnny getting smart, it seemed
Make more money on a movie screen
Every little nest needs a bird
Pop goes the world

One, two, three and four is five
Everybody here is a friend of mine
Whatever happened to the Duke of Earl
(Pop goes the world)

Six, seven, eight and nine is ten
Send Al Gunn to see the doctor (Ben)
Hey, what planet are we on (the third)
Pop goes the world

And every time I wonder where the world went wrong
End up lying on my face going ringy-dingy-ding-dong
And every time I wonder if the world is right
End up in some disco, dancing all night

Johnny played guitar, Jenny played bass
Name of the band is The Human Race
Everybody tell me have you heard
Pop goes the world

Johnny played guitar, Jenny played bass
Ain't nobody couldn't take their place
Everybody tell me have you heard
Pop goes the world
(Pop goes the world)
(Pop goes the world)
