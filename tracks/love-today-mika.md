Doom da da di da di
Doom da da di da di

Everybody's gonna love today, gonna love today, gonna love today
Everybody's gonna love today, gonna love today
Anyway you want to, anyway you've got to
Love love me, love love me, love love

I've been crying for so long
Fighting tears just to carry on
But nowâbut now it's gone away

Hey, girl, why can't you carry on
Is it 'cause you're just like your mother?
A little tight, like to tease for fun
Well, you ain't gonna tease no other
Gonna make you a lover

Everybody's gonna love today, love today, love today
Everybody's gonna love today
Anyway you want to, anyway you've got to
Love love me, love love me, love love

Girl in the blue with the big bust on, big bust on, big bust on
Wait 'til your momma and your papa's gone, papa's gone
Momma, momma, papa
Shock shock me, shock shock me, shock shock

I said everybody's gonna love today, gonna love today, gonna love today
I said, everybody's gonna love today, gonna love today
Anyway you want to, anyway you've got to
Love love me, love love me, love love

Carolina sits on ninety five
Give her a dollar and she'll make you smile
Hook her, book her, nook her, walk away!

Girl dresses like a kid for fun
Licks her lips like there's something on them
Tries to tell you life has just begun
But you know she's getting something other
Than the love from her mother

Everybody's gonna love today, love today, love today
Everybody's gonna love today
Anyway you want to, anyway you've got to
Love love me, love love me, love love

Girl in the blue with the big bust on, big bust on, big bust on
Wait 'til your momma and your papa's gone, papa's gone
Momma, momma, papa
Shock shock me, shock shock me, shock shock

I said, everybody's gonna love today, gonna love today, gonna love today
I said, everybody's gonna love today, gonna love today
Anyway you want to, anyway you've got to
Love love me, love love me, love love

Doom da da di da di
Doom da da di da di
Doom da da di da di
Doom da da di da di

Everybody's gonna love today, gonna love today, gonna love today
Everybody's gonna love today, gonna love today
Anyway you want to, anyway you've got to
Love love me, love love me, love love

Doom da da di da di
Doom da da di da di
Doom da da di da di
