Hey hey hey, what about me?
I've got some feelings on my mind, too
Hey hey hey, what about me?
I'd like to have a song to sing, too

Please let me in when you're singing your song
And I'll just sit quiet, I won't try to sing along
You've got the warmest place that I've ever found
Please let me in, and I won't make a sound



But, don't you ask me to give you a song
I won't know the words to use, I won't know where they belong
But if you give me one of yours, I will make it my own
And it would be the sweetest song that I have ever known



I'd like to have a song to sing, too.
