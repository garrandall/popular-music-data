You came up on me like a landslide
Once in a while I get taken like that and I like it
I've got a Thunderbird parked right outside
Give me a minute to finish this thing and we'll light it

In all this heat it's a job keepin' cool
And I could fry an egg on you

You came up on me like a landslide
Once in a while I get taken like that and I like it

You're gonna get what's comin'
You been asking for it two days running
You're gonna get what's comin'
You're gonna get what's comin'to you

I hope that you're half as intrepid as you make out
Often or not, but you never got what you asked for
Keep on pouring until you hear me shout
And turn up the sound if you want me to drive any faster

Caution went out when you walked in the room
If it never came back it would be too soon

You're gonna get what's comin
You been askin' for it two days runnin'
You're gonna get what's comin'
You're gonna get what's comin' to you

You came upon me like a landslide
Once in a while I get taken like that and I like it

You're gonna get what's comin'
You been askin' for it two days runnin'
You're gonna get what's comin'
You're gonna get what's comin' to you
