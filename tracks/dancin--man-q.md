Hey buddy, you ain't gonna make that chic
Just sitting and running your mouth
Gotta get up, gotta get that feeling
Gotta get up, get it on
Gotta get up, get the guitar reeling
Gotta get up, get it on
Put down that drink and do it right quick
'Cause dancing's what it's all about
Gotta get up, gotta get that feeling
Gotta get up, get it on
Gotta get up, get the guitar reeling
Gotta get up, get it on
Say don't you know I've got that news
Straight from the horse's mouth
You know they're doing this thing up north
But it's started way down south
Hey, dancin' man!
You can stop and go find all that you want
But you gotta get out of your seat yeah yeah yeah
Gotta get up, gotta get that feeling
Gotta get up, get it on
Gotta get up, get the guitar reeling
Gotta get up, get it on
All she wants is a dancin' man
He knows how to move them feet
Gotta get up, gotta get that feeling
Gotta get up, get it on
Gotta get up, get the guitar reeling
Gotta get up, get it on
How can you sit still when music's hot?
You gotta come up and move
Swear sometimes you're all nailed down
When you can't feel that groove
Hey, dancin' man!
Gotta get up, gotta get that feeling
Gotta get up, get it on
Gotta get up, get the guitar reeling
Gotta get up, get it on
All she wants is a dancin' man
All she needs is a dancin' man
All she wants is a dancin' man
