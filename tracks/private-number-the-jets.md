You got the key
My private number
Exclusively
There's no other half
For me

You're the combination
The secret word
That unlocked my door
Remedy to ease the pain
You're every thing that
I've been wishing for

You keep the smile on my face
My heart's in overdrive
But when did I last
Try to get inside
I've got nothing to say

And that's the wasted time
Just idle talking
May you never do mistakes
Love

I've got an unlisted telephone
So anytime
I hear it ring
It has to be you that's calling
Don't have to hide
Behind an answering machine

I'd like to feel you're in me
For making shadows in the night
And through the curtain lace
Your light has seen me
It shines bright as the sun

You always leave a trace
Of what I'm thinking
You'll always be my
Number one 'cause

Anytime you feel
That we should make a love connection
You'll never find a busy sign
The line is clear to my affection

Private number
Private number
Private number
