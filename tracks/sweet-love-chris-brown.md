Yeah (Yeah)
(Freak me, baby)
You ready? (Guess my name)
I don't think so (Brown)
Haha


Oh baby, let's get naked, just so we can make sweet love
All these sensations got me going crazy for you
Inside on top of you, grinding inside and out of you
Baby, I know what to do, baby, I know what to do
So come on, baby girl, let's just take our clothes off
Just so we can make sweet love


Girl, I want to know your body
T-T-T-T-Tonight is the night t-t-t-t-that I change your life, oh-whoa
Just let me control your body
G-Girl, you shy you wanna slow it down? (Down)
And you start screaming when I go downtown (Ow!)
Oh-oh baby, tell my why you're so excited (Oh)
You know I love it when you take it off (Baby, take it off)
So baby, go ahead and take it off tonight (Yeah)


Oh baby, let's get naked (Yeah), just so we can make sweet love
All these sensations got me going crazy for you
Inside on top of you, grinding inside and out of you
Baby, I know what to do, baby, I know what to do
So come on, baby girl, let's just take our clothes off
Just so we can make sweet love


And I'm making sweet love to you, baby
Go 'head and take it off, let's get naked
'Cause you I know love to turn you on
Girl, let's do it to your favorite song, yeah
With the candles lit and the lights low (L-L-Low)
Baby girl, I want for you to roll (R-R-Roll)
Just roll your hips and just grind on me, grind on me, grind on me, baby
And baby, don't get it confused
I'll do everything you want me to
Just as long as you get crazy
And just as soon as you get naked, making love


Oh baby, let's get naked (Yeah), just so we can make sweet love (Whoa)
All these sensations (Ooh) got me going crazy for you
Inside on top of you, grinding inside and out of you
Baby, I know what to do, baby, I know what to do
(And girl, I know what to do)
So come on, baby girl, let's just take our clothes off (Oh)
Just so we can make sweet love


Make sweet love
(Freak me, baby)
(Oh baby, let's get naked)
Sweet love (Freak me, baby)
(Just so we can make sweet love)
Sweet love (Freak me, baby)
(All these sensations)
Oh-oh (Freak me, baby)
(Got me going crazy for you)
(Baby, I know what to do)
