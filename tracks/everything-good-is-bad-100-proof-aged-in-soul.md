Seems like everything good is bad
And everything bad is good
Seems like everything good is bad
And everything bad is good

Your love is like the sweet
Forbidden fruit in life
I'm another woman's man
You're another man's wife

We both know the difference
Between right and wrong
Life is full of temptation
It's so hard to be strong



Doo doo doo doo...

When I kissed your lips
I made a big mistake
Your love's become a habit
A habit I can't break

In my heart, I lied
Whoa, but in my mind, I know
With you, I wanna be
With her, I still belong



Everything good is bad
Everything bad is good
Everything good is bad
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Everything bad is good

(I wanna justify it now)
Everything good is bad
Everything bad is good
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Everything that you wanna be
It's so wrong to society, woo
If there's a choice
Between silk and satin
They both feel good to me

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Everything good is bad
And everything bad is good
Seems like everything good is bad
And everything bad is good

Everything good is bad
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Everything bad is good
(I wanna justify it now)

Everything good is bad
(Don't you know, don't you know)
And everything bad is good
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Everything good is bad
Everything bad is good
(Everything, everything
Is everything, woo)

Everything good is bad...
