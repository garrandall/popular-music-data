Can you hear them?
They talk about us
Telling lies
Well, that's no surprise
Can you see them?
See right through them
They have a shield
No secrets to reveal


Doesn't matter what they say
In the jealous games people play
Our lips are sealed


There's a weapon
That we must use
In our defense
Silence
When you look at them
Look right through them
That's when they'll disappear
That's when we'll be feared


Doesn't matter what they say
In the jealous games people play
Our lips are sealed


Pay no mind to what they say
Doesn't matter anyway
Our lips are sealed


Hush, my darling
Don't you cry
Quiet, angel
Forget their lies


Can you hear them?
They talk about us
Telling lies
Well, that's no surprise
Can you see them?
See right through them
They have a shield
No secrets to reveal


Doesn't matter what they say
In the jealous games people play
Our lips are sealed


Pay no mind to what they say
Doesn't matter anyway
Our lips are sealed
Our lips are sealed
Oh our lips are sealed
