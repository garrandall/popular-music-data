Baby, baby
Baby don't leave me
Ooh, please don't leave me
All by myself


I've got this burning, burning, yearning
Feelin' inside me
Ooh, deep inside me
And it hurts so bad


You came into my heart
So tenderly
With a burning love
That stings like a bee


Now that I surrender
So helplessly
You now wanna leave
Ooh, you wanna leave me


Ooh, baby, baby
Where did our love go?
Ooh, don't you want me?
Don't you want me no more?
Ooh, baby


Baby, baby
Where did our love go
And all your promises
Of a love forever more


I've got this burning, burning, yearning
Feelin' inside me
Ooh, deep inside me
And it hurts so bad


Before you won my heart
You were a perfect guy
But now that you got me
You wanna leave me behind
(Baby, baby) ooh baby


Baby, baby
Baby don't leave me
Ooh, please don't leave me
All by myself


Ooh, baby, baby
Where did our love go?
