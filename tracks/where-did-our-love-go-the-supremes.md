Baby, baby
Baby don't leave me
Oh please don't leave me
All by myself


I've got this burning, burning, yearning
Feelin' inside me
Oh deep inside me
And it hurts so bad


You came into my heart
So tenderly
With a burning love
That stings like a bee


Now that I surrender
So helplessly
You now wanna leave
Oh you wanna leave me


Oh baby, baby
Where did our love go?
Oh don't you want me?
Don't you want me no more?
Oh baby


Baby, baby
Where did our love go
And all your promises
Of a love forever more


I've got this burning, burning, yearning
Feelin' inside me
Oh deep inside me
And it hurts so bad


Before you won my heart
You were a perfect guy
But now that you got me
You wanna leave me behind
(Baby, baby) oh baby


Baby, baby
Baby don't leave me
Oh please don't leave me
All by myself


Oh baby, baby
Where did our love go?
