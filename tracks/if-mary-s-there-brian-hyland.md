I won't be there if Mary's there
I'm still in love with her
I couldn't bear to see her there
I'd be alone and blue
She'd be with someone new
Without a care
I won't be there if Mary's there
I love her too much
We'd be but just a kiss away
And never ever touch

It isn't fair to ask me there
I know I'll only cry
I won't be there if Mary's there
I'll love her till I die

I couldn't bear to see her there
I'll only cry
No I won't be there if Mary's there
I'll love her till I die
