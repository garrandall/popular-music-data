(Angel baby you're mine forever)
(Angel baby, you angel baby you)
Who is the dream who starts me dreaming
Angel baby
Then keeps me worrying and schemeing
You, angel baby, you

Who starts me walking 'round in clover
Angel baby
Then flips my crazy heart right over
You, angel baby, you

Who is the chick I would pick as the absolutely perfect miss for me to kiss
Who is the girl who can curl me around her finger when we kiss again
Who can imagine what I'd give for Angel baby
Just for the chance to love and live for
You, angel baby, you

(Angel baby) you're mine forever
(Angel baby) you, angel baby, you
(Who is the chick he would pick as the absolutely perfect miss for him to kiss)
(Who is the girl who can twirl him around her little finger when they kiss again)

Who can imagine what I'd give for Angel baby
Just for the chance to love and live for
You, angel baby, you
(Angel baby) you're mine forever
(Angel baby) you, angel baby, you
