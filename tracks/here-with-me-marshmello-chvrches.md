Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
And I need you here with me

When you lift me up I know that I'll never fall
I can speak to you by saying nothing at all
Every single time I find it harder to breathe
'Cause I need you here with me

Everyday
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me

Everyday
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me

I think I see your face in every place that I go
I try to hide it but I know that it's gonna show
Every single night I find it harder to sleep
'Cause I need you here with me

Everyday
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me

Everyday
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me

Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
'Cause I need you here with me
