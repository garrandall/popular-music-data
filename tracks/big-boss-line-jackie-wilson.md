Ooowwwww

Hey everybody, I feel so fine
Get yourself together
and form a big boss line
Got to move, dig the beat
Come on now baby, move your feet

You know that I feel a thrill
In the big, big boss line
Hey! I feel a thrill
Up and down my spine
Everytime I get the feelin’ little children
It make me wanna form a big boss line
I wanna shake it to the left
I wanna shake it to the right
Shake it all day, woman
Think I’ll shake it all night

And you know that I feel a thrill
In the big, big boss line
Hey! like the other night
I went to a dance
Everyone was workin’ it out
This I could tell at a glance
Huh! There were some doin’ the monkey
And some doin’ the twist
Man, with that crazy beat
Tell me how could they miss

And you know that I feel a thrill
In the big, big boss line
Hey! Everyone was there
I was out on the floor
Just a-workin’ it out, mama
Like you ain’t never seen before
And the band was playin’
Such a crazy beat
You’d have to be an iron man honey
Not to move your feet

And you know that I feel a thrill
In the big, big boss line
Hey Hey yeah!
Feel all right
Feel all right baby
Feel all right
Shake it up now baby
Shake it up my baby
Hey! Baby
I feel all right
Work it out my mama
Work it out my baby
Owwwwww work it
Work it out baby
