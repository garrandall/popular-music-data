You think youâre ballin cause you got a block?
He think he ballin cause he got a block?
You know these hoes came to see me ball
You know these hoes love to see me ball

You think youâre ballin cause you got a block?
He think he ballin cause he got a block?
You know these hoes love to see me ball
You know these hoes came to see me ball


Hopped up out the bed, I think my roof gone
Think I forgot to put my roof on
Said âfuck it, buy another carâ
Hopped out the Lambâ
Said âfuck it, bought another carâ
I bought the Phantom just to say itâs black
I bought the Phantom just to take a nap
Iâm getting head in the backseat
I might stop and stand it tall like a athlete
Iâm ballinâ hard, I need a jersey on
So much bread on me, I can buy a Jersey home
Iâm on them Diddyâs, spendinâ Dirty Money
Iâm on that Jizzle, spendinâ my money




Still ballinâ like a muthafucker, tell âem that
Three platinum chains to match my platinum plaques
Ainât got nuttinâ gold but some gold chains
Say âJizzle, whatâs the dough?â
Move the whole thang
My celly bumpinâ like a chat line
He bought a 500, need he, need a halftime
If yo job ainât ballinâ hard, then you need to quit
You need a A T hard, then you need to split
Summerâs mine, winter too
Iâm poppinâ bottles in the club, thatâs what winners do
They claiming bitches, them my old hoes
They claim they ballinâ in my old flows




These hoes call me Tunechi baby
Niggas think they seeing me, they hallucinating
Bitch, Iâm ballinâ, ballinâ like a muthafucker
12 gauge, bitch, I got a dozen of them
Nigga broke, acting like he got it though
Iâm with a Spanish bitch, if she ain't fucking, adios!
So many cars Iâm like eenie meenie minie moe
So many colours in the diamonds, Kaleidoscope
Last year I made a hundred million dollars flat
Run in ya house, and get to poppinâ at your shower cap
My homies got them firebirds like Pontiac
And if them bitches donât sell, we buy em back
Where the strippers, tell em Tune on his way
Tell them niggas Iâm strapped like lingerie
I ain't trippin, Iâm ballin, call me NBA
I-I ain't trippin, Iâm ballin, call me NBA


You think youâre ballin cause you got a block?
He think he ballin cause he got a block?
You know these hoes came to see me ball
You know these hoes love to see me ball


You think youâre ballin cause you got a block?
He think he ballin cause he got a block?
