See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I wait for you

Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait for you

And I can't live
With or without you
With or without you
With or without you

Through the storm we reach the shore
Give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
Oh, with or without you
With or without you

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give
And you give
And you give yourself away

My hands are tied
My body bruised
I've got nothing to win and
Nothing left to lose

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give
And you give
And you give

I can't live
With or without you
With or without you
Oh, with or without you
