I dont' wanna loose
This good thing (Baby)
That I got If I do, now
I would surely
I got to, I got to loose a lot

Cause your love is better
Than any love I know

I said its like thunder
Its like lightning
The way you love me is frightn'in
I think I better knock, knock, knock on wood

I'm not superstitous...
 About what?
 About you But I can't take no chance
You got me spinnning Spinning
Baby I'm in a trance

Your love is better
Than anything I know

I said its like thunder
Its like lightning
The way you love me is frightn'in
I think I better knock, knock, knock on wood

I dont see that women
To feel my loving colour
You got me seeing
She can really see
That I can't get enough

Its just one touch
From you baby
You know it just means so much

I said its like thunder
Its like lightning
The way you love me is frightn'ing
I think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
I think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
I think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
I think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
