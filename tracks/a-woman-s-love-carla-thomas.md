When I ask you where you've been
Don't get angry
I know you were with a friend

But that's just a woman's
Oh, that's a woman's
A woman's love
Oh, yes, it is

When I ask you to say you love me
I know you told just yesterday
But that's just a woman's
Oh, a woman's loving way

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Deep down in my heart
I know you're true
But I can't help
Oh, being jealous of you

You've got so much to satisfy me
And I know you'll keep on, keep on
Keep on keeping me happy, oh, oh

When I ask you to stay at home
I'm not being selfish, oh
I just don't wanna be all alone

And that's just a woman's
Oh, I said a woman's
A woman's love
Oh, yes, it is

I said that's a woman's
Oh, that's a woman's
Oh, it's a woman's love
Oh, yes, it is

I said that's a woman's
Oh, that's a woman's
That's a woman's love
