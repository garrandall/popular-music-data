Say you don't love him, my salamander
Why do you need him?
Oh no, don't answer, oh no
I'm getting closer
I'm getting closer to your heart


Keeping ahead of the rain on the road
Watching my windscreen wipers (wipers)
Radio, play me a danceable ode
Cattle beware of snipers (snipers)
Oh, oh


When will you see me, my salamander?
Don't try to tell me
Oh no, don't answer, oh no
I'm getting closer
I'm getting closer to your heart


Hitting the chisel and making a joint
Gluing my fingers together (together)
Radio play me a song with a point
Sailor beware of weather (weather)
Oh, woah-oh


I'm getting closer, my salamander
When will we be there?
Oh no, don't answer, oh no
I'm getting closer
I'm getting closer to your heart
I'm getting closer to your heart
I'm getting closer to your heart


Getting closer
Closer, closer
Closer, closer, closer, closer
