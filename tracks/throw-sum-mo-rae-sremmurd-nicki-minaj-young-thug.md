Ass fat, yea I know
You just got cash, blow some mo'
Blow some mo', blow some mo'
The more you spend it, the faster it go
Bad bitches, on the floor, its rainin' hunnids
Throw some mo', throw some mo'
Throw some mo', throw some mo'


Hi, bye hater, I flood the club with paper
Shorty got an ass some for now and some for later, (delicious)
Something like Nicki's, dancin' like Maliah
How I'm throwing all this money, I'ma fuck around and buy her
I can flick the money all night til' my wrist tired (tired)
If you put in work, this the night you gon' retire (retire)
You a bad bitch, I ain't even gon' deny ya
She told me throw that money, I said make it worth my while
I'm bout' to empty out the ATM, (throw it throw it throw it)
She doin' tricks that make a nigga wanna spend, (blow it, blow it)
Girl you know you got me fascinated,
Just keep on dancin' til I'm outta paper, (never)


Ass fat, yea I know
You just got cash, blow some mo'
Blow some more, blow some mo'
The more you spend it, the faster it go
Bad bitches, on the floor, its rainin' hunnids
Throw some mo', throw some mo'
Throw some mo', throw some mo'
Throw some mo'


Franklins, raining on your body
Raining on your body
Raining on your body
Won't you do what I say
Start rubbin' on your body
Hunnids on your body
But you need to get naughty
Hold up, hold on, her eyes on me
Is that your hoe, if so, I'ma get her before the nights over
DJ playin' my shit so I'm finna crank up off in the VIP zone
See the money go up and she dance on site
By the end of the night she on end though
Let me see you make it clap on tempo
Let me see you get low like limbo, (work)


Ass fat, yea I know
You just got cash, blow some mo'
Blow some mo', blow some mo'
The more you spend it, the faster it go
Bad bitches, on the floor, its rainin' hunnids
Throw some mo', throw some mo'
Throw some mo', throw some mo'
Throw some mo'


Come here hoe, mistletoe
I got birdies, crows
Lil bitty bitch wanna jump on this dick
I'm like boo let's get it, let's get it
I got these bitches kissing on these bitches
I can't even count em' I fuck by the digits
Swag, terrific, I might fuck this bitch in the kitchen
Baby don't use dirty dishes or else you might whip up a brrrr
My neck, my wrist is a brrrr
She wanna fuck my dawg I'm like rufff
Panoramic roof I drive the coupe too
Pull up with a bitch that look like New New
Its okay if I lie to you bitch my swag the truth
Aye she come right back that's what them diamonds do
50,000 on 50 niggas no caliber


Ass fat, yea I know
You just got cash, blow some mo'
Blow some mo', blow some mo'
The more you spend it, the faster it go
Bad bitches, on the floor, its rainin hunnids
Throw some mo', throw some mo'
Throw some mo', throw some mo'
Throw some mo'
