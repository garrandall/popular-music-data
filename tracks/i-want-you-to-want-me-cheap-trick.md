I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'm beggin' you to beg me


I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me


I'll shine up the old brown shoes, put on a brand-new shirt
I'll get home early from work if you say that you love me


Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?
Feelin' all alone without a friend, you know you feel like dyin'
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?


I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'm beggin' you to beg me


I'll shine up the old brown shoes, put on a brand-new shirt
I'll get home early from work if you say that you love me


Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?
Feelin' all alone without a friend, you know you feel like dyin'
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?




Feelin' all alone without a friend, you know you feel like dyin'
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?




I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'm beggin' you to beg me
