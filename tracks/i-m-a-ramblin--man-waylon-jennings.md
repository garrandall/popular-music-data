I've been down to Mississippi
Down through New Orleans
Yes I have
I've played in California
There ain't too much I haven't seen
No there ain't
Lord, I'm a ramblin' man
Don't fool around with a ramblin' man

Left a girl in West Virginia
Up there where that green grass grows
Yes I did
Got a girl in Cincinatti
Waitin' where the Ohio River flows
Oh, girl
I'm a ramblin' man
Don't give your heart to a ramblin' man

You better move away
You're standing too close to the flame
Once I mess with your mind
Your little heart won't be the same
But I'm a ramblin' man
Don't mess around with and ol' ramblin' man

You better not
Well, up in Chicago
I was known as quite a boy
Yes I was
Down in Alabama
They call me the man of joy
Still do
Well, I'm a ramblin' man
Don't fall in love with a ramblin' man

You better move away
You're standing to close to the flame
Once I mess with the ol' mind
Your little ol' heart won't be the same
Oh, I'm a ramblin' man
Don't mess around with any ol' ramblin man...
