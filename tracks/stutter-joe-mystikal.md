My dear-my dear-my dear you do not know me
But I know you very well
Now let me tell you that I c-c-c-c-caught you
(Why you lyin' to me?)
My dear-my dear-my dear you do not know me
But I know you very well
Now let me tell you that I caught you in a-another lie


T-T-T-Talk to me, tell me where you were? (Late last night)
Y-Y-Y-You told me, "With your friends, hangin' out" (Late last night)
Y-Y-Y-You're lying 'cause you're stuttering
Now where were you? (Late last night)
Stop lyin' to me 'cause you're tickin' me off
See you're tickin' me off, oh-oh


I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter


I called you on your cell phone, no answer (Tell me why?)
So I paged you on your two-way, still no response (Tell me why?)
I took care of you, I loved you and you played me (Tell me why?)
Stop lyin' to me about where you've been
'Cause you're tickin' me off, t-t-tickin' me off


I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter


My dear, my dear, my dear
You do not know me but I know you very well
Now let me tell you that I c-c-c-c-caught you
My dear, my dear, my dear
You do not know me but I know you very well
Now let me tell you that I caught you in a-another lie


Quit-quit-quit-quit-quit cha lyin', heffer, watch yourself
Yeah, I'll give the whips but leavin' you out'chere by yourself
I'm keepin' it gangsta with all the tattoos and the platinum mouth
I was the rapper you heard about strappin' up in the Waffle House
Right next to niggas when I be sparkin' 'em out
And I'm way too cold for playin' to let you come and dog me out
Should've of knew what you was up to when you got here
Get off my couch (Get)
And I just can't change it, it's gon' be good, get out on ya route
My bad, Joe
I-I-I-I seen it comin' with that nappy hair
She was runnin' docked out, wantin' what you had
Y-Y-Y-You let 'em set'cha up and you fell for it
Now it's, "I-I-I'm sorry" my ass
That's why you're payin' for it
You got the garbage, I got the trash can for it
The man ain't gon stand for it
You better respect my flow
Don't be stutterin' when you're talking to Mystikal
Or lyin' when you be talking to J-J-Joe


I smell cologne, damn it's strong
How'd you get it on? (I'm not dumb)
He messed up your hair, makeup's everywhere
Oh yeah (I'm not dumb)
Girl, you're crying 'cause you're lying
To my face (I'm not dumb)
Stop lying about seein' a man
'Cause you're ticking me off, t-t-t-ticking me off


I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
(T-T-T-Ticking me off, T-T-T-Ticking me off)
You stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
(T-T-T-Ticking me off)
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
(T-T-T-Ticking me off, T-T-T-Ticking me off)
You stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
(T-T-T-Ticking me off)
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
(T-T-T-Ticking me off, T-T-T-Ticking me off)
You stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
(T-T-T-Ticking me off)
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutterI can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
(T-T-T-Ticking me off, T-T-T-Ticking me off)
You stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
(T-T-T-Ticking me off)


I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
You Stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
