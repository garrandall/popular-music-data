I can't explain the things you do to me
But I'm sure there's an explanation
Maybe it's the way you carry yourself
Or maybe it's your conversation
You got me tiptoeing on a cloud
I pray that I might fall through
And hit rock bottom, soon to be forgotten
Like so many other people do

I need you to help me convince myself (oh-oh-oh, I love you)
That besides me there's no-one else (oh-oh-oh, I love you)

Cause I feel a whole lot of shakin' in my heart since I met you
Don't you know I a whole lot of shakin' in my heart since I met you

The guys I used to hang around with
Tell me that I've changed, that I'm acting kinda strange
But they don't realise that since I met you
My whole life has been rearranged
You make me feel kinda insecure
Cause my heart, I can no longer control
And you've got me knocking, jumping and stopping
Don't know which way I'm supposed to go

My heart is all tied up in knots (oh-oh-oh, I love you)
I walk around daily in a state of shock (oh-oh-oh, I love you)

Cause I feel a whole lot of shakin' in my heart since I met you
Don't you know I feel a whole lot of shakin' in my heart since I met you

My heart is all tied up in knots (oh-oh-oh, I love you)
I walk around daily in a state of shock (oh-oh-oh, I love you)

Cause I feel a whole lot of shakin' in my heart since I met you
Don't you know I feel a whole lot of shakin' in my heart since I met you
