DJ please
Pick up your phone
I'm on the request line

Baby, baby, ba-ba baby baby
Baby, Baby, alright all night

I know it's better when the rhythm works together
With the beat in your soul
Did I ever tell you
How you make me feel
Every night you're on the control

So come on daddy won't you take it away
I know I call your line every day
I'm dialing five, five, five, zero, four, twenty-nine
So that I can hear you say, hey

Hey, baby boo
Just tell me what
I can play for you, hey
You're right on time
You just got through the request line
Baby, baby, ba-ba baby, baby

Baby every single day
I call you, I call you
Baby every single night
Alright now, alright
Mr. DJ I know that you will
Remember this voice calling you
It's been a while so how you been, oh

So turn it up as I shake it on down
(shake it, shake it, shake it baby)
And catch the vinyl as it's spinning around, yeah
Give me five, five, five, zero, four, twenty-nine
That's the number that we're dialing tonight, hey

Hey, baby boo
Just tell me what
I can play for you, hey
You're right on time
You just got through the request line
Baby, baby, ba-ba baby, baby

Baby every single day
I call you, I call you
Baby every single night
Alright now, alright
Mr. DJ I know that you will
Remember this voice calling you
It's been a while so how you been, oh

Baby, baby, ba-baby, baby, baby
Repeat above while:
You gotta keep it hot, baby
(You gotta keep it hot, baby)
You gotta keep it hot, baby
You gotta keep it hot, baby, ah, come on

Hey, baby boo
Just tell me what
I can play for you, hey
You're right on time
You just got through the request line
Baby, baby, ba-ba baby, baby
Baby every single day
Baby every single night

Baby, baby, ba-ba baby, baby
Dialing five fifty-five zero four and twenty-nine
I'll be ringing it all night
I'm calling ya
Oh baby put me through
Put me on so I can grove
Dialing five, and fifty-five, I'm calling
Dialing five and fifty-five
Zero four and twenty-nine
I'm calling on your line
I'm calling, I'm calling
Dialing five and fifty-five zero four and twenty-nine
Five, five, and fifty-five
Oh, ah ha
(Baby)
