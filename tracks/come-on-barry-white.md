You're a freak, sweet freak
You like to play
Hypnotic, erotic, sexy little ganes
You like to play
Just look at you
All those subtle little movements
You like to play
Baby believe me when I say
I just love to play with you

Come on come on girl
Come on come on girl
Come on come on girl
Come here baby
I can't stand it, I can't much more
The way you dance ,oh baby
You move your body like you're teasing me
Oh baby,ah baby

I'll love you day and night
I'm with you wrong or right
I'll keep you satified cause satifaction's guarenteed
Girl I need your love
Just give me all your love
Love you, oh baby, oh right now
Right here baby

There's no other like you in this world
Oh no baby, nah baby
You're so pretty I could eat you girl
Don't stop baby, ah baby

I love you night and day
In this this all the way
My love will always be satisfaction guarenteed
Oh baby, sure enough
You mean that much to me
Oh baby, sure enough you mean that much to me

Girl I need you to give me all your love
Llove you oh baby,oh right here
Right now

Come on come on girl
