I can't quit her
She got a hold on me
She got her hand on my soul
I can't quit her
'Cause I see her face everywhere I go
In the city streets, country fields
In the back of my mind
I know it can't be real
For a woman to possess
All the tenderness she had

But the hands of time
Keep tickin' on my back
'Cause it's been so long
Since I had her back beside me

Oh, I love you, girl
Oh, oh, I love you
Oh, oh, I love you

I can't quit her
'Cause in my darkest night
She comes on like a light
I can't quit her
Try as I may, with all my might
She had a woman's touch
Young girl's eyes
And in seconds flat I was hypnotized
Turned around
And made to feel sweet love

But the hands of time
Keep tickin' on my back
'Cause it's been so long
Since I had her back beside me

Oh, I love you, girl
Oh, oh, I love you
Oh, oh, I love you

Oh, I love you, girl
Oh, oh, I love you
Oh, oh, I love you
Oh, oh, I love you
Oh, oh, I love you
Oh, oh, I love you
Oh, oh, I love you
Oh, oh, I love you
Oh, oh, I love you
Oh, oh, I love you
