Oh what a fool I was, I really fell in love
But I thought that she wasn't in love with me
Oh what a fool I was

Oh what a fool I was and all my friends agree
'Cause I thought that she wasn't in love with me
Oh what a fool I was

How could I know, how could I tell
How could I know what was in,
What was in her little little heart

Oh what a fool I was, I really fell in love
But I thought that she wasn't in love with me
Oh what a fool I was

Oh what a fool I was and all my friends agree
'Cause I thought that she wasn't in love with me
Oh what a fool I was

How could I know, how could I tell
How could I know what was in,
What was in her little little heart

I was a fool
Yea, yea, yes I know
Oh well I know I was a fool
I was a fool
