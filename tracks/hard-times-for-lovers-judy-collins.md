Seems like it was just a while ago
All of my friends and I
Went to each other's weddings
And stood by each other's sides
And became brides
But talking on the phone with Kirk today
He said that he and Liz were through
And by the way that things have been going
You could say they were overdue

For every other married pair of us
Had already split in two
Each of us turning out lights alone
Or sleeping with someone new
Ain't it true

These are hard times for lovers
Everyone wants to be free
Ain't these hard times for lovers
Everyone's singing
I got to be me without you

Now, honey, I'm supposed to tell you
I've got to live for today
And don't you see it is my lifetime
I've got to live it my own way

But lately I can't help thinking
I reap what I sow
For all of my holy freedom
What have I got to show
I don't know

These are hard times for lovers
Everyone wants to be free
Ain't these hard times for lovers
Everyone's singing
I got to be me without you

Ain't these hard times for lovers
Everyone wants to be free
Ain't these hard times for lovers
Everyone's singing
I got to be me without you
Without you
Without you
