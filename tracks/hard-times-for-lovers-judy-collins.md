Seems it was just a while ago
All of my friends and i
Went to each other's weddings
And stood by each other's side
And became brides

Talked to kurt on the phone today
He said that he and liz were through
And by the way that
Things have been going
You could that they were overdue

For every other married pair of us
That already split in two
Each of us turning our own lives alone
For sleeping with someone new
Ain't it true

(Chorus)
These are hard times for lovers
Everyone wants to be free
Ain't these hard times for lovers
Everyone singing, i gotta be me
Without you

Now, honey, i'm supposed to tell you
I've got to live for today
And don't you know it is my lifetime
I've got to live it my own way

And lately, i can't help thinking
I reap what i sow
For all of my holy freedom
What have i got to show
I don't know

(Chorus)

But lately, i can't help thinking
I reap what i sow
For all of my holy freedom
What have i got to show
I don't know

(Chorus)

Ain't these hard times for lovers
Everyone wants to be free
Ain't these hard times for lovers
