Some things you never get used to!
It's the same routine of getting up every morning
And putting on a smile
But underneath there's another person
Who can't find a reason to make living worthwhile.
Oh, another day to get through
Without the love that once was mine
Sometimes I think my heartaches come to an end
And then something brings them all back again
Like wanting you
And not having you
I'll never get used to!
I've gotten used to not listenin' for familiar sounds
You use to make
Now I'm trying to get out of the habit
Of calling your name first thing when I awake.
Look here!
It's like a child's first steps
I had to learn to walk all, all over again
Cause you were always there
If I should fall
And now there's nobody else that I can call
It's like wanting you
And not having you
I'll never get used to!

Lost in a crowd
I think I caught a glimpse of you...
Blindly I rushed
To touch your head, huh!
To discover...
It's my mind playing tricks on me again!
(Tricks on me again)
Some things you never get used to!
Sometimes I think my heartaches come to an end
And then something brings them all back again
Like wanting you
And not having you
I'll never get used to!
Baby, baby it's
Wanting you
And not having you
I'll never get used to!
Look here! oh!
I'm wanting you
And not having you
I'll never get used to!
