A boy chases a girl until she catches him
But this is one thing he should never see
And the love for her man makes a woman understand
And that's the way love should be

Woman helping man
Underneath God's plan
Woman helping man
And man protecting her the best he can

A man goes through this world trying the best he can
Sometimes his love means sympathy
But when she holds him tight, suddenly everything's all right
That's the way love should be

Woman helping man
Underneath God's plan
Woman helping man
And man protecting her the best he can

Woman helping man
Underneath God's plan
