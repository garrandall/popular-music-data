There are times when I look above and beyond
There are times when I feel your love around me, baby
I'll never forget my baby
I'll never forget you


There are times when I look above and beyond
There are times when I feel your love around me, baby
I'll never forget my baby
When I feel that I don't belong
Draw my strength from the words when you said
Hey, it's about you, baby
Look deeper inside you, baby


Dream about us together again
What I want: us together again, baby
I know we'll be together again, 'cause


Everywhere I go, every smile I see
I know you are there smilin' back at me
Dancin' in moonlight, I know you are free
'Cause I can see your star shinin' down on me


(Together again, oh
Good times we'll share again
(Together again, oh
Makes me wanna dance
(Together again, oh
Say it loud and proud
(Together again, oh
All my love's for you


Always been a true angel to me - now above
I can't wait for you to wrap your wings around me, baby
(Wrap them around me, baby)
Oh, wrap them around me, baby
(Wrap them around me, baby)
Sometimes hear you whisperin' "No more pain"
No worries will you ever see now, baby
(Ever see you, baby)
I'm so happy for my baby
(Happy for you, baby)


Dream about us together again
What I want: us together again, baby
I know we'll be together again, 'cause


Everywhere I go, every smile I see
I know you are there smilin' back at me
Dancin' in moonlight, I know you are free
'Cause I can see your star shinin' down on me


(Together again, oh
Good times we'll share again
(Together again, oh
Makes me wanna dance
(Together again, oh
Say it loud and proud
(Together again, oh
All my love's for you


There are times when I look above and beyond
There are times when I feel you smile upon me, baby
I'll never forget my baby
What I'd give just to hold you close as on earth
In heaven, we will be together, baby
(Together)
Together again, my baby
(Together again, my baby)


Everywhere I go, every smile I see
I know you are there smilin' back at me
Dancin' in moonlight, I know you are free
'Cause I can see your star shinin' down on me
Everywhere I go, every smile I see
I know you are there smilin' back at me
Dancin' in moonlight, I know you are free
'Cause I can see your star shinin' down on me
