Rescue me, take me in your arms 
Rescue me. I want your tender charms 
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm blue 
I need you and your love too 
Come on and rescue me 

Come on baby, and rescue me 
Come on baby, and rescue me 
'Cause I need you by my side 
Can't you see that I'm lonely 

Rescue me, come on and take my heart 
Take your love and conquer every part 
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm blue 
I need you and your love too 
Come on and rescue me 

Come on baby, and rescue me 
Come on baby, and rescue me 
'Cause I need you by my side 
Can't you see that I'm lonely 

Come on baby, take me baby 
Hold me baby, love me baby 
Can't you see that I need you baby 
Can't you see that I'm lonely 
Rescues me 
Come on and take my hand 

Come on baby and be my man 
'Cause I love you 
'Cause I want you 
Can't you see that I'm lonely 
Take me baby 
Love me baby 
Need me baby 
Can't you see that I'm lonely
