Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face
You told me how proud you were, but I walked away
If only I knew what I know today


I would hold you in my arms
I would take the pain away
Thank you for all you've done
Forgive all your mistakes
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To hear your voice again
Sometimes I wanna call you, but I know you won't be there


Oh, I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself by hurting you


Some days I feel broke inside, but I won't admit
Sometimes I just wanna hide 'cause it's you I miss
And it's so hard to say goodbye when it comes to this


Would you tell me I was wrong?
Would you help me understand?
Are you lookin' down upon me?
Are you proud of who I am?
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To have just one more chance
To look into your eyes and see you looking back


Oh, I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself
Oh, oh


If I had just one more day
I would tell you how much that
I've missed you since you've been away
Oh, it's dangerous
It's so out of line
To try and turn back time


Oh, I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself by hurting you
