Out on the town kicking around feeling bluesy
It's getting late I can't afford to be choosy
Should be home and dry by now
Tried every trick in the book but


Another night Saturday night and I'm losing
Another night Saturday night and I'm losing

The DJ plays a song from the past I remember
I hold her tight in my arms she surrenders
It's the same old record playing
But it's a different girl that's swaying



As we move around the room
Whispering things with my eyes closed
I feels that you're here
Then the music stops I open my eyes
My fantasy ends We're not even friends

So leave me to catch my ride pay my fare on my way home
The same thing every week on my own
Next time around you might be there
My luck might change but until then
