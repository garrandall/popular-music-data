Feather in your cap if you catch a robber,
Dirt in your face if your scheme falls through
Pay close attention to my story
Youll find every word is true.
Junk man standing on the corner
Selling death, no concience has he.
In the name of God, wont somebody stop him
stop him, think about the children
Its a matter of life and death, you see.
Aint no time to stand back and point your finger,
Weve got to face reality.
No, no, no, no, no...
Dont turn your back on this problem, people,
too much depends on you and me.
Desprate with no sense of value,
just an evil mind lurking through the night.
Because of you, the streets aint safe no more for walking,
cause youre feeling so up-tight.
Take a look around
