Golden days
Life was play
Pain was all a world away
We went to school
We learned the rules
We trusted all they had to say
Then life took a turn
We all had to learn
And we can't go back again


And my heart is breaking
Just for you
Just for you
And my arms are open
Just for you
Just for you
Just for you


God was god
And dreams were dreams
Life was all cake and ice cream
Truth was true
And lies were lies
And we thought love would never die
But the world moved on
My illusions gone
And I don't know who to blame


And my heart is breaking
Just for you
Just for you
And my arms are open
Just for you
Just for you
And these tears I'm crying are for you
Just for you
Just for you
Just for you


I'm looking for protection
Give me shelter from the storm
I just hope this light inside me
Keeps me strong

Oh baby
Oh baby


And my heart is breaking
Just for you
Just for you
And my arms they're open
Just for you
And these tears I'm crying are for you
Just for you
And my arms they're open
Just for you
Just for you
And my heart is breaking
For you
Just for you
Just for you
My heart is breaking
My heart is breaking
Just for you
Just for you
Breaking, breaking
Just for you


Just for you
Oh my heart is breaking
And my arms are open
Oh these tears I'm crying are just for you
Oh yeah
