Hey, why ain't I
Your number one man

Tell me that you really need me
That I'm your only love
Always thinking about me
You're true as the stars above


I've been true to you, baby
But there's one thing
I don't understand
If all that stuff you say is true
Why ain't I your number one

I asked you for a date last night
You said you wasn't up to par
Then I go out for a little walk
And see you in a big fine car

Don't say it was your brother
Who took you by surprise
I watched him walk you to your door
It wasn't brotherly love in his eyes



I asked you for a date last night
You said you wasn't up to par
Then I go out for a little walk
And see you in a big fine car

Don't say it was your brother
Who took you by surprise
I watched him walk you to your door
It wasn't brotherly love in his eyes



Hey, why ain't I
Your number one man, yeah
Hey, number one man
