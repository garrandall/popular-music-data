Hi hello awake from thy sleep
God has given your soul to keep
All of the power that burns in the flame
Ignites the light in a single name
Frederick, name of care
Fast asleep in a room somewhere
Guardian angels lay abed
Shed their light on my sleepy head
High on a threshold yearning to sing
Down with the dancers having one last fling
Here's to the moment when you said hello
Come into my spirit are you ready let's go


Hi hi hey hey maybe I will
Come back some day now
But tonight on the wings of a dove
Up above to the land of love


Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
Kiss to kiss, breath to breath
My soul surrenders astonished to death
Night of wonder promise to keep
Set our sails channel the deep
Capture the rapture, two hearts meet
Minds entwind in a single beat
Frederick, you're the one
As we journey from sun to sun
All the dreams I waited so long for
Our flight tonight so long so long
Bye bye hey hey maybe


We will come back some day now
But tonight on the wings of a dove
Up above to the land of love


Frederick, name of care
High above with sky to spare
All the things I've been dreaming of
All expressed in this name of love
