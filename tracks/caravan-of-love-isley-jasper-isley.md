Ooh... Ooh... Ooh...
Ooh... Ooh... Ooh...

Are you ready for the time of your life
It's time to stand up and fight
(It's alright) it's alright (It's alright, it's alright)
Hand in hand we'll take a caravan
To the motherland

One by one we're gonna stand with the pride
One that can't be denied
(Stand up, stand up, stand up)
From the highest mountain, and valley low
Well join together with hearts of gold

Now the children of the world can see
There's a better way for us to be
The place where mankind is born is so neglected and torn...
Torn apart

Every woman, every man
Join the caravan of love
(Stand up, stand up, stand up)
Everybody take a stand
Join the caravan of love

I'm your brother
I'm your brother, don't you know
I'm your brother
I'm your brother, don't you know

We'll be living in a world of peace
In a day when everyone is free
We'll bring the young and the old
Won't you let your love flow from your heart

Every woman, every man
Join the caravan of love
(Stand up, stand up, stand up)
Everybody take a stand
Join the caravan of love

I'm your brother
I'm your brother, don't you know
I'm your brother
I'm your brother, don't you know

Now the children of the world can see
There's a better way for us to be
The place where mankind is born
Is so neglected and torn... torn apart

Every woman, every man
Join the caravan of love
(Stand up, stand up, stand up)
Everybody take a stand
Join the caravan of love

Are you ready for the time of your life
(Are you ready, are you ready)
Are you ready for the time of your life
(Are you ready, are you ready)

Come go with me
(Are you ready, are you ready)
Come go with me
(Are you ready, are you ready)

Every woman, every man
Join the caravan of love (Are you ready, are you ready) Everybody take a stand
Join the caravan of love (Are you ready, are you ready)

Every woman, every man
Join the caravan of love (Are you ready, are you ready) Everybody take a stand
Join the caravan of love (Are you ready)
