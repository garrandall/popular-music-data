Are you ready
Are you ready
Are you ready
Are you ready
Are you ready for the time of life
It's time to stand up and fight
So all right
So all right
Hand in hand we take a caravan to the marble land
One by one we gonna stand up with pride
One that can't be denied
Stand up
Stand up
From the highest mountain of valley old
We all shall together with heart of gold
Now the children of the world can see
This a better place for us to be
The place is which we were born
So neglected and torn apart

Every woman every man
Join the caravan of love
(Stand up) stand up
Stand up
Every body takes a stand
Join the caravan of love
(Stand up) stand up
Stand up

I'm your brother
I'm your brother don't you know
She's my sister
She's my sister don't you know

We'll be living in the world of peace
And the day when everyone is free
Bring the young and the old
Want you let chilled flow from your heart

Every woman every man
Join the caravan of love
(Stand up) stand up
Stand up
Every body takes a stand
Join the caravan of love
(Stand up) stand up
Stand up

I'm your brother
I'm your brother don't you know
She's my sister
She's my sister don't you know

So are you ready (he's coming)
Are you ready (he's coming)
Are you ready (he's coming)
Are you ready (he's coming on the caravan)
You better get ready (go for it)
You better get ready (go for it)
You better get ready (go for it)
You better get ready
