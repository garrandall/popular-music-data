I went out, last niiiiiiiight
See, that's when I met a sexy girl
She was lookin' so riiiiiiiiiiight
She said, "I wanna take you for a trip around the world"

And by the look in her eyes, ho
The girl was serious!
She wore no disguise, oh no..
So let's have some fun, yeah!


(I thought it was me) - I thought it was me who makes the girl this way
(I thought it was me) - I came to find out she's like that every day
(I thought it was me) - I thought it was me that makes that girl so wild
(I thought it was me) - I found out she's like that with all the guys


Yo, I love bein a bachelor
Ricky said, "Yo, that girl's a good catch for ya"
She and I choose to cruise in my love boat
My waterbed, kept us afloat
I had to prove my manhood
Show her that the B-I-V was DAMN good, understood?
I never had my boat rocked like that before, YO!!


The way we left the spot, all systems ready to go
She said, "Sit back and relax, I'm runnin' the show"
I couldn't hesitate, it was much too late
That girl had got me straight, and I was ready to go, yeah!

B!!! (yeah..)
B!!! (yeah..)
D!!! (yeah...)
B.B.D
B!!! (yeah..)
B!!! (yeah..)
D!!! (yeah...)
B.B.D


Yo' Ron, was-SUP, wit that
fly girl you left the jam with?
She's stickin' closer to you
Than the bread on the meat of my sandwich
I know you rock a beach, cuz


Naaaw, it wasn't even like that
She left the room to get comfy and cozy (wha?)
Then the R to the O to the N got nosey


Cruising guys was her favorite past-time
Takin' chances almost got her lifetime
She said, "You only live oooooonce"
Stayin' loose, made many head turns
If you did her wrong, you just might get burned.
So let's have some fun, yeah-HE!


(I thought it was me) - I thought it was me who makes the girl this way
(I thought it was me) - I came to find out she's like that every day
(I thought it was me) - I thought it was me that makes that girl so wild
(I thought it was me) - I found out she's like that with all the guys

(I thought it was me) - I thought it was me who makes the girl this way
(I thought it was me) - I came to find out she's like that every day
(I thought it was me) - I thought it was me that makes that girl so wild
(I thought it was me) - I found out she's like that with all the guys

(I thought it was me) - I THOUGHT IT WAS ME, ho, yeah yeah
(I thought it was me) - I CAME TO FIND OUT SHE'S LIKE THAT EVERYDAY
(I thought it was me) - I THOUGHT IT WAS ME THAT MAKES THAT GIRL GO WIIIIILD
(I thought it was me) - I FOUND OUT SHE'S LIKE THAT WITH ALL THE GUYS

(I thought it was me) - I THOUGHT IT WAS ME THAT MAKES THAT GIRL THIS WAY..
I CAME TO FIND OUT SHE'S LIKE THAT EVERYDAY..
I THOUGHT IT WAS ME THAT MAKES THAT GIRL GO WIIIIILD..
I FOUND OUT SHE'S LIKE THAT WITH ALL THE GUYS..

I Thought it was ME, ho, yeah yah
I thought it was me, HOOOO..
I thought it was me, ho, yeah, yeah...
