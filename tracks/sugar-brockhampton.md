It's seven o'clock on the dot
I'm in the drop top, your legs on the dashboard
(Your legs on the dashboard, ooh)
So tell me what I have to do
Whenever I'm missin' you?
Tell me, do you love me? I, I

Spendin' all my nights alone waiting for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for?
Tell me what I'm waitin' for?
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

I move mountains on my own
Don't need nobody's help
I been lookin' after me like only I can watch my back
Loving me and it keeps hurting me
I hate it when I lose control over my heart
You know you really turned me on right from the start
Just to hear you call my name, my call to God
Selfishly I keep it all for me
Usually I don't wait too long
But for you I might

Spendin' all my nights alone waiting for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for?
Tell me what I'm waitin' for?
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

I don't wanna blink and see you out (I don't)
Pressed up on my body like no doubt (No doubt)
I don't want this moving too fast
(Play your part) That's a damn shame
Run and go make your man insane

Spendin' all my nights alone waiting for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for?
Tell me what I'm waitin' for?
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

Show me all the sugar I been patient for
Pour some more of your sugar on me
Show me all the sweet things you got in store
Pour some more of your sugar on me
Where's the sweet thing when I need some more, babe?
Show me some sugar when I'm feelin' lonely
I be inspired, we relating
Baby, just don't keep me waiting
Come be my sugar baby

Spendin' all my nights alone waiting for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for?
Tell me what I'm waitin' for?
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

Back and forth
I'll take that if that's all you asking for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport, passport

You're takin' my heart all over again
Watchin' my man, watchin' his body
Look at his body

So do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me? Oh

I'm your candy man
I'll be your candy man
I'm your candy man

I'm your candy man
I'll be your candy man
I'm your candy man
