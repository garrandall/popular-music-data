(Sometimes I wonder why I spend the lonely nights) dreamin' of a song
The melody haunts my reverie and I am once again with you
(When our love was new) and each kiss an inspiration
Oh, but that was long ago, and now my consolation is in the
stardust of a song

(And beside a garden wall, when the stars were bright)
You were in my arms, the nightingale told its fairy tale of paradise where roses grew.
Though I dream in vain, in my heart it always will remain
My stardust melody (the memory of love's refrain)



Though I dream in vain, in my heart it always will remain
My stardust melody (the memory of love's refrain)



The memory (of love's refrain)
