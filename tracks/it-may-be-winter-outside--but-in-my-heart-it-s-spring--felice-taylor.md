When the temperature dips, I'm in my baby's arms
His tender fingertips know just how to keep me warm
It may be zero degrees with the snow fallin' down
I've got warm and tender love just as long as he's around

Chorus:
It may be winter outside
But in my heart it's spring
How much joy and pleasure
Can one guy bring

Winter nights can be awful cold
Without someone to hold
But when I have you next to me baby
I'm in ecstasy

(Repeat Chorus)

Throughout my life I've had my share of guys
But he's been the only one
Who can make my temperature rise
Things are just not the same
When he's not by my side
And yet I shouldn't complain
But be waiting with my arms open wide

(Repeat Chorus to fade).
