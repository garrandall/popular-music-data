Smooth up in ya
Mama, whoa

I know you really want to move me
You know I like to see you try
I've said it before and I'll say it again
You're not my type if you don't begin

Looks like you're the hard kind
I ain't got that kind of time
Oh, I send shivers

(Smooth up in ya)
(Smooth up in ya)
In ya

You say I'm never gonna break ya
But we won't know until we try
So now's the time to make up your mind
I'll never ever be the one woman kind

Don't let your lovin' go to waste
All it takes is just one taste
Oh I send shivers

(Smooth up in ya)
(Smooth up in ya)
Smooth up in ya
(Smooth up in ya)
I wanna go, I wanna go
(Smooth up in ya)
Right now, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Oh oh oh
I wanna go
I wanna
I wanna go

Oh yeah yeah yeah, don't let your lovin' go to waste
Oh honey child, I'm gonna give you a taste
Whoa I send shivers

(Smooth up in ya)
(Smooth up in ya)
Smooth up in ya

(Smooth up in ya)
(Smooth up in ya)
I said it before and I'll say it again

(Smooth up in ya) Whoa
(Smooth up in ya) Whoa I really wanna go
(Smooth up in ya)
(Smooth up in ya) (I really wanna go)

(Smooth up in ya)
(Smooth up in ya) Yeah, yeah

(Smooth up in ya)
(Smooth up in ya) I really want to go
