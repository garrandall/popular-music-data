Ohhhh, Ohhhh
Operator, are you sure
That line is busy all this time
Won't you please dial the numer
Operater, dial the number
I've got to reach that baby of mine

I've got to tell him that I'm sorry
For the things I've said
Sorry as I can be
So won't you please dial the numer
Operator, dieal the numer
And see if you can get him to talk to me
Ohhhh

I wonder who he's talking to for so long
I hope he hasn't found
Found somebody new
Oh won't you please cut it
Because it's an emergency
And tell my baby
Tell my baby forgive me

I've got to tell him that I'm sorry
For the things I've said
Sorry as I can be
So won't you please dial the numer
Operator, dieal the numer
And see if you can get him to talk to me
Ohhhh
