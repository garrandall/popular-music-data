Got a house and a car
And a wedding ring
But I don't know what
I'll do without a wife

I want a girl who's pretty
Kind of warm and sweet
To bring a little love
Into my life

There comes a time
When a fellow knows
He oughta settle down
Gotta find the girl
To call his own and
Stop all this roving round

Yeah, got a chair and a
Table and a four post bed
And a garden where the
Air smells sweet

But I need a girl to
Share my everything
And make my lonely
Life complete

I saved my money
Got a steady job
Built a dream house
Just for two

I bought a sports coupe
Just the other day
And a golden wedding ring too

But the time grows short
And the nights grow long
And it's mighty peculiar life

With a house and a car
And a wedding ring
But I don't know what
I'll do without a wife
