Love leads the lines of love in circles and angles
Love runs deep like a tunnel with a pendulum beat
That touches the heart in many directions
Moving the mind in silent reflection
Of the lines that touch the corners and fibers
Of the feeling that keeps running inside you
Cycles of fears with the longing and tears
Lettin' out the needs and laughter of
Sunshine, love shine
Touching the fibers of the feeling inside you
Letting out the things you hide
Need leads the lines of love in circles and angles
Need runs deep like a tunnel with a pendulum beat
That touches the heart in many directions
Moving the mind in silent reflection
Of the lines that touch the corners and fibers
Of the feeling that keeps running inside you
Cylinders of hope turning and yearning
Into pendulums of weary hes...
...Itation, contemplation
Of the angles and rhymes and the triangle lines
The feeling touching mine with time
Want leads the lines of love in circles and angles
Want runs deep like a tunnel with a pendulum beat
That touches the heart in many directions
Moving the mind in silent reflection
Of the angles and rhymes of the circles and lines
With the tunnels of love running over
Taking the mind and triangle rhyme
And twisting it to fill the cup of
Sunshine, love shine
Touching the fibers of the feeling inside you
Letting out the things you hide
That touches the heart in many directions
Moving the mind in silent reflection
Of the lines that touch the corners and fibers
Of the feeling that keeps running inside you
Cylinders of hope turning and yearning
Into pendulums of weary hesitation
Taking the line and triangle rhyme and twisting it
To bend the mind in all directions
It's love and want and need and all those things
Tearing you apart
