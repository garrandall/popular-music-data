Papa do ron-de ron-de, do ron-de ron-de, do ron-de ron-de, oh
I got it bad for the new girl in school
The guys are flipping, but I'm playing it cool
Everybody's passing notes in class
They really dig her now she's such a gas
Pappa, pappa, pappa, do ron-de ron-de, do ron-de ron-de
Do ron-de ron-de, do ron-de ron-de, do ron-de ron-de, oh
I got a fad, pappa do ron-de ron-de, oh

The chicks are jealous of the new girl in school
They put her down and they treat her so cruel
But the guys are going out of their minds
'Cause she's the cutest chick you'll ever find

A pa pa pa pa do ronde ronde, do ronde ronde, do ronde ronde
Do ronde ronde, do ronde ronde oh I've got a fad for the
Do ronde ronde oh
Papa do ronde ronde, do ronde ronde, do ronde ronde oh

It won't be long till were having a ball
We'll walk 'n' talk 'n' we'll hold hands in the hall
Never thought I'd make it through this year
Sure was a drag till she transferred here
Pappa, pappa, pappa, do ron-de ron-de, do ron-de ronde
Do ron-de ron-de, do ron-de ron-de, do ron-de ron-de, oh
I got a fad, pappa, pappa, do ron-de ron-de, oh

Little girl if you want me to...
I got a lot going
Little girl if you want me to...
I got it bad, pappa, do ron-de ron-de
