All the things I learnt from Newport
Always twice as fast a three o'clock in the morning so no one can jump you
Always be prepared and always have a laugh
I tell you what I like Wildings at Christmas mate

I grew up in Newport in the nineteen eighties
Hanging by the castle with all my mates
Sparking up a spliff in John Frost Square
Puking on ourselves coz we just don't care
Drinking so much booze you get covered in shite
Stella Artois to Diamond White
Learnt all my lessons being from Newport
I'll always remember all I was taught

I think back and I remember well
Buying underage booze in Baneswell
Drinking on the corner taking amphets
Sharing a pack of ten cigarettes
Over Maesglas on the BMX track
Was the first time I tried squidgy black
We'd get a chase from the police
Causing trouble and disturbing the peace

There's loads of things that you can't be taught
Unless your born and raised in chikka chikka Newport
There's loads of things that you'll never see
Unless you grew up in the NPT

Ridding round the streets playing with my toys
Avoiding the Youth Firm and the Rodgy Nutty Boys
Going down the County Saturday afternoon
Making a draw yogurt heated up on a spoon
Adam and Dipper would come round my house
We'd drink ten cans and then we'd go out
Have a fat spliff on the way into town
Try walking in the Murenger without falling down

Remember when Zanzibar was Brooklyn Heights
Getting chips from Boomers and dodging fights
Hooking up with the crew after school
Go up Mister Cues to buy weed and play pool
Big up to Walshy and 38 Double D
Now that shit's just a memory
Seeing the colours on LSD
Smoking soapbar with Phil Sasha and Lee

We used to kick it in town on a Saturday
Come back from Hitman with tunes to play
Can't remember much of what went on
I think about it now but most of it's gone
I think back and reminisce
Checking out the girls I wanted to kiss
Then it's on to the park chilling on the swings
It's amazing how you remember these things

There's loads of things that you can't be taught
Unless your born and raised in chikka chikka Newport
There's loads of things that you'll never see
Unless you grew up in the NPT

I use to pick asparagus so I could get paid
At Very Hill Farm out marshfield way
I never saved any money always spent up all my cash
Often swapping it with Tony and with Willis for some Hash
Seven fifty for a teenth fiver for a gram
Get acid in the Trout Vaults never drank in the Talisman
These are things I did as a teenager
No Instagram or mobile just a BT pager
Down by the statues with the crew felt like a star
Two pound fifty for half a pizza from Newport Fish Bar
Was you a Sweaty or a Townty were you torn
Didn't care much for Ritzy's but I did Grooves Platform
I tell these stories like biblical psalms
Like that time that Giles Sports had a visit from John Barnes
Remember Barkers Chippie Jeans on display
Or Universe in Magor when Sasha DJed
You know these days might all be in the past
But fucking hell son I had a proper fucking blast
It was like a shit version of New York
But like a good shit version of new York

There's loads of things that you can't be taught
Unless your born and raised in chikka chikka Newport
There's loads of things that you'll never see
Unless you grew up in the NPT

Riding on the scramblers down the train tracks
Playing pitch and toss on the wall outside the Halifax
Shooting up the soft kids with my black widow
Newport taught me things when I was just a kiddo
Up to Brecon park to have a fight
Rolling up a blunt but no ones got a light
Fiver in the machines at Megabowl
This is the way that we use to roll
Go to registration to answer my name
Then I'd go to Rileys for a few fucking frames
Sneaking in the pictures with a straw and rifle shots
When I got older it was draw and micro dots
Learnt all my smarts in my home fucking town
Always playing up always acting the clown
Getting up to mischief but never getting caught
And I owe my education to my Home in Newport

This ain't a Hip Hop story from Brooklyn or the Bronx
When your born and raised and been port for yonks
You got tails port knowledge for laughs
Killer whales and dolphins in Maindee Baths
But I was west side Aston Stores and Johnseys
Vicky wine Garrads Shobaraj alonzi's
BMXing through Brynglas
Delivering the ad mag when I could be assed
Tosser Thompson nicking from the Smiths warehouse bins
Stories of scraps in the Boileys and the Quinns
Garry Evans for maggots fishing with Cliffy
Dallas Sue Ellen how I got my first stiffy
Half a coke at the tavern turns on the rope swings
Striming idlers in the chippy that became my thing
Then the lights and Lasers led the way to Zanzibar
80s Newport nipper turned to 90s fucking safe spa

There's loads of things that you can't be taught
Unless your born and raised in chikka chikka Newport
There's loads of things that you'll never see
Unless you grew up in the NPT

Yeah you knows it makes sense
Fucking 80s 90s 2000s all the teens
All the fucking shit 2020 70s all the fucking ages
Billy Webb fucking rocking it for the GLC innit
Yes you knows Ayingerbrau Pils use to have all of that
Anyone who's had the fucking boot
Anyone who's had a yard of ale down Dippers
You fucking knows your safe
Newport 1980s fucking loves it Almo's
Or going over to fucking Stuart Jones to get some football boots and some dubbing
You fucking knows it makes sense
Wicked fucking Billy Webb
Goldie Looking Chains fucking knows it
