(doo-wah, doo-wah, have a good time)
(doo-wah, doo-wah, have a good time)

Goodbye (goodbye) I hate to see you go
But have a good time (have a good time)
So long, I'll miss you, dear, I know
But have a good time (have a good time)

Have your fling, be gay with your new love
I'm setting you free
Dance and sing, pretend that it's true love
Don't worry 'bout me

I-I-I-I know (I know) that tears will only drive you
Farther away (farther away)
Just go, forget that I'm alive
It's your holiday (it's your holiday)

When you're tired of being reckless and carefree
Remember that I'll be waiting to welcome you home
So have a good time (have a good time)

Sax continues behind SPOKEN: "Bye, baby. Gee, I hate to see you go but have a good time."
So long SPOKEN: "You know, I'm really gonna miss you but have a good time."
End of sax

And, honey when you're tired of being reckless and carefree
Remember that I'll be waiting to welcome you home
So have a good time (have a good time)

Fade
SPOKEN: "Have a good time, baby."
