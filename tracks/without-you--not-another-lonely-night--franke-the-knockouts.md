You know
Not too long ago
You used to close your eyes
And say real low, uh-huh
Baby, I'm satisfied
Oh, I remember like it was yesterday

So stop pretending
Ooh, baby
Didn't you hear me say

Not another lonely night
No more lonely days
Cause I don't want to be without you
No, not another lonely night
Cause it ain't feelin right
And it just ain't the same for me
Without you

You know
Not too long ago
You used to hold me tight
So then, let me know before you go
Ooh, baby
What's on your mind

Oh, oh
I remember like it was yesterday
So stop pretending
Ooh, baby
Didn't you hear me say

Baby, without you

Just tell me now that you remember
All those nights
You loved me tender
There's nothing I won't do without you

Not another lonely night
No more lonely days
It ain't the same without you
Not another lonely night
'Cause it ain't feeling right
It ain't the same without you

Not another lonely night
No more lonely days
It ain't the same without you
Not another lonely night
Cause it ain't feeling right
I don't wanna be
