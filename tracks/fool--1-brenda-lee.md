Am I fool number one or am I fool number two
How many other girls have been fooled by you
I suppose that the number is far from being small
And I'll bet that I'm the biggest fool of all

If I had the chance I guess I'd do it all again
I'd go down that same old road even knowing at the end
You'll leave me when your heart hears a new love call
So I'll guess that I'm the biggest fool of all

Am I fool number one or am I fool number two
How many other girls have been fooled by you
I suppose that the number is far from being small
And I'll guess that I'm the biggest fool of all
