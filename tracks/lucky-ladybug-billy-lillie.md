Lucky Ladybug, lucky ladybug!
A lucky ladybug!
Ladybug, silver dollar, rabbit's foot
With a four leaf clover and a horseshoe
Wishbone, shamrocks got me shook
Singin' Abracadabra in a cat's eye
I wonder, wonder if you love me, guess I'll ask the star above me
When the moon is bright canary yellow
It'd really be amazin' if that crystal ball I'd gaze in
Says I'll always be your steady fellow!
Ladybug, silver dollar, rabbit's foot
With a four leaf clover and a horseshoe
Wishbone, shamrocks got me shook
Singin' Abracadabra in a cat's eye
Though your words are smooth and soothin', don't you feel it's time for groovin'
Come on, daddy, rock me wild, our band is rollin'. Uh-huh
Keep it cool, my ducky-wucky, baby doll, our love is lucky
When you walk me down the aisle, we'll do it strollin'!
Ladybug, silver dollar, rabbit's foot
With a four leaf clover and a horseshoe
Wishbone, shamrocks got me shook
Singin' Abracadabra in a cat's eye
(4 lines instrumental)
Stupid Cupid gave us fever and an itchy-twitchy feelin'
And a green mosquito must have bit us
Got us walking like two robbers makin' moon talking, bobbin'
Like a firefly, splishin' and a-splashin'
Ladybug, silver dollar, rabbit's foot
With a four leaf clover and a horseshoe
Wishbone, shamrocks got me shook
Singin' Abracadabra in a cat's eye
Lucky Ladybug, lucky ladybug!
A lucky ladybug!
A lucky ladybug!
A lucky ladybug!
A lucky ladybug!
A lucky ladybug!
