Oh, babe

I don't wanna lie
I'm gonna take what you're givin'
Cause I know you're willing
To take me all the way
You got me right here, combustible
And I can't wait to finally explode

The Big, Big Bang
The reason I'm alive
When all the stars collide in this universe inside
The Big, Big Bang

The Big, Big Bang
The Big, Big Bang

Some people like to talk
But I'm into doing
What I feel like doing
When I'm inspired
So if we take a walk down
The beach tonight
I bet that we could light up the sky

The Big, Big Bang
The reason I'm alive
When all the stars collide in this universe inside
The Big, Big Bang

The Big, Big Bang
The Big, Big Bang

Take it from me I don't wanna be mummified
Sometimes I feel so isolated
I wanna die
And I'll take it from you if you got it
Every time, so, baby, bring your body here
Next to mine, next to mine
I don't want to dream
I just want to live it
So, baby, let's not miss this thing

The Big, Big Bang
The reason I'm alive
When all the stars collide in this universe inside
The Big, Big Bang

The Big, Big Bang
The Big, Big Bang

The Big, Big, Big Bang
Oh, babe
Oh, babe
Oh, babe
