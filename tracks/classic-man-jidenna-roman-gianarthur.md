My name calling all night
I can pull the wool while I'm being polite
Like, darling calling all night
I can be a bull while I'm being polite
Like, oh me, oh me oh my
I know many women want to be in my life
Like, oh me, oh me oh my
Why can't every woman end up being my wife?

Even if she go away, even if she go away
Even if she go away, even if she go away

I'm a classic man
You can be mean when you look this clean, I'm a classic man
Calling on me like a young OG, I'm a classic man
Your needs get met by the street, elegant old fashioned man
Yeah baby I'm a classic man

I burn through the hood like whoa
When everybody's feeling so cold
I cool like Nat King Cole
And niggas get a bit of my glow
I got charm like a leprechaun, mummafunka
Now y'all fucking with the wrong mummafunka
Chief be like a don, mummafunka
And we don't live by the law, mummafunka

Even if she go away, even if she go away
Even if she go away, even if she go away

I'm a classic man
You can be mean when you look this clean, I'm a classic man
Calling on me like a young OG, I'm a classic man
Your needs get met by the street, elegant old fashioned man
Yeah baby I'm a classic man


I burn through the gate like whoa
And everybody get in, we know
I love life, living like gold
And niggas wanna get in my glow
I got mad love for my crew, mu'fucker
I'm the- I'm the man, who you mu'fucker?
Shine bright like a jewel, mummafunka
Even under fire I'm cool, mummafunka

Even when she go away, even when she go away
Even when she go away, even when she go away


I'm a classic man
You can be mean when you look this clean, I'm a classic man
Calling on me like a young OG, I'm a classic man
Your needs get met by the street, elegant old fashioned man
Yeah baby I'm a classic man

Keep my gloves dirty but my hands clean
Got to keep the business in the family
Breadwinner filling up the pantry
Now my niggas slang cane like a dandy
I tell you how it go
You pull out rubber bands, I pull out an envelope
The ladies on my elbow ain't for the show
Every madame on my team is a top general, oh
Got to be ready for war, war
Should they get into my door, door?
Get 'em, we'll get 'em, I know that we'll get 'em
Cause I lived through this shit before, oh

I'm a classic man
You can be mean when you look this clean, I'm a classic man
Calling on me like a young OG, I'm a classic man
Your needs get met by the street, elegant old fashioned man
Yeah baby I'm a classic man

I'm a classic man
I'm a classic man
I'm a classic man
Old fashioned man
I'm a classic man
