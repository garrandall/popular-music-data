These red roses damn near turn to ashes
If I keep it real, you won't understand it
These dirty blogs got your mind damaged
I'll walk a million miles to see you happy

I hope she don't think, that I think
That she's some kind of hoe
(Some kind of hoe)
'Cause I don't care
That just lets me know that
She knows what she wants, yeah
Baby I won't judge (No, no, no, no)
Now I'm sure that
She knows what she wants, yea

I ain't gonna hold you baby, I like what i see
That print in them sweat pants got me weak off in my knees
I been thinking 'bout you since we met at No ID's
If you're free tonight I think that you should come see me
(Ohh, ohh)
Don't be scared of my aggression
(Ohh, ohh)
Just don't get the wrong impression

I hope she don't think, that I think
That she's some kind of hoe
(Some kind of hoe)
I don't care
That just lets me know that
She knows what she wants, yea
Baby I won't judge (No, no, no, no)
Now I'm sure that
She knows what she wants, yea (You like the way i wink at you?)

I can't never have a hater bone inside my body (Nope)
I just like it better when my girl do her Pilates (See?)
I wanna dress you up and have you fresher than a stylist
Think about any drama when your body traumatizing (Think about it)
You so caught up in the hype
You could have easily been my wife
I see the way your friends look they already thinking I'm shiesty (They jealous)
They misunderstood me when they say I'm Jesus Christ
I just want you to worship me, I like what I like
I'll feed you to the wolves if you don't talk to me nice
They gon try to crucify me
They think we worship Illuminati
I take my heart and I go hide it

After all I just hope he don't think that I'm some kind of hoe (Some kind of hoe)
I don't know, he just makes me feel like he knows what he wants, yea
Baby I won't judge
Now I'm sure that he knows what he wants, yea

I choose happiness over everything
Over anything and its everything
Happiness over everything
Over anything and it's everything to me
