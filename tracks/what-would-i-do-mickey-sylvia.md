If you leave me
What will I do?
Well I'd go to the river
Jump right in
Drown my tears
'Cause I can't win without you
Baby, that's what I'd do

If you leave me
What will I do?
Well I'd climb the mountain's highest peak
Jump into a burning heap
Without you
Baby, that's what I'd do

They say life's a bowl of cherries
Hmmm, hmmm, good
But what good are cherries
Or any wild berries
If love ain't what it should?

If you leave me
What would I do?
Hang my head down and cry
End my life
I'd die, die, die without you
Baby, that's what I'd do

They say life's a bowl of cherries
Hmmm, hmmm, good
But what good are cherries
Or any wild berries
If love ain't what it should?

If you leave me
What would I do?
Hang my head down and cry
End my life
I'd die, die, die without you
Baby, that's what I'd do

Yes, that's what I'd do
If I didn't have you
