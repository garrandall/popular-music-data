Never been safe, but I've never come closer
Another year down and another year older
A million fresh starts, what I needed was closure, yeah
I lost who I was, but I found my composure, yeah

When I found you, I found me
Nothing around, far as I could see
You were the current that carried me
When I found you, I found me
Lines in the sand, only you can read
My S.O.S., yeah, you rescued me
Rescued me

When I found you, I found me
Lines in the sand, only you can read
My S.O.S., yeah, you rescued me

Call it high-strung, started upping my dosage
We're way too young to be feeling this hopeless
You were my light in this endless ocean, yeah
Feeling alive, even just for this moment, yeah

When I found you, I found me
Nothing around, far as I could see
You were the current that carried me
When I found you, I found me
Lines in the sand, only you can read
My S.O.S., yeah, you rescued me
Rescued me

When I found you, I found me
Lines in the sand, only you can read
My S.O.S., yeah, you rescued me

You know my S.O.S.-O.S.
You know my S.O.S.-O.S.

When I found you, I found me
Nothing around, far as I could see
You were the current that carried me
When I found you, I found me
Lines in the sand, only you can read
My S.O.S., yeah, you rescued me
Rescued me

When I found you, I found me
Lines in the sand, only you can read
My S.O.S., yeah, you rescued me
Rescued me
