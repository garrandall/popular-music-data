Yeah yeah yeah...


Darlin, here we are again,
Right about now,
There is no need too tell you what I'm feelin'.
I'm so grateful,
To have a man like you,
Who knows what to do,
Makes me feel like a woman should...
Oh yeah...


When I close my eyes,
I break down and cry,
It's somethin 'bout the way you love me...
The thought of your kiss,
My heart can't resist,
It's all about the way you love me...


Never thought that I would find...
So much peace of mind,
And every moment that I share with you...
Sometimes I don't know why...
We fell so deep in love...
But then it all comes back to me because...




When I'm with you,
I feel so good
No one loves me like you...

When I close my eyes
