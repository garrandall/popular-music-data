In the city, I'm always awake
There's a symphony of music in the street
And I get high to drown it out
But it don't work, it just gets louder
In the city, in the city


The big apple took a bite out of me
Look what I turned out to be
I wonder if my mama really means it when she says that she's proud of me
Or is she tripping, is she lying
Is she on to all my lies? Mean that shit ain't rocket science
I've been coming home at four, and my eyes been red as sirens
I miss slurring all my words when she asked me how my night went
I swear it's them white boys, it's them white boys
Everything they do is so much doper than my life been
I don't got that type of money, I don't got that finance
She's like, why you so lazy trying to get by
Back before I smoked, I wasn't even tryna get high
Cigarette breaks at lunch time
Bong rips to my face, I passed out at Dave's place
In the morning tryna get right
Nigga's got a curfew, you ain't ready for these bright lights




You really changed, change is good
When you said don't let the city change you, I think it should
Come from different angles, see it different ways
I don't got the money, maybe we can make a trade
If I can make you laugh, you can spot me cash
What's the move on Tues? Yo I heard it's ave
These girls are kinda bougie, mom calls 'em fast
Some say you pretentious but I call it class
Prep school boys with their collars popped
Coming through the spot, always see you with your sleeves rolled up
Even with a uniform
I could never do the norm
How could I forget? I be on some shit
Now I rock sweats and I still get it
New kids never fit in, I wasn't any different
Had to get my mind right, wasn't ready for those bright lights




Let's do something dangerous
Break the rules, yeah let's shake it up
Let's do something dangerous
In the city that was made for us
