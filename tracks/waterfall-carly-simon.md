Something's going down like a waterfall
Some strong feeling's some old love
I saw you and it made no sense at all
Now I feel like there's too much caffeine in my blood

Like a waterfall goin' down
Like a waterfall washing me down
Spinnin' me around
Lord, and I'm drownin'
Like a waterfall going down
Just like a waterfall washing me down
Like a waterfall going down and down and down

You're an old lover making new contact
Making those cold defenses melt
And though lying in your arms is after the fact
Once again I'm feeling like I've never felt

it's like a waterfall going down
Like a waterfall washing me down
Spinnin'me round

Lord, and I'm drowning
Like a waterfall going down
Just like a waterfall washing me down
Like a waterfall going down and down and down
