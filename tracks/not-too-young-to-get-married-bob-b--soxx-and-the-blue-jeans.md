My momma said I can't see you no more
'Cause we don't know what love really means
She says we can't get married for three years or more
'Cause we're only in our teens

Chorus
Oh, no we're not too young, young to get married
Not too young, young to get married
What kind of difference can a few years make
I gotta have you now or my heart will break
Not too young, young to get married
Not too young, young to get married
I couldn't love you more than I do today

I remember when I brought you home
I remember what my mama said
When I told her that I loved you so
She told me I was out of my head

Repeat Chorus

I'm gonna love you 'til the day I die
I'm gonna spend every day with you
Don't they know the way they make me cry
When they carry on like they do

Repeat Chorus

Not too young, young to get married (Repeat and fade)
