Because I love you, yeah

Tells you they're your friend
But you know in the end

But I can sure feel it in my heart, hey
And I'm gonna do my best to keep it going strong
How can I go wrong lovin' you?

And I won't ever leave ya, mama
'Cause I love you, yeah I sure do, now - now - now

I can't believe I've finally found a love that's real
But, baby, I can sure feel it in my heart, oh yeah
And I'm gonna do my best, baby, to keep it going strong
