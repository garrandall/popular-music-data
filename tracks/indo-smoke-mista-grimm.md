Woo!, hey, this is the G-Child, spaceketeers
Are ya in the house baby, are ya in the house?
You know what I'm sayin, cuz it's that time
For you to kicks the funk online as we rewind
And then it will combine


Smokin' on the bud, feelin' kinda high
Sippin' on the gin, feelin' kinda fly
A Warren G production sits in the tape deck
As Mista Grimm raps over laps, don't say shit
Just, listen and recline for a spell
Pass the fat spliff back and forth (oh yeah)
Stuck, unable to breathe through the Chronic
Cloud that somehow prevents me from installin' fresh air


Ah, Indosmoke
Pass me the joint so I can take a toke
1 puff, 2 puff, 3 puff, 4 puff, 5 I'm feelin real high
Lean into the side in my muthafuckin' ride
With the O.G. gangsta glide
Woo!, hey now ya know
Inhale, exhale with my flow
Breakaway, come again like this
The LB to the C two times, don't miss
Cuz if you do, you break you get broke
Me and Mista G and the Indo Smoke


(Are you high yet?)
Whatever you do muthafucka you betta not choke
This ain't no stress, it's the muthafuckin' indo smoke


Fee, fi, foe, really doe
I'm still smokin' and sippin', talkin' like a pimp
Freakin', seekin' new lands without transport
Cuz indo smoke is a man's sport
I never feel stressed and that's the realist
Just a proper herb for my chronic illness
Please, let me go on with my day
Relax with phat tracks and a real fat J
Oh, I think I'm in love
Astounded from what it did, sended me far above
On a fly toke, I can brag for days
You can't swim with Grimm
Because my tidal wave's - high
And that's no joke
Because Mista Grimm takes flight from the Indo Smoke




Ignition to remission, blast off through the cos
Most of the voyage I enjoy is just a cause
I sonic boom when I return back to earth
Birth of a new rhyme will take no time
I'm prepared, papers and a lighter to provoke
A comical scene to watch Mista Grimm choke
Then gain composure, compose a symphony
From C-H-R-O-N-I-C and Mista G mixed together nicely
Combinin', lick the linings, voil√†!
A fat Chronic sack you can put in your jaw
H and R puff the stuff in ya lungs
Smokin' on the Chronic, gettin' straight sprung
Stretched, taken to the extreme feelin'
Dancin' on the ceilin' like Lionel
If ya hear me on some vinyl
I break 'em till they can't be broke
As I soak, in the Indo Smoke



Take a trip with Nate Dogg to the Eastside
We will show you where the gangstas love to get high
We get high on every street in Long Beach
So don't come to my hood thinkin' that you can fade me
Niggas from a funnyland wanna come to the East and reveal
I gotta viscious left hook and you're damn right I will steal
Shots go out to my nigga Mista Grimm and you know Warren G
I gotta nigga named Gangsta Rod, you know B-Tip, you know me
My name is Nate D-O double G and I'm comin' straight from the East
Don't think you don't know where I'm from, I'm from 213


Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'
19 ninety muthafuckin' 3 (hey)
I got my muthafuckin niggas in the house
I got my nigga Mista Grimm in the house (uh, ah)
I got my nigga B-Tip in the house (uh, ah)
I got my nigga Nate Dogg in the house (uh, ah)
I got my nigga Ricky Rod in the house (uh, ah)
I got the nigga Butch in the house (uh, ah)
I got my nigga Greg in the house (uh, ah)
He's engineering this, check it out
You know what I'm sayin'
Long Beach in the house
We hooked up with some people from West Covina
My nigga Mista Grimm, but you know
Ain't nothing but a G Thang, uh
G Thang, but you don't hear me though, hahaha yeah
Are you high yet? (laugh) (x2)

Are ya high big baby?
Are ya high? (laugh) (x2)

Nigga I asked you is you high (I'm fucked up)
I ain't be gotten no women, nigga is you high, shit (I'm fucked up)

Oh we can do this then
Hey, let's go
Its over big baby, hey
