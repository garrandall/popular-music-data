You were my conscience,
So solid, now you're like water
And we started drowning,
Not like we'd sink any further

But I let my heart go,
It's somewhere down at the bottom
But I'll get a new one
And come back for the hope that you've stolen

I'll stop the whole world,
I'll stop the whole world from turning into a monster eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder how we survive?
Well now that you're gone, the world is ours

I'm only human, I've got a skeleton in me
But I'm not the villain, despite what you're always preaching.

Call me a traitor,
I'm just collecting your victims
And they're getting stronger
I hear them calling, calling, calling

I'll stop the whole world,
I'll stop the whole world from turning into a monster eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder how we survive?
Well now that you're gone, the world is ours

Well you find your strength in solutions
But I like the tension
And not always knowing the answers
But you're gonna lose it,
You're gonna lose it

I'll stop the whole world,
I'll stop the whole world from turning into a monster eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder how we survive?
Well now that you're gone, the world...

I'll stop the whole world,
I'll stop the whole world from turning into a monster, eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder how we survive?
Now that you're gone, the world is ours.
