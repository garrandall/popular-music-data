Oh how happy you have made me
Oh how happy you have made me

I have kissed your lips a thousand times
And more times than I can count
I have called you mine
You have stood by me in my darkest hour

Oh how happy you have made me
Oh how happy you have made me
Oh how happy you have made me
Oh how happy you have made me

In our years together
We had stormy wearther
But our love has been so strong
But somehow we carry on

See, oh how happy you have made me
Oh how happy you have made me
Oh how happy you have made me
Oh how happy you have made me

You brought joy to my empty life
And all that's wrong you made it right
My love, our love, my love, yeah, yeah
