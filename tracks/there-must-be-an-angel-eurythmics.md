No one on Earth could feel like this
I'm thrown and overblown with bliss
There must be an Angel
Playing with my heart

I walk into an empty room
And suddenly my heart goes boom
It's an orchestra of Angels
And they're playing with my heart, yeah

Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel

No one on Earth could feel like this
I'm thrown and overblown with bliss
There must be an Angel
Playing with my heart

And when I think that I'm alone
It seems there's more of us at home 
It's a multitude of Angels
And they're playing with my heart

Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel

I must be hallucinating
Watching Angels celebrating
Could this be reactivating
All my senses dislocating
This must be a strange deception
By celestial intervention
Leaving me the recollection
Of your heavenly connection

Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel

I walk into an empty room
And suddenly my heart goes boom
It's an orchestra of Angels
They're playing with my heart

Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel

Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
