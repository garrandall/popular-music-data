To who do you do the thing to do
When it's time to do it
No matter to who

But there's nobody there to do it but you
And what isn't that has to be done
Is a puzzle in song

Now how do you know
If you know how to do
Whatever it is to be done by you

If there's nobody there to do it to
And what isn't that has to be done
Is a puzzle in song

Peter Piper picked
A peck of pickled peppers
Can't compare with trying to
Figure out the puzzle song

Holding your tongue and saying
Molasses on the table isn't as hard
As trying to figure out the puzzle song

Supposing you find the answer to
To who do you do the thing to do
The puzzle is still is a puzzle to you
Is what isn't that has to be done
Is a puzzle in song

Peter Piper picked
A peck of pickled peppers
Can't compare with trying to
Figure out the puzzle song

Holding your tongue and saying
Molasses on the table isn't as hard
As trying to figure out the puzzle song

Supposing you find the answer to
To who do you do the thing to do
The puzzle is still is a puzzle to you
Is what isn't that has to be done
Is a puzzle in song

Is what isn't that has to be done
Is a puzzle in song
Is what isn't that has to be done
Is a puzzle in song
Is what isn't that has to be done
Is a puzzle in song...
