Well I look out the window and what do I see
The breeze is a blowin' the leaves from the trees everything is free everything but me
I'm gonna take this chain from around my finger
And throw it just as far as I can slinger cause I wanna be free
When my baby left me everything died
But a little bluebird was singin' just outside singin' twidle-de-dee fly away with me
Well you know I think I'm a gonna live gotta lotta love left in me to give
So I wanna be free
I released my heart my soul and my mind and I'm a feelin' fine
I broke the chains the ring of gold before it broke my mind
Well look who's cryin' and it ain't me but I can't hardly hear and I can't have see
Oh I wanna be free
I released my heart my soul...
Do I wanna be free yeah I wanna be free free
