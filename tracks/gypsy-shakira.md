Broke my heart on the road
Spent the weekend sewing the pieces back on
Crayons and dolls pass me by
Walking gets too boring when you learn how to fly

Not the homecoming kind
Take the top off and who knows what you might find
Won't confess all my sins
You can bet all trying but you can't always win

'Cause I'm a gypsy
Are you coming with me?
I might steal your clothes and wear them if they fit me
Never made agreements
Just like a gypsy
And I won't back down 'cause life's already bit me
And I won't cry
I'm too young to die
If you're gonna quit me
'Cause I'm a gypsy

('Cause I'm a gypsy)

I can't hide what I've done
Scars remind me of just how far that I've come
To whom it may concern
Only run with scissors when you want to get hurt

'Cause I'm a gypsy
Are you coming with me?
I might steal your clothes and wear them if they fit me
I don't make agreements
Just like a gypsy
And I won't back down 'cause life's already bit me
And I won't cry
I'm too young to die
If you're gonna quit me
'Cause I'm a gypsy

And I say
"Hey, you! You're no fool if you say 'No'"
Ain't it just the way life goes?
People fear what they don't know

Come along for the ride (oh, yeah)
Come along for the ride (ooh)

'Cause I'm a gypsy
Are you coming with me?
I might steal your clothes and wear them if they fit me
Never made agreements
Just like a gypsy
And I won't back down 'cause life's already bit me
And I won't cry
I'm too young to die
If you're gonna quit me
'Cause I'm a gypsy
