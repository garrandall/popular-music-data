Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Now if there's a smile on my face
It's only there trying to fool the public
But when it comes down to fooling you
Now honey, that's quite a different subject

But don't let my glad expression
Give you the wrong impression
Really, I'm sad
Oh, I'm sadder than sad
You're gone and I'm hurtin' so bad
Like a clown I pretend to be glad

Now there's some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around

Oh yeah, baby

Now if I appear to be carefree
It's only to camouflage my sadness
In order to shield my pride I've tried
To cover this hurt with a show of gladness

But don't let my show convince you
That I've been happy since you
Decided to go
Oh, I need you so
I'm hurt and I want you to know
But for others I put on a show

Oh, there's some sad things known to man
But there ain't too much sadder than
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around, oh yeah

Just like Pagliacci did
I try to keep my sadness hid
Smiling in the public eye
But in my lonely room I cry
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around

Oh yeah, baby

Now if there's a smile on my face
Don't let my glad expression
Give you the wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear
Make you think that I don't care
Really, I'm sad
Hurtin' so bad
