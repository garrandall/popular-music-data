I don't want to lose you
This good thing, that I got
'Cause if I do, I will surely
Surely lose a lot

'Cause your love, is better
Than any love I know
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
Oh you better knock, knock

On wood, baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I'm not superstitious, about ya
But I can't take no chance
You got me spinnin' baby
You know that I'm in a trance

'Cause your love, is better
Than any love I know
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightenin'
Oh you better knock, knock, knock

On wood, baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

(Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think I better knock)

Ooh baby

It's no secret, about it
'Cause with his lovin' touch
He sees to it
That I get enough

Feel his touch, all over
You know it means so much
It's like thunder, first then lightnin'
The way you love me is frightenin'
You better knock, knock, knock

On wood, baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

(Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood)
(Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood)
