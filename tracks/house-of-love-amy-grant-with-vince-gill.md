Chorus:
Well, I bet you any amount of money
He'll be coming back to you
Ooh, I know there ain't no doubt about it
Sometimes life is funny
You think you're in your darkest hour
When the lights are coming on in the house of love

Ooh, house of love

You've been up all night
Thinking it was over
He's been out of sight
At least for the moment
But when something this strong
Ooh, Gets a hold on you
The odds are ninety-nine to one
It's got a hold on him too

(Repeat Chorus)
When the lights are coming on in the house of love

Now when the house is dark
And you're all alone inside
You've gotta listen to your heart
And put away your foolish pride
Though the storm is breaking
And thunder shakes the walls
Love with a firm foundation
Ain't never, never, never gonna fall

(Repeat Chorus)
Though the storm is breaking
And thunder shakes the walls
Love with a firm foundation
Ain't never, never, never gonna fall

Well, I bet you any amount of money
He'll come back to you
Ooh, I know there ain't no doubt about it
Sometimes life is funny
You think you're in your darkest hour
When the lights are coming, lights are coming on

Well, I bet you any amount of money, baby
He'll be coming back to you
Back to you, back to you
Ooh, I know there ain't no doubt about it
Sometimes life is funny
You think you're in your darkest hour
When the lights are coming on in the house of love
Oooh, yeah
Ooh, I know there ain't no doubt about it
Sometimes life is funny
You think you're in your darkest hour
When the lights are coming on in the house of love
