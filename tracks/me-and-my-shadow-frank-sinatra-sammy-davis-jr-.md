Johnny and Robbie
Youth, why you talking like that? We're from Stoke!
I know, but I can't stop here pally!

Like the wallpaper sticks to the wall
And like the seashore clings to the sea
Like you'll never get rid of your shadow
You'll never get rid of me
Let all the others fight and fuss
Whatever happens, we've got us

Closer than pages that stick in a book
We're closer than ripples that flow in a brook
Wherever you find him, you'll find me just look
Closer than a miser
Or the bloodhounds to Liza me

Closer than smog gets to all of L.A
Closer than Ricky to confessing he's gay
Not a soul can bust this team in two
We stick together like glue

When it's sleeping time
That's when we rise
We start to swing
You think you're so jazz, you
Clocks don't chime
What a surprise
They ring-a-ding-ding
Happy New Year

And now to repeat what I said at the start
They'll need a large crowbar to break us apart
We're alone but far from blue

Before we get finished, we'll make the town roar
We'll hit a few late spots
And then a few more
We'll start off at Stringy's and maybe Groucho
Life is gonna be a wow-wow-we
For my shadow and me

Can we do that again?
No, I'm too tired
Oh please Rob
No, I'm swung out
Oh come on, I'll give you some money
I don't need money
What about a cup of tea?
Not thirsty
I won't tell anybody you're gay
Oh fuck

Before we get finished, we'll make the town roar
We'll hit all the late spots
And then a few more
We'll start out at Stringy's and maybe Groucho
Life is gonna be a wow-wow-we
For my shadow and me
