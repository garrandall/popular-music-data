Flash, flashes
Flash,  flashes
Flash,  flashes
Flash, flashes

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh,  Sylvia
Here's  a picture of those days we used to dance away
Wishing we were older
White  bobby socks
Just remember boy, all those skin and legs we used to see
In front at the Motorola (In front of Motorola)
Can't just deny the memory

Flashes,  feeling them some more
Flashes, memories again
Flashes, the way it used to be
Flashes, seeing memories, flashes
Flashes
Memories of the town all dancing in the street
Flashes, flashes

Where's Romeo
Whatever happened to him
Heard he's gone and married a black girl
Now they're living in West Virginia
In the class yearbook
I hate to take a look
Let's turn by the haunted 
And crank up the old victrola (crank up the victrola)
Can't just deny the memory

Flashes, feeling them some more
Flashes, memories again
Flashes, the way it used to be
Flashes, seeing memories, flashes
Flashes
Memories of the town all dancing in the street
Flashes, flashes

Flash bop!

(Flashes)
(Flash bop)
(Flash, Flashes)
(Flash, Flashes)
(Flash, Flashes)
(Flash, Flashes)

Flashes, feeling them some more
Flashes, memories again
Flashes, the way it used to be
Flashes, seeing memories, flashes
Flashes
Memories of the town all dancing in the street
Flashes, flashes
Flashes
Flashes
Memories of the town all dancing in the street
Flashes, flash
Flash flash
