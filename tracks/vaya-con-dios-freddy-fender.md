Now the hacienda's dark, the town is sleeping
Now the time has come to part, the time for weeping
Vaya con Dios, my darling
May God be with you my love

Wherever you may be, I'll be beside you
Although you're many million dreams away
Each night I'll say a pray'r, a pray'r to guide you
To hasten every lonely hour of every lonely day

Now the dawn is breaking through a gray tomorrow
But the memories we share are there to borrow
Vaya con Dios, my darling
May God be with you my love

Now the village mission bells are softly ringing
If you listen with your heart you'll hear them singing
Vaya con Dios, my darling
May God be with you my love

Wherever you may be I'll be beside you
Although you're many million dreams away
Each night I'll say a pray'r, a pray'r to guide you
To hasten every lonely hour of every lonely day

Now the dawn is breaking through a gray tomorrow
But the memories we share are there to borrow
Vaya con Dios, my darling
Vaya con Dios, my love
