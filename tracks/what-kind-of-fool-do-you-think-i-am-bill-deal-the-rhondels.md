What kind of fool do you think I am
You think you're gonna go on seeing him
Darling, after we made all our plans
You said I'd be your number one man

What kind of fool (what kind of fool)
(Do you think I am)
Do you think I am now (think I am)

What kind of fool did you think I'd be
You said you really, really, really loved me
You run around all over town
You build me up and then you let me down

What kind of fool (what kind of fool)
(Do you think I am)
Do you think I am now (think I am)

I won't be your second choice
I've got to be your number one
Or I ain't gonna love you at all

What kind of fool did you think I'd be
You said you really, really, really loved me
You run around all over town
You build me up and then you let me down

What kind of fool (what kind of fool)
(Do you think I am)
Do you think I am now (think I am)

What kind of fool
(What kind of fool do you think I am)
Do you think I am now
(What kind of fool do you think I am)

What kind of fool
(What kind of fool do you think I am)
Do you think I am now
(What kind of fool do you think I am)

What do you think I am
(What kind of fool do you think I am)
What do you think I am now
(What kind of fool do you think I am)
