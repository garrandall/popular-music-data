Oh, off with ya clothes with the cure

Oh Babylon a chat to me funny

Oh, you wanna make 'nuf dough
Oh Popular me everywhere me go
Oh, you wanna live like star
Off with ya clothes with the cure




It's a bigger o'ting, cha

Feed Ma' Motion

Music is from the sheet
Designed to make you
Move your feet and
Feed Mama Oshun

And then on and then on

Oh, you wanna make 'nuf dough
Oh Popular me everywhere me go
Oh, you wanna live like star
Off with ya clothes with the cure
