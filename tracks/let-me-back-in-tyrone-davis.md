Aww, she didn't bat an eye ss I packed my bags to leave
I thought she would start to cry or sit around my room and grieve
But y'all, the girl, she fooled me this time
She acted like I was the last thing on her mind

I would like to start all over again
Baby, can I change my mind
I just wanna change my mind
Baby, let me change my mind

As I took those steps toward that open door
Knowing all the time, oh, Lord, I just didn't wanna go
But she didn't give me no sign
Nothing that would make me change my mind

I would like to start all over again
Baby, can I change my mind
Please, please, please, baby
I just wanna change my mind

Oh, I played my games many times before
But peoples, let me tell y'all, oh, I never reached the door
But ooh, the winds howl tonight
I keep lookin' back, but my baby's nowhere in sight

I would like to start all over again
Baby, can I change my mind
Please, please, please, baby
Baby, let me change my mind
