Oh, I know you're surprised, girl
To see me knocking at your door
We had a little misunderstanding
I packed my bags and left and said
I wouldn't be back no more

I went straight to another woman
Who I thought wanted me
But when she found out I had lost you
She got cold as she could be

She said, as far as she was concerned
That, uh, we were through
And I might as well turn around
And go on back to you

So I'm standing here knocking, baby
(Standing here knocking)
(Standing here knocking)
Please, let me in

(Standing here knocking)
(Standing here knocking)

I'm standing here knocking, baby
(Standing here knocking)
(Standing here knocking)
Please, let me in

(Standing here knocking)
(Standing here knocking)

Oh, you don't realize
How much it hurt me, girl
To have to look into your eyes

But I got to come back home, baby
Even though I know it's
Gonna hurt my pride

That other woman
She just messed up my mind
She didn't really love me
She was only wasting time

I was just a fool
To believe that she was wrong
She was only jealous of you, baby
And trying to mess up our home

I'm standing here knocking, baby
(Standing here knocking)
(Standing here knocking)
Please, let me in

(Standing here knocking)
(Standing here knocking)

I'm standing here knocking, baby
(Standing here knocking)
(Standing here knocking)
Please, let me in

(Standing here knocking)
(Standing here knocking)

I love you, baby
Please open up
The door for me, honey
I need you

(Standing here knocking)
(Standing here knocking)

Please let me come back in, baby
I know, I know that I was wrong
Honey, listen to me, baby
I love you

(Standing here knocking)
(Standing here knocking)

Baby, baby, I love you so much
