There's a churchhouse, gin house, schoolhouse, outhouse
On the U.S. 19, hey the people keep the city clean
They call it Nutbush, ah Nutbush
Nutbush city, Nutbush city limits

25 is the speed limit, motorcycles not allowed in it
Go to town on Saturday, go to church every Sunday
Nutbush city, Nutbush city limits

No whiskey for sale, can't find a female
Salt pork and molasses, all your gonna get if you end in jail
Nutbush city, Nutbush city limits

Work the fields every weekday, have a picnic every Labor Day
Go in town on Friday, be in church every Sunday
Nutbush city, Nutbush city limit

A little old town, down in Tennessee

Quiet community, a real quiet southern community
Not much ever happens in Nutbush, ah no
You can hear the corn grow,
Got to watch out for the police
Drivin' through nutbush
Better watch out for the police
Better watch out for the police
Keep an eye out for the police

Nutbush city limit, Nutbush city limit
