Talk to me
Talk to me
Talk to me tonight about love

Hey now just what are we feeling
Is this more than attraction that we both are dealing with?
And is it in the cards that we stay together?
I recognize the odds against it lasting forever

There's a message that you're sending
I can see it in your eyes
But I don't know what you're thinking
I can't read your heart or mind

Come with me we'll make tonight a fantasy
If you say the word, I'll take you on a journey

Talk to me, tell me what's on your mind
Talk to me, what are you feeling inside
Talk to me, what are you thinking of
Talk to me, tonight about love

Come and talk to me, my baby
Come and talk to me

Oh, hold me right up against you
Cause when you groove up close to me
I'm feeling your rhythm
Just whisper in my ear what's going on inside you
I just wanna hear if you're feeling like I do

Open up your heart there's nothing I want more
Show me the light and tell me what you came here for

Don't keep it to yourself, just improvise (just improvise)
Lose yourself, let out what you're feeling inside



There's a message that you're sending
I can see it in your eyes
But I don't know what you're thinking
I can't read your heart or mind
If you wanna make tonight a fantasy
Just say the word I'll take you on a journey

Talk to me, tell me what's on your mind
Talk to me, what are you feeling inside
Talk to me, what are you thinking of
Talk to me, tonight about love

Talk to me, tell me that you want this
Talk to me, baby just move your lips
Talk to me, what are you thinking of
Talk to me, tonight about love

Come and talk to me, my baby
Come and talk to me
