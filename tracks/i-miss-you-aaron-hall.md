I miss you
I'm talking to you baby
I miss you

I miss you
I'm talking to you baby
I miss you

We used to talk
And laugh all night girl
What happened to those days?
Did they all just fade away
Holding you in my arms
Made me feel so happy
Then you said you had to go
What's wrong, baby, I need to know

But now it's a dream
(Now it's a dream)
That I wish you could come
Back and make come true
(Come back to make come true)
But you're long gone away
(Come on back baby)
But now I'm missing you
(I miss you, yes I do
From the bottom of my heart)

I miss you (oh yes I do)
I'm talking to you, baby
(hear me when I say)
I miss you (I miss you yes I do, yes I do)
I miss you (oh)
I'm talking to you, baby
(I'm talking to you)
I miss you (only to you, baby)

I thought you'd be with me forever
But I guess someone took my place
Took the place of me loving you
And making love to you all through the night
I wish you were still here
So I can see your pretty face again
Please come back and rescue me
From all this pain and misery

But now it's a dream
(now is a dream)
And I wish you
Could come back to make us true
(come back to make us true)
But you're long gone away
(but you're long gone away, baby)
But now I'm missing you
(I miss you, oh, yes I do, baby)

(Missing you) missing you
(The way you used to hold me)
Missing you
(Heyy, hey)
Please understand how much
I really miss you
I'll do anything in this world
To have you back again
Missing you
(I miss you)
Missing you
(Hey, hey, hey I do)
I miss you through winter, spring
The summer & the fall
When we were together (Oh, yea)

I miss you, I miss you
From the bottom of my heart
To the depths of my soul, baby
I miss you, oh
Give me the love back baby
The way you used to hold me
The way you used to kiss me
I, I, I miss you
I miss you Yes, I do
Yes I do - I miss you
Yes I do, yes I do
(Hey, hey)
I miss you, I really, really do
I really, really do
(Can I teel you, can I tell you how much I miss you baby)
I miss you, yes I do, yes I do
I miss you so bad
(I miss you)
Everytime I lay at night, all I do is cry
I do love you baby

I miss you (yes I do, yes I do)
I miss you (yea) yes I do, yes I do
I'm talking to you baby (call me
Call me baby, call me baby, come
Give your loving back to me)
(I miss you) yes, I do, yes I do
I miss you (yes, I do, yes I do)
I'm talking to you baby
(show me those pretty eyes)
I miss you (please, baby don't you cry)
I miss you (hold me all night long)
I miss you (squeeze me make me warm)
I miss you (oh, I miss you, your soft, sweet, soft, sweet, sexy body)
I miss you
I miss you
