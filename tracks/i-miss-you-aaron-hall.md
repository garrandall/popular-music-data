If it's stupid enough, it's cool
A1-a2-a3

We figure, my daddy and me
Things are still the same, it seems
As when he lived it in his teens
As a kid in school

Aaron was a junior, the class of '32
His momma called him angel
But everybody knew he was the
King king, the gross out king

They called him Piss Aaron
They always caught him pissin' in the hall
Piss Aaron, he never would refuse
When nature called

Dumb Larry from Homeroom 9
Kept his locker full of weeds
Just to satisfy his smoking needs
And his love of fire

Went to a game and lit
A stink bomb in the bleachers
The coach, the cheerleader and the
The chem teacher, and the dean
The dean, duh, dean dean was after

Dumb Larry, they always caught him
Smokin' in the john
Dumb Larry, you never would have
Missed him when he's gone

Chuck Biscuits, conservative-jive
The biggest pig in all the school
He would sit and smack his lips and drool
As he eyed your lunch
I left a bag in his desk one night

A raw egg sandwich and
When Hungry took a bite
He had to up chuck
Uh up up-chuck, a-pukin'

Chuck Biscuits, they always
Caught him eatin' in the class

Dumb Larry, they always caught him
Smokin' in the john

Piss Aaron, they always
Caught him pissin' in the hall
