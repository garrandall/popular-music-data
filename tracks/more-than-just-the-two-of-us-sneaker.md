There are times when all your love is meant for me
Then you're the wind, alone and free
Our love is more than you and me

And you're the one I can give myself away
And I'm the one who calls your name
In the quiet of a dream

It's more than just the two of us
And we just have to keep holding on, holding on
More than just the two of us
And we just have to keep holding on, holding on

In your touch come the words so hard to say
And in your very special way
You can make me understand

In my eyes you are the warmth of the sun
And after all is said and done
Our love is more than you and me

It's more than just the two of us
And we just have to keep holding on, holding on
More than just the two of us
And we just have to keep holding on, holding on

In my eyes you are the warmth of the sun
And after all is said and done
Our love is more than you and me

It's more than just the two of us
And we just have to keep holding on, holding on
More than just the two of us
And we just have to keep holding on, holding on

It's more than just the two of us
And we just have to keep holding on, holding on
More than just the two of us
And we just have to keep holding on, holding on
