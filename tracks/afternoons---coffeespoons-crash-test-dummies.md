What is it that makes me just a little bit queasy?
There's a breeze that makes my breathing not so easy
I've had my lungs checked out with X-rays
I've smelled the hospital hallways

Someday I'll have a disappearing hairline
Someday I'll wear pajamas in the daytime

Times when the day is like a play by Sartre
When it seems a book burning's in perfect order
I gave the doctor my description
I've tried to stick to my prescription

Someday I'll have a disappearing hairline
Someday I'll wear pajamas in the daytime

Woahh, afternoons will be measured out
Measured out, measured with
Coffeespoons and T.S. Eliot

Maybe if I could do a play-by-playback
I could change the test results that I will get back
I've watched the summer evenings pass by
I've heard the rattle in my bronchi...

Someday I'll have a disappearing hairline
Someday I'll wear pajamas in the daytime

Woahh, afternoons will be measured out
Measured out, measured with
Coffeespoons and T.S. Eliot

Afternoons will be measured out
Measured out, measured with
Coffeespoons and T.S. Eliot
