Girl, you're welcome...stop on by
You know I'll be here, baby
To dry your eyes, to dry your eyes
But I'm gettin' tired of being that second guy
Don't you be no fool, baby
You 'bout to lose your old standby

Is it the material things that he's givin'
Can you truly say that you're happy livin'
True love, I'm the one that's giving
I'm tryin' to keep from hurtin' your feelings
Oh, baby, stop on, stop on, stop on by

Girl, you're welcome, stop on by
One day, one day, one day one day, one day
I might even want to make you cry
Don't take for granted
I'll always be there
â€˜Cause there's some woman somewhere
That could truly need me (think about it, baby)

Is it the material things that the man is givin'
Can you truly say that you're happy livin'
True love, I'm the one that's giving
I'm tryin' to keep from hurtin' your feelings
Oh , stop on, stop on, stop by, stop on by
