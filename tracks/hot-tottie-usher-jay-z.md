Big ballin is my hobby
So much so they think I'm down with the illuminati
My watch do illuminate
My pockets are naughty
But I'm God body better ask somebody
I was born a God
I made myself a king
Which means I downgraded to a human being
You was born a Goddess I made you my queen
Which mean we upgraded to Louis the thirteen
Hot toddy her body like cognac
Her momma like earth tea
We birthed a couple of sacks
And as the teeth speaks I greet all in the tipi
We did it Indian style had the girls speaking
In tongue she like young you hung what you done done
Stop it fore you wake up my momma might (ahhhh)
And now that I've arrived it's time that you go...
I'm so cold I'm so cold...


That I'm tryna get your clothes off
From what I'm seeing you look so soft
Is your body what I'm going on?
Yeah I done had a lot of women that tell me what they do
But can you show me babe
Yeah you got me right
