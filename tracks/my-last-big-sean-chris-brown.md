Hands up in the air
I just want the
I just want the baddest bitch in the world
Right here on my lap

And I'm a hit this drink up like it's my last
I'm a, I'm a hit this night up like it's my last
I'm a, I'm a hit this ass up, like it's my last
I swear I'm a, swear I'm a do it like
Like I, like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
Like I, like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all


Ok, now where that alcohol
You ain't even got to ask
Cause I'm a drink it all like, like it's my last
She a 7 in the face, but a 10 in the ass
She even look better by the end of my glass
See I just walked in fresher than the shirts off in this muthafucka
I'm a, I'm a need a baddest broad to twirk off in this muthafucka
I'm a go hard till it hurts off in this muthafucka
I'm a ball so you gotta work off in this muthafucka
The work, and I can get you anything you want
I could, I could, I could, I could put you on
See you look like Beyonce so do it like Beyon...
Do it, do it like Beyonce and put it on Sean
Grind hard but got a lot to show for it
Always had drive like I had to chauffeur it
My team's so true we should get a camera crew
To follow us around and make a show for us


And I'm a hit this drink up like it's my last
I'm a, I'm a hit this night up like it's my last
I'm a, I'm a hit this ass up, like it's my last
I swear I'm a, swear I'm a do it like
Like I, like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
Like I, like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
All, all, all, all, all all all all
Like I, like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all


Now, I'm a fill this glass up like it's my last
I'm a, I'm a blow dis backup like it's my last
I'm a, I'm a spend this cash up like it's my last
And I'm a make it last, like it's my last
And I'm gone, can't remember where I am
But she forget about her man when they tell her who I am
And they introduce my fan
Now she all up in space
All, all up in my face like "you remember who I am"
Since I signed to Kan', I'm Louie Vuitton shine
Up in Benny Han Han eating all the Wonton (what's good)
Rozay rose or a little Chandon
Put her hands down my pants now she rocking Sean John
Man I just ended up on er'body guestlist
I'm just doing better than what everyone projected
I Knew that I'd be here so if you asked me how I feel
I'm a just tell you, it's everything that I expected
Bitch!

(Boi, Boi) 


Hands up in the air
(One time for the West side, west side, let me see them)
Hands up in the air
(Two times, two times if you love good music)
Hands up in the air
(And three times for the baddest chick in the World who got her)
Hands up in the air


I'm a hit this drink up like it's my last
I'm a, I'm a hit this night up like it's my last
I'm a, I'm a hit this ass up, like it's my last
I swear I'm a, swear I'm a do it like
Like I, like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
Like I, like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all


Big ass bottles, big ice buckets
I work too hard to be ballin' on a budget
Me and my people do it big out in public
Cause if you don't do it big
Bitch you ain't doing nothing


And I'm a hit this drink up like it's my last
I'm a, I'm a hit this night up like it's my last
I'm a, I'm a hit this ass up, like it's my last
I swear I'm a, swear I'm a do it like
Like I, like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
Like I, like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
All, all, all, all, all all all all
Like I, like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
