Hearts away, I cast my heart
To some romantic yesterday
When I was young and on my own
And you were blind to everyone but me

Now today, I throw my heart to some
Forgotten memory, when you were
What was meant for me, a stranger
With a place to always be

Hearts away (x3)

Cast away, I cast my heart away each
Time I think I see
Your face come down a crowded avenue
How come it's never really you
And today, I cry myself to sleep each night
I only wish, I'd wake to see you lying next to me
I know I'm sure it's killing me

Hearts away (x3)

Oh I wanna know
All the times I held you near me
Did you think I'd ever let you go now
And the time I had you with me
Did you feel so sorry for the lonely ones
Are we the only ones
Hearts away

Now today I throw my heart
To some forgotten memory
When you were what was meant for me
A stranger with a place to always be

Hearts away (x4)
