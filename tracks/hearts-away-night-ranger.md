Taking the time, embracing the high
It's never too late like floating on clouds in the sky
With nothing on your mind, oh yeah

Finding that sound, it carries you through
It's a fortress surrounding your soul
It's the passion in you and nobody can take that away
No, no, now listen

Open your mind, it's always in your life
Greet a brand new day, let it carry you

(Follow your heart)
Can you discover the light that burns bright in you
Hang on forever, there's no one that shines like you

The wheel keeps on turning
The meaning of love
Is sometimes obscured by the darkness
Of the light from above

And if that's not enough
We got something that goes like this

The story of you was written long before
The world was around
I hear the sound of your footsteps at my bedroom door
And it's gonna be so much more, that's right

Open your mind, it's always been your life
You gotta live for today 

(Follow your heart)
Can you discover the light that burns bright in you
(Follow your heart)
Hang on forever, there's no one that shines like you

Can we find enough shadows
Like floating on clouds in the sky
No one shines like you, hey

(Follow your heart)
Can you discover the light that burns bright in you
(Follow your heart)
Hang on forever, there's no one that shines like you

(Follow your heart)
Can you discover the light that burns bright in you
(Just follow your heart)
Hang on forever, there's no one that shines like you
Just follow your heart

Open your mind, it's always been your life
You gotta live for today
