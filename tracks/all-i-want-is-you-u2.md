You say you want
Diamonds on a ring of gold
You say you want
Your story to remain untold


But all the promises we make
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you


You say you'll give me
A highway with no-one on it
Treasure, just to look upon it
All the riches in the night


You say you'll give me
Eyes in the moon of blindness
A river in a time of dryness
A harbour in the tempest


But all the promises we make
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you


You say you want
Your love to work out right
To last with me through the night


You say you want
Diamonds on a ring of gold
Your story to remain untold
Your love not to grow cold


All the promises we break
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you


You, all I want is
You, all I want is
You, all I want is
You
