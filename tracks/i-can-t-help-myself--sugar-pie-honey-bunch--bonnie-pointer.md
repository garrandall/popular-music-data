Sugarpie honeybunch
You know that I love you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else
In and out my life
You come and you go
Leaving just your picture behind
And I kissed it a thousand times

When you snap your fingers
Or wink your eye
I come a running to you
I'm tied to your apron strings
And there's nothing I can do

Oh, sugarpie honeybunch
I'm weaker than a girl should be
I can't help myself
I'm a fool in love, you see
Wanna tell you I don't love you
Tell you that we're through
And I've tried
But everytime I see your face
I get up all choked up inside

Oh, sugarpie honeybunch
You know that I love you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else

When I call your name, boy
It starts the flame burning in my heart
Tearin' it all apart
No matter how I try
My love I cannot hide

Oh, sugarpie honeybunch
I'm weaker than a girl should be
I can't help myself
I'm a fool in love, you see
Wanna tell you I don't love you
Tell you that we're through
And I've tried
But everytime I see your face
I get up all choked up inside

Sugarpie honeybunch
You now that I'm weak for you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else

Oh, sugarpie honeybunch
I'm weaker than a girl should be
I can't help myself
I'm a fool in love, you see

Sugar
Honey
I can't help myself
Oh, I can't help myself

Sugarpie honeybunch
You know that I love you
