Hey girl, you make me wanna write a song,
Sit you down, I'll sing it to you all night long,
I've had a melody in my head
Since she walked in here and knocked me dead.
Yeah girl, you make me wanna write a song

And it goes like oh,
What I wouldn't do
To write my name on your heart,
Get you wrapped in my arms
Baby all around you.
And it goes like hey,
Girl I'm blown away,
Yeah it starts with a smile and it ends with an all night long slow kiss,
Yeah it goes like this.

Hey girl, you make me wanna drive you home,
Get you outta here and get you all alone.
I don't know what it is about you, baby,
But I'm all messed up and it might sound crazy,
But you make me wanna write a song.

And it goes like oh,
What I wouldn't do,
To write my name on your heart,
Get you wrapped in my arms
Baby all around you.
And it goes like hey,
Girl I'm blown away,
Yeah it starts with a smile and it ends with an all night long slow kiss,
Yeah it goes like this.

Lookin' at you, lookin' at me that way,
Makes me wanna grab my old guitar and play

Something like oh,
What I wouldn't do,
To write my name on your heart,
Get you wrapped in my arms
Baby all around you.
And it goes like hey,
Girl I'm blown away,
Yeah it starts with a smile and it ends with an all night long slow kiss,
Yeah it goes like this

And it goes like oh,
And it goes like hey,
And it ends with a kiss,
Yeah it goes like this.
