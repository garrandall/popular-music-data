So open up your morning light
And say a little prayer for I
You know that if we are to stay alive
Then see the peace in every eye


Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo


She had two babies, one was six months, one was three
In the war of '44
Every telephone ring, every heartbeat stinging
When she thought it was God calling her
Oh, would her son grow to know his father?


I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
I want to know right now what will it be
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be sorry


Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo


He showed up all wet on the rainy front step
Wearing shrapnel in his skin
And the war he saw lives inside him still
It's so hard to be gentle and warm
The years pass by and now he has granddaughters


I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
I want to know right now what will it be
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be


Ohhh, so look at me from across the room
You're wearing your anguish again
Believe me I know the feeling
It sucks you into the jaws of anger
Ohhh, so breathe a little more deeply
All we have is this very moment
And I don't want to do what his father
And his father, and his father did
I want to be here now


So open up your morning light
And say a little prayer for I
You know that if we are to stay alive
Then see the peace in every eye


I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
I want to know right now what will it be
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
I want to know right now what will it be
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be sorry


Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo


So open up your morning light
And say a little prayer for I
You know that if we are to stay alive
Then see the love in every eye
