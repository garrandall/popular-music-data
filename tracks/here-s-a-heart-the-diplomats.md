Oh, I meet her on the street
Talk to her in my sleep
And I see her face
Her pretty, pretty face

(CHORUS)
And I said (here's a heart)
Here's a heart (a pure, pure heart)
And I (give my heart to her)

She cast an eye into my direction
Oh, me, oh, my
Ain't that perfection
And I see her face
Her pretty, pretty face

(CHORUS) 2X

Here's a heart
I'm gonna give it all to you
Take me as I am
I want you to take me as I am

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Take me, take me
I want you to take me
