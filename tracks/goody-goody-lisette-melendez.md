The vibe you send me
Reaches deep inside
Subliminally
Your words they gently whisper
Sweet nothings to me

Why don't you make your move
Set it off baby
Me and you
All I wanna do is to get with you
Take you around the world
The night through


(Do you want it right now)
(I can show you how)
Yeah
Follow me to a world
Where our hearts can run free
(Do you want it right now)
(I can show you how)

Love will find a way
Tell me
