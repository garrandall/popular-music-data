Of course we have our differences, you shouldn't be surprised.
It's as natural as changes in the seasons and the skies.
Sometimes we grow together, sometimes we drift apart,
a wiser man than I might know the seasons of the heart.

And I'm walking here beside you in the early evening chill.
a thing we've always loved to do, I know we always will.
We have so much in common, so many things we share,
that I can't believe my heart when it implies that you're not there.
Love is why I came here in the first place, love is now the reason I must go.
Love is all I ever hoped to find here, love is still the only dream I know.

So I don't know how to tell you, it's difficult to say.
I never in my wildest dreams imagined it this way.
But sometimes I just don't know you, there's a stranger in our home.
When I'm lying right beside you is when I'm most alone.

And I think my heart is broken, there's an emptiness inside.
So many things I've longed for have so often been denied.
Still I wouldn't try to change you, there's no one that's to blame.
It's just some things that mean so much and we just don't feel the same.
Love is why I came here in the first place, love is now the reason I must go.
Love is all I ever hoped to find here, love is still the only dream I know.
True love is still the only dream I know.
