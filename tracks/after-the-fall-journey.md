So now love is gone
I can't t go on, love is gone
I want to say
Now it's just too late
Waited far too long


Should have told you then I knew
Should have told you right
From the staaart (hey)
But the words
Didn't come out right
So I'll tell you
Straight from my heart


You meant more to me
Than I let you see
You held on somehow
All your tenderness
And your sweet caress
I miss you now
But a headstrong stubborn man
Only works it out the best he caaan
Valentines he never sent
There's not enough time
He's a working maaan


Can't stop falling
Heartaches calling
Finds you after the fall
Saints or sinners
Take no prisoners
What's left after you fall
No not much no
Oh I say love is gone
I can't go on
Now love is gone
I want to say
But It's just too late
Waited far too long


Should have told you then I knew
Should have told you right
From the staaart
But the words
Didn't come out right
So I'll tell you
Straight from my heaaaart


Can't stop falling
Heartaches calling
Finds you after the fall
Saints or sinners
Take no prisoners
What's left after you fall
No not much no
Ohh no not much
Ohh no no no...
After you fall , after you fall...
