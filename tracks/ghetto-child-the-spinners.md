When I was seventeen
I ran away from home
And from everything
I had ever known

I was sick and tired
Living in a town
Filled with narrow minds
And hate

They used to laugh at me
The children called me names
I would ran and hide
Feelin' so ashamed

Just for being born
I was just a boy
Punished for a crime
That was not mine

Life ain't so easy
When you're a ghetto child
Oh baby, life ain't so easy
When you're a ghetto child
No one tried to understand
Papa did the best a man could do

A child reality
Is paid for by his folks
Fancy fairy tales
Are born and sold by those

Who can well afford
Time to make believe
Childhood dreams can still come true
Uh, huh- huh- huh

So I've been wandering
Traveling all around
Guess it ain't my style
To live in just one town

Still I'll never know
Why a child is blamed
Ridiculed and shamed
We're all the same

Life ain't so easy
When you're a ghetto child
I'm a witness that life ain't so easy
When you're a ghetto child, yeah

Oh oh yeah
Life ain't so easy
When you're a ghetto child child

Oh, baby
Life ain't so easy
Yeah, hey, hey
When you're a ghetto child
Life can be rough
Life ain't so easy
The going gets tough
When you're a ghetto child
Yeah, but remember

Oh baby, life ain't so easy
Things gotta change
When you're a ghetto child
Things gotta change, gotta change, yeah, yeah!
Life ain't so easy
When you're a ghetto child
Whoa, oh, oh, whoa,I'm a ghetto boy
