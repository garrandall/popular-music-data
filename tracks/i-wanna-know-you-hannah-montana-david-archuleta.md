Whoa oh
Whoa oh
Whoa oh


When I saw you over there
I didn't mean to stare
But my mind was everywhere
I wanna know you

Gonna guess that you're the kind
To say what's on your mind
But you listen when I have something to show you

There's a mark above your eye
You got it in July
Fighting for your sister's reputation
You remember people's names
And valentines are lame

So I bring you flowers just for no occasion, oh


Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
I wanna know you
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
I wanna go there where you go
I wanna find out what you know
And maybe someday down the road
Sit back and say to myself,
"Yeah, I thought so."


You smile, never shout
You stand out in a crowd
You make the best of every situation
Correct me if I'm wrong
You're fragile and you're strong
A beautiful and perfect combination


Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
I wanna know you
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
I wanna go there where you go
I wanna find out what you know
And maybe someday down the road
Sit back and say to myself.
I like how you are with me
In our future history
And maybe someday down the road
Sit back and say to myself,
"Yeah, I thought so."


Yeah I thought so, whoa, yeah


Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
I wanna know you
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
I wanna go there where you go
I wanna find out what you know
And maybe someday down the road
Sit back and say to myself.
I like how you are with me
In our future history
And maybe someday down the road
Sit back and say to myself,
"Yeah, I thought so."
