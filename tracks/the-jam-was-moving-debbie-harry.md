The order came directly from the CIA
To start the following investigation:
Find out what's the hidden power
Lying in the grooves
That drives 'em crazy all across the nation

They found the jam was moving
Go ahead now, go ahead now
It makes the people keep grooving
Go ahead now, go ahead now

The agent who was sanctioned to investigate
When he came home he found to his amazement
He saw his own children live on Colt 45
And they were rock hip-popping in the basement

They found the jam was moving
Go ahead now, go ahead now
That makes the people keep grooving
Go ahead now

They found the jam was moving
Go ahead now, go ahead now
It makes the people keep grooving
Go ahead now, go ahead now

When the order came from the CIA:
"You better look out, and find out
What's the hidden power lying in the grooves
They're going crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, all across the nation."

Agent said, "Found the jam was moving
Go ahead now, go ahead now
It makes the people keep grooving
Go ahead now, go ahead now."
