The order came directly from the CIA
To start the following investigation
Find out what's the hidden power lying in the grooves
That drives em crazy all across the nation
They found the jam was moving
Go ahead now, go ahead now
It makes the people keep grooving
Go ahead now, go ahead now

The agent, who assigned Jim to investigate
When he came home he found to his amazement
He saw his own children live on Colt 45
And they were rocking popping in the basement

They found the jam was moving
Go ahead now, go ahead now
It makes the people keep grooving
Go ahead now, go ahead now

They found the jam was moving
Go ahead now, go ahead now
It makes the people keep grooving
Go ahead now, go ahead now

When the order came from the CIA
You better look out, and find out what's the hidden power lying in the grooves
They're going crazy crazy crazy crazy all across the nation
Agent said, "Found the jam was moving
Go ahead now, go ahead now
It makes the people keep grooving
Go ahead now"

The jam was moving
The people keep grooving
