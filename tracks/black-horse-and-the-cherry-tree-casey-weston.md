Well my heart knows me better than I know myself
So I'm gonna let it do all the talking. (woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
I came across a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree. (woo-hoo, woo-hoo)

I fell in fear, upon my back
I said don't look back, just keep on walking. (woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
When the big black horse said "look this way"
Said "hey lady, will you marry me?" (woo-hoo, woo-hoo)

But I said no, no, no, no-no-no, I said no, no, you're not the one for me
No, no, no, no-no-no, I said no, no, you're not the one for me

And my heart had a problem, in the early hours
So it stopped it dead for a beat or two. (woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
But I cut some cord, and I shouldn't have done that
And it won't forgive me after all these years (woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
So I sent her to a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree. (woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
Now it won't come back, cause it's oh so happy
And now I've got a hole for the world to see (woo-hoo, woo-hoo)

And it said no, no, no, no-no-no, it said no, no, you're not the one for me
No, no, no, no-no-no, said no, no, you're not the one for me
Not the one for me

It said no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you're not the one for me
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you're not the one for me

Big black horse and a cherry tree
I can't quite get there cause my heart forsaken me, yeah yeah yeah
Big black horse and a cherry tree
I can't quite get there cause my heart forsaken me
