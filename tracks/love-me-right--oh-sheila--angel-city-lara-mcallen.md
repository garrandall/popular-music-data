Oh baby love me right
Let me love you till you get it right
Why can't you let the others be
Coz with you is where I got to be
Oh sugar...where've you been
Hangin' out with your male friends
Listen...somebodys gonna hurt you
The way you love to keep hurting me

Oh baby love me right
Let me love you till the morning comes
Oh sugar love me right
You know I want to be the only one

Let me love you till you get it right

Oh baby... understand
I want you to be the only man
But it seems so it's getting too hard
I think I start to have my own fun

Oh baby... It's plain to see
That I'm qualified to fill your needs
You think you put'n over on me
Oh honey baby just you wait and see

Oh baby love me right
Let me love you till the morning comes
Oh sugar love me right
You know I want to be the only one

Let me love you till you get it right

Love me right
You gotta love me
Love me right
You gotta love me

Let me love you till you get it right

Oh baby love me right
Let me love you till the morning comes
Oh sugar love me right
You know I want to be the only one
