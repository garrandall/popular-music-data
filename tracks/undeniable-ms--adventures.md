Words can't express
What I'm feeling every time I look at you
I must confess
Never thought I'd be fallin baby but it's true

Cause every time you hold me tight
My heart explodes
It never felt so right
I know this could be the night
Yes you're the one
My heart can't tell a lie

When we kiss it's undeniable
Can't resist this undeniable love
We can't miss its undeniable
Don't you know it baby
I just can't get enough

It's undeniable so reliable
Every time we touch
You get me off like a rocket
I can't stop can't stop can't stop

Words can't describe
What I'm feeling every time your call my name
I can't deny
Every time we touch baby I go insane
Cause every time you hold me tight
Baby don't you know
Chills go up and down my spine

I know this could be the night
Yes you're the one
My heart can't tell a lie

When we kiss it's undeniable
Can't resist this undeniable love
We can't miss its undeniable
Don't you know it baby
I just can't get enough

Hey hoooooo

Oh oh

It's undeniable so reliable
Every time we touch
You get me off like a rocket
I can't stop can't stop can't stop

Ms. Adventure you know you make me dizzy
Are not Arsenio but let's get busy
Together forever and may I dare say
That you look good from your toes to your hairspray
And now your l-o-v-e's got me
So won't you let your b-o-d-y rock me
Cause I'm ready willing and able to do anything that you ask me to
Cause you're the type of girl that keeps me smiling
And feeling like I'm on fantasy Island
You got touch that drives men crazy
So won't you step to the man Doug Lazy
And into the swing of a wild thing
Until we hear the fat lady start to sing
And then you know my love is reliable
I can't resist you girls your undeniable

When we kiss it's undeniable
Can't resist this undeniable love
We can't miss its undeniable
Don't you know it baby
I just can't get enough

You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me you turn me on
You turn me you turn me on
