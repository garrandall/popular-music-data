What's Going On 


Tell Me 


People Dying
People Crying
Lord help us 


Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying 


Oh, brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying


That's Right


You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today 


Oh my father, father
We don't need to escalate


You see war is not the answer


For only love can conquer hate 


You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today


Barricades, can't block our way 


Don't punish me with brutality


Talk to me
So you can see 



Oh what's going on
What's going on
Yeah what's going on
Ahh what's going on 


What's going on in a world filled with pain
Where's the love for which we pray
What's going on
When our children can't play
Homeless can't eat
There's got to be a better way
What's going on
When we politically blind
Can't see the signs of endangered times
What's going on 


Ah tell me
What's going on in the world today
I'd rather be dead
Than turn my head away
We gotta first world vision to complete, to lift our
Hands in the air and cry for a switch 


Father, father


Father help us, come on 


Everybody thinks we're wrong 


Oh, but who are they to judge us
Together we can all be strong


United we stand, Divided we fall


Oh you know we've got to find a way


To bring some understanding here today


Barricades can't block our way


Don't punish me with brutality 


Baby talk to me
So you can see 

Yeah, what's going on
Hey, what's going on
Somebody tell me what's going on
I'll tell you what's goin' on-uh 


What's going on 'cross seas
Every minute a child dies by this disease
In record numbers indeed
Got momma's crying out please
My baby hold on
My child ain't done nothing wrong
Still I want to holler
Ask them why they don't bother
Oh no, oh no
Make me turn to my father
And ask him why they all got a trapped soul


I can feel what was bothering Marvin
Why his words forever remain 
Dealing with these modern day problems
'Cause of ignorance surrounding me and my constituents
Too many infected
Too many lives diminishing 
Nobody say Protestants, Jews, Blacks, and Whites, Latinos and Asians
Pray together
Less fight 
We better unite
As genocide chemical war 
And the rich and the poor
Know that God delivers a cure 


It's a shame our reality is devastating
People praying for a cure
Dying while they're waiting
Ask the Lord for the comfort and strength to face it
All the kids with dreams 
Won't get the chance to chase it
Makes me sad
Think about the lives they would've had
Think about the orphan babies got no moms and dads
How can we sit back and not try to make it right
We gotta come together
We gotta fight for life 


Somebody tell me what's going on 
(what's going on)
We got human beings using humans for a bomb
But everyone wanna live
Don't nobody really want to die
You feeling me right
I can't be watching people die
(die)
And watching people cry
Let me break it down for a minute
If there's enough room here for you and me
There's plenty of room for some humanity 

Somebody tell me what's going on
(what's going on)
Somebody tell me what's going on
(what's going on)
Somebody tell me what's going on
(what's going on)
Somebody tell me what's going on
(what's going on)
Somebody tell me what's going on
(what's going on)
Somebody tell me what's going on
(what's going on)
Somebody tell me what's going on
(what's going on)
Somebody tell me what's going on
(what's going on)
