See baby you're my little secret,
If you don't tell, I won't tell,
And that's how we gotta keep it.



Did anybody see you coming to my house last night?
When I got your message on my beeper,
That you wanna do everything I like,
Alright, alright.


I like being in the same room as you and your girlfriend.
The fact that she don't know,
That really turns me on.
She'll never guess in a million years,
That we've got this thing going on.


You're my little secret,
And that's how we should keep it.
It's on everybody's mind, about you and I,
They think so, but they don't really know.
Or wanna know that,
You're my little secret,
And that's how we should keep it.
We should never let 'em know,
Never let it show.
If you know, like I know,
We should never let it go.


If anybody knew that it was you and your house,
That I was creepin' to all the time,
I'd probably still do it,
'Cause I find it hard to keep you off of my mind.




Everybody cheats,
But you gotta know how, you gotta know when,
You gotta know why my infatuation with you,
Is taking me on an emotional high.
I'm caught all up in this love affair baby,
Speculation will bring us stares.
All my friends are asking me about it,
Still the truth I can't reveal.



As long as I'm right here,
You ain't never gonna be by yourself.
'Cause the love that we share,
It stays on my mind,
You're always gonna be a little secret of mine.
