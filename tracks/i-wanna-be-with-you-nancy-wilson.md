I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
After all the nights
Of wanting you
Lying there, loving you, hating you
Tonight I'm touching you, holding you
World, you're gonna see
We'll make it somehow
Here's my man and me
You can't hurt us now

We're gonna have it all
I'll love you every day
Honey life could be
So great for us
Here's our chance
It's not too late for us
Grab it fast for life
Won't' wait for us

I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
