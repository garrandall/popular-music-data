Musical thing called the rainy days
Specially designed not to make you go astray, you know

Rainy days, rainy rainy rainy out there
Song dong dong dong dong dong dong dong
Rainy days, rainy rainy rainy out deh
Song dong dong dong dong dong dong dong

Drink one beer den me sit down 'pon de sofa
Look outside it was raining all over
Go in the other rom and den me put on the fire
Through me did cold and me body a shiver
Likkle after dat I said I started to wonder
Three hours gone and de rain jus' a thunder
All de time me jus look pon de dark sky
Hurry up and bring back de sun fe I!

Rainy days, rainy rainy rainy out there
Song dong dong dong dong dong dong dong
Rainy days, rainy rainy rainy out deh
Song dong dong dong dong dong dong dong

When me back a yard is gone like me gone under water
Take a deep breath but me head jus' go under
Everything gone out of order
Coming onto me like a lamb to the slaughter
All arund me hear the scientists a caution
Warning people 'bout the world situation
People people seh you've got to be wize
When will we realize?

Rainy days, rainy rainy rainy out there
Song dong dong dong dong dong dong dong
Rainy days, rainy rainy rainy out deh
Song dong dong dong dong dong dong dong

'Cause me seh
Everybody happy now we abolish apartheid
1963 only come like last night
People people seh you've got to remember
Don;t you forget about Nelson Mandela
Many years ago, yes, they called him a liar
Finding it hard to put him under water
South Africa is full of sharks
It's a shame that we didn't have a Noah's Ark

Rainy days, rainy rainy rainy out there
Song dong dong dong dong dong dong dong
Rainy days, rainy rainy rainy out deh
Song dong dong dong dong dong dong dong

Chi oh oh
Chi oh oh
Chi oh oh
Watch the ride

Rainy days, rainy rainy rainy out there
Song dong dong dong dong dong dong dong
Rainy days, rainy rainy rainy out deh
Song dong dong dong dong dong dong dong
