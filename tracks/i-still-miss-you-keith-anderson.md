I've changed the presets to my truck,
So those old songs don't sneak up.
But they still find me
And remind me
Yeah you come back that easy.
I've tries restaurants I've never been to
Ordered new things off the menu
That i never tried
'Cause you didn't like,
but two drinks in and you're by my side


I've talked to friends
Talked to myself
Talked to god
I prayed like hell
But i still miss you
I tried sober I tried drinkin'
I've been strong and I've been weak
But I still miss you.
I've done everything move on like I'm supposed to
I'd give anything for one more minute with you
I still miss you
I still miss you baby

I never knew til you were gone
How many pages you were on
It never ends I keep turning
And line after line and you are there again
I don't know how to let you go
You are so deep down in my soul
I feel helpless so hopeless
Its a door that never closes
No I don't know how to do this



I've talked to friends
I've talked to myself
I've talked to God
I prayed liked hell but I still miss you
I tried sober I tried drinking
I've been strong and I've been weak
And I still miss you
I've done everything
Move on like I'm supposed to
I'd give anything for one more minute with you
I still miss you yeah

I still miss you
I still miss you...... yeah.... yeah.....
