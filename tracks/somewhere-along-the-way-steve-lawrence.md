I used to walk with you along the avenue,
Our hearts were carefree and gay.
How could I know I'd lose you
Somewhere along the way?

The friends we used to know would always smile hello,
No love like our love they'd say.
Then love slipped through our fingers
Somewhere along the way.

I should forget but with the loneliness of night I start remembering
Everything you're gonna get.
There's still a feeling deep inside that you will always be part of me.
So now I look for you along the avenue,
And as I wander I pray
That someday soon I'll find you
Somewhere along the way.

I lost my love somewhere along the way.
