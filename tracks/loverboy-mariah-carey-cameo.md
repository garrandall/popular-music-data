(Ah) My girl 
Got a new boyfriend 
Yeah 
Yeah (Oh) 
K-I-S-S-I-N-G 

(Ah) Uh huh uh huh baby 
(Ah) Uh huh uh huh baby 
(Ah) Uh huh uh huh baby 
(Whooooooooooooooo) 
I wanna 
I wanna 
I wanna 
I wanna 
I need a 
I need a 
I need a 
I need a 
A lover 
A lover 
A lover 
A lover 
A lover 
A lover 
A lover 
A loverboy for me 


I got myself a lover 
Who loves what I like 
When he invites me over 
I come every time 
Oh my sugar daddy 
Takes me for a ride 
Whatever way we're going 
It's delirium time

He's all mine 
And his loving makes me high 
Like a taste of ecstasy 
All I need is him to be my loverboy 

Loverboy 
Come on and love me 
Give me more 
Touch me and touch me 
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long 
(Baby all night long) 
Loverboy come on and take me 
Only you know how to make me 
Shudder with anticipation 
All night long 
(All night long) 

I got myself a lover 
And he's so sublime 
It's quite a bit of heaven 
To feel in him inside 
So come on sugar daddy 
Take me for a ride 
Whatever way we're going next 
It's delirium time

I get weak 
And his candy's just so sweet 
When he caressed my whole body 
All I need is him to be my loverboy 

Loverboy 
Come on and love me 
Give me more 
Touch me and touch me 
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long 
(I enjoy the way you rock me) 
Loverboy come on and take me 
Only you know how to make me 
Shudder with anticipation 
All night long 


This stuff is starting now 
This stuff is starting now 
It's the same feeling 
I always seem to get around you (Yes I do) 
Cause you affect me 
Fascinate me 
I thank heaven for the things that you do 
This stuff is starting now 
This stuff is starting now 
This stuff is starting now (Whoo) 

My thoughts flow in my head 
I toss and turn in my bed 
In the morning when I think about you (Candy) 
Simply put, you're the reason why 
Even though I'm real shy 
It's like candy 
I attempt to look my best for you (Indeed I do) 


Loverboy 
Loverboy 
Come on and love me 
Give me more 
Touch me and touch me 
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long 
(I enjoy the way you rock me) 
Loverboy come on and take me 
Only you know how to make me 
Shudder with anticipation 
All night long (Strawberry) 
Loverboy come on and take me (Raspberry) 
Only you know how to make me (All those good things) 
Shudder with anticipation (Diamonds and gumdrops) 
All night long (That's what you seem to me) 
Oh loverboy 
Loverboy 
Come on and love me 
Give me more 
Touch me and touch me 
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long 
Loverboy come on and take me 
Only you know how to make me 
Shudder with anticipation 
All night long
