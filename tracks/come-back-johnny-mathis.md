Come to me now that I have found you
Come to me, wrap my love around you
Look in my eyes, hear what they say
Don't run away
Stay, stay, stay

I'm on fire, let your lips caress me
My desire is that you possess me
Don't be afraid for love to come to you
My lover, come to me
Lover, come to me
Come to me

Don't be afraid for love to come to you
My lover, come to me
Lover, come to me
Come to me
