Little Sister by the record machine
A tiny dancer such a sweet sixteen
She's goin' out she's gonna party tonight
She's gonna shake and make it last all night

Little brother's got a drivin' machine
A fast driver such a clean machine
They're going out they're gonna put out the lights
They gonna rock it rock it rock it

You can still rock in America
Ah yeah s'alright
You can still rock in America
Ah yeah all night
You can still rock in America

Little sister makes a move for the door
The door squeaks she's on the second floor
Her daddy wakes "Is everything OK?"
Not a sound as she makes her getaway

Little brother's got it ready to roll
Tires burning as they head for the show
Light it up and turn the music up loud
And Rock it rock it rock it

You can still rock in America
Ah yeah s'alright
You can still rock in America
Ah yeah all night
You can still rock in America

Rock in America (you can still)
Rock in America (rock in America)
Rock in America (Yeah you can still)
Rock in America

You can still rock in America
Ah yeah s'alright
You can still rock in America
Ah yeah all night
You can still rock in America
You can still rock in America
Well you can still rock in America
