When I noticed her the first time 
I was outside running barefoot in the rain 
She lived in the house next door 
Her nose was pressed against the window pane 
When I looked at her she smiled 
And showed a place where two teeth used to be 
And I heard her ask her mom if she 
Could come outside and play with me 
Soon the day's of sand and shovels 
Gave way to the mysteries of life 
Then I noticed she was changing and I 
Looked at her through different eyes 
We became as one and knew a love 
Without beginning or an end 
And everyday I lived with her 
Was like a new day dawning once again 

And I've loved her since every doll was Shirley Temple 
Soda pop was still a nickel 
Jam was on her fingertips 
Milk was circled on her lips 
After many years our live grew 
Silent and at night I heard her cry 
And when she left me in the fall I knew 
That it would be our last goodbye 
I was man enough to give her 
Everything she needed for a while 
And searching for a perfect love 
I found that I could not give her a child 
Now she lives a quiet life 
And is the mother of a little girl 
Every time I pass her house 
My thoughts go back into another world 
Because I see her little girl 
Her nose is pressed against the window pane 
She thinks I'm a lonely man 
Who wants to come inside out of the rain 
And I've loved her since every doll was shirley Temple 
Soda pop was still a nickel 
Jam was on her fingertips 
Milk was circled on her lips
