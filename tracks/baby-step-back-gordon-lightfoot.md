Now it looks to me like the same old place,
in the sky it looks like rain.
The same old town with the same old streets,
my address has not changed.
You can find me there with the door shut tight, 
and the one wish that remains.

Baby step back, baby step back, 
either step up or step back.

Now you know I don't write no bad checks,
I have no wish to repent.
I've seen a few but whatever I do,
I don't cause no accidents.
Whiskey and wine help me pass the time,
I don't leave no evidence.

Baby step back, baby step back,
either step up or step back.
Baby step back, baby step back,
either step up or step back.

Still I don't kneel down I was born to fight,
so you best leave me alone.
Maybe I'll get much more than I need,
or much less than I should own,
last of all let me say it again,
either step up or step on.

Baby step back, baby step back,
either step up or step back.
Baby walk back, baby walk back,
either walk on or walk back.

Baby step back, baby step back,
either step up or step back.
Baby walk back, baby walk back,
either walk on or walk back.
Baby step back, baby step back,
either step up or step back.
