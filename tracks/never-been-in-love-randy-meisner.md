I know you must be somebody else's dream
Please don't go, 'cause it really doesn't matter to me

When I look in your eyes, sweet child
And listen to your heart beating wild
I can't stop burning for you
I can't stop burning for you

And you make me feel like I've never been in love before
Don't keep me waiting, I'm already falling
I feel like I've never been in love
And I don't know what to do

You must be wondering what I mean
Please don't go, let me show you just how good it can be

Look in my eyes, sweet child
Listen to my heart beating wild
I can't stop burning for you
I can't stop burning for you

And you make me feel like I've never been in love before
I feel like I've never been in love

I know you must be somebody else's dream
Please don't go, let me show you just how good it can be

When I look in your eyes, sweet child
And listen to your heart beating wild
I can't stop burning for you
Oh, I can't stop burning for you

And you make me feel like I've never been in love before
Don't keep me waiting, I'm already falling
I feel like I've never been in love

Oh, I feel like I've never been in love before
It feels like I've never been in love
I feel like I've never been in love before
It feels like I've never been in love
