Day without sun, stars without night
Moon without glow, what a lonely sight

CHORUS:
Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think I'd see
Me without you (me without you)
Or you without me (you without me), yeah

Birds without song, trees without ground
Man without words, words without a sound


We vowed to always be as one till the end of time
But now that you've left me, it doesn't seem real somehow

Summer without children running wild, winter without pain, yeah
Summer without heat & a caribou without a game


You without me (me without you)
Lonely lonely sight (you without me)
Can't you see me cryin', baby? (Me without you)
There's no one mind (you without me)
I'm blue every night
