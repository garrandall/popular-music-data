Just somethin' 'bout you...
Way I'm lookin' at you, whatever
You keep lookin' at me
You gettin' scared now, right?
Don't feel me baby, it's just Justin
It feel good, right?
Listen


I kinda noticed, something wasn't right
From your colorful face
It's kind of weird to me
Since you're so fine
If it's up to me, your face will change


If you smile then that should set the tone
Just be limber
And if you let go, the music should move your bones
Just remember
Sing a song to me


Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (Hey!)
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you


See, people are so phony
Nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so was dating
Love you or they're hatin'
When it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause we're here tonight


If you smile, then that should set the tone
Just be limber, baby
And if you let go, the music should move your bones
Baby, just remember
Sing a song to me


Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (Hey!)
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you


Yeah, you know I can make ya happy
I could change your life
If you give me that chance to be your man
(I won't let you down, baby)
If you give me that chance to be your man
(Here baby, put on my jacket)
And then..


Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you, baby)
Girl (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you, baby)
Girl


Ma, whatchu wanna do?
I'm in front of you
Grab a friend see, I can have fun with two
Or me and you put on a stage show
In the mall kids ask "How the chain glow?"
Point to her they say, "Wow, it's the same glow"
Point to me I say, "Yeah, it's the same dough"
We the same type, you my a-like
You have me sleepin' in the same bed every night
Go ride wit me you deservin' the best
Take a few shots, let it burn in your chest
We could ride down, pumpin' N.E.R.D. in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
Play number three, joint called "Brain" (I just love your... brain)
Ma, took a hint, make me swerve in the lane
The name Malicious and I burn every track
Clipse and J. Timberlake - now how heavy is that?


Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you, baby)
Girl (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you, baby)
Girl
Oh


Ain't nobody love you like I love you (Can't love you like I do)
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya like I do (Hey!)
Late at night, I talk to you (Hey)
You will know the difference when I


Break it down
You know, I used to dream about this when I was a little boy
I never thought it would end up this way, drums (hey!)
It's kind of special right? Yeah
You know, you think about it
Sometimes people, just destined
Destined to do what they do
And that's what it is
Now everybody dance...
