We never spoke a word
But every thought she had, I heard
From across the room
We were standing face to face
I couldn't find the words to say
Give me one more move
I don't even know her name
I guess foolish pride's to blame


Now I'm falling in love as she's walking away
And my heart won't tell my mind
To tell my mouth what it should say
I may have lost this battle
Live to fight another day
Now I'm falling in love as she's walking away


Wise man next to me did say
About the one that got away
Son, I missed my chance
Don't you let regret take place
Of the dreams you have to chase
Ask her to dance
(Go on son)


You might fall down on your face
Roll the dice and have some faith


Don't be falling in love as she's walking away
When your heart won't tell your mind
To tell your mouth what it should say
You may have lost this battle
Live to fight another day
Don't be falling in love as she's walking away


You might fall down on your face
Roll the dice and have some faith


Don't be falling in love as she's walking away
When your heart won't tell your mind
To tell your mouth what it should say
You may have lost this battle
Live to fight another day
Don't be falling in love as she's walking away
