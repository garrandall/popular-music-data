Oh … you know, you know, you know, you know …

You must a been a beautiful baby
You must a been a beautiful child
When you were only startin'
To go to kindergarten
I bet you drove those other childs wild!

Oh yeah … oh yeah … oh yeah …
An' when it came to winnin' blue ribbons
Well ... I bet you taught the other kids how
Well, I can see the judge's eyes
As they handed you the prize
I bet you took the cutest bow!

Yeah! You must a been a beautiful baby
'cause baby won't you look at you now

Oh yeah ... oh yeah ... oh yeah

You must a have been a beautiful baby
You must a have been a beautiful child
When you were only startin'

To go to kindergarten
I know you drove the other childs wild
An' I wasn't even there

An' when you came to winnin' blue ribbons
Hey … I know you taught those other kids how
Well, I can see the judge's eyes
As they handed you the prize
I know you made the cutest bow!

Yeah! You must a been a beautiful baby
‘cause baby won't you look at you now
Oh, I mean … I mean … oh, beautiful …
Oh, beautiful
Oh, beautiful

Oh, beautiful
Oh, beautiful
Oh, beautiful

Ah, I know you're beautiful … too beautiful for words
