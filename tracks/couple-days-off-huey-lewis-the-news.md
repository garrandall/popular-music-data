I like my job and I don't mind the work
But eleven out of twelve is bound to hurt
The pay's pretty good and the benefits are fine
But I got a little girl and I wanna make her mine

Don't mind telling you I get a little mad
To get a bit ahead takes all the time I have
Don't misunderstand me
I'm not getting soft
All I want is a couple days off

Can't wait for the weekend
Ah baby just can't wait no

I don't need another high song to sing
I don't need a shiny new diamond ring
I don't need to meet nobody else
I just need a little time for myself
'cause I'm only human, I'm no machine
I need a little loving only you know what I mean
Don't misunderstand me
I'm not getting soft
All I want is a couple days off

Let me catch my breath

Thank god for the weekend

Back to the old grind

I don't need another long coffee break
I've had as much coffee as a man can take
I need to change my disposition
Change my point of view
I need time to figure out what I want to do

Believe me when I tell you it gets a little rough
We work a little harder but it never is enough

I'm not afraid to say
I'm a total loss
All I want is a couple days off

Can't wait for the weekend
