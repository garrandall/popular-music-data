There's a kind of hush
All over the world tonight
All over the world
You can hear the sound of lovers in love
You know what I mean
Just the two of us and nobody else in sight
There's nobody else
And I'm feeling good just holding you tight
So listen very carefully
Move closer now
And you will see what I mean
It isn't a dream
The only sound that you will hear
Is when I whisper in your ear
I love you forever and ever
There's a kind of hush
All over the world tonight
All over the world
You can hear the sound of lovers in love
La la la
La la la
La la la
So listen very carefully
Move closer now
And you will see what I mean
It isn't a dream
The only sound that you will hear
Is when I whisper in your ear
I love you forever and ever
There's a kind of hush
All over the world tonight
All over the world
People just like us are fallin' in love
Yeah, they're fallin' in love
Hush, they're fallin' in love
Hush
