Forever lovers, forever friends
A lifetime's a short time
When love never ends

They checked into a small hotel
She blushed when he asked
For the bridal suite

Was the beginning of their lives together
Anxiously they'd waited for the moment
That their love would be complete

She reached inside
Her brand new traveling bag
And found her brand new negligee
And then she shyly slipped it on

And suddenly, he realized
The beauty of the tender prize
He'd waited for so long and finally won

She climbed into the bed
He snapped his fingers
Said, I've got to get champagne

There's a little store right down the block
I'll only be a minute, close your eyes
And, hon, I'll be right back again

And time goes by so slowly
She's not sure how much has passed
When she hears the siren
Screaming through the night

And seven hours later, they find her
Rocking on the bed
Just singing in the early morning light

Forever lovers, forever friends
A lifetime's a short time
When love never ends

She checks into the old hotel
And pays a little extra for the suite

She slips into the faded negligee
And brushes down her hair of gray
And lays her body down to wait

And the night air through the curtains
Makes a sound like someone breathing
And she reaches for him with her fingertips

And they find her in the morning
With tear stains on her pillow
And a smile like a kiss upon her lips

Forever lovers, forever friends
A lifetime's a short time
I knew I'd see you again

Forever lovers, forever friends
A lifetime's a short time
When love never ends
