Waiting at the station
Tears filling up my eyes
Sometimes the pain you hide
Burns like a fire inside
Look out my window
Sometimes it's hard to see
The things you want in life
Come and go so easily


She took the last train
Out of my heart
She took the last train
And now I think I'll make
A brand new start
She took the last train
Out of my heart

Watching the days go by
Thinking 'bout the plans we made
Days  turn into years
Funny how they fade away
Sometimes I think of those days
Sometimes I just hide away
Waiting on that 9:20 train
Waiting on a memory



My lady's on the fly
And she's never coming back
My love is like a steam train
Rolling down  the tracks yea, yeaa
