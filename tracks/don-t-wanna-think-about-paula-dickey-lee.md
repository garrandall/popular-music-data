I thought that when we parted
I'd broken all the ties that bind
But it's been a long time since I've seen Paula
And I can't get her out of my mind

Wanna tell you now
I've got to lose my sorrow
I've got to think of tomorrow
'Cause I don't want to think about Paula anymore

We used to have some happy times
And that's what I can't forget
'Cause I keep seeing her smiling face
And I stay all upset

Can't you hear me now
I've got to lose my sorrow
Build a new dream for tomorrow
'Cause I don't want to think about Paula anymore
(Think about her any more)

I keep trying to make a start
I've got to mend this broken heart
But every time I make a gain
Someone has to speek her name

I don't care if the sun don't shine
Makes no difference to me
'Cause there ain't a thing that the weather can do
To end my misery

Can't you hear me now
I've got to lose my sorrow
I've got to think of tomorrow
'Cause I don't want to think about Paula anymore

Everybody now
I've got to lose my sorrow
I've got to think of tomorrow
'Cause I don't want to think about Paula anymore
