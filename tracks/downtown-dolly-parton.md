When you're alone and life is making you lonely
You can always go downtown
When you got worries, all the noise and the hurry
Seems to help, I know, downtown

Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city
Linger on the sidewalks where the neon signs are pretty
How can you lose?
The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares

And go downtown
Things'll be great when you're downtown
No finer place for sure, downtown
Everything's waiting for you

Don't hang around and let your problems surround you
There are movie shows, downtown
Or maybe you know some little places to go to
Where they never close, downtown

Just listen to the rhythm of the music that they're playin'
Making conversation while you're on the dance floor swayin'
Happy again
The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares

And go downtown
Where all the lights are bright, downtown
Waiting for you tonight, downtown
You're gonna be alright now

And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to guide them along
So maybe I'll see you there
You can forget all your troubles
Just forget all your cares

And go downtown
Things'll be great when you're downtown
Don't wait a minute more, downtown
Everything's waiting for you

Downtown, where all the lights are bright
Downtown, waiting for you tonight
Downtown, you're going to be alright now
Get on, get on, get on downtown

Downtown, where all the lights are bright
Downtown, waiting for you tonight
Downtown, you're going to be alright now
Get on, get on, get on downtown
