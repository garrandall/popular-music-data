Please, let me sit down beside you.
I've got something to tell you, you should know.
I just couldn't wait for not another day.
I love you, for more than words can ever say.

Honey living without you is so painful.
I was tempted to call it a day.
You've got me in your hand, why can't you understand.
I love you baby, for more than words can say.

I just can't sleep, when I lay down in my bed.
The thougths of you babe, just linger in my head.
Living without you is so painful. I was tempted to call it a day.
You've got me in your hand, why can't you understand.
I love you honey, for more than words can say.
I love you honey, for more than words can say.
Yes, I do.
