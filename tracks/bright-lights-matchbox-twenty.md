She got out of town
On a railway, New York bound
Took all except my name
Another alien out on Broadway


There's some things in this world
You just can't change
Some things you can't see
Until it gets too late


And baby, baby, baby
When all your love is gone, who will save me
From all I'm up against out in this world?
And maybe, maybe, maybe
You'll find somethin' that's enough to keep you
But if the bright lights don't receive you
You should turn yourself around and come on home


I got a hole in me now
Yeah, I got a scar I can talk about
She keeps a picture of me
In her apartment in the city


Some things in this world
Man, they don't make sense
Some things you don't need
Until they leave you
And they're things that you miss, you say


Baby, baby, baby
When all your love is gone
Who will save me
From all I'm up against out in this world?
And maybe, maybe, maybe
You'll find somethin' that's enough to keep you
But if the bright lights don't receive you
You should turn yourself around and come on home


Let that city take you in (come on home)
Let that city spit you out (come on home)
Let that city take you down
For God's sake, turn around


Baby, baby, baby
When all your love is gone
Who will save me
From all I'm up against out in this world?
Yeah, well, maybe, maybe, maybe
You'll find somethin' that's enough to keep you
But if the bright lights don't receive you
Turn yourself around and come on home


Yeah, come on home
Maybe, maybe, baby, baby
Come on home
Yeah, come on home
Come on home
Come on home
