Doo-doo, ba doo-doo-dood oo
Doo-doo, ba doo-doo-dood oo
Doo-doo, ba doo-doo-dood oo
Doo-doo, ba doo-doo-dood oo

Oh, brand new boots I bought ya
Fine, fine, blew your mind
Fin'ly thought I caught ya
And you love was mine all mine

I see you walk by with other guys
Step, step, steppin' on my toes
The whole world's talkin' 'bout
How I'm your Standby Santa Claus

But oh, your kisses thrill me
Sure love your angel eyes
The devil in you kills me
But I made up my mind

I'm gonna be your Sugar Daddy
Give you honey all my money
Well, L A to Cincinatti
That's how far I'd crawl for you
Oh baby I'll be your Sugar Daddy
Give you kissin' when its missin', yeah Oh
Baby, I'll try to keep you happy
'Cause I got a sweet tooth for your love

S-U-G, listen to me, listen to me
A-R, what it is, what it is
D-A-D-D-Y spells I'm your good thing

King of fools they crowned me
And the crown just fits me to a "T"
'Cause you only come around me
Just to pick up what you need
You just play on my emotions
With please, please, pretty please
Well everybody's got the notion
I'm your Goodwill Industry (Oh Henry)

He's driving me nuts,
while I'm giving you the candy, he's gettin' all
You love (Mary Jane said, Mary Jane said
I'm just your lollipop, sucker)
Well, my flavour's longlasting girl
It ain't never gonna stop
Nooooooooo
Baby, I'm a fool
Just a fool in love with you
(I can't help myself, oh, no)
Oh, no, I can't help myself

I'm gonna be your Sugar Daddy
Give you honey all my money
Well L A to Cincinatti
That's how far I'd crawl for you
Oh, baby, I'll be your Sugar Daddy
Give you kissin' when its missin'
I'll even let you drive my caddy, when I get one
Now listen, oh, oh, oh
I'm gonna be your Sugar Daddy
Give you honey, all my money
