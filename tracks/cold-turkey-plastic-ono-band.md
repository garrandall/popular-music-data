Temperature's rising
Fever is high
Can't see no future
Can't see the sky

My feet are so heavy
So is my head
I wish I was a baby
I wish I was dead

Cold turkey has got me on the run

My eyes are wide open
Can't get to sleep
One thing I'm sure of
I'm in at the deep freeze
Oh I'll be a good boy
Please make me well
I promise you anything
Get me out of this hell

Cold turkey has got me on the run

Cold turkey has got me on the run
