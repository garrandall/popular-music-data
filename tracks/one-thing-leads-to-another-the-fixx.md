The deception with tact
Just what are you trying to say
You've got a blank face which irritates
Communicate, pull out your party piece

You see dimensions in two
State your case with black or white
But when one little cross
Leads to shots, grit your teeth
You run for cover so discreet

Why don't they do what they say
Say what you mean
One thing leads to another
You told me something wrong
I know I listen too long
But then one thing leads to another

Then it's easy to believe
Somebody's been lying to me
But when the wrong word goes in the right ear
I know you've been lying to me

Why don't they do what they say
Say what they mean
One thing leads to another
You told me something wrong
I listen too long
But one thing leads to another

Why don't they do what they say
Say what you mean
One thing leads to another
One thing leads to another

Do what they say
Say what you mean
One thing leads to another
