The deception with tact
Just what are you trying to say?
You got a blank face, which irritates
Communicate, pull out your party piece
You see dimensions in two
State your case with black or white
But when one little cross
Leads to shots, grit your teeth
You run for cover so discreet
Why don't they


Do what they say
Say what you mean
Oh baby, one thing leads to another
You told me something wrong
I know I listen too long
But then one thing leads to another


The impression that you sell
Passes in and out like a scent
But the long face that you see
Comes from living close to your fears
If this is up, then I'm up
But you're running out of sight
You've seen your name on the walls
And when one little bump
Leads to shock miss a beat
You run for cover and there's heat
Why don't they


Do what they say
Say what you mean
One thing leads to another
You told me something wrong
I know I listen too long
But then one thing leads to another
Yeah, yeah, yeah


One thing (one, one thing) leads to another


Then it's easy to believe
Somebody's been lying to me
But when the wrong word
Goes in the right ear
I know you've been lying to me
It's getting rough, off the cuff
I've got to say enough's enough
Bigger the harder, he falls
But when the wrong antidote
Is like a bulge on the throat
You run for cover in the heat
Why don't they


Do what they say
Say what you mean
One thing leads to another
You told me something wrong
I know I listen too long
But then one thing leads to another
Yeah, yeah


One thing (one, one thing) leads to another
(one, another, thing, one thing)
One thing (one, one thing) leads to another
(one, another, thing, one thing)
One thing (one, one thing) leads to another
One thing leads to another
One thing (one, one thing) leads to another
(one, another, thing, one thing)
One thing (one, one thing) leads to another
(one, another, thing, one thing)
One thing (one, one thing) leads to another
One thing (one, one thing) leads to another
