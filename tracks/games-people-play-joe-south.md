Oh the games people now every night and every day now
Never meanin' what they say now and never sayin' what they mean
While they wile away the hours in their ivory towers
Until they're covered up with flowers in the back of a black limousine
Lotten da da da da lotten da da a dee da dee
Yes we're talkin' 'bout you and me and the games people play

Make one another cry break a heart then we say goodbye
Cross our hearts and we hope to die that the other one's to blame
But neither one will ever give in so we gaze at an eight by ten
Thinkin' 'bout the things that might have been and it's a dirty rotten shame
Lotten da da da da...

Your friends're walkin' up to ya singing glory hallelujah
As they're tryin' to sock it to ya in the name of the Lord
They're gonna teach you how to meditate read your horoscope and cheat your fate
And furthermore to hell with hate come on and get on board
Lotten da da da da...

Look around and tell me what you see what's happened to you and me
God grand me the serenity to just remember who I am
'Cause we've given up our sanity for our kind and our vanity
Turn our back on humanity and we don't give a lot
Lotten da da da da...
Yes we're talkin' 'bout you and me and the games people play
