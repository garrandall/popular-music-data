The love bug done bit me
Didn't mean for him to get me
Woo, get up in the morning
And I'm filled with desire
No, no, I can't stop the fire
Love is a real life wire
Ooh, it's a burning sensation
Far behind imagination

Love is like an itching in my heart
Tearing it all apart
Just an itching in my heart
And baby, I can't scratch it
Keeps me sighing, ooh
Keeps me yearning

No, mama can't help me
No, daddy can't help me
I've been bitten by the love bug
And I need some information
To help me out this situation

Now, when you're ill
You take a pill
When your thirsty
Drink your fill
What you gonna do
When love gets a hold
A hold on you
Love is like an itching in my heart
And baby, I can't scratch it

Love is a nagging irritation
Causing my heart complication
Love is a growing infection
And I don't know the correction
Got me rockin' and areelin'
And I can't shake the feelin'

Love is like an itching in my heart
Tearing it all apart
Just an itching in my heart
And baby, I can't scratch it
Keeps me sighing, ooh
Keeps me yearning

Keeps me burning
Keeps me tossing
Keeps me turning
Keeps me yearning

I've been bitten by the love bug
And I need some information
To help me out this situation
Love is a nagging irritation
Causing my heart complication

I've been bitten by the love bug...
