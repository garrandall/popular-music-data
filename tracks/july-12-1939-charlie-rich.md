July the 12th sure was a scorcher
Mama, she fixed some lemonade
Sister Beth was sunning in the sunshine
And baby Corey was playing in the shade

I looked up the road
And yonder comes a big car
Something we don't see much around here
Big man said, son, where's your pappy
Said, he's over in the cornfield
Not far from here

They started talking over by the rail fence
It looked like Papa was getting mad
They walked to the house and papa was crying
Papa never cried and I knew it was bad

Two weeks later in the Logan courthouse
Raining cats and dogs outside
Sure was awful the way mama was crying
She says she thought that woman had lied

Papa said, Judge
We tried to raise up a good boy
From a little bitty tot
Jody'd never go against
Of what a woman wishes
That kinda boy we know that he's not

You know the power of the almighty dollar
Will come out the winner every time
That Willie Buchanan done got away with something
They're trying to blame on the boy of mine

Hmmm mmm mmm... 

July the 12th, 1939

Hmmm mmm mmm...
