Go away little girl
Go away little girl
I'm not supposed to be alone with you

I know that your lips are sweet
But our lips must never meet
I'm belong to someone else
And I must be true

Oh, go away little girl
Go away little girl
It's hurting me more
Each minute
That you delay

When you are near me like this
You're much too hard to resist
So go away little girl
Before I beg you to stay

(Go away... please don't stay)

Ah, it'll never work out
When you're near me like this
You're much too hard to resist
So go away little girl
Let's call it a day little girl
Ah, go away little girl
Before I beg you to stay
