Let's call it a day, girl
Let's say we couldn't make it
You don't know the way, girl
You just know how to take it
I didn't give you my heart
Just to break it

We have so very much in common
You were too good to be true to me
And I can't be your fool, you see

So let's call it a day, girl
One kiss and it's goodbye now
Wish there was a way, girl
(To walk out) and never see you crying
Though I'm blue at that
I feel like dying

I can't be your fool, you see

So let's call it a day, girl
I'm gonna miss you plenty
What more can I say, girl
The odds are one to twenty
From this moment on
Will life will be empty

Let's call it a day, girl
Let's call it a day, girl
Let's call it a day, girl
Let's call it a day, girl...
