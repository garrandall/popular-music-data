They never knew my struggle
Rose above the rubble
Rather live inside they bubble
Than go through the trouble
Of having they double-double vision corrected
They just neglect it and-
I've been thinkin' lately
Will the Devil take me?
Or will God protect me?
I know I ain't perfect, but you should respect me
They don't want me happy
They don't want to let me live


I'm young and I'm foolish, I made bad decisions
I block out the news, turn my back on religion
Don't have no degree, I'm somewhat naÃ¯ve
I've made it this far on my own
But lately, that shit ain't been gettin' me higher
I lift up my head and the world is on fire
There's dread in my heart and fear in my bones
And I just don't know what to say

Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
I have never believed in you, no
But I'm gonna pray


I am me
I'm a man, I'm a sinner
But understand, aren't we all?
So when it comes to passin' judgements
I don't think that you're the one to make the call
Heaven want to cast me out for being me
I know there's others like me that'll break the fall
I know you hater motherfuckers just can't relate at all
If I'm the first one to the line, that's fine, I'll take it all
Well Logic, He gon' let 'em know
I ain't perfect, but I'm worth it
I'm alive, I deserve it
I been praying, I ain't playin'
I don't think you hear the words that I'm sayin'
I don't think you know the weight on my shoulders
That gets heavier as I get older
Callin' anybody, callin' anybody
"Can you hear me?"
I pray that you hear me
I pray that you hear me


Maybe I'll pray (Lord), pray (Lord), maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you, no, but I'm gonna...

Won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end
Oh, won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end

Oh, I'm gonna pray
I'm gonna pray
I'm gonna pray
Pray for a glimmer of hope
Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you
No, but I'm gonna pray
