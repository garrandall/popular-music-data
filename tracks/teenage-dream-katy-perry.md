You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me
So I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me
I was alright, but things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine


Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever


You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back


We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete


Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever


You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back


I'mma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight...)


(You make me)
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back (No)
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real (Oh, oh)
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back


I'mma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight...)
