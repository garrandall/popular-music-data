I think you're pretty without any makeup on
I think you're funny when you tell the punchline wrong
I knew you got me when you let your walls come down, down

Before you met me I was alright
But things were kinda heavy, you brought me to life
Now every February you'll be my valentine

Let's just talk all through the night
There's no need to rush
We can dance until we die
You and I will be young forever

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep, let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch now baby I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back,
Don't ever look back

When you're around me life's like a movie scene
I wasn't happy until you became my queen
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

Let's just talk all through the night
There's no need to rush
We can dance until we die
You and I will be young forever

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep, let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch now baby I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back,
Don't ever...

I will get your heart racing if that's what you need
In this teenage dream tonight
Let you rest your head on me if that's what you need
In this teenage dream tonight

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep, let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch now baby I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back,
Don't ever...

I will get your heart racing if that's what you need
In this teenage dream tonight
Let you rest your head on me if that's what you need
In this teenage dream tonight
