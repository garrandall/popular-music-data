I forget where I'm goin' in my own house
I got myself in this, I'll get myself out
I talk out loud, at the top of my voice I sing
Whoa keep the faith, see what tomorrow brings

I can't get over you
Try as I may oh it no use
My heart just cant leave you alone
My mind wont believe you're gone
I can't get over you

I got a front row seat here to a fool's masquerade
And that fool in the mirror keeps sayin' I'm doin' ok
I stare at that door that you walked out
It hits me hard and leaves no doubt

I can't get over you
Try as I may oh it no use
My heart just cant leave you alone
My mind wont believe you're gone
I can't get over you

I can't get over you
Try as I may oh it no use
My heart just cant leave you alone
My mind wont believe you're gone
I can't get over you
