You make me feel out of my element
Like I'm walkin' on broken glass
Like my world's spinnin' in slow motion
And you're movin' too fast


Were you right? Was I wrong?
Were you weak? Was I strong?
Yeah, both of us broken
Caught in a moment
We lived and we loved
And we hurt, and we jumped, yeah
But the planets all aligned when you looked into my eyes
And just like that, the chemicals react
The chemicals react


You make me feel out of my element
Like I'm driftin' out to the sea
Like the tide's pullin' me in deeper
Makin' it harder to breathe
We cannot deny how we feel inside
We cannot deny


Were you right? Was I wrong?
Were you weak? Was I strong?
Yeah, both of us broken
Caught in a moment
We lived and we loved
And we hurt, and we jumped, yeah
But the planets all aligned when you looked into my eyes
And just like that, the chemicals react
The chemicals react


Kaleidoscope of colors turnin'
Hopes on fire, sun is burnin'
Shinin' down on both of us
Don't let us lose it
Don't let us lose it


Were you right? Was I wrong?
Were you weak? Was I strong?
Yeah, both of us broken
Caught in a moment
We lived, and we loved
And we hurt, and we jumped, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
We lived, we loved
We hurt, we jumped
We're right, we're wrong
We're weak ,we're strong
We lived to love
But the planets all aligned
When you looked in to my eyes
And just like that, watch the chemicals react
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And just like that, the chemicals react
Yeah, yeah, yeah
The chemicals react
