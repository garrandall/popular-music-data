Somebody is sleeping in my bed
That's a bad thing to say, but it's the truth, ha
Somebody is sleeping in my bed
Oh yeah, yeah

I know I shoulda been there
But I was some place else instead
Lord have mercy, yes I was
And this is what made it so bad

I had myself a real good woman
To hear my every call
I acted a fool and left her
For little or no reason at all

And lord, can't go over losing her
And I know it was all my fault
She begged and she pleaded with me
To sit down and have a good talk

Even when I was gone
She said that she cried all alone
And that's why somebody's sleeping in my bed
Oh yes, sleeping in my...
Oh, don't you know it hurts so bad
Oh, I can hardly stand it

Just when I was thinking of coming home
She called me on, she called me, she called me
She called me on the telephone
You know what she said to me?

"Baby, I'm soon to be wed
Somebody will soon be sleeping in your bed"
Oh don't you know it hurt me so bad
This is what hurt me so bad
If I had treated my baby right, I'd be sleeping in my own bed
Oh yes I would now

Oh baby, let me call you sometime
Baby, won't you take me back there
Baby, baby baby
Don't you know I need you girl
Oh baby, don't...
