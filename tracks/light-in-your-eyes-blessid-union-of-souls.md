I can't remember the last time that we kissed goodbye 
All our "I love you's" were just not enough to survive 
Something your eyes never told me 
But it's only now too plain to see 
Brilliant disguise when you hold me 
And I'm free 
I've been thinking and here's what I've come to conclude 
Sometimes the distance is more than two people can use 
But how could I have known girl 
It was time and not space you would need 
Darling tonight I could hold you and you would know 
But would you believe 
There's a light in your eyes that I used to see 
There's a place in your heart where I used to be 
Was I wrong to assume that you were waiting for me 
There's a light in your eyes 
Did you leave that light burning for me 
Cards and phone calls and photograph pictures of you 
Constant reminder of all the things you get used to 
Is there a chance in hell or heaven 
That there's still something here to build on 
Or do you just pick up the pieces after they fall 
But after all 
There's a light in your eyes that I used to see 
And a song in the words that you spoke to me 
Was I wrong to believe in your melody 
There's a light in your eyes 
Did you leave that light burning for me 
Should I keep on waiting or does love keep on fading away 
Fading away 
It's been a while since I've seen you so how have you been 
Did you get my letter I wrote you, but I did not send 
I tried to call your old number 
But the voice that I heard on the phone 
I recognized but she told me the number was wrong 
There's a light in my eyes but it's too bright to see 
And a pain in my heart where you used to be 
Guess I was wrong to assume that you were waiting here for me 
There's a light in your eyes 
Did you leave that light burning for me
