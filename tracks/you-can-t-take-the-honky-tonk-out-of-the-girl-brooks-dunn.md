Connie came back for her second cousin's wedding
First time she'd been home in a year or two
Just in time for the rehearsal dinner
That crazy Connie wasn't wearing any shoes


Yeah, she lives in LA, she flies to New York City
That woman's been around the world
You can take the girl out of the honky tonk
But you can't take the honky tonk
Take the honky tonk out of the girl
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh


Well, that dinner broke up at around 11:30
Boys went out to do what boys do
And Connie said hey girls lets huddle up
Around something 'bout a hundred proof


She lives in LA, she flies to New York City
That woman's been around the world
You can take the girl out of the honky tonk
But you can't take the honky tonk
Take the honky tonk out of the girl
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh


Well, at nine a.m., out in front of that church
People are going nuts, looking for the groom
And somebody says hey Bonnie by the way where is Connie
She's run off with that boy to Cancun


Yeah, she lives in LA, she flies to New York City
That woman's been around the world
You can take the girl out of the honky tonk
But you can't take the honky tonk
Take the honky tonk out of the girl
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
