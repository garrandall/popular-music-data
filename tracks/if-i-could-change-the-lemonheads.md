Well Ive been called a dope before
Say Im not sexy anymore for you               
Say I am an animal  
Say I'm not a man at all, it's True! 

CHORUS  
I am a rabbit
Ive got to have it
Its a force of habit
I'd like to share my carrot.........with you

Say I've got a one track mind
But I just want to have a grind with you...
I don't wanna marry you I just want to get through to you.....

CHORUS 

BRIDGE----
I must of been a bliss too
Say Im not concerned
But I don't wanna go with you 
To the point of no return
Thats because I'm a rabbit..

SOLO
If you are a real die-hard you can always try the "Sweet Child O' Mine" Solo on it. Actually you should do this on all Hate Your Friends Songs.

CHORUS 



"I Am A Rabbit" - Proud Scum
----------------------------------
copyright 1979 Alistair Rabbit

--Verse 1--
You say you've seen my kind before
That I'm not sexy any more
Nor are you!
You say I am an animal
That I'm not like a man at all
Well it's true!

--Chorus--
I am a rabbit
I've got to have it
It's force of habit
I'd like to share my carrot
With you

--Verse 2--
You say I've got a one track mind
That I just want to have a grind
With you
Well I don't to marry you
I just want to get through
You

--Chorus x 1--

--Bridge--
You're just a bit of lettuce as far as I'm concerned
I don't want to go with you to the point of no return
That's because I am a rabbit
(solo)

--Chorus x 1--
(last 2 lines change to "I'd like to stick my carrot/Into you!"
