I remember all my life
Raining down as cold as ice
Shadows of a man
A face through a window cryin' in the night
The night goes into
Morning just another day
Happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes
I see a memory
I never realized
How happy you made me

Oh Mandy well
You came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away
Oh, Mandy
Well, you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today
Oh, Mandy!

I'm standing on the edge of time
I've walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world of uphill climbing
The tears are in my mind and nothin' is rhyming

Oh Mandy well,
You came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away.
Oh, Mandy
Well, you kissed me and stopped me from shaking,
And I need you today
Oh, Mandy!

Yesterday's a dream
I face the morning
Crying on a breeze
The pain is calling
Oh Mandy
Well, you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away oh, Mandy
Well, you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today oh, Mandy
You came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away oh, Mandy
You kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you
