I am the man for you baby (I am the man)
To give you love and tenderness, my baby (I know that I can)

You search for the key to love, my darling
But it's been hard to find
'Cause on every heart you found a lock
But there's not a lock on mine, oh
I found you crying, so tired of trying
Sitting by yourself alone, girl
Reached out my hand, helped you to stand
Held you 'til your tears were gone, my darling
Oh yeah
Your eyes are dry now, open to see
Your search is ending right here with me, girl
Oh yeah, because

I am the man for you baby (I am the man)
To give you love and tenderness, my baby (I know that I can)
If you need someone to love and guide you (I am the man)
To lead you from the dark and stand beside you (I am the man)

'Cause I got the love you need, my darling
I got the love you want (I got it)
I give the feeling, you get the loving
You can have all you want, oh
You let me console you
And you listened while I told you
Girl, that you can stop the running
If what you need is loving, baby
Oh yeah
You can keep looking but soon you'll see
Your tracks will lead you right back to me, girl
Oh yeah, because

I am the man (I am the man)
Don't you know I'm the man (I know that I can)
If you need someone to wipe your crying eyes (I am the man)
To show you to a sweet enchanted paradise (I know that I can)
I am the man for you baby (I am the man)
To give you love and tenderness, my baby (I know that I can)

So come on and walk with me, my darling
Reach out your hand to me (I got it)
Your search is over, lean on my shoulder
I'll make you so happy because

I am the man for you baby (I am the man)
To give you love and tenderness, my baby (I know that I can)
I'll give you all the love, my darling, you will ever need
I'll give you my whole heart and soul if you come walk with me
I'm the man, oh yes I am
Oh, I'm the man
You better believe that I'm the man
I'm the man
