It was a Friday night
No cover but that cover band was sounding right
And there you were, just flirty dancing by the neon sign
To fishing in the dark you were reeling in my heart
And now look where we are

I'm hooked on
Kissing you, getting, getting you turned on
Buzzing and loving on you all night long
Like a hit song on the radio
You already know the way it goes
All it took was a look and
I was hooked on
The way that you taking, taking my shirt off
And running my fingers through your long blonde
Hair falling in your eyes
Like the first time they caught mine
All it took was a look and I was
Hooked

It's Saturday
You still asleep and I can leave but no way
This ain't a one night fling kinda thing
Wanna wake you up, wanna press my luck
And my lips on your cheek like I can't enough 'cause

I'm hooked on
Kissing you, getting, getting you turned on
Buzzing and loving on you all night long
Like a hit song on the radio
You already know the way it goes
All it took was a look and
I was hooked on
The way that you taking, taking my shirt off
And running my fingers through your long blonde
Hair falling in your eyes
Like the first time they caught mine
All it took was a look and I was
Hooked

You've got me hooked on
Kissing you, getting, getting you turned on
Buzzing and loving on you all night long
Like a hit song on the radio
You already know the way it goes
All it took was a look and
I was hooked on
The way that you taking, taking my shirt off
And running my fingers through your long blonde
Hair falling in your eyes
Like the first time they caught mine
All it took was a look and I was
Hooked
