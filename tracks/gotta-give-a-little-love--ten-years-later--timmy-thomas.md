You gotta give a little love
To receive a little bit back
You gotta give a little bit of this and that
If you want a little bit back

You gotta give a little love to your fellow man
If you want to see the go round
You gotta give a little hope for the future
If you want this train to stay love-bound

It's been ten long years
Where have we gone from there
And I hope and I pray
That we all will someday
Live together and share

Gotta give a little love to the young
So they won't feel no reason for doubt
You gotta give a little love to the twilight years
So they too won't feel left out

You gotta give a little love to the world
So we can build a better chain
Lock up all that hatred
And the world will never be the same

It's been ten long years
Where have we gone from there
And I hope and I pray
That we all will someday
Live together and share

You gotta give a little love
To receive a little bit back
You gotta give a little bit of this and that
If you want a little bit back
