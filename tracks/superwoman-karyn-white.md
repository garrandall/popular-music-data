Early in the morning I put breakfast at your table
And make sure that your coffee has it's sugar and cream
Your eggs are overeasy
Your toast done lightly
All that's missing is your morning kiss that used to greet me
Now you say the juice is sour
It used to be so sweet
And I can't help but to wonder if you're talking about me
We don't talk the way we used to talk
It's hurting so deep
I've got my pride
I will not cry
But it's making me weak


I'm not your superwoman
I'm not the kind of girl
That you can let down
And think that everything is okay
Boy I am only human
This girl needs more than occasional hugs
As a token of love from you to me


I fought my way through the rush hour trying to make it home just for you
I want to make sure that your dinner will be waiting for you
But when you get there you just tell me
You're not hungry at all
You said you'd rather read the paper
And you don't want to talk
You like to think that I'm just crazy
When I say that you've changed
I'm convinced I know the problem
You don't love me the same
You're just going through the motions
And you're not being fair
I've got my pride
I will not cry
Still I can't help but care


I'm not your superwoman
I'm not the kind of girl
That you can let down
And think that everything is okay
Boy I am only human
This girl needs more than occasional hugs as a token of love from you to me

I'm not your superwoman
I'm not the kind of girl
That you can let down
And think that everything is okay
Boy I am only human
This girl needs more than occasional hugs as a token of love from you to me


Oh, baby
Look into the corners of your mind
I'll always be there for you through good and bad times
But I can't be the superwoman that you want me to be
I'll give my everlasting love if you'll return love to me


I'm not your superwoman
I'm not the kind of girl
That you can let down
And think that everything is okay
Boy I am only human
This girl needs more than occasional hugs as a token of love from you to me


Oh!
If you feel it in your heart
And you understand me
Stop right where you are
Everybody sing along with me
(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...)
I'm the kind of girl that can treat you so sweet
But you got to realize that you got to be sweeter to me
I need love
I need just your love


I'm not your superwoman
I'm not the kind of girl
That you can let down
And think that everything is okay
Boy I am only human
This girl needs more than occasional hugs as a token of love from you to me
