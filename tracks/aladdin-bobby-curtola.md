(Aladdin, Aladdin, Aladdin)

I had a strange exciting
Dream last night
I was a wanderer
With no love in sight

When all at once
I saw his magic light
Aladdin standing there

He asked me if I
Had a wish to make
I thought of you and
Knew the wish I'd take

He rubbed his lamp
And then he said, awake
Aladdin, I'm on my way

I've come to tell you of my love
He said that you care too
Now in your arms
I know he's right
He made it all come true

I'd like to meet him
In a dream tonight
And give my thanks
For showing me the light

I'd like to tell him
He was, oh, so right
Aladdin, now she's mine

I've come to tell you of my love
He said that you care too
Now in your arms
I know he's right
He made it all come true

I'd like to meet him
In a dream tonight
And give my thanks
For showing me the light

I'd like to tell him
He was, oh, so right
Aladdin, now she's mine

(Aladdin, Aladdin, Aladdin)
