Dick and Dedee
Thou shalt not steal
Thou shalt not steal
That's what the Good Book says
Ya, ya, ya, ya
Thou shalt not steal
Thou shalt not steal
But somebody is a stealing
You away from me
I wonder if he really don't know
That he'll reap exactly what he sows
If he don't he'll find out someday
When somebody steals you from him
He'll be crying that thou shalt not steal
Thou shalt not steal
That's what the Good Book says
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
