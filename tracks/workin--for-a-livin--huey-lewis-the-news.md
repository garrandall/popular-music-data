Somedays won't end ever and somedays pass on by, 
I'll be working here forever, at least until I die. 
Dammed if you do, dammed if you don't 
I'm supposed to get a raise next week, you know damn well I won't. 

Workin' for a livin' (workin') 
Workin' for a livin' (workin') 
Workin' for a livin', livin' and workin' 
I'm taking what they giving 'cause I'm working for a livin'. 

Hey I'm not complaining 'cause I really need the work 
Hitting up my buddy's got me feeling like a jerk 
Hundred dollar car note, two hundred rent. 
I get a check on Friday, but it's already spent.

Workin' for a livin' (workin') 
Workin' for a livin' (workin') 
Workin' for a livin', livin' and workin' 
I'm taking what they giving 'cause I'm working for a livin'. 

Ooh, workin' for a livin' 
Ooh, taking what they giving 
Ooh, workin' for a livin' 
Ooh, ooh

Bus boy, bartender, ladies of the night 
Grease monkey, ex-junky, winner of the fight 
Walking on the streets, its really all the same 
Selling souls, rock n' roll, any other day 

Workin' for a livin' (workin')
Workin' for a livin' (workin')
Workin' for a livin', livin' and workin'
I'm taking what they giving 'cause I'm working for a livin'
Workin' for a livin', livin' and workin'
I'm taking what they giving 'cause I'm working for a livin'
Workin' for a livin', livin' and workin'
