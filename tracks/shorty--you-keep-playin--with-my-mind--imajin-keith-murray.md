Featuring keith murray

1 - shorty you keep playin' with my mind
You tease me all the time but I had enough
Maybe I should ask your girlfriends why
Why you are so afraid to fall in love

Girl I won't get next to you
You know I don't like sweatin' you
But something 'bout the way you make me feel
You got me in this fantasy
And all my friends keep tellin' me
Shorty's kinda hot, so what's the deal?

2 - 'cause we been spendin', rollin', livin', showin'
We got some time for play
But you've been player hatin', waitin'
For this rhyme to pass away

Repeat 1

You only get the best with me
I wanna give you everything
And anything you ask of me I will
And I don't want to front on you
So tell me what you wanna do
And if I'm not the one
Just keep it real

Repeat 2

Repeat 1


Now first of all baby, what's my name?
Spell it backwards you read game
I'm known for splittin' wigs and readin' brains
And when I say splittin' wigs and readin' brains
I mean breakin' it down conversation-wise
Let me explain

I'm in your corner, girl be on my team
Together we could fulfill each other's life dream
We both gemini so we got 2 sides
Our zodiac sign is the perfect sign
'cause she replied, "all gemini's lie"
I guess this is what it feels like when doves cry
Your attitude is deep cover
Won't give me the number
Cold play me out like a foul, a bleep or a blunder
It's like a burnin' in the chest, a cardiac arrest
You look like you havin' fun puttin' me thru stress
So in between time and in the meantime
You do your thing and I do mine
But don't play wit my mind

Shorty, shorty
Won't you please get naughty with me
And if you really wanna
I can be your fantasy
You are so afraid, oh baby

Repeat 1 until fade
