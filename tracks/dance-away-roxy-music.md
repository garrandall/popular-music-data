Yesterday - well it seemed so cool
When I walked you home, kissed goodnight
I said "it's love" you said "all right"
It's funny how I could never cry
Until tonight and you pass by
Hand in hand with another guy
You're dressed to kill and guess who's dying'

Dance away the heartache
Dance away, tears
Dance away the heartache
Dance away, fears
Dance away...

Loneliness is a crowded room
Full of open hearts turned to stone
All together all alone
All at once my whole world had changed
Now I'm in the dark, off the wall
Let the strobe light up them all
I close my eyes and dance till dawn

Dance away the heartache
Dance away, tears
Dance away the heartache
Dance away, fears
Dance away...
Dance away...
Dance away...

Now I know I must walk the line
Until I find an open door
Off the street onto the floor
There was I - many times a fool
I hope and pray, but not too much
Out of reach is out of touch
All the way is far enough

Dance away the heartache
Dance away, tears
Dance away the heartache
Dance away, fears
Dance away the heartache
Dance away, tears
Dance away the heartache
Dance away, fears
Dance away the heartache
Dance away, fears
