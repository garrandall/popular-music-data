My baby, she may not a-look
Like one of those bunnies out of the playboy club
But she got somethin' much greater than gold
Crazy 'bout that girl 'cause she got so much soul

I said she got the kind of lovin', kissin' and a-huggin'
Sure is mellow, glad that I'm her fellow
And I know that she knocks me off my feet
(Have mercy on me)
'Cause she knocks me off my feet

There is no girl in the whole world
That can love me like you do, yeah

Oh, my baby when she walks by
All the fellows go, oh, and I know why
It's simply 'cause that girl, she looks so fine
And if she ever leaves me I would lose my mind

She got the kind of lovin', kissin' and a-huggin'
Sure is mellow, glad that I'm her fellow
And I know that she knocks me off my feet
(Have mercy on me)
'Cause she knocks me off my feet, hey

There is no girl in the whole world
That can love me like you do

Hey, everybody in the neighborhood
Will testify that my girl, she looks so good now
Yeah, she's so fine, she'd give eyesight to the blind
And if she ever leaves me I would lose my mind

She got the kind of lovin', kissin' and a-huggin'
Sure is mellow glad that I'm her fellow
And I know that she knocks me off my feet
(Have mercy on me)
'Cause she knocks me off my feet

There is no girl in the whole world
That can love me like you do
Baby, yeah, feel yeah, it's alright
Mercy, mercy, mercy
