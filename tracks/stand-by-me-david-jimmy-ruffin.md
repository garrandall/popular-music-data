When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see

No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

So darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me
Oh stand, stand by me, stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me
Oh stand now, stand by me, stand by me

And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me
Oh, stand now, stand by me, stand by me

Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me
Oh stand by me, won't you stand now
Oh stand, stand by me
