Why must I love you so much?
Sandy, I long for your touch

A better luck the next time Sandy
I gotta tell ya that we're through
A find a guy who's always handy
A listen girl I'm leavin' you

I love a girl around the corner
Just found out that she's no good
I left her, didn't even want her
But I'd crawl back if I could

Why must I love you so much?
Sandy, I long for your touch
I never thought you'd put me down
I can't believe that you're untrue
And now the new is out around town
Yeah, what eels can I do?

Oh it's worth this pain
I can't explain, oh, and all those tears
I cry for you (wop, wop, wop...)
A better luck the next time Sandy
I've gotta tell you that we're through
A find a guy who's always handy
Listen girl I'm leavin' you

Why must I love you so much?
Sandy, I long for your touch
I never thought you would put me down
Can't believe that you're untrue
And now the news is out around town
Sandy babe what can I do?
