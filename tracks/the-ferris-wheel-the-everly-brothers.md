I'll ride the rollercoaster or the carousel
I like the Spider and the diving bell
But since she's gone I don't like so well
The ferris wheel
I'll ride the Rockoplane or the Tilterwhirl
It wasn't on these rides I lost my girl
Way up high is where I lost her
On a ferris wheel
Pretty Ferris Wheel by your colored lights
I saw someone steal her kiss from her that ni-ight
I'll pay my fair and ride the bumper cars
Those turning cars won't make the teardrops start
But way up there is where she broke my heart
On the ferris wheel
On the ferris wheel
On the ferris wheel
