I'll ride the roller coaster or the carousel
I like the spider and the diving bell
But since she's gone I don't like so well
The Ferris Wheel

I'll ride the rock-o plane or the Tilter-Whirl
It wasn't on these rides I lost my girl
Way up high is where I lost her
On the Ferris Wheel

Pretty Ferris Wheel
By your coloured lights
I saw someone steal
A kiss from her that night

I'll pay my fare and ride the bumper cars
Those funny cars won't make the teardrops start
But way up there is where she broke my heart
On the Ferris Wheel
On the Ferris Wheel
On the Ferris Wheel...
