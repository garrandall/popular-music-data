I spent 20 years trying to get out of this place
I was looking for something I couldn't replace
I was running away from the only thing I've ever known

Like a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone

I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold

I been there, done that and I ain't looking back on the seeds I've sown
Saving dimes, spending too much time on the telephone

Who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go home

There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rolling stone, who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go back, been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I want to go, who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright
I went as far as I could, I tried to find a new face
There isn't one of these lines that I would erase
I lived a million miles of memories on that road
With every step I take I know that I'm not alone
You take the home from the boy, but not the boy from his home
These are my streets, the only life I've ever known
Who says you can't go home
I been there, done thatand I ain't looking that
It's been a long long road
Feels like I never left, that's how the story goes
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter where you go
If it's a million miles aways or just a mile up the road
Take it in, take it with you when you go
Who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright
Who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright
Who says you can't go home
