I'm not alone

I know you feel it

So much deeper than we can see

Blood runs strong

And all my emotions, have taken their toll on me

A lonely battle another night

I don't wanna fight anymore

Nobody wins in this war

Two hearts are breakin

Is there an end in sight

Don't keep me waitin

Cause I can't fight anymore

Nobody wins in this war

It's you and I and nothing else matters

It's all of the love that you've given me

We will survive if we lay down are weapons

While we've still got time

Will you surrender, or give it up

Cause I don't wanna fight anymore

Nobody wins in this war

Two hearts are breakin

Is there an end in sight

Don't keep me waitin 'cause I can't fight anymore

Nobody wins in this war

These wounds of love need healing

I'm leavin it all in your hands

Oh yes Yes I am, baby

Nobody wins, Nobody wins in this war

Two hearts are breakin

Is there an end in sight

Don't keep me waitin 'cause I can't fight anymore

Nobody wins in this war (2x)

Nobody nobody nobody wins in this

Nobody nobody nobody wins in this

And I can't fight anymore

Nobody nobody nobody wins in this war
