Edith Sitwell giving readings
14 Moscow Road
Osbert's giving champagne parties
Sachie's got a cold
Gertrude's hanging pictures
Alice making tea
Me, I do the only thing that still
Makes sense to me
I do the Rock
I do the Rock Rock

John and Yoko farming beef
Raising protein quota
Sometimes they make love and art
Inside the Dakota
Rodney's feeling sexy
Mick is really frightfully bold
Me, I do the only thing
That stops me growing old
I do the Rock
I do the Rock Rock
I do the Rock Rock Rock

Well, it's stimulating

Solzhenitsyn feels exposed
Build a barbed-wired prison
Nietzsche's six feet under
But his babies still got rhythm
Einstein's celebrating ten decades
But I'm afraid philosophy
Is just too much responsibility for me
I do the Rock
I do the Rock

Baby Ruth and Dizzy Dean
Best and Colin Cowdrey
Little Mo, Virginia Wade
Pistol Pete and O.J
I've always like DiMaggio
And Rockne's pretty Knute you know
I could never whack a ball
With such velocity
I do the Rock
I do the Rock
I do the Rock

When I can get it
It's stimulating - I'm a keen student

Liz and Dick and Britt and Liza
Jaclyn, Kate and Farah
Meg and Roddy, John Travolta
Governor Brown and Linda
Interview and People Magazine
Miss Rona and the Queen
It must be really frightful
To attract publicity
I do the Rock
Myself
I do the Rock

Carter, Begin and Sadat
Brezhnev, Teng and Castro
Everyday negotiate us closer to disastro
Idi Amin and the Shah
And Al Fatah is quite bizarre
I could never get the hang of ideology

I do the Rock
I do the Rock
I do the Ro...
I do the Ro...
I do the Ro...
I do the Ro...
Do the Ro...
Do the Ro...
I do, I do, I do, I do
Do the Rock

Sunshine, Sunshinin' in
Sunshine, Sunshine
Well you can't get enough of it man
Sunshine, Sunshine
Oh, we got the top down now
If you don't have the top down, pull the top down
How often do you get a sunny day
Come to the rock, the rock will cure your ills, man
Stimulating, stimulating
Sunshine
Sunshine, Sunshine
Been a really hard winter, man
You deserve it, ya know
Everybody do, everybody do, everybody
Sunshine, Sunshine
