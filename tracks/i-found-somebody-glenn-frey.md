I never thought it could happen
It was the furthest thing from my mind
I just turned my back on a sad love affair
Was try'n' to leave it all behind
That's when I met you
I just couldn't say no
One look in your eyes
And I said here I go
I found somebody
I found somebody to love
I found somebody
I found somebody to love

I'd seen so much deceivin'
I almost stopped believin'
I'd ever fall in love again
I was runnin' around hidin' my heart
Fakin' it with all of my friends
I was down on my luck
That's when you came along
You put me back on my feet
You got me singin' this song

I found somebody
I found somebody to love
I found somebody
I found somebody to love
And she loves me in the midnight hour

You know ever since I found you
And put my arms around you
I don't need a doggone thing
You know that ev'ry day is such a beautiful day
I want the whole world to dance and sing
So don't you dare hang your head
Don't you dare be blue
If it can happen to me
It can happen to you

And you'll be singin' this song
I found somebody
I found somebody to love
I found somebody
I found somebody to love
