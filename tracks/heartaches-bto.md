Look at me, I was just a man who was lonely
Had some time on my hands
The world's greatest plans in my jeans
I saw you, you came to me like you knew me
I don't think you knew that it threw me
I didn't know what to say to you then
I knew it would end up in...

Heartaches
Visions of loving you and
Heartaches
Wishing we hadn't met for my sake
Seeing you here, is all I can stand

Every night I stand on the street where you left me
Standing in with the crowd
Trying not to look like I'm hangin' around
There you are, I see you once more and you're lovely
I try to tell myself, I'm not hungry
But every time you sway I get carried away
I need you more every day and my...

I'm only a man who has heartaches
Deep burning pain as my heart breaks
Watchin' you walk sets my soul aflame
I could put the blame on the world's oldest game

I know the ways, I know that to pay won't relieve me
Cause it's not from the heart
It's only the act not the flame
I only wait and hope for the love that you're holding
Deep down inside you've been holdin' for that special time
But I don't see a sign, it's just not your mind
And my...

Heartaches
Visions of loving you and
Heartaches
Wishing we hadn't met for my sake
Seeing you here, is all I can stand
I'm only a man who has heartaches
Deep burning pain as my heart breaks
Watchin' you walk sets my soul aflame
I could put the blame on the world's oldest game

Heartaches yeah yeah
Heartaches, heartaches
Let me tell you about my...
Heartaches, heartaches, heartaches
Let me tell you about my...
Heartaches, heartaches, oh
