Let me be the clock for the time of your life, oh, yeah
Let me be the pendulum that strikes your chime
For the first time

I'm a cuckoo I know
Counting hours till we will be together
When the door to my heart will open
It's for sure that I will be hopin', hopin' that you

Will let me be the clock for the time of your life
Oh, yeah, baby, oh, yeah, baby
And let me be the pendulum that strikes your chime
For the first time, let it begin

'Cause every moment we're apart is some good feeling wasted
A good feeling deep down inside me, told me
A good time for me to try to get you to hold me
Is right here and now

So let me be the clock for the time of your life
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, baby
And let me be the pendulum that strikes your chime
For the first time, for the first time

I wanna be your pendulum, baby
Striking your chime

Hickory dickory dock
I want to be your clock
Just set me for lifetime
And I'll wake you up every morning

Woo, woo, ooh, let me
Let me be the clock for the time of your life
For the time of your life, oh, yeah, ooh
Let me be the pendulum striking your chime
For the first time and every time after that
'Cause I know where it's at

So let me, let me, let me, let me
Let me, let me, baby, ooh, ooh
Let me be the pendulum striking your chime
For the first time, for the first time

Strike your chime one time, baby
Strike your chime one time
Let me be the pendulum striking your chime
For the first time

Let me be the clock for the time of your life, oh, yeah
And let me be the pendulum who's striking your chime
For the first time and every time after that
'Cause I know where it's at

So let me, let me, let me, let me
Let me, let me, baby, ooh, ooh
Let me be the pendulum striking your chime
