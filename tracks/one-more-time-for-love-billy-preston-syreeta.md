So you say you think
You're through with love
And there's no hope
In our future love

Let me share this
Feeling with you, love
Take my hand

If we close our eyes
And just forget the past
And believe that we can make
This new love last

Then our hearts
Will know the beauty
Of true love again

One more time for love
Let me hear that song again
One more time for love
One more time for love
Sing it again

Lovers love and lose
And feel the burning pain
With an attitude that
They'll never love again

But a change of heart
Will make the weather change
To soothing rain, whoa, oh

One more time for love
Let me hear that song again
One more time for love
Mmm, love me one more time
One more time for love
Sing it again

Oh, oh, baby
Lovers love and lose
And feel the burning pain
With an attitude that
They'll never wanna love again

But a change of heart
Will make the weather change
To soothing rain, whoa, oh

One more time for love
Let me hear that song again
One more time for love
One more time for love
Sing it again

Whoa, oh, oh
One more time for lobe

One more time for love
Let me hear that song again
One more time for love
Mmm, just love me one more time
One more time for love
Sing it again
