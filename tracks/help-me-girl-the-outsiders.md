Girl have you ever been hungry
So hungry that you had no pride?
Well I got that feeling
That biting, gnawing deep inside
It's a funny pain
One I can't explain
You gotta help me girl
Oh help me girl
'cause I'm going insane - hey hey

I know about all the good things
And what that long green stuff can buy
Right or wrong it's a groove girl
Yet somehow I'm not satisfied
You gotta show me the way
Turn my night into day
Oh help me girl
Oh help me girl
'cause I'm going insane
Oh, I need someone
Someone to comfort me
Be my someone
Be my reality girl

You gotta show me the way
And turn my night into day
Oh help me girl
Oh help me girl
'cause I'm going insane hey
Help me baby
Help me girl
Come on into my nights
Come on?to to? me today
I said help me baby
Help me girl
Come on into my days
Come on? way

I said help me baby
Help me girl
Come on enjoy the nights
Come one
Help me baby say come on

Help me girl
Help me baby come on into my days
Come on...
