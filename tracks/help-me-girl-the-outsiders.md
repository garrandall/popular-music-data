(You know what time it is when you hear this right)

Nothing seems certain
Nothing seems working
I was daydreaming, smoking weed out the curtain
Looking at my baby like rah, I'm just a burden
I'm trying hard but nothing seems to be working
I feel confused because the works that I am working
I cannot see the rewards I am deserving
It's big decisions fam and I am not certain
But in the lion's den, you cannot be nervous
Maintain my purpose
Kept it original, nothing but Werther's
Only a zookeeper can handle the circus
After Burst The Pipe they knew it was curtains
 my niggas keep trill like Gurkhas
Brixton midsummer murders
Got to the top of the hill with no Sherpas
Serving more than a servant
Out here being more than observant
Surrounded by tin-men and vermin
My past and future is definitely not certain
But Eminem style, G you know I will close man's curtain
My top came from Marks & Spencers, this never came from Burton
Banana clip for monkeys
Runaway whips in country
The flow's like weed with the munchies
Who's sitting on the wall blud? Acted a fool, playing Humpty Dumpty
You are in the presence of a gorilla, I am far from a monkey
BDL gang, man ain't eating right, here's a Snickers, you ain't the same when you hungry
Man bite the hands what feed them
Grab man's ankles, drag him to the bottom of the sea, welcome to where I live, the deep end
I only fuck with you when I'm high like The fucking Weeknd
Joke ting, man is on a coke ting, put a lot of hard food in the ocean
Lyca phone making calls to  tryna put something big in motion
, release the omen
Rastafari stands alone, I am Bingi, I am the child what is chosen
Pirate sessions, days of Cameo
Keeping it grimy, days of Logan
Been around for a moment, lone wolf, here's the return of the shogan
Death to any opponent
Grime is a feeling caught in the essence
Which I control the presence
Make man burst their pipe in a fucking moment
You though, I am lyrically fat like Sumo
Throw a MC like Judo
I've been the boss since Hugo
Please don't feed the animals, this ain't a normal place, it's a zoo bro
You was on don't, we are on do bro
Aliens, aliens, aliens, blue 'cause the team is on Pluto
I was going through pain, nothing's happening
Back to the same old travelling
Getting knicked on a ranom ting
Label's started to have enough, saying this yout' is mad, they can't handle him
They couldn't see what I see 'cause I am the king
Stop talk about base and the phone will ring
Game over, not by the hairs of a chinny chin chin
From a smile and a grin
People who are going through the pain what I'm in
It's my turn, rejoice this thing
Charlie I'm coming in
So don't give up, cus' get motivated
'Cause man can over-make it
BDL, history in the making
When that burner starts to spin
And an angel gets his wings
I ain't scared of anything
Embrace the pain, 'cause I've been blessed in every way
And I woke up again today
I'm not in jail or in a grave
G embrace the pain
On BD, Base

(BDL, Big Narstie, oi fam, you are an animal bro)
Charlie
(You are-you are an animal, animal... like, next level bro)
Charlie, Charlie bro
(Na I'm serious bro, I swear, I said at the top, you're one of my favourites, you are, like I listen to your ting and I get gassed)
Come on man
(And then you come and do Fire In The Booth and you get me gassed, I was like- I was dancing and that lot you know, don't show that on camera)
Big up Rippah on production init, come on
(Mad ting)
Spanking, I'm gonna take you on a journey right now, this one's a journey...
(Mad ting, we going again yeah?)
Yeah man, let's go
2003, before grime
U.K., the scene's a shithole
(Hahahaha)
Nothing ain't really gwarning
Everyone's looking for the bigger cheque, you get what I mean
Grime's like that ghetto goods girl from the hood
Along came the fat-fat sweat from Brixton, BDL, Big Narstie
Origins of N Double, first of his name
Trying to push this ting to glory, independently
Come with me
Come with me to victory
BDL - Base Defence League
Ay Charlie Sloth
(Let's get 'em)
Yo

Grime battle of Hastings
These niggas are faking
Sellouts get no ratings
Told man to claim their glory, man sword and shields were shaking
Now the dragon's awaking
King Narstie, BDL
First of his name, all hail the great king
Grime castle's a shithole, all of the walls are caved in
Only King Narstie and the BDL were the troops remaining
All for one and one for all, told man keep invading
Uncle Pains, grime releases, I push the enemies gates in
Man said the scene is our's, scene was under attack, you picked up the white flag and ran for pop music, fucking cowards
Only help, power OGs, up north, 0121
Traitors will die for treason, these fuckboys can do one
I gave them war

(Oi, oi, hahaha, oi, oi)
Bruv
Let me announce myself
(Hahaha)
I am Big Narstie, king of BDL, first of my name
House off  Street, Brixton 8
Come on man
(Woo, woo)
Hahahaha, aw man
(I-I'm sorry bro, I-I had to go again)
Aw man
(Let's go again, please)
Let's do it
(That was like a movie)
That's what it is
2013, beast, BG - Before Grime
DÃ©jÃ  vu, the scene's in terror init
Outsiders, tight pants and mohawks and dreams of funky house
And pop music is taking over the scene
Time in peril
Radio stations, grime raves ain't happening, promoters don't wanna book us
Who will put on a tour independently for the grime? Who will put on a tour?
Long live King Narstie

Grime battle of Hastings
These niggas are faking
Sellouts get no ratings
Told man to claim their glory, man sword and shields were shaking
Now the dragon's awaking
King Narstie, BDL
First of his name, all hail the great king
Grime castle's a shithole, all of the walls are caved in
Only King Narstie and the BDL were the troops remaining
All for one and one for all, told man keep invading
Uncle Pains, grime releases, I push the enemies gates in
Man said the scene is our's, scene was under attack, you picked up the white flag and ran for pop music, fucking cowards
Only help, power OGs, up north, 0121
Traitors will die for treason, you fuckboys can do one
Give them war
Pillage and plunder villages
Spread grime across the nation
Gave them a BDL tour
Told my squire, prepare my armour
Only dragons walk on lava
Who has the heart of a martyr
BDL, this is Sparta
BDL, attack, soldiers ride with me then
Every G you see in BD, they stand right here as free men
When you see these niggas on road, pop their chains and fucking free them
They remind me of slaves
I'll free niggas with base
R.I.P. the house nigga
Behold the prophecy of the Django
Is it wrong for me to know my worth as a man, bro?
I control the zoo, it's the BDL gang bro
Moshpits, kangaroos, man can go
I am lord of the ASBOs
I will put man's head on a spike, hang them over the bridges of London
Look inside their soul, there isn't a warrior amongst them
But man are warrior, warrior, take man's head like Co' The Conqueror
On this journey to hell, let's see who will follow ya
The night-watch begins, like seatbelts, I'm strapped in
You said retreat, I scream attack, that's why they call me the mad king
You possess the blood of a mongrel and a heart of a coward
Archers load the wall, give them hell, victory is our's
Stand here in the face tyranny
Mohawks and sell-outs in tight pants, cus' breach the walls
Common man across the land defend these walls
Claim your glory, embrace the iron price
Narstie Baratheon, true king, send them all to the lord of light
I will not go queitely, BDL when you mention grime
Hard work and patience multiplied by time
People power, mer-mer-mer-mer-mer-mer vibes!
, come with me man

Come on
(Oi that was epic man, they need to make that into a movie)
Come on, it's coming
(That-that-that could sit nice on Netflix, the )

(Yeah, dunno)
That's gonna be stiff
Grime battle of Hastings
(That was mad, that's like a little education as well fam)
Come on
(Are we going again?)
Yeah, boom, large up X on the beat
Let's take it down a notch
(Let's get 'em fam)
Pain
Yo, Jim Jones, may-may
R.I.P. Granddad

Came out the womb and it was doom
G, I had plastic, I never had no silver spoon
Poor ting pickney, every day we made do
God bless my mum, she looked in the cupboard and saw nothing, but give thanks, managed to make food
She kept on saying though, God will get us through
There's four people what are living in this yard
But the food she's cooking can feed two
Bro's in jail and dad ain't about, no more Cartoon Network, let's get loot
I weren't satisfied with scraping by
I weren't satisfied with making do
Everything's disfunctional
Turned me to a raging bull
Big man stress, I can't concentrate in school
Shot a Q to Patrick, pick up Paige from school
I ain't happy, plus my mind is breaking too
Looking through the windows of Frank Johnson's
Thinking how I'm gonna get them 95s in grey and blue
Road money put food in my fridge
And road money gave me clothes to go to school
I ain't accepting where my life is at
Tired of being the have not
Going inside a shop, knowing I couldn't buy that
So I'm on the beat, drums, including the high hats
Red bricks, Clapham, North G I'm tryna find cats
Money's where my mind's at
Gunpowder life got me sidetracked
Drifting from my fam because I wanted to be the man
Didn't give a damn, pain, that was my bad
Ten racks on the bed, mad, I nearly climaxed
Life's like a movie, and I'm watching it in IMAX
There's a elephant in the room, so we try act
And hide facts, but the fact is life went shit, road changed
Boy meets girl, what in a fairy tale?
Blud, but rah, the journey's hell
She don't love and I don't trust
And she's in love and I'm on lust
This ain't ending well
She's got it all together, baby I'm on the dark side
I'm just trying to avoid a cell
I see my brother love a girl from inside a cell
Pain, and that didn't end well
But all's well what ends well
Set ship and set sail
Paradise turns to heartbreak hotel
A lonely feeling what we both know well
I try to stick but it never seems to gel
I needed a , couldn't you see, baby girl?
That man was missing, gone, farewell
Man was wishing me but none of it was well
I felt trapped fam, like I was in a cell
I tried to give you me, but baby you wanted was Denzel
So farewell
Let's put this all in the nutshell
Pain, there is no fairy tale
You think you know but you don't know
How did man get here? Perseverance and hope
I was just a sailor on a boat
Taking orders from a captain, it took a while for me to see my own boat
There is no wrong, there is no right
This is just pain, hard times and sacrifice
Mummy on her grind
Doing 9 to 5
Plus the 5 to 9
Including the overtime
Coming home to see if man is alright
Yeah man's going school in the day, staying with mum at the mad house at night
Picture perfect, seeing niggas with their dad, man used to cry when I would think about mine
In my time, she was my Superwoman
Doing things for me, deep down blud, I knew she couldn't
I'm gangbanging, tryna provide, understand she wouldn't
But gave me unconditional love even though she shouldn't
The safest place in this world was my mother's 
Cus' it's mad, yeah we drifted because she started pulling
My Mount Olympus falling, crazy church songs singing in my head
Mummy bailing me out saying "Son, it's gonna be prison or death"
Pain

(Wow, wow)
Stiff
(Mad, I don't know what to say bro... you never fail to amaze me cus')
Tsh, pain
(We just-we just went through a whole array of emotions there)
Hahaha
(We went from being gassed...)
Come on man, it's bipolar
(To like being entertained and then... pain)
Bipolar fam, you get me
(Bro, one of the greatest man)
Thank you my brother
Jim Jones, ledge, Mads
(One of the greatest)
Telling you... Speechless
(That's how I feel, that was mad bro, I had goosebumps man, mad...)
(Have we got more for them Narstie yeah?)
Go on then
We'll do this one on the American tip
Yo, whaddup-whaddup shorty
(Whaddup son?)
I do
(I-I weren't answering to shorty there by the way, just putting that out there)
Hahaha
Yo

I'm tryna chase the P
Plus I'm tryna chase a dream
AL, BDL, blue cus', man throw the sea
Two ends, two lines, bare workers, it's crazy
I control a team
These man are funny like Mr. Bean
Strapped yout's could go bang, now it goes shh
Get what I mean?
Eyes on the prize, I'm clapping clean
Back and spleen
I'll be peeling backs off like tangerines
It's gonna take a lot to manage me
I'm tryna change the levels, I'm tryna change the change
I'm tryna change the thinking, I'm tryna pave the way
I'm tryna be a idol, Seans and Kingston plus he's suicidal
Times is hard, nigga read the bible
 fat kid, dark skin
Squeeze on my notes on the main road
If you wanna go then say so
What the fuck G, blud man move more food than Waitrose
Pound Sterling, Pesos
45 ghostride, no lie, '05, bang man ting on main road
Black car, black matte, call me the black knight
It's pain, even the devil may cry
'Cause everyone has got a devil inside
How can a man have a pure heart but still have a devilish mind?
I feel like a paratrooper caught deep inside the enemy's lines
Is it wrong to take a life?
If if means I'm saving mine
Hand to hand combat, disarm the enemy, then physically take his face from spine
Operation on a G man, tip can't save man's life
That means get home alive
That means burst the pipe
That means burst it
Pain, Mac 10 hanging out the whip
Rage, man better know what I'm on
Ouch, man better know what it is
More than clothes and kicks
To my niggas in the bits feeling pain in their ribs
No time for fucking...
I grow weed like mandem grow their kids
