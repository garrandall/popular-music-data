I had a date with a pretty ballerina
Her hair so brilliant that it hurt my eyes
I asked her for this dance and then she obliged me
Was I surprised, yeah
Was I surprised, no, not at all

I called her yesterday
It should have been tomorrow
I could not keep the joy that was inside
I begged for her to tell me if she really loved me
Somewhere a mountain is moving
Afraid it's moving without me

La la la laaaa
La la

I had a date with a pretty ballerina
Her hair so brilliant that it hurt my eyes
I asked her for this dance and then she obliged me
Was I surprised, yeah
Was I surprised, no, not at all

And when I wake on a dreary Sunday morning
I open up my eyes to find there's rain
And something strange within says, "Go ahead and find her
Just close your eyes, yeah
Just close your eyes, and she'll be there"
She'll be there
She'll be there
