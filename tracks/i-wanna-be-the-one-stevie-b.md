Late at night
When I'm all alone
I think of you and I'm feeling strong
I'm wishing you would just look my way
Let me be the one

My heart is aching for that special girl
To come on in and share my world
Someone to love and someone to hold
Let me be the one
I love you

I need you, girl
And I need you now
I'll get you looking at me somehow
The love I have is an open door, girl
Come on in
Let's begin
I love you

I wanna be the one
You're giving your loving
I wanna be the one
You're kissing and hugging
I wanna be the one
You dream of at night
Let me be the one
I love you

I wanna be the one
You're kissing and hugging
I wanna be the one
You're giving your loving
I wanna be your honey
Sugar and spice
Let me be the one
I love you, baby

I don't believe it should take so long
To find someone I can call my own
Just come more close
And you'll feel my love
It's a burning love, my baby

My heart is aching for that special girl
To come on in
And share my world
Someone to love
And someone to hold
Let me be the one, my baby

I need you girl
And I need you now
I'll get you looking at me somehow, baby
The love I have is an open door, girl
Come on in
Let's begin
I love you

I wanna be the one
You're giving your loving
I wanna be the one
You're kissing and hugging
I wanna be the one
You dream of at night
Let me be the one
I love you

I wanna be the one
You're kissing and hugging
I wanna be the one
You're giving your loving
I wanna be your honey
Sugar and spice
Let me be the one
I love you, baby

My
I need you, girl
And I need you now
I'll get you looking at me somehow, baby
The love I have is an open door, girl
Come on in
Let's begin
I love you

I wanna be the one
You're giving your loving
I wanna be the one
You're kissing and hugging
I wanna be the one
You dream of at night
Let me be the one
I love you

I wanna be the one
You're kissing and hugging
I wanna be the one
You're giving your loving
I wanna be your honey
Sugar and spice
Let me be the one
I love you
