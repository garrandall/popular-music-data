I'm struttin' my stuff, ya'll
I'm struttin' my stuff, ya'll
I'm struttin' my stuff, ya'll
I'm struttin' my stuff, ya'll

You all might like to hustle
Or do the bump
Or any dance you want
When I get out on the floor
I just wanna strut my stuff

Got a pretty mama in Atlanta
Ain't nothin' but a Georgia peach
Strutted her stuff all the way
Down to West Palm Beach

I'm struttin' my stuff, ya'll
(Everyday-every night, ya'll)
I'm struttin' my stuff, ya'll
(Watch me work out one time people)
I'm struttin' my stuff, ya'll
I'm struttin' my stuff, ya'll

Carolina, Georgia
Tenn-e-see
I strut my stuff out any ol'
Place I be

Lousiana, Florida
Al-a-bam
I like it down there
'Cause it ain't no ham like
Birmingham

I'm struttin' my stuff, ya'll
(I think I got it, ya'll)
I'm struttin' my stuff, ya'll
(Watch me workout one time, ya'll now)
I'm struttin' my stuff, ya'll
I'm struttin' my stuff, ya'll

(I like the way you move
Can you get up and dance now?
Can you get up and dance now?
I like the way you get up
I like the way you move)
