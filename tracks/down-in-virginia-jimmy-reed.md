I went out in Virginia, honey, where the green grass grows
I went out in Virginia, honey, where the green grass grows
I try to tell myself that I didn't love you no more

My baby told me, "Honey, stop doin' me wrong!"
My baby told me, "Honey, stop doin' me wrong!"
Well I'm feeling you baby 'cause I'm tired of living alone

Well I can't help feeling, I know I'm doin' you wrong
Well I can't help feeling, I know I'm doin' you wrong
That's why I came beggin', I'm a one man standing alone

Way out in Virginia, honey, where the green grass grows
Way out in Virginia, honey, where the green grass grows
I try to tell myself that I didn't want you no more

Well I'm feeling you baby 'cause I'm tired of living alone
