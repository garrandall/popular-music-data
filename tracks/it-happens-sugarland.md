Missed my alarm clock ringing
Woke up, telephone screaming
Boss man singing his same old song
Rolled in late about an hour
No cup of coffee, no shower
Walk of shame with two different shoes on
Now it's poor me, why me, oh me, boring
The same old worn out blah blah story
There's no good explanation for it at all


Ain't no rhyme or reason
No complicated meaning
Ain't no need to over think it
Let go laughing
Life don't go quite like you planned it
We try so hard to understand it
The irrefutable, indisputable fact is
Pshh it happens


My trusty-rusty had a flat
I borrowed my neighbors cadillac
"I'll be right back," going down to wally world
That yellowed light turned red too quickly
Knew that truck the moment it hit me
Out stepped my ex and his new girl
"Sorry 'bout your neck baby"
But it's poor me, why me, oh me, boring
The same old worn out blah blah story
There's no good explanation for it at all


Ain't no rhyme or reason
No complicated meaning
Ain't no need to over think it
Let go laughing
Life don't go quite like you planned it
We try so hard to understand it
The irrefutable, indisputable fact is
Pshh it happens


Ain't no rhyme or reason
No complicated meaning
Ain't no need to over think it
Let go laughing
Life don't go quite like you planned it
We try so hard to understand it
The irrefutable, indisputable fact is
Yeah, the irrefutable, indisputable, absoluteable, totally beautiful fact is...Pshh, it happens
