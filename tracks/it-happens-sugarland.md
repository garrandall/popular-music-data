Missed my alarm clock ringing
Woke up, telephone screaming
Boss man singing his same old song

Rolled in late about an hour
No cup of coffee, no shower
Walk of shame with two different shoes on

Now it's poor me, why me, oh me,
Boring the same old worn-out blah-blah story
There's no good explanation for it at all

Ain't no rhyme or reason
No complicated meaning
Ain't no need to over-think it
Let go laughing

Life don't go quite like you planned it
We try so hard to understand it
The irrefutable, indisputable fact isâpshhâ
It happens

My trusty-rusty had a flat
I borrowed my neighbors Cadillac
"I'll be right back," going down to Wally World

That yellow light turned red too quickly
Knew that truck the moment it hit me
Out stepped my ex and his new girl
"Sorry 'bout your neck, baby."

But it is poor me, why me, oh me
Boring the same old worn-out blah-blah story
There is no good explanation for it at all

Ain't no rhyme or reason
No complicated meaning
Ain't no need to over-think it
Let go laughing

Life don't go quite like you planned it
We try so hard to understand it
The irrefutable, indisputable fact is
It happens

Ain't no rhyme or reason
No complicated meaning
Ain't no need to over think it
Let go laughing

Life don't go quite like you planned it
We try so hard to understand it
The irrefutable, indisputable fact is
Yeah, the irrefutable, indisputable, absoluteable, totally beautiful fact isâpshhâit happens
