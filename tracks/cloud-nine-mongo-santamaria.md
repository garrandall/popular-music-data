Childhood part of my life, it wasn't very pretty
You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city
It was a one room shack that slept ten other children besides me
We hardly had enough food or room to sleep
It was hard times
Needed something to ease my troubled mind
Listen! my father didn't know the meaning of work
He disrespected mama, and treated us like dirt
I left home, seekin' a job that I never did find
Depressed and downhearted I took to cloud nine
I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine
Listen one more time I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine
Folks down there tell me
They say, "give yourself a chance son, don't let life pass you by"
But the world of reality is a rat race where only the strongest survive
It's a dog eat dog world, and that ain't no lie
Listen! it ain't even safe no more to walk the streets at night
I'm doin' fine, on cloud nine
Let me tell you about cloud nine

Cloud nine, you can be what you wanna be
(cloud nine) you ain't got no responsibility
And every man, every man is free
(cloud nine) and you're a million miles from reality
I wanna say I love the life I live
And I'm gonna live the life I love up here on cloud nine
I'm riding high
On cloud nine, you're as free as a bird in flight
(cloud nine) there's no diff'rence between day and night
(cloud nine) it's a world of love and harmony
(cloud nine) you're a million miles from reality

Cloud nine, you can be what you wanna be
Cloud nine) you ain't got no responsibility
And every man, every man is free
(cloud nine) and you're a million miles from reality
(cloud nine) (cloud nine) (cloud nine)
