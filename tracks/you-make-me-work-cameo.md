Ow ow ow ow
Ow ow ow ow

Well I've been losin' my mind
And bustin' my behind
Trying to get you, girl
And I've been working so hard
I feel like you deserve a check
And I'm made of passion, girl
You know I'm really glad to meet you
When you're always sweeter
When you bust my drops
'cause you will work a man so hard
He'll drop down to his knees
I'm beggin' you baby baby please

You make me work all night
All night even in between
Why do you make me work all night?
But you never let up it seems

Now I work a hard job
Eight hours preachin' everyday
(work work)
So when I come over to see you
You know you can't treat me this way, no
I'm hung up and stressed out
Don't know what time it is
That's why I need you invested
In love that won't be bringing you tears
For years and years, that's why

You make me work all day
Overtime, even on my time
Why do you make me work?
I know you're nervous
But I can't keep everything
No, no, no, no, no

(You make me work hard)
I and I'm coming to get your love
It's hardly nine o'clock
(You make me work hard)
Oh baby, yeah

You make me work hard baby
To get your love (you prove me wrong)
You make me work hard baby
You make me work hard baby
To get your love
You make me work hard baby

Why do you make me work?
I work my behind off
I can't let you set me off
Why do you make me work?
I can't spend my time
Now I'm here about what's mine
Why do you make me work?
Make me work all night
Why do you make me work?
You treat me right

And I'm coming to get your love
Get your love, get your love
(you make me work hard)
Make minimum wage, baby!

You make me work hard baby
To get your love
You make me work hard baby
You make me work hard baby
To get your love
You make me work hard baby

Ow, ow ow, ow ow, ow
Ow, ow ow, ow ow, ow ow, ow

I got to work real hard even though
I do work even harder
To get problems solved you're too much
Watch your break it's the man in
Oh, my, my. I'm on my job
Work, work, work, work, work
