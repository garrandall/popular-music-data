Jonathan:
I wanna bring up Amy Lee from Evanescence

Amy Lee:
Your too sweet

Jonathan:
We thought this would be a cool song to do together so, um... ya'll enjoy

Jonathan:
Something takes a part of me
Something lost and never seen
Every time I start to believe
Something's raped and taken from me... from me
Life's got to always be messing with me

Amy Lee:
You wanna see the light

Jonathan:
Can't they chill and let me be free?

Amy Lee:
So do I

Jonathan:
Can't I take away all this pain?

Amy Lee:
You wanna see the light

Jonathan:
I try to every night, all in vain...

Both:
In vain

Both:
Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You'll never see me fall from grace
Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap (...) for me to lay
Something takes a part of me

Jonathan:
Feeling like a freak on a leash

Amy Lee:
You wanna see the light

Jonathan:
Feeling like I have no release

Amy Lee:
So do I

Jonathan:
How many times have I felt diseased?

Amy Lee:
You wanna see the light

Jonathan:
Nothing in my life is free... is free

Both:
Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You'll never see me fall from grace
Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap (...) for me to lay
Something takes a part of me

Jonathan:
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!

Both:
Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap (...) for me to lay
Something takes a part of me
Part of me
Part of me
Part of me
