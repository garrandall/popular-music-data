Maybe someday I'll be strong
Maybe it won't be long
I'll be the one who's tough, yeah
You'll be the one who's got it rough

It won't be long
And maybe I'll be real strong

Maybe I'll do things right
Maybe I'll start tonight
You'll learn to cry like me, girl
Baby, let's just wait and see

Maybe I'll start tonight
And do things right

You'll control me, oh, so boldly
Rule me 'til I'm free
The pain that shakes me finally makes me
Get up off of my knees
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Maybe I'll be fast as you
Maybe I'll break hearts too
But I think that you'll slow down
When your turn to hurt comes around

Maybe I'll break hearts
And be as fast as you, uh

You'll control me, oh, so boldly
Rule me 'til I'm free
The pain that shakes me finally makes me
Get up off of my knees

Maybe I'll be fast as you
Maybe I'll break hearts too
I think that you'll slow down
When your turn to hurt comes around

Maybe I'll break hearts
And be as fast as you
Maybe I'll break hearts
And be as fast as you

Oh, sookie

Maybe someday I'll be strong
Maybe it won't be long
I'll be the one who's strong
You'll be the one who's got it rough

You'll be the one who's got it rough
