Got a surprise especially for you
Something that both of us have always wanted to do
We've waited so long, waited so long
We've waited so long, waited so long

I'm gonna take you on a trip so far from here
I've got two tickets in my pocket, now baby, we're gonna disappear
We've waited so long, waited so long
We've waited so long, waited so long

I've got two tickets to paradise
Won't you pack your bags, we'll leave tonight
I've got two tickets to paradise
I've got two tickets to paradise

I'm gonna take you on a trip so far from here
I've got two tickets in my pocket, now baby, we're gonna disappear
We've waited so long, waited so long
We've waited so long, waited so long

I've got two tickets to paradise
Won't you pack your bags, we'll leave tonight
I've got two tickets to paradise
Won't you pack your bags, we'll leave tonight
I've got two tickets to paradise
Won't you pack your bags, we'll leave tonight
I've got two tickets to paradise
I've got two tickets to paradise
