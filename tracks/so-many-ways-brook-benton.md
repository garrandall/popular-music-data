Your lips on mine are soft as dew
Your kiss is so divine
Your eyes are like the skies of blue
And stars that brightly shine

Your voice is sweet like violins
And warm like summer days
I love you, I love you, I love you
In oh, oh, so many, many ways

Your touch is like a breath of spring
You give life to my soul
To me, sweetheart, you're everything
I ever hoped to hold

A smile from you lights up my heart
And brightens all my days
And I just love you, I love you, I love you
In oh, oh, so many, many ways

If words could say how much I care
My dear, you'd be amazed
That I love you, I love you, I love you
In oh, oh so many so many ways
