You know, I can't get no more
(Satisfaction)
Girl, you know you won't give me no more
(Inspiration)
Listen to me
Lord, have mercy!

You know that I lost that
(Lovin' Feelin')
But you don't see me
Packin' up my clothes
(Goin' and leavin')

(Woo-woo, woo-woo-woo)
It's better to have and don't need
Yes, better
(Than need and don't have)
(It's better to have and don't need)
Whoa, when you ain't got nobody
(Than need and don't have)
You know
(A man without a woman)
Yes, sho'
(Sho' gonna feel bad)

Girl, you caused me so much
(Pain and sorrow)
Well, listen
Havin' nobody, mama
(Is so much harder)
You better know it, yeah

Friends stopped by my house
(Instigate you)
But they don't know
It ain't gon' be no, yeah haha
(Separating)

(Woo-woo, woo-woo-woo)
(That's an almost)
It's better to have and don't need

Than need and don't have
(Almost gonna what?)
It's better to have and don't need
(Than need and don't have)
(A woman without a man)
(Sho' gonna be sad)

Yea-hey-hey

Oh!

Boogie!

My-my-my-my, clouds so dark
Have lost their silver linin'
But don't throw away
Your umbrella, ya'all
('Cause your sun is shining)

Oh, Lord!
I remember when your love, baby used to
(Keep me humming)
But I like the lyrics to your song
But I just can't feel
(Feel the music)
Oh!

(It's better to have and don't need)
(Than need and don't have)
(It's better to have and don't need
(Than need and don't have)
It's better (to have and don't need)
(Somebody's havin' nobody, to ha-ha-have)

Take-a a chance!

(It's better to have and don't need)
(And need and don't have)
No mo'
(It's better to have and don't need)
Ya'all
(Than need and don't have)

It's better, oh-oh
(To have and don't need)
(Than need and don't have)

(It's better to ha-ha-ha-haave
