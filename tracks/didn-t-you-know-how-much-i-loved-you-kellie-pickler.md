I remember the way you made love to me
Like I was all you'd ever need
Did you change your mind?
Well, I didn't change mine
Now here I am trying to make sense of it all
We were best friends, now we don't even talk
You broke my heart
Ripped my world apart


Didn't you know how much I loved you?
Didn't you know how much I loved you, baby?
I gave you everything, every part of me
Didn't you feel it when I touched you?
Didn't I rock you when I loved you, baby?
Baby, tell me
Didn't you know how much I loved you?


I can't get you out of my head
I still feel you in this bed
Left me all alone
You couldn't be more gone
From falling apart to fighting mad
From wanting you back to not giving a damn
I've felt it all
I've been to the wall


Didn't you know how much I loved you?
Didn't you know how much I loved you, baby?
I gave you everything, every part of me
Didn't you feel it when I touched you?
Didn't I rock you when I loved you, baby?
Baby, tell me
Didn't you know how much I loved you?


One day justice will come and find you
And I'll be right there in your memory to remind you


Didn't you know how much I loved you?
Didn't you know how much I loved you, baby?
I gave you everything, every part of me
Didn't you feel it when I touched you?
Didn't I rock you when I loved you, baby?
Baby, tell me
Didn't you know how much I loved you?
Didn't you know how much I loved you, baby?
I gave you everything, every part of me
Didn't you feel it when I touched you?
Didn't I rock you when I loved you, baby?
Baby, tell me
