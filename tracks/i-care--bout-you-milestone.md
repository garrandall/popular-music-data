Don't get it twisted it ain't much changed
Y'all already know, I ain't got say my name
I'm still a loose canon better watch for the bang
Bang, bang
I'm back on the road better stay out my lane (yeah)
Better tell somebody I don't fear nobody
I'm so much in my feelings like I don't hear nobody, you can't hold me down (hah)
No slack in it, Without further ado man I'm coming, you better get ready, I'm back with it

Back (on the) ground
Back (on the) ground
I'm back with it

Back (on the) ground
Back (on the) ground
I'm back with it

Back (on the) ground
Back (on the) ground
I'm back with it

Without further ado man I'm coming, you better get ready, I'm back with it

Back on the ground tell me, tell me, how that sound
Back on the ground tell me, tell me, how that sound
Back on the ground tell me, tell me, how that sound (yeah)
Without further ado man I'm coming, you better get ready, I'm back with it

Back on the field with the whole team
I'm purified all around like a gold ring
But Messing round try to gas me up
God'll air it all out
Catch me tipping like a slow leak
I talk about a lot for y'all to get to know me
A self righteous hypocrite is what I don't need
I can tell a hater really want attention but that kind of negativity around what I won't feed
It's the real that they can't take
I may never get ahead cause I can't fake it
I don't know 'bout this cannon cause he ain't safe
Co signing? I don't need it, its a rat race
And while they looking for the cheese, I'm looking for the cow
I'm working for tomorrow, they concerned for the now
I'm up 24 of em I'm tryna hit a milestone
At any opportune time till I catch a crown
It ain't a mechanism I can't cope
It ain't never been point of view that I can't scope
I can even understand when they can't get the jobs, the result is the young gotta move that dope
Drowning under water some can't even float
Tryna learn how to swim, why they riding on a boat?
They told me that I can be whatever I just wanna be the greatest but before I get ahead you should know:

Don't get it twisted it ain't much changed
Y'all already know, I ain't got say my name
I'm still a loose canon better watch for the bang
Bang, bang
I'm back on the road better stay out my lane (yeah)
(I'm back) T-t-tell somebody I don't fear nobody
I'm so much in my feelings like I don't hear nobody, you can't hold me down (hah)
No slack in it, Without further ado man I'm coming, you better get ready, I'm back with it

Back on the ground tell me, tell me, how that sound
Back on the ground tell me, tell me, how that sound
Back on the ground tell me, tell me, how that sound
Without further ado man I'm coming, you better get ready, I'm back with it

I'm back and I'm better it's a new day
A real man care about what the crew say
New changes I got a new lens with the way I see the world check me out with the new frames
Same car I just want to ride a new lane, I'm sick and tired getting passed what would you think
Man, sometimes you done took enough Ls
It would only make sense, start all over with a new game
And it's cool that they won't getcha
You can try to put my shoes on they won't fit ya
You may never open up until the son hit ya
I wouldn't listen if you had me on the phone wicha
And as I think about my life I gotta lead better, cause I ain't perfect I can flip at any time with it
Nowadays I ain't quick to buy what anybody selling if it ain't about progressing I ain't down with it, don't you come around with it
My feelings got so much to say
I'm not being controlled this ain't nothing to play
I am not a number, I am nothing for the records, try me, I ain't no one to break
Look around you do what ever it takes
Pyrexx said open the bible today
If you ain't trying push the pen or push a generation further get up out of my face

Back on the ground tell me, tell me, how that sound
Back on the ground tell me, tell me, how that sound
Back on the ground tell me, tell me, how that sound
Without further ado man I'm coming, you better get ready, I'm back with it

Don't get it twisted it ain't much changed
Ya'll already know, I ain't got say my name
I'm still a loose canon better watch for the bang
Bang, bang
I'm back on the road better stay out my lane (yeah)
T-t-tell somebody I don't fear nobody
I'm so much in my feelings like I don't hear nobody, you can't hold me down (hah)
No slack in it, Without further ado man I'm coming, you better get ready, I'm back with it (yea)

I'm back with it
I'm back with it (yeah)

Without further ado man I'm coming, you better get ready, I'm back with it
