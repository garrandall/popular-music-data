Sometimes I feel so alone
I call your heart, but there's no one at home
Taking a toll on my pride, pride
I'm reaching out, but there's no one inside


You know it doesn't feel right
When I look in your eyes
I know love is blind, but the heart doesn't lie
I'll ask one more time, maybe this time you'll try
So tell me girl, what's deep in your heart


Girl, I care about you
I'm there for you
So why don't you care for me like I care about you?
Girl, I care about you
I'm there for you
So why don't you care for me like I care about you?


I spend like all of my days, baby
Trying to suss out just how things got this way
I thought that we were in love
But I swear right now, I don't know what you want


I make sure that I give you quality time
But lately I feel you're not home by design
But still I'm gon' try to give you the love of my life
In hopes that you, that you will open up your heart


Girl, I care about you
I'm there for you
So why don't you care for me like I care about you?
Girl, I care about you
I'm there for you
So why don't you care for me like I care about you?


Sometimes (sometimes I'm not) I'm not sure that
(I'm all you've got) That I'm all you've got
(Sometimes I'm not) Sometimes I'm not sure if you love me or not, baby
Just one thing that I'm certain of
Girl I care for you
And the one thing that I want is that you care for me too


Girl, I care about you
I'm there for you
So why don't you care for me like I care about you?
Girl, I care about you
I'm there for you
So why don't you care for me like I care about you?

Girl, I care about you
I'm there for you
So why don't you care for me like I care about you?
Girl, I care about you
I'm there for you
So why don't you care for me like I care about you?
