And I can't do my dance 'cause my pants leather
They from France
I can't slow this
(I'm working on dying)
Yeah, no, I can't slow it
Fast paced all the time (Yeah, one, two, three, yeah)

Too much guap, bands, bands, bad lil' foreign, ten, ten
She ignore that man, fuckin' with me, handstand
I can't lie, she got that good, but that girl bad, bad
I stay with a bag, bag, make that girl dance, dance (Let's go, yeah)
Yeah, what is mine? That is yours
You can't hold my glam, yes, I own my glam
Stacking this paper, you know that I get it up
I can't be broke again
Talkin' that shit, then that Glocky gon' hit it up
Headshot soak his mans

My choppa get hot just like a pan
Knock your headlights just like a ram
I got ten toes and I count up, ten fingers
So I do not need an un-helping hand
Monopoly crib, I'm movin' again
Got your bitch on me, she groovin' again (Let's go)
Lamborghini just give them a reason to hate
So my niggas shootin' again
My coupe, my roof, drop that shit again
She sucked my dick then she mopped up my friend
No, we do not wanna feel tooth again
When she let me go, I'm on the loose again
She on the molly, she tryna boot again
She ain't even mine, this girl is a lend
I prayed every time when I thought you sinned
I write in my mind, I don't use a pen (Yeah, yeah)
She givin' me time, my watch cost a Lam'
Just give me more time, other watch cost a Benz (Yeah, yeah)
Look at Lil Uzi, he poppin' again
Them niggas, they switchin', they hoppin' again (Yeah)
Look at them niggas, they oppin' again
She give me that top and she sloppin' again (Woah)
Look at his album, it's floppin' again
Not takin' a brick, I'm not stoppin' again (Yeah, woah, yeah)

Too much guap, bands, bands, bad lil' foreign, ten, ten (Let's go)
She ignore that man, fuckin' with me, handstand (Let's go, let's go)
I can't lie, she got that good, but that girl bad, bad (Woah, woah)
I stay with a bag, bag, make that girl dance, dance (Let's go, yeah)
Yeah, what is mine? That is yours
You can't hold my glam, yes, I own my glam
Stackin' this paper, you know that I get it up
I can't be broke again
Talkin' that shit, then that Glocky gon' hit it up
Headshot soak his mans

Woah, spent a hundred thousand on a brand new pointer choker (Woah)
Automatic gun's got a motor
I can feel that shit in my shoulder (Woah)
Brand new watch cost a quarter
And you know it's flooded in water
You know every day I'm gettin' older
But I'm young enough for your daughter (Let's go)
And you know my neck is flooded in boulders (Boulders)
Gettin' money, yeah, that's my quota (Quota)
Even though Lil Uzi gettin' older (Older)
Know I'm young enough for your daughter (Yeah)
Everytime I'm in my mind, I focus (Woah)
She give me head, hypnosis (Yeah)
Talkin' 'bout the love can't hold me (Woah)
Talkin' 'bout the guap can't fold me
Uh, uh, talkin' 'bout "You're mine," no, you don't own me
Yeah, just take your time, and gotta be colder
Yeah, it's on my mind and they just know me (Know me)
Yeah, fast-paced all the time and I can't slow it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Too much guap, bands, bands, bad lil' foreign, ten, ten
She ignore that man, fuckin' with me, handstand
I can't lie, she got that good, but that girl bad, bad
I stay with a bag, bag, make that girl dance, dance (Let's go, yeah)
Yeah, what is mine? That is yours
You can't hold my glam, yes, I own my glam
Stacking this paper, you know that I get it up
I can't be broke again
Talkin' that shit, then that Glocky gon' hit it up
Headshot soak his mans (Lil Uzi)

Hello? Hello? Where am I?
I've never seen nothing like this, the fuck is all this?
Hello? Yo?
