Dream, dream lover
Dream, dream lover

Every night I hope and pray
A dream lover will come my way
A girl to hold in my arms
And know the magic of her charms
Because I want a girl to call my own

I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone

Dream lover, where are you
With a love, oh so true
And a hand that I can hold
To feel you near when I grow old
Because I want a girl to call my own

I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone

Someday, I don't know how
I hoe you'll hear my plea
Someway, I don't know how
She'll bring her love to me

Dream lover, until then
I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
Until my lover's dream comes true
Because I want a girl to call my own

I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone

Ooh, I got to hold on (someway)
But I don't know how, she'll bring her love to me
Her love to me

Dream lover, until then
I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
Until my lover's dream comes true
Because I want a girl to call my own

I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone
I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone
I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone

Dream, dream lover
Dream, dream lover

Dream, dream lover
Dream, dream lover
