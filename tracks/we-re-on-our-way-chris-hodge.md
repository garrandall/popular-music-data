Saucers are a-flyin'
Flyin' in the sky
The saucers are a-flyin'
Flyin', oh, so high

My woman's a sexy lady
She makes love like a dream
Burnin' like a fire, boy
Ever for eternity

We're on our way
We're on our way
We're on our way, we're on our way
We're on our way

Where she rides on ask a movie
A sparkle in the night
She shines in the sky like a blood of high
I mean, baby, it's a out of sight

Hurricanes, thunder
A spaceship's on the run
We're gonna bring the truth to planet earth
We're gonna move it on and on

We're on our way
We're on our way
We're on our way, we're on our way
We're on our way

Ahaha
