Coo coo u, I think coo coo, coo, coo coo, u. (Repeat)

How did you get so coo coo? How did you? (Repeat)

They say that it's a fact that your head is cracked. (Ya tambien somos locos.)
Well, I know it's true. You are coo coo, too. (Ya tambien somos locos.)
Once again I said you have lost your head. (Ya tambien somos locas.)
Since your ego's curbed, you are too disturbed. (Ya tambiem somos locas.)

How did you get so coo coo? How did you? (Repeat)

You are paranoid and your head is void. (Ya tambien somos locos.)
Since your wig is flipped your skull's come unzipped. (Ya tambien somos locos.)

How did you get so coo coo? How did you? (Repeat)
