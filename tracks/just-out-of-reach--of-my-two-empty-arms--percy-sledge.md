(Just out of reach
Of my two empty arms)

Love that runs away from me
Dreams that just won't let me be
Blues that keeps on bothering me
Chains that just won't set me free

Too far away from you
And all your charm
Just out of reach
Of my two empty arms

Each night in dreams
I see your face
Memories time cannot erase
Then I awake and find you're gone
Then I'm so blue and all alone

So far away from you
So sweet and warm
Just out of reach
Of my two empty arms

That lonesome feeling all the time
Knowing you could not be mine
Dreams that hurt me in my sleep
Vows that we could never, never keep

So far away from you
And all your charm
Just out of reach
Of my two empty arms
(Empty arms)
