Little boy, you probably don't know it
But on the night we met you stole my heart away
Little boy, can't help it if I show it
But I wish that you could love me too
Just as much as I love you
Yes, I know you would see that you were meant for me
Little boy, please let me be your little girl

Little boy, I hope you do believe me
'Cause it would break my heart if you should walk away
Little boy, just say you'll never leave me
And I'll give my heart and soul to you
Then you'll see our love is true
Yes, then I know you'll see how much you mean to me
Little boy, please let me be your little girl

I just want to go every place that you go
And do everything that you do
I just want to know everyone that you know
And spend my whole life loving you

Yes, then I know you'll see, just what you mean to me
Little boy please let me be your little girl
Little boy, little boy... (repeat and fade)
