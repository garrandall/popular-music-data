Shake!
(Everybody say it!) Shake!
(Early in the morning) Shake!
(Late in the evening) Shake!
(In the midnight hour) Shake!
(When the time's going bad, now) Shake!
Shake with the FEELING!
Shake with the FEELING!

Listen while I'm talkin' to you now
Tell you what I'm gonna do now
There's a new thing going around now
I'll tell what to put down now

You move your body all around
And just shake
Thats the way you do it Shake, Shake, Shake it baby
Shake it like a bowl of soup
Let your body loop de loop
Put your hands on your hip
Come on and let your backbone slip
Move your body like your hip
And just shake!

Shake early in the morning
Shake early in the evening

A Ring-A-Ling-a-Ling
Honey, Shakin' is the greatest thing
But if you really roll Gotta do the thing with SOUL!

Shake shake with all your might now
If you do it, do it right now
Put your hands on your hip,yeah
Come on and let your backbone slip
Move your body like your hip
And just shake

(God have mercy now!)
Early in the morning
Early in the evening All night long, y'all!
If you really want to roll
Gotta do the thing with SOUL!
Shake shake with all your might
If you do it, do it right
Let your body loop de lite
Shake!
Everybody say it, Shake!
One more time, Shake!
Everybody louder, Shake!
One more time, now, say Shake!
Everybody a bit louder, Shake!
