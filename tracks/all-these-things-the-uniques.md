The touch of your lips next to mine
Gets me excited, makes me feel fine
I've got it bad but that's all right
Long as you're near me every night
Your love so warm and tender
Your thrill is so divine
It is all these things that make you mine

If you would leave me, I surely would die
When you started to go, I started to cry
I've got it bad but that's all right
Long as you're near me every night
Your love so warm and tender
Your thrill is so divine
It is all these things that make you mine

If you would leave me, I surely would die
When you started to go, I started to cry
I've got it bad but that's all right
Long as you're near me every night
Your love so warm and tender
Your thrill is so divine
It is all these things that make you mine
