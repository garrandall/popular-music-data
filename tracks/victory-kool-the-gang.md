People get ready it's time to show
What you got
Players take your place it's only
One way to the top
You must feel the victory release that
Energy and ride like the wind
With fire in your eyes shake those
Butterflies and do the best you can
Victory Victory let the party begin
Victory victory let's do it again

You are the best, you seem to stand
Out from the rest
Your intentions to be more than a honorable mention
You must feel that victory, release that
Energy and ride like the wind
Fire in your eyes shake those
Butterflies, go ahead and go
For the win now
Victory victory let the party begin
Victory victory everybody can win

'Cause it's the same way in life
Same way in life
Inside the tunnel see the light
- See the light
The perfect balance you must find
It's the same way in life
Victory victory victory

Victory-sweet-oo-victory-sweet
Victory-sweet-can you feel It?
Victory sweet, so sweet, so sweet

There's only one way to the top if You really want it
You can never stop pushin' for the
Victory-go ahead
Players take your places-go ahead
Feel that victory release that energy
So sweet to the top-go ahead, go ahead

Players take your places to the top Victory
