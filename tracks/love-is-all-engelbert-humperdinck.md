Yesterday, I knew the games to play
I thought I knew the way life was meant to be
But now there's you, my foolish games are through
Now at last I have found just what makes
This whole world turn around

Love is all I have to give
Love is all as long as I shall live
So take it all and I'll always be there
When you call my name
I know, know that love is all

Every night I longed to hold you tight
Until the morning light shines in your eyes
So love me now, we'll get along some how
Won't you please take my hand?
And together, forever we'll stay

Love is all I have to give
Love is all as long as I shall live
So take it all and I'll always be there
When you call my name
I know, know that love is all
