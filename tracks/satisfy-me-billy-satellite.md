Baby, when you gonna satisfy me
Baby, when you gonna satisfy me

I been lonely so long
Don't know why
Comes to loving you
Just get by

Sometimes love
Is a real good thing
But tell me, girl
Where you been



Well, you're the only girl
That I wanna love
But the closer I get
Seems the less we touch

I don't know
Why you move so fast
But a man like me
Could make it last



Just how long can I
Keep going strong
Loving you hurts so much
I've gotta get out of here

And when I'm gone
(Leaving Sunday)
Someone who's not as strong
(By Monday)

Might take your world from me
(On Tuesday)
You, you'll think about me

Where you been hiding out
You got me worried
You're gonna jump and shout

Baby, when you gonna satisfy me
(When you gonna satisfy me, yeah)
Baby, when you gonna satisfy me
(When you gonna satisfy me, yeah)

Baby, when you gonna satisfy me
(When you gonna, when you gonna)
(Let me know)
Baby, when you gonna satisfy me

Baby, when you gonna satisfy me
(When you gonna, when you gonna)
(Let me know)
Baby, when you gonna satisfy me
(When you gonna satisfy me)

Baby, when you gonna satisfy me...
