Oh, no, no, no


Hope life's been good to you
Since you've been gone
I'm doing fine now — I've finally moved on
It's not so bad — I'm not that sad
I'm not surprised just how well I survived
I'm over the worst, and I feel so alive
I can't complain — I'm free again


And it only hurts when I'm breathing
My heart only breaks when it's beating
My dreams only die when I'm dreaming
So, I hold my breath — to forget


Don't think I'm lyin' 'round, cryin' at night
There's no need to worry, I'm really alright
I've never looked back — as a matter of fact


And it only hurts when I'm breathing
My heart only breaks when it's beating
My dreams only die when I'm dreaming
So, I hold my breath — to forget


It only hurts when I breathe
Mmm, no, I've never looked back
As a matter of fact


And it only hurts when I'm breathing
My heart only breaks when it's beating
My dreams only die when I'm dreaming
So, I hold my breath — to forget


Hurts when I'm breathing
Breaks when it's beating
Die when I'm dreaming
It only hurts when I breathe
