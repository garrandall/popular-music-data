Hear that whistle its 10 o'clock
(Don't let go)
(Don't let go)
Come on baby it's time to rock
(Don't let go)
(Don't let go)
I'm so glad I've got you here
(Don't let go)
(Don't let go)
Keeps me grinnin' from ear to ear
(Don't let go)
(Don't let go)

Oo-ee, mmm this feelin' is killin' me
Aaaw shucks
Well, I wouldn't stop for a million bucks
(I love you so)
Just hold me tight and don't let go

Thunder, lightnin', wind and rain
(Don't let go)
(Don't let go)
Love is formin' inside my brain
(Don't let go)
(Don't let go)
I'm so eager I'm nearly dyin'
(Don't let go)
(Don't let go)
You've been keepin' your lips from mine
(Don't let go)
(Don't let go)

Oo-ee, mmm this feelin' is killin' me
Aaaw shucks
Well, I wouldn't stop for a million bucks
(I love you so)
Just hold me tight and don't let go, yeah
Whooooa, yeah
Don't let go
Come on and kiss me, kiss me sweet
Hold me tight baby and don't let go
(Don't let go)
Come on and love me
You've gotta love me
(Don't let go)
I want ya, I want ya, I really, really want ya
(Don't let go)
All night, feels so right
(Don't let go)
Hold me tight, don't let go

Hound dogs barkin' upside the hill
(Don't let go)
(Don't let go)
Love is draggin' him through the mill
(Don't let go)
(Don't let go)
If it wasn't for havin' you, girl
(Don't let go)
(Don't let go)
I'd be a-howlin' and a-barkin' too
(Don't let go)
(Don't let go)

Oh-ee, mmm this feelin' is killin' me
Aaaw shucks
Well, I wouldn't stop for a million bucks
(I love you so)
Just hold me tight and don't let go, no
No, no don't let go
I need ya so, girl
Hold me, momma
(Hold me tight if it takes all night)
(But don't let go)
Don't, don't let me go
(I wouldn't stop for a million bucks)
('Cause I love you so)
No, no, no I love you so, yeah
