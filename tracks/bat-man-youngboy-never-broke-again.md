Mm, Statik On The Track (David Tell Em)

Big gat, I got all this money in my pants, talkin' big stacks
Had to tell that bitch to watch her hands, push yo' shit back
I be walking with that thirty in my pants, you can't miss that
I know you see the way these diamonds dance

Crack the seal on that dope and pour a four up
You got the opp, I got the Backwood, get you rolled up
And life cold, my nigga died, think that it's colder
Swerve on a nigga ass, aim with the strap, watch how he fold up
Bitch, you ain't gon' fold nothin', one thing you know is up with me
I got nothin' but killers on the line and they all stuck with me
Fuck the money, bro, them clutch that iron and they gon' bust for me
Run up, that's when all you niggas dyin', you think 'bout touching me
These niggas shootin' shit luckily
Bitch, this ain't no luck, nigga, we get close, bust the fire
No shooting from a distance, we gon' zip 'em, you just pull on side
This cutter hit 'em, flip 'em, Draco split 'em and they don't walk outside
Talk like you official, we gon' blitz him, buried while alive

Pull up in that Rolls, I look like Batman
I'm cold right now, man, where the heater? Nigga, fuck the fan
I think I'm James Brown or Elvis how these diamonds dance
These niggas roll down, we spinnin', finna bust his ass

Big gat, I got all this money in my pants, talkin' big stacks
Had to tell that bitch to watch her hands, push yo' shit back
I be walking with that thirty in my pants, you can't miss that
I know you see the way these diamonds dance

Man, look, he said he gon' step on who? I'm gon' put him on the news
I just hit an opp with the stick like I'm playing pool
Hundred shots, a hundred fools, 4KTrey break all the rules
Die today if we see you, stretch 'em and watch how I move
Bitches tryna Youngboy walk, niggas tryna baller-block
Come see what I got in this car, before I shoot, I shorten the stock
Big thirty-eight, I beat a opp, big four-five and it's made by Glock
Hop out the car and escape from the cops
Spray it with the K and we tearing up the block

Pull up in that Rolls, I look like Batman
I'm cold right now, man, where the heater? Nigga, fuck the fan
I think I'm James Brown or Elvis how these diamonds dance
These niggas roll down, we spinnin', finna bust his ass

Big gat, I got all this money in my pants, talkin' big stacks
Had to tell that bitch to watch her hands, push yo' shit back
I be walking with that thirty in my pants, you can't miss that
I know you see the way these diamonds dance

Man, look, he said he gon' step on who? I'm gon' put him on the news
I just hit an opp with the stick like I'm playing pool
