It must have broke your poor little heart
When the boys used to say
You looked better in the dark
Ooh but now they'd give all they learnt in school
To be somewhere in the dark with you
(Oh yes they would)

You know the teacher would ask the questions
And you, would always raise your hand
Ooh but somehow you never got your turn
And my eyes would fill with water, inside I'd burn
(Oh yes I did)

Homely girl, she was so lonely
You're a beautiful woman oh yes lonely girl
Homely girl you used to be lonely
You're a beautiful woman oh yeah

There was a boy who used to sit beside you
Who'd like to hold that place his whole life through
Ooh you were beautiful to me
You had a heart no one could ever see, oh yes you did

I was the only one who offered
To carry your books
Took all the stares and laughter
With the dirty looks
But I saw then what they see now
They all want to ask you for a date
They don't know how, they don't know how

Homely girl, she was so lonely
You're a beautiful woman oh yes lonely girl
Homely girl you used to be lonely
You're a beautiful woman oh yeah

Ooh first they want a chance to hold you
Then they want a chance to try to control you
Oh no, don't you know I got to say it
