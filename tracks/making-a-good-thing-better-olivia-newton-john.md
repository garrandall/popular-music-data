Although I know our love is going strong
Little surprises kind of help it along
We mustn't let our lives become routine
Don't do anything we don't mean

There is no limit on love at all
It can always get better the deeper you fall
I'm sure without that love we won't survive
So come on and show it; let's keep it alive

And we'll be making a good thing better
But with luck it's gonna last forever
You'll see
Making a good thing better
That's the way we're gonna stay together
You and me

If we're to make each other satisfied
Gotta keep on tryin'; don't let it ride
It all comes over in the morning kiss
Don't do it like that; do it like this

Making a good thing better
But with luck it's gonna last forever
You'll see
Making a good thing better
That's the way we're gonna stay together
You and me

Make it so much better
It is better better
Make it so much better
Make it better better
Make it better better better
Make it better better better
Make it better better better
Better better

Making a good thing better
But with luck it's gonna last forever
You'll see
Making a good thing better
That's the way we're gonna stay together
You and me
