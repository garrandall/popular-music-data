I've got my angel on my mind that's why I'm walkin'
There's such an ache in this old heart now I ain't talkin'
The little hand that held mine tight just waved goodbye tonight
I've got her sweet love on my mind that's why I'm walkin'
With an old love on your mind life's not worth livin'
I breathe her name with every breath I'm breathin'
Why could I never see how much she meant to me
I've got her sweet love on my mind that's why I'm walkin'

With an old love on your mind...
I've got my angel on my mind that's why I'm walkin'
