When I'm all through if I haven't been what they think I should be
If the total isn't high enough when they figure me
When I grow old if there's no gray from worry in my hair
What do I care? What do I care?


What do I care just as long as you were mine a little while?
When the road was long and weary you gave me a few good mile
What do I care if I miss a goal because I make a slip?
I'll still be satisfied because I tasted your sweet lips


What do I care if I never have much money?
And sometimes my table looks a little bare
Anything that I may miss is made up for each time we kiss
You love me and I love you, so what do I care?




What do I care if I never have much money?
And sometimes my table looks a little bare
Anything that I may miss is made up for each time we kiss
You love me and I love you, so what do I care?
