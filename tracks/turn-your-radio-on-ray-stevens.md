Welcome and listen into a radio station
Where the mighty hosts of heaven sing
Turn your radio on - turn your radio
Turn your radio on - turn your radio on
If you wanna feel those good vibrations
Coming from the joy that His love can bring
Turn your radio on - turn your radio on
Turn your radio on

Turn your radio on - oh yes, turn your radio on
And listen to the music in the air - and listen to the music in the air
Turn your radio on - oh yes, turn your radio on
And glory share - and glory, glory share
Turn your lights down low - oh yes, turn your lights down low
And listen to the master's radio - and listen to the master's radio
Get in touch with God - get in touch with God
Turn your radio on - turn your radio on

A don't you know that everybody is a radio receiver
All you gotta do is listen for the call
Turn your radio on - turn your radio
Turn your radio on - turn your radio on
If you listen in you will be a believer
Leanin' on the truth that will never fall
Get in touch with God - get in touch with God
Turn your radio on 

Turn your radio on - oh yes, turn your radio on
And listen to the music in the air - and listen to the music in the air
Turn your radio on - oh yes, turn your radio on
And glory share - and glory, glory share
Turn your lights down low - oh yes, turn your lights down low
And listen to the master's radio - and listen to the master's 
Turn your lights down low and listen to the master's radio
Get in touch with God - get in touch with God
Turn your radio on - turn your radio on
