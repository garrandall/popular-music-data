It's been so long since I've seen you, come over darlin'
It's been so long since I've seen you, come over darlin'
Make me feel good once again
Oh, turn me on, my friend

It's been so long since I've seen you, come over darlin'
It's been so long since I've seen you, come over darlin'
I wanna see your smile, child
It's only for a little while, child

It's been so long since I've seen you, come over darlin'
It's been so long since I've seen you, come over darlin'

It's been so long
So long
Come over darlin', baby, honey, yeah
