DJ Khaled,
We the best season
Has returned
I do this
For the streets
The runners

Cause I'm out here grindin'
Cause I'm out here grindin'
Hey Hey
I don't care what nobody say
Ima be me (be me)
Stay hood
Stay rasied in the streets
(cause I'm out here grindin')
niggas talk about greatness
Whenever they speak about me
(Cause I'm out here grindin')
I ain't splitting
Nothing with nobody homie
I gotta get me me
(cause I'm out here grindin')
I ain't slept in 8 days
I can go for 8 weeks
Ain't nothing to me
Cause I am the streets.


Ricky Ross
Put my life on the line
But I'm likely to rhyme
I'm on top of the game
If you like it or not
Ask how I get freesh
Strawberry swishy sweets
You'll be dealing with H
When you dealing with G's
Flashing deal
With the realest
Shopping like
It's still december
Diplomat on the fender
Of the phantom
I'm the winner
I do it for the hood
I do it cause you're gay
You suckers
Wish you could Ricky Ross
Is in the bank


Hey, feds
Heard your bringing
My name up
Know you want me back
Think I give a fuck
Better dyte me now
Before price go up
Came in the world thuggin
Leaving with big nuts
Yeah, I run with killas
Homie so what
What you want me to tell
I sold you to lil dust?
Send your informants
I bet he leave butts
Ain't scared to go
I beileve in jesus


I don't care what nobody say
Ima be me (be me)
Stay hood
Stay rasied in the streets
(cause I'm out here grindin')
niggas talk about greatness
Whenever they speak about me
(Cause I'm out here grindin')
I ain't splitting
Nothing with nobody homie
I gotta get me me.
(cause I'm out here grindin')
I ain't slept in 8 days
I can go for 8 weeks
Ain't nothing to me
Cause I am the streets


W E T H E B E S T
DJ Khaled (WE DA BEST)
W E T H E B E S T
(DJ Khaled) That's ME!
W E T H E B E S T
DJ Khaled (WE DA BEST)
W E T H E B E S T
(DJ Khaled)
That's me
I wake up
To get my cake up
I'm algie brown
What can I say
I'm a product
Of my environment
Uh oh, I'm in the game
Watch me do me
Kickin these niggas
Khaled man
Call that bruce lee
Summer winter spring
I can't forget the fall
I still remain a dog
A diabetic and all
All I want is my paper
I don't care what they say
They stick their tounge out
When they bow their head
(Cause we da best)


You niggas fly
Before you were just maggots
I'm the shit bitch
Because I'm black flagging
Yes sir DR the new sqaud
You niggas soft
We go hard
They like
Oh, God there go t double
He got his click
And his brothers
I know it's gon be trouble
Dark boys on the black gas
See they don't black mask
Now they can stand
My black ass


I don't care what nobody say
Ima be me (be me)
Stay hood
Stay rasied in the streets
(cause I'm out here grindin')
Talking about greatness
Whenever they speak about me
(Cause I'm out here grindin')
I ain't spitting
Nothing with nobody homie
I gotta gimme me
(cause I'm out here grindin')
I ain't slipping 8 days
I can go for 8 weeks
Ain't nothing to me
Cause I am the streets


Hey knock knock
Yee I'm knocking on
The Bank's door
Gimme the million dollars
And I'm dropping off
The cash flow
See you ain't heard
I hit a nit
Now my money right
Spend it on the u-haul
Dippin' on the turn pipe
Call up my dogs
Brag up my face
Bodies gon fall
Tell em it's ace
If I catch a charge
I'm gon flee the state
My nigga's
LA Reid and Khaled
Watch me beat the case


Hahhhaha
And we are the best
And weezy be the shhh
Like two H's after S
I got these niggas on shhh
Like I gon deaf
And I'm right right
And your wrong left
Hahahahaha
Check out this bizarre
I am regularly irregular
Khaled best DJ
Weezy best rapper
If Khaled say
It's a movie
Then weezy best actor


I don't care what nobody say
Ima be me (be me)
Stay hood stay
Rasied on the streets
(Cause I'm out here grindin')
Talking about greatness
Whenever they speak about me
(Cause I'm out here grindin')
I ain't splitting
Nothing with nobody
Homie I gotta gimme me
(Cause I'm out here grindin')
I ain't slipping 8 days
I can go for 8 weeks
Ain't nothing to me Cause I am the streets
