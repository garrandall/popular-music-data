Oh, you know I did it, it's over and I feel fine
Nothing you could say is gonna change my mind
Waited and I waited the longest night
Nothing like the taste of sweet decline

I went down, I fell, I fell so fast
Dropping like the grains in an hourglass
Never say forever 'cause nothing last
Dancing with the bones of my buried past

Nevermind. There's nothing I can do
Bet your life there's something killing you

It's a shame we have to die, my dear
No one's getting out of here
Alive
This time

What a way to go, but have no fear
No one's getting out of here
Alive
This time

I'm finished, I'm getting you off my chest
Made you come clean in a dirty dress
A promise is a promise you kept in check
Hard to cross a heart that beats its best

Take a good hard look for the very last time
The very last one in a very long line
Only took a second to say "goodbye"
Been a pleasure but the pleasure's been mine, all mine

Nevermind. There's nothing I can do
Bet your life there's something killing you

It's a shame we have to die, my dear
No one's getting out of here
Alive
This time

What a way to go, but have no fear
No one's getting out of here
Alive
This time

Ain't no way
DOA
Ain't no way
DOA

Take a good hard look for the very last time
The very last one in a very long line
Only took a second to say "goodbye"
Been a pleasure but the pleasure's been mine, all mine

Nevermind. There's nothing I can do
Bet your life there's something killing you

It's a shame we have to die, my dear
No one's getting out of here
Alive
This time

What a way to go, but have no fear
No one's getting out of here
Alive
This time

It's a shame we have to disappear
No one's getting out of here
Alive
This time
This time
This time
