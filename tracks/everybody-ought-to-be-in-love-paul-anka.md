(CHORUS)
Everybody ought to be in love
Everybody ought to have somebody
Everybody ought to be in love
Everybody ought to have somebody

Empty rooms behind me
No more nights alone
A table and some chairs for two

Now the world will find me
With someone of my own
The loneliness at last
Is through

If everyone had
Someone just like you
Then everyone would
Feel the way I do

(CHORUS)

Imagine having someone
Always by your side
A bed for one can be so cold
Someone you can talk to
When your hands are tied
Someone there to have and hold

There's nothing more
Rewarding to pursue
(When you're in love and you hear)
Hearing someone saying
I love you (I love you)

(CHORUS) 3X to fade
