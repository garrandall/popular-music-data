I was hanging with some friends of mine
We were out having a real good time, yeah
I saw a girl who was so very fine
I started waving my hands, my arms, my head
Got the nerve; found the words to say, yeah
But to my surprise, she was passing
I mean, it was strange 'cause she just walked away
She won't talk to me, she won't talk to me

Now you're nervous with the fever
Body heat to never quit
I'm in heaven when I see her
Hope she talks a little bit, a little bit
(What'cha gonna do?)
You can't sit there all night, no honey, all by yourself
(I just wanna talk to you) And nobody else, yeah


I just wanna tell her
She's the girl of my fantasy
How we meet in my dreams every night it seems
And how love can be, I wanna (love you)
I'm gonna be (your love)
It's not everyday you see the one
That your heart's been nightly dreaming of
There's that look in her eyes, so I don't know why
She won't talk to me, she won't talk to me

She pretends she doesn't see me
Leaves me standing in the rain
'Cause I know she wants to meet me (I know, I know)
She's just playing silly games
(What'cha gonna do?)
Wanna show you a love that you just, you gotta see
(I just wanna talk to you) But she won't talk to me


And oh I'm telling everyone
I'm not dreaming anymore
'Cause I know she won't talk to me now
And at least she can't say no


And I'm going crazy, yeah
Trying to make her notice me
I go up, I get down, I turn all around
She won't talk to me, she won't talk to me


I said (Hey there, baby)
(Hey there, girl)
I said (Hey there, baby)
But she won't talk to me
She won't talk to me
I said (Hey there, baby)
I said (Hey there, girl)
(Hey there, baby)
But she won't talk to me
She won't talk to me
(Hey there, baby)
(Hey there, girl)
(Hey there, baby)
She won't talk to me
She won't talk to me
And then I tried (Hey there, baby)
And then I said (Hey there, girl)
I said (Hey there, baby)
She won't talk to me, talk to me
(Hey there, baby)
(Hey there, girl)
(Hey there, baby)
