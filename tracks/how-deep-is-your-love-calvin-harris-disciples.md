I want you to breathe me
Let me be your air
Let me roam your body freely
No inhibition, no fear
Open up my eyes and
Tell me who I am
Let me in on all your secrets
No inhibition, no sin

How deep is your love?
Like the ocean?
What devotion are you?
How deep is your love?
Like nirvana?
Hit me harder
Again
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?

What if you could breathe me?
I could be your air
I would own your body freely
No inhibition, no fear
Open up my mind, and
Tell me who I am
There will be no secrets
No inhibition, no sin

How deep is your love?
Like the ocean?
What devotion are you?
How deep is your love?
Like nirvana?
Hit me harder
Again

How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?

I want you to breathe me, let me be your air
I want you to breathe me, let me be your air
I want you to breathe me, let me be your air
I want you to breathe me

I want you to breathe me, let me be your air
I want you to breathe me, let me be your air
I want you to breathe me, let me be your air
I want you to breathe me
