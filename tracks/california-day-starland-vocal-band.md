To be blessed with forgetfulness
Oh yes
To be glad to be alive
Like a bee out of the hive
I don't know how I have survived
But here I am (Here I am)
It's a California day (California day)
California weather (California weather)
Take the clouds away (take the clouds away)
I feel a whole lot better
California day
There's nothing like the sunshine
To get me out of doors
And I'd paddle you in my canoe
If I could find some oars
Good-bye big time
Hello windchimes
Yea esprit d'corp
It's a California Day (California day)
California weather (California weather)
Take the clouds away (take the clouds away)
I feel a whole lot better
California day
I ran into an old dream I remember well (I remember well)
It used to be a daydream
Now it's beginning to feel so real
California Day
California weather
Take the clouds away
I feel a whole lot better
California
California day
California weather
Take the clouds away
I feel a whole lot better
California day
To be blessed with forgetfulness
Woh yes
To be glad to be alive
Like a bee out of the hive
I don't know how I have survived
But here I am (Oh here I am)
Blown away and gone again
Blown away and gone again
Blown away and gone again
Blown away and gone again
