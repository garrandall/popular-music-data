She may be the face I canâ€™t forget


The first time I saw lightning strike
I saw it underground
Six deep feet below the street
The sky came crashing down
For a second, that place was lost in space
Then everything went black
I left that basement burning
And I never went back


The second time I saw it strike
I saw it at sea
It lit up the fish like rain
And rained them down on me
For a second, that boat was still afloat
Then everything went black
I left it underwater
And I never went back


Hey, hey, hey!
But I like it when that lightning comes
Hey, hey, hey!
Yes, I like it a lot
Hey, hey, hey!
Yes, I'm jumping like a jumping jack
Dancing, screaming, itching, squealing, fevered
Feeling hot, hot, hot!


The third time I saw lightning strike
It hit me in bed
It threw me around
And left me for dead
For a second, that room was on the moon
Then everything went black
I left that house on fire
And I never went back
