Sittin' in the morning sun
I'll be sittin' when the evening come
Watching ships roll in
And I'll watch 'em roll away again

Lord, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wasting time

I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the Frisco bay
I have nothing to live for
Looks like nothings gonna come my way

So I'm gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away, ooh Lord
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wasting time, oh

Look like nothings gonna change
Every, everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, yeah

Sittin' here resting my bones
This loneliness won't leave me alone, no
Two thousand miles I roam
Just to make this dock my home

Now, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away, yeah
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wasting time, oh yeah

Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wasting time, time, time, oh
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wasting time, time, time

Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wasting time, time, time
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wasting time, time, time, oh

Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wasting time, time, time
