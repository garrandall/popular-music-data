He's in town
(He's in town)
He's back in town
(He's in town)

Girl, I knew just what was wrong
(He's in town)
When you weren't home
Each time when I phoned
All week long

And now I see it in your eyes
(He's in town)
The look on your face
When you're thinking of him
Can't be disguised

I was afraid
He'd come back someday
And I'd be the one to lose
I knew when you saw him
You wouldn't ignore him
And he'd be the one you choose

No, you don't have to tell me
He's in town
(He's in town)
He's back in town
(He's in town)

No, you don't have to tell me
He's in town
(he's in town)
He's back in town

(He's in town)
He's in town
(He's in town)
(He's in town)
