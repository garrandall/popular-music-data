Bring a little sunshine to my heart
Just before you say goodbye
Make me smile for just awhile
Before you make me cry

Bring a little sunshine to my heart
With a little kiss or two
Hold me tight with all your might
Before you make me blue

Make believe for one sweet moment
Things are still the same
Just the warmth of one carress
Will help to ease my pain

Bring a little sunshine to my heart
Darling, if you do, I pray
The feeling of my tender love
Will make you change your mind and stay

Just the warmth of one carress
Will help to ease my pain

Bring a little sunshine to my heart
Darling, if you do, I pray
The feeling of my tender love
Will make you change your mind and stay
