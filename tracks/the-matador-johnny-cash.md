The crowd is waiting for the bullfight
Matador
My final fight the place is packed once more
Anita won't throw me a rose this fight
The one she wears is not for me tonight

She's watching now with her new love I know
Walk proud and slow
Be strong and sure give the crowd their show
They want blood you know!
You're still their idol as you were before
Kill just one more!
Remind Anita, you're the greatest Matador

Walk on out, forget Anita in the stands
Be a tall and brave and noble man
Be better than you've ever been before
Make this you're greatest moment Matador

She's watching now with her new love I know
Walk proud and slow
Be strong and sure give the crowd a show
They want blood you know!
You're still their idol as you were before
Kill just one more!
Remind Anita, you're the greatest Matador
