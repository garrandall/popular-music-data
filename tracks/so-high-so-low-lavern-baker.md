You must come into my heart
I'm begging
You must come into my heart
I'm pleading
You must come into my heart
I'm asking
You must come into my heart

My love is so high
You can't get over it
So low, you can't get under it
So wide, you can't get around it
You must come into my heart

So high, you can't get over it
So low, you can't get under it
So wide, you can't get around it
You must come into my heart

Don't you know it's so high
And my love is so low
I'm telling you, so wide
Yeah, you must come into my heart

Some people, they travel by water
Some people, they travel by land
If you want to be my honey
You must go hand in hand

Don't you know it's so high
And I'm telling you it's so low
Whoa, oh, so wide
Whoa, you must come into my heart

My love is so high
And it's so low, so wide
You must come into my heart
You must come into my heart
One more time
You must come into my heart
My heart is yours
