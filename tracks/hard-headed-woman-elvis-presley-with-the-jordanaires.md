Well a hard headed woman
A soft hearted man
Been the cause of trouble
Ever since the world began

Oh yeah, ever since the world began
A hard headed woman been
A thorn in the side of man

Adam told to Eve
Listen here to me
Don't you let me catch you
Messin' round that apple tree

Oh yeah, ever since the world began
A hard headed woman been
A thorn in the side of man

Oh yeah, ever since the world began
A hard headed woman been
A thorn in the side of man

Samson told Delilah
Loud and clear
Keep your cotton pickin' fingers
Out my curly hair

Oh yeah, ever since the world began
A hard headed woman been
A thorn in the side of man

I heard about a king
Who was doing swell
Till he started playing
With that evil Jezebel

Oh yeah, ever since the world began
A hard headed woman been
A thorn in the side of man

I got a woman
A head like a rock
If she ever went away
I'd cry around the clock

Oh yeah, ever since the world began
A hard headed woman been
A thorn in the side of man

A hard headed woman been
A thorn in the side of man
