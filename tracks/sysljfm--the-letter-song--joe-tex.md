Everybody has got somebody
Yes, they do
Alright
An everybody's got their own way
Of sayin', I love you
Oh, yes they have

The sooner you say it
The better it is
The softer you whisper it
The better it feels
Just make sure
That when you say it
Be for real

Alright, let me hear you say it, now

S.y.s.l.j.f.m
Save your sweet love just for me
D.k.w.i.m.t.m
You don't know what it means to me
D.e.t.y.s.l.a
Don't ever take your sweet love away
I.c.l.m.l.t.w
I can't live my life that way
(Woo-ooo!)
Alright

'Tell them'

'Oh, if gramma could see me now'

'H'uh, H'uh, get on up there, now!'

'Keep that beat goin'

Alright

'I love this song, now listen'

Everybody, s'got somebody
They love to talk about
And I've got somebody

Everybody, got their own way
Of unwindin' when they feel
Down and out
Oh yes, they have

The sooner you unwind
The better it is
The easiest way you do it
The better you feel

Just make sure
That when you do it
Be for real

Alright!

Listen!

Y.c.c. m.a.o.t
You can call me any old time
Alright
T.c.a.h.y.t.u
To come and help you to unwind

S.y.s.l.j.f.m
Save your sweet love just for me
D.k.w.i.m.t.m
Don't know what I means to me
Yeah!
D.e.t.y.s.l.a
Don't ever take your sweet love away
I.c.l.m.l.t.w

I can't live my life that way
