This is insane
All you did was say hello
Speak my name
Feeling your love
Like a love I used to know
Long ago
How can it be?
We're a different space in time
Come to me
Feel like I'm home
In a place I used to know
Long ago
Deja Vu
Could you be the dream that I once knew?
Is it you?
Deja Vu
Could you be the dream that might come true?
Shining through
I keep remembering me
I keep remembering you
Deja Vu

This is devine
I been waiting all my life
Filling time
Looking for you
That's worth more than you could know
Long ago
Come to me now
We don't have to dream of love
We know how
Somewhere before
It's as if I loved you so
So long ago
Deja Vu
Could you be the dream that I once knew?
Is it you?
Deja Vu
Could you be the dream that might come true?
Shining through
I keep remembering me
I keep remembering you
Deja Vu
Deja Vu
Deja Vu
Deja Vu
Deja Vu
Could you be the dream that I once knew?
Is it you?
Deja Vu
Could you be the dream that might come true?
Shining through
I keep remembering me
I keep remembering you
Deja Vu
Deja Vu
Could you be the dream that I once knew?
Is it you?
Deja Vu
Could you be the dream that might come true?
Shining through
