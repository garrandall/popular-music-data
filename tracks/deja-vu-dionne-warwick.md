DÃ©jÃ  vu
DÃ©jÃ  vu
DÃ©jÃ  vu
DÃ©jÃ  vu

This is insane
All you did was say hello
Speak my name
Feeling your love
Like a love I used to know
Long ago
How can this be
You're a different space in time
Come to me
I feel like I'm home
In a place I used to know
So long ago

They call it dÃ©jÃ  vu (dÃ©jÃ  vu, dÃ©jÃ  vu, dÃ©jÃ  vu)
Could you be the dream that I once knew?
(Could you be the dream that I once knew, knew?)
Is it you?
(Feel like real life, could this be you, you?)
DÃ©jÃ  vu (dÃ©jÃ  vu, dÃ©jÃ  vu, dÃ©jÃ  vu)
Could you be the dream that might come true?
(Could you be the dream that might come true, true?)
Shining through
(Could it really be you that's shining through, through?)
I keep remembering me
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
I keep remembering you
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
DÃ©jÃ  vu (DÃ©jÃ  vu)

I get to drinking and I get to digging
A similar 
Like baby we both been here before
 we can ignore
I know you for sure
But only know you from the door
But we can go explore
I think I knew right away
We can ride a wave
Go deep in the mental dimension
With none of the haters I've mentioned
We won't even notice they're missing
Can't take 
The only way they 
The life that we living
Sometimes we forget that we living, so I gotta fill it
I gotta  the vision is vivid
 never predicted
We stay at attention, they look at us different
They don't get it, they don't get it

I say sure, you do you, I do me
My whole vibe is me, ride with me
Trying to see if  me
Moving lips  no pressure
Keep chasing better, waiting for never, for never
This a feeling like I never felt before
Like I said before
Make me wanna get to know you more and more
It's like dÃ©jÃ  vu
Feel like dÃ©jÃ  vu
For me you're stranger

They call it dÃ©jÃ  vu (dÃ©jÃ  vu, dÃ©jÃ  vu, dÃ©jÃ  vu)
Could you be the dream that I once knew?
(Could you be the dream that I once knew, knew?)
Is it you?
(Feel like real life, could this be you, you?)
DÃ©jÃ  vu (dÃ©jÃ  vu, dÃ©jÃ  vu, dÃ©jÃ  vu)
Could you be the dream that might come true?
(Could you be the dream that might come true, true?)
Shining through
(Could it really be you that's shining through, through?)
I keep remembering me
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
I keep remembering you
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
DÃ©jÃ  vu (DÃ©jÃ  vu)
DÃ©jÃ  vu

This is divine
I've been waiting all my life
Filling time
Looking for you
Nights were more than you could know
Long ago
Come to me now
We don't have to dream of love
We know how, somewhere before
It's as if I've loved you so
So long ago

They call it dÃ©jÃ  vu (dÃ©jÃ  vu, dÃ©jÃ  vu, dÃ©jÃ  vu)
Could you be the dream that I once knew?
(Could you be the dream that I once knew, knew?)
Is it you?
(Feel like real life, could this be you, you?)
DÃ©jÃ  vu (dÃ©jÃ  vu, dÃ©jÃ  vu, dÃ©jÃ  vu)
Could you be the dream that might come true?
(Could you be the dream that might come true, true?)
Shining through
(Could it really be you that's shining through, through?)
I keep remembering me
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
I keep remembering you
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
DÃ©jÃ  vu (DÃ©jÃ  vu)
Ooh-ooh

DÃ©jÃ  vu 
DÃ©jÃ  vu 
DÃ©jÃ  vu

They call it dÃ©jÃ  vu (dÃ©jÃ  vu, dÃ©jÃ  vu, dÃ©jÃ  vu)
Could you be the dream that I once knew?
(Could you be the dream that I once knew, knew?)
Is it you?
(Feel like real life, could this be you, you?)
DÃ©jÃ  vu (dÃ©jÃ  vu, dÃ©jÃ  vu, dÃ©jÃ  vu)
Could you be the dream that might come true?
(Could you be the dream that might come true, true?)
Shining throug...
