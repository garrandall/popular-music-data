Oh, give me land, lots of land
Under starry skies above
Don't fence me in

Let me ride through the
Wide open country that I love
Don't fence me in

Let me be by myself
In the evening breeze
Listen to the murmur
Of the cottonwood trees

Send me off forever
But I ask you please
Don't fence me in

Just turn me loose
Let me straddle my old saddle
Underneath the western skies

On my Cayuse
Let me wander over yonder
Till I see the mountains rise

I want to ride to the ridge
Where the West commences
Gaze at the moon
Till I lose my senses

Can't look at hobbles
And I can't stand fences
Don't fence me in
Don't fence me in

No, don't fence me in
No, don't, don't fence me in
