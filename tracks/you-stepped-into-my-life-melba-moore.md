You stepped into my life
And I'm oh, so happy
You stepped into my life
And I'm oh, so happy

You stepped into my life
Stepped into my life
Stepped into my life
And I'm oh, so happy
You stepped into my life
And I'm oh, so

Before you came my way
I always checked this out
So much pain in love
And so alone inside
I never thought
That I'd believe in love so much

But, darling
When you came close to me
Suddenly
Suddenly

You stepped into my life
And I'm oh, so happy
You stepped into my life
And I'm oh, so happy

You stepped into my life
Stepped into my life
Stepped into my life
And I'm oh, so happy
You stepped into my life
And I'm oh, so

You will never know
What you have done, my love
You gave me so much more
My love is worthy of

Beneath my very soul
I kneel before your touch
Your touch is ecstasy
Close to me
Suddenly
Suddenly

You stepped into my life
Stepped into my life
Stepped into my life
And I'm oh, so happy
You stepped into my life
