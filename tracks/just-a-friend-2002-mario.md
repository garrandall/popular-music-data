You Ready for me


I wanna know your name and
I wanna know if you gotta man (I wanna know)
I wanna know everything
I wanna your number and if I can come over and
I wanna know what you like
I wanna know so I can do it all night
But you're telling me I'm just a friend
You're telling me I'm just a friend


Oh baby you (oh baby you)
Got what I need (got what I need)
But you say I'm just a friend (say I'm just a friend)
But you say I'm just a friend
Cause I can be your (cause I can be your)
Fantasy
But you say I'm just a friend (say I'm just a friend)
But you say I'm just a friend


I wanna know you in and out
I wanna know what you're all about (I wanna know)
I wanna know what makes you laugh
I wanna know about your past
I wanna know how you move
I wanna know so I can move too (I wanna know)
But you're telling me I'm just a friend
Telling me I'm just a friend

+(Mario)
Oh baby you (oh baby you)
Got what I need (got what I need, yeah)
But you say I'm just a friend (say I'm just a friend)
But you say I'm just a friend
Cause I can be your (girl I can be your)
Fantasy (fantasy, yeah)
But you say I'm just a friend (say I'm just a friend)
But you say I'm just a friend



Oh can you give me one reason why (why)
You wouldn't want this kinda guy
Cause I stay dipped, I stay laced
And I know, you know I'm fly
Girl, stop playing games with me
And let's get it on tonight
You got nothing to lose
Let me do what I do


Oh baby you
Got what I need (got what I need)
But you say I'm just a friend (say I'm just a friend)
But you say I'm just a friend
(Just wanna be your)
Cause I can be your fantasy (fantasy, girl)
But you say I'm just a friend (but you say )
But you say I'm just a friend


You can call me anytime you like (oh anytime)
It doesn't matter day or night (said it doesn't matter)
We can do whatever you (oh)
Wanna do it's up to you
Don't fight the feeling that you feel (don't fight the feeling)
I can tell that its real (oh girl)
So won't you help me understand
Why you say I'm just a friend
