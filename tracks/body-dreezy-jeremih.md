Yo body on my body baby
I'm about to catch a body in here baby
I love the way you grind on me
Said I'm about to catch a body in here baby
It's going down
I'm about to catch a body
Oh yeah oh yeah, don't stop it now
I'm about to catch a body


Keep it a hunnid boy I know that you want it
Another round won't remember in the morning
Got on your shirt, put in that work
Until you clock out
Mike Tyson boy you know I got that knock out
Take a dive inside this liquor
Got me pulling on your zipper
He wanna hit a lick, I got my legs up like a stick up
I woke up in my glory
Keep a K with me like Kourtney
Since a shorty I been popping like a forty
End of story baby

You work that thang like a nine to five
Clock in to work and put in over time
I pull up on you with that thang through your back
And beat it up like ra-ta-ta-ta-tat (lock and load it)
Got a Uzi on your booty know you popping
Clip after clip ain't got no problem with me watching
Come on outside
We got all night
Pull that tick tocking
Smith and Wesson bout to teach yo ass a lesson
Start undressing


Ain't going home baby we could go all night (yeah)
Drop all yo hoes let me show you ima rider
Make the neighbors call the cops
Still ain't finna stop
I see these bitches tryna block
Take another shot
Bang Bang you look good boy
You could be my main thing
Rich sex I saw your chain slang I'm on the same thing
Might give in if you don't let up
I'm just tryna fuck your bed up
Talking shit gon' get you hit
Boy don't get wet up, it's a set up
Baby

You me and me on you baby
So tell me what you wanna do baby
Said everything is up to you baby
So it's up to you
This could be your best night
Get you home for the night
And do you just right
Time of your life
Get you home for the night
And do you just right



This could be your best night
Get you home for the night
And do you just right (ima bout to catch a body in here baby)
