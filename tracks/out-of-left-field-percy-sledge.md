When least expected
Fate stumbles in
Bringing light to the darkness
Oh, what a friend

I needed someone to call my own
Suddenly, out of left field
Out of left field, out of left field
Came a lover and a friend

I was walking down a road that went no where
Building dreams that were all left by the way side
And then outta the blue
Honey, I met you, oh

Sugar and peaches in a paradise land
Good love and sweetness, has taken their stand
She made me a mountain
From a little grain of sand

Suddenly, out of left field
Out of left field
Out of left field
Came a lover and a friend
She was a lover and a friend
Came out of nowhere

She made me what I am today
She made me a man
The everything
Everything is alright
Everything is alright
How sweet it is
