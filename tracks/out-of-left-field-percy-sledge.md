When least expected
Fate stumbles in
Bringing light to the darkness
Ohh, what a friend

I needed someone to call my own
Suddenly, out left field
Out left field, out left field
Love came along, ooh

I was walking down a road that went no where
Building dreams that were all left by the way side
And then outta the blue
Honey, I found you, ohh, yeah

Sugar and peaches in a paradise land
Good love and sweetness, have taken their stand
She made a mountain of love
From a little grain of sand

Suddenly, out of left field
Came a lover and a friend
She was a lover and a friend
Came out of nowhere

She made me a man
Every thing is alright
How sweet it is
