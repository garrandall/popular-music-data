People talking trying to break us up
Why won't they let us be
Bricks and stones may break my bones
But talk don't bother me
People talkin' tryin' to break us up
When they know that I love you so
So I don't care what the people may say
I'll never never let you go


I've been abused
(I've been abused)
In my heart
(my heart's been torn)
I've been accused
(I've been accused)
I've been 'buked
(I've been 'buked and I've been stung)


People talkin' tryin' to break us up, yeah
Scandlizin' my name
They'll say anything just to make me feel bad
Yes anything to make me shame




People talkin' tryin' to break us, yup
And they scandlizin' my name
They'll say anything just to make me feel bad
Yes anything to make me shame


Yes I know
(oh, yes I know)
Yes I know it
(oh, yes I know)
And you know it, too
(oh, yes I know)
Don't you know it, too
(oh, yes I know)
Ohhhhh, don't you know it too
