I always swore that
Falling in love was not
Something that I would ever
Want to do

Then you came along
And lit a fire in my heart
Now I swear I won't give up
Until I get you

Into my love
It's the only way
'Cause I just can't get you
Out of my mind
Oh, no

Into my love
I need you night and day
I just can't stop this
Feeling for you
Only one thing left to do
I just got to get you
Into my love

Sometimes I wake up
In the middle of the night
And just lay there
Thinking about you
I'm hooked on that feeling
And I really don't know why
But I know that you're the one
And I got to get you

Into my love
It's the only way
'Cause I just can't get you
Out of my mind
Oh, no

Into my love
I need you night and day
I just can't stop this
Feeling for you
Only one thing left to do
I just got to get you
Into my love

Into my love
I'll be good to you baby
Into my love
You don't have to be afraid
Into my love
Boy, you're driving me crazy
Then I just won't rest
'Til I get you out of my head

Into my love
It's the only way
'Cause I just can't get you
Out of my mind
Oh, no

Into my love
I need you night and day
I just can't stop this
Feeling for you
Only one thing left to do
I just got to get you
Into my love

It's the only way
'Cause I just can't get you
Out of my mind
Oh, no

Into my love
I need you night and day
I just can't stop this
Feeling for you
