Refugee public, Akon, and on and on
All hands on deck

Can I go in for a minute?
Cause there's no limit to the Cash Money Hip Hop game


Things done changed but they stay the same
I see molly is the new cocaine
I see them rappers with them big gold chains
Remind me of the Slick Rick rings
And Rakim was the microphone fiend
And Bobby Brown was the RnB king
Yeah, now every rapper wanna bang
What happen to the days we were all in the same gang?


Missy and Timbaland, original dubstep
And Bambaataa had our future on tape deck
Man, my daughter is seven I had to put her in check
And let her know that K.R.S.
Is more than letters in the alphabets
She's Will.I.Am'ing with her mommy
She's like: "Dad, let me teach you how to dougie"
Things done changed but they stay the same
I'm bumping Nas in the Range down memory lane
Talib, Mos Def, PE bought them lectures
My first music video Rakim, I was the extra
Run DMC ran rap, now run's a preacher
And we all are poor righteous teachers
Krush grooving, body moving
Rhazel, Doug E. Fresh, Biz Mark had me beat boxin
And Kim, Foxy and Eve are all warriors
Ya MC Lytes, ya not B's, ya'll Queen Latifah's
Looks... pretty Nicki's in Ibiza
And every fella had a crush on Salt N Peppa
She so Naughty By Nature, Long.Live.A$AP
Written on a Wolf Gang back pack


Things done changed but they stay the same
I see molly is the new cocaine
Yeah I see the rappers man poppin' champagne
Them Beasty Boys that Rick Rubin
And Big L was the lyrical king, and Bobby Brown was the rnb king
And we all wanted to be Russell Simmons
What happened to the day when we were all in the same gang?


Yeah my young cousins rock Chief Keef tattoos
They say Easy E, what an attitude
I'm talking Cypress Hill, I'm talking Ice Cube
I'm talking Ice-T, Dr Dre, Snoop
Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, Crucial conflict
Twista, Tech N9ne, flipped it this way
I'm talking from back in the day in the bay
Keak Da Sneak and the homie Mack Dre
They should have made a hip-hop dictionary written by E-40
Red & Meth, Keith Murray, Kanye, Trick Daddy, Too $hort
Flo ridin' with a Pitbull, Miami going crazy
Bambi, Pimp C, UGK, Master P
Had me listening to the south in a new way
And I miss Outkast like people miss the Fugees
And there's a Birdman watching over New Orleans
And Scarface never seen a thug cry
Till he seen his Dogg Nate singin' hooks from the sky


Things done changed but they stay the same
I see molly is the new cocaine
I see them rappers with the big gold chains
LL Cool J Ja, Irv, Murder Inc Fat Joe, Big Pun, Cuban Link
We all wanted 5 mics in The Source magazine
French Montana at the Red CafÃ©
Wiz Khalifa rol the paper up 'we're all in the same gang'


When I hear Waka, I hear ODB slang
I'm talking Wu Tang, Raekwon, 2Chainz
EPMD remind me of them Coke boys
And Joey Bada$$'s, Uncle Murda, boys
Grandmaster Flash red alert, I'm talking Kool Herc
Jazzy Jeff, Fresh Prince brought it to suburbs
And hip hop will never be the same
Since Eminem lost Proof and Heavy's out the game
We still immortal with the technique, making good music
But the tables ain't been the same since Jam Master used it
And Common used to love her and her 2Live Crew
Cause she stuck to her roots and let the DJ Screw
From Busta, Jay, Meek Mills to Tip to Quik
Kendrick Lamar, Luda, Ross, Wayne and Drake
50, Future & Game, Tribe Quest, Wale
And if we miss you, Puff Daddy do the remix


Things done changed but they stay the same
I see molly is the new cocaine
A new Jesus piece with Chris Lighty's name
Biggy and Pac, East and West Coast kids
Mary J Blige, RnB queen
G-Unit, Ruff Ryders, Mobb Deep, DMX
Lox, Dipset, and we all in same game
