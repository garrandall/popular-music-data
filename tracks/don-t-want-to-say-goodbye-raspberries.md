Don't Want To Say Goodbye
Don't want to drive your love away from me
Don't want to waste your time
You're here and there and far away from me
I'm so alone, it's just a crime
If you could lie here by my side at night
If you could chase away my blues
You'd understand just how it feels at night
To have to stand inside my shoes
Don't want to say goodbye
Don't want to let you see me cry
Still, I don't want you to live a lie
I'm gonna try a little harder
I'm gonna try a little harder
I'm gonna try a little harder
And maybe you'll love me
Don't want to drive your love away from me
Don't want to waste your time
You're here and there and far away from me
I'm so alone, it's just a crime
