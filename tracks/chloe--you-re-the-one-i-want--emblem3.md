Chloe, I know your sister turns everyone on
But you're the one I want
But you're the one I want, yeah


Front page magazine
Everybody says that she's a queen
But that's you to me
I just wanna let you know that
She likes the flashing lights
I love the way that you like candle light
Stay close by my side
I just want a chance to show that


If only you could believe in yourself in the way I believe in you
I-I do (But you're the one I want)
If only you could see all of the beautiful things that I see in you
It's true-oo-oo-oo


Chloe, I know your sister turns everyone on
But, oh, baby, I have no doubt you're the one that I want (Woo-woo)
You think she's got it all but that don't make her better (Woo-woo)
You got my heart and that's the only thing that matters
Chloe, I know your sister turns everyone on
But you're the one I want
But you're the one I want, yeah


Fast lanes, limousines
Baby, there can be no guarantees
But if you're with me, you know that I can guarantee that
'Cause I'm attracted to your passion
Be yourself, forget the fashion
Just keep that smile you're flashing
'Cause you and I deserve to be forever ever lasting


If only you could believe in yourself in the way I believe in you
I-I do (you're the one I want)
If only you could see all of the beautiful things that I see in you
It's true-oo-oo-oo


Chloe, I know your sister turns everyone on
But oh, baby, I have no doubt you're the one that I want
You think she's got it all but that don't make her better
You've got my heart and that's the only thing that matters
Chloe, I know your sister turns everyone on
But you're the one I want
You're the one I want


All you Chloe's
All you Chloe's
They don't show you love enough (Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
All you Chloe's
You should know that you're my diamond in the rough
It's true-oo-oo-oo


Chloe, I know your sister turns everyone on
But oh, baby, I have no doubt you're the one that I want
You think she's got it all but that don't make her better
You've got my heart and that's the only thing that matters
Chloe, I know your sister turns everyone on
But you're the one I want
But you're the one I want
