Here you are
You can not stop
Where are you going? If I'm crazy to have you
How would I know
I would see you again


You confuse me, I do not know what to do
What I want is to have a good time
I'm afraid that I like it
And go crazy
If that happens I will continue
With you here as a faithful dog
I'm afraid that I like it
And go crazy


I'm serious, mai, I'm not playing
So much time passes and nothing
I can not stand this desire
And although you dodge me, I still want you
They say that you are dangerous
I do not pay attention to those things
Tell me what's going on
You have me crazy, I'm crazy in love, huh
I want to know how much you're going to insist
And how far would you get for me
I really feel the wait
But it will be worth it when I'm kissing you
The way you move like this
I swear, I'm going to melt
You know I'm good
As much as I dodge you, you still want me


You confuse me, I do not know what to do
What I want is to have a good time
I'm afraid that I like it
And go crazy
If that happens I will continue
With you here as a faithful dog
I'm afraid that I like it
And go crazy


Crazy-to-bite
I do not ask for anything extraordinary
Only a real man
Let it be thrown by me to the mud
I changed the light bulbs and until I washed the car
I want a kind and caring kind
But do not be too jealous
That on the street be a prince
But that in my bed is wild and dangerous


You can ask whatever you want from me
I would do anything for you
I really feel the wait
But it will be worth it when I'm kissing you
I'm sure I'm done for you
I swear to you, I will not make you suffer
Like I told you, babe
As much as you dodge me, I still want you


You confuse me, I do not know what to do
What I want is to have a good time
I'm afraid that I like it
And go crazy
If that happens I will continue
With you here as a faithful dog
I'm afraid that I like it
And go crazy


Crazy-to-bite
Here you are
You can not stop
Where are you going? (Oh!)
If I'm crazy to have you
