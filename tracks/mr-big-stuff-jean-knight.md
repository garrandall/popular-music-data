(Oh yeah)(Oh)
Mr. Big Stuff

Who do you think you are?
Mr. Big Stuff
You're never gonna get my love
Now, because you wear all those fancy clothes (oh yeah)

And have a big, fine car, oh yes you do now
Do you think I can afford to give you my love? (oh yeah)
You think you're higher than every star above
Mr. Big Stuff

Who do you think you are?
Mr. Big Stuff
You're never gonna get my love
Now, I know all the girls I've seen you with

I know you broke their hearts one after another now, bit by bit
You made 'em cry, many poor girls cry
When they tried to keep you happy, they just tried to keep you satisfied
Mr. Big Stuff, tell me, tell me

Who do you think you are?
Mr. Big Stuff
You're never gonna get my love
BREAK

I'd rather give my love to a poor guy that has a love that's true (oh yeah)

Than to be fooled around and get hurt by you
'Cause when I give my love, I want love in return (oh yeah)
Now, I know this is a lesson, Mr. Big Stuff, you haven't learned
Mr. Big Stuff, tell me

Who do you think you are?
Mr. Big Stuff
You're never gonna get my love
Mr. Big Stuff
You're never gonna break my heart
Mr. Big Stuff
You're never gonna make me cry
(Repeat and fade out)
