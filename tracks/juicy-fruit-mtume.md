Yeah
(I like it, oh, oh)
(I like it, oh, oh)
I need it, I need it
Oh, girl

You know very well
What you are
You're my sugar thing
My chocolate star

I've had a few
But not that many
But you're the only love
That gives me good and plenty

Juicy fruit (Juicy)
Juicy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey)
Juicy fruit (Juicy)
Juicy

Candy rain
Comin' down
Taste you in my mind
And spread you all around

Here I am
Oh, this love's for you
Hey, baby
Sweet as honey dew

Close my eyes
Oh, what fantasy
And you're right here with me
Juicy

Cherry blossom kiss
What you're givin'
Makes my body rock
Keeps me sizzlin'

Do what you want
I don't care
I'll be your lollipop
(You can lick me everywhere)

Juicy fruit (You're so)
Juicy (Juicy)
Juicy fruit (Yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Juicy

Here I am
This love's for you
Hey, baby
You're sweet as honey dew

Close my eyes
Oh, what fantasy
And you're right here with me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Juicy fruit
Juicy

Juicy fruit (Juicy)
Juicy (I like it, I like it)
Juicy fruit (In the morning, oh, babe)
Juicy (Oh, oh)

Juicy fruit (Candy rain comin' down)
Juicy (Turns me all around)
Juicy fruit (I like it, I like it)
Juicy
