Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

You give me fever - you give me fever - when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight - you give me fever
Fever - in the mornin'
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the day time
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
'Cause I know you're gonna treat me right

You give me fever - you give me fever - when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight - you give me fever
Fever - in the mornin'
Fever all through the night - wow!

Everybody's got the fever
That is somethin' you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long time ago

You give me fever
Baby, turn on your love light - yeah, yeah
Let it shine on me - yeah, yeah
Well, baby, turn on your love light - yeah, yeah
And let it shine on me - yeah, yeah
Well, just a little bit higher - yeah, yeah
And just a little bit brighter, baby - yeah, yeah
Owww!

You give me fever - yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You give me fever - yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You give me fever - yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You give me fever
