It was Tiger Wilson versus Kid McCoy
In the summer of 'ninety-three
Now the Kid was everybody's pride and joy
Just as game as a kid could be
And his darlin' Bess was in the second row
She was prayin' with all her might
Sayin', "Kid, we need that little bungalow
Oh, you've just gotta win tonight"

Come on, Kid, come on, Kid
Let's hit him with a left and a right
Go on, Kid, go on, Kid
But how were they to know it was the Kid's last fight
(But how were they to know it was the Kid's last fight)

Now the Kid had fever to the very bone
But nobody would ever guess
He was in there fightin' on his heart alone
'Cause he just had to win for Bess
Oh, the Kid was battered, the Kid was floored
But the count never got to ten
Though his brain was reelin' when the people roared
He was up on his feet again

Come on, Kid, come on, Kid
Let's hit him with a left and a right
Go on, Kid, go on, Kid
But how were they to know it was the Kid's last fight
(But how were they to know it was the Kid's last fight)

Said the Tiger, scowlin', don't you know you're through I can whip you just like a child
I'm gonna take the fight and take your woman too
When he heard that the Kid went wild
Said the Kid "For that I'll tear you limb from limb"
And he sprang like an angry colt He said a punch a-flyin at the Tiger's chin
Knocked him out like a thunderbolt

Come on, Kid, come on, Kid
Let's hit him with a left and a right
Go on, Kid, go on, Kid
But how were they to know it was the Kid's last fight
(But how were they to know it was the Kid's last fight)

To the crowd that saw it there was little doubt
That the Kid was a champ that night
But the champ would never have another bout
'Twas the fever that won the fight
Gather round, I'm bettin' even money folks
There's a bell soundin' way up high
And the champ is climbin' through the golden ropes
Of the Big Ring up in the sky

Come on, Kid, come on, Kid
Let's hit him with a left and a right
Go on, Kid, go on, Kid
But how were they to know it was the Kid's last fight
