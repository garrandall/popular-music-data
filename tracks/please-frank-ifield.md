I got an anonymous phone call from someone last night
And a voice soft and low said:
"Listen here friend, your girl's going out
With some other guy, and I think you should
Know your girl is untrue
Know there's somebody new
And the love of your life
She's making a fool of you"

I hung up the phone and I went to my room and I cried
Cried all through the night
I said to myself, if I lost your love
My life would just end, so I'm begging you
Please, please say it's a lie
From some envious guy
And the only thing true
Is you love me like I love you!

I got an anonymous phone call from someone last night...
