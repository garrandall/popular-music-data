I got 7 hours, baby. So what cha wanna do?
(Ooh - I wanna melt with u)
(Ooh - I wanna melt with u)

This is safe sex, (Ooh - I wanna melt with u)
New Power Generation style
A funky little story about u and me (Ooh - I wanna melt with u)
Gettin busy 4 awhile
From the tip of my typhoon (Ooh - I wanna melt with u)
2 the bottom of your ankle chains
We gonna shake and shake and shake
Until we're both deranged
With endorphins
This is the ultimate rave
Ooh - I wanna melt with u
S 2 the S

Slow and slippery, groovy
If we bathe in each other's hips
In other words, get close enough to stick
And I'll melt with u
And u can melt with me 2
And we'll groove and groove until the earth moves
I want 2 melt with u, yeah

Don't look now, but there's a river of blood
U must have been a virgin
What am I guilty of? Oh no (oh no)
Are u afraid? Then take me 2 the next phase...

Slow and slippery, groovy
If we bathe in each other's hips
In other words, get close enough to stick (oh yeah)
And I'll melt with u (melting)
And u can melt with me 2
And we'll groove and groove until the earth moves
I want 2 melt with u, yeah (Hit me)

I'm thinkin' about the quivery ocean (ooh, I wanna melt with u)
And drippin' all over your every motion
And thinkin' about the way that u kiss (I wanna melt with u)
I'm thinkin' about some of this
And I'm thinkin' about some of that
And then my backbone slips (I wanna melt with u)
And my lips just drip
And then the hips just whip and whip and...
(I wanna melt with u)
(I wanna melt with u)

Yeah, do that baby
Yeah, do that baby
Yeah, do that baby, just like a dog (ooh, I wanna melt with u)
Yeah, do that baby, just like a dog (ooh, I wanna melt with u)
Yeah, do that baby, just like a dog

Slow and slippery, groovy
If we bathe in each other's hips(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
I want 2 melt with u
And I'll melt with u
And u can melt with me 2
And we'll groove and groove until the earth moves (1,2,3,4,5,6,7)

Melting, melting, melting...

Slow and slippery, groovy
If we bathe in each other's hips
In other words, get close enough to stick
And I'll melt with u
And u can melt with me 2
And we'll groove and groove until the earth moves (Whip it)
