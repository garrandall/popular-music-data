It's Friday and late after hours
And still I haven't a date
Waiting by the moon
Sipping Whiskey sours
I'll think I'll wait here 'till noon
It really could be days
'Til I find some flowers
So I'll send you a bouquet

Chorus 1:
Uptown, run around, hear the sound, of the city streets below
And people in a rush everywhere
No rain, sugar cane, just a grain
In my champagne glass, you know
You put that magic touch in the air

So they say, it's closing time again
Funny how time passes
Through a bottle of Champagne
The only sound I hear, is that of rattling glasses
And people laughing in my ear
You've taken far too much, since you left for Paris
You've got that magic touch

Chorus 2:
Uptown, run around, hear the sound, of the city streets below
And the people rush everywhere
No rain, sugar cane, just a grain
In my Champagne glass, you know
You put that magic touch in the air
See those people in a rush
But you've got that magic touch
(Repeat twice)

Repeat Chorus 1 'til fade
