If my sadness brought you gladness, I'd be glad to be sad
If my feeling bad made you feel good, I would always feel bad
And I wouldn't think twice about the sacrifice
Anything that I'd have to do
'Cause whatever makes you happy makes me happy too

If my tears could make you smile, I could smile through my tears
Oh, your sweet and lovely voice is music to my ears
Oh, and I wouldn't think twice about the sacrifice
Anything that I'd have to do
'Cause whatever makes you happy makes me happy too

Even if you wanted someone else to take my place
Although I love you so much, I'd still give you up
Just to keep a smile on your face

If my woes seem to please you, I'd be pleased with my woe
And if my sorrow brought you joy, I'd enjoy my sorrow
And I wouldn't think twice about the sacrifice
Anything that I'd have to do
'Cause whatever (makes you happy)
Whatever (makes you happy)
Tell her one more time
(Makes you happy)
Would make me happy tooâ¦
