Oh you may not love me now but I'm stayin' around
'Cause you want my company
Just like push can turn to shove, like can turn to love
It's my philosophy that

If you can want, you can need
And if you can need, you can care
If you can care, you can love, now
So when you want me, I'll be there
Said whenever you want me, I'll be there

Oh now this may take some time, if time was money
I would be a millionaire
So whenever you want me, call any time at all
And for sure I'll be right there, 'cause

If you can want, you can need
And if you can need baby, you can care
If you can care, you can love
So when you want me, I'll be there
I'll be there whenever you want me, oh yeah

I'll be standin' by, not far way
Let your heart give me a sign
'Cause I'm prepared to wait until I abdicate
When you want me all the time, 'cause

You can want, you can need
If you can need baby, you can care
If you can care baby you can love
So when you want me, I'll be there
I'll be there whenever you want me

You can want, you can need
And if you can need baby, you can care
