Baby, you're hotter
Than a bowl of soup
You're oh so very hot
And, baby, you're cooler
Than the coolest snow
You know, you know
That baby, you're sweeter than sugar
Uh huh, (uh huh), uh huh, (uh huh)
Oh, baby, you can't be beat, no, no
Sweeter than sugar
Oh, sugar, you're so sweet

Baby, you're softer
Than a cotton field
You're oh so very soft
And you're so good lookin'
I can't help but stare
Cause you're all there
And, baby, you're sweeter than sugar
Uh huh, (uh huh), uh huh, (uh huh)
Baby, you can't be beat, no, no
Sweeter than sugar
Cause, sugar, you're so sweet

(Ah)
(You're sweet, you're sweet, you're oh so sweet)
(So sweet. so sweet, so very sweet)
(You're sweet, so sweet, you're oh so sweet)

And you're doin' me fine
You do me outta my mind
And I'm a lucky, so lucky, I love her, cause I'm lucky? (96% correct?)
Cause you're sweeter than sugar
Uh huh, (uh huh), uh huh, (uh huh)
Baby, you can't be beat, no, no
Sweeter than sugar
Oh sugar you're so sweet
(One two tree four, sugar, I'm takin' more)
Sweeter than sugar
Uh huh, (uh huh), uh huh, (uh huh)
Baby you can't be beat, no, no
Sweeter than sugar
Uh huh, (uh huh), uh huh, (uh huh)
Oh, no, you're sweeter than...
Sweeter than sugar
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
Oh baby you and me we're a
Sweeter than sugar fade to finish
