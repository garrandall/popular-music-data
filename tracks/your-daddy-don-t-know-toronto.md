Her daddy don't like me, cause I'm from the hood
Her mama don't like me, cause I'm from the hood
You know where to find, me, I be in the hood
I be in the, I be in the, I be in the hood.

I'm not what he expected
Pants below my ass, hat back, big necklace
I'm pretty sure your mama had an objection
Is it just my hood, or maybe it's my complexion?
Besides the fact that I'm young and all
Your Pop'll probably think I'm trying to get my thuggin' on
And with that, he probably thinks there's more than one involved
Like you would give it up, and figures that I'm done with y'all
Lady, you know I'm besides that
I aint gotta drive, call my chauffeur you can ride back
Anything you want little mama, I can buy that
Tell me what you need and I promise I'll supply that
She likes it when my Tims look fresh, hat to the back
Jeans stay sagging, True Religion just to match
Always dressed up, but you know I never "slack"
See I know a lot of things, one thing I know is that.

Her daddy don't like me, cause I'm from the hood
Her mama don't like me, cause I'm from the hood
You know where to find, me, I be in the hood
I be in the, I be in the, I be in the hood.

Tell your parents that your leaving
If they ask why, tell them Jazzy is the reason
Your mama thinks you're out, trying to be TLC
She said, "what about your friends?"
And you said, "they all creeping"
You crow two up in a benz and
Trying to show em that your ass is independent
Yeah, but you got, different friends
And different friends, lead to beginnings with different ends
I can show you how to do it
Got a little swag but, i can add to it
Baby you a realist, and I be a truest
I can your man, baby girl thats what the truth is...
And I won't take you on a date
What you know about them flights from Toronto to Kuwait
Tell your daddy he can wait, cause I'm with his daughter now
And when we get up in that bed, I'ma lay his daughter down.

Her daddy don't like me, cause I'm from the hood
Her mama don't like me, cause I'm from the hood
You know where to find, me, I be in the hood
I be in the, I be in the, I be in the hood.

Let me break it down for you on some real T.O gangsta shit
Rollin' through the city hot, like we in Los Angeles
North Hollywood, cause I be from the hood
She said her daddy don't like me, but it's all good
Addicted to the cars, jewels and clothes livin the fast life
Living everyday to the fullest like it's my last life
Got my cash right, shinin' bright
Yeah, even on a cloudy day, you can see me comin from a mile away
All tatted up, straps in the tuck, whip so clean
Got her movin like a stripper trying to impress me
Had to tell the chick look, you gon need more than that
Go learn to bag weight, go flip it and bring it back
Cause I'm really in the streets, this is deeper than rap
Girl i need a girl to have my back, the loyaltys treasured most
So when the times get rough, I know she right there with and I dont give a
fuck if her,

Her daddy don't like me, cause I'm from the hood
Her mama don't like me, cause I'm from the hood
You know where to find me, I be in the hood
I be in the, I be in the, I be in the hood.
