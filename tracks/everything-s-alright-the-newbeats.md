There's a bunch of guys in town
Whose been buggin' you and hangin' around
And calling you on the phone and talkin' real smart
Ev'ry brand new him that calls is one of them
They're trying to mess us up and make us part

They're gangin' up on my baby, comin' on strong
Tryin' to turn you against me and take you home
But baby, don't listen, baby
Everything's alright

Ain't gettin' you, baby, without a fight
Oh baby, hold me tight
Everything's alright

This bunch of alley cats oughta be chasin' rats
Instead of a little mouse's ear like you
But they're out doing their best, tryin' their best
To mess up a love that's honest and true

They're gangin' up on my baby, comin' on strong
Tryin' to turn you against me and take you home
But baby, don't listen, baby
Everything's alright

Ain't gettin' you, baby, without a fight
Oh baby, hold me tight
Everything's alright, everything's alright
