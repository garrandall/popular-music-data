For once in my life
I have someone who needs me
Someone I needed so long
For once unafraid
I can go where life leads me
And somehow I know I'll be strong
For once I can't touch
What my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Oh, oh, oh, someone like you
Would ever dream of makin my dreams come true
For once in my life
I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before, oh
For once I have something I know desert me
Cause I'm not alone anymore
For once I can say
This is mine, you can't take it
Long as I know I've got love I can make it
For once in my life
I've got that someone who needs me
Mmm... hm... hm...
For once I can say
This is sho nuff mine, you can't take it
Long as I know I've got love I can make it
For once in my life
I've got that someone who needs me
Oh, yes, he does
I've got that someone who needs me
He told me this mornin that he needed me
Mmm... mmm... I believe
