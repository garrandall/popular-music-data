Cry, baby, cry
Baby, cry

Cry, baby, cry
And you'll feel better
Your tears outside
(Your tears outside)
Are so much wetter

It's wrong to hide
Teardrops inside
When you're blue (so blue)
Oh, when you're in love
(You're in love)

The tears from your eyes
Are nothing but water
So, go on and cry
(Go on and cry)
Just cause you oughta

Cry when you feel
The feeling is real
So cry, baby, cry
Baby, cry

Crying defines your emotions
It's when you cry, you feel
Something for love and devotion
Something so warm and so real

Oh, weep, sweetie, weep
You're only robbing
Yourself of sleep
(Yourself of sleep)
No harm in sobbing

Don't try to hold
Release your soul
And cry, baby, cry
Baby, cry

Come on and cry
Oh, cry (cry) cry (cry)...
