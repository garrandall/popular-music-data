Down in Bermuda, paradise for two.
I lost my lover there on the blue.

We went sailing on a coral sea.
Starlit waters, my darling and me.
Time was endless, love sang it's song.
We dreamed of tomorrow. Now he is gone.

I see his lips in the coral.
I see his eyes in the water blue.
I see his hair in the glowing sunlight.
All vision clear, calling me near.

In Bermudan waters, so clear and cold,
I wait my loved one as I grow old.
As I grow old.

Down in Bermuda, paradise for two.
I lost my lover there on the blue.
