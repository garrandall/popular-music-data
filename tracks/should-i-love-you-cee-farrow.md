Le, le-le-le, le-le, le-le, 'lectric
Lay-la-la-lay, la-lay, la-lady
Le, le-le-le, le-le, le-le, 'lectric
Lay-la-la-lay, la-lay, la-lady


Gloss on her lips, glass on the ceiling
All the girls showin love, while the boys catchin feelings
Once you see her face, her eyes you'll remember
and she'll have you fallin harder than a Sunday in September
Whether in Savannah, K-Kansas, or in Atlanta
She'll walk in any room, have you raisin up yo' antennas
She can fly you straight to the MOON or to the ghettos
Wearin tennis shoes or in flats or in stilettos
Illuminating all that she touches, eye on the sparrow
A modern day Joan of her (Arc) or Mia Farrow
Classy, sassy, put you in a razzle-dazzy
Her magnetic energy will have you comin home like Lassie
Singin, "Ooh! Shock it, break it, baby"
Electro, sophisti-, funky, lady
We the kind of girls who ain't afraid to get down
Electric ladies go'n and scream out loud


Electric lady (Ooh-ooh), get waaaaaaaay down (Get down, get down)
Cause tonight, we gon' do what we want to
Electric lady (Ooh-ooh), get waaaaaaaay down (Get down, get down)
Cause tonight, we gon' do what we want to


Her smile is a special effect, her femininity a firework
Enough light to illuminate an entire earth
Just how does one house it?
And I must utter something absolutely avant-garde to arouse it
The smell of you, and the sight of you
The scent to the left and the right of you
I'm somewhere in the ball park of bein all heart
She's the intangibility encouraging all art
And I'm SO sincere
I'd write my name somewhere to let them know that Lo has been here
But no, not to deface it or disgrace it
It's affection, I love you and I'm proud just to brace it
Lady, let your light shine, despite mine
I wanna watch you come alive in the night time
Cause she's been blessed with the best, it's progressive
Turn her up, she's electric.. UHH




Laaaaaaaaaa-dy
Electric laaaa-ie-aaaa-ie-aaaa-ie-aaaa-dyyy
Yeah


I got that Georgia power
And the way I thrust my hips be havin her drippin for some hours
Extracting divine nectar from her flower, no botanist
But dubbin it down with such prowess
And cowards are easily devoured
Ain't no need for sweet and sour chicken
And see about 'em, we about to meteor shower
From the top of the heavens, down to the earth
Intergalactic satisfaction with me burst a pair of solar flares
And we don't care cause it's only me and her
Her and me, another dimension in this love and she concurs (she concurs)
Or.. agree to disagree
We might bump heads, then bump uglies because she's into me
Or shall I say I'm all the way into her, on that ass like some yoga pants
Naked Pilates get it started, then that pole dance
Keep it swollen like a boxer's eye with no hands
With no hands.... {NO HANDS}


Ooh, shock it, break it, baby (Electric Lady..)
Electric Lady, Electric Lady (Get waaaay down)
Ooh, shock it, break it, baby 
Electric Lady, Electric Lady (Gotta get down, down, down, down down)
Ooh, shock it, break it, baby (Gotta get DOWN!)
Electric Lady, Electric Lady (Electric Lady, get dooooooown)
Ooh, shock it, break it, baby 
Electric Lady, Electric Lady (Get down, get down)
