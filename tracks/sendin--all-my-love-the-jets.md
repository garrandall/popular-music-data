Sendin' all my love to you, baby
Sendin' all my love to you
Sendin' all my love to you, baby
Sendin' all my love to you

I see you lookin' at her, baby
It's not hard to do
And even though she's been your baby
It's me for you

She captures every eye all the time
I know when I catch yours, you'll be mine
I've got so much to say
Until you look my way

Sendin' all my love to you, baby
Sendin' all my love to you
Sendin' all my love to you, baby
Sendin' all my love to you

I never lose my concentration
The stronger I feel
Come on now give me some attention
And a love that's real

She captures every eye all the time
If I could just catch yours, you'd be mine
I've got so much to say
Uh, would you look my way

Sendin' all my love to you, baby
Sendin' all my love to you
Sendin' all my love to you, baby
Sendin' all my love to you

I'll give a lot of love, it's true, boy
That's what it's about
That in my heart I've got something special
You'll find out, baby

She captures every eye all the time
If I could just catch yours, you'd be mine
I've got so much to say
Uh, would you look my way

Sendin' all my love to you, baby
Sendin' all my love to you
Sendin' all my love to you, baby
Sendin' all my love to you

Sendin' all my love to you, baby
Sendin' all my love to you
Sendin' all my love to you, baby
Sendin' all my love to you

Sendin' all my love
Sendin' all my love
Sendin' all my love
Sendin' all my love
