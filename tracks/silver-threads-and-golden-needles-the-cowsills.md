I don't want your lonely mansion
With a tear in every room
All I want's the love you promised
Beneath the silvery moon

Well, you think I could be happy
With your money and your name
Just to hide my head in sorrow
While you play your cheating game

Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare not drown my sorrow
In the warm glow of your wine

You can't buy my love for money
Cause I never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine

I don't want your lonely mansion
With a tear in every room
All I want's the love you promised
Beneath the silvery moon

You can't buy my love for money
Cause I never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine

Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
Mine, mine, mine
