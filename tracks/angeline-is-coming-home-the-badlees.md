Her parents' house exudes a reborn air
The bathtub virgins in the midnight air
Seem to smile in celebration
What an intercession
All inertia washed away


Resplendent in dignity
Angeline is coming home


I'd fantasize her
Clean and home again
The quintessential reverie
Free of pain

Just to keep from going crazy
While the cracks had claimed her
And how that fantasy sustained


Resplendent in dignity
Angeline is coming home


The beautiful acquaintance
I desired has inspired me
To levels unforeseen
True admiration for someone
Whose made it back from
The hell she was in

(The hell she was in)
The hell she was in
(The hell she was in)
Aw, yeah, man


When do I see her?
What's said when I do?
Do I let fantasized ideals come through?

To hear her laugh
At my hyperbole
Would send me
It's nice to have her
Home and whole


Resplendent in dignity
Angeline is coming home
She's coming home
Resplendent in dignity
Angeline is coming

Angeline is coming
Angeline is coming home
Hey, yeah
She's coming come
