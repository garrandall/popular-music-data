I don't know much about dancin'
That's why I got this song
One of my legs is shorter than the other
And both my feet's too long
'Course now right along with 'em
I got no natural rhythm
But I go dancin' every night
Hopin' one day I might get it right
I'm a Dancin' fool
I'm a Dancin' fool
I'm a Dancin' fool
I'm a Dancin' fool
I hear that beat
I jump outta my seat
But I can't compete
'Cause I'm a
Dancin' fool
I'm a Dancin' fool

The disco folks all dressed up
Like they's fit to kill
I walk on in 'n see 'em there
Gonna give them all a thrill
When they see me comin'
They all steps aside
They has a fit while I commit
My social suicide

I'm a Dancin' fool
I'm a Dancin' fool
I'm a Dancin' fool
I'm a Dancin' fool

The beat goes on
And I'm so wrong
(Ahhhhhh)
The beat goes on
And I'm so wrong
(Ahhhhhh)
The beat goes on
And I'm so wrong
(Ahhhhhh)

The beat goes on and I'm so wrong
The beat goes on and I'm so wrong
The beat goes on and I'm so wrong
The beat goes on and I'm so wrong
I may be totally wrong, but I'm a
Dancin' fool,
I may be totally wrong, but I'm a
Dancin' fool

Yowsa, yowsa, yowsa

I've got it all together now
With my very own disco clothes, hey!
My shirt's half open, to show you my chain
And the spoon for up my nose
I am-a really something
That's what you'd probably say
So smoke your little smoke
Drink your little drink
While I dance the night away

I'm a
Dancin' fool
I'm a
Dancin' fool
I'm a
Dancin' fool
I'm a
Dancin' fool
He's a
Dancin' fool

I may be totally wrong but I'm a
I may be totally wrong but I'm a
I may be totally wrong but I'm a
I May Be Totally wrong but I'm a FOOL, yeah! Uh!

Hey, darlin'... can I buy ya a couple 'a drinks, Hmm?
Lookin' for Mister Goodbar?
Here he is...
Wait a minute...
I've got it... you're an Italian!
Huh?
Yer Jewish?
Love your nails ...
You must be a Libra... Your place or mine?
Heh heh heh yeah...
