I used to think that it all stopped happening
By the time you reached twenty one
They said there's nothing like the first love you get boy
They were wrong, oh so wrong
They hung on and hung on, to their dream, I know

CHORUS
Life gets better yeah
Whenever I'm in her arms
Just to know I'm not the average fella
I'm the one, I'm the one for her

Well it's a shame what they do to these young kids
Just encourage them to act like clowns
And then they think that they don't have much longer
Knocked up the first time she let em get down
Put four walls around and then scream, but I know

REPEAT CHORUS

Life stretches before me an endless mystery
And nothing can bore me, when she's with me
I feel the heartbeat of the world in the hands of this girl
But it takes so much time to, to finally see, see, see

I get a thrill when I think how it really is
No one can ever take that away
They try to put rubber bands around your heart
But they're wrong, oh so wrong, they hung on
And hung on, to their dream, but I know

Life gets better yeah
When ever I'm in her arms
Just to know I'm not the average fella
I'm the one, I'm the one for her

Oooh Life gets better yeah, When ever I'm in her arms
Just to know I'm not the average sucker, I'm the one, I'm the one for her

Oooh Life gets better yeah, Oooh Life gets better yeah
Oooh Life gets better yeah
