Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Understanding and trusting
Is what our love is built on
So won't you at least try to
Respect what we're about, hey

Why leave us alone
Why break up our home
Why leave us alone
Why break up our happy home

Oh... these changes that you're bringing (Bringing)
I can't adjust to
So quickly
I want to at least try to reach you, hey

Why leave us alone (Why leave us alone)
Why break up our home (Oh, no, oh, no)
Why leave us alone
Why break up our happy home

I need you so badly
I want you so, baby
We got the children
And our love and your love, ho, ho

Woo, hoo, woo, hoo, woo, hoo
Woo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Oh

Why leave us alone (Why leave us alone)
Why break up our home
Why leave us alone
Why break up our happy home

I need you so badly
I want you so, baby
I need you so badly
These changes I just can't adjust to
Your love, your love

Don't leave me (Don't leave me)
No, baby (No, baby)
Don't leave me (Don't leave me)
No, baby (No, baby)

Oh

I (Yeah) wanna think about it
I (Yeah) wanna think about it
I (Yeah) can even sing about
I (Yeah) might even dance, yeah, so I can forget about it (Yeah)

Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
