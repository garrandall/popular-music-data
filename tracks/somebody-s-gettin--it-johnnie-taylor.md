(CHORUS)
Somebody's getting it
Somebody's getting your love
Somebody's getting it
Somebody's getting your love

My eyes are open
I don't like what I see
Sombody's getting my action
Someone other than me

Cause when I kiss you
It just ain't the same
You slipped the other night and
Called me someone else's name

(CHORUS)
I thought I had you
In the palm of my hand
Tried to hide you from
All the other men

You knew I was tipping
With someone else
You gave me enough rope
To hang myself

(CHORUS)
Somebody done got it
And split the scene
I should've been home
If you know what I mean

Say it again
Somebody done got it
And split the scene
I should've been home
If you know what I mean

I should've been home
I was not around, yeah
Leaving you lonely
While I was having my fun

You refused to be lonely
Just waiting for me
So you found someone else
To keep you company

(Who done it) I don't know (Lord)
But I sure would like to know
Messing round with my stuff
(Who done it) I don't know
But I sure would like to know
Well, well, well

(CHORUS) 6X to fade
