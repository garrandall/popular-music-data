*Carolina Day gonna rise up sometime
Give me good align said a reason and rhyme
Jump and sing all the time
Work at a' easing my mind

Oh, it's a Carolina day
On a plane out of Logan, up pops a slogan
Talkin' only of easy times
Working at a bottle of ripple wine
Breathing that clean fine southern air
And we all start to laugh
And the people start to stare thinking
Them kids are in a funny way
But we're all in need
Lookin' to see the Carolina day

**And Carolina day don't rise in the morning
Don't set in the evenin'
It ain't that way
Look up in the morning
And you got a grin
And you're with a girl
And you want to stay
Then my friend you're in a Carolina day
Oh, oh, it's a Carolina day

Alec and Brent they're lovin' their child
And James is becoming a star
Sister Kate's laughin' all the time
And my brother Hugh's out wreckin' a car
And my mother smiles thinkin' isn't it fine
That the children are home again
And Louis, my best friend falls on by
And we're all together again

** repeat
*repeat

Oh, it's a Carolina day
Zippin' on down to the C.C. house
Thought I'd put my father on
Then smokes then booze then tokes then Herc
And my head were dead and gone
And Doctor Schein a lot of money and time
And a few friends stickin' around
While taking care of business I found my Carolina day
Didn't let me down

**repeat
