Hey, hey, hey

Well there's a lone wolf out on the prowl tonight
Lurkin' in the shadows, always out of sight

I said, little girl, don't you hesitate, cause you're usin' live bait
Senorita, solitaire, you got a certain kind of savoir-faire

Cause you're notorious (notorious), everything you want,
everything you need
Cause you're notorious (notorious), every mother's nightmare,
Every schoolboy's dream

Everybody by name, every trick in the book
Everywhere that she goes she gets those dirty looks

I said, little girl, don't you hesitate, cause you're usin' live bait
Senorita, solitaire, you got a certain kind of savoir-faire

Cause you're notorious (notorious), everything you want,
everything you need
Cause you're notorious (notorious), every mother's nightmare
Every schoolboy's dream

Lock me up, I want to be your prisoner
Lock me up, I want to be your slave

I said, little girl, don't you hesitate cause you're usin' live bait
Senorita, solitaire, you got a certain kind of savoir-faire

Cause you're notorious (notorious), everything you want,
everything you need
Cause you're notorious (notorious), every mother's nightmare
Every schoolboy's dream

Cause you're notorious (notorious), everything I want,
everything I need
Cause you're notorious (notorious), every mother's nightmare
Every schoolboy's dream

Every schoolboy's dream, oh yeah

Lock me up
