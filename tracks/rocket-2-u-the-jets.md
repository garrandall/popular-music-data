Baby, baby, when you called me on the phone today
You sounded frantic when you said "Come over, right away"
Oh, baby, baby, won't you say what's on your mind?

Your TV set is acting up and you don't understand
You're so upset because you can't watch "All My Children" and
You wonder if there's something I can do for you

Well, all that I can say...

Baby, I can rocket 2 u
Honey, the only thing I can do
Baby, I can rocket all night (rock the night away)
One thing I know I can do (I can rocket 2 u!)

Don't call me when your car just won't go into second gear
Or when your kitchen sink is shooting water in your ear
Oh, baby, baby, I have told you this before

Is there a special reason that you just can't understand
I'm not the one to call when you need a handy man
Unless whatever needs fixing, girl, is you

And I just have to say...

Baby, I can rocket 2 u (I can rocket 2 u)
Honey, the only thing I can do
Baby, I can rocket all night (rock the night away)
One thing I know I can do (I can rocket 2 u!)

Don't call me when your toaster won't pop up
Don't call me just to cut your lawn
Don't call me when your radio cuts off
In the middle of your favorite song
Don't call me when your shower just went (bubbly sound)
Uh-uh, no, baby, don't call me
I think I told you this about a million times
You know, it's not my cup of tea

I can rocket 2 u
The only thing I can do
I can rocket all night

I can rocket 2 u, baby
Let me rocket 2 ya, oh yeah
Just a little bit more

Baby, I can rocket 2 u (I can rocket 2 u)
Honey, the only thing I can do
Baby, I can rocket all night (it's all that I can say)
One thing I know I can do (that's all that I can do)

Baby, I can rocket 2 u (I can rocket)
Honey, the only thing I can do (it's all that I can do)
Baby, I can rocket all night
One thing I know I can do (baby, I can rocket 2 u)

Baby, I can rocket 2 u
Honey, the only thing I can do
Baby, I can rocket all night
One thing I know I can do
