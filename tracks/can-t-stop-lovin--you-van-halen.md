There's a time and place for everything, for everyone
We can push with all our might, but nothing's gonna come
Oh no, nothing's gonna change
And if I asked you not to try
Oh could you let it be
I wanna hold you and say
We can't throw this all away
Tell me you won't go, you won't go
Do you have to hear me say



I can't stop lovin' you
And no matter what you say or do
You know my heart is true, oh
I can't stop lovin' you



You can change your friends, your place in life
You can change your mind
We can change the things we say
And do it anytime
Oh no, but I think you'll find
That when you look inside your heart
Oh baby, I'll be there
Hold on
I'm holding on
Baby, just come on, come on, come on
I just wanna hear you say



Oh, I'm twisted and tied
And all I can remember
Is how hard we tried
Only to surrender
And when it's over
I know how it's gonna be
And true love will never die
No, not fade away



And I know what I got to do
Hey Ray, what you said is true
I can't stop lovin' you, oh
Oh, I can't stop lovin' you
