Now the golden sun can see us kiss
Every summer day, we'll love like this

When the bluebirds flown away
In my arms, we'll both remember
All the love we shared today

As we walk along the silvery shore
Vows we make will last forever more

When the summer stars are gone
One more summer will be over
But our love will still go on

When the bluebirds flown away
In my arms, we'll both remember
All the love we shared today
All the love we shared today
