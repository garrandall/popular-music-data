When I was just a girl
Papa told me
"Baby, you're gonna make it big one day"
I know you'll do it
Keep sticking to it

Just don't let anything get in your way
I'm searching for a star above
It's all I've been dreaming of
Hey listen, world
To what I have to say


One day
I am gonna make it
Make it
Make it to the top

Watch out, I am gonna make it
There's no way I'll ever stop


Oh, I feel it
Don't need a sermon
Cause I'm determined to take control
Of my own destiny

My soul's on fire with such desire
To show just how good
I can really be
When fate comes knocking at my door

I'll walk right through it
Not knowing what's in store
I'm ready any time




There comes a time
In each one of our lives
When we must finish up
My time is near
I won't let it slip away
Oh, no
Oh, no

Out on the corner
Well, maybe who knows
Just what she wants
And knows just what to do

It may be shocking
Soon I'll be rocking
Knowing I've done my best
When I get through

I'm reaching for that star above
It's all I've been dreaming of
Hey listen, world
To what I have to say



I'm gonna make it one day
Make it the top
So watch out
I'm gonna make it one day
No way I'll ever stop

I'm gonna make it one day
Make you all shout
I'm gonna to make it one day
