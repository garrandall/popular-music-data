Let me tell you no
Ooh, baby

Tryna decide, tryna decide
If I really wanna go out tonight
I never used to go out without you
Not sure I remember how to

Gonna be late, gonna be late
But, all my girls gon' have to wait
'Cause I don't know if I like my outfit
I tried everything in my closet

Nothing feels right when I'm not with you
Sick of this dress and these Jimmy Choos
Takin' them off 'cause I feel a fool
Tryna dress up when I'm missing you

I'mma step out of this lingerie
Curl up in a ball with something Hanes
In bed I lay

With nothing but your T-shirt on
With nothing but your T-shirt on

Gotta be strong, gotta be strong
But I'm really hurting now that you're gone
I thought maybe I'd do some shopping
That's right
But I couldn't get past the door

And now I don't know, now I don't know
If I'm ever really gonna let you go
And I couldn't even leave my apartment
I'm stripped-down, torn-up about it

Now nothing feels right when I'm not with you
Sick of this dress and these Jimmy Choos
Takin them off 'cause I feel a fool
Tryna dress up when I'm missing' you

I'mma step out of this lingerie
Curl up in a ball with something Hanes
In bed I lay

With nothing but your T-shirt on
I'm all by myself
With nothing but your T-shirt on

With nothing but your T-shirt on
'Cause I missed you, 'cause I missed you
With nothing but your T-shirt on
Said I missed you, baby

Tryna decide, tryna decide
If I really wanna go out tonight
I couldn't even leave my apartment
I'm stripped-down, torn-up about it

'Cause nothing feels right when I'm not with you
Sick of this dress and these Jimmy Choos
Taking them off 'cause I feel a fool
Tryna dress up when I'm missing you

I'mma step out of this lingerie
Curl up in a ball with something Hanes
In bed I lay

Nothing feels right when I'm not with you
Sick of this dress and these Jimmy Choos
Taking them off 'cause I feel a fool
Tryna dress up when I'm missing you
'Cause I miss you

I'mma step out of this lingerie
Curl up in a ball with something Hanes
I miss you if you do
In bed I lay
I'mma be in bed

With nothing but your T-shirt on
Said I got nothing but your T-shirt on
'Cause I wanna be close to you
With nothing but your T-shirt on
I remember when you would like to see me
With nothing but your T-shirt on

Nothing but your T-shirt on
Let me tell you no
Nothing but your T-shirt on
With nothing but your T-shirt on
Nothing but your T-shirt on
Nothing feels right
With nothing but your T-shirt on
