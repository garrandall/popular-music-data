You need a real love
You need a real love
You need a real love
You need a real love
You need a real love

Our mystery fans
You in lonely shoes
With two hearts a beating
The rhythm and blues

Three doors down
At the end of the hall
Hands in your pockets
Waiting for his call

Girl, you say that you are ready
It's a promise you can taste
You believe you are hungry
For a love that just won't wait

You need a real love
You need a real love
You need a real love
You need a real love
You need a real love

From the unbending night
You have fashioned a new life
Where your moves are like you're
Walking on the sharp edge of a knife

You knock back your feelings
Like you knock back a drink
Oh, you knock back your contest
Then you can think

Then you tell me that you're ready
When I had it up to here
You are standing in the doorway
And you just won't get through here

You need a real love
You need a real love
You need a real love
You need a real love
You need a real love

Hey

Then you tell me that you're ready
When I had it up to here
You are standing in the doorway
And you just won't get through here

You need a real love
You need a real love
Girl, you need a real love
You need a real love
You need a real love
