Street fighting is looking for trouble
If you open your mouth
You're bound to rumble
Johnny looks tough
He's froze in the eyes
He keeps his mouth shut
He don't tell no lies

Johnny went out last night
Got in a bar room fight
Embarrassed a jealous man
In front if his cheating wife
The man said "Tonight you won
But I'll tell you son,
This one's far from over"
Johnny said

Big talk is just talk
Unless, unless you're backing it up
Big talk is cheap talk is
Only words unless you're backing it up
(We're backin' it up)

Now I don't know why
Some men lay down and die
Don't they believe in what they're saying
You should get on your feet
Believe you can't be beat
Remember talk is only playing

Big talk is just talk
Unless, unless you're backing it up
Big talk is cheap talk is
Only words unless you're backing it up
(We're backin' it up)

I remember what my old man used to say
(We're backin' it up)
Never give up and run
(We're backin' it up)
Don't let the talkin' breeze blow you away
Always remember, stick to your guns

Big talk is looking for trouble
If you open your mouth
You better be ready to rumble

Big talk is just talk
Unless, unless you're backing it up
Big talk is cheap talk is
Only words unless you're backing it up, I say

Big talk is just talk
Unless, unless you're backing it up
Big talk is cheap talk is
Only words unless you're backing it up
(We're backin' it up)

We all say
Big talk is just talk
Unless, unless you're backing it up
Oh we're backin' it up
We're backing it up, yeah
