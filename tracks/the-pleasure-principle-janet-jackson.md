You might think I'm crazy but I'm serious
It's better you know now
What I thought was happiness was only part time bliss
You can take a bow
It was all just one big night out on the town
Riding in your limousine
We turned right and I said wrong which brings us to a stop
As the light is changing

Oh my meters running so I got to go now
It's the pleasure principle oh oh ohh
It's the principle of pleasure, ohh
It's the pleasure principle oh oh

It's true you want to build your life on guarantees
Hey, take a ride in a big yellow taxi
I'm not here to feed your insecurities
I wanted you to love me
This has become an all too familiar scene
It's not the first time I paid the fare
Where'd you get the idea of material possession?
Thank you for the ride nowhere

And oh my meters running so I've really got to go 
It's the pleasure principle oh oh, oh hoo
It's the principle of pleasure
Ohh, ah
It's the pleasure principle oh oh, ohh, ah

I know, what you mean to me
Baby this is nowhere
You know what came in between you and me, human differential
Sa dat dit dit dit baby
It's the principle of pleasure
Oh, oh oh oh ah

It's the pleasure principle, principle
Oh oh oh oh, ah

You might say that I'm no good for you
I wouldn't trust your looks, baby, if I could
I got so many things I wanna do, before I'm through
Hey, da dit da dit dat baby

It's the pleasure principle
It's the pleasure principle
Hey hey hey hey, hey hey hey hey

It's the pleasure principle
Baby you can't hold me down
Baby you can't hold me down
After all the love that we've been through
After all you've put me through
Hey hey hey, yeah
Love me, hey yeah, love me, yeah!
Hoo ooh ooh ooh
It's the pleasure principle
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah!
Oh
