Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
This is everything I didn't say


Wait, don’t tell me Heaven is a place on earth
I wish I could rewind all the times that I didn’t show you what you’re really worth
The way you held me, I wish that I had put you first
I was wrong I admit, numb from your kiss
While you were slipping through my fingertips


Taking every breath away
With all of the mistakes I’ve made
From all the letters that I’ve saved
This is everything I didn’t say
I wish I could’ve made you stay
And I’m the only one to blame
I know that it’s a little too late
This is everything I didn’t say
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
This is everything I didn’t say


Wake me up now and tell me this is all a bad dream
All the songs that I wrote
All the wrongs that I hoped
Would erase from your memory
Holding onto a broken and empty heart
Flowers I should’ve bought
All the hours I lost
Wish I could bring it back to the start


Taking every breath away
With all of the mistakes I’ve made
From all the letters that I’ve saved
This is everything I didn't say
I wish I could make you stay
And I'm the only one to blame
I know that it's a little to late
This is everything I didn't say


I hope you know for you I’d sacrifice
To make this right
Woah, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh
Some day I’m sure we’ll pass each other by
Until that time


Taking every breath away
With all of the mistakes I’ve made
From all the letters that I’ve saved
This is everything I didn’t say
I wish I could’ve made you stay
And I’m the only one to blame
I know that it’s a little too late
This is everything I didn’t say
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
This is everything I didn't say
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
