I'm lost without you
Can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you baby?

Tell me how you love me more
And how you think I'm sexy babe
That you don't want nobody else
You don't want this guy
You don't want that guy
You wanna touch yourself when you see me
Tell me how you love my body
And how I make you feel babe
You wanna roll with me
You wanna hold with me
You wanna stay warm and get out of the cold with me

I just love to hear you say it
It makes a man feel good baby
Tell me you depend on me
I need to hear it


I'm lost without you
Can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you baby?

Baby you're the perfect shape
Baby you're the perfect weight
Treat me like my birthday
I want it this way
I want it that way
I want it
Tell me you don't want me to stop (don't stop)
Tell me it would break your heart
That you love me and all my dirty
You wanna roll with me
You wanna hold with me
You wanna make fires and get Norwegian wood with me

I just love to hear you say it
It makes a man feel good baby


I'm lost without you
Can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you baby?

Cause you will tell me every morning
Oh all right baby
Oh yeah
Oh baby
Oh darling
All right right

I'm lost without you!
Can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you baby?
I'm lost without you
Can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you baby?

Oh yeah
Oh baby
Oh darlin'
All right right
Oh baby
Oh darlin'
Oh oh baby
All right right... yeah.
