When Johnny comes marching home again
Hurray, hurrah

Long live our love
Long live our happiness
Here's a toast to happiness
Long live our love

When we were childhood sweethearts
We had made a simple vow
We vowed to love each other
And I know we won't stop now

Long live our love
Long live our happiness
Here's a toast to happiness
Long live our love

But something's come between us
And it's not another girl
But a lot of people need you
There is trouble in the world

It's the fighting that has come between us
And it's taken you far, far away
But please don't wonder if I'll be faithful
You're in my heart both night and day

So, darling, I send my love to you
While you are fighting overseas
And I know one day if we are lucky
God will send you back to me

Long live our love
Long live our happiness
Here's a toast to happiness
Long live our love

Please Lord, don't let anything happen to him, please
I'm waiting for you, Johnny, I'm waiting

Long live our love
Long live our happiness
Here's a toast to happiness
Long live our love

Long live our love
Long live our happiness
Here's a toast to happiness
Long live our love

Long live our love
Long live our happiness
Here's a toast to happiness
Long live our love...
