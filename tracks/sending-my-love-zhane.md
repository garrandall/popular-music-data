If I could mail my heart
Right to you, I would
I'd pack it up, seal it tight
And I'd send it over night

Every time I hear your voice
And I look into your eyes
Sends a burning sweet sensation
Oh, inside of me

The look in your eyes
Has found me
I am sending

Sending my love to you
Praying that you are home
Sealing it with a kiss
Sending my love

Sending my love to you
Praying that you are home
Sealing it with a kiss
Sending my love

With my heart in your hands
I'm as helpless as a baby
I'm in desperate need of your love
So just send it right away

I've been thinking bout you, boy
Because you're so far way
Makes me want to send you all this love
Inside of me

The look in your eyes
Has found me
I am sending

Sending my love to you
Praying that you are home
Sealing it with a kiss Oh, ho
Sending my love

Sending my love to you
Praying that you are home
Sealing it with a kiss With a kiss
Sending my love

If I could mail my heart
Right to you, I would
I'd pack it up, seal it tight
And I'd send it over night
