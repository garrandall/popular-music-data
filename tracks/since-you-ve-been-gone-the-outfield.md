Since you've been gone
There's something I wanna say
Since you've been gone
There's no one taking your place
Since you've been gone
I've just been foolin' around
Since you've been gone
This world's been turned upside down
Didn't think I'd find a girl that I could not forget
Anything we started not so long ago - ain't over yet

Since you've been gone
Staring at your photograph
And I know it won't be long
An' I know you're coming back

You turned me on
Since the first time I set eyes on you
You turned me on
Ooh the things you want me to do
Don't get me wrong
'Cos you're not the only girl I've ever had
But since you've been gone
Girl you know the thought of you's driving me mad
All I do is think of you I lie awake - lie awake
And no matter how I try this loneliness - you know I can't take

Since you've been gone
Staring at your photograph
And I know it won't be long
An' I know you're coming back

Since you've been gone
There's something I wanna say
Since you've been gone
There's no one to stand in my way
Since you've been gone
So scared of losing this time
Since you've been gone
Girl you know that I can't get you out of my mind

Since you've been gone
Staring at your photograph
And I know that I was wrong
An' I know you're coming back
Since you've been gone
Tried my best to read between the lines
If some things are hard to say
You better tell me one more time
Since you've been gone
Since you've been gone
