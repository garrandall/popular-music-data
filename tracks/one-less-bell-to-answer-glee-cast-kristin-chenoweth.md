One less bell to answer
One less egg to fry
One less man to pick up after
I should be happy, but all I do is cry


Cry, cry no more laughter


Oh, I should be happy


Oh, why did she go?


I only know that since he left, my life's so empty
Though I try to forget, it just can't be done
Each time the doorbell rings, I still run


I don't know how in the world to stop thinking of him


I should be happy


'Cause I still love him so
I end each day the way I start out, crying my heart out


I start and end each day crying


One less bell to answer
One less egg to fry
One less man


One less man


To pick up after
No more laughter, no more love
Since he went awaY


Since she went away


Since he went away

Oooh, a chair is still a chair
Even when there's no one sitting there
Well, I'm not meant to live alone
Turn this house into a home
When I climb the stair and turn the key
Oh please, be there, still in love with me


One less bell to answer


Each time the doorbell rings I still run


Will: One less egg to fry


I got one less man


One less man


To pick up after


No more


No more laughter, no more love
Since he went away


Since she went away


Since he went away
All I do is cry
