Used to say it was a passing thing
Didn't mean anything, but we wrong
We used to play it was a harmless touch
It didn't mean that much and we'd be gone

There's a little bit of love going on here
Slipping through the window, scratching at the door

I used to think you were sweet and coy
But like a broken toy you'd be around
I never guessed it when the telephone rang
I'd hear your name, I'm out of breath

There's a little bit of love going on here
Slipping through a daydream, it's longer than the nights
Just a little bit of love going on here
Blowing out the candles, it's turning out the lights
There's a little bit of love
A little bit of love
A little bit of love
Going on here

We used to say that we were just good friends
Only now and then we'd be alone
We just pretend all the restless days
Were just a passing phase and move on

There's a little bit of love going on here
Melting in the sunlight, frozen in the dark
There's a little bit of love
A little bit of love
A little bit of love
Going on here

There's a little bit of love going on here
Darling, Darlin
There's a little bit of love going on here
It's going on right now
There's a little bit of love
Just a little bit of love going on her
Just a little bit of love going on her
