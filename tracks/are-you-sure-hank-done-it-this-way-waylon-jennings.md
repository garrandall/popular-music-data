Lord, it's the same old tune, fiddle and guitar
Where do we take it from here?
Rhinestone suits and new shiny cars
It's been the same way for years
We need to change


Somebody told me when I came to Nashville
"Son, you finally got it made
Old Hank made it here, we're all sure that you will"
But I don't think Hank done it this way, no
I don't think Hank done it this way, okay




Ten years on the road, making one night stands
Speeding my young life away
Tell me one more time just so's I'll understand
Are you sure Hank done it this way?
Did old Hank really do it this way?


Lord, I've seen the world with a five-piece band
Looking at the back side of me
Singing my songs and one of his now and then
But I don't think Hank done 'em this way, no
I don't think Hank done 'em this way
Take it home
