You are here and warm
But I could look away and you'd be gone
'Cause we live in a time
When meaning falls in splinters from our lives
And that's why I've traveled far
'Cause I come so together where you are


Yes, and all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
Fourteen joys and a will to be merry
All of the things that they say are very


Sentimental gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one (All I need is you)
Sentimental gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one

Oh sentimental lady


Yes, and all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
Fourteen joys and a will to be merry
All of the things that they say are very


Sentimental gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one (All I need is you)
Sentimental gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one (All I need is you)


All of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
Fourteen joys and a will to be merry
All of the things that they say are very (All I need is you)

All of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
