Hey, baby
Could you maybe have some love for me?
If you think so then will I know
All my possibilities of loving a stranger
Even though it can endanger


Love's a gamble
For example:
Take a chance on everything you own
Heads you win, but tails you lose
And if our love was even half that strong
We can overcome
And make two strangers become as one
Do you think it would be so hard
(Open up your heart)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh


Hey baby (Hey, baby)
Could you maybe (Could you maybe)
Have some love for me
If you think so (If you think so)
Then will I know (Then will I know)
All my possibilities
Of loving a stranger
Even though it can endanger (Stranger)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
