Don't go breaking my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Oh honey if I get restless
Baby you're not that kind

Don't go breaking my heart
You take the weight off me
Honey when you knocked on my door
I gave you my key

Nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Nobody knows it
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
I gave you my heart
So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart

Nobody told us
'Cause nobody showed us
And now it's up to us babe
I think we can make it

So don't misunderstand me
You put the light in my life
You put the sparks to the flame
I've got your heart in my sights

Nobody knows it
But when I was down
I was your clown
Nobody knows it
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
I gave you my heart
Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart

I gave you my heart

Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my (heart)...
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my
