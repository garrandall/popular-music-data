We wrote on the corner of the table:
"This is the only one that will last
For you, for me, for always
Forever was meant for us", but for us it went by too fast
Don't say you don't remember
I'll never love anyone else
If you say you don't remember
How can I go on living
(How can I go on living)
With myself?
When we meet you always call me "baby."
How could it be that you forgot my name?
Before you go, be honest
I belonged to you and believed that you felt the same
Don't say you don't remember
I'll never love anyone else
If you say you don't remember
How can I go on living
(How can I go on living)
With myself?
People never stay the same forever
Somebody always loves a little more
Tonight I need to love you
Together we'll find a way to make tomorrow worth living for
Don't say you don't remember
I'll never love anyone else
If you say you don't remember
How can I go on living
(How can I go on living)
With myself
