Come on and get my love
Your person, your personal touch
(You know you got it, come give it to me)
Come on and get my love
Your person, your personal touch
(You know I love it)

Everything that you touch in my life
Just turns to gold
This is your love tonight
And forever that I want to hold
No one ever, never love me, baby
The way you do
I want to spend my whole life, sweet darling
Just loving only you, baby

Oh, your loving is so right
And I want it every night
Only you know how to thrill me, boy
You got class and you got style
And your love is worth my while
You satisfy me, boy
Please don't turn me down, oh

Come on and get my love
Your person, your personal touch
(You know you got it, come give it to me)
Oh, come on and get my love
Your person, your personal touch
(You know I love it, come give it to me)

Oh, come on and get my love
Your person, your personal touch
That's the way I feel, baby
(Come give it to me)
Come on and get my love
Your person, your personal touch
(You know I love it)

Yes, it's your love, sweet honey
That I'm living for, mmm
And there's no other lover
That can give me more than you, baby
Anytime you want my loving
You know I'm at your command
Let me fulfill your desires
That I demand, baby

You're so sweet and so unique
And you knock me off my feet
Every time you hug me and you kiss me, boy
I pray you'll always be around
Honey, when my love comes down
'Cause only your love, boy
Sees me heaven-bound, oh, baby, yeah

Get all my love, your personal touch
Come on and get my love
Your person, your personal touch
That's the way I feel, baby
Oh, get my love
Your personal touch
Oh, baby, mmm

Oh-oh-oh, yeah
Oh, your loving is so right
Boy, I want it every night, yeah

Oh, mmm
Get my love
Your personal touch
Ah, baby

Come on and get my love
Your person, your personal touch
(You know you got it, come give it to me)
Give it, give it

Only you know how to thrill me, boy
You got class and you got style
(You know you got it)
Oh, baby
You love is worth my while, yeah, mmm
(You know I love it, come give it to me)
Give it, give it

Come on and get my love
Your person, your personal touch
(You know you got it, come give it to me)
Come on and get my love
Your person, your personal touch
(You know I love it, come give it to me)

Come on and get my love
Your person, your personal touch
(You know you got it, come give it to me)
Come on and get my love
Your person, your personal touch
(You know I love it, come give it to me)
