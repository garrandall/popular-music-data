Oh you remind me, yeah
You remind me of such sweet memories

I saw you before baby
It's a dejavu honey
Don't you know that you remind me

I saw you before baby
It's a dejavu honey
Don't you know that you remind me

You, you remind me of a love that I once knew
Is it a dream or is it dejavu
I just had to let you know so I had to sing it
'Cause for you boy I don't know

The way you walk and the way you talk and
The way you move and you remind me, yes you do
Of the way you dress and the way you dance and
You realy like to move it. You remind me

You remind me
(I saw you before baby, It's a dejavu honey)
(Don't you know that you remind me)
You remind me
(I saw you before baby, It's a dejavu honey)
(Don't you know that you remind me)

You, you remind me of a memory
And this is something you should know
Sweet baby darling c'mon just stop playing with my mind
'Cause for you boy I don't know

(The way)
The way you walk and
(The way)
The way you talk and
(The way)
You realy like to move it
(The way)
The way you dress and
(The way)
The way you dance and
(The way)
You realy like to groove it
You remind me, you remind me

(I saw you before baby, It's a dejavu honey)
You remind me
(Don't you know that you remind me) You Remind me, yes you do
(I saw you before baby, It's a dejavu honey)
(Don't you know that you remind me)

And the way you walk and
The way tou talk and
The way you move it
You remind me, yes you do
The way you dress and
The way you dance and
You realy like to groove it
You remind me, you remind me

(I saw you before baby, It's a dejavu honey)
(Don't you know that you remind me)
(I saw you before baby, It's a dejavu honey)
(Don't you know that you remind me)

I saw you, I saw you before baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
