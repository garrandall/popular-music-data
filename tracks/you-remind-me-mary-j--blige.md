Oooh you remind me, yeah
You remind me of such sweet memories

You know what this is,
You know what I'm sayin?
Check it out

Uh,
Mary J - what's on your brain,
Don't you know you can't diss where you came - from
The motherfucking slum,
You remind me of when you was a bum

Crazy dumb - getting hit in the hallway,
Building 5 - I heard you take it all ways
In the ass and especially the mouth,
You get on the radio and now you're from down south, the Bronx, or Brooklyn
Anywhere but fromÂ 
Sure you know the place that you left your mom...

I'm from the motherfucking Y-O,
Where the niggas is real and the bitches act like they know
You fuckin ho, you know I know
Cause my mutherfucking man Nas told me so

So did Little Jo, Big Coup and Derrick,
Wash from School Street and can't forget Eric.
Ain't you tired of getting hit with dicks
You even fucked my man Charles Oakley from the Knicks

You shouldn't use sex to get away fromÂ 
You got niggas trooping to Fordham Road
Just to drop a load
Bitch you shouldn't have hoe'd
Everybody got your code
The pussy is sold - and your ass and face,
But I asked my man and he said it wasn't all that

Right about the time you were shopping the demo,
He tore your ass up in the back of a limo
And you didn't even care
You left your mom inÂ  - on what WELFARE

Bitch you know you ain't right,
Matter fact what are you doing at about 8 o'clock tonight
You got the boots and I'm coming to get 'em
Is it true that after you fuck 'em, you'll make a record with him
If so then I'll be there and it won't be hard to find me,
Cause like I said before Mary J - You Remind Me!
Yeah
