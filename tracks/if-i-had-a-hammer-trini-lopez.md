Oh, oh oh
Oh, oh oh
Oh

If I had a hammer
I'd hammer in the morning
I'd hammer in the evening
All over this land

I'd hammer out danger
I'd hammer out a warning
I'd hammer about the love between my brothers and my sisters
All, all over this land

Oh, oh oh
Oh, oh oh
Oh, oh

If I had a bell
I'd ring it in the morning
I'd ring it in the evening
All over this land

I'd ring out danger
I'd ring out a warning
I'd ring about the love between my brothers and my sisters
All, all over this land

Oh, oh oh
Oh, oh oh
Oh, oh

If I had a song
I'd sing it in the morning
I'd sing it in the evening
All over this land

I'd sing out danger
I'd sing out a warning, yeah
I'd sing out about the love between my brothers and my sisters
All, all over this land

Oh, oh oh
Oh, oh

Now, I've got a hammer
And I've got a bell
And I've got a song to sing
All over this land

It's the hammer of justice
It's the bell of freedom, yeah
It's the song about the love between my brothers and my sisters
All, all over this land

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

All over this land
Oh, all over this land
Hee, all over this land, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

All over this land
Hee, all over this land
