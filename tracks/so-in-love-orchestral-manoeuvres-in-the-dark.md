Talk to me, don't lie to me
Save your breath

Don't look at me, don't smile at me
Just close your eyes

I was so impressed by you
I was running blind
I would fall for every trick
Every twist of mind


Heaven is cold
Without any soul
It's hard to believe
I was so in love with you


Don't say your prayers, don't build your hopes
Just walk away

Don't phone me up, don't call around
Don't waste your time

You were so in awe of me
You were so divine
You would do just anything
To still be mine


Heaven is cold
Without any soul
It's hard to believe
I was so in love with you


All the things you said to me
I was so obsessed
You were always talking talking
God I did my best


Heaven is cold
Without any soul
It's hard to believe
I was so in love with you
