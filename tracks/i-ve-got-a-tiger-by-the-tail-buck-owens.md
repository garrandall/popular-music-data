I've got a tiger by the tail it's plain to see
I won't be much when you get through with me
Well I'm a losing weight and a turning mighty pale
Looks like I've got a tiger by the tail


Well I thought the day I met you, you were meek as a lamb
Just the kind to fit my dreams and plans
But now the pace we're living takes the wind from my sails
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail


I've got a tiger by the tail it's plain to see
I won't be much when you get through with me
Well I'm a losing weight and a turning mighty pale
Looks like I've got a tiger by the tail


Well every night you drag me where the bright lights are found
There ain't no way to slow you down
Im as 'bout as helpless as a leaf in a gale
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail


I've got a tiger by the tail it's plain to see
I won't be much when you get through with me
Well I'm a losing weight and a turning mighty pale
Looks like I've got a tiger by the tail
