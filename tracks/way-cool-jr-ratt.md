Oh
Oh

New kid in town
Got fancy clothes
Old T-Bird car, baby
And you can tell your nose
He said, "Where is all the action in this town?"

Stop working on the women
It's on real slick
Heard enough about sin, girl
Gonna make it stick
Hey! What makes him so special anyhow?

She said, "So good lookin', that's a fact
Steel guitars run across his back"
The girls all know he's Way Cool Jr.

Check him out on his good side

Heard he came from Memphis
Somewhere down south
Started hangin' with the blues crowd
That's how he got that crazy sound
What is all this talkin' goin' round?

She said, "So good lookin', turns me on"
Out all night, keeps me up 'til dawn"
The girls all know he's Way Cool Jr.

You know you can't have fire without the flame
Can't keep the fortune without the pain
That's how he makes it when he's on his own

Way Cool Jr.
You don't live it up or never live it down
Way Cool Jr.
He's the hottest thing to ever hit this town

Go man go

She said, "So good lookin' and that's a fact
Steel guitar scratched off the back"
Everybody knows it's Way Cool Jr.

You know you can't have fire without the flame
Can't keep the fortune without the pain
That's how he makes it when he's on his own

Way Cool Jr.
Always comin' 'round the bend
Way Cool Jr.
He's gonna live it up or never live it down
Way Cool Jr.

Way Cool Jr.
