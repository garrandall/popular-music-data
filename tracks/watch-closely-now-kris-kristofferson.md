Watch closely now
Are you watching me now
Your eyes are like fingers
They're touchinq my body
And arousing my soul
Riding the passion arising inside me
How high, can I go?
You're comin' with me girl, I'm gonna show you how
When it's scary, don't look down

Watch closely now
Are you watching me now?
I see the hunger arise in your eyes
And it's urging me on
Higher and harder and faster and farther
Than I've ever gone
You're coming closer lady;
Don'tcha leave me now
We're gonna make it
Don't look down

Maybe I'm takin' me too many chances
With no net at all
Maybe I'll teach you at least that you've
Got to be free when you fall

Watch closely now
Are you watching me now?
I'm the master magician
Who's setting you free
From the lies you've been told
When they're breaking your back
Bring your last straw to me
I turn straw into gold
I'm gonna need you later
When you're not around
But I can take it
Don't look down

Watch closely now
Are you watching me now?
