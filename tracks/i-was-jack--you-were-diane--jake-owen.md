It was yesterday, it was years ago
We were singing every word on the radio
Kinda like them songs could save our souls
Somehow, someway

We was falling fast, we was jumping in
Blue jean halo hanging off a limb
Two American kids just like them
Every time it'd play
It blew us away

Do you turn it up, do you sing along
Every time you hear that song
Like we did then, like we did when
Do you close your eyes, does it make you laugh
Do the memories take you back
To 6 packs and a Chevy Cheyenne
Way back when I was Jack and you were Diane

Yeah, and the music played

Yeah we were never growing up or growing old
Breaking up or letting go
Girl just like rock 'n' roll, where's it gone
But I hope like hell every now and again
I blow across your mind like that summer wind
And you're holding on to sixteen long as you can
Every time that it comes on

Do you turn it up, do you sing along
Every time you hear that song
Like we did then, like we did when
Do you close your eyes, does it make you laugh
Do the memories take you back
To 6 packs and a Chevy Cheyenne
Way back when I was Jack and you were Diane

Oh yeah

Do you turn it up, do you sing along
Every time you hear that song
Does it still move ya, baby hallelujah
Do you close your eyes, does it make you laugh
Do the memories take you back
To 6 packs and a Chevy Cheyenne
Way back when I was Jack and you were Diane

Yeah way back
Way on back
When I was Jack and you were Diane
Yeah do you close your eyes
Does it make you laugh
When I was Jack and you were Diane
Yeah do the memories take you back
Take you back, take you back
