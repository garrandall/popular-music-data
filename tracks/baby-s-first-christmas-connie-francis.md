It's baby's first Christmas
It's somethin' to see
Mommy and Daddy
Trimmin' baby's Christmas tree
Baby's big brother
Is busy with his toys
He's shinin' up the chimney
For Santa Claus!

It's baby's first Christmas
And oh, what a joy
Shopping all around
For every pretty toy
It's a very special Christmas
A blessing from above

It's baby's first Christmas
A Christmas full of love!

It's baby's first Christmas
And oh, what a joy
Shopping all around
For every pretty toy
It's a very special Christmas
A blessing from above
It's baby's first Christmas
A Christmas full of love!
