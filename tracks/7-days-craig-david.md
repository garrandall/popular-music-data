On my way to see my friends
Who lived a couple blocks away from me (owh)
As I walked through the subway
It must have been about quarter past three
In front of me
Stood a beautiful honey with a beautiful body
She asked me for the time
I said it'd cost her name
A six digit number and a date with me tomorrow at nine

Did she decline? No
Didn't she mind? I don't think so
Was it for real? Damn sure
What was the deal? A pretty girl aged twenty-four
So was she keen? She couldn't wait
Cinnamon queen? let me update
What did she say? She said she'd love to
Rendezvous
She asked me what we were gonna do
Said we'd start with a bottle of moet for two

Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday
We chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday
We chilled on Sunday

Nine was the time
Cos I'll be getting mine
And she was looking fine
Smooth talker
She told me
She'd love to unfold me all night long
OhI loved the way she kicked it
From the front to back she flipped
(Back she flipped it, ohthe way she kicked it)
And I oh oh I yeah
Hope that she'd care
Cos I'm a man who'll always be there

Ohyeah
I'm not a man to play around baby
Ohyeah
Cos a one night stand isn't really fair
From the first impression girl hm you don't seem to be like that
Cos there's no need to chat for there'll be plenty time for that
From the subway to my home
Endless ringing of my phone
When your feeling all alone
All you gotta do
Is just call me call me

Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday
We chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday
We chilled on Sunday

(Break it down, uh break it down)
Since I met this special lady
Ohyeah
I can't get her off my mind
She's one of a kind
And I ain't about to deny it
It's a special kinda thing
With you-oh

Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday
We chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday
We chilled on Sunday
