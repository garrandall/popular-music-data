(Chorus)
I'm gonna get my drink on, I wanna hear me a sad song. My baby just left home, I didn't treat her right. Right here's where
I belong, I'm gonna stay 'till the money's gone. If it takes me all night long, I'm gonna get my drink on.

Well I got some little problems and the only way to solve 'em is the sure-fire way I know. And when the going gets tough,
Well the tough get going to the little bar down the road.

(Chorus)
I'm gonna get my drink on, I wanna hear me a sad song. My baby just left home, I didn't treat her right. Right here's where
I belong, I'm gonna stay 'till the money's gone. If it takes me all night long, I'm gonna get my drink on.

There's a cold bar stool for a hot-headed fool, and I'm gonna hop right to it. Or a seat a table with a jug of black label
When a 12-pack won't quite do.

(Chorus)
I'm gonna get my drink on, I wanna hear me a sad song. My baby just left home, I didn't treat her right. Right here's where
I belong, I'm gonna stay 'till the money's gone. If it takes me all night long, I'm gonna get my drink on.

Well Jo the bartender, she's a mighty good friender and she likes my company. When she says "last call for alcohol" that
Won't apply much to me.

(Chorus)
I'm gonna get my drink on, I wanna hear me a sad song. My baby just left home, I didn't treat her right. Right here's where
I belong, I'm gonna stay 'till the money's gone. If it takes me all night long, I'm gonna get my drink on.

If it takes me all night long I'm gonna get my drink on. Drink on, Yeah.
I'm gonna get my drink on
