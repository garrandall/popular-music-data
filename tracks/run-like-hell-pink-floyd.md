Run, run, run, run 
You better make your face up in
Your favourite disguise
With your button down lips and your
Roller blind eyes
With your empty smile
And your hungry heart
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past
With your nerves in tatters
As the cockleshell shatters
And the hammers batter
Down your door
You better run

Run, run, run, run 
You better run all day
And run all night
And keep your dirty feelings
Deep inside. And if you're
Takin' your girlfriend
Out tonight
You better park the car
Well out of sight
'Cause if they catch you in the back seat
Trying to pick her locks
They're gonna send you back to mother
In a cardboard box
You better run
