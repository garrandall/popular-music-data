Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Ah yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah (Ah yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah, yeah
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah, yeah


They can say whatever, I'mma do whatever
No pain is forever, yup! You know this
Tougher than a lion, ain't gon' need to try it
I live where the sky ends, yup! You know this
Never lying, truth-teller
That Rihanna reign just won't let up
All-black on, blacked-out shades, blacked-out Maybach
I'mma rock this shit like fashion, as in going til they say stop
And my, runway never looked so clear, but the hottest bitch in heels right here
No fear, and while you're getting your cry on, I'm getting my fly on
Sincere, I see you aiming at my pedestal, I better let you know

That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yea, yea, yea, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yea, yea, yea, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yea, yea, yea, I'm so hard
So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard
Yea, yea, yea, (that Rihanna reign just don't let up)
Yea, yea, yea, (that Rihanna reign just don't let up)
Yea, yea, yea, (that Rihanna reign just don't let up)
So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard

All up on it, know you want to clone it
Ain't like me, that chick too phony
Ride this beat, beat, beat like a pony
Meet me at the top, top, top, getting lonely
Who think they test me now, run through your town
I shut it down. Brilliant, resilient, fan mail from 27 million
And I want it all, it's gonna take more than that
Hope that ain't all you got, I need it all
The money, the fame, the cars, the clothes
I can't just let you run up on me like that, all on me like that
Yeah, I see you aiming at my pedestal, so I think I gotta let you know

That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yea, yea, yea, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yea, yea, yea, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yea, yea, yea, I'm so hard
So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard


Go hard or go home, back to your residence
Soon as the Red Dogs give the block back to the presidents
I used to run my whole block like Obama and them
You ain't gotta believe me - go ask my momma and them
Couldn't even come in my room, smelled like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playing casino
Count the style I keep in my bag, they can't afford it
Tell 'em "give me back my swag!" - they trying to clone it
See my Louis chucks, Louis flag, Louis frames, Louis belt
What that make me, "Louis Mane"?
I'm in the all-white party wearing all black
With my new black watch, call it the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, Carti'ac a wrist
Yeah, they say they hard, they ain't hard as this
Hard: the one word describes me
If I wasn't doing this, you know where I'd be


Where them girls talking trash?
Where them girls talking trash?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where them bloggers at?
Where them bloggers at?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where your lighters at?
Where your lighters at?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?

So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard

That I, I, I, I'm so hard
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard

That I, I, I
