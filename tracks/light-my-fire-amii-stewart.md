You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Baby, we couldn't get much higher

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

The time for hesitation's through
No time to wallow in the mire
Try now we could only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Baby, we couldn't get much higher

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

The time for hesitation's through
There's no time to wallow in the mire
Try now 'cause we could only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

One-three-seven disco heaven
One-three-seven disco heaven
Disco, disco heaven
One-three-seven disco heaven
One-three-seven disco heaven
Disco, disco heaven
One-three-seven disco heaven
One-three-seven

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

The time for hesitation's through
There's no time to wallow in the mire
Try now 'cause we could only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

(Come on, baby, light my fire)
(Try to set the night on fire) Light my fire
(Come on, baby, light my fire) Come on, baby
(Try to set the night on fire) Light my fire
(Come on, baby, light my fire) Come on, baby
(Try to set the night on fire) Come on, baby, light my fire
(Come on, baby, light my fire) Come on, baby, light my fire
(Try to set the night on fire) Light my fire
(Come on, baby, light my fire) Light my fire
(Try to set the night on fire) Light my fire
(Come on, baby, light my fire) Light my fire
(Try to set the night on fire)

Come on and light, you better light
Throw me the light, come on and light
(Come on, baby, light my fire)
Oh light (try to set the night on fire)
You better light (come on, baby, light my fire)
Come on and light (try to set the night on fire)
Throw me the light (come on, baby, light my fire)
Come on and light (try to set the night on fire)
You better light (come on, baby, light my fire)
Come on and light (try to set the night on fire)
Throw me the light (come on, baby, light my fire)
Oh light (try to set the night on fire)
