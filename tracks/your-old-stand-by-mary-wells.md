She left you last night
And today you called me on the phone
Asked me if you could come over
'Cause you didn't want to be alone
So you want me to stand in for her
And be the love of your next act
But this time I play the part so well
There'll be no need for her coming back, 'cause


You know that I'm your old stand-by
You know that you can call on me
I know the part so well that you can hardly tell
That she's left you in misery


I know you only called me 'cause you needed company
'Cause once again she's left you and your heart's in misery, but


You know that I'm your old stand-by
You know that you can call on me
I know the part so well that you can hardly tell
That she's left you in misery
I don't wanna be your old stand-by
I wanna be with you permanently
I'm gonna play the part from the depths of my heart
And you won't need nobody but me
