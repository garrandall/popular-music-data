I can't wait
How will I love you
I can't wait, I can't wait


Sometime she talks to him
Sometimes while she's only dreaming
Then when she wakes up
Somehow she still believes him


Yes, I know you
Though we've been out of touch
Yes, I know you
To be continued, it's too much, well


I can't wait, I can't wait
Well, if I'm wasting my time while you make up your mind, well
I can't wait, I can't wait
And I've got to know when I can see you again, well
I can't wait, I can't wait
Yes, I know you
Though we've been out of touch
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait
What can I do when I'm crazy for you


She wonders how many more hours
Her heart will feel broken
In secret she says she needs to see him
But no words are spoken


Well, she dances around in a circle
Well, she's got that feeling now
Blame it on something at first sight
Put the blame on me if you want to
To be continued


I can't wait, I can't wait
If I'm wasting my time while you make up your mind, now baby
I can't wait, I can't wait
And I've got to know when I can see you again, well
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait
What can I do when I'm crazy for you, baby
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait
If I'm wasting my time, make up your mind, baby

How will I love you
How will I love you


I can't wait, I can't wait
If I'm wasting my time while you make up your mind, baby
I can't wait, I can't wait
And I've got to know when I can see you again, well
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait
Wasting my time while you make up your mind, baby
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait
How will I love you
How will I love you
