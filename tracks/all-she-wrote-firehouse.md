Bye-bye baby bye-bye
And that was all she wrote

I got home late on a Saturday night
And I knew right away something wasn't right
I knew she was gone
She took all I had, but left a hole in my heart
Should've known it'd go bad right from the start
What did I do wrong

I can't understand why she would leave me this way
With nothing to say
Then I found the note on the door
It said good-bye and she don't want me no more

Bye-bye baby, bye-bye she said in the letter
And that was all she wrote
Guess this is good-bye, guess this is forever
And that was all she wrote

I called on the phone but she wasn't there
Should've known all along that she just didn't care
Why did she have to go
Now I look at her picture and I wonder why
She left me this way - why did she say good-bye
I guess I'll never know

I can't understand why she would leave me this way
With nothing to say
I remember the note on the door
It said good-bye and she don't want me no more

Bye-bye baby, bye-bye she said in the letter
And that was all she wrote
Guess this is good-bye, guess this is forever
And that was all she wrote
