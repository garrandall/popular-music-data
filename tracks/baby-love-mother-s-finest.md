There is no other to compare to you
You've got me blinded, givin' all that I have to you
You showed me feelings that I'd never find
But those feelings ain't complete when you're not here all the time

Oh baby love, oh baby love
Early in the morning, early in the morning
You come creepin' in my mind
Oh baby love, oh baby love

Oh baby love, oh baby love
I wake up with a yearning
Burnin' for your touch, oh baby love

Give me reasons to be a fool for you
But I don't care about foolish pride when it's concerning to you
I'll be your slave, yes I will, give me your command
You can order me to stay around you all that I can

Oh baby love, oh baby love
Early in the morning, early in the morning
You come creepin' in my mind
Oh baby love, oh baby love

Oh baby love, oh baby love
I wake up with a yearning
Burnin' for your touch, I'm burning
Burnin' for your touch, I'm burning
Burnin' for your touch, oh baby love, oh

All I do is think about you, baby love
All I do is think about you, baby love
I want your love, I need your love, I want your love
Come on now, oh babe
Hey

There is no other to compare to you
You've got me blinded, blinded, blinded, giving all I have to you
Feelings, feelings I'd never find
But those feelings ain't complete when you're not here all the time

Oh baby love, baby love
Early in the morning, early in the morning
You come creepin' in my mind
Oh baby love, oh baby love

Oh baby love, oh baby love
I wake up with a yearning
Burnin' for your touch, oh baby love

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Shoop dub dooby dub shoop, baby love

Burnin' for your touch, I love you
Burnin' for your touch, I need you
Burnin' for your touch, oh baby love, baby love
Burnin' for your touch, I love you
Burnin' for your touch, I need you
Burnin' for your touch, oh baby love

Burnin' for your touch, I walked a millions miles
Burnin' for your touch, on the milky way, yeah
Just to get into your arms, baby love
Burnin' for your touch, oh baby love

Burnin' for your touch, I love you
Burnin' for your touch, I need you
Burnin' for your touch, oh baby love

Burnin' for your touch, oh baby
Burnin' for your touch, oh baby
Burnin' for your touch, oh baby love

Burnin' for your touch, I walked a millions miles
Burnin' for your touch, on the milky way, yeah
Just to get into your arms
Burnin' for your touch, oh baby love

Burnin' for your touch, I'm burnin'
Burnin' for your touch, I'm burnin'
Burnin' for your touch, oh baby love

Burnin' for your touch, I need your love
Burnin' for your touch, I want your love
Burnin' for your touch, oh baby love
