(It seems so far)

(Six o'clock)


By the time I get to Phoenix she'll be risin'
She'll find the note I left hanging on her door
She'll laugh when she (ha ha ha ha) reads the part
That says (I'm leaving) I'm leavin'
'Cause I've left that girl, so many times before

(Ten o'clock)


By the time I make Albuquerque she'll be workin'
She'll probably stop at lunch and give me a call
But that phone will just keep on ringin' (ringin' ringin' ringin' ringin')
Off the wall (off off off the wall)
Baby that's all (don't you know that's all)

(Twelve o'clock)


By the time I reach Oklahoma she'll be sleepin' (ah)
She'll turn softly and call my name so low (Julius, Bill, John, Phil)
And I know she'll cry (I know she'll cry) to think I'm really leaving her (to think I'm leaving her)
For time and time, I've tried to tell her so
She didn't know (she just didn't want to know)
I'd really go (I'd really go)

Oh baby baby (by the time I get to Phoenix)
I love ya but I'm leavin (baby baby)
(By the time I get to Phoenix) I'm gonna miss your love
But I got to leave ya (baby baby)
(By the time I get to Phoenix) this time
This time I'm leavin, girl (baby baby)
(By the time, by the time) I hate to leave (I)
(Get to Phoenix) but I got to go (baby baby)
(By the time, by the time) I'm going to miss your love (I)
(Get to Phoenix) I'm going to miss your kiss (baby baby)
(By the time, by the time) but I got to leave ya
(I get to Phoenix) baby (baby baby)
(By the time) I love ya (I)
