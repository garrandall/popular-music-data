I just wanna be happy
To love and be loved by you

But the only time I'm happy 
Is when I dream of you each night 
Cause that's the only time 
You hold me tight in my dreams
Is the only time your love is mine.

Each time you're near 
Something happens to my heart 
You make you feel so unwanted dear
And it pains my poor heart
If I could feel your sweet caress 
Then I'd know true happiness.

But the only time I'm happy 
Is when I dream of you each night 
Cause that's the only time
You hold me tight in my dreams 
Is the only time your love is mine.

To me you'll never have 
Nothing kind or sweet to say 
Than my whole day 
To seem too sadly waste away 
But when the day ends 
All my happiness begins.

But the only time I'm happy 
Is when I dream of you each night 
Cause that's the only time 
You hold me tightly in my dreams 
Is the only time your love is mine.

Life pasts each day 
Leaving loneliness in my heart 
You make you feel so unneeded
And it hurts my poor heart
But there's nothing I'd rather do 
Than to be happy loving you.

But the only time I'm happy 
Is when I dream of you each night 
Cause that's the only time 
You hold me tightly in my dreams 
Is the only time your love is mine.
