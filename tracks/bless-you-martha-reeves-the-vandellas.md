Oh this morning when I woke up
Sunshine touched my heart
Children of the earth
They walk so far apart
From this protection
Of what's supposed to be
They don't have it going like
You and me


Oh, and who loves your neighbor
They seem to miss the boat
Letting others drown
So they can stay afloat
But we have love so real
Just let them be
I wanna thank someone
For sendin' you to me


Bless your mother
Bless your father
But most of all


Bless you, bless me
Let our love last for eternity
People will try to break it
'Cause they don't
Wanna see us make it
We'll never let them take it
No, siree


I'd come ride a river
A million miles long
And as long as
We love each other
It's just that strong
If people had a love
To share like we do
They'd know of happiness
I'm finding here in you


Bless you, bless me
Let our love last for eternity
People will try to break it
'Cause they don't
Wanna see us make it
We'll never let them take it
No, siree


Oh, I've got you
And, baby, you got me
I wanna thank someone
For letting us be


Bless your mother
(Bless your mother)
Bless your father
(Bless your father)
But most of all


Bless you, bless me
Let our love last for eternity
We're gonna make it, boy
Heaven won't break it, boy
I wanna shout for joy, it's heavenly

Bless you, bless me
Let our love last for eternity
We're gonna make it, boy
Heaven won't break it, boy
I wanna shout for joy, it's heavenly
Bless you
