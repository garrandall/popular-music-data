Baubles, Bangles, and Beads
Johnny Mathis
Written by Robert Wright and George Forrest based on a theme by Aleksandre Borodin
This version did not chart but
In 1953, Peggy Lee took it to # 30 and
In 1958 The Kirby Stone Four took a peppier "doo wop" version to # 25
Introduced in the musical "Kismet" by Doretta Morrow
Baubles, bangles, jing, jinga-linga
Baubles, bangles, bright shiny beads
Sparkles, spangles, her heart will sing, singa-linga
Wearing baubles, bangles and beads
She'll glitter and gleam so
Make somebody dream so that
Some day I may buy her a ring, ringa-linga
I've heard that's where it leads
Wearing baubles, bangles, and beads
She'll glitter and gleam so
Make somebody dream so that
Some day I may buy her a ring, ringa-linga
I've heard that's where it leads
Wearing baubles, bangles, and beads
