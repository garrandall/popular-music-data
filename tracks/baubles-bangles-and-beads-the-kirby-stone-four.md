Baubles, bangles, jing, jinga-linga
Baubles, bangles, bright shiny beads
Sparkles, spangles, her heart will sing, singa-linga
Wearing baubles, bangles and beads
She'll glitter and gleam so
Make somebody dream so that
Some day I may buy her a ring, ringa-linga
I've heard that's where it leads
Wearing baubles, bangles, and beads
She'll glitter and gleam so
Make somebody dream so that
Some day I may buy her a ring, ringa-linga
I've heard that's where it leads
Wearing baubles, bangles, and beads
