Little red rented rowboat little red rented rowboat
Not much better than no boat
But at least it will go when I row row row at least it will go when I row

I saw two pretty girls sunbathing on a pier
They wore jeans way down to here
I waved, they waved, they said they'd like a ride
So I helped them climb inside to share my


(Row row row row row)
Along came a sailboat big enough for two
The skipper saw the girls I knew what he would do
He waved, and they waved, then he helped them inside
Just one girl to ride there in my


(Row row row row row)
Hot-rod motorboat roared up behind
The girl took a look and I could read her mind
She waved, and he waved, he helped her climb inside
Leaving me with wounded pride
(Row row row row row)
One hour later I saw them again
Motorboat out of gas, sailboat out of wind
The girls waved, and I waved, and then I passed them by
With my nose held way up high me and my



Row, row, row your boat
