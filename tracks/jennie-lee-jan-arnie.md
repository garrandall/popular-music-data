Many a girl I met or knew
Oh what a thing to try for you
Her name was sweet called Jennie Lee
Her heart was true and just for me
Oh Jennie oh Jennie
Oh Jennie oh Jennie

I met her just a year ago
My love for her will grow and grow
Her makes a fire in me
I cannot live without Jennie Lee
Oh Jennie
There's no one left to bother me
I'm gonna get married just wait and see
To a sweet little girl named Jennie Lee
Oh Jennie oh Jennie
Oh Jennie Jennie Lee oh Jennie Jennie Lee
