Ay when I give you these keys homeboy don't move my car man
I'm right in the front ya dig?
Don't move my shit man
Whoa whoa baby, what's yo name?


Go girl, it's your birthday
Open wide, I know you're thirsty
Say aah, hey
Say aah
And we don't buy no drinks at the bar
We pop champagne 'cause we got that dough
Let me hear you say aah
If you want me say aah


Pocket full of money, club don't jump 'til I walk inside the doorway
Bottles of that rose
Smelling like Dolce & Gabbana, yeah
Shawty you the baddest and to meet you is an honor
Lil mama, I got a table waiting, what you think about a convo?
And if you like it baby, we can take it to the condo
And if you like the condo, we can move the party to the bedroom
I'ma beat your body like a congo


Since we in the club for now
Might as well get another round
Noticed ain't nothing in your cup
So give it here baby let me fill it up, fill it up


Go girl, it's your birthday
Open wide, I know you're thirsty
Say aah, hey
Say aah
And we don't buy no drinks at the bar
We pop champagne 'cause we got that dough
Let me hear you say aah
If you want me say aah


Shawty dance like a video vixen
Say her man be on that bullshit pimping
Well I retired from the Bull like Pippen
Tryna get you Homer, would you be Marge Simpson?
Whip out front, we can leave like pronto
Maple Leaf dash got you feeling like Toronto
Make your body rise like you puffing on a joint though
Girl, that's only if you want though, you ready?


Since we in the club for now
Might as well get another round
Noticed ain't nothing in your cup
So give it here baby let me fill it up, fill it up


Go girl, it's your birthday
Open wide, I know you're thirsty
Say aah, hey
Say aah
And we don't buy no drinks at the bar
We pop champagne 'cause we got that dough
Let me hear you say aah
If you want me say aah


Hey hey hey hey hey
It's 'loso, you might be too drunk to know so

I make you say aah just like I'm your doctor
All I prescribe is cranberry and vodka
Then I'm tryna kick it, play a little soccer
And bust a couple off, blaka blaka
The Henny in your system
You start drunk textin' and suddenly you miss him
Or even wanna dis him
Then you call ya girl like, "What the hell you gave me?"
She like, "Don't blame me", you better do like Jamie
And blame it on the liquor
He works every time, Patron you my nigga
Know it's somebody birthday well where your ass at?
And girl, I know you thirsty but don't know where your glass at


Go girl, it's your birthday
Open wide, I know you're thirsty
Say aah, hey
Say aah
And we don't buy no drinks at the bar
We pop champagne 'cause we got that dough
Let me hear you say aah
If you want me say aah
Go girl, it's your birthday
Open wide, I know you're thirsty
Say aah, hey
Say aah
And we don't buy no drinks at the bar
We pop champagne 'cause we got that dough
Let me hear you say aah
If you want me say aah
