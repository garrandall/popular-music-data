Go girl like it's my birthday I walk by they looking thirsty and I say bye (bye, bye, bye, bye)

Sexy in the club I know (I know)

This is how it go down everyday and when I walk up in the club they say


Go girl like it's my birthday I walk by they looking thirsty and I say bye (bye, bye, bye, bye)
Go girl like it's my birthday I walk by they looking thirsty and I say bye (bye, bye, bye, bye)


Dance like a video vixen
Said her man be on that bullshit pimpin
Well I retire from the bull like Pippen
Tryin to get you homer would you be Marge Simpson
Whip out front we could leave like pronto
Maple leaf gas got you feelin like Toronto
Make your body rise like your puffin on a joint though
Girl that's only if you want though (you ready)


Since we in the club for now (for now)
Might as well get another round
Notice there ain't nothin in your cup
So get here and baby let me fill it up (fill it up)


Go girl,
It's your birthday
Hold the wine,
I know your thirsty
Say Aah (Aah, Aah, Aah, Aah)
Say Aah (Aah, Aah, Aah, Aah)
We don't buy no drinks at the bar
We pop champagne cause we got that dough
Let me hear you say Aah (Aah, Aah, Aah, Aah)
You want me say Aah (Aah, Aah, Aah, Aah)


I make you say aah just like I'm your doctor
All I prescribe is cranberry and vodka
Then I'm tryna kick it play a lil socca
Then bust a couple off blocka blocka
The henny in your system you start drunk texting and suddenly you miss him
Or even wanna diss him
Then you call your girl like what the hell you gave me
She like don't blame me better do like Jamie
And blame it on the liquor
He works every time patron you my nigga
Know it's somebody birthday
Well where your ass at
And I know you're thirsty but don't know where ya glass at

Hold the wine,
