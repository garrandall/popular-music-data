Graduation, graduation, graduation

High school parties are over
Things won't be the same
The day to grow up finally came

Graduation's here, graduation

Our trips to the ocean
Were so much fun
Remember the games we almost won

Graduation's here

Our senior year and our one big sin
Was the "senior skip" when we were all turned in
The gaudy mischief had to come but now it's gotta go
'Cause graduation's here and we'll soon be on our own

Graduation, graduation, graduation

Now we are walking down the aisle
I'm cryin' inside but I'm tryin' to smile
Goodbye friends, alma mater too

Graduation's here, graduation
Graduation, graduation, graduation
