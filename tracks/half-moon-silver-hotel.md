He owns a big estate, just south of Savannah
And a high rise hotel in downtown Atlanta
Add half the state of Georgia to his name

She'd be set for life in his colonial manner
He laid the world at her feet on a, silver platter
But all I had to offer her, was the moon

And she took the moon over Georgia
She'd rather have a million stars in the sky, than a gold mine

She took the moon over Georgia
When it came down to his world or mine she took, the moon over Georgia

A little country house, in need of expansion
It's far cry from his south Georgia mansion
But we've got our own paradise

Shadows dancin' till dawn, with a full moon shinin'
And those occasional clouds all have a silver lining
There really must be something about, that old yellow light

'Cause she took the moon over Georgia
She'd rather have a million stars in the sky, than a gold mine

Yeah she took the moon over Georgia
When it came down to his world or mine, she took the moon over Georgia
She took the moon over Georgia
