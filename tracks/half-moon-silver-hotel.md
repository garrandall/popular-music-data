Half-moon silver in a summer sky
Stares at the road we travel by
And we are a long, long, long, long way from home
Still, we must be moving one

Seems strangers in a different place
Weary eyed and a wind-blown face
What a long, long, long, long roads it's been
Still, we go as friends

Slow to change, wonder who you are
Lost in the steps of dancing stars
No one knows how long
We will laugh 'til we cry
Heart to heart
Waiting for the break
Of dawn before we part

You to the highland, me to the sea
On different land we have to be
Makes us far, far, far, far away
Love between us here to stay

Late one night when wind is fair
To recreate the time we share
High upon the northern shore
We shall be forevermore

Slow to change, wonder who you are
Lost in the steps of dancing stars
No one knows how long
We will laugh 'til we cry
Heart to heart
Waiting for the break
Of dawn before we part

Half-moon silver in a summer sky
Stares at the road we travel by
And we're a long, long, long, long way from home
Yes, we're a long, long, long, long way from home
Such a long, long, long, long way from home
We're a long, long, long, long way from home
