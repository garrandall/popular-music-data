What do you want
If you don't want money
What do you want
If you don't want gold

Say what you want
And I'll give it to you, darling
Wish you wanted my love, baby

What do you want
If you don't want ermine
What do you want
If you don't want pearls

Say what you want
And I'll give it to you, darling
Wish you wanted my love, baby

Well, I'm offering you
This heart of mine
But all you do is play it cool
What do you want
Oh, boy, you're making a fool of me

One of those days
When you need my kissing
One of those days
When you want me to

Don't turn around
'Cause I'll be missing
Then you'll want my love, baby

Well, I'm offering you a diamond ring
But all you do is turn me down
What do you want
Oh, boy, you're going to town on me

One of those days
When you need my kissing
One of those days
When you want me to

Don't turn around
'Cause I'll be missing
Then you'll want my love, baby

Well, then you want my love, baby
