Didn’t know if I could make it
I tried to hold out
As long as I could

I have to tell you
How I feel
‘Cause I don’t want to be misunderstood


It’s time
That we got together
And prove what love should be

Our love could be like a dream
We would be a fantasy
If only you will just


(Love me)
Love me
I’ll be there for you
(Love me)
Love me
It will be a dream come true

(Love me)
Love me
Happiness is overdue
(Love me)
Love me
The way that I love you


I know you’ve been through
So many changes
With other loves that weren’t there for you

If you let me in your life
I’ll do all that I can
To make this love paradise for two


Someone to share life forever
That’s what I’ll be for you
We’ll leave the whole world behind
This would be reality
If only you will just



(The way that I love you)

Come on, come on
Won’t you love me
(Won’t you love me)
We can leave the whole world
The whole world behind (behind, behind)

Won’t you love me?
(Won’t you love me?)
The way I love you

(The way I love you)
We can leave the whole world
The whole world behind

(Love me)

Oh, oh
I love you, baby
(Love me)
Yeah

(Love me, love me)

I know you’ve been through so much pain
I know you’ve been through so much pain
(Love me)
But we can leave the whole world
The whole world behind

(Love me, love me)
Come on, won’t you love me
Baby, would you love me

(Love me, love me)

Oh, we could leave the whole world
Behind

(Love me, love me)

Behind
La-la-la
Love me, baby (Love me)
