Yes I want you
Yes I want you
I want you for myself
Yes I want you
Yes I want you
I want you for myself
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody else

Yes I want you
Baby you know I want you
More than words can say
Yes I want you
Yes I want you
More than words can say
I can't help it darling
If you made me feel this way

Yes I want you
Yes I want you
I'll tell the whole wide world
Yes I want you
Baby you know I want you
I'll tell the whole wide world
That I love you madly
And you'll always be my girl
