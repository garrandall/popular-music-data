Yea Lies

Look at me now 
Just sittin here by myself
And I think you found someone else
Now I'm gonna have to find 
A way to put the bottle down
And  why canât you see
That Iâm drowning in a pool of misery

Iâm always afraid
That youâre gone
Away from me
Iâm always afraid
That youâre lost in somebody
Iâm always afraid
That youâre gone
Away from me
Iâm always afraid 
That youâre lost

So here I am 
I don't wanna be by myself
And I think youâre fucking someone else
now im gonna have to find a way
To take the knife out of my back
And how could you leave me
Stranded in a closet full of bones

Iâm always afraid
That youâre gone
Away from me
Iâm always afraid
That youâre lost in somebody
Iâm always afraid
That youâre gone
Away from me
Iâm always afraid 
That youâre lost

Maybe you could let me stay
Maybe just for one more day
You could help me stay the same
Maybe things wonât ever change
Maybe we could taste the rain
You could push me out the way

Now I sit here by myself
Think about somebody else
How could you let them take you away from me
Thereâs somebody else
Thereâs somebody else!

Iâm always afraid
That youâre gone
Away from me
Iâm always afraid
That youâre lost in somebody
Iâm always afraid
That youâre gone
Away from me
Iâm always afraid 
That youâre...

Iâm always afraid 

Away From Me
