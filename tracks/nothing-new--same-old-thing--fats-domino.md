The blues is knocking on my door
Just like it did once before
Nothing new, just the same old thing
You got me singing the blues again
The news is all over the town
You got me acting like a town
Nothing new, it's the same old thing
You got me singing the blues again
Telling lies is all you know
You have me believing they were so
Nothing new, just the same old thing
You got me singing the blues again
You build me up, then you let me down
You got my head going 'round and 'round
Nothing new, just the same old thing
You got me singing the blues again
