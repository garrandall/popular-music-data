(There is the girl, there is the face)
(There is the hand, there is the touch)
(There is the love I need so much)

Oh girl, why won't you let me love you
And let your troubled heart be free
A-take heed a-to all my goodness
Take a hold and follow me now listen, baby

Girl, why won't you let me love you
What does it take to make you see (you got to see, baby)
All the precious time you been a-wastin', baby (you been wastin', you been wastin')
You coulda been sharing it with me, sharing it baby

With every ounce of my love
I have in my command
I'm doing the very best I can
To make you understand, whoa, yeah

(There is) and love
(There is) keep the faith, baby
