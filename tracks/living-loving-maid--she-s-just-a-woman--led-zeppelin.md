With a purple umbrella and a fifty cent hat
Living, loving, she's just a woman
Missus cool rides out in her aged Cadillac
Living, loving, she's just a woman


Come on, babe on the roundabout
Ride on the merry-go-round
We all know what your name is
So you better lay your money down


Alimony, alimony, paying your bills
Living, loving, she's just a woman
When your conscience hits, you knock it back with pills
Living, loving, she's just a woman


Come on, babe on the roundabout
Ride on the merry-go-round
We all know what your name is
So you better lay your money down


Telling tall tales of how it used to be
Living, loving, she's just a woman
With the butler and the maid and the servants three
Living, loving, she's just a woman

Nobody hears a single word you say
Living, loving, she's just a woman
But you keep on talking till your dying day
Living, loving, she's just a woman


Come on, babe on the roundabout
Ride on the merry-go-round
We all know what your name is
So you better lay your money down


Living, loving, she's just a woman
Living, living, loving, loving, she's just a woman
Li-li-li-li-live, lo-lo-lo-lo-love, she's just a woman
