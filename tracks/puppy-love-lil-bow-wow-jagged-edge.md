(Oh...)
Je y'all


Yo I'm looking for girls
(Bow Wow)
Girls that can give me puppy love
Ya know?
(He, he yeah)
Yeah it's going down right here
West coast rock on
(Come on)
East coast rock on
(Come on)
Dirty South rock on
Yeah
(Come on, come on, come on)

All young girls beware
This pup's off the chains
I'm gritty little something here
Putting down pain
Since I was six
Running with the pound
It's been going down
I'm city to city, town to town
They running up screaming my name
Running up grabbing my chain
Running up tryna get in the game
I'm like ma don't get it twisted
If we kick it get your bark on
Hope to God you see me again, when I'm grown
Type of playa but it ain't
It just sounds like that
Cause I'm just too young to get down like that
(I agree)
Hit the movies, hit the mall
Then come out with big bags
Next day do lunch then head Six Flags
But it don't mean nothing
We're just having some fun
Even though I may have told you on the ride
You're the on
I'm sorry little shorty
I just gotta take that back
Cause I'm just too young to get down like that
So...


(You can't hear me)
Not a word that I be saying
(Its plain to see)
Girl I just be playing with you
(Girl you and me, see it's just puppy love, oh)
Bark on baby, bark on, bark on




Even if you're three years older than me
And caught yourself noticing me
In my mind, set don't change
I might up my game
But the story that I tell 'em
When I tell it, it remains the same
You wouldn't believe how they be coming at me
Steady, steady tryna throw something at me
Like I'mma get happy
Just because honey got her learner's permit
Can come and scoop me after school
Like I'm supposed to be on it
Naw ain't no sippin' over here
It's Big Pimpin' over here
And I hope that I make myself clear
That when it comes to honeys yo I got to admit
And I ain't tryna get serious till I'm up in my twenties
It's just the paper that I'm after
The drop with the top I'mma cop when I'm able
And that's all that matters
So if I told you something shorty
I'm taking that back
Cause I'm just too young to get down like that
So...



You can't hear me
It's plain to see
Girl you and me
See it's just puppy love, oh
You can't hear me
It's plain to see
Girl you and me
See it's just puppy love
