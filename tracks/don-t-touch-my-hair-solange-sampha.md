Don't touch my hair
When it's the feelings I wear
Don't touch my soul
When it's the rhythm I know
Don't touch my crown
They say the vision I've found
Don't touch what's there
When it's the feelings I wear


They don't understand
What it means to me
Where we chose to go
Where we've been to know
They don't understand
What it means to me
Where we chose to go
Where we've been to know


You know this hair is my shit
Rolled the rod, I gave it time
But this here is mine
You know this hair is my shit
Rolled the rod, I gave it time
But this here is mine


What you say, oh?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?


Don't touch my pride
They say the glory's all mine
Don't test my mouth
They say the truth is my sound


They don't understand
What it means to me
Where we chose to go
Where we've been to know
They don't understand
What it means to me
Where we chose to go
Where we've been to know


You know this hair is my shit
Rolled the rod, I gave it time
But this here is mine
You know this hair is my shit
Rolled the rod, I gave it time
But this here is mine


What you say, oh?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?




What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
What you say to me?
