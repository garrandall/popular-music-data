Now everybody in this neighborhood
All you women better listen good
I know it's just a matter of time
Till one of you steps out of line
All I got is this to say
Simple message to relay
Get out of here and just keep away
Coz this man is mine
This man is mine
This man, this man is mine

I know the women round here recognize something good
Even try to take it if they could
So I'm using every little trick I know
Making sure that he won't go
I put up all my resistance
All you girls you better keep your distance
We don't need no more of your assistance

This man is mine
This man is mine
This man, this man is mine

He got passion burning in his eyes
Steaming up the night
Always makes me realize
What I done was right

This man is mine
This man is mine
This man, this man is mine

(Gonna love him, gonna teach him
I'm gonna tell him..gonna reach him)
