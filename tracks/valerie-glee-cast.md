Well, sometimes I go out by myself and I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture

'Cause since I've come on home, well, my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress
I won't you come on over, stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie, Valerie, Valerie, Valerie?

Did you have to go to jail,
Put your house on up for sale,
Did you get a good lawyer?
I hope you didn't catch a tan,
I hope you find the right man
Who'll fix it for you
Now are you shopping anywhere,
Changed the color of your hair, and are you busy?
And did you have to pay that fine
That you were dodging
All the time are you still dizzy?

Yeah

'Cause since I've come on home, well, my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress
I won't you come on over, stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie, Valerie, Valerie, Valerie?

Well, sometimes I go out by myself and I look across the water
And I think of all the things,
What you're doing and in my head I paint a picture

'Cause since I've come on home, well, my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress
I won't you come on over, stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie, Valerie, Valerie, Valerie?

Yeah Valerie
