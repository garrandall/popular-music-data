Yeah
You know it's funny. Seems every time I try to forget about you, my feelings pull you back in
You know, 'cause I got somebody else and you got somebody else, but you and I both know, what it really is, but still
You know what I'm saying, B?

Ran across a picture you took of me
And it got me thinking
'Bout how it used to be
It was just you and me

Still hear you say you love me
Put no one else above me
But that was back then
Now you're just a memory

If I didn't go away to school
Then where would we be?
Probably still together and somewhere happy
If I'm supposed to be moved on
In a new relationship strong
Then why are you still haunting me?

They say
"If you love something let it go
And if it comes back then that's how you know."
I got to the stop light
Then I made 4 rights
Now I'm back where I started
And you're back in my life

The further I go the closer I get back to you
I say I moved on 'til I'm reminded of you
Can somebody help me?
Help me get out of this circle
Get out of this circle

I drove past your house the other day
I didn't even mean to. I went the wrong way
I ain't seen your mama in a while
When she looked at me, she smiled
And asked me if I'm doing OK

Took everything I had not to bring up your name
And wonder if you came home for the holidays
She asked if I could stay a while
'Cause you had come in town
And you were just five minutes away

If you love something let it go
And if it comes back then that's how you know
(if it comes back, yeah)
I got to the stop light
Then I made 4 rights
Now I'm back where I started
And you're back in my life
(now you're back in my life, baby)

The further I go the closer I get back to you
I say I moved on 'til I'm reminded of you
(said I moved on but you know this ain't the truth, boo)
Can somebody help me?
(can you help me?)
Help me get out of this circle
(out, baby, baby, baby)
Get out of this circle

Now everybody who's listening to this
If you got that person that makes you wonder, "What if?"
Let me hear you say "Yeah" (yeah)
Say "Yeah" (yeah)
Say "Yeah" (yeah)
Whoa yeah (whoa yeah)

If you understand how I feel
Then grab that person now
Don't let 'em know what's real
Let me hear you say "Yeah" (yeah)
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah

If you love something let it go
And if it comes back then that's how you know
(that's how you're gonna know)
I got to the stop light
Then I made 4 rights
(I got turned all around)
Now I'm back where I started
(tryna think all this out)
And you're back in my life
(yes, I am, baby)

The further I go the closer I get back to you
(the further I go the closer you come)
I say I moved on 'til I'm reminded of you
Can somebody help me?
(can somebody help me?)
Help me get out of this circle
Get out of this circle
