We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
But Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground


Smoke on the water
(And fire in the sky)
Smoke on the water


They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race


Smoke on the water
(And fire in the sky)
Smoke on the water




We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling-truck-Stones-thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights, a few old beds
We made a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know I know we'll never forget


Smoke on the water
(And fire in the sky)
Smoke on the water
