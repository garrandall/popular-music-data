Sunshine, lollipops and rainbows
Everything that's wonderful is how I feel when we're together
Brighter than a lucky penny
When you're near the rain clouds disappear, dear
And I feel so fine just to know that you are mine

My life is sunshine, lollipops and rainbows
That's how this refrain goes, so come on, join in everybody

Sunshine, lollipops and rainbows
Everything that's wonderful is sure to come your way
When you're in love to stay

Sunshine, lollipops and rainbows
Everything that's wonderful
Sunshine, lollipops and rainbows
Everything that's wonderful

Sunshine, lollipops and rainbows
Everything that's wonderful is how I feel when we're together
Brighter than a lucky penny
When you're near the rain clouds disappear, dear
And I feel so fine just to know that you are mine

My life is sunshine, lollipops and rainbows
That's how this refrain goes, so come on, join in everybody

Sunshine, lollipops and rainbows
Everything that's wonderful is sure to come your way
When you're in love, when you're in love
And love is here to stay
