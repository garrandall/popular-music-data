You made me love you
I didn't wanna do it
I didn't wanna do it
You made me want you

And all the time you knew it
I guess you always knew it
You made me happy

Sometimes you made me glad
But there were times
You made me feel so bad

You made me sigh for
I didn't wanna tell you
I didn't wanna tell you

I want some love
That's true, yes, I do
'Deed I do, you know I do

Give me, give me what I cry for
You know you got the brand of kisses
That I die for
You know you made me love you

Give me, give me what I cry for
You know you got the brand of kisses
That I die for
You know you made me love you
