A Night... falls, and I'm alone


Skin... yeah, chilled me to the bone


You... turned and you ran, oh yeah


Oh, slipped... right from my hands


Yeah!


Blue on black, tears on a river
Push on a shove, it don't mean much
Joker on jack, match on a fire
Cold on ice, a dead man's touch
Whisper on a scream
Never change a thing
Doesn't bring you back


It's like blue on black

(*K.W.S. Solo*)


Blind... oh, but now I see
Truth... lies and in between


Ohh Wrong...


Can't be undone


(hell naw)


Well it slipped...


From the tip of your tongue...


(C'mon)


Yeah!


Blue on black, tears on a river
Push on a shove, it don't mean much
Joker on jack, match on a fire
Cold on ice, a dead man's touch
Whisper on a scream
Never change a thing
Doesn't bring you back
It's blue on black

(*Brian May Solo*)


Blue on black, tears on a river
Push on a shove, it don't mean much...


Blue on black, tears on a river
Push on a shove, it don't mean much
Joker on jack, match on a fire
Cold on ice, a dead man's touch
Whisper on a scream
Never change a thing
Doesn't bring you back
It's blue on black


Yeah, blue on black
Yeah, it's blue on black
Yeah, blue on black
