Sometimes at the end of the day, another battle won
I sit down, take a look at my life, and all the things that I have done
Even if I had the chance, I wouldn't change a thing

It's for you
It's for you

The world has gone crazy trying to compete
Got my eyes on a better life, but I'm still trying to make ends meet
If I make some head way, just one small step at a time

It's for you
It's for you
Nobody but you

I can hear the rain outside as you turn and touch my face
All the worries of the day are gone without a trace
When I feel my love inside you, everything's allright
And I wish that I could always feel, the way I feel tonight

When I look in the mirror babe, I see these lines of doubt
I can't help wondering what could have been
But I know what's truly, truly mine
And everything I did today, I did with all my heart

For you
Nobody but you

2 o'clock in the morning, you turn and touch my face
All the worries of the day, gone without a trace
When I feel my arms around you, everything's allright
Because only you can make me feel, the way I feel tonight

2 o'clock in the morning babe, you turn and touch my face
All the worries of the day, gone without a trace
When I feel my love inside you, everything's allright
Because only you can make me feel, the way I feel tonight

It's for you
It's for you
