When you look at me, I know you see
a 15 year old, gettin his dough
back and fourth to the studios
hoppin outta limosines, rockin the latest jeans
jordans, fresh, t-shirt, new
and even though these things are true
its hard work and sometimes I just wanna go home and...
tell my girl to braid my hair...


C'mon and braid my hair
back in my hood, feelin good
no worries or no cares
baby, use your hands to make me feel alrite
and take away the stress and drama in my life
while you braid my hair

You may think that I'm complainin
but thats not the case, all I'm sayin
is my body gets weak, my mind gets tired
i need sleep, but I gotta keep travelin on the road
doin these shows, new york to cali
dallas to philly
its the rules of the game, that I chose to play
but sometimes I wanna say
baby won't you braid my hair...


C'mon and braid my hair
back in my hood, feelin good
no worries or no cares
baby, use your hands to make me feel alrite
and take away the stress and drama in my life
while you braid my hair

Sit me down like you love me
do it anyway you want, baby take it slowly
front to back, side to side, criss cross
get creative with it girl do your thang
put it down like you love me
let your fingers do the walkin
and your lips do the talkin in my ear
tell me what I wanna hear
i swear, I can't wait for you to braid my hair...


C'mon and braid my hair
back in my hood, feelin good
no worries or no cares
baby, use your hands to make me feel alrite
and take away the stress and drama in my life
while you braid my hair

Do what you wanna do
baby its up to you
sit me between your legs
girl won't you braid my hair
baby make me feel allright
and make it last all nite
(and take away the stress and drama in my life)
