Tell me something
Why do I always find it hard
Just to get along
Try my best for nothing
Every little thing I do is wrong

Feel it in my brain
Driving me insane
Round and round
The same old tune

Daddy's on the phone
You know you're not alone
Turn that down
And clean up your room

Sons and daughters
(Don't fall in)
In hot water
Sons and daughters
(They don't do)
What they oughta

Tell (tell) you something
Music is the key to set me free
To the beat (on the street) I'm jumping
Forgetting all the things they said 'bout me

Here it comes again
Chugging like a train
Round and round
An impeccable groove

I know it's getting late
But I won't hesitate
Can't slow down
Got to do what I do

Sons and daughters
(Always in)
In hot water

Wasting time
Is a crime in their eyes
But I'm still young
So much time to decide what to do

I don't need confirmation
For my boyhood extrapolation
Though I'm not sure of my direction
I have the groove for my protection

Here it comes again
Chugging like a train
Round and round
An impeccable groove

I know it's getting late
But I won't hesitate
Can't slow down
Got to do what I do

Sons and daughters
(Don't fall in)
In hot water
(When they fall by the way)
Sons and daughters
(They don't do)
What they oughta

Tell me something
Where you staying tonight
Your folks
Have waited up for you
Now they've locked the door
And turned off the light
