You must be a sad, sad girl
(You must be a sad, sad girl)
If you have no one to love

'Cause I'm a sad, sad boy
(Yes he's a sad, sad boy)
Simply 'cause I have no one to love

You know we are two of a kind, hm hm
A sad, sad girl and boy

And I feel like crying
(You know he feels like crying yeah)
Because I have no one to love

Little girl stop your crying
(Little girl stop your crying)
Just because you have no one to love

This happens every day (yes it does)
Maybe love will come my way
To a sad, sad girl and boy
Oh yeah

This happens every day (yes it does)
Maybe love will come my way
To a sad, sad girl and boy
To a sad, sad girl and boy
To a sad, sad girl and boy
