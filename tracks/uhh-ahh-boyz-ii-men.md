Ten, nine, eight, seven, six
Five, four, three, two, one
Injection, follows


Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Mike?
Yes?


The love I have right next to me
Is here and always will be
I'm caressing your body emotionally
As you can feel and will see
Why can't we go all the way to the top
The fullest extreme
The sounds I hear when you're with me
Express the way that you feel, girl
As you say


Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh


In our passion sent we move in close
The love that we share is the same
I can tell when I reach down deep inside
You show it when you call out my name
Squeezing you tight and holding you close
Is all I feel inside
Although I try to hold in my love
It's something that I just can't hide


Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh


The music is low
The lights are dim, there we lie
Passion overflows
With every look in your eyes
Infatuation, lust
And a lot of love
Sweet caresses
Yes, it's food to be true
Unclench my back
Ecstasy fills the air
As you kiss on my neck
And stroke the back of my hair
To hold you tonight
I feel this is, my dear
To grasp, to hold
To rock that place


Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh


Give it to me, baby
I'll rub your back
As you lay here with me, yeah oh
I want you and I need you
Hold on to me, yeah
Right now, baby, oh, oh
And don't go away
Please, baby, stay with me
Oh I can do it to you
The way that nobody else can babe
