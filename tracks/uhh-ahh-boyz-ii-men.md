Uhh
What can I do?
To make you feel secure
Remove all your doubts
So that you'll know for sure that you're the apple of my eye, girl
Fulfillment of my dreams
Time, will show the value
Of just what you mean to me
More precious than silver
More precious than diamond rings or anything that I can give you
It wouldn't mean a thing
If you didn't have my love beside you there to guide you through
Well it is good to know you do

I know just how you feel
Well this time love's for real
In time it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us all will reveal in time

I tell you I love you, but you don't believe it's true
More precious than silver
More precious than diamond rings or anything that I can give you
It wouldn't mean a thing
If you didn't have my love beside you there to guide you through
But it is good to know you do, ahh

I know just how you feel
But this time love's for real
In time it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us will all reveal in time

I know just how you feel
But this time love's for real
In time it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us all will reveal in time

Da da da...
Or anything that I could give you
It wouldn't mean a thing
If you didn't have my love beside you there to guide you through
Well it is good to know you do, ahh

I know just how you feel
But this time love's for real
In time it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us will all reveal in time

I know just how you feel
But this time love's for real
In time it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us will all reveal in time

Oh, that special love in us will all reveal in time
So let your little heart lay down upon me

I know just how you feel
But this time love's for real
In time it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us will all reveal in time
