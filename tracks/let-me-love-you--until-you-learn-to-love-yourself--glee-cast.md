Much as you blame yourself
You canât be blamed for the way that you feel
Had no example of a love
That was even remotely real
How can you understand something that you never had
If you let me I can help you out with all of that

Let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself.
Let me love you
I know your trouble
Donât be afraid, oh, I can help

Let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself.
Let me love you
A heart of numbness
Gets brought to life
Iâll take you there

I can see the pain behind your eyes
Itâs been there for quite awhile
I just wanna be the one to remind you what it is to smile
I would like to show you what true love can really do

Let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself.
Let me love you
I know your trouble
Donât be afraid, oh, I can help

Let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself.
Let me love you
A heart of numbness
Is brought to life
Iâll take you there

Let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself.
Let me love you
I know your trouble
Donât be afraid, oh, I can help
