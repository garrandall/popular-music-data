Can you count, suckers? I say, the future is ours...
If you can count!


She just wanna go down with the moonlight
Me I just wanna go up with the sunrise
She don't wanna get left when its my time
When its my time, my time
Me I'm just tryna get right up in my mind
Baby you might die if you sting me
Like a honey bee you gon' give it all to me
How I'm runnin' with yellow and black jacket
I'm on madness
Baby spread your wings start flapping
(Bzz bzzz bzzz)
Now stop with the buzzin and be quiet
Ima flip the switch put you on silent kinda like a iPhone
I know what you like but I don't like that anxious look in your eye
Gotta silver hoop in my earring
And a mind fulla' paranoid  but okay
Lookin' away from every girl that gets near 
Switch gears, I run out of tears, run out of fears
But bitch I get it in

She just wanna go down with the moonlight
Me I just wanna go up with the sunrise
She don't wanna get left when its my time
When its my time, my time
Me I'm just tryna get right up in my mind
Direction, baby what's ya direction
Direction, I need to know where you headin
Direction, hey babe what's ya direction
Dickre-ction


I remember when I was in addaka
Swine father keep his hoes in pig tails
Pig nasty, Pig jersey get the mail and on my hip I gotta keep a gat-akka
That'll blow your mind like Roger Troutman have ya singing Doo Wa Ditty when its zappin' ya
Gotta second cabin in another different set of woods where I fuck hoes on camera
Wait
I just gotta get one thing straight
I don't care who hates me
I don't care about making mistakes
I pretty much gave birth to all of y'all and that there takes the fucking cake
Get into it do it do it to em dump their stupid bodies in a murky lake
Think you gotta blind date with death-y wait posted at the gate
Rozzy Dyliams woulda been the fifth or sixth William if my momma didn't named me Dylan
If you got an enemy then kill em
Trap and zagged in outer space like Roger Wilco
I be on that horsed sim code generate more sim codes spraying up your zip code but everyday that's a


She just wanna go down with the moonlight
Me I just wanna go up with the sunrise
She don't wanna get left when its my time
When its my time, my time
Me I'm just tryna get right up in my mind
