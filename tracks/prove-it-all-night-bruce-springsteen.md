I've been working real hard, trying to get my hands clean, 
We'll drive that dusty road from Monroe to Angeline,
To buy you a gold ring and pretty dress of blue, 
Baby just one kiss will get these things for you, 
A kiss to seal our fate tonight, 

A kiss to prove it all night. 
Prove it all night, 
Girl there's nothing else that we can do, 
Except prove it all night, prove it all night,
And girl I prove it all night for you.

Everybody's got a hunger, a hunger they can't resist, 
There's so much that you want, you deserve much more than this, 
Well if dreams came true, oh, wouldn't that be nice,
But this ain't no dream we're living off through tonight,
Ah girl, you want it, you take it, you pay the price,

And prove it all night.
Prove it all night,
Prove it all... I've even called the bluff,
We'll prove it all night, prove it all night,
Girl I prove it all night for your love.

Baby, tie your hair back in a long white bow, 
Meet me in the fields, behind the dynamo,
You hear their voices telling you not to go,
They made their choices and they'll never know, 
What it means to steal, to cheat, to lie, 
What it's like to live and die,

And prove it all night.
Prove it all night,
Girl there's nothing else that we can do,
Except prove it all night, prove it all night,
And girl I prove it all night for you.

I prove it all night...
I prove it all night...
I prove it all night...
I prove it all night...
I prove it all night...
I prove it all night...
I prove it all night...
I prove it all night...
