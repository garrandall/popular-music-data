Oh, people gather round me
This is to who it may concern
I'm not tryin' to run your life
But you're never too old to learn
Stop worryin' about your neighbors
And the fancy things they've got
'Cause if you do you'll find it's true
You're gonna wind up on the spot, oh

Don't let the Jones, don't let the Jones
Don't let the Joneses get you down, woo, one more time
Don't let the Jones, don't let the Jones
Don't let the Joneses get you down, whoa, down
Ooh, hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo

Huh, you may not believe it
But nine times out of ten it's true
The people you're tryin' to keep up with
Are tryin' to keep up too
Remember that old sayin'; "All that glitters ain't gold"
Take heed, don't ignore it, and to your money tightly hold, oh

Don't let the Jones, don't let the Jones
Don't let the Joneses get you down whoa, down
(Here me now now)
Don't let the Jones, don't let the Jones
Don't let the Joneses get you down, whoa, down

You're a leader yourself but you don't even know it
You're so busy followin' Joneses you ain't got time to show it
Keeping up with the Joneses, it only makes your life a mess
Bill collectors, tranquilizers, and gettin' deeper in debt

You better leave the Joneses alone
(Tell 'em one more time)
You better leave, oh leave, the Joneses alone, uh-huh

Joneses got a new car today
Here's what you should say; (Hooray for the Joneses)
Instead you worry 'til your whole head turns gray
(Worryin' about the Joneses)
Remember it's their car and they're the ones who had to pay
So leave (boom boom) the Joneses alone
Listen, your car might be old but, remember
It never fails to get you where you want to go

Oh, don't let the Jones, don't let the Jones
Don't let the Joneses get you down, whoa, down
(Here me now now)
Don't let the Jones, don't let the Jones
Don't let the Joneses get you down, whoa, down

(scatting)

You're doing fine
Don't let the Joneses blow your mind

Now listen, if you see somethin' you want
And you know you can't afford it
Well, the very next thing for you to do
Is start saving towards it
The Joneses have been the downfall
Of many a person you see
So, people, take my advice
And let the Joneses be, ow


Don't let the Jones, don't let the Jones
Don't let the Joneses get you down, whoa, down
Don't let the Jones, don't let the Jones
Don't let the Joneses get you down, whoa, down

You're doing fine
Don't let the Joneses blow your mind, woo-hoo
You're doing fine
Don't let the Joneses blow your mind, woo-hoo

(scatting)
