Girl it always seems about September
That's the time, again I remember the lights
And all the fun of those summer nights
Young and innocent and livin' fast
Didn't know enough to know
That a summer love can't last
Can't last

(Do you remember those)
Summer nights all night
Dancin' in the light of love
(Dancin' in the light of love)
Summer nights so right
Couldn't last beyond September
Summer nights all night
Livin' for your love,
Dreamin only of
You and summer nights

I remember playin' by the shoreline
Before the fall when we had it all at our fingertips
Buildin' castles in the driftin' sand
Raced the waves as they ran to the shore
But the tides were turned for ever more
And the things we planned
Were castles made of sand

(Do you remember those)
Summer nights all night
Dancin' in the light of love
(Dancin' in the light of love)
Summer nights so right
Couldn't last beyond September
Summer nights all night
Livin' for your love,
Dreamin only of
You and summer nights

Oh summer nights
We were diamonds in the rough in the moonlight
Oh summer nights
Now I'm out in the cold again
Back on my own again

(Well I remember those)
Summer nights...
