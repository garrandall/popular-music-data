Everybody's been a-talking
They said our love wasn't real
That it would soon be over
That's not the way that I feel

But I don't worry honey
Let them say what they may
Come on and stick with me baby
We'll find a way
Yes, we'll find a way

Everybody's been a-talking
Yes, the news travels fast
They said the fire would stop burning
That the flame couldn't last

But I don't worry honey
Let them say what they may
Come on and stick with me baby
We'll find a way
Yes, we'll find a way

Come on and stick with me baby
Come on and stick with me baby
Come on and stick with me baby
