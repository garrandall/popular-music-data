Oh
Oh yeah
Oh
Girl, you know that

CHORUS
I love to love
I love to love you
Nobody can change my mind
You're one of a kind
I love to love
I love to love you
No one loves me better, it's true

VERSE ONE
Was not so long ago
That I was all alone
I had so much doubt in me
And I had so many dreams
But fear got the best of me
Then came you and you set me free

RISE
So more than you know you're the one
Who really really changed my life (you changed my life)
Now whether I win or lose
I will never be afraid to try
That's why

CHORUS
I love to love
I love to love you
Nobody can change my mind
You're one of a kind
I love to love
I love to love you
No one loves me better, it's true

VERSE TWO
You taught me how to dream
That no goal's beyond my reach
So now I reach for the sky
Love me with honesty
Showed me what the word should mean
Now you're all I need to get by

RISE
So more than you know you're the one
Who really really changed my life (you changed my life)
Now whether I win or lose
I will never be afraid to try
That's why

CHORUS
I love to love
I love to love you
Nobody can change my mind
You're one of a kind
I love to love
I love to love you
No one loves me better, it's true

I love to love
I love to love you
Nobody can change my mind
You're one of a kind
I love to love
I love to love you
No one loves me better, it's true

Oh yeah
Oh
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

I love to love
I love to love you
Nobody can change my mind
You're one of a kind
I love to love
I love to love you
No one loves me better, it's true

I love to love
I love to love you
Nobody can change my mind
You're one of a kind
I love to love
I love to love you
No one loves me better, it's true
