Isabella, isabella 
Don't you turn me down
I've been knockin' on the front door
Of my very own house
Isabella, isabella
Don't treat me like i'm dead and gone
I just want to see my baby daughter
Before her childhood is gone
Isabella, isabella
Let me in the door
Or i'll kick out the window
And spill glass on the floor
Isabella, isabella
Tell me where my daughter is
Tell me how all my love
Could have led to this
Isabella you don't have to love me like you did
Maybe things have fallen for the better
Isabella maybe you're just glad to be rid of me
I hope i'm on your mind
Isabella's on my mind
I can hardly help but think
Of all the damage we have left behind us
Isabella, isabella
Don't you turn me down
I've been knockin' on the front door 
Of my very own house 
Isabella, isabella 
Don't treat me 
Like i'm dead and gone 
I just want to 
My baby daughter 
Before her childhood is gone 
Isabella you don't have to love me like you did 
Maybe things have fallen for the better 
Isabella maybe you're just glad to be rid of me 
I hope i'm on your mind 
Isabella's on my mind 
I can hardly help but think 
Of all the damage we have left behind us 
Isabella, isabella 
I know where you keep your gun
Don't think that i've forgotten
All that you've done
Isabella, isabella
They won't ever find you
Six feet under till the rain and thunder
Finish all that i have left you
Isabella you don't have to love me like you did
Maybe things have fallen for the better
Isabella maybe you're just glad to be rid of me
I hope i'm on your mind
Isabella's on my mind
I can hardly help but think
Of all the damage we have left behind us, isabella
