Listen, listen to my heartbeat
Listen, listen to my heartbeat
Baby, listen
I'm for real this time
Listen to me

Don't let an old acquaintance be forgotten
You see, I can't face this new year without you
You know the last time you left me girl
I had such a pain in my chest I had to go to the doctor and get an x-ray
And when they finished with me you know what they told me?
He said "Johnnie you don't have no heart attack man
What you got is a love attack"


(I don't wanna lose you)
I don't wanna lose you
As a matter of fact
I can't stand to lose you
(I don't wanna lose you)


When I say I love you, yeah
This time, you can believe me
Yes, you can, um
I can't blame you if you wanna leave me, no, no
After all, I'm the one who deceived you
But I'm just here to let you know
Never, ever, will I want to let you go


I don't wanna lose you
Oh, help me say it, somebody
I don't wanna lose you (baby)
Let me, let me, let me say it


You saw me running around with another
But the next time they'll never, no, never
'Cause the love in my heart is so true
No one else will ever do
If you say we're gonna part
Don't you know you're
Gonna break J.T.'s heart


I don't wanna lose you
Oh, the sweet loving you give me
I don't wanna lose you (baby)


Don't let the memory that we shared fade away
Reconsider my new love and devotion
'Cause I can honestly say
My love is real
I'm gonna make you feel it


My love is real
(I don't wanna lose you)
I want you to give it to you
(I don't wanna lose you)
My love is real baby, I want you to have it
(I don't wanna lose you, baby)
I don't wanna lose it, I don't wanna lose it
And if I lose it
