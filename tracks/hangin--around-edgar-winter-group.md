Drivin' along with my radio on feelin' good
Ain't got no lady but maybe I'm thinkin' I could
I slept all day nothing to do
And I don't see the world goin' by
And I don't even have to try
I'm just hangin' around (Oh yeah)

Thought I was cool when I dropped out of school it was great (yeah)
Could have gone crazy but I was too lazy to wait
So I'm drivin' along, all alone
And I don't see the world goin' by
And I don't even have to try
I'm just hangin' round

I'm driving along all alone, yeah
And I don't see the world goin' by
And I don't even have to try
No, I don't see the world going by
And I don't even have to try
I'm just hangin' around

Oooo baby, listen to the people sing now
(Just hangin' around)
That's right I'm just a hang around
(Just hangin' around)
Take it one more time now
(Just hangin' around)
You're in some real bad situation
(Just hangin' around)
I said I don't see the world goin' by
(Just hangin' around)
I said I don't even have to try
(Just hangin' around)
I'm just a, I'm just a hangin' around
(Just hangin' around)
I'm just, just, hangin' around yeah, yeah
(Just hangin' around)
Thought I was so cool, yeah
(Just hangin' around)
