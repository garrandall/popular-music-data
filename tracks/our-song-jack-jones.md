Yeah Yeah
Colt Ford
This is the remix


I'm still county y'all it ain't ever change
I'm still Georgia boy I still rep La Grange
I'm still drinkin' Jim Beam and Jack D (yup)
And that 
And I'll tell you what I'm feeling new again
Call up Colt and Danny like lets do it then
Lets cut the  song and drink the cold beer
Tell them suckers get on I'm in my zone here
I took my city homie snipin' last night
Told them here hold this bag and this flash light
And we gone run them this way just hold tight
Ain't ever got him one but we laughed the whole night
Yeah life it great I can't complain
I entertain sing and do my thing
I just smile when haters say my name
It's Bubba K the whole can't maintain


This is our song everybody sing it
Clap your hands y'all and do it like you mean it
Stand our ground and we don't back down
If you're from a small town and you're never gonna leave it
This is our song everybody sing it
Clap your hands y'all and do it like you mean it
Stand our ground and we don't back down
And if you don't like it then don't come around

Welcome to our neck of the forest
City folks arn't checkin' for us
It's not petty coat junction
It's bug zappers on porches
It's 105 and muggy skin scoarches in the heaters
And nats and helicopter size mosquitos
Try to eat us we need eaters we believe in Jesus
We got a deep seeded respect for those that fought to keep our freedom
We support our folks so I'm burnin' with Colt Ford Bubba and Demun
By the way I'm Danny thats
Athens La Grange Charles County jack
Don't get one in the front and out your back
My people say

This is our song everybody sing it
Clap your hands y'all and do it like you mean it
Stand our ground and we don't back down
If you're from a small town and you're never gonna leave it
This is our song everybody sing it
Clap your hands y'all and do it like you mean it
Stand our ground and we don't back down
And if you don't like it then don't come around


Slap stompin' through the country in my Red Wing Boots
I was raised up in the south where I planted my roots
You know I got to throw it up for people in the back wood
Tailgate down ridin' round like a lac should
No one ever liked a city slicker with a fat mouth
Bring it round here bet you'll get your ass knocked out
Down home boys on this song to make you feel fine
Can't tell make you play some Hick-Hop for me one time

Ol' Colt called me up said he needed some help
I filled my cup in the trunk now I'm flyin' like hell
I ain't ever been rehearsed I don't need no saddle
This is real country talk this ain't American Idol
I made the noise for my boys they workin' so hard
The rednecks checks to checks and the trailer parks
Hick-Hop and body rock and put it up on the wall
Country folks world wide now this all for y'all


This is our song everybody sing it
Clap your hands y'all and do it like you mean it
Stand our ground and we don't back down
If you're from a small town and you're never gonna leave it
This is our song everybody sing it
Clap your hands y'all and do it like you mean it
Stand our ground and we don't back down
And if you don't like it then don't come around


Well looky right here it's like a family reunion
Everybody gather round and take communion
Colt and Bubba K like Snow Man and Bandit
Demun they can't stand it just how we planned it
Lord let the water wash away our sins
 and Danny Demun the Lacs and good friends
'Cause folks from the country ain't afraid of Jack
We drink him and Jim and holla hym
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
And if you get in my face i'm a tear of the place
And leave you layin' in the southern ground


This is our song everybody sing it
Clap your hands y'all and do it like you mean it
Stand our ground and we don't back down
If you're from a small town and you're never gonna leave it
This is our song everybody sing it
Clap your hands y'all and do it like you mean it
Stand our ground and we don't back down
And if you don't like it then don't come around


It's about baggy jeans buckled and Georgia boots
These mud bog tires chrome 22's
'Cause we country folks raised on breakin' rocks
Always got something with the clip in the glove box
The rifles tucked behind the rear seat
If you see a buck duck my wife cooks the deer meat
It's a spectacle you should really come see this
DJ's mixed Outkast with Kenny Chesney
