Our song - we used to call it our song
It helped us say hello once
It made us fall in love once... without knowing
Oh, and how we tried so not to show it
Even though we didn't know it

Our song became a little bit sadder
But it didn't seem to matter
Even when I kissed you... couldn't please you
And then all at once our love was gone
All you left me was our song

Every time I hear that song I could cry
Now we don't belong - we've said our goodbyes
I'm still wondering why with tears in my eyes

Our love started like a song
But the melody went wrong
There's nothing left to do now but forget you
So I'll look around for someone new
Someone who is very lonely too!
And I'll wait for love to come along
Like I did the first time I heard... our song
