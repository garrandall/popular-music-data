Dont be mad, Im not tryin to offend
your shape is captivatin
but I'ma be patient
if I have to I'ma just fall back
aint no need to press the fact that Im
open off your style
your sexy when you walk I aint even heard u talk
if your voice is as fly as ur skin tone
then I alredy kno just wat u sound like wen u moan


I dont wanna be patient dont wanna jump the gun
but I dont want somebody else to scoop you up
but I'ma be patient
baby I wanna see if u feelin me yeah


Girl its plain to see when u get close to me
you make me feel the heat
I never met anyone quite like you baby
extend your love to me let me give you what you need


I dont wanna be patient dont wanna jump the gun
but I dont want somebody else to scoop you up
but I'ma be patient
baby I wanna see if u feelin me yeah


If it takes me a minute
its only coz its lookin like mah dream n u in it
u messed around and gave me the eye now u did it
But I dont wanna see u giv sumbody else ur digits
But baby your body is
Like a sexy nine pearl handle desingn
Thought she was shy she fly pulled me from behind
Baby kinda bonafied cool relax type
pleasures I like in my everyday struggles in life


Aint no holdin back
Good things come to those who wait
Maybe you and I should just motivate
Dont wanna miss you babe
Im still J . B if u pass I'ma do ma damn thing
Im about to let you know
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh OOh Ooh OOh Ooh Ooh yeh
I'ma just let you do your friends
And I'ma get at you later
Or maybe I might not and I might or I might not
yeah huh
