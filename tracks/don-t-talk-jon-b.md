Uh, yeah, come on, baby, now


Baby, I had to stop for a second on the balcony
Scopin' you down, you're lookin' fly to me (You're lookin' fly to me)
All dressed up and buyin' your own drinks
And that ain't right (That ain't right)
Not that you can't handle it on your own (On your own)
But you're too damn fly to drink all alone
Can I come bubble with you?
To you, I'ma make a toast, come on


Don't talk, baby, just move with me
Take a sip, kind of got you feelin' fizzy
It's alright, it's alright with me if it's alright with you
Oh, baby
Don't talk, baby, just move with me
Take a sip, kind of got you feelin' fizzy
It's alright, it's alright with me if it's alright with you
Oh, baby


Baby, you got me high dancin' close with the chronic perfume (The chronic perfume)
Smellin' all good, it's gettin' hot in the room (Hot in the room)
All pressed on you and I know you feel it too (I know you feel it too)
And that's alright (That's alright)
Pardon me, I'ma back up and be a gentleman
And if it's really real then you can tell me when (Tell me, baby)
And that's when she pulled me close and said, "Do it again"
Come on


Don't talk, baby, just move with me
Take a sip, kind of got you feelin' fizzy
It's alright, it's alright with me if it's alright with you
Oh, baby
Don't talk, baby, just move with me
Take a sip, kind of got you feelin' fizzy
It's alright, it's alright with me if it's alright with you
Oh, baby


Oh, come on, baby, now, oh (Yeah, I take it)
Ah, ah, oh
Come on, baby, now, oh (Uh, uh, uh)
Oh (Come on, come on), come on, baby, now, oh
(Shakin' your stuff, when you do, it's like) Oh

(Yeah, yeah, yeah)


Girl (Girl), it's alright to relax your mind (Relax your mind)
(To relax) You came out to enjoy yourself
(It's on you) It's on you and nobody else (And nobody else)
Come on and bubble with me (Bubble with me, baby)


Don't talk, baby, just move with me
Take a sip, kind of got you feelin' fizzy
It's alright, it's alright with me if it's alright with you
Oh, baby

I might be tipsy
But I'm not crazy, baby
And if it's alright with you (Oh, baby)
I might be tipsy
But I ain't crazy, baby
If It's alright with you, oh, baby
I might be tipsy
But I ain't crazy, baby
To want to come home with you
Baby, just tell me what you wanna do
