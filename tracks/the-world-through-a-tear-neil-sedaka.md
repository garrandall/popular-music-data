Grass is green
Like I've never seen
Sky above was never so blue
Now here am I
No one standing near
It's a lonely world
Such a lonely world

The world through a tear
From days gone by
The world through a tear
Too slow to dry
The world through a tear
The tear I cry

Just last year
We wandered here
And dreamed a dream
That never would die
Now only me
Hopin' she'll appear
It's a lonely world
Such a lonely world

The world through a tear
From days gone by
The world through a tear
Too slow to dry
The world through a tear
The tear I cry
