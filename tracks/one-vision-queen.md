God works in mysterious ways
Mysterious ways
Ah...


Hey!
One man, one goal
Ha, one mission
One heart, one soul
Just one solution
One flash of light
Yeah, one god, one vision


One flesh, one bone, one true religion
One voice, one hope, one real decision
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Give me one vision, yeah


No wrong, no right
I'm gonna tell you there's no black and no white
No blood, no stain
All we need is (one worldwide vision)


One flesh, one bone, one true religion
One race, one hope, one real decision
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa-yeah, whoa-yeah, oh yeah!


I had a dream when I was young
A dream of sweet illusion
A glimpse of hope and unity
And visions of one sweet union
But a cold wind blows and a dark rain falls
And in my heart, it shows
Look what they've done to my dream, yeah!

One vision
So give me your hands, give me your hearts
I'm ready! There's only one direction
One world and one nation
Yeah, one vision


No hate, no fight, just excitation
All through the night it's a celebration
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

One flesh, one bone, one true religion
One voice, one hope, one real decision
Give me one night, yeah
Give me one hope, hey
Just give me, ah
One man, one man
One bar, one night
One day, hey, hey
Just gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme fried chicken!
Vision...
