You are the sunshine, baby, whenever you smile
But I call you Stormy today
All of a sudden that ol' rain is fallin' down
And my world is cloudy and gray
You've gone away

Old Stormy Stormy
Old Stormy Stormy
Old Stormy Stormy
Old Stormy Stormy

Yesterday's love was alive, the warm summer breeze
But like the weather you changed
Now things are dreary, baby, windy and cold
And I stand alone in the rain
Callin' out your name

Stormy Stormy
Stormy Stormy
Come back to me Stormy
Stormy Stormy

Bring back that sunny day



Yesterday's love was alive, the warm summer breeze
But like the weather you changed
Now things are dreary, baby, windy and cold
And I stand alone in the rain
Callin' out your name

Whoa! Stormy

Stormy, come back to me Stormy
Stormy, come back to me Stormy

Come on home! Stormy

Bring back that sunny day
