Never had much faith in love or miracles (miracles) uh!
Never wanna put my heart on the line, uh!
But swimming in your water is something spiritual (spiritual) uh!
I'm born again every time you spend the night, uh!

'Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows, yeah, yeah, yeah

'Cause you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long
Yeah you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long, oh

Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah, uh!

You bring me to my knees
You make me testify (testify) uh!
You can make a sinner change his ways, uh!
Open up your gates 'cause I can't wait to see the light, uh!
And right there is where I wanna stay, uh!

'Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows, yeah, yeah, yeah

'Cause you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long
Yeah you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long, oh

Oh oh oh oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can't I just stay here?
Spend the rest of my days here?
Oh oh oh oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can't I just stay here?
Spend the rest of my days here?

For too long, for too long, oh
