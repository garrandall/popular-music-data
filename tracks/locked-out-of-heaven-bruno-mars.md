I never had much faith in love or miracles
I never wanna put my heart on the line
Ooooh but swimming in your water is something spiritual
And Iâm born again every time you spend the night

Which way is right, which way is wrong
How do I say that I need to move on?
And it show-ow-ow-ows
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

You make feel like
I am just too close to love you
Iâve been locked out of heaven
There's nothing I can really say
Yeah yeah

You make feel like
I can't lie no more, I can't hide no more
Got to be true to myself
I am just too close to love you
You make feel like
Iâve been locked out of heaven
So I'll be on my way

You bring me to my knees
You make me testify
You can make a sinner change his ways
You said "open up your gates cause I can't wait to see the light
And right there is where I wanna stay"

Which way is right, which way is wrong
How do I say that I need to move on?
And it show-ow-ow-ows
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

You make feel like
I am just too close to love you
Iâve been locked out of heaven
There's nothing I can really say
Yeah yeah

You make feel like
I can't lie no more, I can't hide no more
Got to be true to myself
I am just too close to love you
You make feel like
Iâve been locked out of heaven
So I'll be on my way

All I need is a beauty and a beat
(I feel a heartbeat)
To make my life complete
Yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
(All I need is a beauty and a beat)
So shame on me now
(To make my life complete)
Flew me to places I'd never been
Yeah

You make feel like
I am just too close to love you
Iâve been locked out of heaven
There's nothing I can really say
Yeah yeah

You make feel like
I can't lie no more, I can't hide no more
Got to be true to myself
I am just too close to love you
You make feel like
Iâve been locked out of heaven
So I'll be on my way

Oooh all I need is a beauty and a beat
Trouble, trouble
I am just too close to love you
So I'll be on my way
