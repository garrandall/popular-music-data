99
I've been waiting so long
Oh 99
Where did we go wrong
Oh 99
I love you

99
I keep breaking your heart
Oh 99
How can we be apart
Oh 99
I love you

I never thought it would happen
I feel quite the same
I don't want to hurt you anymore
I never knew it would work out
No one to blame
You know I love you 99

99
You keep holding my hand
Oh 99
They don't know who I am
Oh 99
I love you

I never thought it would happen
I feel quite the same
I don't want to hurt you anymore
I never knew it would work out
No one to blame
You know I love you 99

99
I can't take it no more
Oh 99
Oh we were so sure
Oh 99
I love you

I never thought it would happen
I feel quite the same
I don't want to hurt you anymore
I never knew it would work out
No one to blame
You know I love you 99
