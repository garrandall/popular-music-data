Madrid, Madrid
Where is my love
Why did you let me
Leave my love

At the airport in sunny Spain
I had two hours to catch a plane
I was lonely as I could be
Until a senorita smiled at me

There was music and sweet guitars
And in her eyes were a million stars
She was lovely beyond compare
And in that moment
I had learned to care

She was to me, a serenade
A melody that my heart had played
And all too soon, I had to go
She understood that I loved her so

I waved goodbye, she waved goodbye
And from my window, I could see her cry
I went away and when I did
I left my heart with her in old Madrid

I waved goodbye, she waved goodbye
And from my window, I could see her cry
I went away and when I did
I left my heart with her in old Madrid

Madrid, Madrid
Please tell my love that
She is all I'm dreaming of
