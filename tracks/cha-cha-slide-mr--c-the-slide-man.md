 You gone too far now nigga!


They gone too far now Nore, they gone too far now Capone ( Wicked!)
They gone too far now Wayne, they gone too far now Lexx

( Wayne Wonder what's up?!)
For the gangsters, for the gangsters


Anything goes when we ride (When we ride)
Even with my little shorty by my side
Gallang so nuh bag a noise (Nuh bag a noise)
Burn up I'll pop and hit them by surprise
You better not move, when I say freeze
Because we nuh fraid fi pop off and squeeze
Bout you a bawl, and beg man fi ease
And we nuh bomb pon a fool like bees


So you wanna take my life ( Come on!) so you wanna hurt my wife
You just a wolf in disguise right a now you never seem surprised
( CNN we listenin!!!)
So you wanna take my life ( Come on!) so you wanna hurt my wife
You just a wolf in disguise right a now you never seem surprised


 So fuck you sound boy
 Kill a snitch boy
 Kill a batty boy
 In the yard
 Got to play it hard like we Gotti boy
 CNN soldiers
 We rep till it's over
 We rep when we drunk
 And we rep when we sober
 (Oh!) Look at that fatty at ten
 (Oh!) Lick a shot we back at it again
 It's Millitainment move over gotta move on my own
 We murder them a mercenary made man Capone (Wayne Wonder)


So you wanna take my life ( Come on!) so you wanna hurt my wife
You just a wolf in disguise right a now you never seem surprised
( CNN we listenin!!!)
So you wanna take my life ( Come on!) so you wanna hurt my wife
You just a wolf in disguise right a now you never seem surprised


Yuh waan fi bet mi money yuh fret and sweat like yuh a preacher
Any choice yuh set it's like a jet yuh haffi leave yah
Inna di party di bwoy dem start it like dem a creature
Mi and shorty rollin hotty wah dis we achieve yah
Mi haffi pop and buss it inna dem direction
Bwoy nah stop down like pop down erection
Car a crash, brain a splash, inna di intersection
Caught dem by surprise they never know mi have extension
So tell dem


So you wanna take my life ( Come on!) so you wanna hurt my wife
You just a wolf in disguise right a now you never seem surprised
( CNN we listenin!!!)
So you wanna take my life ( Come on!) so you wanna hurt my wife
You just a wolf in disguise right a now you never seem surprised


 I need a hot girl
 So I could drive in my hot car
 I'm not a pop star
 Take you to the Shark Bar
 So we could feast love amd just skip in
 You see a nigga made a dollar out of just five cent
 Now we ride through Tivoli
 Slide through Kennedy
 Usually we right in the club
 That's where the women be
 Laid back lightin some bud
 Sippin on Hennesy
 Everybody drink show love
 That's where my nigga be, OH!


So you wanna take my life ( Come on!) so you wanna hurt my wife
You just a wolf in disguise right a now you never seem surprised
( CNN we listenin!!!)
So you wanna take my life ( Come on!) so you wanna hurt my wife
You just a wolf in disguise right a now you never seem surprised


It's been a long time comin, hear we are

CNN dem got we back, yo we and dem par
We nah leff it cause we ever have it inna we car
So wah bring it, sling it if you think you have this ting
But if not mek mi do my ting
Cause Lex got di whole world clingin to di style dat I bring
Nore and Capone rap and Wayne sing
Cha ching cha ching!!!!


So you wanna take my life ( Come on!) so you wanna hurt my wife
You just a wolf in disguise right a now you never seem surprised
( CNN we listenin!!!)
So you wanna take my life ( Come on!) so you wanna hurt my wife
You just a wolf in disguise right a now you never seem surprised
