I couldn't believe the
Night you walked away
Left me alone to play
A fool's charade

And here I am
Still reaching out for you
Anticipating, awaiting
Your next move

Holding on, holding on
Trying hard to keep you
Am I wrong being strong
Don't leave me holding on

Feel like I'm
Falling from a fantasy
'Cause I am lost
In your reality

You said you knew
You couldn't give enough
For what we had
Was all I needed, love

Holding on, holding on
Trying hard to keep you
Breaking through, touching you
Don't leave me holding on

Holding on, holding on
Trying hard to keep you
Am I wrong being strong
Don't leave me holding on
Holding on

Holding on, holding on
Holding on, holding on
