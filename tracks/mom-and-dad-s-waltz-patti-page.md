I'd walk for miles - cry or smile
For mama and daddy
I want them - I want them to know
How I feel - My love is real
For my mama and daddy
I want them to know - I love them so.

In my heart the joy tears start 'cause I'm happy
And I pray every day for Mom and Pappy
And each night -
I'd walk for miles - cry or smile
For my mama and daddy
I want them to know - I love them so.

I'd fight in wars - do all the chores
For my mama and daddy
I want them to live on - til they're called
I'd work and slave - and never rave
For mama and daddy
Because I know I owe them my all.

In my heart the joy tears start 'cause I'm happy
And I pray every day for Mom and Pappy
And each night -
I'd walk for miles - cry or smile
For my mama and daddy
I want them to know - I love them so.

I love them so.
