One summer night
We fell in love
One summer night
I held you tight
You and I
Under the moon of love
Moon of love
One summer night
I kissed your lips
One summer night
I held you close
You and I
Under the moon of love
You kissed me, oh, so tenderly
And I knew this was love
And I as held you, oh, so close
I knew no one could ever take your place, oh
One summer night
We fell in love
One summer night
I held you tight
You and I
Under the moon of love
Moon of love
