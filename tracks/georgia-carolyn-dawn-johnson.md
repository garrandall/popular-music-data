If I'm not over you by the time I get to Georgia
Then I guess I'll be Alabama bound
There was a time when I'd do anything for you
But this time, baby, I won't turn around, yeah

I always wanted to get married
And I thought you were the one
But you never ever asked me
And I was tired of hangin' on

You know a girl can only be let down
So many times before she runs
And now this little bitty town's
Only got room for one of us, yeah

You always said I'd never leave
And if I did I wouldn't go far
So I know how I must look
With my tank 'a gas and beat up heart

Well baby I'm gone for good
You can count on that
Yeah, I'm gonna keep headin' west
Till I'm too far gone to come back, yeah

And if I'm not over you by the time I get to Georgia
Then I guess I'll be Alabama bound
There was a time when I'd do anything for you
But this time, baby, I won't turn around

I only got ten miles to go
Before I cross the state line
I can feel my hands shakin'
'Cause they usually turn the wheel around about this time

I heard that same ol' voice inside
I had to drown it out
So I found me a radio station playin' something fast
And I turned it up real loud

And if I'm not over you by the time I get to Georgia
Then I guess I'll be Alabama bound
There was a time when I'd do anything for you
But this time, baby, I won't turn around

There was a time when
I'd do anything for you
But this time, baby oh I won't turn around, yeah
No, I won't turn around

If I'm not over you By Georgia
Then I'll head to Alabama
Roll on to Mississippi or maybe Louisiana
I'll drive all the way to California

Oh, I won't turn around
No, I won't turn around
No, I won't turn around
No, I won't turn around

Turn around, turn around
I won't, I won't turn around
I won't, I won't turn around
No, I won't turn around

I won't, I won't turn around
I won't turn around
I won't, I won't turn around
I won't turn around
I won't, I won't turn around
I won't turn around
