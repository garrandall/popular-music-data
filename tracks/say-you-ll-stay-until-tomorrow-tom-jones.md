Say you'll stay untill tomorrow
I can't face tonight alone
Though I know it's over and we're through
Say you'll stay untill tomorrow
I need you

The words have all been said
Your mind's made up to go
You're standing by the bed
Like someone I don't know
Your love has died and there is nothing you can do
Though you try (though you try)
Yes you try (yes you try)
You can't live (you can't live)
With a lie so...

Say you'll stay untill tomorrow
I can't face tonight alone
Though I know it's over and we're through
Say you'll stay untill tomorrow
I need you

I've known for some time now
That thing's just ain't been right
Cause when we try to talk
We both get so uptight
But now you've told the truth
And I know where I stand
Though it hurts (though it hurts)
Deep inside (deep inside)
Give me time (give me time)
I'll get by so...

Say you'll stay until tomorrow
I can't face tonight alone
Though I know it's over and we're through
Say you'll stay until tomorrow
I need you
Though I know it's over and we're through
Say you'll stay until tomorrow
I neeeeeeeeedddd you
