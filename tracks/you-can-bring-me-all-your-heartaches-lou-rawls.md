When the world becomes too much for you
When the road ahead is hard to see
When you feel you don't know what to do
Baby, you can turn to me

I say now
You can bring me all your heartaches
Cry on my shoulder any day
You can bring me all your heartaches
I'll kiss your worries away
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll kiss your worries away

When it seems the day will never end
When things are wrong as they can be
When you wonder if you've got a friend
Baby, just remember me

I say now
You can bring me all your heartaches
Cry on my shoulder any day
You can bring me all your heartaches
I'll kiss your worries away
I'll kiss your worries away
I'm gonna kiss your worries away

I will prove to you how much I care
You'll never, never have to stand alone
In your hour of need you'll find me there
You can my arms your home

You can bring me all your heartaches
You can bring me every one of your heartaches
You can bring me all your heartaches
