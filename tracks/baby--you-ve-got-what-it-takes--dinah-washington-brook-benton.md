Well now, it takes more than a robin to make the winter go
And it takes two lips of fire to melt away the snow
Well, it takes two hearts a-cookin' to make a fire grow
And baby, you've got what it takes (yeah)


You know it takes a lot of kissin'
(Tell me about it)
To make a romance sweet (uh huh)
Oh it takes a lot of lovin' to make my life complete
Mmm, and it takes a lot of woman to knock me off my feet
And baby, you've got what it takes


I said, mmm, mmm, mmm
Uh huh, mmm
You know you've got just what it takes


Because it takes more than an effort to stay away from you
It'd take more than a lifetime to prove that I'll be true
But it takes somebody special to make me say, "I do"
(yeah)
And baby, you've got what it takes


Ah, ah, hah mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm
You know you've got just what it takes


Because it takes, (yeah, oh yeah)
(You're back in my spot again, honey)
(I like your spot)
To stay away from you
(I can't stay away from her)
It takes more than a lifetime, daddy
To prove that I'll be true
(Now it's you)
But it takes somebody special
(Like me, baby)
To make me say, "I do"
And baby, you've got what it takes
(Ha, ha, say it again, huh?)
(C'mon, let's do it one more time, all right?)
And baby, you've got what it takes
(One more time, Brook)
(Ah-ha, alright okay, ah-ha)
And baby, you've got what it takes
