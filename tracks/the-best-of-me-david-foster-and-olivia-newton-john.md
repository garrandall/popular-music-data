(David Foster)
So many years gone, still I remember
How did I ever let my heart believe
In one who never gave enough to me
And so many years gone, a love that was so wrong
And I can't forget the way it used to be

You were my one more chance I never thought I'd find
You were the one romance I've always known in my mind
No one will ever touch me more
I only hope that in return
I might've saved the best of me for you

And we'll have no ending, no no
If we can hold on
And I think I've come this far because of you
Could be no other love but ours will do

You were my one more chance I never thought I'd find
You were the one romance I've always known in my mind
No one will ever touch me more
I only hope that in return
I might've saved the best of me for you

No one will ever touch me more
I only hope that in return
No matter how much we have to learn
I've saved the best of me for you
