Umm-hmm
Now, there's a new dance
It goes like-a this low
I know what you're thinkin', babe
Child, it ain't The Jerk, n-no

Now, if ya come here to swim
Now man, you're out a-luck
The name of this dance
Child, they call, The Duck

Hey Lord, you run down to the river, Lord
(Come on baby)
Then you get a duck
(Try your luck)

Oh Lord, you start to flap your wings
(Come on baby)
Child, until you get enough
(Do The Duck)

Now, come on, baby
(Come on baby)
Come on, baby
(Come on baby)

You know you're lookin, ' so
(Come on baby)
So, good now
Alright
(Do The Duck)

Ow!



(Do-do-do-aah)

Just like a-workin' on a chain gang
You're bustin' rocks
But now you're groovin' on the Dance floor, Lord
(Come on baby)
Hey now, with a stone fox
(Do The Duck)

Come on, baby
(Come on baby)
Come on, baby
(Come on baby)

Now, just a little bit softer
(Do The Duck)
A little bit softer
(Do The Duck)
Now, just a little bit softer, now
(Do The Duck)

Now, just a little bit louder
(Do The Duck)
Lord, just a little bit-a louder
(Do The Duck)

My-my-my-my-my-my-my
(Do The Duck)
My-my, baby look
Come on
(Do The Duck)

FADES-
Now, do The Duck
Hey, do The Duck
(Do The Duck)
Hey, do The Duck
(Come on baby)
Hey, do The Duck
(Come on baby)

Woo-ooo-ooo.
