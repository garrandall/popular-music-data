Lets get it, FBG Shit, turn up, squad
Bet they can't do it like me
Bet they can't do it like me
Bet they can't do it like me
Bet they can't do it like me

These niggas sayin' they gettin' money, bet they can't do it like me
These niggas think they stuntin', bet they can't do it like me
Thumb through them hundreds, bet they can't do it like me
Yo girl wanna fuck me cause you can't do it like me
Bet they can't do it like me, bet they can't do it like me
Bet they can't do it like me, bet they can't do it like me
Thumb through them hundreds, bet they can't do it like me
Bet they can't do it like me, bet they can't do it like me

These niggas sayin' they gettin' money, bet they can't do it like me
If you gettin' so much money, why yo pockets on E? (please explain to me)
Bitch you broke don't talk that money shit to me
And all I hear is money, I got that shit on repeat
I put money over hoes cause ion't really need'em
See my right pocket Chris and my left pocket Peter
Cause they both super fat thats how you know they some eaters
And my wrist on Foes like I bought it from the freezer
Turn up

These niggas sayin' they gettin' money, bet they can't do it like me
These niggas think they stuntin', bet they can't do it like me
Thumb through them hundreds, bet they can't do it like me
Yo girl wanna fuck me cause you can't do it like me
Bet they can't do it like me, bet they can't do it like me
Bet they can't do it like me, bet they can't do it like me
Thumb through them hundreds, bet they can't do it like me
Bet they can't do it like me, bet they can't do it like me


I be flexin' so damn hard, bet you can't do it like me
And you know it's team no lackin', so killing me unlikely
All my niggas with the shit, they shoot just like Spike Lee
We come through yo block and you run just like track meet
You niggas mad? oops my fault, I'mma grind like Tony Hawk
Bands on me do the money walk and that chopper make you do a Somersault
You niggas say you gettin' money, bet you can't do it like me
All I think about is money, I'm thumbin' through a check right now as we speak
Let's get it


These niggas sayin' they gettin' money, bet they can't do it like me
These niggas think they stuntin', bet they can't do it like me
Thumb through them hundreds, bet they can't do it like me
Yo girl wanna fuck me cause you can't do it like me
Bet they can't do it like me, bet they can't do it like me
Bet they can't do it like me, bet they can't do it like me
Thumb through them hundreds, bet they can't do it like me
Bet they can't do it like me, bet they can't do it like me


Bet they can't do it like me, in the club bands on me
Got ya main thing on me, tryna put brain on
She know Montana got the juice, she know the young nigga the truth
Spazzing goin' in the booth, stuntin', flexing out the roof
Something you can't do, bitch you can't touch these duds
Got yo main bitch lovin' da crew, she gone do me then my mans
All it takes is a fifth of hen, a couple bands make her dance
She gone turn up act a fool, team no lacking keep the tools
Turn up, turn up, turn up


These niggas sayin' they gettin' money, bet they can't do it like me
These niggas think they stuntin', bet they can't do it like me
Thumb through them hundreds, bet they can't do it like me
Yo girl wanna fuck me cause you can't do it like me
Bet they can't do it like me, bet they can't do it like me
Bet they can't do it like me, bet they can't do it like me
Thumb through them hundreds, bet they can't do it like me
Bet they can't do it like me, bet they can't do it like me


I bet they can't do it like me, I do it like BT
Boss City , Clout Boys Bitch, St. Lawrence 063
Twenty-Thirteen Paley
True shit, nigga I'm flee

But ain't nothin' new to me cause I'm from FBG
Bitch I got that Chop, call me Jackie Chan
All my dough from overseas, I think it's Amsterdam
I done broke my thumb, thumbing through them bands
Marathon Marathon I'm runnin' through them bands
Let's get it


These niggas sayin' they gettin' money, bet they can't do it like me
These niggas think they stuntin', bet they can't do it like me
Thumb through them hundreds, bet they can't do it like me
Yo girl wanna fuck me cause you can't do it like me
Bet they can't do it like me, bet they can't do it like me
Bet they can't do it like me, bet they can't do it like me
Thumb through them hundreds, bet they can't do it like me
Bet they can't do it like me, bet they can't do it like me


Bet they can't do it like me , big 30 on me
These niggas ain't in the field, tese niggas ain't in the streets
Put that shit on Skeez put that shit on me
When I'm fuckin' these thots, bet you can't kill it like me
See my niggas be flexin'
I be truckin' them Lexus'
A hundred bricks and we checkin'
Try us and we clap ya
Team no lackin' on top
These opp niggas be stressin'
Got Dutchie in this bitch
Double O, Montana, we finessin'
Lets get it
