(Oh won't you tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me,
What are boys made of)

(Sugar and spice) no, no, no, no,
(Everything nice) I don't think so
I said what are boys made of

My heart would?
I love him so
But I sure would like to know
(He does things I can't explain)
Tell me are they all the same
What are boys made of

(Sugar and spice) no, no, no, no,
(Everything nice) I don't think so
I said what are boys made of

(He does things I can't explain
What are boys made of)

Oh tell me do they ever cry
And what is the reason why
(He gets nervous and looks sad)
When I said come meet my dad
Oh what are boys made of

(Sugar and spice) no, no, no, no,
(Everything nice) I don't think so
I said what are boys made of

I wanna know now
(What are boys made of)
Oh won't you tell me
(What are boys made of)
