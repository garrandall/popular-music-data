So long well it's sad to say
But you're only foolin' yourself
So long I'm glad you're happy that way
But you're only foolin' yourself

I saw you walk down the street
With somebody new
It's funny people I meet
They talk about me and you yeah

But who's to blame for our bein' apart
Is it me or is it you
And who'd ever say that you're still in my heart
'Cause now really the best I can do is say

So long well it's sad to say
But you're only foolin' yourself
So long I'm glad you're happy that way
But you're only foolin' yourself
So just go foolin' yourself

It's funny I couldn't see
The change you went through
All those new friends that you'd meet
And the places they took you to

And all you would say
You would say they're just friends
And you laughed in my face 'cause you knew
And I'd never know where you'd been late at night
So now really the best I can do is say

So long well it's sad to say
But you're only foolin' yourself
So long I'm glad you're happy that way
But you're only foolin' yourself

So now you walk down' the street
With somebody new
It's funny people I meet
They don't talk about me and you no more

But who's to blame for our bein' apart
Is it me or is it you
And who'd ever say that you're still in my heart
So now really the best I can do is say

So after all this time all I have to say
Is you're only foolin' yourself
So now I gotta smile won't cry for yesterday
'Cause you're only foolin' yourself

So long well it's sad to say
But you're only foolin' yourself
So long I'm glad you're happy that way
But you're only foolin' yourself
So just go foolin' yourself
You're foolin' yourself
