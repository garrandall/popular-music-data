Well get up up on the dancefloor tonight
I've got two left feet and a bottle of red wine
Making me feel like the beat and the bassline
Are in my blood, both hands upon her waistline
Get on up baby dance to the rhythm of the music
Don't care what the DJ chooses
Get lost in the rhythm of me
Place don't close until we wanna leave it

You and I we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going, somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes, and let's pretend we're dancing in the street
In Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona

Well get up up on the dancefloor, move, it's a Saturday night
I fell in love with the sparkle in the moonlight
Reflected in your beautiful eyes, I guess that is destiny doing it right
And dance like they do in the Mediterranean
Spin you around me again and again and
You're like something that God has sent me
I want you baby, solamente

You and I we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going, somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes, and let's pretend we're dancing in the street
In Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Oh Barcelona

So let's pretend we're dancing in the street
In Barcelona
Las Ramblas, I'll meet you, we'll dance around La Sagrada Familia
Drinking Sangria, mi niÃ±a, te amo mi cariÃ±o
Mamacita, rica, si tÃº, te adoro seÃ±orita
Los otros, viva la vida
Come on let's be free in Barcelona
Las Ramblas, I'll meet ya, come on and dance with me, in Barcelona
Drinking Sangria, I just want to be in Barcelona
Mamacita, rica, feel that summer breeze in Barcelona
Los otros, viva la vida, siempre vida Barcelona
