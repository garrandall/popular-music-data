1, 2, 3, 4!


Well, she was just 17, if you know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another? (Ooh)
When I saw her standing there?


Well, she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long, I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another (Woo)
When I saw her standing there


Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine


Well, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
Now, I'll never dance with another (Woo)
Since I saw her standing there




Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine


Oh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another (Woo)
Since I saw her standing there


Oh, since I saw her standing there
Yeah, well, since I saw her standing there
