(Take the tires and light the fires. Go!)

Revvin' up your engine
Listen to her howlin' roar
Metal under tension
Beggin' you to touch and go

Highway to the Danger Zone
Ride into the Danger Zone

Headin' into twilight
Spreadin' out her wings tonight
She got you jumpin' off the deck
And shovin' into overdrive

Highway to the Danger Zone
I'll take you
Right into the Danger Zone

You'll never say hello to you
Until you get it on the red line overload
You'll never know what you can do
Until you get it up as high as you can go

Out along the edge
Is always where I burn to be
The further on the edge
The hotter the intensity

Highway to the Danger Zone
I'm gonna take you
Right into the Danger Zone
Highway to the Danger Zone
Right into the Danger Zone

"I'm gonna take my shirt off and play volleyball in the Danger Zone.
Then I'm gonna go buy some shoes, DANGEROUSLY,
And then I'm gonna go home and sit in my Danger Zone chair
And look at the Danger Zone internet."

Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer in the locker room in underwear.
Take my breath away!
I asphyxiate cuz you took away my breath
I need it to live
Give me back my breath!
