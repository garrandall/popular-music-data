Hey, mister, please
Spare me some time, I'm lonely
My heart is crying, help me
Hey, mister, please, help me
I need something inside

Hey, mister, please
Please be the one who can give
One gentle touch or maybe
One gentle kiss, please, please
I need it desparately

Cause I've been giving
And giving and giving
And never getting no results
I'm tired of searching
And searching and searching
Please be the one to see what I need

Give me some mellow loving
That's what I need from you
I want some mellow loving
I want it just from you

Give me some mellow loving
That's what I need from you
(That's what I need from you)
I want some mellow loving
I need it just from you

Hey, mister, please
I'm like a flower and I need
A little rain or maybe
Your sunshine could just
Somehow ease the pain

Hey, mister, please
Please be the one who can give
One gentle touch or maybe
One gentle kiss, please, please
I need it desperately

Cause I've been giving
And giving and giving
And never getting no results
I'm tired of searching
And searching and searching
Please be the one to see what I need

Give me some mellow loving
That's what I need from you
(That's what I need from you)
I want some mellow loving
I want it just from you

I'm tired of sitting home lonely
Waiting for one little touch
Can't you see that I'm a woman
And I'm hungry
Can't you see what I need

Give me some mellow loving
That's what I need from you
(That's what I need from you)
I want some mellow loving
I want it just from you

Give me

Give me some mellow loving
That's what I need from you
(That's what I need from you)
I want some mellow loving
I need it just from you
