Ain't no more Motown Review
And The Beatles have broken up too
British band have gone back
Colored kids are now black
And love has changed into brand new

Ain't no more Motown Review
And The Beatles have broken up too
JFK has been shot
We miss him a lot
He always knew what to do

Ain't no more Rock & Roll shows
On the road, now it's Disco
Television's no longer live
Now it's taped
Ahead of time

Kids don't sit in movies no more
Holding hands, no romance
And lovers don't kiss in balconies
All they do is dance so free

Ain't no bottles of Coke made with glass
That's all past
Nobody wears dungarees
Now it's jeans
If you please

Ain't no more Motown Review
And The Beatles are broken up too
British band have gone back
Colored kids are now black
Love is brand new

Oh...

Ain't no more Motown Review
And The Beatles have broken up too
British band have gone back
Colored kids are now black
And love is brand new

Say na-na, say na-na, say na-na-na-na-na
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Ain't no more Motown Review
And The Beatles have broken up too
They have fallen apart
Even Dick Clark
Is starting older too

Ain't no more Motown Review
There is walk and talk up on the moon
Little Stevie's grown tall
Dr. J owns the balls
And love has changed into brand new

Say na-na, say na-na, say na-na-na-na-na
Oh... oh... oh
Can't go on, can't go on, can't go on, Motown

Ain't no more Motown Review
And The Beatles have broken up too
British band have gone back
Colored kids are now black
Oh, yeah

Oh... oh... oh... oh... oh...

Ain't no Motown Review
No-no-no-no-no-no
British bands have gone back
Colored kids are now black

Ain't no more Motown Review
And The Beatles have broken up too
British band have gone back
Colored kids are now black
Love has changed into brand new

Ain't no more Motown Review
And The Beatles have broken up too
JFK has been shot
We miss him a lot
He always knew what to do

Ain't no more Motown Review
Ain't no more Motown Review
No-no-no-no-no
Motown where are you

Ain't no more Motown Review
Motown where are you
Ain't no more Motown Review
And love's not the same without you

Ain't no more Motown Review
And nothing's about to be soon
Ain't no more Motown Review
Ain't nothin' out here but a zoo

Ain't no more Motown Review
Motown where are you
Ain't no more Motown Review
