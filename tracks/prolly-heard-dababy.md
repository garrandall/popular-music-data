Prolly heard I was broke from a broke nigga
Prolly heard I'm a hoe from a hoe
I don't know what you know
I ain't running from no nigga
These bitches be waiting in line after shows
I don't won't fuck with her, let my bro hit her
I'm the first one to come out of Charlotte
Niggas know I put on for that fo' nigga

'Bout to buy a new lambo, let's go, nigga
Tired of selling them zips, get a bow, nigga
Me and Da used to post at the store
Gucci Mane in 06', swing my door, nigga
I told her, "I keep hearing voices"
Why he rich and he keep wearing Forces?
These niggas, they lactose intolerant (How 'bout you?)
Bitch, I'm married to cheese, no divorcing
Bitch, you can't get a ring if you want it
I pull up with a bitch that's so thick, think I'm Norbit
Slamming a hoe like I'm O'Neal
She want money for pussy, bitch, no deal
You can bet if I fuck, it's a freebie
Bitches pay VIP just to see me
I'm a shark, he a shrimp, nigga peewee
Fuck a rapper, I spit on his CD
Bitch ass nigga

Prolly heard I was broke from a broke nigga
Prolly heard I'm a hoe from a hoe
I don't know what you know
I ain't running from no nigga
These bitches be waiting in line after shows
I don't want fuck with her, let my bro hit her
I'm the first one to come out of Charlotte
Niggas know I put on for that fo' nigga

Prolly heard I was broke from a broke nigga
Prolly heard I'm a hoe from a hoe
I don't know what you know
I ain't running from no nigga
These bitches be waiting in line after shows
I don't want fuck with her, let my bro hit her
I'm the first one to come out of Charlotte
Niggas know I put on for that fo', nigga

I'm still in the city bitch, no doubt
Gotta give me six figures to go out
I count up 50K 'fore I walk through
You try me at my show we gone show out
I just left the club with yo hoe, fucked her right on the floor
She said I fucked up her blow out
My bad boo, I thought that was weave
Orange juice, the first nigga try me, I squeeze
Before I fucked her, fucked a few of her friends
Can you tell her stop calling me please?
Bitches know I'm a dog off the leash
A big dog, niggas call me OG
Cross that line with us, he can't come back and say, "Sorry"
My city, they call that a plea
Let these rap niggas lie like it's sweet
I'm from Charlotte, you die when it's beef, nigga

Prolly heard I was broke from a broke nigga
Prolly heard I'm a hoe from a hoe
I don't know what you know
I ain't running from no nigga
These bitches be waiting in line after shows
I don't want fuck with her, let my bro hit her
I'm the first one to come out of Charlotte
Niggas know I put on for that fo' nigga

Prolly heard I was broke from a broke nigga
Prolly heard I'm a hoe from a hoe
I don't know what you know
I ain't running from no nigga
These bitches be waiting in line after shows
I don't want fuck with her, let my bro hit her
I'm the first one to come out of Charlotte
Niggas know I put on for that fo' nigga
