Clap, clap, clap, clap
If you need a fix, yeah
If you need a fix, baby, I got it

And you say Blackstreet, and you say
Clap your hands, just clap your hands
Just clap your hands, just clap

Oh, sugar girl, you sexy thing
I like the way you swing
I always wanna be your lover
I always wanna be your lover

You can call me
If you need a fix or two
Girl, you know how we do
I got to get with you

You can get me on the phone
Dial my number, I'll be waiting
When I see you, we'll be anticipating
All I want to do is drive you crazy, girl
If we can flow, baby, let's go see me tonight

If you need a fix
Let me be the one you can call on
If you wanna fix
I can give you what you need
If you need a fix
Baby, you know I can give you
More and more, on and on

You don't have to worry
I'll be there for you
It's time for you to be my girl
It's time for you to be my girl

We've been knowing each other
For some time, girl
And I don't know
What I'd do without you

If you need a fix
I need a fix, you need a fix, girl
If you want a fix
I can give you what you need
If you need a fix
Baby, you know I can give you
More and more, on and on

Teddy, play, yeah
I can give it to you, baby
Get down, get down
Get down, baby
I can give it to you, baby
I can give it to you
Get down, down, down
Take it to the priest

If you need a fix
I can give it to you
If you need a fix
I can give it to you

I can be your candy man
I can be your candy man
I can be your candy man
I can be

If you need a fix
Let me be the one you can call on
If you wanna fix
I wanna be your candy man
If you need a fix
Baby, you know I can give you
More and more, on and on

If you need a fix
Let me be the one you call on
If you wanna fix
I wanna be the one you need
If you need a fix
We can do it all night long, girl
More and more, on and on

And you say Blackstreet
Clap your hands, just clap your hands, just
And you say Blackstreet
Clap, clap, clap your hands, just clap your hands, just

And you say Blackstreet
Clap your hands, just clap your hands, just
