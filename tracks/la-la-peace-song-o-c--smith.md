Mmm hm, la la, oh, yeah
What's that sound, so profound
Over heads of children, Lord
As they pass
Sounds like thunder
But there's no rain
This kind of thunder blows down
Doors and walls and things
Ah, somebody's crying
For those dying
But no one knows
How long it's gonna last
Steel birds falling to the ground
Not knowing what's below
When the end comes, tell me now
Where we gonna go
Oh, people, that's my
La la la la peace song
La la la la, tell me
Why can't we get along
Oh, people, that's my
La la la la peace song
La la la la, tell me
Why can't we get along
Oh, I'll tell you why
It's not safe to fly
You might get hijacked
To an unknown land
Desperate people seeking refuge
From corruption, oh
By means of subterfuge
Oh, sabotage, men at large
Innocent people suffering
By another's hand
Racial injustice dividing men
Allowing their hate to grow
Tell me, when's it gonna end
Whoa, oh, people, that's my
La la la la la la la peace song
La la la la, tell me
Why can't we get along
Oh, people, that's my
La la la la la la la peace song
La la la la, tell me
Why can't we get along
Oh, sing it with me now
Oh, hear me, that's my
La la la la la peace song
La la la la, tell me
Why can't we get along
Oh, hear that sound, so profound
It's the voice of people
Lord, hear them pray
Feel the strength of their words
Lead us not to temptation
Lest we go astray
Oh, people, that's my
La la la la peace song
La la la la, tell me
Why can't we get along
Oh, that's my
La la la la la peace song
La la la la, tell me
Why can't we get along
