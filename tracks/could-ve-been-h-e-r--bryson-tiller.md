Please, allow me to show you something
Mmm, somebody give me, yeah


Somebody give me, uh
Somebody tell me the answers
Me and you isn't the answer (Uh)
Me and you isn't (No)
Maybe I'm tellin' myself that
But there ain't nothin' that'll change that
What good would it be if I knew how you felt about me? (Yeah)


It could've been right, but I was wrong (Uh)
Only think 'bout you when I'm alone (Yeah)
The part of me that cared inside is gone
And I know that I can't get caught up


We could've been
And we try to pretend
Every now and again
We don't dream about, don't think about what
We could've been
Though I'm holding it in
'Cause I know in the end
You dream about, I think about what
We could've been
We could've been (Yeah)
We could've (Damn)


Remember?
Remember the night in Miami?
First time you put your arms around me
I'm up reminiscin' (Oh yeah)
And thinking 'bout you isn't helping
Thinking 'bout you doesn't tell me
What good it would do if I decide to face the truth


It could've been right, but I was wrong
Only think 'bout you when I'm alone
You only hit me up when she's not home
And that's why I can't get caught up


We could've been
And we try to pretend
Every now and again
We don't dream about, don't think about what
We could've been (Oh yeah)
Though I'm holding it in
'Cause I know in the end
You dream about, I think about what
We could've been, we could've been
We could've, we could've been
What we could've been, we could've been


What we could've been, yeah
What we could've been


Ayy
What we could've been
What we should've been
If I wasn't, if I wasn't with somebody
If you gotta hide it, what's the point of trying?
I ain't just your friend, no, what's the point of lying?
Tryna sell a story ain't nobody buyin'
Look me in my eyes, don't that feel nice?
Why should it end? Baby, I could've been
I could've been him, more than your friend
Just say where and when, where to make a trip
Baby, make a wish, be the one I'm with
Shouldâ€™ve been a, should've, could've, would have been, ayy
Yeah, I would have been (Damn)
Yeah, I would have been (Yeah)


Damn, damn (Could've been)
Yeah, we could've been (Oh no)
