We're the ones with the runaway eyes
We're the ones who can improvise
Give us room in a hot situation
We believe in positive stimulation

(We are the young)
We are the young, with the modern attitude
Breaking down the walls, breaking all the rules
(We are the young)
Tomorrow comes and we might go away
So we don't worry about the price we pay
We are the young, (oh), we are the young
(We are the young), yeah

Every street is an arcade of dreams, oh
I found downtown exploding at the seam, oh
With lights and sounds and the soul parade
Light and blue color promenade

(We are the young)
We are the young, with the modern attitude
Breaking down the walls, breaking all the rules
(We are the young)
Tomorrow comes and we might go away
So we don't worry about the price we pay

Another way to take control
A brand new day to rock and roll

(We are the young)
We are the young (we are the young)

Another way to gain control
When you need to rock and roll

(We are the young)
We are the young, with the modern attitude
Breaking down the walls, breaking all the rules
(We are the young)
Tomorrow comes and we might go away
So we don't worry about the price we pay

(We are the young)
We are the young, with the modern attitude
Breaking down the walls, breaking all the rules
(We are the young)
We are the young
We are the young
We are the young

We are the young (we are the young)
Young, young, young (we are the young)
Young, young, oh (we are the young)
