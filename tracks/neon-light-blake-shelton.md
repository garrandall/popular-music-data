Ever since you left me
I've been ridin' 'round, cranking up a little country gold heartbreak
Cried and dried these tears
I don't know how much more missin' you I can take

I prayed, prayed, prayed
For a sign, sign, sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time, damn time

There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel

I'll take a shot of I don't care what you're doing now
Chase that one with a cold screw you
When that's done, I just might wash it down
With a big pitcher of someone new

That blonde, blonde, blonde
At the bar, bar, bar
See if she wants to try and unbreak my heart, heart, heart

There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel

When we were together
I thought life would suck forever
Even though I knew better than the pain would never end
They say the night's darkest just before the dawn
Gets kissed by the day break, got down on my knees

And I prayed, prayed, prayed
For a sign, sign, sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time, damn time

There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel
