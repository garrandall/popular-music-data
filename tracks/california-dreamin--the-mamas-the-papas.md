All the leaves are brown
(All the leaves are brown)
And the sky is gray
(And the sky is gray)
I've been for a walk
(I've been for a walk)
On a winter's day
(On a winter's day)
I'd be safe and warm
(I'd be safe and warm)
If I was in L.A
(If I was in L.A.)
California dreamin'
(California dreamin') on such a winter's day


Stopped in to a church I passed along the way
Well I got down on my knees
(got down on my knees)
And I pretend to pray
(I pretend to pray)
You know the preacher likes the cold
(preacher likes the cold)
He knows I'm gonna stay
(knows I'm gonna stay)
California dreamin'
(California dreamin') on such a winter's day

All the leaves are brown
(All the leaves are brown)
And the sky is gray
(And the sky is gray)
I've been for a walk
(I've been for a walk)
On a winter's day
(On a winter's day)
If I didn't tell her
(If I didn't tell her)
I could leave today
(I could leave today)
California dreamin' (California dreamin') on such a winter's day
California dreamin' on such a winter's day
California dreamin' on such a winter's day
