New Kung Fu Kenny
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Y'all know what happens on Earth stays on Earth
Here we go


I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a, I don't give a, I don't give a fuck

I'm willin' to die for this shit
I done cried for this shit, might take a life for this shit
Put the Bible down and go eye for an eye for this shit
D.O.T. my enemy, won't catch a vibe for this shit, ayy
I been stomped out in front of my mama
My daddy commissary made it to commas
Bitch, all my grandmas dead
So ain't nobody prayin' for me, I'm on your head, ayy
30 millions later, know the feds watchin'
Auntie on my telegram like, "Be cautious"
I be hangin' out at Tam's, I be on Stockton
I don't do it for the 'Gram, I do it for Compton
I'm willin' to die for this shit, nigga
I'll take your fuckin' life for this shit, nigga
We ain't goin' back to broke, family sellin' dope
That's why you maney ass rap niggas better know

If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'mma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'mma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element

I'm allergic to a bitch nigga, ayy
An imaginary rich nigga, ayy
Seven figures, ho, that's slimmer than my bitch figure, ayy
Goin' digital and physical on all y'all, ayy
Bunch of criminals and money in my phone calls, ayy
We okay, we let the A1 fly
Relocate, jump on the same G5
Checkin' for me heavy 'cause I go, yeah, I go, yeah
They never been ready, yeah, I know, yeah, I know, yeah
100K spread 'cross the floor, 'cross the floor yeah
None of y'all fuckin' with the flow yeah, the flow yeah
Years in the makin' and don't y'all mistake it
I got 'em by a landslide, we talkin' 'bout races
You know this'll never be a tie, just look at their laces
You know careers take off, just gotta be patient
Mister one through five that's the only logic
Fake my death, go to Cuba, that's the only option

If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'mma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'mma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element

Damned if I do, if I don't, ya
Goddamn us all if you won't, ya
Damn, damn, damn, it's a goddamn shame
You ain't frontline, get out the goddamn way

Niggas thought they weren't gonna see me, huh?
Niggas thought that K-Dot real life was the same life they see on TV, huh?
Niggas wanna flex on me and be in LA for free, huh?
Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need receipt, huh?
'Cause most of y'all ain't real
Most of y'all go squeal
Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed
Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman
Because it's all in your eyes
Most of y'all tell lies
Most of y'all don't fade
Most of y'all been advised
Last LP I tried to lift the black artist
But it's a difference 'tween black artist and wack artist


If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'mma make it look sexy


It's the one and only, the world's greatest, the Kid Capri


If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'mma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element
