Ten o'clock, ten-thirty
Eleven o'clock, eleven-thirty
Curfew time

Nite owl strolling down the
Street about the break of day
Oh, nite owl, listen, boy
What you think your mama gonna say
Hey, hey, hey

Wait til you get in the door
Mama told you once before
Whoa, whoa, nite owl

Nite owl strolling with his
Keys swinging in his hand
Oh, owl, the nite owl strutting
Up the stairs like a natural man
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Boy, you must be out your mind
Ain't you heard of curfew time
Whoa, whoa, nite owl

Your daddy told you long ago
Not to come in late no more
Running over town just like a clown

But you think that he's a square
And you feel you've been everywhere
Wait til tomorrow, you'll sit down

Oh, nite owl strolling with
His dark glasses on his eyes
Oh, owl, nite owl, listen, boy
Don't you dare tell daddy no lie
Hey, hey, hey

I said that you were such a silly jerk
Your daddy ought to make you work
Whoa, whoa, nite owl

Your daddy told you long ago
Not to come in late no more
Running over town just like a clown

But you think that he's a square
And you feel you've been everywhere
Wait til tomorrow, you'll sit down

Oh, nite owl strolling with
His dark glasses on his eyes
Oh, owl, nite owl, listen, boy
Don't you dare tell daddy no lie
Hey, hey, hey

I said that you were such a silly jerk
Your daddy ought to make you work
Whoa, whoa, nite owl

Whoa, nite owl
You better come in, boy
It's getting late, I told you
Bout staying out all times of night
Hey, hey, hey
