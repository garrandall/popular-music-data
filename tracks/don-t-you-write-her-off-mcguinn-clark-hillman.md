Been atop the New York skyline
Sailed across the ocean blue
Been alone on a desert island
And I've been a guru too

Don't you write her off like that
Don't you write her off like that
Don't you write her off like that
She's a real fine lady, don't you see?
Don't you write her off like that
Don't you write her off like that
Don't you write her off like that
She's a real fine lady, don't you see?

I met the girls in every city
Every town that I've passed through
You won't find one half as pretty
Or one with a heart so true

Don't you write her off like that
Don't you write her off like that
Don't you write her off like that
She's a real fine lady, don't you see?
Don't you write her off like that
Don't you write her off like that
Don't you write her off like that
She's a real fine lady, don't you see?

If you leave her now, he'll get her
Then I know you'll change your mind
You won't find one better
Can't you see that love is blind?

Don't you write her off like that
Don't you write her off like that
Don't you write her off like that
She's a real fine lady, don't you see?
Don't you write her off like that
Don't you write her off like that
Don't you write her off like that
She's a real fine lady, don't you see?
