Ooh ooh ooh Miss Grace
Satin and perfume and lace
The minute I saw your face
I knew that I loved you

Hey you, listen to me
I got a lot of truth I want to tell you
I just met a woman who turned me upside down
The rivers turn in their beds
Flowers bloom where she treads
She turns an awful lot of heads
When she comes to town

Miss Grace when you walk by
You're the twinkle in my eye
There's no need to wonder why
I've fallen for you

Ooh ooh ooh Miss Grace
Satin and perfume and lace
The minute I saw your face
I knew that I loved you

Strangest thing of all you see
Is that this could happen to me
Lady Grace she said she'll be so fine
Someday I'll make her mine all mine

Ooh ooh ooh Miss Grace
Satin and perfume and lace
The minute I saw your face
I knew that I loved you

Ooh ooh ooh Miss Grace
Satin and perfume and lace
The minute I saw your face
I knew that I loved you
