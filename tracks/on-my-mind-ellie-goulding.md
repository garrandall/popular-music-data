But I feel like I'm the only one who's feeling this way. 
Could I be the one for you?
And can I call you my babe?
Don't want me like I want you and you don't feel the same. 
I don't wanna make a fuss girl. 
Now just tell me it straight. 
Girl are you playing me?
Cause I wanna know. 
When I look into your eyes, 
I can see your soul. 
It's like all you've ever wanted.
She's all you've ever liked. 
Don't wanna be a part of you just cause you ain't her type. 


And now I don't understand it. 
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth. 
And I know I shouldn't say it. 
My heart don't understand. 
Why I got you on my mind. 
Why I got you on my mind. 
Why I got you on my mind. 
Why I got you on my mind. 
I don't understand why I got you on my mind. 
Why I got you on my mind. 
Why I got you on my mind. 
Why I got you on my mind. 


I'm just a silly little kid. 
That won't let go of you. 
Cause no one on this earth,
Makes me feel the way you do. 
I wanna take a risk. 
But I don't wanna be your man. 
I wanna be your everything. 
I guess I never can. 
I just wanna see you smile. 
Even just a little bit. 
Girl these scars will never heal. 
And my heart will never fix. 
But if I'm going crazy. 
And you feel the way I do. 
Tell me that you need me. 
Cause I'm holding onto you. 


And now I don't understand it. 
You don't mess with love. 
You mess with the truth. 
And I know I shouldn't say it. 
My heart don't understand. 
Why I got you on my mind. 
Why I got you on my mind. 
Why I got you on my mind. 
Why I got you on my mind. 
My heart don't understand why I got you on my mind. 
(You think you know somebody)
Why I got you on my mind. 
(You think you know somebody)
Why I got you on my mind. 
(You think you know somebody)
Why I got you on my mind. 

You've got yourself. 
In a dangerous zone. 
Cause we both have the fear. 
Fear of being alone. 
And I still don't understand it. 
You don't mess with love. 
You mess with the truth. 
And my heart don't understand it. 
Understand it. 
Understand it. 

Why I got you on my mind. 
(You think you know somebody)
Why I got you on my mind. 
(You think you know somebody)
Why I got you on my mind. 
(You think you know somebody)
Why I got you on my mind. 
My heart don't understand why I got you on my mind. 
(You think you know somebody)
Why I got you on my mind. 
(You think you know somebody)
Why I got you on my mind. 
(You think you know somebody)
Why I got you on my mind. 
My heart don't understand. 
Why I got you on my mind. 
(You think you know somebody)
(You think you know somebody)
Why I got you on my mind. 
(You think you know somebody)
Why I got you on my mind.
