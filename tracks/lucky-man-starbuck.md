Rock and roll just keeps me crazy
Southern living makes me lazy
Tired of playing Casanova
When I'm just a Shady Grover
Ooh, I'm a lucky man, Ooh, I'm a lucky man
It's me and you and you and me
And we're happy as a monkey in a coconut tree
Riviera sunny seaside
Foreign ladies got my weak side
Tired of drinking crazy French wine
Coming home now if you're still mine
Ooh, I'm a lucky man, Ooh, I'm a lucky man
It's me and you and you and me
And we're happy as a monkey in a coconut tree
Mississippi watermelon
Cantaloupes, I love to smell 'em
Thinking clearly ain't my trademark
I don't bite quite loud as I bark
Ooh, I'm a lucky man, Ooh, I'm a lucky man
It's me and you and you and me
And we're happy as a monkey in a coconut tree
