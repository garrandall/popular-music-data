Fuck you mean you ain't catching no Uber?
Hell nah I ain't taking yo ass home
Ay where you taking those keys?
Don't touch my keys now

Leave them keys on the counter baby that's my shit
Dang, baby that's my shit
Better call yo ass an Uber baby that's my whip
Fo' real, baby that's my whip
And don't forget it
I'm lucky I ain't buy that shit on credit
I'm lucky I didn't put a ring on something I regretted
I'm lucky now I ain't gotta deal with yo shit
Ya next nigga prolly gonna jump shit fo' real
Ya Mama hit me up the other day again
Told me she need a hunnid dollars for the rent
I told that bitch I'm broke as fuck as far as she know
Because the day before I saw her ass by the casino
I luhh yo pops doe
He's the definition of a real nigga
You should both apologize he gotta deal with yas
But man that nigga should apologize to me
Cuz I put up with yo a till 3

Pack up yo bags, bitch you gotta leave
I ain't got the time to deal with you and yo shit
Hurry yo ass, yo Uber 'bout to leave
I'll even give you 20 bucks towards yo trip
And you could've had it all
You coulda been right here with me watching murder documentaries on Netflix
You could've had it all
But all you got now is a motherfuckin' Uber bill bitch

Man...
I don't think you understand the gravity of the type of girl I was dealing with like...
You know those Instagram models?
You know those instagram models right?

I'm talking 'bout the type of girls with only one concern
How much likes on her last photo. Recognize?
I don't want you here, you should 1, 2 step
All the way out the fuckin' front dow
And to top it off yas chilling by the house she's kissing on yo neck
You go to unbutton those jeans but she say she got respect saying
"I ain't the type of chick who just takes off her clothes quick"
I said, "But then why do you do it for Instgram pics?"
She getting mad as hell like, "You only want me for one thing"
I said, "How been together 3 months and I ain't got that one thing"
She's like, "Well all guys are the same, you're all just thirsty"
"Well why the fuck you try every guy in the first place?"
And ladies don't get me wrong guys are the same busters
Type of dudes that buy Jordans but he still riding the buses
And that nigga got two kids but he always in the club
That's when you hit him up like "Come get your stuff boy"

Pack up yo bags, bitch you gotta leave
I ain't got the time to deal with you and yo shit
Hurry yo ass, yo Uber 'bout to leave
I'll even give you 20 bucks towards yo trip
And you could've had it all
Coulda done cute white people shit like ordering things we can't pronounce from Starbucks
You could've had it all
Yeah that coulda been us

I'ma need that 20 bucks back too
That's like three days of gas money and a pack of bubble gum
You can keep the bubble gum though
Cuz yo breath stank!
