Hot spots
I bang like Little Rock
Step up in the club
And watch the beat stop
Hey shorty
Can you do that dance in my drop, pop that
Make that booty clap like flip flops
Like the Flintstones
We can make the bed rock
Yes this little boy got a house on the hill
Call me Matel
I got so many hot wheels
Now you know what I'm bout
Lets turn this party out
Aight


Everybody put your hands up if you feel me
All the ladies come party with me
Fellas grab your girl
And lets turn this party out


So much sex appeal
Girl that thing canât be real
Baby tell me whatâs the deal
All I wanna know is can we chill
Far from average
Love your bad habits
The way that thing move
You making me want to grab it
Lets leave right now
Lets stop playing around
Thereâs a lot I want to do for you
How does that sound
Youâs a cutie
Scarf over your doobe
Look at that Gucci 
Look good on your booty
What's really good
Can I floss you in my hood
Tell you things
Tell you things that you need i mean knock on wood
So let make it happen
If you want to handle it
Tonight I'm a good man
But tommorrow I'm scandalist
So grab your coat
Let make a exit
And if your moms is home
Girl we hittin da Lexus


Everybody put your hands up if you feel me
All the ladies come party with me
Fellas grab your girl
And lets turn this party out


We donât ride around in trunks
We ride around in Bentley bus
Other crews recognize
Yaâll can't fad us
When Platinum Status droppin heat
Man you already know
B2K and Chris Stokes always equal big doe
We in a 4.6
With 4 Asian chicks
They admiring all this ice around my neck and wrist
Iâm like show me baby girl
How you do dat derre
Gotta dem all saying Fizz can I play in your hair


Check it out
Let me drop dat  knowledge on yâall real quick
A lot of people think B2K is you know what Iâm saying is all about imaging and dancing and
stuff like dat
The people that are talking like dat probably donât have an image
So if you need one
Come to T.U.G we got a lot of dem
We will give you one
Not a problem
Cause we focus man
Once again we focus man
I know I said dat on the last track
But I wanted to get my point across
Round 2 
Raz-B where you at
Right here
