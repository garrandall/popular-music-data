Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Anyway you want it

She loves to laugh
She loves to sing
She does everything
She loves to move
She loves to groove
She loves the lovin' things

It won't be long, yeah, 'til you're alone
When your lover (lover)
Oh, he hasn't come home
'Cause he's lovin' (lovin')
Ooh he's touchin' (touchin')
He's squeezin' another (another)

Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
(She said) any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
(Na na-na na naaa .....)

I was alone
I never knew
What good love could do
Then we touched
Then we sang
About the lovely things

'Cause he's lovin' (lovin)
Ooh he's touchin' (touchin)
He's squeezin' another (another)

Anyway you want it
That's the way you need it
Anyway you want it
(She said) anyway you want it
That's the way you need it
Anyway you want it
(Na na-na na naaa .....)



Anyway you want it
That's the way you need it
Anyway you want it
(He said)
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it

Anyway you want it
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Anyway you want it
(Ooooooh)
(Na na-na na naaa .....)

Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Anyway you want it
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Anyway you want it
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
