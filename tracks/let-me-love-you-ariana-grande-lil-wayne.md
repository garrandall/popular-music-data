I just broke up with my ex
Now I'm out here single, I don't really know what's next
But I ain't even trippin', I'mma chill and sit back
And I know they will be coming from the right and the left, left, left
I just broke up with my ex
You're the one I'm feeling as I'm laying on your chest
Good conversation got me holding my breath
And I don't normally say this but goddamn, you're the best, best, best

And if it feels right, promise I don't mind
And if it feels right, promise I'll stay here all night

Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you

As I'm laying on your chest
I'll be out here thinkin' 'bout it, boy, it's just a guess
But something just keeps telling me I'm better than the rest
And I ain't tryna rush you, but goddamn, I'm a mess, mess, mess

And if it feels right, promise I don't mind
And if it feels right, promise I'll stay here all night

Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you


I say, "Girl, you need a hot boy"
She say, "You need to stop fuckin' with them thots, boy"
I say, "You need a real nigga?" She said, "Yes", Lord
And what you need your ex for? I'm triple X large
Okay, Ariana, my lil mama, goodbye to the good girl
My ex tripping, it's no Biggie, I 2Pac shook her
I'm laid up with my new thing
She lay her head on my new chain
Then the mood change
My name change from Lil Wayne to Oh Wayne
Oh Lord, she grinding on this Grande
Oh Lord, I'm drowning, I'm gonna need that coast guard
And when it comes to that nigga, I give her amnesia
She just looking for love
She says she single and I'm her feature, oh, my God


(You're no good, but it's time I love you, baby)
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Tunechi, Mula baby
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
(But it's time I love you, yeah, yeah, ah)
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
She's looking for love
(I'm looking for love)
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
She's looking for love
(You're looking for love baby)
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
She's looking for love
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
(I'm looking for love babe)
She's just looking for love
She's just looking for love

I'mma give her that love
He gon' gimme that love
She's just looking for love
Boy, I'm looking for love, baby
I'mma give her that love
I'mma give her that...
I'mma give her that...
