In your eyes I see the hurt he left behind
And you're afraid to love and lose a second time
Oh but you and I we got such a beautiful thing
Why'd you want to let it go when it's just beginning to grow


You got to believe in love
You got to believe in love
Open up your heart & baby let the love come in
You got to believe in love
You got to believe in love
Open up your heart & baby let it all begin

Baby you, You're the first real love I found
If you put your trust in me I'll never ever let you down
Oh, not long ago oh I was once left behind
Ya see that's how I know
We gotta long long way to go


Baby just believe
Baby just believe
Baby just believe
Baby just believe
