Jealous heart
Oh, jealous heart stop beating
Can't you see the damage you have done?
You have driven her away forever
Jealous heart, now I'm the lonely one
I was part of everything she planned for
And I know she loved me at the start
Now she hates the side of all I stand for
All because of you, oh, jealous heart
I was part of everything she planned for
And I know she loved me at the start
Now she hates the side of all I stand for
All because of you, oh, jealous heart
