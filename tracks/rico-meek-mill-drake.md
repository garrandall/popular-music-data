Old ways, new women, gotta keep a balance
The girl of your dreams, to me is probably not a challenge
I've been counted out so many times I couldn't count it
Funny how now my accountant is havin' trouble tryna count it
To the people that think that I owe you shit
Payback's a bitch and you know that shit
Y'all niggas gettin' too old for this
Please don't think nobody notices
I've been up for way too many days
Y'all sleep enough for me anyway
Y'all don't be doin' shit anyway
Y'all are not true to this anyway
OVO, East End, Reps Up, we might just get hit with the R.I.C.O
Everyone home for the summer, so let's not do nothing illegal
I go make 50 million then I give some millions to my people
They gon' go Tony Montana and cop them some Shaq at the free throws
But they're from the way fam, there's not much to say fam
They told me to tell you you mans just some wastemans
And stay in your place fam
My dad is from Memphis, and I am the king
I should probably just move in to Graceland
Madonna's a ting I know and I'm the king of pop
I'm building Never-Never Land
How he hate me when I never met the man
We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O.


Meek Milly!
'Cause we in the field with them birds like we play for the Eagles
I'm on probation so let me not talk what's illegal
Switch it up
Today I woke up with my dream girl she rich as a Beatle
For my teachers that said I wouldn't make it here
I spend a day what you make a year
I had to drop this to make it clear
That I got it locked like Jamaican hair
All theses choppers poppin', niggas wildin', violence, why we even got to take it here
Why we even got to play these games
Run up on me catch a fade, you hear?
It's the Chasers what you thought
I come through my block like I'm Rico
Poppin' a wheelie no squealie can't talk to the cops that's illegal
I was like more Rich Porter no double-crossing on my peoples
I take an M to the table and split it with my niggas equal
I'm back on that hood shit
Ya that wish you would shit
I'm talking that cross you that fade you fourth quarter like Jordan we back on that bull shit
We came up from nothing we started on list's most wanted, but now it's the Forbes list
We really was doing shit
I can hear echoes from feds on this beat from informants
I think they recording
Shh listen you hear that


We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O.
We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O.
