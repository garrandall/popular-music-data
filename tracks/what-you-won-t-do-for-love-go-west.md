I guess you wonder where I've been
I searched to find the love within
And I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
But I'm in a daze from your love, you see
And I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go

Some people go around the world for love
But they may never find what they dream of
What you won't do, do for love
You've tried everything but you won't give up
In my world, only you make me do
For love what I would not do

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
But I'm in a daze from your love, you see
And I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go

And though I only want the best it's true
I can't believe the things I do for you
What you won't do, do for love
You've tried everything but you won't give up
In my world, only you make me do
For love what I would not do

What you won't do, do for love
You've tried everything but you won't give up
In my world, only you, only you make me do
For love what I would not do
Make me do for love what I would not do
Make me do for love

What you won't do, do for love
You've tried everything but you won't give up
In my world, only you make me do
