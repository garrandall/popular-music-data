Monday night and I feel so low
I count the hours, but they go so slow
I know the sound of your voice can save my soul
City lights, streets of gold
Look out my window to the world below
Moves so fast, but it feels so cold
And I'm all alone (All alone)
Don't let me die
I'm losing my mind
Baby, just give me a sign


And now that you're gone
I just wanna be with you (Be with you)
And I can't go on
I wanna be with you (Be with you)
Wanna be with you


I can't sleep, I'm up all night
Through these tears, I try to smile
I know the touch of your hand can save my life
But don't let me down
Come to me now
I got to be with you somehow


And now that you're gone
I just wanna be with you (Be with you)
And I can't go on
I wanna be with you (Be with you)
Wanna be with you


Don't let me down
Come to me now


I got to be with you somehow
And now that you're gone
Who am I without you now?
I can't go on
I just wanna be with you (Be with you)


And now that you're gone
Just wanna be with you (Be with you)
And I can't go on
I wanna be with you (Be with you)
Wanna be with you
Now that you're gone
Just wanna be with you
And I can't go on
I wanna be with you


Just wanna be with you
Oh
Just wanna be with you
Just wanna be with you
Just wanna be with you
