Age ain't nothin' but a number
Throwin' down ain't nothin' but a thang
This lovin' I have for you, it'll never change


Here I am, and there you are
Your eyes are callin' me to your heart
All you gotta do is knock and I'll let you in
Then we will feel the passion that flows within
I don't mean to be bold
But I gotta let you know
I got a thing for you and I can't let go


Age ain't nothin' but a number
Throwin' down ain't nothin' but a thang
This lovin' I have for you, it'll never change


Take my hand and come with me
And let me show you true ecstacy
Boy, be brave, don't be afraid
'Cause tonight we're gonna go all the way
I don't mean to be bold
But I gotta let you know
I got a thing for you and I can't let go


Age ain't nothin' but a number
Throwin' down ain't nothin' but a thang
This lovin' I have for you, it'll never change


I don't mean to be bold
But I gotta let you know
Liyah's got a thing for you
And I can't let go
