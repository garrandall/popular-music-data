Warm days, summer nights
Feeling good, coz the mood is right
Every breath, take a chance
Lovin' the sun, lovin' fun

Sometimes you win
Sometimes you lose
It's all about luck
And the love you choose
So hold on tight
If you think it's right
As long as it keeps you satisfied
And singin' (Na na na nah)

Summer lovin'
Summer fun
Layin' low in
In the summer sun
Summer lovin'
Summer fun
Layin' low in
In the summer sun

Summer days
Me and you
Hangin' out between
The green and the blue
Fell in love
Oh so true
Don't want it to end
When the fall begins

Sometimes you win
Sometimes you lose
It's all about luck
And the love you choose
So hold on tight
If you think it's right
As long as it keeps you satisfied
And singin' (Na na na nah)

Summer lovin'
Summer fun
Layin' low in
In the summer sun
Summer lovin'
Summer fun
Layin' low in
In the summer sun

Swingin' on the floor baby
Hey hey (can you dig it)
Can you dig it baby woah yeah

Doodo doo do doo do doo do (Ha ha ha ha ha ha, hah)
Doodo doo do doo do doo do (Ha ha ha ha ha ha, hah)
Doodo doo do doo do doo do (Ha ha ha ha ha ha, hah)
Doodo doo do doo do doo do (Ha ha ha ha ha ha, hah)
Aah shake shake, aah shake
Aah shake shake, aah shake

Na na na nah
Summer lovin'
Summer fun
Layin' low in
In the summer sun
Summer lovin'
Summer fun
Layin' low in
In the summer sun

Sometimes you win
Sometimes you lose
It's all about luck
And the love you choose
So hold on tight
If you think it's right
As long as it keeps you satisfied
And singin'

Na na na nah
Na na na nah, na nah
Na na na nah
Na na na nah, na nah...
