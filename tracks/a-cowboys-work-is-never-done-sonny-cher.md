Ride, I used to jump my horse and ride
I had a six gun at my side
I was so handsome, women cried
And I got shot but never died

I could play, if I do every thing he'd say
Girls just seem to get in his way
Those days we weren't considered fun
A cowboy's work is never done

He'd fight crime all the time
He'd always win,
Till his mom would break it up
And call him in
He was tough he was hard
But he was kind
But he was love, cause guys like him
Were hard to find

Ride, I like to ride again some day
I think I still know how to play
I'd play games now but it's not fun
A cowboy's work is never done
