It started one night in Milano
A candlelight dinner, Italian style
We danced and she whispered "Ti Amo"
Morning came, and we had to say
"Good bye, so hold me once more
Good bye and kiss me one more time
Just one more time"
Save your love
Until I will return
Let the flames of fire burn
In your heart, forever
Save your love
Don't give it to someone new
Everything is up to you
Till I'm back forever
She gave me one night of devotion
Fire of love was burning inside
I couldn't escape my emotions
And I nearly died, when we had to say
"Good bye, I want you to stay
Goodbye so please come back one day
Come back some day"
Save your love
Until I will return
Let the flames of fire burn
In your heart, forever
Save your love
Don't give it to someone new
Everything is up to you
Till I'm back forever
(I'm so in love with you. It's the first time I felt this
Way. I promise. I wait for you.)
Save your love
Until I will return
Let the flames of fire burn
In your heart, forever
Save your love
Don't give it to someone new
Everything is up to you
Till I'm back forever
Save your love
Until I will return...
