Woah, oh, ho, just like a yo-yo
Woah, oh, ho, just like a yo-yo

Well, it's hard for me to see
How you got such a hold on me
First I'm up and then I'm down
Then my heart goes around and around

Well, I'll bet you five dollars
I'm the only fool who will
Climb up a string for you

Oh, yeah, and need I say
I can't break away
You control every
Little thing I do

I used to be a swinger
Til you wrapped me
Round your finger

Just like a yo-yo
Just like a yo-yo

Turning, turning
Love keeps burning
Like a fire in my heart
When were apart but
When were back together
You keep changing like
The weather, whoops, now

Oh, yeah, like a yo-yo
Oh, just like a yo-yo
Heard what he said
Like a yo-yo
Oh, just like a yo-yo

Where I go and what I do
Well, it all just depends on you
You build me up just to let me down
But I dare not to make a sound

Cause I'm so afraid
You will cast me away
Like a beat up, worn out toy

So I hold on tight
With all my might just
To be your loving boy, yeah

No matter what they say or do
I gotta bounce right
Back to you now
Just like a yo-yo
Just like a yo-yo

Turning, turning
Love keeps burning
Like a fire in my heart
When were apart but
When were back together
You keep changing like
The weather, whoops, now

Oh, yeah, like a yo-yo
Oh, just like a yo-yo......
