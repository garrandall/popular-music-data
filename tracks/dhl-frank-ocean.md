Love that I, love that I give
That is not all that I give up
Uh, uh-huh
Love that I, love that I give
Uh-huh, uh-huh, huh
That is not all that I give up

Look at them shakes, uh-huh
Made up a dance
How come you shook?
But I ain't took out my hands
Beans, Starbucks, starstruck
Bitch comin' soon, yeah, that's 'cause you suck, yeah
(Suck me off, suck me off, suck me off
Suck me off, suck me off, suck me off)
That's comin' soon, yeah (Suck my dick, huh)
I'm in my bag
I'm in my bag, stay on alert
I'm going on-stage, 'cause all of my chains diving deep off
Findin' the key, put it in, Kawasaki
Totin' the Amazon (Amazon)
Shit like 6'5" (Shit like 6'5")
Take back, rewind, now I rewind
Ooh, ooh, baby be mine (Baby be mine)
Ooh, ooh, baby be mine

Got a pack, came from DHL
Just got up with a pack
Got a pack, came from DHL
Just got up like a pill
Got a pack, fuckin' with Saturday night chill
Just got up off of a pack (I got a pack)
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
I got a pack, came from DHL
I got a shot at the pill
I got a pack, came from DHL
Just got up on a pill
Count it up

Niggas think it's new, it ain't new, boy
Old files just turned two, yeah, flu, yeah
Still sound like it's comin' soon, comin' soon, yeah
Still sound like it's comin' soon, tell the truth
Boy toy suck me like a Hoover, like a Hoover
Boy toy ride me like a Uber, like the Uber
Smiley face, factory casing, ain't buss it down, yeah
I love it
I forgave it, violations, ain't seen 'em around, yeah
Could test it, wavy pool, sit behind the pool
I'm tellin' the truth, bro
Remind me of trade, brushin' his waves
Shit look like ramen noodles
Fuck, this shit sound like it's comin' soon, comin' soon, bro
And it still sound like it's comin' soon, comin' soon
New files sittin' on my drive, nothin' new, yeah
New vibes and I can't get down, what you do, yeah
New vibes, really can't get down to the pool, yeah
New gliss sittin' on the cyst, on my wrist, yeah
New bitch ridin' on my dick like a kick, yeah
All in the day and I paid for the studio rate, instead of the rent, yeah
Now I can hang in this bitch every day waitin' for some inspiration to hit me
Look like I'm dressed for a hike but I really look like I'm in Paris and shit, yeah
Look like I'm dressed for a camp 'cause I'm pitchin' up that, like I'm pitchin' a tent, yeah
This ain't no fuckin' hopes and dreams, prophecy
All these sleeve wafers and the coffee bean
Roman numerals, niggas wanna buy me, we exposed
Double D's exposed, throw some beats
Fuckin' these hoes, leave, now my fuckin' floor stores
Move me slow, yes
Roofie tea, ice ecstasy, rollin'
You seen my bag, it's swollen, I want more, I can't even fold it
I drop you a pin like I'm bowling
You want it so now you my opponent
Breakfast and dinner is plenty, we spend all that time alone, alone
Watchin' the clouds roll, woah

I got a pack, came from the DHL
Just got up with a pack
I got a pack, came from the DHL
Just got up with a pack
I got a pack, oh, a pack, yeah
Just got up with a pack
I got a pack, oh, DHL
Just got up on a pill
There it is woo
I got a pack, came from the DHL
Just got up with a pack
I got a pack, came out with DHL
Chick just came up with a pack
I got a pack, came out with DHL
Chick just got up with a pack
I got a pack, over at DHL
Chick just got up with a pack

Independent jug, sellin' records out the trunk
I'm already rich as fuck so the products in the front
Got my partner in the front, been my BF for a month
But we been fuckin' from the jump
