Let me be your lovemaker
Let me be your soul shaker
Let me be your lovemaker
Let me be your soul shaker

Around this time last summer
When you and I first met
I thought I was cool
Living by the rules
Trying to play hard to get

So you found some good-time guy
To give you the love you needed
I didn't know a thing
About what thrills love could bring
I was young, selfish, and conceited

I know you don't think I'm ready
But open your eyes and see
As sure as my heart is beating
I can love away your misery

Let me be your lovemaker
Let me be your soul shaker
Let me be your lovemaker
Let me be your soul shaker

I know you don't think I'm ready
But open your eyes and see
As sure as my heart is beating
I can love away your misery

Let me be your lovemaker
Let me be your soul shaker
Let me be your lovemaker
Let me be your soul shaker

About this time last year
I was blind to all the good things you said
The sweet words you spoke
I took them for a joke
Though they were strong enough to raise the dead

So you thought you'd wasted
Both your time and mine
But now I'm ready to do what you want me to
I'm your man and I ain't lyin'

Let me be your lovemaker
Let me be your soul shaker
Let me be your lovemaker
Let me be your soul shaker
