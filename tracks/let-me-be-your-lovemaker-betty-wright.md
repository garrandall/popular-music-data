Let me be your lovemaker
Let me be your soul shaker
Let me be your lovemaker
Let me be your soul shaker

Around this time last summer
When you and I first met
I thought I was cool
Living by the rules
Trying to play hard to get

So you found some good-time chick
To give you the love you needed
I didn't know a thing
About the thrills love could bring
I was young, selfish, and conceited

I know you don't think I'm ready
But open your eyes and see
As sure as my name is Betty
I can love away all your misery!

Let me be your lovemaker
Let me be your soul shaker
Why don't ya, Let me be your lovemaker
Let me be your soul shaker

About this time last year
I was blind to all the good things you said
The sweet words you spoke
I took them for a joke
Though they were strong enough raise the dead!

So you thought you wasted
Both your time and mine
But now I'm ready to do
What you want me to
Cause I'm your woman
And I ain't Lyin'

I know you don't think I'm ready, Ooo oo
But open your eyes and see
As sure as my name is Betty
I can love away all your misery HEE!

So, Let me (umh) be your lovemaker ( I need to be)
Let me be your soul shaker (umh)
Why don't ya, Let me be your lovemaker
Let me be your soul shaker

Why don't let me be it baby
Why don't ya let me be - Wooh OH
I wanna be, I got ta got ta be
Ooooooooo

Won't it be nice baby
If ya let me be your love maker
Let me be good to ya

Honey, Honey, Yahhhhh!
