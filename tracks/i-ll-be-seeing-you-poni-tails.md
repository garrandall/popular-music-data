I'll be seeing you in
All the old familiar places
That this heart of mine
Embraces all day through

In that small cafe
The park across the way
The children's carousel
The chestnut trees
The wishing well

I'll be seeing you in
Every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you

I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you
