When the night has come, oh yeah
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see

I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
Not as long, not as long as you stand by me

Sometimes I sit down and I wonder
I sit down and I wonder baby
I wonder if you love me
Do you love me like you say you?

You know a friend of mine Jackie Wilson might say
"puh-leeees don't go"
Jackie Wilson might say
"puh-leeees don't go"
Oh my darlin' won't you stand by me

David Ruffin of The Temptaions might say
"I got sunshine on a cloudy day"
"When it's cold outside I've even got the month of May"

Billy Stewart might say
"A-baby a-baby a-baby"
"A-won't you tell me a-tell me a-tell me"
"A-hope you tell me now my darlin'"
"I said a-right now"
Oh yeah
Oh my darling won't you stand by me

Smokey Robinson from the Miracles might say
"I will build you a castle with a tower so high"
"It reaches the moon"
"I'll gather melodies from birds that fly"

Chuck Jackson might say
"Any day now"
"Don't fly away, my beautiful bird"
Baby, baby, baby"
Oh my darling won't you stand by me

But my name is Spyder Turner and I'll get down on my knees and say
"Darling... don't go"
"You know that I need your love so doggone bad"
"Oh yeah, c'mon girl and stand by me"
"Whenever I'm in trouble won't you stand..."
"C'mon and stand..."
