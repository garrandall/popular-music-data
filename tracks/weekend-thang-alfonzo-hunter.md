I go and see her
When I need some loving
She's not afraid to give me
All of her affection
Oh, I know she's got
A treat for me
After working hard all week
Her pretty face, I need to see

So I (jump in the rover)
Yeah (I'm coming over)
Soon as I get to her
She knows what to do
And what I want, hey

(She gives me good love)
Oh, yes, she does
(Kisses and warm hugs)
Baby, I need all your love
She's my weekend thang

It's Friday night
The mood is right
Sing all through the night
She's my weekend thang
(She's my weekend thang)

When I need mad loving
I know where to go
Baby got a freaky flow
She's my weekend thang
(She's my weekend thang)

She greets me with a kiss
And says hello
She pulls me in and takes
My coat off nice and slow

The fireplace is burning
For her love, I'm yearning
And her sweet perfume
Fills the room

Oh, it's the way that she walks
The way that she talks
The softness of her lips
Her tender kiss

I need all her love
I need her touch
She's my weekend thang

It's Friday night
The mood is right
Sing all through the night
She's my weekend thang
(She's my weekend thang)
When I need mad loving
I know where to go
Baby got a freaky flow
She's my weekend thang
(She's my weekend thang)

It's Friday night
The mood is right
(Yeah, yeah)
Sing all through the night
She's my weekend thang
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

When I need mad loving
I know where to go
(Crazy mad loving)
Baby got a freaky flow
She's my weekend thang

I know where I can get it
I know where to be, yeah

It's Friday night
The mood is right (oh, yeah)
Sing all through the night

She's my weekend thang
