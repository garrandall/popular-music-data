I can see that you've been crying
You can't hide it with a lie
What's the use in you denying
That what you have is wrong?
I heard him promise you forever
But forever's come and gone
Baby, he would say whatever
It takes to keep you blind
To the truth between the lines


Oh, I will love you more than that
I won't say the words, then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby, listen to me when I say
I will love you more than that


Baby, you deserve much better
What's the use in holding on?
Don't you see it's now or never
'Cause I just can't be friends
Baby, knowing in the end


That I will love you more than that
I won't say the words, then take them back
(Can't take them back)
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby, listen to me when I say


There's not a day that passes by
I don't wonder why we haven't tried
It's not too late to change your mind
So take my hand, don't say goodbye
I will love you more than that
I won't say the words, then take them back


I will love you more than that
I won't say the words, then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby, listen to me when I say
I will love you more than that
I will love you more than that (more than that)
I won't say the words, then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby, listen to me when I say
I will love you more than that
