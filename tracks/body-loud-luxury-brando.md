Everybody knows I'm live
(Candela)
Everybody knows I'm fire
(Candela)
Go ahead and slip I'll slide
All up in your B-O-D-Y

Babe, don't make a sound
2 A.M. love gotta keep it down (keep it down)
Don't wait around for a signal now
Gimme some verbs I ain't talkin' nouns (I'm naughty)
You want a ride in the six
You want a dine in the six (dine in the six)
When I lean for the kiss
You said I'll probably send you some pics
And I'm like

Hell nah, been waitin' too long (I've been waitin')
Brando
Hell nah, I want that crew love (don't leave, baby)
(Nicky Nicky Jam)
Hell nah, been waitin' too long (I've been waitin')
(Loud Luxury)
Hell nah, I want that crew love
(Mr. Worldwide)

Body on my, losin' all my innocence, yeah
Body on my, grindin' on my innocence, yeah
Body on my, losin' all my innocence, yeah
Body on my, grindin' on my innocence, yeah

Eeeeeyyyyyoooooo

She got the body of a goddess
Booty so big you can see if from the front I want to ride it
Baby you exotic
Mami gotta be a chiropractor the way she break necks with that body
La di da di
We came to party
305 look what we started
We gon' slide, go, hey shawty
We gon' ride, go, hey shawty
Now give me that

Crew love, that cool love, get naked mama
Tu papi chulo, bien duro, te lo quiere dar
I want that crew love, that cool love, get naked mama
Tu papi chulo, bien duro, te lo quiere dar

Hell nah, been waitin' too long (I've been waitin')
Hell nah, I want that crew love (don't leave, baby)
Hell nah, been waitin' too long (I've been waitin')
Hell nah, I want that crew love

Body on my, losin' all my innocence, yeah
Body on my, grindin' on my innocence, yeah

I need you baby you got me waiting too long (been waitin' to long)
Yo quiero darte bien duro esa canciÃ³n
I like how you look in my bed (eh)
Y como lo haces bebe (eh)
The way that you're moving your body
I know that you're naughty
The way that you flex

I want that crew love, that cool love, get naked mama
Tu papi chulo, bien duro, te lo quiere dar
I want that crew love, that cool love, get naked mama
Tu papi chulo, bien duro, te lo quiere dar

Hell nah, been waitin' too long (I've been waitin')
Hell nah, I want that crew love (don't leave, baby)
Hell nah, been waitin' too long (I've been waitin')
Hell nah, I want that crew love

Body on my, losin' all my innocence, yeah
Body on my, grindin' on my innocence, yeah
Body on my, losin' all my innocence, yeah
