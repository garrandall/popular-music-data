She was only a child
Someone to hold on
Only a child
Someone to believe in
Only a child
Someone to love

She was 17
Beauty queen
I met her in a magazine
Heart of fire
Love's desire
Reachin' out higher, higher

Run away
One more day
A broken-hearted child at play
I pray for you, baby blue
In the name of love I reach for you
In the darkness comes the evil of the night
Think about it

You better wait
Stop yourself before you fall
You better wait
Stop before you lose it all
Somewhere there's love
Oh, somewhere, some way

Precious girl
Little pearl
Temptation is lonely world
Eyes deceive
They believe
In everything they wanna see, yeah
And the neon lights reflect your life
Only you know where you hide, baby

You better wait
Stop yourself before you fall
You better wait
Stop before you lose it all
'Cause somewhere there's love

You better wait
Stop yourself before you start
You better wait
Don't look back
Don't lose heart

Don't look
Don't look
Don't look back, babe

Don't
Don't look
Don't look
Don't look back, baby
