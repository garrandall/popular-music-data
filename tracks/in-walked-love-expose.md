Once, there were stars out in the night
That never seemed to shine
And love was there for every heart
Seemed every heart but mine

That's how it seemed to be
Then, darling, you changed everything
Just when I thought I'd given up
Out walked loneliness

CHORUS:
In walked love, in walked you
In walked all my dreams a-coming true
(In walked love) Right through my door
I saw your face and I knew
All I looked for, I had found in you
I had found the one that I'd been dreaming of, oh
In walked love

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I tossed my heart into the wind
I had thrown all hope away
That love would ever let me in
And then, you came my way

Just like a ray of light (just like a ray)
That breaks through the long, cold night
You brought in a brand-new morning sun
Out walked loneliness

CHORUS

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

GUITAR SOLO

And now, I feel (now, I feel)
How it feels to feel alive (feels to feel alive)
Just one touch and I knew
And I knew

CHORUS

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

In walked love, in walked you
In walked all my dreams a-coming true
(repeat and fade out)
