If you ever change your mind
About leaving, leaving me behind
Baby, bring it to me, bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me
Yea
(Yea)
Yea
(Yea)
Yea
(Yea)
I know I laughed when you left
But now I know, I only hurt myself
Baby, bring it to me, bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me
Yea
(Yea)
Yea
(Yea)
Yea
(Yea)
I'll give you jewelry and money too
That ain't all, that ain't all, I'd do for you
Baby, if you bring it to me, bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me
Yea
(Yea)
Yea
(Yea)
Yea
(Yea)
You know, I'll always be your slave
'Til I'm buried, buried in my grave
Oh honey, bring it to me, bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me
Yea
(Yea)
Yea
(Yea)
Yea
(Yea)
One more thing, I tried to treat you right
But you stayed out, stayed out late at night
But I forgive you
(I)
Bring it to me, bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me
Yea
(Yea)
Yea
(Yea)
Yea
(Yea)
Yea

Yea
(Yea)
