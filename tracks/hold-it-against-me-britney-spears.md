Hey, over there
Please, forgive me
If I'm comin' on too strong
Hate to stare
But, you're winnin'
And they're playin' my favorite song
So, so come here
A little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear
A little question
Wanna know just how you feel


If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause, you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

Hey, you might think
That I'm crazy
But, you know I'm just your type
I might be
A little hazy
But, you know you can't deny
There's a spark
In between us
When we're dancin' on the floor
I want more
Wanna see it
So, I'm askin' you tonight


If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause, you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

If I said I 
If I said I
Would you hold it against me?
If I said I 
If I said I
Would you hold it against me?

If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
