One day you may find true love that will last forever and ever
'Till then you'll spend a lifetime wishing one together
You never thought she'd say goodbye
And you'll never understand the reasons why

Heart of mine
How will you keep from dying
Stop reminiscing who is she kissing?
Heart of mine
Oh what's the use in trying
No one can mend you now

Love plays cruel games
You can't believe she's found another lover
"Does she miss me?"
Sometimes you just can't help but wonder
No, you can't hold the hands of time
And you'll always be the one she left behind

Heart of mine, how will you keep from dying stop reminiscing
Who is she kissing heart of mine,
Oh what's the use in trying
No one can mend you now

And you'll never understand the reasons why
Heart of mine, how will you keep from dying stop reminiscing
Who is she kissing heart of mine,
Oh, what's the use in trying
No one can mend you now
Oh, heart of mine heart of mine
Heart of mine
