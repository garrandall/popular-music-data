I want you the right way
I want you
But I want you to want me too
Want you to want me, baby
Just like I want you

I give you all the love I want in return sweet darling
But half a love is all I feel
It's too bad, it's just too sad, you don't want me now
But I'm going to change your mind, someway, somehow, oh baby

I want you the right way
I want you
But I want you to want me too
I want you to want me, baby
Just like I want you

This one way love is just a fantasy, oh sugar
To share is precious, pure and fair
Don't play with something you should cherish for life, oh baby
Don't you want to care? Ain't it lonely out there?

I want you the right way
I want you
But I want you to want me too
I want you to want me, baby
When I get down with you, yes, darlin oh ooh

Get down baby
Have mercy
Listen precious I wanted you
A long time
I wanted you
More than you can imagine
Oh baby, so fine
I want you the right way baby
I want you baby
But I want you to want me too baby
Gotta, gotta, gotta love me sugar
Oh, the way that I love you
Woooo, I want you
