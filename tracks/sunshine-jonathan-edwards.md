You are my sunshine
You are my only sunshine
And you make me happy
When them old Cambridge skies are grey, yeah
And you ain't never gonna know, darling
How much I really love you
Ain't that the prettiest thing?
But please don't take my sunshine ever away

Sunshine, go away today
I don't feel much like dancing
Some man gone and tried to run my life
He don't know what he's asking
When he tells me I better get in line
I can't hear a word he's saying
When I grow up, I'm gonna make it mine
Oh, these ain't been dues I been paying

How much does it cost?
I'll buy it
The time is all we've lost
I'll try it
He can't even run his own life
Damned if he'll run mine, sunshine

Sunshine, go away today
I don't feel much like dancing
Some man gone and tried to run my life
He don't know what he's asking
Working starts to make me wonder where
The fruits of what I do are going
When he said in love and war, all is fair
But Nixon got cards he ain't showing

How much does it cost?
I'll buy it
The time is all we've lost
I'll try it
And he can't even run his own life
Damned if he'll run mine, sunshine

Sunshine, come on back another day
I promise you I'll be singing
This old world, she's gonna turn around
And brand new bells had better be ring, hear them ringing, yeah

Thank you very much
Al Anderson, Orphan, Stuart Schulman, Bill Keith, Bill Elliot
All you people, thank you
