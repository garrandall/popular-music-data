Her name is Lola
She was a showgirl
With yellow feathers in her hair
And a dress cut down to there
She would merengue
And do the cha-cha
And while she tried to be a star
Tony always tended bar
Across the crowded floor
They worked from eight til' four
They were young and they had each other
Who could ask for more?

At the copa
Copacabana
The hottest spot north of havana
Here at the copa
Copacabana
Music and passion
Were always the fashion
At the copa
They fell in love...

His name was Rico
He wore a diamond
He was escorted to his chair
He saw lola dancing there
And when she finished
He called her over
But rico went a bit too far
Tony sailed across the bar
And then the punches flew
And chairs were smashed in two
There was blood and a single gun shot
But just who shot who?

At the copa
Copacabana
The hottest spot north of havana
At the copa
Copacabana
Music and passion
Were always the fashion
At the copa
She lost her love

Her name is lola
She was a showgirl
But that was many years ago
When they use to have a show
Now it's a disco
But not for lola
Still in the dress she use to wear
Faded feathers in her hair
She sits there so refined
And drinks herself half blind
She lost her youth
And she lost her tony
Now she's lost her mind

At the copa
Copacabana
The hottest spot north of havana
At the copa
Copacabana
Music and passion
Were always the fashion
At the copa
Don't fall in love...
