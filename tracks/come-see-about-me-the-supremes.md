I have been crying cause I'm lonely (for you)
Smiles have all turned to tears
But tears won't wash away the fears
That you're never ever gonna return
To ease the fire that within me burns

It keeps me crying baby for you
I keep on sighing, baby for you
I won't you hurry
Come on boy, see about me (come see about me)
See about you baby (come see about me)

I've given up my friends just for you
My friends are gone and you have too
No peace shall I find until you come back boy
And be mine, no matter what you do or say
I'm gonna love you anyway

It keep on crying baby for you
I keep on sighing, baby for you
So won't you hurry?
Come on boy, see about me (come see about me)
See about you baby (come see about me)

Sometime's I'm up, sometime's I'm down
My life's so uncertain with you not around
From my arms you maybe out of reach
But my heart says you're here to keep

It keeps me crying baby for you
I keep on crying baby for you
So won't you hurry
Come on boy, see about me (come see about me)
See about you baby (come see about me)
see about me (come see about me)
See about you baby (come see about me)
Hurry, hurry baby
