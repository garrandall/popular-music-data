Come to Me
When You're all alone and feeling down
Come to Me
When there's nobody else around
Come to Me
I'm still waiting,opened armed for You
Come to Me
Cause I will comfort You
When You've no one to turn to
I will be here just for You

Come to Me
When Your world is empty and cold
Come to Me
When You need someone You want to hold
Come to Me
In My arms I will keep You safe and warm
Come to Me
I will shelter You from the storm
I'm not one to pretend
Why can't You understand

Chorus:
That I love You and I love You
And I need You and I want You
And I love You and I love You
And I need You
And I want You, come to Me

I'm a lonely man
Living in a world of dreams
I've got everything
But the one thing that I really need
Come to Me
I'll give You all the love You need
Cause I have love just for You

Repeat Verse 2

Repeat Chorus and fade
