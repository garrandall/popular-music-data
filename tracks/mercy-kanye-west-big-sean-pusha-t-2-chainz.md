Well, it is a weepin' and a moanin' and a gnashin' of teeth
It is a weepin' and a mournin' and a gnashin' of teeth
It is a—when it comes to my sound which is the champion sound
Believe, believe

O-o-o-o-o-okay, Lamborghini Mercy
Your chick, she so thirsty
I-I-I-I-I'm in that two-seat Lambo
With your girl, she tryna jerk me (Believe)
O-o-o-o-o-okay, Lamborghini Mercy
Your chick, she so thirsty
I-I-I-I-I'm in that two-seat Lambo
With your girl, she tryna jerk me
O-o-o-o-o-okay, Lamborghini Mercy (Swerve)
Your chick, she so thirsty (Swerve)
I-I-I-I-I'm in that two-seat Lambo
With your girl, she tryna jerk me (Woah, believe)
O-o-o-o-o-okay, Lamborghini Mercy
Your chick, she so thirsty (Boy)
I-I-I-I-I'm in that two-seat Lambo (Boy)
With your girl, she tryna jerk me

Okay, drop it to the floor, make that ass shake (Shake, shake)
Woah, make the ground move: that's an ass quake
Built a house up on that ass: that's an ass-state
Roll–roll–roll my weed on it: that's an ass tray
Say, Ye, say, Ye, don't we do this every day–day? (Huh?)
I work them long nights, long nights to get a payday (Huh?)
Finally got paid, now I need shade and a vacay
And niggas still hatin'
So much hate, I need a AK (AK)
Now we out in Paris, yeah, I'm Perrierin'
White girls politickin': that's that Sarah Palin
Get–get–get–get–get–gettin' hot, Californicatin'
I give her that D, 'cause that's where I was born and raised in

O-o-o-o-o-okay, Lamborghini Mercy (Swerve)
Your chick, she so thirsty (Swerve)
I-I-I-I-I'm in that two-seat Lambo (Swerve)
With your girl, she tryna jerk me (Swerve, believe)

Well, it is a weepin' and a moanin' (Swerve)
And a gnashin' of teeth (Swerve)
It is a weepin' and a mournin' (Swerve)
And a gnashin' of teeth (Swerve)
It is a—when it comes to my sound (Swerve)
Which is the champion sound (Swerve)
Believe, believe (Swerve)
Believe, believe (Swerve)

Yuugh! It's prime time, my top back, this pimp game, ho
I'm red leather, this cocaine, I'm Rick James, ho
I'm bill-droppin', Ms. Pac-Man, this pill-poppin' ass ho
I'm poppin' too, these blue dolphins need two coffins
All she want is some heel money
All she need is some bill money
He take his time, he counts it out
I weighs it up, that's real money
Check the neck, check the wrist
Them heads turnin': that's exorcist
My Audemars like Mardi Gras
That's Swiss time, and that's excellence
Two-door preference
Roof gone, George Jefferson
That white frost on that pound cake
So your Duncan Hines is irrelevant, woo
Lambo Murciélago
She go wherever I go
Wherever we go, we do it pronto, it's like

O-o-o-o-o-okay, Lamborghini Mercy (Swerve)
Your chick, she so thirsty (Swerve)
I-I-I-I-I'm in that two-seat Lambo (Swerve)
With your girl, she tryna jerk me (Swerve, believe)

And a gnashin' of teeth (Swerve)
It is a—when it comes to my sound (Swerve)
Which is the champion sound (Swerve)
Believe, believe (Swerve)
Believe (Swerve)

Well, it is a weepin' and a moanin'
And a gnashin' of teeth in the dancehall
And who no have teeth gwan rub pon dem gums
Cuh when time it comes to my sound
Which is the champion sound
The bugle has blown fi many times
And it still have one more time left
Cuh the amount of stripe weh deh pon our shoulder

Let the suicide doors up
I threw suicides on the tour bus
I threw suicides on the private jet
You know what that mean, I'm fly to death
I step in Def Jam buildin' like I'm the shit
Tell 'em gimme fifty million or I'ma quit
Most rappers' taste level ain't at my waist level
Turn up the bass 'til it's up-in-yo-face level
Don't do no press but I get the most press kit
Plus, yo, my bitch make your bitch look like Precious
Somethin' 'bout Mary, she gone off that molly
Now the whole party is melting like Dalí
Now everybody is movin' they body
Don't sell me apartment, I'll move in the lobby (Yah)
Niggas is loiterin' just to feel important
You gon' see lawyers and niggas in Jordans (2 Chainz)

Okay, now catch up to my campaign
Coupe the color of mayonnaise
I'm drunk and high at the same time
Drinkin' champagne on the airplane (Tell 'em)
Spit rounds like a gun range (Baow)
Beat it up like Rampage
Hundred bands, cut your girl
Now your girl need a Band-Aid (Damn)
Grade A, A1
Chain the color of Akon
Black diamonds, backpack rhymin'
Co-signed by Louis Vuitton (Yep)
Horsepower, horsepower
All this Polo on, I got horsepower
Pound of this cost four thousand
Now I make it rain, she want more showers
Rain (Rain) pourin' (Pourin')
All my cars is foreign (Foreign)
All my broads is foreign (Foreign)
Money tall like Jordan

O-o-o-o-o-okay, Lamborghini Mercy (Swerve)
Your chick, she so thirsty (Swerve)
I-I-I-I-I'm in that two-seat Lambo (Swerve)
With your girl, she tryna jerk me (Swerve)
