If I could save time in a bottle
The first thing that I'd like to do
Is to save every day till eternity passes away
Just to spend them with you

If I could make days last forever
If words could make wishes come true
I'd save every day like a treasure and then
Again, I would spend them with you

But there never seems to be enough time
To do the things you wanna do, once you find them
Once you find them
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I wanna go through time with
Through time with

If I had a box just for wishes
And dreams that had never come true
The box would be empty, except for the memory
Of how they were answered by you

If I could save time in a bottle
The first thing that I'd like to do
Is to save every day till eternity passes away
Just to spend them with you

There never seems to be time
To do the things you want, once you find them
Once you find them
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I wanna go through time with
Through time with

But there never seems to be enough time
To do the things you want to do, once you find them
Once you find them
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I wanna go through time with
Through time with
