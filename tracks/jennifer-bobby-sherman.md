Funny how so many moments slip away
The things I meant to say
I should have said them all before today
To Jennifer, Jennifer

Funny how you'd smile and always understand
When I got out of hand
Have you forgotten all the fun we planned
My Jennifer, Jennifer?

And now you think you're getting in my way
And all I want to do is find you, and remind you
Even if I may become a star someday
I'd give it all away
If it meant that I couldn't always stay
With Jennifer, Jennifer

So now I'm begging you to come back home
You'll never have to be alone
We'll be as we were
My Jennifer
