Ride on Josephine, ride on
Ride on Josephine baby ride on
Ride on Josephine, you got a runnin' machine
Baby, ride on Jospehine, baby ride on

Josephine's a-drivin' a hot rod Ford
Flat-top that'll really eat up the road
One leg's up, sticking out the rear
Something that really take it away from here
Ride on Josephine, ride on
Ride on Josephine, ride on
Ride on Josephine, you got a runnin' machine
Baby, ride on Josephine, baby ride on

Josephine's Ford is a-gettin' real hot
She tried to trade it in at a used car lot
Man couldn't believe his natural eyes
When she put it into the drive
Ride on Josephine, ride on
Ride on Josephine, ride on
Ride on Josephine, you got a runnin' machine
Baby, ride on Josephine, baby ride on

I'm drivin a fourty-eight Cadillac with Thunderbird wings
I tell you baby, it's the running thing
Get your groove, baby get in gear
Something that take it away from here
Ride on Josephine, ride on
Ride on Josephine, ride on
Ride on Jospehine, you got a runnin' machine
Baby, ride on Jospehine, baby ride on

Ride on Josephine, ride on
Ride on Josephine, ride on
Ride on Josephine, you got a runnin' machine
