Wooow, hey
Mmm mmm mmm mmm

You can have your Cajun queens
Down in New Orleans
And take the movie stars
Who drive impress me more cars

Take your high class show and tell
Don't need no modern day Jezebel
All I want, ain't no lie
Check it out, Leroy
They breeze by

Wish I had a girl who
Walked like that, oh yeah
Wish I had that girl, uh huh
Wish I had a girl who
Walked like that, yeah
Wish I had that girl, yeah

That's it, that's it, ha ha

(Have mercy)
Woo, have mercy, woo
Come on

You can have your socialites
Mmm, caviar, honey, champagne nights

Me, I'll take the nine to five stuff
Oh, and I'll tell you what

Me, I'll take what I can now
So you know it's hard to understand
Not all it takes to satisfy
Check it out, Leroy, they breeze by

Wish I had a girl who
Walked like that, oh yeah
Wish I had that girl, uh huh
Hey, wish I had a girl
Who walked like that, yeah

Well, I wish I had a girl like that
And I'd take her home and
Walk her all night long, yeah

Hey, hey, hey

Oh, yeah (have mercy)
Mmm, have mercy (oh yeah)

I wish I had a (had a, had a)
I wish I had a (had a, had a)
I wish I had a girl
