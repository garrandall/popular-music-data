Come on and tell me that I’m wrong
Now you know just how I feel
Show me how to be strong
Girl, I need you more day by day

Let your heart take a chance
Ain’t you tired of foolin’ yourself ?
Give it what it wants
We’ll love like everyone else

It’s only natural
That you won’t be free
But how can I do when nothin’s feelin’ ?

Tell me that I’m wrong
Now you know just how I feel
Show me how to be strong
Girl, I need you more day by day

I got that Sunday morning feeling
You’ve hit me hard
I know you’ve found it too now
It’s the same old man, it ain’t nothin’ new

You are the happiness that I longed
That I longed for
But most of all
Now I want you more than, yeah, yeah

Tell me that I’m wrong
Tell me that I believe the love is strong
I‘ve got that Sunday morning feeling
Lord, there’s got to be, there’s got to be, got to be
Got to be, there’s got to be
I need you more day by day, day by day
Girl, I need you more day by day
