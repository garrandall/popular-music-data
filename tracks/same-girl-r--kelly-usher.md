Yo Ush

What up Kells

Wanna introduce you to this girl. Think I really love this girl.

Man she's so fine.

Straight up dog

She stands about 5'4", Coca Cola, red bone

Damn

She drives a black Durango
License plate say "Angel".
What?
Tattoo on her ankle
Plus she's making pesos.

Got a crib on Peachtree, Peachtree,
Right on 17th street
And I call her "TeTe".


Wait a minute hold on dog. Do she got a kid?
Yep
She loves some waffle house?
Yep
Do she got a beauty mark on the left side of her mouth?
Man
Went to Georgia Tech?
Yep
Works for TBS?
Yep
Man I can't believe this shit. Damn!


Tell me what's wrong dog what the hell you damnin' 'bout?
I'm your homie so just say what's on your mind.


Man I didn't know that you were talkin' 'bout her.

So man you telling me you know her?

Do I know her? Like a pastor know his word.

We messing with the same girl, the same girl.

How could the love of my life
And my potential wife
Be the same girl the same girl?

Man I can't believe that we've been messing with the same girl, the same girl.

Thought she's someone I could trust
But she's been doubling up with us.
U, K, man we been messing with same girl.


See I met her at this party in Atlanta!

Well I met her at this party in Chicago!

She came right up to me giving me conversation.
I said, "Do you got a man?"
She said, "No," with no hesitation.

Well, it must be a music thing
'Cause she said the same to me.
At party all in my face
While I'm laughing and buying her drinks


She whispered in my ear and said, "Can you take me home?"

Me too! Man she was in the Chi singing that same song

Is that true?

And I thought it was true confessions when she said, "I love you."

Man I thought her body was calling when she said, "I want you."
Look I even got some pictures on my phone.

Look at there. There she is with some boy shorts on.

We messing with the same girl, the same girl.
She's the apple of my eye
And my potential wife.
The same girl, same girl.
Man I just can't believe that we've been messing around with the same damn girl.
The same girl, same girl.
Thought she was someone I could trust
But she's been doubling up with both of us.
U, K man we been messing with the same girl.


Said she got me on a ring tone

Are you talking about the pink phone?

Uh uh the blue one

Man she told me that was turned off.

It's obvious that she's been playing us, playing us.

'Cause constantly she's been lying to us, lying to us.


Don't like the way that she's been going 'bout it, going 'bout it.
Kells what you think that we should do about it, do about it?


Call her up at her home.
She won't know that I'm on the phone.

Yeah man that's the way.

Homie we about to bust this trick.
Man just ask her to meet up with you
And I'm going to show up too

And she won't know what to do.

We'll be standing there singing.

The same girl, same girl.
She was the apple of my eye
And your potential wife.
The same girl, the same girl.
I just can't believe we've been messing with the same girl.
The same girl, the same girl.
She gon' be looking so stupid when she see us together
U, K man we been messing with the same girl.

See, she was taking flights, going back and forth
I would pick her up, ay, at the airport
Man, I really can't believe
I can't believe it no
The same girl, same girl
