Hey fellas look over there
See that woman over there
With her long pretty hair
Don't she look good (yeah)
Don't she look good (yeah)

And see that woman that just drove right in
With her hair blowing in the wind
Didn't she look good (yeah)
Didn't she look good (yeah)

See that woman going to church
All dressed up in her mini skirt, woo!
She looks good (yeah)
Don't she look good (yeah)

And see that woman eating her lunch
She's got skin you'd love to touch
Don't she look good (yeah)
Don't she look good (yeah)

Listen, you better keep the woman you got
I know the other one looks good to ya
But she might not be as good as she looks
Ain't it the truth, brother (yeah)
It's the truth

Girls listen, let me show you something
See that man dressed in his Nehru
He's got pockets of money to give you
Don't he look good (yeah)
Don't he look good (yeah)

And see that man across the street
With those alligator shoes on his feet
Oh the man's looking good (yeah)
He looks good (yeah)

And see that man over to your right
He throws big parties every night
The man is good (yeah)
Don't he look good (yeah)

And check that man over to your left
Huh, all the women say he's kinda stuck on hisself
Oh the man knows he's lookin' good (yeah)
He's lookin' good (yeah)

But you better keep the same man you got
I know the other one looks good to ya
But he might not be as good as he looks
Ain't it the truth, girl (yeah)
It's the truth
