Let me tell you about a place, somewhere up in New York way
where the people are so gay, twistin' the night away
Here they have a lot of fun, puttin' trouble on the run
Oh man you'll find the old and young twistin' the night away

Here's a man in evening clothes, how he got here I don't know
but oh man, you ought to see him go, twistin' the night away
He's dancing with a chick in slacks, she's moving up and back
Oh man, there ain't nothing like twistin' the night away

Feel much better

Here's a fellow in blue jeans, who's dancing with an older queen
dolled up in her diamond rings, twistin' the night away
Man you ought to see her go, twistin' to the rock and roll
Here you'll find the young and the old twistin' the night away

They're twistin', twistin', everybody's doing great
They're twistin' man, twistin', they're twistin' the night away
Twistin', you know they're twistin', twistin' the night away
They're twistin', twistin', man twistin' the night away

Here they have a lot of fun, puttin' trouble on the run
Oh man you'll find young and the old twistin' the night away
Here's a man in evening clothes, how he got here I don't know
I don't know but man you ought to see him go
Twistin' the night away
