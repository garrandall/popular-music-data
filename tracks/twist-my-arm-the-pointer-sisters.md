Oooo-ooo- twist my arm
Oooo-ooo- twist my arm
I'll give you something
Don't you want it that bad
Do you want it
I can give it
'Cause I've got it
You just twist it

If you wanna hold it
If you wanna show it
Come and let me know it
Just twist my arm
I'll be here to please it
Always here to feed it
Love you like you need
Just twist my arm

Oooo-ooo- twist my arm
Oooo-ooo- twist my arm

I've got a sweet tooth
I like sweet things
Nothing turns me loose
Like the sugar you bring
Do you want it
Can you use it
I can fix it
You just twist it

Don't save it for someone else
Don't slip it to me on the sly
Just tell me what you want
Don't have to tell me why
