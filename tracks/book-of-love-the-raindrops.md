Book Of Love

-Artists: The Monotones
-Peak Billboard position # 5 in 1958
-Reportedly inspired by a Pepsodent commercial "You'll wonder where the yellow
-Went when you brush your teeth with Pepsodent."

I wonder, wonder who, who-oo-ooh WHO 
(Who wrote the Book Of Love?)

Tell me, tell me, tell me
Oh, who wrote the Book Of Love?
I've got to know the answer
Was it someone from above?

(Oh, I wonder, wonder who, mmbadoo-ooh, WHO) 
(Who wrote the Book Of Love?)

I love you darlin'
Baby, you know I do
But I've got to see this Book of Love
Find out why it's true

(Oh, I wonder, wonder who, mmbadoo-ooh, WHO) 
(Who wrote the Book Of Love?)

(Chapter One says to love her)
(You love her with all your heart)
(Chapter Two you tell her you're never, never, never, never, never gonna part)
(In Chapter Three remember the meaning of romance)
(In Chapter Four you break up but you give her just one more chance))

(Oh, I wonder, wonder who, mmbadoo-ooh, WHO) 
(Who wrote the Book Of Love?)

Baby, baby, baby
I love you, yes I do
Well it says so in this Book Of Love
Ours is the one that's true

(Oh, I wonder, wonder who, mmbadoo-ooh, WHO) 
(Who wrote the Book Of Love?)

(Chapter One says to love her)
(You love her with all your heart)
(Chapter Two you tell her you're never, never, never, never, never gonna part)
(In Chapter Three remember the meaning of romance)
(In Chapter Four you break up but you give her just one more chance)

(Oh, I wonder, wonder who, mmbadoo-ooh, WHO) 
(Who wrote the Book Of Love?)

Baby, baby, baby
I love you, yes I do
Well it says so in this Book Of Love
Ours is the one that's true

(Oh, I wonder, wonder who, mmbadoo-ooh, WHO) 
(Who wrote the Book Of Love?)

I wonder who (YEAH)
Who wrote the Book Of Love?
