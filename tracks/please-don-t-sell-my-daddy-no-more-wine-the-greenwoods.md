(Chorus)
Please don't sell my daddy no more wine, no more wine
Mama don't want him drinking all the time
Please don't sell my daddy no more wine, no more wine
He may be no good, but he's still mine

Late one night in old Joe's friendly barroom
Two men were standing drinking all alone
Thinking of the days when they were younger
Talking 'bout the women they had known
When there in the dim light of the tavern
A sweet young girl came softly to their side
And to one man's surprise he looked upon two tear stained eyes
And saw his own sweet daughter there who cried


My daddy used to buy me pretty dresses
Now it's only hand-me-downs and worn out shoes
It's because of you I know that I wear these ragged clothes
For you're the man who sells my daddy booze
Her father looked down on the glass that he was holding
As the teardrop trickled down his solemn face
I been here Joe so long, now it's time that I was gone
Going home to stay, I'll never see this place


Don't you do it, don't you do it
Don't you sell my daddy no more wine, no more wine
He may be no good, but he's still mine
