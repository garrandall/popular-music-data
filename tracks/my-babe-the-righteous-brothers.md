I'm talkin' 'bout my baby, not your baby
She's my babe, she's so fine
I'm talkin' 'bout my baby, not your baby
She's my babe, she's so fine
She's right there to love me
Well people come, rain or shine, shine


Now I love her, don't you love her
'Cause I love her, you hear?
I said I love her, don't you love her
'Cause I love her, you hear?
She upsets my soul when she whispers sweet things in my ear


I love the way she walks, I love the way she talks
She makes me feel so good, just like a young man should
She never makes me cry, and here's why
She's my babe, she's my babe


Nothin' could be better than to see her in a sweater
And a real tight skirt that won't quit
Nothin' could be better than to see her in a sweater
And a tight skirt, that won't quit
I'm warm for her form, but people, let me tell you that's it
Oh yeah! (That's it)




Oh, oh, oh, oh, my babe
Ah-huh-huh-huh, my babe
My, my, my, my, my babe
Ah-huh-huh-huh, my babe
My, my, my, my, my babe
She's my babe, she's my babe
Oh yeah!
She's my babe, she's my babe
She's my babe
She's my babe, she's my babe
She's my babe
She's my babe, she's my babe
She's my babe
Oh yeah!
She's my babe, she's my babe
She's my babe
