Now, don't just walk away
Pretending everything's okay and you don't care about me.
And I know it's just no use.
When all your lies become your truths and I don't care.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Could you look me in the eye,
And tell me that you're happy now.
Oooh.
Would you tell it to my face or have I been erased,
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

Do you really have everything you want.
You could never give something you ain't got,
You can't run away from yourself.

Could you look me in the eye,
And tell me that you're happy now.
Yeah, yeah.

Come on tell it to my face or have I been replaced,
Are you happy now?
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

Are You Happy Now?
