Boom clap
Boom de clap de clap
Boom-boom clap
Boom de clap de clap
Boom-boom clap
Boom de clap de clap
Boom-boom clap
Boom de clap de clap

Try it with me, here we go.
Boom-boom clap
Boom de clap de clap
That's right
Boom de clap de clap
Boom-boom clap
Boom de clap de clap

1-2-3 everybody come on off your seats, 
I'm gonna tell you bout a beat, 
That's gonna make you move your feet.

I'll give the barbecue, 
Show and tell you how to move, 
If you're 5 or 82, 
This is something you can do.

Pop it, lock it, polka-dot it
Countrify it then hip-hop it.
Put your hawk in the sky, 
And move side-to-side.
Jump to the left, stick it, glide.

Zig-zag, across the floor
Shuffle in diagonal, 
When the drum hits, hands on your hips.
One-footed 180 twist.
Then a zig-zag, step slide
Lean it left, clap 3 times
Shake it out, head to toe
Throw it all together, that's how we roll.

Do the hoedown (throwdown) 

Throw it all together, that's how we roll.

We get to 4, 5, 6
And you're feeling busted, 
But it's not time to quit, 
Practice makes you perfect.

Pop it, lock it, polka-dot it
Countrify it then hip-hop it.
Put your hawk in the sky, 
And move it side-to-side.
Jump to the left, stick it, glide.

Zig-zag, cross the floor
Shuffle in diagonal, 
When the drum hits, 
Hands on your hips.
One-footed 180 twist.
Then a zig-zag, step slide
Lean it left, clap 3 times
Shake it out, head to toe
Throw it all together, that's how we roll.

Do the hoedown (throwdown) 

Throw it all together, that's how we roll.

Boom de clap de clap, 
Boom-boom clap.
Come on, here we go.
Boom-Boom clap, 
Boom de clap de clap.
Boom-Boom clap, 
Boom de clap.

Pop it, lock it, polka-dot it
Countrify it then hip-hop it.
Put your hawk in the sky, 
And move it side-to-side.
Jump to the left, stick it, glide.

Zig-zag, across the floor
Shuffle in diagonal, 
When the drum hits, hands on your hips.
One-footed 180 twist.

Then a zig-zag, step slide
Lean it left, clap 3 times
Shake it out, head to toe
Throw it all together, that's how we roll.

Do the hoedown (throwdown) 

Throw it all together, that's how we roll.

Do the hoedown (throwdown) 

Throw it all together, that's how we roll.

Boom dap clap, ba-boom dap clap, clap, clap
Boom dap clap, ba-boom da clap, clap, clap
Boom da clap, boom de clap de clap
Throw it all together, that's how we roll.
