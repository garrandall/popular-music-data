as I look into your eyes
i see all the reasons why
my life's worth a thousand skies
you're the simplest love I've known
and the purest one i'll own
know you'll never be alone

my baby you
are the reason I could fly
and 'cause of you
i don't have to wonder why
baby you
there's no more just getting by
you're the reason I feel so alive
though these words I say are true
they still fail to capture you
as mere words can only do
how do I explain that smile
and how it turns my world around
keeping my feet on the ground

i will soothe you if you fall
i'll be right there if you call
you're my greatest love of all

arianna I feel so alive
