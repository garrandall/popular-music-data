as i look into your eyes 
i see all the reasons why 
my life's worth a thousand skies 
you're the simplest love i've known 
and the purest one i'll own 
know you'll never be alone 
 
my baby you 
are the reason i could fly 
and 'cause of you 
i don't have to wonder why 
baby you 
there's no more just getting by 
you're the reason i feel so alive 
though these words i say are true 
they still fail to capture you 
as mere words can only do 
how do i explain that smile 
and how it turns my world around 
keeping my feet on the ground 

i will soothe you if you fall 
i'll be right there if you call 
you're my greatest love of all 

arianna i feel so alive
