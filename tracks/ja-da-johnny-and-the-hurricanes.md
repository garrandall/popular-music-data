You've heard all about your raggy melody
Everything from opera down to harmony
But I've a little song that I will sing to you
It's gonna win you through and through

There ain't much to the words but the music is grand
And you'll be a-singing it to beat the band
You've heard of the tisket and tasket, it's true
But give a little listen to this, will you?

Ja-da, ja-da, ja-da, ja-da, jing, jing, jing
Ja-da, ja-da, ja-da, ja-da, jing, jing, jing
That's a funny little bit of melody
It's so soothing and appealing to me
It goes ja-da, ja-da, ja-da, ja-da, jing, jing, jing

Our bands have been digging back for tunes to be sung
Operas and nursery rhymes have been overdone
I dug a little deeper and I found this thing
It's ragtime but it still can swing

It ain't a turkey trot or a shimmy one step
But when grandma danced to it, she thought she was hep
It still is a ditty, I'm sure you will find
Will keep a-runnin' 'round and 'round your mind

Ja-da, ja-da, ja-da, ja-da, jing, jing, jing
Ja-da, ja-da, ja-da, ja-da, jing, jing, jing
That's a funny little bit of melody
It's so soothing and appealing to me
It goes ja-da, ja-da, ja-da, ja-da, jing, jing, jing
