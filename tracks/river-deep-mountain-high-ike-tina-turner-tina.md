When I was a little girl, I had a rag doll
Only doll I've ever owned
Now I love you just the way I loved that rag doll
But only now my love has grown

And it gets stronger in every way
And it gets deeper, let me say
And it gets higher day by day

And do I love you, my oh my
Yeah, river deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lost you, would I cry
Oh, how I love you, baby, baby, baby, baby

When you were a young boy, did you have a puppy
That always followed you around?
Well, I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy
No, I'll never let you down

It goes on and on like a river flows
And it gets sweeter, baby, and heaven knows
And it gets sweeter, baby, as it grows

And do I love you, my oh my
Yeah, river deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lost you, would I cry
Oh, how I love you, baby, baby, baby, baby

I love you, baby, like a flower loves the spring
And I love you, baby, like a robin loves to sing
And I love you, baby, like a schoolboy loves his pet
And I love you, baby, river deep, mountain high

Baby, baby, baby, yow

Do I love you, my oh my
Yeah, river deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lost you, would I cry
Oh, how I love you, baby, baby, baby, baby
