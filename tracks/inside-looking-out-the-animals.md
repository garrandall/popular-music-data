Sittin' here lonely like a broken man
Sell my time and doin' the best I can
I wasn't boss they surrounding me
I don't want your sympathy, yeah

Oh baby, oh baby, I just need your tender lovin'
To keep me sane in this burnin' oven
When my time is up, be my reaper
Like Adam's work on God's green earth
My reaper, my reaper baby, Yeah I mean it's my reaper, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Baby baby baby c'mon c'mon c'mon, yeah, yeah

Ice cold water's runnin' in my brain
And they drag me back to work again
Pains and blisters on my mind and my hands
From living daily with those canvas bags
Thoughts of freedom they're drivin' me wild
And I'll by happy like a new born child

We'll be together, girl, you wait and see
No more walls to keep your love from me
Yeah, can't you feel my love
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Need you, squeeze you,
Noooo-body but, nobody but, you girl, I love you, need you
Alight, I said everything's gonna be alright
And if you don't believe what I say
Just listen baby and I'll tell you

Can't you feel my love
Can't you see my skill
Can't you yell my love
It's getting louder
It's getting louder
A little closer, yeah

I said baby, baby I need you, c'mon, squeeze, please
Lord, I love you, I need you, yeah
Yeah, right by my side
I need you here by my side
But I can't help it baby
But, I'll be home soon
I'll be home soon, yeah
All right, whoa
