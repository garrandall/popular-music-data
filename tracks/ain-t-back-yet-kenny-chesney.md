I heard a song about a rambling man
Bought a guitar and I started a band
I got a gig at the local Am Vet
I was gone and I am not back yet

69 bored, out and jacked up
A quarter mile that was all it was
I burned the cool off of that Corvette
And I was gone and I am not back yet


Looking back at the moments, black and white
I wouldn't change a thing that changed my life
For the worse, for the better
Man, I was gone, gone forever


She was a cut offs pepper sauce queen
Man, we were matches and gasoline
First taste of love never will forget
I was gone and I am not back yet
I was gone, gone and I am not back yet


Looking back at the moments, black white
I wouldn't change a thing that changed my life
For the worse, for the better
Man, I was gone, gone forever
The laughs, the smiles, the trials, the tears
It's hard to hate what got me here
What got me here


She was a straight out of Hollywood smile
We missed it all by a country mile
Went out one night for some cigarettes
And I was gone and I am not back yet


I was gone, gone and I am not back yet
I was gone and I am not back
I am not back, am not back yet
