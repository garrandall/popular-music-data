A long and lasting love
Not many people find it
But those who do
Their whole life through
Put their hearts and souls behind it
A long and lasting love

A long and lasting love
It's what I've always dreamed of
And when I looked into your eyes
I knew I'd really seen love
A long and lasting love


We got a once in a lifetime
All the dreams we're waiting for
Are just beginning to come true

It happens once in a lifetime
When you find the special girl
Who knows the meaning of love like you


A long and lasting love
We share for many reasons
A special bond that goes beyond
The changing of the seasons
A long and lasting love

When a love like ours appears
It cherishes it
Through all the years
A long and lasting love



A long and lasting love
It's what I've always dreamed of
And when I looked into your eyes
I knew I'd really seen love
A long and lasting love
It's what I've always dreamed of
My long and lasting love
