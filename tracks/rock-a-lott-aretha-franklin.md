Rock, rock, rock...

It's time to jam, y'all
Freaks, get up against the wall
And let's rock, hey

Oh, oh, yeah

No longer will I do all
The things that I used to do
Stood by your side in innocence
For my love was just for you

Well, I'm a big girl now
With big needs and desires
So don't you come around
If you can't take me higher

I like to rock a lot
Throw my love away
On on only one boy
I like to rock a lot
That's how it is of lately
Hey, hey, yeah

I like to rock a lot
I'll take a path and stay
Yes, I will now
I like to rock a lot
Big boy, oh

Rock, rock, rock...
Oh, yeah, I like to party
Yeah, oh...

I think it's my turn this time
Not a soul gets by
Games never had no place with me
Jamming is my concern

Just give me one good man
To keep me satisfied
Have you gone underground
And if so, where will you hide
Sweet thing, hey

I like to rock a lot
Throw my love away
On on only one
I like to rock a lot
That's how it is of lately
Yeah, baby

I like to rock a lot
Take a path and stay. oh, baby
I like to rock a lot
Big boy, I am, oh

Rock, rock, rock...

It's time to rock with Rebe
Yes, it is
Rocking is my soul's desire
And I'm gonna set you on fire

Oh, oh, oh...

I like to rock a lot
Throw my love away, oh, baby
I like to rock a lot
That's how it is of lately
Oh, yes, it is now

I like to rock a lot
Take a path and stay, oh, yeah
I like to rock a lot
Big boy, yeah, oh, oh, yeah

Rock, rock, rock...

Step on the funk now
Well, well
Freeze the funk, y'all

I tried to warn you
I tried to warn you
Yeah, yeah...

Rock, rock, rock...

I like it, I like it
I like it, I like it...
