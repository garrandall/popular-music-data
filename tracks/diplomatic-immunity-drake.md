Uhh, the mighty Set
Santana, what's up?
It's more like a movement you need be in tuned with
Killa the Don, what's good?
{Heatmakerz, crack music}
(Diplomatic immunity... immunity... immunity...)
Uh huh, yeah we back
(Immunity... immunity...)
Huh, ya favorite neighborhood drug dealers, haha
(Diplomatic immunity) Jones!


Uhh, way before we was dropping knowledge on samples (listen)
We was, cutting raw when using bottles of samples (facts)
Few made it out, but I only recall a handful (couple)
Most got locked and turn to T-shirts and candles (fuck shit up)
In the, war zone where bodies pop up dead (Harlem!)
Big difference from the cops and the Feds (check that out)
A big difference from the  and drop head ('bout a hundred thou')
I told 'em use it as my casket if I drop dead (clean)
Money, Power & Respect is what The LOX said (Jada, what up?)
He showed a lot of lack of respect is what the cop said (fuck the cops)
Paparazzi flicks on the 6th page (click, click, click)
Grimy bunch with the.40's by the rib cage
In my 'jects we wanted to be this like Big Dave (R.I.P.)
I been buying Rollies since a kid's age (my 9th one)
4, 5, 6, hop in a 7 Series (bank style)
With drop top shit I can see heaven clearly (pray for me)
Tried to put 'em on the game, but they never hear me (stupid)
Maybe a text is the closest that you getting near me (woo!)
Shit, this life is so ferocious that it's getting scary (ARRGGHH!)
And it's hard to stay focused, my eyes is getting teary, uhh


Diplomatic immunity, immunity...
Immunity... immunity...
Immunity... diplomatic immunity


, what up nigga
Ayo Capo, what up man
This Wasted Talent shit, huh?
Shit almost got wasted
We save that shit though

Uhh, diplomatic immunity (yes!)
After I fuck, all these girls wanna score me
Come get in tuned with me
I'm shining like the sun, and girl you looking like the moon to me (Yes you are)
Your man a goonie, scared to be the room with me (that's a fact)
That's detrimental (sure is)
I don't deal with anything that's sentimental
Had cocaine in a rental (Avis)
Nothing sweet, but all my suites are presidential (yup)
Dead presidents, I'm done with residential (why's that?)
What I mean, man, I bought my own zip code (oh!)
Leave me alone, I go flipmode
Don't care if you black with a big nose
White with pink toes, just how the shit goes
The kid with the sick flow
Jewelry, got Bruce Leroy slash Slick Rick glow
Fuck is you negro... this shit is crazy


Diplomatic immunity, immunity...
Immunity... immunity...
Immunity... diplomatic immunity...

 Do you know what the fifth is?

"Yes, Father, I know what the fifth is. The fifth is I refuse to answer on the grounds that I'm not incriminated"
 The Fifth Commandment
 "Thou shall not kill"
 That's right. Now, I want you to tell me what happened
 "No, Father, I'm not telling nobody nothing"
 Don't be afraid, my son. Nobody's more powerful than God

"I don't know about, father. Your guy's bigger than my guy up there, but my guy is bigger than your guy down here"
