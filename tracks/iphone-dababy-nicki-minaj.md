I'm tryna stay up off my iPhone
Told my bitch I love you, that was just a typo
That bitch drive me crazy, she gone make me psycho
Everything I been through, it's something only I know
Ay, I'm tryna stay up off my iPhone
Told my bitch I love you, that was just a typo
That bitch drive me crazy, she gone make me psycho
Everything I been through, it's something only I know, ay

I'm a legend just like Michael
My bitch is ungrateful so I'm out with my side hoe
She gone treat me different, I should make her my hoe
She don't need no surgery, she don't got no lypo
But she got that ass though, told her how to throw it right
She treat me like a motorcycle, ride me like a motorbike, vroom

I just took off, check the speed
I just made 100K off a show
I just made 50K off of weed
You know I like to play with yo hoe
I choke her and pull out her weave
I told her, "Bae I gotta go"
She begging me stay over please
I gotta leave boo
I don't wanna mislead you
I just wanna please you
She looked and said, "Me too"
So I let her ride out
She like how we vibe out
But if you pick my phone up I'ma put you in time out
'Cause I'm

I'm tryna stay up off my iPhone
Told my bitch I love you, that was just a typo
That bitch drive me crazy, she gone make me psycho
Everything I been through, it's something only I know
Ay, I'm tryna stay up off my iPhone
Told my bitch I love you, that was just a typo
That bitch drive me crazy, she gone make me psycho
Everything I been through, it's something only I know

I'm 'bout to tell my dude I love him, then I'm gonna dump him
'Cause to be honest I put my side nigga above him
Tell him that I know that he creeping with that hoe
That's why I'm fucking that nigga that I be calling my bro
Middle finger, fuck a-you
Who the fuck is you?
This L is for you
I'ma take a W

Fuck on the dick then I fuck up a check
He say he want a kiss but I give him a peck
I said call me Aretha, I want my respect
When you niggas get stupid it's plenty on deck
Ain't about to be sitting home crying for you
Better get one and pick if you buy it in blue
All these niggas is lined up eyeing the coupe
Because taking your spot what they dying to do
Ayo open the door, give me my clothes
Throw me the keys 'cause I'm taking the Rolls
Get any closer we coming to blows
You get the picture, ain't talking a pose

I mean who doing it, doing it
Like we doing it, doing it
Why you ruin it, ruin it
Here we go
How you ain't know a queen from a rat
She saw that cheese now you 'bout to get trapped
How you ain't know a queen from a rat
I run and you gon' be doubling back

I'm tryna stay up off my iPhone
Told my bitch I love you, that was just a typo
That bitch drive me crazy, she gone make me psycho
Everything I been through, it's something only I know
Ay, I'm tryna stay up off my iPhone
Told my bitch I love you, that was just a typo
That bitch drive me crazy, she gone make me psycho
Everything I been through, it's something only I know

Ain't no typo, ain't no Michael
Ain't a psycho, fuck your iPhone
(Yeah)
Fuck your iPhone
