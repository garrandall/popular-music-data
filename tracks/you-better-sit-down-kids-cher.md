You better sit down, kids
I'm telling you why, kids
You might not understand, kids
Just give it a try, kids

Now how should I put this
I've got something to say
You mother is staying
But I'm going away

No, we're not mad, kids
And it's hard to say why
Your mother and I, kids
Don't see eye to eye

Say your prayers before you go to bed
Make sure you get yourself to school on time
I know you'll do the things your mother asks
She's gonna need you more to stay in line
Keep in mind your mother's gonna need
Your help a whole lot more than she ever did before
No more fighting over little things because
I won't be here to stop them anymore

I know you don't want this
Neither do we
But sometimes things happen
That we can't foresee

Now try to be calm, kids
And don't look so sad
Just 'cause I am leaving
I'll still be your dad

Just remember I love you
And though I'm not here
Just call if you need me
I'll always be near

Say your prayers before you go to bed
Make sure you get yourself to school on time
I know you'll do the things your mother asks
She's gonna need you more to stay in line
Keep in mind your mother's gonna need
Your help a whole lot more than she ever did before
No more fighting over little things cause
I won't be here to stop them anymore

Well, I have to go now
So kiss me goodbye
My eyes are just red, kids
I'm too big to cry

You better sit down, kids
I'm telling you why
You might not understand, kids
But give it a try

You better sit down, kids
I'm telling you why
You might not understand
