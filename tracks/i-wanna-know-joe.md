Alright, oh, oh, oh


It's amazing how you knock me off my feet, mmm
Every time you come around me I get weak, oh yeah
Nobody ever made me feel this way, oh
You kiss my lips and then you take my breath away
So, I wanna know

So I can be all that and more (I'd like to know, yeah)
I'd like to know what makes you cry (so)
So I can be the one who always makes you smile

And he never took the time to make it work, no
(You deserve more lovin', girl)

So I can be all that and more (I'd like to know)
I'd like to know what makes you cry (so)
So I can be the one who always makes you smile

Tell me what I gotta do to please you
Baby, anything you say I'll do
Cause I only wanna make you happy
From the bottom of my heart, it's true
Tell me what I gotta do to please you
Baby, anything you say I'll do
Cause I only wanna make you happy
From the bottom of my heart, it's true


I wish that I could take a journey through your mind, alright
And find emotions that you always try to hide babe, oh
I do believe that there's a love you wanna share, oh, oh
I'll take good care of you, lady, have no fear, oh
So I wanna know

So I can be all that and more (and I'd like to know)
I'd like to know what makes you cry (oh, yeah)
So I can be the one who always makes you smile

Cause I only wanna make you happy
From the bottom of my heart, it's true
Tell me what I gotta do to please you
Baby, anything you say I'll do
Cause I only wanna make you happy
From the bottom of my heart, it's true
