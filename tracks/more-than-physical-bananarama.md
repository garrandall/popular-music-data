Hey boy
Its a matter of fact
I got what you want so don't go back
So come and get it let's have some fun
I wanna show you you're the only one

He said 'You're too keen'
I said 'I know what you mean'
Deep down down inside
Its a matter of fact

Baby I'm waiting
Anticipating
This is more than physical
I can't disguise it
I'm so excited
Oh oh oh yeah

Hey boy
I've been watching you
Come on and show me what you can do
You've got what I want stop wasting time
You're sending shivers up and down my spine

He said 'Whatcha doing to me?'
I said 'You wait and see'
Deep down down inside
Its a matter of fact

Baby I'm waiting
Anticipating
This is more than physical
I can't disguise it
I'm so excited
Oh oh oh yeah

Baby I'm waiting
Anticipating
This is more than physical
I can't disguise it
I'm so excited
Oh oh oh yeah

This is more than physical

Deep down
Deep down
Deep down
Deep down

He said 'Whatcha doing to me?'
I said 'You wait and see'
Deep down down inside
Its a matter of fact

Baby I'm waiting
Anticipating
This is more than physical
I can't disguise it
I'm so excited
Oh oh oh yeah
