Some folks know about it, some don't
Some will learn to shout it, some won't
But sooner or later, baby, here's a ditty
Say you're gonna have to get right down
To the real nitty gritty

Let's get right down to the real nitty gritty
Now, one, two, nitty gritty
Now, yeah, mmm, nitty gritty, ooh wee
Right down to the real nitty gritty

Ooh, ooh, double beating, double beating
Right down to the nitty gritty
Yeah, double beating, I keep repeating
Right down to the nitty gritty, hey

Ooh, ooh, double beating, double beating
Right down to the nitty gritty
Yeah, double beating, keep repeating
Right down to the nitty gritty, yeah

Let's (let's) get (get) right (right)
On down (on down) to the real
(To the real) nitty gritty (nitty gritty)

One, two, nitty gritty now
Yeah, boom, nitty gritty, ooh wee
Right down to the real neal gritty

Get down, get on down, get down
(Right down to the real nitty gritty)
To the real nitty gritty
