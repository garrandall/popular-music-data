When I made my first million
I ain't panic
I only drank out this here
I'm done with Xannies
I bought my mom a crib
I'm on my standard
I'm pushing my cousin appeal
'Til it's granted
I bought her Sheneneh heels
I'm a Chanel bandit
I still got vintage garments
Old as my granny
Got my interior all mint
And outside candy
I put your bitch in Balmain
Because she pretty

Hey, hey, hey
Freaky, I'm fuckin' her face
Her ass do not come with a waist
I'm impatient, I don't wanna wait
I eat gold and I am what I ate
I'll kill a bad mood with a eight
Ain't no shame that I hang with some snakes

Hey, hey
Cashed out on a foreign today
I hop in that Rari' and race
I never get tired of the A
Climb up to the top like a gate
You lil niggas copy and paste
Got gold like a bottle of Ace
A coca-cola bottle, her shape

Hey
I had a ball today
She drinkin' Chardonnay
Went in court and they had to debate
Jewish lawyer that handled the case
The codeine got hell of a taste
'Bout to pounce in alla your states
Take that money, that's all I can say

When I made my first million
I ain't panic
I only drank out this here
I'm done with Xannies
I bought my mom a crib
I'm on my standard
I'm pushing my cousin appeal
'Til it's granted
I bought her Sheneneh heels
I'm a Chanel bandit
I still got vintage garments
Old as my granny
Got my interior all mint
And outside candy
I put your bitch in Balmain
Because she pretty

Hey, hey
I fuck her whenever I want
I get exactly whatever I want
Massive paws on that cat like a dog
Fly the jet in the sky like hawk (Like hawk)
I geek up and I get in the zone (Geek up)
I put out all the racks in a vault

Hey, hey
We rich and above the law
I made my brother a boss
She keep that dick in her jaw
Cubic Z's on the shit I bought
Cuban links on my wrist when I floss
Carats stuck in my teeth when I talk
You gon' notice the C's when I walk

Hey, it's a pent', this not a loft
We got the G's, that is knowledge, jerk-off
If I put on White, then it's gotta be Off
Don't say a word, or that body can't talk
Sexy bitch turnin' me on
She wanna know what the Cartier cost
Put a Rolex on her arm

When I made my first million
I ain't panic
I only drank out this here
I'm done with Xannies
I bought my mom a crib
I'm on my standard
I'm pushing my cousin appeal
'Til it's granted
I bought her Sheneneh heels
I'm a Chanel bandit
I still got vintage garments
Old as my granny
Got my interior all mint
And outside candy
I put your bitch in Balmain
Because she pretty
