You got me lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely again

Have you ever been lonely?
Have you ever been blue? Oh, so blue
Ever loved someone just as I love you?

Can't you see that I'm sorry
For mistakes I've made?
Can't you see that I've changed?
How I've changed, can't you see that I've paid?

Be a little forgiving
Take me back in your heart, in your heart
No use in living
Now that we're apart

If you knew what I've been through
You would know why I ask you
Have you ever been lonely?
Have you ever been blue?

Have you ever been a lonely, lonely one?
Have you ever been blue, blue, blue, blue, blue?
Ever loved someone just as I love you?

If you knew what I've been through
You would know why I ask you
Have you ever been lonely?
Have you ever been blue?

Have you ever been blue?
Have you ever been blue?
