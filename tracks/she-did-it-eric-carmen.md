I set to sea on a ship called Emptiness
Cast away on the Island of Loneliness
Looking for love
Oh, and I was looking for love

You know I, I didn't think she could hear my S.O.S.
But she appeared like an angel of tenderness
Sent from above
Oh, she was bringing me love

Oh, mama, she did it
Woh mama, she did it, yeah
Oh, she did it
Woh mama, she did it, yeah

Looking back, making love was meaningless
Till she touched me with her warmth and a gentleness
I'd never known
Oh, and she was guiding me home

Now I, now I see all the things in life I missed
Till she opened up my eyes to the limitless
Wonder of love
Oh, and now I'm ready for love

Oh, mama, she did it
Woh mama, she did it, yeah
Oh, she did it
Mama, she did it, yeah

I never knew what love was about
Till she came and stole away my heart
Now I'm alive and I know it
And all I ever want to do is show it
Oh, oh yeah

Oh, mama, she
Oh, mama, she
Oh, she did it
Woh mama, she did it, yeah
Oh, she did it
Woh mama, she did it, yeah

Oh, she did it
Woh mama, she did it, yeah
Oh, she did it
Woh mama, she did it, yeah
