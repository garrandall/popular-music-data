Saint Paul the persecutor
Was a cruel and sinful man
Jesus hit him with a blinding light
And then his life began
I said yes, I said yeah
Augustine knew temptation
He loved women, wine, and song
And all the special pleasures
Of doing something wrong
I said yes, I said yeah


I said yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
You'll never make a saint of me
Oh yeah, oh yeah
You'll never make a saint of me


And could you stand the torture?
And could you stand the pain?
Could you put your faith in Jesus
When you're burning in the flames?
I said yes, mmm
And I do believe in miracles
And I wanna save my soul
And I know that I'm a sinner
I'm going to die here in the cold
I said yes, I said yeah


I said yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
You'll never make a saint of me
Oh yeah, oh yeah
You'll never make a saint of me
Oh yeah, oh yeah
You'll never make a saint of me
Oh yeah, oh yeah
You'll never make a saint of me


I thought I heard a angel cry
I thought I saw a teardrop falling from his eye
Come on now


John the Baptist was a martyr
But he stirred up Herod's hate
And Salome got her wish
To have him served up on a plate
I said yes, yes, yeah


I said yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
You'll never make a saint of me
Oh yeah, oh yeah
You'll never make a saint of me
Oh yeah, oh yeah
You'll never make a saint of me
Oh yeah, oh yeah
You'll never make a saint of me


I thought I heard a angel cry
I thought I saw a teardrop falling from his eye
I thought I saw a angel cry


You'll never make a saint of me
You'll never make a saint of me
You'll never make a saint of me
Never make a saint of me
