I feel the night explode
When we're together
Emotion overload
In the heat of pleasure


Take me I'm yours into your arms
Never let me go
Tonight I really need to know


Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name


The passion's so complete
It's never ending
As long as I receive
This message you're sending


Body to body, soul to soul
Always feel you near
So say the words I long to hear


Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name


Love, love on the run
Breaking us down
Though we keep holding on
I don't want to lose
No, I can't let you go


Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name


Tell it to my heart
Tell me from the stars
Tell it to my heart
Tell it to my heart
Tell me from the stars
Tell it to my heart
Never make it stop
Oh take it to the heart
Oh no no ah ah


Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name


Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name
