Man I feel like money (man I feel like money)
They're attracted to me
They come around like honey (they come around like honey)
Cuz I'm fly like a bee
Man I got 'em all buzzin' buzzin' buzzin' buzzin'
Like da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Man I got the world buzzin' buzzin' buzzin' buzzin'
Like da-da-da-da-da-da-da


Uh, back up to back up in the mix like that
And I know ya like it when it's just like that
All the girlies just love my swag
From my kicks to the way I fix my hat
I'm...back
Fresh like some new J's
Brodie got next NBA 2K
I'm too paid
Shaded with some ladies
Reppin' my city
West LA baby!
West LA made me this way
Two rules :
Stay fresh , homie and get paid
Hey!
Never broke and never bummy
I'm from where it's forever sunny


Man I feel like money (man I feel like money)
They're attracted to me
They come around like honey (they come around like honey)
Cuz I'm fly like a bee
Man I got 'em all buzzin' buzzin' buzzin' buzzin'
Like da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Man I got the world buzzin' buzzin' buzzin' buzzin'
Like da-da-da-da-da-da-da


When I come around, 'round, 'round
They go
Yeah, yeah it's going down, down, down
They go


New cat with a old school feel
Only new artist with a old school deal
Taught to the game by Steve Lobell
So we always win, don't receive no L's
New girls act like they know me so well
But I shows no love and be like oh well
When my album drops , sure as hell gon' sell
Stack cash and laugh like L-O-L


Man I feel like money (man I feel like money)
They're attracted to me
They come around like honey (they come around like honey)
Cus I'm fly like a bee
Man I got 'em all buzzin' buzzin' buzzin' buzzin'
Like da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Man I got the world buzzin' buzzin' buzzin' buzzin'
Like da-da-da-da-da-da-da


When I come around , 'round , 'round
They go
Yeah , when I come around , 'round , 'round
They go
When I step in yo town , town , town
They go
Yeah , yeah it's going down , down , down
They go


Yee-uh Yee-uh
Shawty in my ear
Saying all the things that I wanna hear
Buzzin'!
And as the night ends
I'mma have her and get all her friends
Buzzin'!
Okay , hands in the air (Yee-uh)
From the back to the front
Everywhere
Buzzin'!
Throwin' out 20's
Throwin' out hundreds
Ladies gotta love it


Man I feel like money (man I feel like money)
They're attracted to me
They come around like honey (they come around like honey)
Cuz I'm fly like a bee
Man I got 'em all buzzin' buzzin' buzzin' buzzin'
Like da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Man I got the world buzzin' buzzin' buzzin' buzzin'
Like da-da-da-da-da-da-da


When I come around , 'round , 'round
They go
Yeah , yeah it's going down , down , down
They go
When I come around , 'round , 'round
They go
Yeah , yeah it's going down , down , down
They go
