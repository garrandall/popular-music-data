Oh, have mercy, baby

The latest talk
Is the funky funky walk
They doing that thing
Called the Broadway freeze

I want everybody
To keep on dancing now
Come on, y'all
Come on, y'all

Oh wee

Oh, have mercy

I want everybody to
Get they saddles on
Cause we gonna ride
The horse for a little while
If you ain't got no horse
Come on out here with your mule

And keep on dancing, baby
Oh, have mercy
Whip it now
Whip it, baby

Drummer, I want you to get real funky
Bass player, take it up a little bit
Now add a whole lotta soul
Come on, guitar player

I want everybody
To keep on dancing now
Whip it, oh, have mercy
Ohwee

Keep on dancing, baby...
