My heart belongs to you
So what could I do
To make you feel I'm down with
You see me hangin' around
But you don't know how you make me feel for you, and


(Each and every day) I try to make some sense of this
(What you mean to me) I know it could be serious
(Each and every night) I dream about just holding you
(Loving you like this) what is a girl supposed to do?


I love you (I love you)
I want you (I want you)
You're the one that I live for
And I can't take it anymore (anymore)
I love you (I love you)
I need you (and I need you)
What can I do to make you see
You're the only one for me


First time I saw your face
My heart just erased
All the guys I knew
Before you walked into my life
I was the type to never want for nothing


(Each and every day) I try to make some sense of this
(What you mean to me) I know it could be serious
(Each and every night) I dream about just holding you
(Loving you like this) What is a girl supposed to do?


I love you (I love you)
I want you (I need you)
You're the one that I live for
And I can't take it anymore
I love you (I love you)
I need you (need you)
What can I do to make you see
You're the only one for me


I love you, I want you, I need you in my life
Can't you see what you mean to me?
Baby, come hold me tight
I miss you, wanna kiss you
Every time I see your face
Baby, I'll be waiting for you
Each and every day


I love you (oh...)
I want you
You're the one that I live for
And I can't take it anymore
(Baby, you know that I love you)
I love you
I need you
What can I do to make you see
(do to make you see)
You're the only one for me (oh yeah)


You're the only one for me (only one)
And I know it's meant to be
(and I know we're meant to be)
What can I do to make you see
My love will carry on (listen to my heart)
So listen to my heart and know (and know)
You'll find out where my love will go (love will go)
The future lies between us both
Oh babe, I love you so


I love you
I want you
(and you know my heart belongs to you, boy)
You're the one that I live for
And I can't take it anymore
I love you (baby, I love you)
I need you (baby, I need you)
What can I do to make you see
You're the only one for me
I love you (you're the one for me)
I want you (it was meant to be)
You're the one that I live for
And I can't take it anymore
I love you
I need you
What can I do to make you see
You're the only one for me
I love you (baby, I love you)
I want you (baby, I need you)
