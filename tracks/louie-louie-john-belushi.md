Louie, Louie, oh, no
I said me gotta go
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I said Louie, Louie, oh, baby
Said me gotta go

A fine little girl
She waits for me
I'll catch a ship
Across the sea

I sail that ship all alone
Never think I'll make it home

Louie, Louie, oh, baby
I said me gotta go
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I said Louie, Louie, oh, honey
Said me gotta go

Three nights and days
I sail the sea
Me think of girl constantly
On that ship, I dream she's there
I smell the rose in her hair

Louie, Louie, oh, honey
I said me gotta go
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I said Louie, Louie, oh, baby
Said me gotta go

See Jamaica, the moon above
It won't be long, me see me love
Take her in my arms again
I; ll tell her that
I'll never leave again

Louie, Louie, oh, baby
I said me gotta go
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I said Louie, Louie, oh, honey
Said me gotta go

I said me gotta go now
I said me gotta go now
Right now
