I blame you for the moonlit sky and the dream that died with the eagles' flight
I blame you for the moonlit nights when I wonder why are the seas still dry?
don't blame this sleeping satellite

Did we fly to the moon too soon
did we squander the chance in the rush of the race
the reason we chase is lost in romance
and still we try to justify the waste for a taste of man's greatest adventure

I blame you for the moonlit sky and the dream that died with the eagles' flight
blame you for the moonlit nights when I wonder why are the seas still dry?
don't blame this sleeping satellite

have we lost what it takes to advance?
have we peaked too soon?
if the world is so green then why does it scream under a blue moon

we wonder why
If the earth's sacrificed for the price of it's greatest treasure

I blame you for the moonlit sky and the dream that died with the eagles' flight
don't blame this sleeping satellite
don't blame this sleeping satellite

and when we shoot for the stars what a giant step have we got
what it takes to carry the weight of this concept
or pass it by like a shot in the dark miss the mark with a sense of adventure

I blame you for the moonlit sky and the dream that died with the eagles' flight
blame you for the moonlit nights when I wonder why are the seas still dry?
don't blame this sleeping satellite
