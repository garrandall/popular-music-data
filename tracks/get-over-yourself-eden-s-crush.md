Uh-huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Get over, get over (listen)

Yeah, I was right there like a little wife
I was everything that you need, always in line
I was livin' you, lovin' you
Fillin' your desires
But that was then, this is now
Look me in the eye and

Oh, oh
If love could choose sides
Oh, oh
It's taking mine

 - Get over yourself, goodbye
It must be hard to be you, yeah, livin' in your life
I was always the one to cry
Now everything, everything, everything is alright
Get over yourself, know why
Cuz without you, see I do anything I like
Sometimes I stay out all night
And everything, everything, everything is alright

This just can't be it I kept telling myself
And every magazine said was me was on the shelf
I was givin' out, givin' in
Givin' away my dreams
You put it in, put me down
Now I got my self-esteem

Oh, oh
Won't get me back, no
Oh, oh (no no)
You think I overreact, yeah



So now you wanna talk
Say let's do it just once more for luck
Like old times make up
Better yet, just forget
Better get over yourself

Stay in touch
When you learn a few things about love (tell me baby)
Until then wake up
Better yet, better get
Better get over yourself

Get over yourself, goodbye (over yourself, goodbye)
Over yourself, over yourself
Get over yourself, goodbye (over yourself, goodbye)
Over yourself, over yourself

Get over yourself, goodbye
Cuz without you, see I do anything I like
Sometimes I stay out all night
And everything, everything, everything is alright




Get over yourself, goodbye (everything is alright)
Everything is alright (get over yourself)
Get over yourself, goodbye (everything is alright)
Everything is alright (get over yourself)
Get over yourself, goodbye
