If your sweetheart sends a letter of goodbye
It's no secret, you'll feel better, if you cry
When wakened, from a bad dream, don't you sometimes think it's real?
Well, it's only false emotion, that you feel

If your heartaches seems to hang around too long
And your blues keep getting blue-er with each song
Remember, sunshine can be found, behind a cloudy sky
So let your hair down now, and baby go on and cry

(If your heartaches seem to hang around too long)
(And your blues keep getting blue-er with each song) oh yeah
Well remember, sunshine can be found, behind a cloudy sky
Why don't you let your hair down now, baby go on and cry

I said let your hair down, baby go on and cry (go on baby and cry)
