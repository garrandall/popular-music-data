Shimmy shimmy, to and fro
Shimmy shimmy, to and fro
Shimmy shimmy, to and fro
Shimmy shimmy, to and fro
Shimmy shimmy, shimmy shimmy
Shimmy shimmy, to and fro
I do the shimmy
When I walk down the street
Cause that good music
Gives me the creeps
I do the shimmy
Even when I walk
My baby does the shimmy
When she talks that talk
Shimmy shimmy
Ah, oh, wa, wee
You can do the shimmy
By watching me
The shimmy shimmy
Is the dance of today
The shimmy shimmy
Is here to stay
The shimmy shimmy's
For old folks too
You go backwards and forwards
Then you're in the groove
Shimmy shimmy
Oh, my soul
The shimmy shimmy
Will never grow old
I did the shimmy
With Betty Lou
She sure can shimmy
With her brand new shoes
I did the shimmy out on a date
My girl looked at me and said
You're staying in taste
Shimmy shimmy
Ah, oh, wa, wee
The shimmy'll go down
In history, hey
The shimmy shimmy
Is the dance of today
The shimmy shimmy
Is here to stay
The shimmy shimmy's
For old folks too
You go backwards and forwards
Then you're in the groove
Shimmy shimmy
Oh, my soul
The shimmy shimmy
Will never grow old
I did the shimmy
With Betty Lou
She sure can shimmy
With her brand new shoes
The shimmy shimmy out on a date
They look at you and say
You're staying in taste
A shimmy shimmy
Ah, oh, wa, wee
The shimmy'll go down
In history
Shimmy shimmy, to and fro (oh, yeah)
Shimmy shimmy, to and fro (hey now)
Shimmy shimmy, to and fro (oh, yeah)
Shimmy shimmy, to and fro
Shimmy shimmy (shimmy shimmy)
Shimmy shimmy (shimmy shimmy)
Oh, yeah (shimmy shimmy, to and fro)
Shimmy shimmy
(Shimmy shimmy, to and fro)
Shimmy shimmy
(Shimmy shimmy, to and fro)
Shimmy shimmy
(Shimmy shimmy, to and fro)
Shimmy shimmy
(Shimmy shimmy, to and fro)
Shimmy shimmy (shimmy shimmy)
Shimmy shimmy (shimmy shimmy)
Shimmy shimmy (shimmy shimmy, to and fro)
Come on, baby
(Shimmy shimmy, to and fro)
Come on, baby
(Shimmy shimmy, to and fro)
Come on, baby
(Shimmy shimmy, to and fro)
Come on, baby
(Shimmy shimmy, to and fro)
Yeah, shimmy shimmy (shimmy shimmy)
Shimmy shimmy (shimmy shimmy)
Shimmy shimmy (shimmy shimmy, to and fro)
