Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too

Imagine all the people
Living life in peace (you)
You may say I'm a dreamer

But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you will join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man

Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world (you)

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you will join us
And the world will live as one
