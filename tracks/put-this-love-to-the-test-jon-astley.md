I wish I could learn
How to read your mind
Even though we've known
Each other for some time

I've got something to say
I hope I never regret
Let's take off our clothes
And put this love to the test

But there is a danger
There is no doubt
But making love
Is what life is about

Be my partner
Be my guest
Let's take off our clothes
And put this love to the test

You can be cruel
But can you be kind?
I don't suppose we could
Take off our clothes
And have a good time
Your place or mine

If I'm jumping the gun
Ignore my remark
I'm merely shooting
Arrows in the dark

For a heart to heart
Right here in the flesh
Let's take off our clothes
And put this love to the test

And as sure as the sun
Goes down in the west
We should take off our clothes
And put this love to the test

Let's take off our clothes
And put this love to the test
Let's take off our clothes
And put this love to the test

Let's take off our clothes
And put this love to the test
