Dear Mr. DJ, play it again
Dear Mr. DJ, play it again

Dear Mr. DJ, play it, play it again
I want my baby to remember when
We danced to the juke box
While the lights were low
'Til they played goodnight sweetheart
Well it's time to go

Dear Mr. DJ, he's gone, gone away
I want him to hear
The songs of yesterday
Oh make him remember
How he loved me then

Oh please Mr. DJ, play it again

A thousand stars in the sky
Were shining up above
I'll never forget
The night that we met
And we stood there pledging our love

I feel so lonely
Lonely, lonely and blue
Oh Mr. DJ, it's all up to you

Play all the goldies
From the old times then
Oh please Mr. DJ, play it again

We go together
(Play it again)
Sincerely
(Play it again)
You're a thousand miles away
(Play it again)
Earth angel, earth angel
(Play it again)
Life is but a dream
(Play it again)
He's gone
(Play it again)
