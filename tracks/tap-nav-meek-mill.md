(I'm in London, got my beat from London!)

Yeah, yeah
In the trap hanging places
That you can't go (Can't go)
Glock .40, he got smoked
He had a Draco (Had a Draco)
Thousand nights on that corner
Eating eggrolls (Eggrolls)
Bad bitch, Puerto Rican
Look like JLo (Jlo)
Whoa, they tried to extort me
I ain't pay though! (I ain't pay though)
Only thing I gave 'em was a halo
Aye ho, Uber on the way-o
Fuck her from the back
Put my thumb all in her A-hole! (In her A-hole)
I got bands, for real
Diamonds on me they dance, for real
All these sticks and drums
Banging like we in a band, for real
I got cake, I stay humble
Know I'm the man, for real
I got hittas, we don't rumble
Tell your mans to chill
Yo, who mans is this?
(Somebody come get this n***a)
All up in my session 'Intstagraming' shit
I be with some real hittas
They ain't with that camera shit
'Cause they really outchere in the field
And they be slamming shit

Tap, tap
Tap, tap, tap, tap
Giving head taps
Lead tap, tap, taps
They said that they were with it
But it's cap, cap, cap (Cap!)
Aiming at your fitted
Push it back, back, back (Back)
Whack, whack
Whack, whack, whack (Whack!)
One phone call
Get you whack, whack, whacked (Brr!)
Try to sleight me, we gon' let it
Slap, slap, slap (Slap, slap)
Cross the line, it's too late you can't take it
Back, back, back (Yeah)

They got my brother locked inside a cage (In a cage)
Take them shackles off his feet
He ain't a slave (Ain't a slave)
Growing up in the hood
You learn how to behave (Aye)
How we gon' learn to stack
If we ain't got nothing to save? (Save)
Got a new bad bitch
Got some work done on her butt (On her butt!)
Gotta catch another flight
As soon as I catch my nut (Catch my nut!)
Just being honest
Meek was the first to show me love (Show me love)
And the first time that I seen a Maybach
Was with Cuz (Cuz)
Getting these 'Bachs remodeled
I tell a opp it's up (It's up)
Got wedding bands
But I still don't got a bitch to cuff
In every city I go
They already know what's up (What's up)
I got these Royce's
I could get straight to the plug

Tap, tap
Tap, tap, tap, tap
Giving head taps
Lead tap, tap, taps

They said that they were with it
But it's cap, cap, cap (Cap!)
Aiming at your fitted
Push it back, back, back (Back)
Whack, whack
Whack, whack, whack (Whack!)
One phone call
Get you whack, whack, whacked (Brr!)
Try to sleight me, we gon' let it
Slap, slap, slap (Slap, slap)
Cross the line, it's too late you can't take it
Back, back, back (Yeah)
