We were very happy
Well at least I thought we were
Can't somebody tell me
What's got into her
A house, a home, a family
And a man who loves her so
Who'd believe she'd leave us
To join a burlesque show?

Say has anybody seen my
Sweet Gypsy Rose?
Here's her picture when she was my
Sweet Mary Jo
Now she's got rings on her fingers
And bells on her toes
Say has anybody seen my
Sweet gypsy Rose?

Oh, I know when Mary Jo's been dancin'
Here in New Orleans
In this smoke-filled honky-tonk
They call the land of dreams
Whoa, here she comes a-struttin'
In her birthday clothes
Say has anybody seen my
Sweet gypsy Rose?

Whoa, baby, baby,
Won'tcha come home
Say, we all miss ya
And every night we kiss your picture

Whoiah Rose, one night the lights go dim,
And the crowd goes home
That's the day you wake up
And you find you're all alone
So let's say goodbye to Gypsy
Hello Mary Jo
Say has anybody seen my
Sweet Gypsy Rose

So take those rings off your fingers
And bells off your toes
Say has anybody seen my
Now you know just what I mean by
Has anybody seen my Sweet Gypsy Rose
