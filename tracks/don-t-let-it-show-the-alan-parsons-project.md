If it's getting harder to face every day
Don't let it show, don't let it show
Though it's getting harder to take what they say
Just let it go, just let it go

And if it hurts when they mention my name
Say you don't know me
And if it helps when they say I'm to blame
Say you don't own me

Even if it's taking the easy way out
Keep it inside of you
Don't give in
Don't tell them anything
Don't let it
Don't let it show

Even though you know it's the wrong thing to say
Say you don't care, say you don't care
Even if you want to believe there's a way
I won't be there, I won't be there

But if you smile when they mention my name
They'll never know you
And if you laugh when they say I'm to blame
They'll never own you

Even if you feel you've got nothing to hide
Keep it inside of you
Don't give in
Don't tell them anything
Don't let it
Don't let it show
