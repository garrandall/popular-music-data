We were playin' in a club uptown
We were tryin' to get up, they kept pullin' us down
They said, "We love your sound
But we ain't found nothin' we can dance to"

So play us another one
Like the other one
Like the one on the radio
Don't go slow
Get on with the show

If you can't dance to this one
You just can't dance at all
If you can't dance to this one
You just can't dance, you can't dance
If you can't dance 'cause you don't know how
Find someone gonna you how
If you can't dance to this one
You just can't dance, you can't dance

Listen to the song
You can move your feet
If you listen to your heartbeat
Close your mind, let your body go

Here comes another one
Like the other one
Like the one on the radio
Here we go
It's one in a row

If you can't dance to this one
You just can't dance at all
If you can't dance to this one
You just can't dance, you can't dance
If you can't dance 'cause you don't know how
Find someone gonna you how
If you can't dance to this one
You just can't dance, you can't dance
