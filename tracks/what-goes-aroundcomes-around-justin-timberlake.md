Hey, girl
Is he everything you wanted in a man?
You know I gave you the world
You had me in the palm of your hand
So why your love went away
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you, baby
Me and you until the end, but I guess I was wrong, uh


Don't wanna think about it (Uh)
Don't wanna talk about it (Uh)
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's endin' this way
Just so confused about it (Uh)
Feelin' the blues about it (Yeah)
I just can't do without ya
Tell me, is this fair?


Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breakin' my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're livin' a lie
But that's okay, baby, 'cause in time, you will find


What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
Yeah


Now, girl
I remember everything that you claimed
You said that you were movin' on now (On now)
And maybe I should do the same (Maybe I should do the same)
The funny thing about that is
I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you, baby
And now it's all just a shame and I guess I was wrong, uh


Don't wanna think about it (No)
Don't wanna talk about it (Hmm)
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's endin' this way
Just so confused about it (Uh)
Feelin' the blues about it (Yeah)
I just can't do without ya
Can you tell me, is this fair?


Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye? (Uh)
Should've known better when you came around
Should've known better that you were gonna make me cry
Now it's breakin' my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're livin' a lie
That's okay, baby, 'cause in time, you will find


What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
Yeah


What goes around comes around
Yeah
What goes around comes around
You should know that
What goes around comes around
Yeah
What goes around comes around
You should know that (Yeah)


Don't wanna think about it (No)
Don't wanna talk about it (Hmm)
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's endin' this way
Just so confused about it (Uh)
Feelin' the blues about it (Yeah)
I just can't do without ya
Tell me, is this fair?


Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye? (Oh)
Should've known better when you came around
Should've known better that you were gonna make me cry
It's breakin' my heart to watch you run around
(Now it's breakin' my heart)
'Cause I know that you're livin' a lie
But that's okay, baby, 'cause in time, you will find


What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around, yeah




Yep, yep, yep, yep
Let me paint this picture for you, baby


You spend your nights alone and he never comes home
And every time you call him, all you get's a busy tone
I heard you found out that he's doin' to you
What you did to me, ain't that the way it goes?
When you cheated, girl, my heart bleeded, girl
So it goes without sayin' that you left me feelin' hurt
Just a classic case, a scenario
Tale as old as time, girl, you got what you deserved


And now you want somebody (Hey)
To cure the lonely nights (Hey)
You wish you had somebody (Hey)
That could come and make it right (Hey)
But girl, I ain't somebody (Hey)
With a lot of sympathy (Hey)
You'll see, see


(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(Take it to 'em, hey)


(Take it to 'em)
See, you should've listened to me, baby
(Take it to 'em)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
(Take it to 'em)
Because (What goes around comes back around)
Hahaha
