I've been down one time
And I've been down two times
But right now I'm drowning
Drowning in a sea of love

I've been out here for so very long
I've lost all of my direction
Baby when you came my way
I thought I had found my protection
But a strong wind came into my life
It surely took me by surprise
I can't seem to control these tears
That are falling from my eyes

I've been down one time
And I've been down two times
But right now I'm drowning
Drowning in a sea of love

Baby I depended on you
For our love navigation
Now you've gone and deserted me
Can't you see that I'm in desperation
I'm in the middle of a bad love storm
Oh yeah I wasn't ready for
And I look around and all I see
Is water coming over me

I've been down one time
I've been down two times
But right now I'm drowning
Drowning in a sea of love

I've been out here for so very long
I lost all of my direction
Baby when you came my way
I thought I had found my protection
But a strong wind came into my life
It surely took me by surprise
And I can't seem to control these tears
That are falling from my eyes

I've been down one time
And I've been down two times
But right now I'm drowning
Drowning in a sea of love
Drowning in a sea of love
