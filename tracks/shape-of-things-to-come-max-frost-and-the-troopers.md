There's a new sun
Risin' up angry in the sky
And there's a new voice
Sayin': "we're not afraid to die!"
Let the old world make believe
It's blind and deaf and dumb, but

Nothing can change the shape of things to come

There are changes
Lyin' ahead in every road
And there are new thoughts
Ready and waiting to explode
When tomorrow is today
The bells may toll for some, but

Nothing can change the shape of things to come

The future's comin' in, now
Sweet and strong
Ain't no-one gonna hold it back for long
There are new dreams
Crowdin' out old realities
There's revolution
Sweepin' in like a fresh new breeze
Let the old world make believe
It's blind and deaf and dumb, but

Nothing can change the shape of things
Nothing can change the shape of things
Nothing can change the shape of things
Nothing can change the shape of things to come
