If I became President, I know I won't last a day
I would lower all the taxes just to suit your taste
I'd bring home all the fellers from over in Viet Nam
Station them around your door so the world can't do you no harm
I'd name every street in the city, Honey, after you (yeah yeah yeah)
In the fight against poverty, there's no limit to what I'd do

I could never be President
Just as long as I'm lovin' you
I could never be President
Just as long as I'm lovin' you, you
Yeah

Honey I would make you, the first lady of the land
Don't you know I'd place presidental powers in your hand
Congress would veto the first bill I would pass
First would be: tear the Whitehouse down, build you a house of glass
And stake out the Navy on every downtown street
So your little feet won't get so tired when you go on a shopping spree

I could never be President
Just as long as I'm lovin' you
I could never be President
Just as long as I'm lovin' you, you
Ouw! Ouwwww!
I could never be President
I could never be President

Honey to make sure, you never never have a care
I'd open up the door to Fort Knox, tell you to help yourself
And give you a nation, if that didn't seem to do
I'd send up a Gemini player to stake a claim on the moon for you

I could never be President
Just as long as I'm lovin' you
I could never be President
Just as long as I'm lovin' you
I'd give you a nation
If that didn't seem to do
I could never be your President
Just as long as I'm lovin' you
Wooooe baby
Just as long as I'm lovin' you
Ouwwwww
