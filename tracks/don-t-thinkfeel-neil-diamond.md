Hey
Sleepy old sun, sleepy old day
Sleepy old tree gonna make me some shade
Sleepy old time on my side of town
I'm feelin' fine, I'll explain to you now

Don't think, feel
Ain't no big deal
Just make it real and don't think, feel
It don't take plans to clap your hands
When it feels nice just don't think twice

Some worry all day 'bout who they can trust
Some worry all night 'bout money and lust
Worried they do and worried they die
And after they're gone just the bankers cry

Don't think, feel
Ain't no big deal
Just make it real and don't think, feel
It don't take plans to clap your hands
When it feels nice just don't think twice

Life is a card, you take what you get
You do what you can to feel no regret
You do what you can, forget about words
Just go with the feelin' it usually works

And don't think, feel
Ain't no big deal
Just make it real and don't think, feel
It don't take plans to clap your hands
When it feels nice you don't think twice

Don't think, feel
Ain't no big deal
Just make it real and don't think, feel
It don't take plans to clap your hands
When it feels nice you don't think twice

Don't think, feel
Ain't no big deal
Just make it real and don't think, feel
