It's hard for me to stop my heart
Love never knows when the time is right
I don't want to hurt anybody 
But can't help lovin' you

I never felt like this before
I know this is special worth waiting for
Let life takes it course
That's the only thing for us to do

We've got time and baby there's no rush
Gonna be a better day for us
Hang on and I will wait for you
Our love will always stay as good as new

Time and tide
Nothin' and no one can stop us now
For better, for worse
This time I'm sure
It's gonna last

How can is stop my heart
Love never knows when the time is right
I don't wanna hurt anybody
Don't want to make them cry

We've got time and baby there's no rush
Gonna be a better day for us
Hang on and I will wait for you
Our love will always stay as good as new

It's a matter of time, only a matter of time
Just a matter of time...

Time and tide
Nothin' and no one can stop us now
For better, for worse
This time I'm sure
It's gonna last
Gonna last forever!

We've got time and baby there's no rush
Gonna be a better day for us
Hang on and I will wait for you...
