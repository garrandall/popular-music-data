What if that road that you're taking's a dead end?
What if love leaves you all jaded and broken?
What if that limb breaks you're climbing out on?
Yeah, what if it all goes wrong?

But, what if it all goes right?
What if it all works out?
What if the stars line up and good luck rains down?
What if you chase your dreams and it changes your whole life?
Yeah, what if it all goes right?

What if that road is a beautiful slow drive?
What if that love ends up lasting a lifetime?
What if that limb holds you oak tree strong?
What if this time nothing goes wrong?

But, what if it all goes right?
What if it all works out?
What if the stars line up and good luck rains down?
What if you chase your dreams and it changes your whole life?
Yeah, what if it all goes right?

What if you climb to the mountain top and touch the sky?
Grab a cloud as it passes by?
You might fall you might fall
But then again you might fly

What if it all goes right?
What if it all works out?
What if the stars line up and good luck rains down?
What if you chase your dreams and it changes your whole life?
Yeah, what if it all goes right?
