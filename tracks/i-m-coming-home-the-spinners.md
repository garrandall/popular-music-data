Ha (Prod. Walkz)
You lot just heard what Shotty Shane was on
Lemme show you lot what Dappz is on
Bare badness
Bare violence
You know what I'm saying?

Two on ped, five in the dinger
One in the head, six in the spinner
Back in double tap days, I slapped that gauge 'til I broke that trigger
Back in double tap days, it was Dappz that slapped that gauge, not Digga
Pull up, bus' the cylinder
Done it like Cinder, left this slipper

Two yutes got shot in the face but I bust that attempted case
Then I got nicked for a stabbing, got no further action, I left no trace
Then I went jail for a next ting 'cause they said that ... got stabbed in a rave
But I don't know who done it, smile on my face when I left that place
Then I came back home, I was gassed
First week out, man banged that mash (Bu-bu)
Then we got put on the obbo
The feds try follow and then we got bagged
Bro, these tips are hollow
Uh oh, I swear this rental's flagged
Dappz don't don't box like Apollo
I swing them shanks and do it, that's facts (Ching, ching, ching, ching)
Four man, three shanks, two bats
And Huncho's coming with more but we got spun then man try dash
I knew it weren't jakes with tasers, saw them lasers stop, calass (Calass)
Back to the can with plugs and socks and breakfast packs

Two on ped, five in the dinger
One in the head, six in the spinner
Back in double tap days, I slapped that gauge 'til I broke that trigger
Back in double tap days, it was Dappz that slapped that gauge, not Digga
Pull up, bus' the cylinder
Done it like Cinder, left this slipper

Two on ped, five in the dinger
One in the head, six in the spinner
Back in double tap days, I slapped that gauge 'til I broke that trigger
Back in double tap days, it was Dappz that slapped that gauge, not Digga
Pull up, bus' the cylinder
Done it like Cinder, left this slipper

Dappz done that, Dappz done this, Dappz done slapped that shotty but missed
Dappz got bad, are you taking piss? Dappz got light and his brown is Chris, cheers
Five man hop in the wiz (Come on now, man)
It is what it is
Who's that callin' Dappz's tizzy?
Took out his ... and slapped that fizzy
Dappz got a pending case (Case)
Did it bait, no drill it, blaze but shaved his face (Ching)
But wait, how could he talk his name?
The amount of words that he's mashed is cray
And I heard that he bought a dotty for six-double-oh so he called it Tay (Squad)
And I heard that shh-shh got bagged with the mash and the mash they found was Digga's (Oh, really?)
Heard shh-shh-shh got nicked for a sawn-off side-by-side two triggers
And I heard that it was Dappz's too (Gas)
And I heard that Dappz got shh
Dappz tried wet 'im but it never went through
Jump off road if he's onto my crew

Two on ped, five in the dinger
One in the head, six in the spinner
Back in double tap days, I slapped that gauge 'til I broke that trigger
Back in double tap days, it was Dappz that slapped that gauge, not Digga
Pull up, bus' the cylinder
Done it like Cinder, left this slipper

Two on ped, five in the dinger
One in the head, six in the spinner
Back in double tap days, I slapped that gauge 'til I broke that trigger
Back in double tap days, it was Dappz that slapped that gauge, not Digga
Pull up, bus' the cylinder
Done it like Cinder, left this slipper
