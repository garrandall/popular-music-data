Just think about it
Just think about it

Lately I've been skeptical
Silent when I would used to speak
Distant from all around me
Who witness me fail and become weak

Life is overwhelming
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
I'd love to be the one to disappoint you when I don't fall down

But you don't understand when I'm attempting to explain
Because you know it all and I guess things will never change
But you might need my hand when falling in your hole
Your disposition I'll remember when I'm letting go of...

You and me we're through and rearranged

It seems that you're not satisfied
There's too much on your mind
So you leave and I can't believe all the bullshit that I find

Life is overwhelming
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
I'd love to be the one to disappoint you when I don't fall down

But you don't understand when I'm attempting to explain
Because you know it all and I guess things will never change
But you might need my hand when falling in your hole
Your disposition I'll remember when I'm letting go of...

You and me we're through and rearranged
You and me we're through and rearranged

You're no good for me
Thank God it's over

You make believe that nothing is wrong until you're cryin'
And you make believe life is so long until you're dyin'

You make believe that nothing is wrong until you're cryin', cryin' on me
You make believe that life is so long until you're dyin', dyin' on me!


You think everybody is the same
I don't think that anybody is like you
You ruin everything and you kept fuckin' with me until it's over and I won't be the same.

Just think about it
You get it
