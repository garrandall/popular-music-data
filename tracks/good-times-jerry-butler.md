Got no job and my pockets
They don't jingle
But as long you belong to me
There's gonna be good times

Then look back, oh
I can't afford to take you places
But as long as you have faith in me
There's gonna be good times

There's gonna be good times
Gonna have the world on a silver platter
And all that's ever gonna
Matter to me is how to make you happy

But for now, now, now, girl
All I've got are hopes to offer
And I know as long as
You're here with me

There's gonna be good times
Gonna be good times, yeah

We'll have the world on a silver platter
But for now yeah, yeah, yeah
