I loved you all the summer through
I thought I'd found my dream in you
For me, you were the one

But that was yesterday
And yesterday's gone

We walked together hand in hand
Cross miles and miles of golden sand
But now it's over and done

Cause that was yesterday
And yesterday's gone

We had such happiness together
I can't believe it's gone forever

Wait til summer comes again
I hope that you'll remember when
Our love had just begun

I loved you yesterday
And yesterday's gone

We had such happiness together
I can't believe it's gone forever

Wait til summer comes again
I hope that you'll remember when
Our love had just begun

I loved you yesterday
And yesterday's gone

Yesterday's gone
Yesterday's gone
Yesterday's gone
