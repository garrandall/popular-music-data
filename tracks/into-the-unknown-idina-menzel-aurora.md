Oh
Oh
Oh


I can hear you, but I won't
Some look for trouble while others don't
There's a thousand reasons I should go about my day
And ignore your whispers, which I wish would go away, oh


Oh
Oh
Oh ah


You're not a voice, you're just a ringing in my ear
And if I heard you, which I don't, I'm spoken for, I fear
Everyone I've ever loved is here within these walls
I'm sorry, secret siren, but I'm blocking out your calls


I've had my adventure, I don't need something new
I'm afraid of what I'm risking if I follow you


Into the unknown
Into the unknown
Into the unknown


Oh
Oh


What do you want? 'Cause you've been keeping me awake
Are you here to distract me so I make a big mistake?
Or are you someone out there who's a little bit like me?
Who knows deep down I'm not where I'm meant to be?


Every day's a little harder as I feel my power grow
Don't you know there's part of me that longs to go


Into the unknown?
Into the unknown
Into the unknown


Oh
Oh ah


Oh
Are you out there?
Do you know me?
Can you feel me?
Can you show me?
Ah, ah (Ah, ah)
Ah, ah (Ah, ah)
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh


Where are you going?
Don't leave me alone
How do I follow you (Ah)
Into the unknown? (Oh, oh)
