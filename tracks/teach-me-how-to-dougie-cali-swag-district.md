Aye! Aye!
Teach me how to dougie (aye!)


They be like smoove (what?)
Can you teach me how to dougie?
You know why?
'Cause all the bitches love me (aye)
All I need is a beat that's super bumping
And for you, you, and you to back it up and dump it!
Put your arms out front, lean side to side
They gon' be on you when they see you hit that dougie right
Ain't nobody fucking with my bro from morning side
He go by bubba and he hit that dance like thunder
I ain't from Dallas but I d-town boogie
I show my moves off, now everybody tryna do me
I leave the function and all the ladies tryna screw me
Now you just do you and I'm a do me (all day)
Niggas love to hate so they try to screw me
Bitches be stuck to me, I think they tryna glue me
I make the party shine bright when it started glooming
This beat was bubble gum so I had to chew it


Teach me how to dougie
Teach me, teach me how to dougie
Teach me how to dougie
Teach me, teach me how to dougie
All my bitches love me
All my, all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me
You ain't fucking with my dougie!


The name is Young!
For the dudes who don't know me
I know I'm from the West but I can teach you how to dougie!
Step up in the club and all these bitches bug me
All the niggas dancing, none of them know me
I hear the crowd screaming like "Aye! get it brody!"
So I'm on my shoulders and I take it real low
They like "How we do that?", he can dougie on the floor
And when that nigga stop they like "Dougie, some more!"
I'm like a nigga kinda tired so, and I pass it to the bro!
M-bone! Show these cats how to do that down south dance
That we learned a little too fast and bought it to the hood
And got the whole crew ask




Back of the party I don't really like to boogie
I'm just tryna get bent and meet a thick redbone
(Mmm) we do the dougie and all them bitches hating
But I'm about to escape with a bitch and head home (fuck it)
She got her friend so it's a two man hand
I wanna run it even if her leg's long
She like you hubby, I think she love me but
I change the subject and I do my dougie
Cause I don't give a fuck, blow trees, get money
Me, Smoove heifen the back with playboy bunnies
We gon' make 'em do the dougie in the middle of the bed
And when I asked for some head this bitch looked at me funny
Dahhhh! Bitch, you can't tell me nothing
Star made the beat, I just took it out the oven
I just see the dougie when everybody clubbing
And I hate skinny jeans 'cause the burner keep rubbing! (oh!)
