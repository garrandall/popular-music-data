If loving you was ice cream
Oh, I could be the ice cream man
If loving you was a whole lot of money
I'd be the richest man in all the land

If a bee made honey
They way that I need you
They wouldn't only make it
In the summertime
They'd make it in the winter too

Cause I love you (I love you)
I love you (I love you)
I love you (I love you)
Good God almighty

If loving you was water
My well would never run dry
If loving you was happiness
My eyes would never, never cry

If my love was a light
(Shining on and on and on)
The dawn would never
Have come around

Well my love would
Shine on and on and on
And the sun would never go round

Angel, I love you (I love you)
I just love you (I love you)
I love you (I love you)
Good God almighty

I love you (I love you)
I just love you (I love you)
I love you (I love you)
Good God almighty

If loving you was time
A second could never slip away
(Slip away, yeah)

If loving you was
A whole lot of power
Girl, I'd rule the world
In just one day

And if hurting you was living
My life wouldn't be worth a dime
I'd die in a day
And I couldn't wait till tomorrow
I do declare, I ain't lying

Oh, angel, I love you (I love you)
I just love you (I love you)
I love you (I love you)
Good God almighty

I love you (I love you)
I just love you (I love you)
I love you (I love you)
Good God almighty

I just love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you...
