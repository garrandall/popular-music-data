I kicks the flavor, like Stephen King writes horror
If I was a Jew then I'd light a Menorah
I got rhymes for ya, excuse me, Se√±ora
Are you a whore or are you a lady?
Is it Erica Boyer or Marcia Brady?
Let me know hon, the deed'll get done
Just assume the position, I'll take my rod
And then I'll go fishing, I'll get your river flowing
I'm always in the knowing
When it comes to giving pleasure, I'm every woman's treasure
I came to work your body, so let me do my job
I've never been laid off, my rhyming skill paid off
Cause now I'm making records, now I'm making tapes
Steady busting suckers in bunches like grapes
Making all the papes, scooping up the loot
Putting suckers on the run, pull my gun and then I shoot
I never been a front, I never been a fraud
I got a natural skill, for that I thank the Lord
Cause I feel blessed, I'm casually dressed
I always got my gun but I never wear a vest
I'm quick on the draw like the horse named McGraw
From the cartoon boom shalock lock boom


(boom shalock lock boom) - alright now
(Boom shalock lock boom) - a little louder
(Boom shalock lock boom) - everybody
(Boom shalock lock boom) - alright now


Breaker, breaker, here comes the caper
Straight with the taper, the lyric skyscraper
Hit you like a lyrical murderer
I know ya think I have, but yo
I never heard of ya
Just because you heard of me kid
Fuck around with D, you do the lifetime bid
I'll put you in the dirt, and leave your ass for dead
When it comes to tools, D's the sharpest in the shed
Cause I'm the '55 Cadillac king
It ain't no thing, my Claddagh ring
Will bust you in the grill
I got the skill, you gots to chill
Cause I bring doom
I got the boom shalock lock boom

I rock mad styles, I hop turnstiles
I rock all mics, I last all night
I puff fat blunts, I rock fine stunts
Step up bo, I'll knock out your gold fronts
Everlast, that's my name
My unique rhyme style's my claim to fame
The House Of Pain's the name of my clique
You can't get down, punk? Get off my dick
You make me sick, like Strawberry Quik
Your style is wack, you ain't the mack
So yo step back, get off the crack
And sing a new tune like boom shalock lock boom
