Call me irresponsible
Call me unreliable
Throw in undependable too
Do my foolish alibis bore you?
Well, I'm not too clever
I just adore you
Call me unpredictable
Tell me I'm impractical
Rainbows I'm inclined to pursue
* Call me irresponsible
Yes, I'm unreliable
But it's undeniably true
I'm irresponsibly mad for you!
* Repeat
