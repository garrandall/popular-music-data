You can reach the top
Or suddenly drop
All your burdens
I'll gladly bear
Just run to my arms
Yeah, right or wrong
No matter what happens
I'll be there
And darling, darling
I'll be there
Whoa, I'll be there
To protect this love we share
If your friends desert you
Yes, when things go wrong
You can always be sure I care
When you face each dawn
And you think you can't go on
You know I'll, I'll be there
Oh, darling, darling
I'll be there
Yes, I'll be there
I'll always, I'll always be there
And darling, darling
I'll be there
Whoa, I'll be there
I'll always, I'll always be there
Whenever you're in trouble
Darling, I'll be there
You know I'll be there
I'll always, I'll always be there
Oh, oh, yes...
