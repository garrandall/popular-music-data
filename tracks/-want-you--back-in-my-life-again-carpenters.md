You know it doesn't seem that long ago
That I had your love and let it go
And I really let you down I know
I'm losin' your love

I guess it took a while for me to see
What it is you really mean to me
I've been as big a fool as I can be
For losing your love


I want you back in my life again
I don't want to be your remember when
I want you back in my life again
Let's go back to the place where it all began
I've lived long enough with your memory
Now I know that I need you here with me

There was a time I thought I had it made
But I didn't see the price I had paid
And the price gets higher ev'ry day
And all I can say is

You're the only one who knows my heart
So let's take it right back to the start
And I won't have to play the part
Of losing your love



You're the only one who knows my heart
So let's take it right back to the start
And I won't have to play the part
Of losing your love

I want you back in my life again
I don't want to be your remember when
I want you back in my life again
Let's go back to the place where it all began
I've lived long enough with your memory
Now I know that I want you, know that I need you
Back in my life
