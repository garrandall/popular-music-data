Sunday morning in Golden Gate Park
People walking, scent of flowers everywhere
I could stay here from dawn until dark
Haven't got a care

Sunday morning and no place to be
I'm as free as clouds that float across the sky
Sunday morning is magic to me
I won't ask why

Who cares where the wind may blow me
I'm not afraid to see
Who cares what cities know me
My mind is flying free

Got no money and no place to be
I'm as free as clouds that float across the sky
Sunday morning is magic to me
I won't ask why

Who cares where the wind may blow me
I'm not afraid to see
Who cares what cities know me
My mind is flying free

Sunday morning in Golden Gate Park
People walking, scent of flowers everywhere
I could stay here from dawn until dark
Haven't got a care

Sunday morning in Golden Gate Park
People walking, scent of flowers everywhere
I could stay here from dawn until dark
Haven't got a care
