Warmer than sunshine, baby
Sweeter than tears
That's how my life has been
Since you first appeared

You opened up my heart
To everything fine
You put a light inside me
And you made me shine

From the time I met you
Everything came true
All I ever dreamed
I found in you


Ooh, you got it
There's no way
I'm gonna live without it
Nothing can stop it
I'm all yours
Cause baby you got it all


You keep me moving, baby
To the beat of your drum
I love what you're doing
And where you're coming from

And when you hold me, baby
It's like we are one
Cause you got a motion
That gets me all undone

When you took my life
And turned it all around
Ooh
You got me flying
Don't take me down




You know I can't control
For what I feel in my soul
My heart is full of you
All I wanna do is to love you
Love you the rest of my life

Keep it coming
Don't stop now
Spread your love around me
Do it now
Do it now



Ooh
You got it
