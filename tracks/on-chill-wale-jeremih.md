We've been on a tragedy for months
Why can't you agree with me for once?
Maybe we can be on chill tonight
Maybe I can give you chills too
We've been on a tragedy for months
Why can't you agree with me for once?
Maybe we can be on chill tonight (One time)
Maybe I can give you chills too (Chill)


I'm gettin' mine like fine wine measured in time
Many other brothers loved you but this pleasure is mine
It's no pressure for us to say that I love you for now
So fuck that cuffin' shit, I just wanna be comfortable now, for real
Who you lovin'? Who you wanna pull up with?
Who don't care who you datin' long as you care and you trust him
Tryna hear all your problems so I can lighten the load
No you not fighting alone, cause I'm protecting you from 'em (so chill)
Life hard and ex lovers is like scars
Cause they stop hurting but never forgetting what it was
I was a youngin' my biggest enemy was the club
With voicemails on third ring fucking me up
So 'on trust


We've been on a tragedy for months
Why can't you agree with me for once? (I'm tryna slow up)
Maybe we can be on chill tonight
Maybe I can give you chills too
We've been on a tragedy for months (Months)
Why can't you agree with me for once?
Maybe we can be on chill tonight
Maybe I can give you chills too (Hey shawty, look)


Okay
They switch up on you I'm gone stay the same, yeah
I pull up on you then put it in with patience
I'm good with what we got, without no expectations
What good is a tidal when shawty been the wave? Yeah
Let me illustrate, yeah
Let my tongue repaint you
It's already wet
Have you had a brainstorm?
Er'where a nigga take you, just know that my face good
Modify your energy so your bank and your skin glow
Max field let it fly
I be up in there a lot
Just to show you I don't care, go wear it to that nigga house
We don't share our whereabouts, or gossip the hood love
Just supreme confidence, if we good that's good enough, woah yeah


We've been on a tragedy for months
Why can't you agree with me for once?
Maybe we can be on chill tonight
Maybe I can give you chills too
We've been on a tragedy for months
Why can't you agree with me for once?
Maybe we can be on chill tonight
Maybe I can give you chills too

How about that?
I'm tired of makin' up and falling out
Wanna be the nigga you callin' up
To pick your body up when you down and out (Let's chill)
How about that?
I'm tired of makin' up and falling out
Wanna be the nigga you callin' up
To pick your body up when you down and out (Let's chill)

We've been on a tragedy for months
Why can't you agree with me for once?
Maybe we can be on chill tonight
Maybe I can give you chills too
We've been on a tragedy for months
Why can't you agree with me for once?
Maybe we can be on chill tonight
Maybe I can give you chills too


Just give me all
Just be there, yeah, yeah
