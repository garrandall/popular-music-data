Calling out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat
Summer's here
And the time is right
For dancing in the street

They're dancing in Chicago
Down in New Orleans
Up in New York City


All we need is music
Sweet music
There'll be music everywhere

There'll be swinging
Swaying
And records playing
Dancing in the street


Oh
It doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long
As you are there

So come on
Every guy
Grab a girl
Everywhere around the world
They'll be dancing
They're dancing in the street


It's just an invitation
Across the nation
A chance for folks to meet

There'll be laughing
Singing
Music swinging
Dancing in the street

Philadelphia, PA
Baltimore and D.C. now
Can't forget the Motor City


All we need is music
Sweet music
There'll be music everywhere

There'll be swinging
Swaying
And records playing
Dancing in the street


Oh
It doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long
As you are there

So, come on
Every guy
Grab a girl
Everywhere
Around the world
Dancing
They're dancing in the street

Way down in L.A
Every day
(Dancing in the street)
Across the ocean blue
Me and you
We're dancing in the street
(Dancing in the street)
