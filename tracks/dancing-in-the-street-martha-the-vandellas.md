Calling out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancing in the street

They're dancing in Chicago (dancing in the street)
Down in New Orleans (dancing in the street)
In New York City (dancing in the street)

All we need is music, sweet music (sweet, sweet music)
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be swinging, swaying, and records playing
Dancing in the street

Oh, it doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on, every guy, grab a girl
Everywhere around the world

They'll be dancing
Dancing in the street

It's an invitation across the nation
A chance for folks to meet
There'll be laughing, singing, and music swinging
Dancing in the street

Philadelphia, P-A (dancing in the street)
Baltimore and D.C. now (dancing in the street)
Can't forget the Motor City (dancing in the street)

All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be swinging, swaying, and records playing
Dancing in the street

Oh, it doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on, every guy, grab a girl
Everywhere around the world

They're dancing
Dancing in the street

Dancing (dancing in the street)
Dancing in the street (dancing in the street)
Way down in L.A. (dancing in the street)
Every day, they're dancing in the street (dancing in the street)
San Francisco way (dancing in the street)
They do it everyday now (dancing in the street)
Across the ocean blue, me an' you (dancing in the street)
Dancin' in the street (dancing in the street)
