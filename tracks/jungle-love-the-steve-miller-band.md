I met you on somebody's island
You thought you had known me before
I brought you a crate of papaya
They waited all night by your door
You probably wouldn't remember
I probably couldn't forget
Jungle love in the surf in the pouring rain
Everything's better when wet


Jungle love, it's driving me mad
It's making me crazy
Jungle love, it's driving me mad
It's making me crazy


But lately, you live in the jungle
I never see you alone
But we need some definite answers
So I thought I would write you a poem
The question to everyone's answer
Is usually asked from within
But the patterns of the rain
And the truth they contain
Have written my life on your skin


Jungle love, it's driving me mad
It's making me crazy, crazy
Jungle love, it's driving me mad
It's making me crazy


You treat me like I was your ocean
You swim in my blood when it's warm
My cycles of circular motion
Protect you and keep you from harm
You live in a world of illusion
Where everything's peaches and cream
We all face a scarlet conclusion
But we spend our time in a dream


Jungle love, it's driving me mad
It's making me crazy, crazy
Jungle love, it's driving me mad
It's making me crazy, crazy


Jungle love, it's driving me mad
It's making me crazy, crazy
Jungle love, it's driving me mad
It's making me crazy
