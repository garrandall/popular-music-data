 Jungle Love! Jungle Love! Jungle Love!
 You know you can't have everything you want, now.
You have to leave 'em wantin' something. 

Well, see, C. C. Rider
Just see what you have done
Lord, Lord, Lord
C. C. Rider, see what you have done
Well, you made me love you
And now I got to move on

Well, I'm goin'
Goin' away, baby
Yeah, and I won't be back until fall
Yeah, I'm goin' away, baby
Won't be back until fall
And if I find me a good gig
I might not be back at all



 Oh, Bobby, I wonder if you know what I'm talkin' about.



 Mr. Bobby Mallach

 Believe it's time to go over to the doctor.
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's true.
We have a doctor of philosophy in the band and whenever we, we need the answer, we have to go over to talk to Dr. Sidran, our musical director.
Are you in tonight, doctor?

 I am in, yes, the doctor is ready.

 Will you take the case?

 I will take the case, it's an interesting case.

 Okay, thank you.



 I feel much better thank you. Mr. Ben Sidran, Dr. Sidran. Yeah. Courage.

 Courage, forward.

 Well, we want to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, you've been a great audience and we have enjoyed playing for you.
We want to remind you that we will be back this summer, and we will play Jungle Love then.
And we'll probably be playing something new.
We want to give you something to think about, and we hope you'll come along with us while we think about it, too.
Happy Holidays everybody.

Well, I'm gonna get me
Get me a pistol
Just about as long as I am tall
Gonna get me a pistol
Just about as long as I am tall
I'm gonna shoot my agent
And then I'll catch that cannonball
