Sometimes, baby, when you're really down
There just don't seem to be a ray of hope around
And everybody that you meet kind of wears a frown
It's cold and lonely in the heart of town
Got to tell you all that

There's a place that's called heaven
Don't you ever forget
Now, once I heard about heaven, yeah
I'm gonna get there yet

Some days you laugh and some days you cry
Sometimes it feels like the world has passed you right by
But everybody's got to find a peaceful place to hide
If you're out looking, take a look inside
And I think you'll find that

There's a place that's called heaven
You might think that's kind of square, oh oh yeah
If you don't believe in heaven, yeah
You ain't never been there

They'll try to bring you down to their way of thinking, yeah
But don't you do it, no no, don't you let it get by (don't let it by)
A little voice inside will tell you
Exactly what you're gonna do
Don't be a fool
Ooh yeah

You don't have to go looking near or far
'Cause you can find happiness standing right where you are
Just open up the windows that are in your heart
And let the light shine, then your life will start
Please believe it that

There's a place that's called heaven
It's filled with joy and peace, whoa oh yeah
And once you get a look at heaven, yeah
You'll find the love that you seek
When all the world is falling down
You'll find a world filled with peace and love and joy
For every girl and boy
And all your troubles will cease

You know, somebody said to keep on pushing
'Cause there's a change that's got to come
She said, "Thank the Lord"
And every day I thank you, Lord
For all the stars and all the seas
And all the birds and all the bees

It's heaven...
