You're a polished diamond
Now you're feeling kinda rough
Yes I know how long you've been searching
For the perfect touch
You better hear what I say
I can tell your eyes are just about to give you away

Cause there's the girl that you were after
Feel your heart beating faster now
There's the girl you were after
Can you say that you don't want her anymore
(oh oh oh waoh waoh oh oh oh)

Just take my word now
Cause you know it's true
She ain't good enough
For the likes of you
You better hear what I say
I can tell your eyes are just about
To give you away

Cause there's the girl that you were after
Feel your heart beating faster now
There's the girl that you were after
And all the time you can't get past her
There's the girl that you were after
Broken glass, complete disaster
There's the girl that you were after
Can you say that you don't want her anymore
(waoh waoh oh oh oh woah woah oh oh oh waoh waoh oh oh oh)

I believed you once
When you explained
That it wasn't so tough
To forget her name

Cause there's the girl that you were after
Feel your heart beating faster now
There's the girl that you were after
And all the time you can't get past her
There's the girl that you were after
Broken glass, complete disaster
There's the girl that you were after
Can you say that you don't want her anymore
(waoh waoh oh oh oh woah woah oh oh oh waoh waoh oh oh oh)

There's the girl
There's the girl......

You don't wanna
You don't wanna
You don't wanna
You don't wanna

There's the girl
There's the girl......
